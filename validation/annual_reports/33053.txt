Earnings per share – basic
Up 47 .8% 2005 has been my first year as Chairman
of Hanson PLC, having been appointed
to the role in April 2005. I am pleased to
be able to report that during 2005 the
group once again achieved excellent
progress against its primary objective,
which is to create sustainable, long-term
value for our shareholders. 
We have grown the group turnover,
earnings and margins of our existing
businesses in 2005 and have added
further value through a number of
significant acquisitions. We have
increased our dividend and share
buyback programme. 
Our operating environment has continued
to change during the year, including
further consolidation of our customer and
competitor base. Both at a strategic and
at an operational level, Hanson believes 
it is meeting these challenges. 
Returns to shareholders
The Board recommends a final 
dividend of 1 4.1 5p (1 2.80p) per share.
This, together with the interim dividend,
makes a total of 20p (1 8.1 5p) for the
year, an increase of 1 0.2%. The “Investor
information” section of this report
provides payment details.
Hanson has continued the on-market
share buyback programme begun in
2004. During the year ended December
31 , 2005, we bought back 8,335,000
shares (6,350,000 shares) for £46.7m
(£26. 1m), equivalent to 1.1% (0.9%) of
outstanding shares.
Board of Directors
After the AGM in 2005, Chris Collins
stepped down as Chairman. On your
behalf, I thank Chris for his tremendous
contribution, initially as an Executive
Director of Hanson and then as Chairman.
We are also grateful for the contributions
over many years of Simon Keswick 
and Kenneth Baker as Non-executive
Directors, who also stepped down
following the AGM.
In August 2005, we welcomed John
Brady to our Board as a Non-executive
Director. John brings with him a wide
experience gained in his years at
McKinsey, latterly as a Director working
on board strategy. 
Corporate governance
Although plans to introduce a mandatory
Operating and Financial Review have
been shelved by the UK government, 
we are required to produce the equivalent
of an Operating and Financial Review 
to satisfy US regulatory requirements.
“During 2005, the group once again
achieved excellent progress against
its primary objective, which is to 
create sustainable, long-term value 
for our shareholders. ”
Mike Welton
Chairman, Hanson PLC
We have expanded this to give
stakeholders in the group an insight 
into the way in which the Board of
Hanson PLC analyses its environment
and operating activities. 
We remain fully compliant with section
404 of the US Sarbanes-Oxley Act
ahead of the requirement for foreign 
US registrants. This underlines our
commitment to strong financial control
and discipline.
Corporate responsibility
Hanson is committed to a programme 
of ongoing improvement in all areas of 
its corporate responsibility.
I am happy to report that for the fifth
consecutive year we saw an overall
improvement in our safety statistics. 
We promote a culture of continuous
improvement in our safety awareness
across all of our operations, with the
Board monitoring formally the group’s
safety performance on a quarterly basis.
The information obtained from these
quarterly reports and from presentations
to the Board is used to identify where
particular attention should be focused
and to assess the effectiveness of 
our approach.
Environmental issues are also 
reported quarterly to the Board. Our
careful management of environmental
issues is an integral part of our overall
business strategy. 
Hanson people
The Hanson team of highly motivated
people is one of Hanson’s greatest
assets. We are dedicated to delivering
increased value to all our constituents
(including shareholders, customers,
suppliers, fellow employees and the
communities in which we operate). 
The introduction, some two years ago, 
of the Hanson guiding principles for
employees is one of the drivers of a high
performance corporate culture. I have
been surprised and delighted by the 
level of expertise and enthusiasm I have
encountered since assuming the role of
Chairman and would like to thank Alan
Murray and the rest of his team for their
efforts and achievements during 2005. 
Looking forward
We expect to make further progress
during 2006 based on strong market
positions, value adding acquisition
opportunities and continued financial
discipline. I believe we have the assets
and the people to realise our objective
and create sustainable value for all our
stakeholders.
Chairman’s statement
Chairman’s statement
2 Our customers
Throughout 2005 as previously, a key
aim has been, and will continue to be to
make Hanson a truly customer focused
company. We believe we should treat our
customers in the same way we would
expect to be treated ourselves – with
courtesy and respect. 
2005 performance summary
I am very pleased with the performance
we have delivered in 2005. We have
achieved double digit earnings growth,
completed a significant number of
valuable acquisitions and increased 
our returns to shareholders. 
Operating highlights
Group turnover
†
increased by 9.8% to
£3,71 5.7m (£3,383.0m), of which 4.2%
was due to the acquisitions we made in
2005. Excluding acquisitions, most of the
5.6% increase was due to increases in
selling prices. Price increases have been
necessary to recover those higher input
costs that could not be absorbed through
cost initiatives. Cost control is an integral
part of our operational culture and 
we continue to strive to be the lowest
cost producer.
In total, group operating margin
†
increased by 0.3ppts, despite the
significant increase in costs, and the
operating profit before impairments
†
increased by 1 5.4% to £488.8m.
Excluding acquisitions and property
income, operating profit before
impairments
†
from the existing business
grew by 1 3.6%. The majority of our 
six divisions contributed to this growth
with a 38.8% increase from the UK
Aggregates division, 25.1 % from
Australia & Asia Pacific, 20.2% from US
Aggregates and 8.7% from US Building
Products. These are excellent results
and more than offset the difficult markets
for our UK Building Products and
Continental Europe divisions in 2005.
Investing highlights
£1 91 .8m of capital expenditure was
invested in capital projects to maintain
and to enhance our existing operations.
In line with our ongoing capital
expenditure policy, we aim to remain
disciplined and biased towards projects
which will have superior risk/return ratios.
In the USA, construction has begun 
on replacement pipe and precast
manufacturing plants in T exas, Arizona
and Florida and the construction of 
a new greenfield roof tile plant near
Jacksonville in Florida. In addition, 
we completed the quarry replant at
Bridgeport, Dallas and secured further
mineral reserves in California. In the 
UK, capital expenditure includes kiln
refurbishment, plant automation and
information technology projects. Plant
upgrades were completed in Australia
and additional mineral reserves have
been secured in Spain.
Acquisitions and disposals
Our strategy to enhance shareholder
value includes the acquisition of
companies which extend our existing
operations or geographies. In addition,
our aggregates acquisition strategy helps
maintain our long-term mineral reserves
and resources position, which totalled
1 5.9bn tonnes at the end of 2005. 
Eleven transactions were completed 
in 2005 for a cash cost of £342.9m
(£88.4m) and included the acquisition
of Mission Valley Rock, which secured
over 54m tonnes of reserves in the San
Francisco Bay area. The acquisition of
Sherman Pipe expanded our presence
in the southeast region of the USA. 
In the UK, the acquisitions of Thermalite
and Marshalls Clay Products have
extended our building product ranges.
Disposal proceeds received in 2005
totalled £50.3m in the year and included
the sale of Hanson’s 50% interest 
in Campbell Concrete and Materials 
in T exas and 1 9 ready-mixed concrete
plants in Spain. 
Safety
We continued to improve the safety 
of our employees. For the first time 
since the group safety records were
maintained there were no employee
work related fatalities in 2005. Our
focus in 2006 is to reduce the number
of accidents and unsafe acts. 
Operating outlook
Demand in the US is expected to 
remain strong but may decline in the 
UK and Australia. The increase in 
energy costs incurred in the latter 
part of 2005 will impact our annual cost
base in 2006, despite our cost reduction
initiatives. We will work closely with our
customers to deliver premium products
and services whilst remaining disciplined
on selling prices.

Consolidated income statement
Group turnover
†
increased by £332.7m,
or 9.8%, in 2005 to £3,715.7m. £1 43.8m
of the increase was due to acquisitions
made in the year, with the majority of 
the balance of £1 88.9m, or 5.6%, due
primarily to the increases in selling prices
achieved by the operations. Excluding
acquisitions, product sales volumes
were generally at or below 2004 levels.
Costs and overheads
†
increased by
£284.6m, or 9.5%, during the year.
£1 26.7m of the increase was due to
acquisitions. The remaining £1 57 .9m, 
or 5.3%, represents the increase in
costs relating to our existing operations.
Energy costs, namely electricity, fuel and
gas, increased by over 20% in 2005. 
In addition, significant raw material
increases were incurred for cement,
bitumen and steel.
The share of joint-ventures’ and
associates’ profit after taxation
†
increased by 74.6% to £40.5m and
includes a one-off tax credit of £6.6m.
Excluding this item, the 46. 1% increase
reflects the strong performance from 
our 25% interest in Cement Australia. 
Operating profit before impairments
†
increased by £65.4m, or 1 5.4% to
£488.8m in 2005. Acquisitions
contributed £1 7 .1m, property profits
reduced by £6.5m and foreign exchange
movements increased profits by £6.4m. 
Profit before taxation
†
increased by
£82.0m, or 23.6% to £429.3m
(£347 .3m). Net finance costs were
£55.5m (£46.8m).
Profit after taxation
†
increased by
£74.7m, or 23.3% to £394.9m
(£320.2m). The group tax charge 
for 2005 was £34.4m (£27 .1m). 
This includes an underlying effective 
tax charge
†
of £58.4m, equivalent to a
rate of 14.9% (15.6%), and a reduction
of £29.6m relating to a net release of 
tax provisions following successful
settlement of a number of issues.
Discontinued items totalled a loss after
taxation of £7 .3m (£56.0m), of which
£13.7m related to asbestos. The gross
cost of asbestos, before insurance, was
US$43.2m (US$59.3m). At this stage,
our estimate of the average annual cost
before insurance over the next eight years
is $60.0m, equivalent to approximately
£21m after tax. In February 2006, a
settlement was reached with insurers
covering approximately 20% of the
group’s present asbestos costs. 
Profit for the year was £387 .6m
(£264.2m), an increase of 46.7%. Basic
earnings per share before impairments
†
increased by 1 8.8% to 55.5p (46.7p).
Interim dividend paid and final dividend
recommended for 2005 totalled 20.0
pence per share, an increase of 1 0.2%. 
Consolidated balance sheet
Net debt increased by £294.4m to
£989.6m (£695.2m) and included 
an increase of £95.7m due to foreign
exchange. T otal equity at the end of
2005 was £2,672.3m (£2,41 1.0m) 
and gearing at the year end was 
37 .0% (28.8%).
Consolidated cash flow statement
The net cash inflow from operating
activities was £471 .2m (£507 .5m), 
a decrease of £36.3m. This is after 
net payments of £64.3m (£53.2m) 
for interest and £54. 1 m (£1 8.3m) 
for taxation.
Capital expenditure totalled £191 .8m
(£198.6m) and £342.9m was spent 
on 1 1 acquisitions. Dividends paid 
were £136.2m in 2005, and a total of
8,335,000 shares were bought back 
for £46.7m, of which £45.1m was paid
in 2005.
Pensions
We continue to make progress in
managing our exposure to pension
liabilities. All defined benefit plans are
now closed to new members, other than
those covered by pre-existing collective
bargaining arrangements. The net deficit
under International Financial Reporting
Standards (IFRS) decreased to 1.0%

Industry and markets
Our industry
We supply heavy building materials and services to the public and private construction
sectors. Our key products include aggregates, ready-mixed concrete, asphalt,
cement, concrete and steel pipe, precast concrete products, bricks and roof tiles.
End use markets and demand drivers
The end use of our products and services may be categorised into residential,
infrastructure, and industrial and commercial construction applications. 
Residential includes public and private housing, and comprises both new build 
and repair, maintenance and improvement (RMI). The level of new housing spend 
in this sector is driven by population growth and demand for new housing offset 
by supply constraints such as house prices and planning permissions. Statistics 
for housing starts and completions are published in several of our major markets,
including the US and UK. RMI work includes DIY spend and is often linked to
consumer confidence.
Infrastructure includes transport (such as road, rail and airports) and utilities
(including water transmission, sewage, power and communications). T ypically,
infrastructure spend on both new projects and RMI is government funded, for
example through the SAFETEA programme in the USA. Infrastructure demand is
driven by demographics, namely population growth, along with government fiscal
policy and priorities and planning constraints.
Industrial and Commercial includes offices and factories as well as schools and
hospitals. This category of construction is funded by both the public and private
sectors and may include public finance initiatives (PFI). Drivers for private spending
include economic growth. T ypically, public spending is driven by political priorities.
Competitive position
Our aim is to establish Hanson as one of the leading suppliers in each of the local
markets in which we operate. This requires a network of well-located operations
which can be used to optimise customer service and transport costs and to leverage
economies of scale. These competitive positions can be strengthened through
acquisitions. Acquisitions can add value through the realisation of operating and
cost saving synergies in areas such as increased asset utilisation and reduced
administrative overheads. 
Vertical integration in aggregates
In some markets, aggregates producers are integrated downstream into ready-mixed
concrete and asphalt production. In addition, asphalt producers may undertake
maintenance contracts and surfacing work. Ready-mixed concrete producers may
have upstream cement operations.
Our focus is on aggregates, but we own and operate ready-mixed concrete, asphalt
and cement operations where this is desirable. 
Economic characteristics
Transportation costs are significant
In general, our products have a low-value to weight ratio. This means the cost of
transport is a significant element of the total cost of our products to our customers.
For example, in some markets the maximum economic road delivery distances for
aggregates may be as little as 20 miles. Consequently, the proximity of our operations
to our customers is important to our overall competitive position in each market.
Delivery to the final destination is principally by road, but we do use alternative
transport such as rail or marine to move products in certain markets. Building products
may have longer economic delivery distances, depending on market dynamics. 
Barriers to entry
Access to mineral reserves, and the ability to obtain the necessary legal permissions
to extract them, is one of the main barriers to entry for our aggregates and brick
operations. These barriers to entry are increasing in the mature markets in which we
operate as planning and environmental controls become more onerous. We aim to
work with planning authorities and local communities to ensure we comply with all
regulatory requirements and maintain a strong reserve position.

Texas, USA. Review of operations continued
Review of operations

Our building products operations have barriers to entry due to the significant scale,
capital and expertise requirements. For example, concrete pipe and precast products
are produced for engineered applications where significant technical expertise is
required in design, manufacturing and sales. T echnological advances afford us the
opportunity for continuous reinvestment and upgrading of manufacturing facilities.
Low substitution threat and low price elasticity
The threat of substitution for most of our products is low. Recycled aggregate
materials are used in certain applications, particularly in the UK, following the
introduction by the UK government of an aggregates levy. We continue to increase
the proportion of high value aggregates produced in our plants.
Service and quality
The service and quality elements of our product offering are essential components
of our product positioning. Examples of important factors in creating value for our
customers in our Aggregates divisions include the technical strength specification
in ready-mixed concrete, the grip and durability of asphalt and the on-time delivery
to site and consistency of size and grade of aggregates. Examples in our Building
Products divisions include colour matching of bricks, strength and precision of
construction of pipes and product availability during peak demand periods for
bagged aggregates products.
Our products
Aggregates
Hanson is one of the world’s largest producers of aggregates. Excluding joint
ventures and associates, we sold over 221 m tonnes of aggregates in 2005, from
more than 380 quarries in North America, the UK, Australia and Asia Pacific and
Continental Europe. Aggregates (sand, gravel and crushed rock) are used in a 
wide variety of applications, including as a base material for road building, in the
construction of rail lines, laying of water transmission and drainage pipeline and 
as landfill. When mixed with cement and other additives, ready-mixed concrete 
or concrete products are produced which are used in a wide variety of building-
related applications. When mixed with bitumen they become asphalt, which is 
used as a surface material for roads, airport runways and car parks. 
Hanson uses aggregates primarily from three sources; land quarried sand and
gravel; marine dredged sand and gravel; and land quarried crushed rock.
The process to extract crushed rock may require “stripping” which is the removal of
overburden material such as top soil and clay from above the mineral deposit. Rock
is blasted in predetermined extraction patterns and hauled to mechanical crushers
by truck or by conveyor belt. Depending on the geological properties of the deposit,
the crushers may be arranged in multiple crushing circuits which separate the rock
into different sizes whilst minimising waste or by-product. The finished rock is shipped
to customers, by road, rail or water or collected by customers from the plant. 
The process for sand and gravel is similar, although reserves tend to be shallower
than for crushed rock, and extraction generally does not require blasting. 
Ready-mixed concrete
Ready-mixed concrete is made from aggregates, cement, water and chemical
admixtures. The ready-mixed concrete is mixed at the plant to ensure it meets the
specified technical requirements, particularly strength, and is transported to site in
a truck which agitates the mixture to keep it homogeneous. Ready-mixed concrete
is used in a wide variety of applications in the construction sector. We supply 
to a wide variety of customers of varying sizes, ranging from major international
construction companies to do-it-yourself enthusiasts.
Excluding joint-ventures and associates, Hanson sold over 20m cubic metres 
of ready-mixed concrete from 637 sites in eight different countries.

Cement
Cement is a fine powder that is produced by mixing calcium carbonate, silica,
alumina and iron ore and grinding them to produce a ‘raw meal’ . This ‘raw meal’ is
then heated and calcined in a kiln at a temperature of around 1500ºC, then rapidly
cooled down to produce an intermediate product in the form of a hard pellet called
‘clinker’ . The clinker is mixed with gypsum and finely ground to produce cement.
Other materials can also be added at this stage such as slag and fly ash to improve
certain characteristics of the cement. 
We sold 1.8m tonnes of cement at our San Francisco (USA) plant during 2005. 
We also own 25% of Cement Australia, which produces cement at its plants in
Queensland, New South Wales and T asmania.
Asphalt
Asphalt is made from a mixture of 90% to 95% of dried aggregates, combined 
with 5% to 10% of heated liquid bitumen. Bitumen is a by-product of the petroleum
refining process and the price of bitumen is, in general, governed by the price of 
oil. Asphalt is used as a surfacing material for roadways and airport runways by the
construction sector. Different types of asphalt surface can be produced depending
on the grade of aggregates used, which will give the surface differing qualities such
as improved grip for vehicles or quieter tyre noise. In certain markets, including 
the UK, Hanson also enters into long-term contracts under ‘term maintenance’
agreements with local authorities for highway upkeep and maintenance. In other
areas of the world, asphalt is sold directly to the end user at a local level.
Excluding joint-ventures and associates, Hanson sold 1 1 .7m metric tonnes 
of asphalt in 2005 from 1 41 plants in six different countries. 
Bricks
Bricks are made from clay, which is extracted from the ground, processed, shaped
and then fired in kilns. Different types of clay produce bricks with differing qualities.
Bricks can be produced in a wide variety of colours and textures and are used
primarily in the housing segment of the construction sector. Bricks are used for 
their attractive appearance, efficient insulation characteristics, low maintenance
and durability. Automation in brick manufacturing is increasing, including the the
use of robotics to improve brick handling. 
In 2005, Hanson produced over 2.3bn bricks at 44 factories in the UK, the USA
and Canada. 
Concrete roof tiles
Concrete roof tiles are made by extruding a sand-based concrete mix onto individual
moulds. Oxides and pigments can be added to the body or on the surface of tiles to
obtain a variety of colours. In addition, different surface textures may be added to the
weather side of the tiles. The tiles are cured, a process which dries and hardens the
product, for a period of approximately one week. They are then ready for installation. 
We manufacture tiles at eight locations across the USA.
Concrete pipes and steel pipes
Concrete pipes consist of gravity flow pipes and pressure pipes, with usage
dependent on the strength requirement of the applications. They are produced 
by embedding a reinforcing steel structure within concrete, and range in diameter
from 25 centimetres to over 3.5 metres. The large-scale structures are used in 
a wide variety of construction engineering applications, primarily infrastructure,
including uses such as drainage systems and water transmission. 
Gravity and pressure pipes are manufactured to rigorous US and international
technical specifications.
Steel pipes are used primarily in water transmission applications and we produce 
a range of steel pipes from 45 centimetres to 3 metres in diameter. 
We manufacture a wide range of large-scale concrete precast pipes and other
similar structures at 76 locations in the USA and Canada. Steel pressure pipes 
are manufactured at one location in Dallas, T exas.

Precast concrete structures
Hanson’s North American precast products are used for roadway drainage, 
airport drainage, stormwater management and utility construction. In addition, 
we manufacture highway noise barriers and railroad level grade crossings. 
The UK precast range includes a variety of flooring systems such as hollowcore
and solid composite beam and block, stairs and landings, culverts, and a
comprehensive range of bespoke precast products.
In Australia, the precast range includes a variety of walling, flooring and
architectural precast products.
Blocks
Aggregate blocks are produced using dense and lightweight aggregates. 
They are available in a variety of densities, strengths, configurations and finishes.
Aerated concrete blocks are produced under the Thermalite brand and are much
lighter than aggregate blocks. They are used by builders and specifiers for wall,
floor and below ground construction, offering added properties of heat insulation,
moisture resistance, strength and ease of handling.
In 2005, Hanson produced 7 .3m standard production units of aggregate blocks 
at nine UK plants and 850k m
3
of aerated concrete blocks at three UK plants.
Our customers
Hanson supplies its products and services to a broad range of customers, ranging
from large multinational construction companies to DIY enthusiasts. Key customers
for our aggregates products include heavy construction and paving contractors,
residential and commercial building contractors, concrete products manufacturers,
state, county and municipal governments and railroads.
Customer service principles
One of Hanson’s guiding principles is that we are customer focused and strive 
to provide premium quality products and services to all our customers. Contact with
customers is through our divisions, at local, regional and national levels. Dedicated
sales teams are the principal day-to-day support for our customer base, with strong
management structures to ensure that strategy, controls and disciplines are adhered 
to. We aim to be ‘best in class’ in everything we do and our commercial strategy and
performance is critical to this objective.
Our mineral reserves and resources
The mineral reserves and resources which we own, or have the right to extract, 
are fundamental to the long-term growth of our business. We estimate that our total
mineral reserve and resources position including Hanson’s share of joint-ventures
and associates as at December 31, 2005 is 15.9bn metric tonnes.
The table following details our mineral reserve and resource position as at 
December 31, 2005. Reserves and resources are defined as follows:
A ‘Mineral Resource’ is a concentration or occurrence of material of economic
interest in or on the earth’s crust in such form, quality and quantity that there are
reasonable prospects for eventual economic extraction. The location, quantity,
grade, continuity and other geological characteristics of a Mineral Resource are
known, estimated or interpreted from specific geological evidence and knowledge. 
A ‘Mineral Reserve’ is the economically mineable part of a Measured and/or
Indicated Mineral Resource. It includes diluting materials and allowances for
losses, which may occur when the material is mined. Appropriate assessments,
which may include feasibility studies, have been carried out, and include
consideration of, and modification by, realistically assumed mining, metallurgical,
economic, marketing, legal, environmental, social and governmental factors. 
These assessments demonstrate at the time of reporting that extraction is justified.

Reserve years and total years are calculated by dividing the tonnes of reserve 
and total tonnes respectively by the volume produced in 2005. 
0.2bn tonnes of the reserves are clay reserves, held by the Building Products
divisions, which are used to make bricks. 
64% of the total reserves at December 31, 2005 are owned. The balance is either
leased, or subject to an option to buy or lease.

Objectives and strategy
Our business objectives
Our primary objective is to create sustainable, long-term value for our shareholders.
We believe this can be achieved only by working in partnership with our customers
and other stakeholders in a responsible manner. 
We aim to enhance the value of our existing assets and market positions by 
growing group turnover, earnings and group margins through the business cycle,
assisted by the appropriate combination of maintenance, greenfield and value 
adding capital expenditure.
Additional value is sought through acquisitions, primarily targeting products 
or locations which can be bolted-on to our existing operations to complement 
or extend our business.
We believe there is an opportunity to significantly add value in the medium term 
and to reinforce our position as one of the world’s leading suppliers of heavy 
building materials.

Our strategy
We operate with a straightforward strategy.
1We plan to focus on growing our core products in selected markets 
–We plan to continue to grow both our aggregates business and our heavy
building products business 
–We do not plan to participate in manufacturing light-side building products 
or in distribution
–We prefer to operate in markets which we consider to be mature, which 
have good demand drivers, high entry barriers and in which we believe we 
have the opportunity to establish and retain a strong competitive position.
2We aim to generate margin improvement
–We intend to notify our customers routinely and in a timely manner 
of price increases
–We operate continuous efficiency and cost saving programmes. 
3We intend to continue to invest in capital expenditure to maintain 
and enhance the performance of our operations
–We aim to maintain capital expenditure at or above our annual 
depreciation charge
–The balance is used to improve health and safety standards, ensure
environmental compliance and replace ageing plant and equipment.
4We intend to continue to generate value adding growth through 
our acquisition programme
–We aim to continue to invest in acquisitions over the medium-term
–Potential targets are evaluated on a discounted cash flow basis against 
our cost of capital, taking into account strategic fit, risk and return targets.
5We are prepared to make disposals of underperforming or non-core 
operations if required
–We are prepared to sell operations if they do not meet our medium-term
ownership criteria although we believe that, at present, we have completed 
most of the required disposals.
6We intend to continue to enforce strong financial discipline in order 
to create long-term shareholder value
–We plan to continue our progressive dividend policy
–We plan to continue our routine and gradual share buyback programme
–We plan to maintain our investment grade debt ratings
–We will continue to be disciplined in our operating, investing and 
financing decisions
–We will not target short-term benefits to the detriment of the longer-term
performance of the business.
Performance indicators 
Background
The Board of Hanson PLC has key performance indicators to measure the 
progress of the Company against both its business objectives and its strategy. 
The Board reviews performance against these measures on a regular basis. 
Key performance indicators 
– Group turnover
†
represents the total amount charged to customers for our
products and services, including delivery but excluding joint-ventures and
associates, inter-company sales, property sales and sales taxes such as VAT.
Our aim is to increase turnover each year through a combination of price and
volume growth from our existing market positions and assets, and additional
turnover from acquisitions.
In 2005, we increased our group turnover
†
by 9.8% to £3,715.7m. Acquisitions
made in 2005 contributed 4.2% of this growth. The increase from the existing
operations of 5.6% was due primarily to increases in selling prices rather than
volume growth.
Group strategy

2 Generate margin improvement
3 Invest in capital expenditure
4 Invest in acquisitions 
5 Dispose of underperforming
or non-core operations
6 Financial discipline

Continuing operations Review of operations

– Group operating margin
†
represents the group operating profit before
impairments
†
, divided by group turnover
†
. The word “group” designates that 
it excludes our share of joint-ventures’ and associates’ profit after tax. Group
operating profit before impairments
†
is therefore group turnover
†
less group
operating costs
†
.
Our overall aim is to grow or maintain margin each year. This is an indicator 
of our ability to offset any cost inflation through productivity initiatives, including
value adding capital expenditure, and through selling price increases. The
margin
†
may be shown before property profits if such profits are significant in 
any given year. The group operating margin may reduce due to either a change 
in the mix of business, or because of a significant increase in both costs and
group turnover which has the effect of lowering margin even if profit is maintained.
In 2005, our group operating margin
†
was 12.1% (1 1.8%), an increase of 0.3ppts.
Excluding property income of £14.9m (£21.4m), the margin in 2005 was 1 1.7%
(1 1.2%), an increase of 0.5ppts.
– Operating profit before impairments
†
represents group operating profit before
impairments
†
(as defined above and before finance costs and taxation) plus 
our share of profit after tax from joint-ventures and associates
†
. Operating 
profit before impairments
†
provides a measure of our success in growing 
group turnover
†
and managing costs and overheads for the group companies, 
as well as the contribution after tax from our joint-ventures and associates
†
.
Our aim is to increase operating profit before impairments
†
each year, 
through a combination of margin improvement initiatives, improvements 
to our joint-ventures and associates and through acquisitions. The increase 
may be shown before property profits if such profits are significant.
In 2005, our operating profit before impairments
†
increased by 15.4% to
£488.8m, and by 1 7 .9%, excluding property profits. Operating profit from
acquisitions made in 2005 contributed 4.3% of the 1 7 .9% increase. The share 
of joint-ventures’ and associates’ profit after tax
†
added a further 4.3%, and the
balance of 9.3% was due to an improvement in the existing group operating 
profit before impairments
†
.
– Profit before taxation
†
is defined as operating profit after impairments
†
, less
finance costs. Finance costs
†
consist of interest payable and receivable on
borrowings and deposits, the expected return on assets, and unwind of
discounts, on pensions and other post retirement benefits, discounting and 
any net change in the fair value of financial assets and liabilities.
Our aim is to increase profit before tax
†
in line with the increase in operating 
profit before impairments
†
. This may not always be possible however, given the
potential volatility of the non-cash impairment amount, and the finance costs
†
due to pensions and the requirement to fair value financial assets and liabilities. 
In 2005, our profit before tax
†
increased by 23.6% to £429.3m, compared 
to a 15.4% increase in operating profit before impairments
†
.
– Profit for the year is defined as profit before taxation
†
, less tax and discontinued
operations. T ax includes current and deferred tax. Discontinued operations
include the cost of asbestos, shown as a loss on disposals in prior years, after tax.
Our aim is to manage our underlying tax rate, and reduce the annual cost of
discontinued operations. In this way, we aim to increase our profit after tax in 
line with the increase in operating profit before impairments
†
. T axation includes
full deferred tax accounting and charges and releases relating to tax provisions,
some of which may vary significantly from year to year.
In 2005, our profit for the year increased by 46.7% to £387 .6m, compared 
to a 15.4% increase in operating profit before impairments
†
.

Continuing operations Review of operations continued
Review of operations

– Earnings per share (“EPS”) on basic, continuing operations before impairments
This is our preferred measure of earnings per share, defined as profit for the year,
adding back impairments and discontinued operations, divided by the average
number of shares in issue during the period (thus excluding shares held in treasury).
Our aim is to increase EPS in line with the increase in operating profit before
impairments, although the potential volatility in the tax charge may affect our
achievement.
In 2005, our basic EPS on continuing operations before impairments increased
by 18.8% to 55.5p per share, compared to an increase in operating profit before
impairment of 15.4%. 
– Net cash inflow from operating activities is defined as the cash flow generated 
by the operations, including dividends from joint-ventures and associates and
payments for discontinued items such as asbestos. It is stated after receipts 
and payments for interest and tax but before investing and financing activities. 
Our aim is to increase net cash inflow from operating activities in line with the
increase in operating profit before impairments
†
. This is an indicator of our ability
to convert earnings into cash. For items such as finance costs and tax, the cash
impact may be a more meaningful measure than the complex accounting in the
income statement.
In 2005, our net cash flow from operating activities reduced by £36.3m, 
or 7 .2%, to £471 .2m, compared to a 1 5.4% increase in operating profit before
impairments
†
. The reduction included an increase in payments for tax of £35.8m
(unusually low in 2004), and an increase of £1 1.1m for net interest paid.
– Acting responsibly within our communities, with our customers and our
employees is a key objective for Hanson. The Board monitors a variety of
performance indicators relating to communities, including charitable donations
and environmental performance. We aim to comply with all relevant requirements
in all jurisdictions in which we operate. 
– Employee KPIs include labour turnover and skills gap monitoring to ensure 
we develop and retain the appropriate skills set within the organisation. We 
also monitor the lost time incidence rate (“L TI”) (a lost time injury is one which
results in the injured person being absent for one or more shifts) and the lost 
day incidence rate (“LDI”). The number of days lost per accident is affected 
by the severity of the accident but also by the effectiveness of case handling 
and return to work programmes. From 2006, we will also monitor the total case
incidence rate which will provide a more sensitive measure as we drive down 
the number of accidents. 
Our incidence rates are per 200,000 work hours (approximating to 100 people
working for a year). This is an internationally used standard. We use incidence
rates as they adjust for changes in the level of production. The lost time and lost
day incidence rates for the last five years are shown in the following graphs.

Other performance indicators
In addition to the key performance indicators detailed above, Hanson uses a
number of other financial and non-financial performance indicators. These include
commercial indicators such as changes in market share, volume and selling price
together with on-time delivery rates and customer satisfaction measures. Cost
control is supported by ratios such as tonnes per manhour and overheads as a
percentage of turnover. Investment decisions are based on risk versus return
evaluation using cash flow projections discounted at a weighted average cost 
of capital. Assets, including mineral reserves, are monitored for quality, age and
replacement need. Financing indicators include interest cover ratios, gearing and
cash flow to net debt. Return on capital and economic value added calculations 
are used to measure and incentivise value creation. 
Our operations 
Hanson operates through six divisions on a multi-national basis within the
construction and building materials markets. These divisions are as follows:
Hanson Aggregates North America, Hanson Building Products North America,
Hanson Aggregates UK, Hanson Building Products UK, Hanson Australia & Asia
Pacific and Hanson Continental Europe.
The Chief Executive of each of these divisions reports directly to the Chief Executive
of Hanson PLC and is responsible for the performance of their division.

Hanson Aggregates North America is one of the leading aggregates producers 
in the USA, operating in 17 states and Mexico. The division is subdivided into four
regions, namely the West, Southwest, Mideast and Northeast, each reporting into
the divisional head office based in Dallas, T exas.
The largest state by group turnover
†
in this division is California. In 2005, California,
Texas and Arizona accounted for around half of the division’s group turnover
†
.
In addition, approximately one-third of 2005 group turnover
†
was attributable 
to New Y ork, Pennsylvania, Ohio and Indiana.
The division sold 129m metric tonnes of aggregates in 2005, and has approximately
1 1.1bn metric tonnes of mineral reserves and resources, either owned or leased,
available for future extraction. All major aggregates operations have at least 1 0 years
of remaining mineral reserve life based on current production levels.

Hanson Aggregates North America delivered another year of earnings
improvement based on sustained operational performance enhancement and real
price growth. 
Group turnover
†
increased to £980.6m in 2005 (£897 .3m), an increase of 9.3%.
£23.7m, or 2.6%, of this increase was due to acquisitions made in 2005. Group
operating margin
†
was held at 14.1%. Excluding property profits, the margin
increased by 1 .3ppts, from 12.5% to 13.8%. 
Operating profit before impairments
†
increased by 8.5% to £138.4m (£127 .6m).
Excluding property profits and acquisition earnings, this increase was £22.9m, 
or 20.2%. 
Average price increases of 7 .8% were achieved in aggregates, which offset
increases in input costs, in particular fuel and power. The price increases ranged
from 5.8% in the Mideast to 13.9% in the West. 
Total market demand across the USA is estimated to have increased in 2005
compared to 2004. There can, however, be significant variation in regional demand
patterns. In our markets in 2005, aggregates volumes in California in 2005 were
below those in 2004, while Arizona and south T exas showed strong demand,
driven by high levels of residential construction and a recovery in industrial and
commercial activity. Reduced activity was experienced, however, in parts of the
Mideast and Northeast regions, most notably in New Y ork, Pennsylvania, Ohio 
and Indiana. In certain markets, we selectively declined to compete for high volume
contracts at low margins. In addition, a number of operations were closed as part 
of our optimisation strategy which further reduced volumes. As a result of this
combination of varying regional demand patterns, selectively declining low margin
work and plant closures, total heritage aggregates volumes declined by 4.4% 
for the year.
Raw material cost pressures were significant in the downstream ready-mixed
concrete and asphalt operations. Average selling price increases of 12.8% in
ready-mixed concrete recovered cost increases, in particular higher cement costs.
Average selling price increases of 11.5% in asphalt in part offset increases in the
cost of bitumen and aggregate raw materials.

In common with aggregates, similar regional variations in demand were
experienced in those markets where we have downstream products, except 
for ready-mixed concrete volumes in Arizona which were adversely affected by
shortages of cement in the second half of the year. As a consequence, heritage
ready-mixed concrete volumes for the year declined by 5.3% and heritage 
asphalt volumes declined by 5.8%. 
Demand for cement in California remained strong in 2005 and volumes increased
by 6.3%. Operational efficiencies at the plant offset part of the significant increases
in the cost of fuel and power. A number of major one off repair and maintenance
programmes were undertaken in 2005. Average price increases of 15.4% were
achieved which, together with the volume increases, offset the increase in costs. 
Capital expenditure
†
initiatives progressed well in 2005, with total spend of £69.4m
(£74.6m). Projects included a processing upgrade at Sylvania, Ohio, which should
increase productivity and reduce costs. In addition, we completed the replant,
including the construction of a new rail terminal, at our Bridgeport quarry near Dallas,
Texas and acquired land in Arizona which should allow us to expand operations in
the Phoenix market. 
Good progress was made this year with our acquisition strategy. The integration of
the Mission Valley Rock acquisition, bought in June 2005, is proceeding according
to plan. This acquisition significantly strengthens Hanson’s position in the strategically
important San Francisco Bay area, with an additional 54m metric tonnes of
reserves/resources secured in this market. In addition, the division acquired a
group of aggregates operations in southern Indiana in December, providing access
to over 1 15m metric tonnes of reserves/resources and strengthening our position 
in the Louisville, Kentucky, market area. An additional 80m metric tonnes of mineral
reserves/resources were secured in Irwindale, California, in 2005.
Outlook
Market demand is expected to remain strong in 2006. Further real price increases
for 2006 were notified to customers in late 2005. Such increases are required to
recover higher input costs and to recognise the increasing scarcity of well-located
mineral reserves and long-term history of below inflation price increases in previous
years. We intend to continue our growth initiatives in 2006, through a combination
of capital investment to improve operating cost profiles and acquisitions to improve
the asset portfolio and to ensure the supply of high quality product to our customers.

Hanson Building Products North America is a leading producer of pipe and precast
concrete, and bricks and tiles, with operations in 25 states and Canada. 
The division is subdivided into four Pipe & Precast regions, and the Brick & Tile
group, each reporting into the divisional head office based in Dallas, T exas. 
Texas is the largest state for this division by group turnover, followed by Florida,
Ontario (Canada) and California. In total, these four areas accounted for
approximately 60% of the division’s group turnover.

This division had a good year in 2005, building further on growth and earnings
improvement initiatives. 
Group turnover
†
increased to £753.7m in 2005 (£647 .4m), an increase of 16.4%.
£28.8m, or 4.4%, of this increase was due to acquisitions made in 2005. Group
operating margin reduced from 17 .2% to 16.5%. This decline is due to changes in
product mix through expansions of our precast operations, the impact of acquisitions
and increases in costs and turnover, which reduce calculated margin, even when
earnings have increased.
Operating profit before impairments
†
increased by 13.0% to £125.7m (£111.2m).
£4.3m, or 3.9%, of this increase was due to acquisitions, mainly the Sherman Pipe
facilities in Alabama and Georgia. Excluding acquisitions and property profit of
£0.5m (£nil), the increase was 8.7%. The impact of foreign exchange was a benefit
of £2.6m. 
Operating profit before impairments
†
for Pipe & Precast increased by £14.7m, 
or 19.3%, to £90.8m (£76.1m), of which £4.3m was due to acquisitions. Average
price increases of 1 2.0% combined with effective cost control and good operating
efficiencies offset input cost inflation in steel, cement and energy. 
Heritage volumes for concrete products increased by 3.1% during 2005. 
The strongest markets for concrete products in 2005 were in the south east
(principally Florida) and the north east (principally South Virginia, Washington 
DC and Ontario). Volumes in key T exas markets were disrupted by the most active
hurricane season on record and by delays on several major pipe projects in south
Texas in the second half. 
Operating profit before impairments
†
for the Brick & Tile group decreased by 0.6%
to £34.9m (£35.1m). Heritage brick volumes declined by 8.2% largely due to a
weakening of demand in Canada where volume declined by 16.1%. By contrast,
volumes in T exas increased by 10.3% as residential demand remained strong in 
this market. Further operating and commercial synergies were extracted from the
combination of our heritage brick operations with the Athens factories that were
acquired in 2004. Average selling prices increased by 6.0%. Price increases of
12.8% were realised in roof tiles. Demand for tiles has outstripped supply in the
eastern USA (principally in Florida), but was offset by lower demand in California.

The division achieved notable success in 2005 with its acquisition growth initiatives,
completing three acquisitions in the year and one in early 2006. The largest of the
three acquisitions was Sherman Pipe which has ten facilities in Alabama and Georgia.
These plants are an excellent strategic fit with the existing heritage facilities in the
south east region. T wo smaller strategic acquisitions were completed in Ohio and
Rhode Island to complement the heritage facilities in the north east region. Initial
integration of these acquisitions has gone very well and all three are performing
ahead of pro forma expectations. In January 2006, the division acquired PaverModule
which is one of the top two suppliers of concrete pavers in Florida.
Building Products’ other major growth initiative is a significant programme of
greenfield capital investment and upgrades to existing pipe and precast and brick
and tile facilities. Capital expenditure
†
in 2005 was £40.7m (£38.2m). Three new
precast plants were successfully commissioned in 2005, two in T exas and one 
in California, which have enhanced our existing product offerings in key markets.
Approval has recently been given for the construction of three new concrete
products facilities in T exas, Arizona and Florida, and for the construction of a new
greenfield roof tile plant near Jacksonville in Florida. Commissioning of these
facilities should occur during the second half of 2006 and the first half of 2007 . 
Outlook
Demand is expected to remain robust overall during 2006. The order backlog
remains strong, at good prices, and was $450m at December 31, 2005 ($400m).
The approval of the SAFETEA programme in August 2005 is expected to support
new infrastructure projects which, together with industrial and commercial demand,
is likely to help to counteract any decline in the residential sector. Input costs, in
particular for fuel and energy, are expected to be above 2005 levels. It is anticipated
that price increases and continued improvement in operational efficiencies, including
further major capital investments in T exas, Florida and Arizona in particular, will help
to recover these increases.

Hanson Aggregates UK is one of the leading suppliers of aggregates, ready-mixed
concrete and asphalt in the UK. Our extensive network of quarries and distribution
links provides national coverage and is complemented by our marine dredging
operations. These aggregates locations are complemented in turn by a network of
ready-mixed concrete and asphalt plants which are strategically located to service
key markets. 
Excluding joint-ventures and associates, the division sold 33m metric tonnes of
aggregate in 2005. It has long-term mineral reserves with approximately 2.2bn metric
tonnes of reserve and resources, owned, leased or under option, available for future
extraction. This includes a strong reserve position in sand and gravel, both land and
marine based.

An excellent year-on-year improvement was delivered by the division in 2005. 
Group turnover

increased to £81 1.5m in 2005 (£771.9m), an increase of 5.1%.
Group operating margin
†
increased by 3.8ppts to 1 1.9% (8.1%). Excluding property
profits, the margin increased by 3.2ppts, from 7 .8% to 11.0%. 
Operating profit before impairments
†
increased by 46.0% to £108.8m (£74.5m).
Excluding property profits, this increase was 38.8%, consisting of a small decline 
in the joint-ventures’ and associates’ profit after tax offset by an improvement in the
existing operations.
The earnings improvement, achieved despite reduced volumes, illustrates our
commitment to pricing discipline, our initiative to increase premium product output
and the delivery of operational efficiency and overhead cost reduction benefits.
Total market demand across the UK for aggregates is estimated to have declined
by approximately 3% in 2005. Much of the reduction is due to a slow down in major
infrastructure activity, and lower crushed rock volumes as recycled materials
compete at the low-value end of the sector. As a result of planned site closures and
our initiative to increase production yields and reduce low-margin, non-premium
products, our total heritage aggregates volumes have declined 8.1%, with crushed
rock the major contributor to the decline. Average selling prices increased by 6.3%,
offsetting input cost increases for fuel and electricity. Royalty rates and the cost of
regulation have also continued to increase. 
Our asphalt volumes increased by 2.5% in 2005 which was broadly in line with
estimated national market growth trends. We continue to benefit from the capital
investment programme to replace our asphalt plants with more fuel efficient and
environmentally friendly units which are capable of utilising recycled materials.
Average selling prices increased by 4.9% as our strategy of introducing higher
value-added branded products came into effect and offset the increased cost of
fuel oil and bitumen. 
The total demand for ready-mixed concrete in the UK is estimated to have fallen by
approximately 2% in 2005, against a decline of 6.0% in our volumes. The relative
reduction in our volume is due in part to the regional location of the work and in part
to our pricing discipline at the expense of lower margin volume. Selling prices
increased by 6.2% during 2005 offsetting higher input costs, particularly for cement,
fuel and electricity.

Commercially, significant progress has been made during 2005 in securing 
long-term maintenance contracts. These are used as a procurement route by 
both the UK Highways Agency and by UK local authorities. Innovative partnering
arrangements with service level guarantees have also been introduced with 
a number of customers. Both these approaches help underpin the long-term 
nature of our order book and support our capital investment programmes.
Capital expenditure
†
during 2005 was £23.1m (£35.6m) and included one 
new ready-mixed concrete plant, aggregate and asphalt plant upgrades and
modifications and additional mineral reserves and resources. We are continuing 
to upgrade our facilities to make them more efficient. In particular, initiatives are
being pursued to increase the proportion of high-quality aggregates as opposed 
to lower-value by-product.
Managing our reserves, particularly sand and gravel, is a high priority for the division.
During 2005 additional sand and gravel reserves and resources were secured in 
a number of locations, most notably in the south east, east of England and east
midlands. In early 2006 additional mineral reserve licences were secured for our
marine dredging operations. 
Restructuring cost savings of £10m were achieved as planned and have resulted 
in a flatter and more customer responsive organisation.
The share of joint-ventures’ and associates’ profit after tax
†
primarily consists of the
50% interests in Midland Quarry Products and United Marine Holdings. Hanson’s
share of net profit after tax
†
of £1 1.9m (£12.3m) was broadly in line with the prior year.
Outlook
Demand is expected to remain subdued in 2006. Input cost inflation, in particular
for cement, bitumen and energy, is expected to continue. In addition, the use of
recycled fuel oil was prohibited from the beginning of 2006 which will increase the
cost burden for our asphalt operations. We are seeking to offset these increases
through cost reduction and efficiency initiatives. However, achievement of our
notified selling price increases will be key to the successful delivery of earnings
growth in 2006. 
In the medium-term, we would expect demand to recover in response to the 
UK’s infrastructure needs and preparations for the London Olympics.

Hanson Building Products UK has a market leading position in bricks, including
London Brick and Butterley Brick. In addition, it produces aggregate blocks,
Thermalite blocks, a range of precast concrete structures, and packed products.
Bricks accounted for nearly half of the division’s group turnover in 2005, and 
blocks for around a quarter. The precast concrete range includes a variety of
flooring systems, stairs and landings, and culverts. Packed products sells a range
of materials for general building and landscaping.

Group turnover
†
increased to £368.2m in 2005 (£300.7m), an increase of 22.4%.
£76.7m, of this increase was due to acquisitions made in 2005. Group operating

Operating profit before impairments
†
increased by 2.7% to £37 .8m (£36.8m).
£12.3m, or 33.4%, was due to acquisitions which offset a decline attributable 
to the existing operations of £11.3m, or 30.7%.
The majority of the £11.3m reduction in earnings from existing operations was due
to lower brick volumes. Whilst our total brick volumes increased by 8.5%, excluding
acquisitions, the heritage brick volumes declined by 12.4%. The reduction has
been predominately within the repair, maintenance and improvement (“RMI”) sector
of the housing market. Despite the reduction, increases in selling prices of 6.8%
were achieved for the year. 
Aggregate block volumes, excluding Thermalite, declined 3.0% whilst average
selling prices increased 2.2%. Precast product volumes, including flooring,
remained strong during 2005. Packed product average selling prices increased 
in 2005 despite lower volumes in the RMI market. 
Input costs, in particular energy, continued to increase although the earnings
impact was partly mitigated by forward hedging of gas prices.
In late 2005 and early 2006, we made the difficult but necessary decision to
reduce production capacity, in response to low market demand and high energy
costs. Production was substantially reduced at four brick factories and temporary
lay-offs were implemented during January 2006 at five brick factories and three
Thermalite factories. In addition, five factories have been closed across our product
range in late 2005 and early 2006.
Capital expenditure
†
in 2005 totalled £16.8m (£16.1m) with an emphasis on
projects which will reduce production costs, increase efficiency and automate
manual handling activities. Included in these was the introduction of a robotic setting
programme at our brick factory at Whittlesey, as well as kiln rebuilds which form
part of an ongoing upgrading of this site. 
Four acquisitions were completed during 2005, for a total of £194.1m, as part of
the division’s strategy of supplying a broad product range to customers. Marshalls
Clay Products has been integrated and is performing broadly in line with expectation.
Thermalite, which has experienced difficult market conditions since its acquisition
in March 2005, performed below expectation but within our acquisition criteria. 
Mid Essex Sand and Gravel, a bagging operation which complements our packed
products range, and Cradley Special Brick are progressing well. The acquisition 
of Red Bank Manufacturing was completed in early January 2006.

Improved customer service and product offering remain key priorities. Multi-product
deliveries are an example of the customer service improvements trialled following
the extension of our product range. 
Outlook
Overall market demand is expected to remain subdued in 2006. Input costs will be
significantly higher in 2006 than 2005. We are working to mitigate these factors by
reducing capacity, improving productivity through capital expenditure and hedging
costs such as gas, where economic. Despite these measures, it is anticipated that
significant price increases will be necessary in 2006 to recover our earnings. 
In the medium-term, we expect demand to respond to the need for additional houses,
particularly in the south east. Our production capacity is sufficiently flexible to be
able to respond to any such increase in volume. We intend to continue to grow this
division through product range extension and ongoing improvements to the service
we offer to our increasingly consolidated customer base.

Of this increase, £14.6m, or 3.5%, was due to acquisitions made in 2005. Group
operating margin
†
reduced by 1.3ppts to 12.3% (13.6%), although group operating
profit before impairments
†
increased by 2.3%. 
Operating profit before impairments
†
increased by £15.1m, or 22.7%, to £81.6m
(£66.5m), including £2.8m of benefit due to foreign exchange translation. £13.8m,
or 20.8%, of the £15.1m improvement was due to the joint-ventures’ and associates’
profit after tax
†
and included £6.6m of non-recurring tax benefit. Excluding this tax
benefit, foreign exchange and acquisition earnings of £0.6m, the existing operations
improved by £5.1m, or 7 .7% against a very strong 2004. 
Our heritage aggregates volumes decreased by 3.4% in 2005, due largely to
significant non-recurring secondary aggregate sales in Queensland in 2004. Victoria
and Western Australia performed well during 2005, offsetting weaker demand in
New South Wales and Queensland. Average selling prices for aggregates increased
6.8%, in part due to changes in product mix. Heritage ready-mixed concrete
volumes increased by 1.3%, with a reduction in Sydney from previously buoyant
levels being offset by increases in all other regions. Average selling prices in ready-
mixed concrete improved by 3.3%, in part offsetting higher raw material costs.

major role. An extensive prototype programme

Review of operations

Operating profit for Building Products declined due to increased input costs 
and a highly competitive pricing environment.
The operational improvement in the joint-ventures and associates was due largely
to improved volume, price and delivery of synergy benefits in Cement Australia.
Three acquisitions were made in 2005 for £12.6m, including a basalt quarry at
Molong in New South Wales, and the acquisition of two Sydney based precast
concrete companies, Rescrete and Abbey Precast, both of which expanded our
building products range.
Capital expenditure
†
totalled £31.6m (£26.4m) and consisted of replacement
ready-mixed concrete and aggregates delivery vehicles, new ready-mixed concrete
plants in south east Queensland and aggregates plant upgrades to increase
capacity and efficiency.
Hanson Asia Pacific
The group operating profit before impairments
†
in this region declined primarily 
due to lower market demand following a reduction in public sector expenditure in
Malaysia. Average selling price increases of between 3.6% and 7 .3% were offset
by a decline in aggregates and asphalt product volumes and higher input costs.
Ready-mixed concrete volume and prices were broadly in line with the prior year. 
In Singapore, the operating performance marginally declined following a further
downturn in construction sector volumes.
The share of joint-ventures’ and associates’ profit after tax
†
increased due largely 
to improved earnings from our Hong Kong operations. Despite a lack of new public
sector work, our Hong Kong concrete volumes have increased year-on-year whilst
selling prices have also improved. Synergy benefits have been delivered in line with
our expectations.
Outlook
The Australian market is forecast to decline during 2006 from its current peak,
while difficult trading conditions are expected to continue in Asia throughout the
year. Further gains are anticipated from operational cost savings. Increased selling
prices will be required to recover the continuing rise in input costs.

reduced by 1.8ppts to 8.7% (10.5%). Operating profit before
impairments
†
reduced by £4.0m, or 16.7%, to £19.9m (£23.9m). 
The £4.0m reduction in operating profit before impairments
†
was due to difficult
market conditions in Israel and The Netherlands, which persisted throughout 2005,
and to quarry closures, which impacted results in Spain. Market conditions in the
Czech Republic and Belgium were more positive. Both these countries increased
their operating profit before impairments
†
, as did Germany, despite its difficult market
conditions. T otal heritage aggregates and asphalt volumes declined by 8.9% and
1.9% respectively across the division, whilst concrete volumes increased by 0.4%.
In Spain, both group turnover
†
and operating profit before impairments
†
decreased
in 2005. Aggregate volumes were below last year due to lower demand in Madrid
and Zaragoza and to the closure of two quarries, although increases in average
selling prices were achieved. During the year we disposed of 19 underperforming
ready-mixed concrete plants. Excluding these disposals, ready-mixed concrete
volumes were ahead of last year, as were average selling prices. 
Weak trading conditions have continued in 2005 for our Israel operations.
Productivity improvements were not sufficient to counter a decline in volume and
the impact of higher energy costs. In the Benelux region, the ready-mixed concrete
markets were difficult, resulting in lower prices and volumes. Efficiency improvements
were achieved in our aggregate operations which helped to offset a reduced
operating profit before impairments
†
.
Outlook
The Spanish economy is anticipated to remain strong during 2006, although further
reserve exhaustion is expected to lead to a lower operating profit before impairments
†
.
Elsewhere, the market in Israel is likely to remain difficult, ready-mixed concrete
margins in The Netherlands may improve slightly and volumes in the Czech Republic
may decline slightly as a major road building contract concludes. 
Replenishment of our reserves position, either through acquisition or mineral reserve
purchases, remains a high priority for 2006. We will continue to focus on both
acquisitions and margin improving capital expenditure activities.

The following section provides the financial review for 2005.
Operating profit before impairments
Operating profit before impairments
†
was £488.8m (£423.4m), an increase of
£65.4m or 15.4%. This consists of the operating profit before impairments
†
for
each of the six divisions as described in the operating review, which totalled
£520.3m (£446.1m), less central expenses of £31.5m (£22.7m). The increase 
in central expenses of £8.8m includes £4.4m relating to a bodily injury claim in 
the USA, which is self-insured centrally by the company.
Operating impairments
†
Operating impairments
†
in the period were £4.0m compared with £29.3m in the
previous year. The net charge for the year consists of £23.6m of impairment charges,
offset by a reversal of £19.6m. The charges relate primarily to the US and UK
aggregates divisions. The reversal follows an economic improvement in the supply
arrangements at certain operations in the US aggregates division and additional
disposal proceeds at certain UK aggregates sites.
Exchange impact 
Foreign exchange translation increased group turnover
†
by £35.2m, operating profit
before impairments
†
by £6.4m and profit before tax
†
by £6.0m. 
The US dollar year end exchange rate moved from $1.9199 at December 31, 2004
to $1.71 68 at December 31, 2005. The net impact of foreign exchange movements
resulted in an increase in sterling translated net debt from December 31, 2004 to
December 31, 2005 of £95.7m.

Finance costs and income
†
Net finance costs
†
were £55.5m (£46.8m). 
Interest payable on loans totalled £1 19.0m (£92.2m) against interest receivable 
of £60.1m (£40.0m), resulting in a net interest cost of £58.9m (£52.2m). The main
reason for the increase in the net interest charge was an increased level of net debt
following the acquisitions made in 2005.
Interest cost on the pension plan liabilities and other post-retirement benefits was
£1 03.2m (£99.2m), offset by an expected return on pension assets of £1 08.7m
(£111.2m), to give a net pension finance income of £5.5m (£1 2. 0m). The reduction
in income resulted primarily from a reduction in interest rates. 
The unwind of the discounting relating to long-term provisions was a charge 
of £2.5m (£6.6m), and included the impact of a change in discount rates.
Taxation on continuing operations
Taxation on continuing operations was £34.4m (£27 .1m). The 2005 charge
consisted of an underlying tax charge, excluding the tax relating to joint-ventures
and associates, of £58.4m, a net release from provisions of £29.6m and a charge
of £5.6m relating to impairments. The 2004 tax charge has been restated by
£49.6m following a change in the interpretation of the deferred tax accounting
requirements under IFRS. The restatement resulted in a charge of £27 .1m for
2004, which consists of an underlying tax charge, excluding the tax relating to 
joint-ventures and associates, of £55.1m, one-off deferred tax credit after
restatement of £21 .7m and a tax credit on impairments of £6.3m. 
The underlying tax charge of £58.4m (£55.1m) was equivalent to an underlying
effective tax rate of 14.9% (15.6%) on the profit before tax and impairments,
excluding joint-ventures and associates, of £392.8m (£353.4m).
The net provision release in 2005 of £29.6m resulted from the successful resolution
of a number of issues with the relevant tax authorities.
Discontinued operations
Current year loss after taxation of discontinued operations was £7 .3m (£56.0m). 
The profit after tax earned by operations in 2005 prior to their disposal was £2.8m.
Hanson Aggregates North America sold its 50% interest in the joint-venture
Campbell Concrete and Materials, a ready-mixed concrete business operating in
Houston, T exas on June 1 7 . Hanson Continental Europe disposed of 19 ready-mixed
concrete sites on May 13, and has subsequently restructured its Spanish operations.
Seagoe, a drainage business based in Northern Ireland, was included in discontinued
as a disposal group held for sale. Seagoe was sold in January 2006. 
The profit after tax arising from the sale of the above operations was £2.3m.
A loss after tax of £12.4m (£50.0m) resulted from operations that were discontinued
prior to 2004. The main item in this category was an asbestos charge of £22.4m
(£79.7m) before tax and £13.7m (£40.6m) after tax.
Asbestos
Various of the Company’s US subsidiaries are defendants in a number of lawsuits
alleging bodily injury due to exposure to asbestos-containing products before
1984. New claimants were 10,350 for 2005 compared with the 18,700 new
claimants received in 2004. At the end of 2005, outstanding claimants totalled
approximately 131,350 (135,750). Of the 14,750 (7 ,150) claimants whose cases
were resolved during 2005, over 90% were dismissed without payment.
In the USA, claimants can often file claims without illness or product identification.
In the absence to date of federal reform, a number of states have introduced reform
measures. Although outstanding claimants decreased at the end of 2005 compared
to 2004, this does not mean we believe this is the start of a downward trend in the
number of claimants. 
†
Continuing operations The gross cost of resolving asbestos claims in 2005 was $43.2m ($59.3m)
including legal fees of $26.3m ($27 .4m). The net cost of asbestos for the year 
after insurance was $31.7m ($12.8m). 
The Company’s approach to accounting for the asbestos claims against these US
subsidiaries is to provide for those costs of resolution which are both probable and
reliably estimable. The costs of resolving possible claims are disclosed as contingent
liabilities. At present, based on detailed analysis and the assumptions referred to in
note 21 of the Notes to the accounts, the provision for those costs which are both
probable and reliably estimable equates to approximately eight years of gross cost
assuming annual gross costs of $60.0m. The full year increase in the provision for
future asbestos costs was $60.0m ($222.5m), taking the gross provision to
$496.8m ($480.0m) before the impact of discounting, which has reduced the
provision to $398.6m ($401.2m), or £232.2m (£209.0m).
Offsetting this is approximately $14.6m ($26.1m) of remaining insurance cover 
at December 31, 2005. The insurance settlement reached in February 2006 and
detailed in note 31 of the Notes to the accounts will result in an additional insurance
asset of approximately $60m being recognised on January 1, 2006. In addition to
this settlement, we will continue to use a combination of litigation and negotiation 
to maximise further insurance cover.
The net cost of resolution is allowable for US tax at a rate of 39%. Following the
recent insurance settlement, the estimated net cost of approximately $48.0m is
equivalent to approximately $29.0m post-tax, or £16.0m, 3.4% of net cash inflow
from operating activities of £471.2m (£507 .5m.)
Dividends
The 2005 interim dividend paid and final dividend recommended total 20.0p
(18.15p), an increase of 10.2% on 2004. The sustained increase in our dividend
payout reflects our confidence in the underlying strength of the group and its 
ability to generate strong cash flows.
Earnings per share
Basic earnings per share in 2005 were 53.2p (36.0p), up 47 .8% on last year. 
EPS on continuing operations before impairments were 55.5p (46.7p), up 1 8.8%
on last year.

Continuing operations Cash flow
Net cash inflow from operating activities for 2005 was £471.2m (£507 .5m). 
This includes £10.6m (£4.3m) paid for asbestos costs, net of insurance. T axation
paid was £54.1m (£18.3m) compared to the tax charge
†
of £34.4m (£27 .1m). 
The increase in tax payment results from increased earnings and reduced first year
capital allowances in the USA. Net interest paid was £64.3m (£53.2m) compared
to a net finance cost of £55.5m (£46.8m).
Capital expenditure
Capital expenditure
†
for the purchase of property, reserves, new and replacement
plant and equipment during the year totalled £196.1m (£201.1m) of which £191.8m
(£198.6m) was paid in 2005. This represented 122.0% of continuing depreciation.
Over half of this amount has been spent in North America. A further £123.1m of
capital expenditure had been committed as at December 31, 2005 primarily for
new building products plants in the USA. These capital expenditures are expected 
to be financed out of group cash flows and bank facilities.
The group continues to identify and invest in projects which are intended to reduce
operating costs and expand and enhance the performance of our divisions.

Marshalls Clay Products for £64.7m and Thermalite, a market leader in aircrete
blocks, on March 7 for £124.2m. On June 17 , Hanson Aggregates North America
acquired the assets of Mission Valley Rock, Berkeley Ready Mix and Berkeley
Asphalt, and Hanson Building Products North America acquired the assets of
Sherman Pipe, a concrete pipe and precast concrete products business for a 
total of £108.0m. Other acquisitions made in the year consisted of three quarries 
in Southern Indiana by Hanson Aggregates North America in December, and a
further six acquisitions totalling £46.0m. 
Capital structure and share buyback programme
The capital structure of the group takes account of the needs of our equity
shareholders to maximise return on equity whilst recognising that to do so requires
access to the debt capital markets. Our debt ratings are carefully managed and 
we maintain an inclusive relationship with the major rating agencies to ensure
consistent ratings over the medium-term. Key credit ratios are closely monitored
and reviewed as part of our planning process.
The group continually reviews its level of debt and equity. Following a four year
period of debt reduction, Hanson commenced an on-market share buyback
programme during October 2004. During the year ended December 31, 2005
8,335,000 shares were bought back and held as treasury shares for £46.7m, of
which £45.1m was paid in 2005. At December 31, 2005 there were 14,685,000
ordinary shares in issue which are held in treasury. The share buyback programme
is a rolling return of that capital which we believe is in excess of our medium-term
requirements and which is reviewed on a continuing basis in the context of our 
cash flow, capital expenditure and acquisition plans.

Balance sheet and provisions
Total equity is £2,672.3m (£2,411.0m) at December 31, 2005. The transfer to
reserves from the income statement was £387 .6m less amounts for dividends paid
of £136.2m. The effect of currency movements increased total equity by £56.8m. 
Provisions totalled £552.3m (£541.8m) at December 31, 2005.
Pensions and other post retirement benefits
During 2005 Hanson, together with the relevant trustees, continued to monitor the
funding and asset allocation policies of the main UK and US defined benefit plans.
The group has adopted a funding policy that targets the accrued benefit obligation,
which is higher than applicable statutory minimum funding levels in each country.
Total contributions by the group for its pension and other post retirement obligations
were £68.1 m, principally in the USA, Canada, the UK and Australia. As at December
31, 2005, the net liability in relation to defined benefit pension plans was £20.8m
(£48.5m) and the net liability relating to post-employment medical benefits was
£103.3m (£80.4m). Over recent years, movements in market value apart, the
group’s defined benefit plans have generally moved toward asset allocations with
lower levels of risk. At the end of 2005, 58.3% (53.7%) of defined benefit plan
assets were in bonds, property and cash. Details of contributions to the pension
plans, market value of assets and amounts recognised in the balance sheet can 
be found in note 28 of the Notes to the accounts.
Off balance sheet arrangements
The group’s off balance sheet arrangements consist of the following, as referred 
to in the Notes to the accounts: 
– operating leases (notes 3 and 27)
– commitments to capital expenditure (note 13)
– guarantees, letters of credit and surety bonds (note 26)
Other than as disclosed, there are no off balance sheet arrangements that have, 
or are reasonably likely to have, a current or future material effect on the group’s
financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results 
of operations, liquidity, capital expenditure or capital resources.

Notes to the accounts
Risk management
The group Risk Committee, which includes all of the Executive Directors of the
Company and other senior managers, is responsible, under delegated authority
from the Board, for reviewing the group risk position and ensuring appropriate risk
mitigation is in place. In carrying out this role, the Risk Committee reviews audit
reports, risk assessment returns, including those for T urnbull, as well as regular
management reports.
Funding, liquidity and treasury management
The group’s financial risk policy identifies risks and sets out a control framework 
for managing exposures. This policy is approved by the Board and covers interest
rate, foreign exchange and credit risks. It also sets out policies for funding and
liquidity management. The Risk Committee has delegated authority from the Board
to monitor and review these policies, approve the adoption of new instruments in
accordance with group policies and approve any changes to policy implementation.
Operating within the strict controls of these policies, the Treasury department
manages these financial risks, ensuring in particular that sufficient funding and
liquidity is available to meet the expected needs of the group. 
In addition to the high level of free cash flow of the group, Hanson operates a prudent
approach to liquidity management using a mixture of long-term debt together with
short-term cash and investments.
Our core funding is provided by two US bond issues, each of $750m, maturing 
in September 2010 and March 2013, respectively. A third US bond of $750m
matured in September 2005. The group also has substantial committed bank
facilities which total £947 .7m, the principal components of which are a new £500m
facility expiring in 2010 and a $475m facility expiring in 2009. The new £500m
facility replaced a five year £519.2m facility due to expire in March 2006. At the
balance sheet date, £244.2m of committed bank facilities were utilised by way 
of letters of credit and cash drawings. The level of unused facilities, together with
other resources available to the group, is such that we believe that we have sufficient
funding to satisfy our working capital requirements in the near to medium-term.

Group credit facilities contain a financial covenant broadly consistent with, but less
restrictive than, the group’s interest cover target. The group does not, therefore,
anticipate that this covenant will restrict funding or investment strategies in the
foreseeable future.

Financial review
42 Credit risk
The Board’s policy is that credit risk for financial transactions should be restricted
to counterparties with a minimum A-/A3 credit rating for long-term transactions and
F2/P-2/A2 for short-term transactions. In addition, there are individual counterparty
and country limits for cash and short-term investments.
Hanson’s credit ratings, which are a key determinant of the terms on which the 
group can issue debt, were unchanged during the year as shown below:
Short-term Remaining
Fitch F2 BBB+
Moody’s P-2 Baa1
Standard & Poor’s A2 BBB+
Interest rate risk
The group’s policy for interest rate risk is designed to limit the group’s exposure 
to fluctuating interest rates. This is achieved by limiting the level of floating interest
rate exposure to a maximum determined by both the level of debt and the level of
operating profit of the group at any point in time. This approach, which is consistent
with our target for ongoing leverage, will mean, other things being equal, that for
any given level of debt, a higher level of operating profit will result in a higher limit 
on the level of floating rate debt in the group (and vice versa). Consistent with this
policy, at December 31, 2005, the group held 56% (77%) of net debt at fixed rates.
For further details, see note 29 of the Notes to the accounts.
Foreign exchange risk
Due to the nature of our products, which are generally uneconomic to transport
long distances, there are few foreign exchange transaction exposures in the course
of our day-to-day business. However, the majority (67%) of our capital employed 
is in overseas locations and is denominated in foreign currencies, principally US
dollars (42%). As a consequence, changes in exchange rates affect both reported
profit and asset values. The exposure of asset values to foreign exchange rates is
controlled to an extent by matching a proportion of currency assets with currency
liabilities, using both debt and foreign exchange contracts. This means that falling
overseas exchange rates will give rise to both falling asset values and lower levels
of net debt in sterling terms. The interest cost of currency liabilities also provides 
a partial hedge for foreign currency income. 
Critical accounting policies 
The following section explains where, in these financial statements, we have
exercised judgement in applying the group’s key accounting policies and critical
estimates in areas which are by their nature inherently uncertain. Although we have
used all of the information currently available to us in making such critical estimates,
changes to our assumptions in these areas could materially affect the financial
results and position shown in this document. Hanson’s significant accounting
policies in accordance with IFRS are set out on pages 74 to 77 of the Annual
Report and Form 20-F . Where estimates have been used, it is possible that over
time the actual results upon which the judgement was based could differ from
those estimates.
The group considers the following are the critical policies where assumptions and
judgements could have a significant impact on the consolidated financial statements.
Legal and other disputes
Various of the group’s subsidiaries are subject to a number of legal disputes, the
most significant being asbestos claims against a number of its US subsidiaries.
Provisions for anticipated settlement costs and associated expenses arising from
legal and other disputes are made where a reliable estimate can be made of the
probable outcome of the dispute. Where it is not possible to make such an estimate,
no provision is made. Our approach to providing for asbestos is explained in note
26 of the Notes to the accounts.
Financial review
43 Environmental obligations
Various of the group’s subsidiaries are also subject to environmental obligations 
for clean-up and remediation costs, pursuant to environmental laws and regulations.
Provisions are made for environmental obligations and related costs which are
probable and reliably estimable and where a legal or constructive obligation to
remedy-known exposures exists. The ultimate requirement for such actions, and
their costs is inherently difficult to estimate and is based on current information on
costs and expected plans for remediation. Actual costs can differ from estimates
over time because of changes in existing laws and regulations, public expectations,
new sites arising and unknown conditions being encountered.
Impairment
The group applies IAS 36 “Impairment of Assets” under IFRS and SFAS 144
“Accounting for the impairment of long-lived assets and for long-lived assets to 
be disposed of” together with SFAS 142 “Goodwill and other intangible assets”
under US GAAP .
Under IFRS, the group compares the carrying value of goodwill and tangible
assets, with the higher of their net realisable value and value in use (explained
below), to determine whether an impairment exists. Under US GAAP , the group
assesses the fair value and recoverability of goodwill by comparing the implied 
fair value of goodwill with the actual goodwill attributable to a reporting unit. 
Value in use is calculated by discounting the cash flows expected to be generated
by the asset/group of assets, being tested for evidence of impairment. The use 
of different estimates, assumptions and judgements, in particular those involved 
in (a) determining a value based on our current expectations of future industry
conditions and the associated cash flows from the group’s operations, but also
those involving our future intentions for assets which are currently non-operational,
(b) our determination of the level at which groups of assets can be reasonably
tested for impairment separately from other parts of the business and (c) our
treatment of centrally held assets, could each result in materially different carrying
values of assets and assessments of impairment. 
Pensions and other post-retirement benefits
Under IFRS, the group applies IAS 19 “Employee benefits” . Under US GAAP , the
Company applies SFAS 87 “Employers’ Accounting for Pensions” and SFAS 106
“Employers’ Accounting for Post-retirement Benefits Other Than Pensions” .
These accounting standards require the group to make assumptions including, but
not limited to, future asset returns, rates of inflation, discount rates, life expectancies
and health care costs. The use of different assumptions, in any of the above
calculations, could have a material effect on the accounting values of the relevant
assets and liabilities which could result in a material change to the cost of such
liabilities as recognised in the income statement over time. These assumptions are
subject to periodic review. See note 28 of the Notes to the accounts for additional
information regarding the group’s pension and other post-retirement benefits.

44 Principal risks and uncertainties
Principal risks and uncertainties

Our business, financial condition and
results of operations, and consequently
the price of the Hanson shares and the
amount and timing of any dividends that
we pay, will be influenced by a range 
of factors, many of which are beyond 
the control of Hanson and its Board. 
The risk factors set out below and the
other information in the Annual Report
and Form 20-F should be considered
carefully. There may be other risks which
are not known to the Company or which
may not be material now but could turn
out to be material.
Risk management
The Board of Hanson PLC reviews the
effectiveness of the system of internal
control, covering, inter alia financial,
operational, compliance and risk
management, at least annually.
Changes in economic conditions could
have a material adverse effect on the
level of demand for Hanson’s products. 
Our performance is affected significantly
by changes in economic conditions, both
globally and in the particular countries 
in which we conduct our operations,
especially in the USA, the UK and
Australia where we have our most
significant operations. The demand 
for our products, which are mainly
aggregates, concrete products, ready-
mixed concrete, asphalt and clay bricks,
is closely linked to general economic
conditions in each of the territories in
which we operate. As a result, depressed
economic conditions could have an
adverse effect on demand for, and pricing
of, our products, which could result in
reduced sales and reduced profits.
Changes in government policy or
legislation relating to public works
expenditure and housing could have 
a material adverse effect on the levels 
of demand for Hanson’s products. 
National governments’ policies with
regard to the development of transport
infrastructure and housing have 
a significant effect on demand for 
our products and, as a result, our
profitability. Decreases in governmental
funding or in the allocation of those
funds for transport infrastructure and
housing projects could reduce the
amount of money available for spending
on our products, potentially thereby
reducing sales and profits.
For example, the move towards 
inner-city residential development in 
the UK, and consequently an increase 
in the number of apartments being built
in place of houses, has reduced the
demand for bricks.
Inclement weather conditions 
could significantly impact levels 
of construction activity and hence
demand for Hanson’s products. 
Extended periods of inclement weather,
especially periods of heavy or sustained
rainfall during peak construction periods
during the year and other acts of nature
such as hurricanes, can result in a
material reduction in demand for our
products at important times, as well 
as impact our ability to produce our
products, and consequently result in
reduced revenues and profits. 
Hanson operates in an extremely
competitive market. 
Most, if not all, of the markets in which
we operate are extremely competitive.
The competitive environment in which
we operate can be significantly affected
by local factors, such as the number of
competitors and production capacity in
the local market, the proximity of natural
resources to the local market and
economic conditions and product
demand in the local market. The pricing
policies of competitors and the entry of
new competitors in the local markets in
which we operate can have an adverse
effect on the demand for, and price of,
our products and on the results of our
operations and profitability.
Changes in government policy or
legislation relating to planning, the
environment, health and safety and
industry related tax could significantly
affect Hanson’s industry related
regulatory compliance and other
operating costs and Hanson’s ability 
to establish additional reserves. 
Our performance is affected
significantly by national and/or local
government policy and legislation in 
the regions and territories in which 
we operate. Many of our products are
subject to government regulation in
various jurisdictions regarding their
production and sale, and our operating
units are subject to extensive regulation
by national and local agencies
concerning such matters as planning
and environmental and health and safety
compliance. Numerous governmental
permits and approvals are required for
our operations. We believe that our
operating units are currently operating 
in substantial compliance with, or under
approved variances from, various Principal risks and uncertainties continued
Principal risks and uncertainties
46
national and local regulations in all
applicable jurisdictions. In the past, 
our subsidiaries have made significant
capital and maintenance expenditures 
to comply with planning, water, air and
solid and hazardous waste regulations,
and these subsidiaries may be required
to do so in the future in order to ensure
business continuity.
The existence of these national and 
local regulations in many jurisdictions 
in which we operate also means that it is
often difficult to establish new greenfield
aggregates reserves and brick factories
with clay reserves in areas where
demand would justify the capital
expenditure required.
The imposition of industry related taxes
such as the Aggregates Levy and the
Climate Change Levy in the UK increase
our costs and encourage imports of
competing products and product
substitution.
Disruption to, or increased costs of, 
the supply of materials, energy and fuel
to Hanson and the supply of finished
products to Hanson’s customers could
significantly reduce Hanson’s profitability.
We are a significant purchaser of
materials, energy and fuel, including
cement for use in our ready-mixed
concrete and concrete product
operations, steel for use in our concrete
product and steel pipe operations,
bitumen for use in our asphalt activities,
gas and other energy supplies for use 
in our cement and brick manufacturing
operations and fuel for the processing
and transport of our products. The 
cost of such materials, energy and 
fuel fluctuates, sometimes by material
amounts. Increases in the costs of 
such materials, energy and fuel or their
non-availability, can significantly impact
our costs and disrupt our operations.
The profitability of our operations could
be adversely affected if we are not able
to recoup such costs in the prices of 
our products.
Transport logistics play an important
part in the group’s supply chain, whether
by road, rail, sea or river, and any material
disruption/or non-availability of such
transport support could significantly
impact operating costs and reduce
profitability.
Increased employment costs could
significantly reduce Hanson’s profitability.
We are a significant employer of labour
and any increased costs of employment,
including pension and post-retirement
healthcare costs, could significantly
impact operating costs and consequently
reduce profitability. The group has
several funded defined benefit pension
plans, which cover a majority of the
group’s employees who participate 
in the group’s pension plans. Hanson
also provides benefits from unfunded
non-qualified plans in the USA and post-
retirement employee benefits in the USA
and Canada. Various assumptions are
made in calculating our assets and
obligations under our pension plans
which, if incorrect, could have a material
adverse effect on our financial condition. 
Ineffective implementation of computer
software systems could significantly
reduce Hanson’s profitability. 
The implementation of software to
improve the efficiency and effectiveness
of various business processes is an
important contributor to our ongoing
operations and growth strategy. Failure
to design, select appropriate suppliers
or implement such systems effectively
could result in unplanned costs or
reduced levels of customer satisfaction
which could adversely affect the results
of our operations and profitability.
Hanson’s acquisition strategy may 
be unsuccessful due to an inability to
identify suitable acquisition targets and
to integrate acquired companies into 
its business. 
We plan to continue making selective
acquisitions to strengthen, develop and
expand our existing aggregates, concrete
products, ready-mixed concrete, asphalt,
clay bricks and related heavy building
material activities. 
The successful implementation of our
acquisition strategy depends on a range
of factors, including our ability to identify
appropriate opportunities, complete
acquisitions and achieve an acceptable
rate of return from those acquisitions,
including past acquisitions. There may
also be substantial challenges or delays
in integrating and adding value to 
the businesses which we acquire. In
addition, the costs of integration, which
are not presently capable of being
estimated, could be material and the
projected synergies resulting from 
such acquisitions may not be realised.
Material costs or delays in connection
with the integration of the operations
that we acquire or the inability to realise
synergies from those acquisitions could
result in increased expenditure and,
consequently, reduced profitability 
and rates of return for us from such
acquisitions. Hanson is subject to risks relating 
to changes in exchange rates. 
In the year ended December 31, 2005,
approximately 76% of our operating
profit before impairments
†
was earned 
in currencies other than pounds sterling,
and a significant portion of our revenue
is denominated in US dollars. 
At December 31, 2005, approximately
67% of our capital employed was located
outside the UK, and approximately
148% of our net debt and foreign
exchange contracts were denominated
in currencies other than pounds sterling.
Since our results are reported in pounds
sterling, exchange rate movements
affect our reported profits, assets, cash
and debt balances. This effect may be
positive or negative depending on the
nature of the actual exchange rate
movement and the nature of any currency
hedging instruments that we have put 
in place. Fluctuations in exchange rates
could have a material adverse effect on
our financial condition and results of
operations to the extent that we have 
not effectively hedged against those
exchange movements. 
Adverse changes in tax legislation may
affect Hanson’s ability to maintain its tax
rate below the UK statutory rate.
The underlying effective group tax rate
for 2005 was 14.9% compared to a 
UK statutory rate of 30%. Hanson’s 
tax charge is subject to changes in
legislation. Such changes in legislation
may be implemented at short notice and
may affect Hanson’s ability to maintain
its underlying tax rate below the UK
statutory rate of 30%.
We are unable to reliably estimate 
all costs associated with asbestos-
related claims.
With respect to asbestos related claims,
the Company’s approach to accounting
for the asbestos claims against its US
subsidiaries is to provide for those costs
of resolution which are both probable
and reliably estimable. The costs of
resolving possible claims are disclosed
as contingent liabilities. At present,
based on detailed analysis and the
assumptions contained in note 21 of 
the Notes to the accounts, the provision
for those costs which are both probable
and estimable equates to approximately
eight years of gross cost, assuming a
cost level of $60m per annum. Whilst
further claims are likely to be resolved
beyond this eight year period, the
associated costs of resolution cannot
be reliably estimated and hence no
provision has been made to cover these
possible liabilities. Factors which could
cause actual results to differ from these
estimates and expectations include: 
(i) adverse trends in the ultimate number
of asbestos claims filed against the
Company’s US subsidiaries; (ii)
increases in the cost of resolving current
and future asbestos claims as a result 
of adverse trends relating to settlement
costs, dismissal rates, legal fees and/or
judgment sizes; (iii) decreases in the
amount of insurance available to cover
asbestos claims as a result of adverse
changes in the interpretation of
insurance policies or the insolvency 
of insurers; (iv) the emergence of new
trends or legal theories that enlarge 
the scope of potential claimants; 
(v) the impact of bankruptcies of other
companies whose share of liability may
be imposed on the Company’s US
subsidiaries under certain state liability
laws; (vi) the unpredictable aspects of
the US litigation process; (vii) adverse
changes in the mix of asbestos-related
diseases with respect to which asbestos
claims are made against the Company’s
US subsidiaries; and (viii) potential
legislative changes. In light of such
factors, the liability of the Company’s 
US subsidiaries for resolving asbestos
claims may be materially different from
current estimates and the impact of
such claims might have a material
adverse effect on the Company’s
consolidated financial condition, results
of operations and cash flow. However,
assuming that current trends continue,
the Company does not expect that the
liability and costs associated with these
asbestos claims will have such a material
adverse effect and, even assuming a
material deterioration in current trends,
based on the evidence available to it, 
the Company does not expect that such
claims would impact the ability of the
Company to continue as a going concern.
Hanson’s insurance may be insufficient
to cover its obligations related to
Koppers’ environmental liabilities.
Koppers’ environmental clean-up/
remediation obligations and related
costs refer primarily to certain former 
US discontinued chemical and related
operations carried on by the Koppers
company. Members of the group remain
contractually and statutorily liable 
for certain environmental clean-up/
remediation costs relating to these
discontinued operations. The Company
considers current insurance cover to 
be sufficient to meet the related future
costs of this liability, on the basis of its
estimates and assumptions regarding
future developments. Factors which
could cause actual costs to differ from
these estimates and assumptions
Principal risks and uncertainties
47
†
Continuing operations include: (i) unknown adverse conditions
arising at sites; (ii) third party claims 
in excess of estimates; (iii) changes to
regulatory requirements; (iv) changes 
in remediation techniques and; (v) any
other significant variations to
assumptions made in support of these
estimates. Should the current insurance
cover be insufficient to meet the related
future costs this could have a material
impact on our financial condition, results
of operations and cash flow.
As a consequence of its significant
present and former activities in the USA,
the group is subject to litigation claims
arising out of both former businesses
and activities, (in addition to those
relating to asbestos and Koppers’
environmental liabilities referred to
above) as well as its existing operations.
Former and existing subsidiaries have
engaged in businesses and activities,
unrelated to the business and activities
presently carried on by our group, 
which give rise to bodily injury and
property damage claims concerning
environmental and health issues. In
particular, claims and lawsuits have
been filed against our US subsidiaries,
either directly or as a result of indemnity
obligations, relating to products
incorporating coal by-products and
other chemicals, in particular for the
wood treating industry. With respect to
those claims involving coal by-products
and other chemicals, the US subsidiary
involved has not entered into a material
settlement or been subject to a material
adverse judgment since the demergers
as described below. 
In addition, existing operations suffer,
from litigation claims which may be
uninsured or fall within deductible levels.
In many cases the relevant subsidiary
believes it has good defences against
these claims. Nevertheless, in light of
the uncertainties involved in litigation
and in particular in the USA, where 
there is the added potential for punitive
damages, our subsidiary may be
required to participate in settlements or
be subject to judgments in future, which
may not be covered by insurance and
consequently have a material impact 
on our financial condition, results of
operations and cash flow.
Demergers
Four companies into which former
Hanson businesses were demerged
agreed in connection with their
respective demergers to indemnify 
us against liabilities of the businesses
transferred to those companies. We
have not incurred any liability in respect
of any claim that related to the above
mentioned businesses; any such liability
being borne by the relevant demerged
company. The Energy Group plc, one of
the demerged companies, was acquired
by TXU Corp. in 1998. In November
2002, TXU Corp. announced that
several of TXU Corp. ’s UK subsidiaries
had been placed under the
administrative process in the UK (similar
to bankruptcy proceedings in the USA),
including The Energy Group. The Energy
Group is, therefore, unlikely to be able 
to fulfil its indemnification obligations 
to Hanson if it were required to do so.
We are, however, not aware of any claim
against us or our subsidiaries that would
give rise to an indemnity obligation on
the part of The Energy Group.

In 2005, recognising that the
improvement in group statistics was
probably optimised based on traditional
training and evaluating methods, we
increased our focus on identifying and
eliminating unsafe behaviour. This is
being implemented through programmes
of training and performance monitoring
against targets. We believe that, working
interdependently with our employees,
we can change their perception and
acceptance of risk. The message we
have used is that no job is so important
for safety to be compromised. 
A key tool, supported and led by Alan
Murray, Chief Executive and the director
responsible for health and safety, and
the divisional Chief Executives/Managing
Directors, is a sustained exercise in
‘safety observations’ by managers. We
believe that we will only communicate
the importance of creating a safe
working environment with visibility on
site of senior managers and Directors.
In a safety observation, a manager
observes employees working and then
discusses the safety aspects of their
work. In this conversation the manager:
– seeks the employee’s comments on
safety in his/her own workplace and
his/her ideas on how to improve this
– praises the employee for safe working
practices which have been observed
– ensures that any unsafe acts are
discussed and action taken to prevent
their reoccurrence.
Data is collected on the number, type
and frequency of accidents and of the
amount of time which is lost as a result
of workplace accidents. We analyse this
information to identify where we need to
focus particular attention and to assess
the effectiveness of our management of
health and safety. 
The progress of safety performance
throughout our businesses worldwide 
is tracked and reported quarterly to the
Board using standard measures. 
We recognise the need to act in a
responsible manner and to demonstrate
our corporate responsibility in many
ways: the way in which we trade, develop
new products and manage and restore
our sites and in the way we treat and
respect our employees, neighbours and
customers. Corporate responsibility is
integral to good business management. 
Health and safety
We continue to consider health 
and safety to be a top priority and 
a fundamental element of being a
successful business. 
We are committed to achieving 
the highest reasonably practicable
standards of health, safety and welfare
for our employees, contractors,
customers and visitors. 
Hanson companies around the world
actively engage with government
agencies, trade associations and other
similar bodies to promote the benefits of
a safe and healthy working environment
and develop best practice.
In 2006, the Board will formally endorse
its approach to health and safety with a
group policy statement. Our divisional
Chief Executives/Managing Directors
will remain responsible for establishing
formal policies and procedures, for
ensuring that arrangements are made
for the fulfilment of those policies and 
for monitoring their implementation and
effectiveness.
The divisional Chief Executives/
Managing Directors are supported 
by a network of safety professionals,
who share information and best practice
to ensure that lessons learnt from
accident investigations are applied
across the group.
To prevent injuries and other incidents
from occurring we: 
– train our employees to work safely
and to eliminate the causes of
unsafe behaviour
– seek to provide safe systems of
work and encourage a safety culture
– continually strive for improved safety
performance
– look to adopt best practice and to
commit to industry improvement
initiatives and targets.
Managing the environment is an integral part 
of our business strategy.  Corporate responsibility continued

Hanson uses the following indicators 
to provide a consistent measure of 
its performance. According to best
international practice the frequency
measures are per 200,000 hours worked:
– Lost time incidence rate: this is the
frequency rate of injuries resulting 
in an employee being absent for 
one or more shifts. 
– Lost day incidence rate: this is 
the frequency rate for days lost 
as a result of accidents.
The overall safety statistics for the 
group showed continued improvement in
2005 for the sixth consecutive year since
consolidated records began in 2000.
There were no employee work-related
fatalities and, although the incidence 
of lost time injuries remained the same 
as for 2004, the number of lost work
days (shifts) per lost time incident was
reduced slightly (see page 12 for data).
Over the past six years, the incidence of
lost time injuries has reduced by 37%
and the number of lost work days per 
lost time incident has reduced by 55%.
Regrettably, however, there was one
contractor fatality during the year.
We encourage people to become safety
representatives from all areas of our
business. They receive training to assist
them in their roles. We were delighted
that Colin Evans, a safety representative
from Penderyn Quarry in South Wales,
received a well deserved MBE for his
contribution to health and safety in the
quarrying industry.
The environment
Hanson understands that its reputation
for managing environmental issues
carefully and managing the impact 
of our activities on the environment is a
valuable asset. As such, it is an integral
part of our business strategy. 
We seek continual improvement 
in environmental performance and
endeavour to make a positive contribution
to society through our products and 
our land and marine management
programmes.
Significant environmental issues –
legislative, risk, performance, product
development and opportunities – 
are reported quarterly to the Board. 
Our environmental policy provides the
framework for setting and reviewing
environmental objectives and targets. 
It is applied as the minimum standard
across our business. Where businesses
identify a need for additional, more
stretching requirements, they actively
build upon this policy. 
Our environmental management in 
the UK was developed through the
publication, on August 30, 2005, 
of the Hanson UK biodiversity and
geodiversity action plan. This was
devised in consultation with English
Nature and the Countryside Council 
for Wales. 
Additionally, under an earlier
memorandum of understanding, 
Hanson committed to work to improve
standards of conservation management
in its quarries with the aim of maintaining
and enhancing its sites of special
scientific interest (SSSIs). We are
currently responsible for 60 such sites 
in the UK. Our bio and geo-diversity
plans are a development of this work.
Community relations
Hanson operates internationally but is
focused locally. Our products, because
of a high weight to value ratio, do not
travel far, so our businesses are closely
connected with the communities in
which they are located. Many of our sites
are in rural areas where, often as the
largest commercial enterprise within the
area, we contribute to the local economy,
through the goods and services we
purchase and the people we employ. 
Local management teams have 
overall responsibility for engagement
with the communities in which we are
located. This ensures that we respond
appropriately to the differing needs and
interests of communities. 
We closely identify with our
neighbourhoods and our staff often
initiate regular meetings with local
people. These meetings provide a forum
for discussing and resolving any issues
and concerns at an early stage. 
We encourage organised school groups
to visit our sites and also hold open days
for members of the community, including
the families of our employees. 
We have developed educational 
packs and other supporting material 
for teachers to use in conjunction 
with a visit to one of our quarries. Corporate responsibility
51
The workplace
Employees, franchise workers and
contractors are all key players in
delivering our business performance 
in a safe, efficient and socially
responsible manner.
We therefore ensure that they
understand their part in achieving 
the objectives of the business. 
To ensure we have an ongoing pipeline
of managers capable of taking on larger
job roles, attention is given to the
development of employees. 
Communications, training and 
the development of our business
management capability through basic
skills/vocational training, in-house
management development and
leadership programmes ensures we have
a committed and focused work force.
We have a quarterly employee magazine
called Foundation which is available to
each employee. This provides commercial
and operational news; information about
our local communities and our health,
safety and environmental management
as well as news about our employees’
achievements. 
We also use a range of meetings to
encourage our employees to contribute
to improving our business. These include
regular safety groups; works councils;
employer/union work parties and Euro
forum meetings are also held seeking
input and comment from our UK and
Continental European employees.
Additional meetings are held locally 
and regionally to inform employees of
company performance and how they
can improve this.
Employee surveys have also been
undertaken during the year, covering
areas such as communication, safety,
job clarity and satisfaction, customer
service and the understanding of the
Hanson guiding principles. Feedback
was given to the employees and 
follow-up actions were agreed. It is 
our intention to undertake further
employee surveys during 2006.
Additionally, in our aim to create 
a better and safer workplace, an
anonymous incident reporting system,
MySafeWorkplace, provides employees
with a confidential, easy-to-use tool 
to report workplace incidents. All
concerns, covering a wide range of
issues that can be reported, are brought
to the attention of the Head of Internal
Audit and handled with appropriate
concern and attention according to
Company policies. 
Recruiting the right people into the
organisation is an important part of
development management. During
2005, the Hanson careers website was
developed for e-recruitment as a further
means of attracting people to work 
for Hanson.
Group employment policies include
those which cover role and goal clarity,
performance management, employee
development, succession planning and
recruitment. Hanson requires each of the
divisions to have an Equal Opportunities
Policy which complies with group
expectations and local legislation. 
Full consideration is given to applications
for employment, the continuing
employment, training and career
development of disabled persons.
Remuneration and terms and conditions
of employment are maintained at a
competitive level in the areas in which
we operate. The Company operates
with low levels of employee turnover.
Hanson recognises the value of diversity.
Performance management based on our
people having a clear understanding of
their roles and goals has also been a key
area of focus for the year.
Charitable donations and sponsorship
We get involved in fundraising and
sponsorship and make donations and
gifts in kind to the communities in which
we operate. 
Our products are such an essential 
part of our modern lives that we are
often asked to support local projects by
donating materials. We have a general
policy of supporting community projects
in this way, particularly close to our
operations.
Along with many people around the
world, we were shocked and dismayed
by the impact of Hurricane Katrina on
New Orleans where a number of our
employees were affected. Hanson
donated $100,000 to the Red Cross 
to help support those affected by the
catastrophe. In addition, employees of
the Company and suppliers established
a relief fund for Hanson employees
affected by the hurricane, with the
Company matching donations made.

124 3 956 7 8 The Directors submit their report together with the
consolidated accounts of Hanson PLC and its
subsidiary undertakings for the year ended December
31, 2005.
Incorporation and name
The Company (“New Hanson”) was incorporated in
England and Wales (No. 4626078) on December 31,
2002 as Broadcast Sales Limited, changed its name to
Hanson Building Materials Limited on June 4, 2003, 
re-registered as a public limited company, Hanson
Building Materials PLC, on July 10, 2003 and changed
its name to Hanson PLC on October 14, 2003. The
Company, formerly known as Hanson PLC (“Old
Hanson”), re-registered as a private limited company
and changed its name to Hanson Building Materials
Limited on October 14, 2003.
Following shareholder approval on September 19, 2003
and Court sanction on October 13, 2003 and October
20, 2003, a scheme of arrangement (the “Scheme”) 
and share capital reduction were implemented whereby
shareholders in Old Hanson received, in substitution for
each ordinary share of £2, one ordinary share of 10p in
New Hanson. The Scheme became effective on October
14, 2003 and the reduction in nominal value of the new
ordinary shares to 10p each became effective on
October 21, 2003.
The Scheme and the reduction in nominal value were
implemented in order to increase the distributable
reserves available to the Company.
Results and dividends
The profit for the year was £387 .6m. 
An interim dividend of 5.85p per ordinary share was 
paid on September 16, 2005. The Directors recommend
a final dividend of 14.15p per ordinary share which will, 
if approved at the AGM, be paid on May 5, 2006, to
ordinary shareholders on the register at close of business
(London time) on April 7 , 2006. 
Dividends of £136.2m were paid during the year.

Directors’ interests
Details of the Directors’ service contracts, emoluments
and share interests at December 31, 2005, appear in
the Remuneration report on pages 61 to 67 .
Following the introduction of the Companies (Audit,
Investigations and Community Enterprise) Act 2004 
in April 2005, at the AGM held in 2005, shareholders
passed a resolution to a change in the Articles of
Association of Hanson in relation to the indemnification
of Directors. The new article expanded the circumstances
in which a Director can be indemnified by the Company.
The terms of appointment of the Directors in office at the
time of the AGM in 2005 have been changed to entitle
them to benefit from the provisions contained in the 
new article.
Report of the Directors
Report of the Directors
53 In addition to providing this indemnification and 
any other indemnification pursuant to the articles of
association, charter or by-laws of Hanson’s subsidiaries,
Hanson maintains directors’ and officers’ liability
insurance for Directors and officers of Hanson and 
its subsidiaries. 
Except for such indemnification and insurance and
except for the respective terms of service of such
Directors and officers, no Director or officer of Hanson
or any of their respective relatives or spouses either 
had an interest in any contract or transaction which 
was material to Hanson or such related party or unusual
in its nature or conditions or had any outstanding
indebtedness of a material nature owing to Hanson 
at any time during the last three years. 
Charitable and political donations
During the year, the group made worldwide charitable
donations of £309,000 (2004 – £321,000), including
£93,000 (2004 – £183,000) in the UK. As in the

creditors. The policy of Hanson companies is to agree
payment terms with their suppliers and abide by those
terms, subject to satisfactory performance by the supplier.

Ernst & Y oung LLP are the independent auditors 
of Hanson and, having expressed their willingness 
to continue in office, a resolution proposing their 
re-appointment will be submitted at the AGM. The
Auditors’ reports on the accounts are on pages 68,

Report of the Directors continued
Report of the Directors
54 The Board is accountable to shareholders for good
business governance and is committed to high
standards of corporate governance, recognising that
Hanson’s good reputation is one of the Company’s 
most valuable assets.
To maintain and enhance this reputation Hanson
requires its officers and employees to act in accordance
with the laws and customs of each country in which we
do business; be honest and act ethically; operate with
integrity; observe and respect the culture and traditions
of each country in which we operate; and not to offer,
pay or accept bribes or favours in any form whatsoever.
Within adopted business principles, divisional codes 
of conduct and supporting policies are in place.
A code of ethics for the purposes of the Sarbanes-Oxley
Act of 2002 (US) (SOX), which applies to Hanson as a
company listed on the NYSE, covering Hanson’s Chief
Executive, Finance Director, Legal Director, Divisional
Chief Executives and other identifiable persons in the
group, including those performing senior accounting
and controller functions, is in place. This code is
available on request from the Company Secretary 
or on Hanson’s website.
The way in which Hanson applies the principles set 
out in the Combined Code on Corporate Governance
issued by the Financial Reporting Council in July 2003
(the “Code”) is described within this Corporate
governance section and in the Remuneration report. The
Board considers that Hanson has been in full compliance
with the Code throughout the year under review.
As well as being subject to UK legislation and practice
Hanson, as a company listed on the NYSE, is subject 
to the listing requirements of the NYSE and the rules of
the SEC. Compliance with the provisions of SOX, as it
applies to foreign issuers, is continually monitored.
Whilst the Directors believe that the group’s corporate
governance policies are robust, changes have been and
will continue to be made to ensure compliance with the
rules that are in place at any point in time. Hanson
follows UK corporate governance practice, which does
not differ significantly from the NYSE corporate
governance standards, except that the Nominations
Committee is required to be comprised of a majority,
rather than entirely, of independent directors and there 
is no requirement in the UK for a comprehensive code 
of business conduct and ethics.
The Board of Directors
The Board currently comprises the Chairman, the 
Chief Executive, two other Executive Directors and five
Non-executive Directors. 
There is a clear separation of the roles of the Chairman
and Chief Executive. The division of responsibilities
between Chairman and the Chief Executive is set out in
writing and has been agreed by the Board. As Chairman,
M W Welton has the responsibility for the running of the
Board and for ensuring that all Directors are fully informed
of matters relevant to their roles. As Chief Executive, 
A J Murray has responsibility for implementing the
strategy agreed by the Board and for managing the group.
During the year and following his appointment as
Chairman, M W Welton was appointed to the advisory
board of Montrose Associates. His other commitments
did not change. 
All of the Non-executive Directors are, in the opinion 
of the Board, considered to be independent of
management and free from any business or other
relationships which affect their ability to exercise
independent judgement. J W Leng is the Senior
Independent Director.
The Board considers that the current Non-executive
Directors bring a wide range of business and financial
experience required for the successful direction of
Hanson as an international force in the heavy building
materials industry and provide a solid foundation for
good corporate governance, ensuring that no individual
or group dominates the Board’s decision making.
Through the Nominations Committee, the Board
ensures that plans are in place for the succession 
of Executive and Non-executive Directors.
The Chairman and the Company Secretary work closely
together in planning the annual programme and agendas
for meetings. During the year, there were six Board and
strategy meetings held. The attendance records of 
individual Directors is set out below:
Attendance
M W Welton 6/6
A J Murray 6/6
G Dransfield 6/6
J C Nicholls 6/6
W F Blount 5/6
C J Brady 4/4
W S H Laidlaw 5/6

The Rt Hon. Lord Baker of Dorking (retired April 20, 2005) 1/1
S L Keswick (retired April 20, 2005) –/1
There are clearly occasions when circumstances 
arise which prevent Directors from attending meetings. 
It is the usual practice in these circumstances for the
Director concerned to review the Board papers with the
Chairman and convey any views.
All Directors then in office attended the AGM in 2005.
Corporate governance
Corporate governance
55 The Board manages overall control of the Company’s
affairs with reference to the schedule of matters
reserved for its authorisation and approval, review and
responsibility. This schedule was reviewed and updated
during the year.
Matters reserved for authorisation and approval include
the Company’s objectives and long-term strategy, 
the annual operating budget, financial statements 
and significant changes in accounting policy, dividend
recommendations, treasury activities, major acquisitions
and disposals, major capital projects or expenditure,
appointment and removal of Directors and the Company
Secretary, risk management policies and major changes
in the group’s pension arrangements.
Matters for which the Board has responsibility include
compliance with the group’s corporate responsibility
policies, including environmental and health and safety
and, as set out below, the group’s system of internal control.
Matters which the Board reviews include quarterly
results and performance against budget, the group’s
management resource planning and development,
charitable donations, the Company’s corporate
governance arrangements and the effectiveness of the
group’s system of internal control, as set out below.
All Directors are equally accountable for the proper
stewardship of the Company’s affairs. 
The Non-executive Directors have a particular
responsibility for ensuring that the business strategies
proposed are fully discussed and critically reviewed.
This enables the Directors to act in the best long-term
interest of shareholders, whilst taking account of the
interests of employees, customers, suppliers and the
communities in which the businesses operate.
The Non-executive Directors also oversee the
operational performance of the whole group. T o do 
this they have full and timely access to all relevant
information, with updates also provided on governance
and regulatory matters affecting the Company. In
addition, senior executives below Board level are invited,
as appropriate, to Board and strategy meetings to make
presentations on their areas of responsibility.
As part of the initial induction process for those 
Non-executive Directors newly appointed, documents
describing the Company and its activities are provided.
An element of the induction focuses on relevant
corporate responsibility matters and management
resource planning and development. Site visits are
arranged, with all Directors provided with the
opportunity and encouragement for training to ensure
they are kept up-to-date on relevant new legislation and
best practice and changing commercial and other risks. 
In order to fulfil their duties, procedures are in place 
for Directors to seek both independent advice and the
advice and services of the Company Secretary who is
responsible for advising the Board, through the
Chairman, on all governance matters.
During the year, an evaluation of the Board’s
effectiveness, including the effectiveness of Committees
of the Board, was undertaken by the Chairman by way of
a written questionnaire to, and individual meetings with,
all Directors. A report was prepared for the Board by the
Chairman. The results of the evaluation showed a high
level of satisfaction that the Board and its Committees
were operating effectively. The Board’s focus was on
identifying improvements in such areas as the process
for developing strategy; the balance between strategic
and operational issues at meetings; the process for
reporting Committee work to the Board and inter-meeting
information to the Non-executive Directors. Identified
improvements will be introduced in 2006.
The Board plans to conduct evaluations on an annual
basis and may use alternative approaches in future years.
As part of the evaluation process, the Chairman
considered the performance, including time
commitments, of each individual Non-executive Director
and concluded that the performance of each continues
to be effective.
Also during the year and in the absence of the 
Chairman, the Non-executive Directors, led by J W Leng,
conducted a review of and discussed the performance
of the Chairman taking into account the views of the
Executive Directors. The conclusion reached, which 
was fed back to the Chairman by J W Leng, was that the
Chairman’s performance was effective. Similarly, during
the year, the Chairman met separately with the Non-
executive Directors to consider the performance of the
Chief Executive in the discharge of his duties. It was
concluded that the performance of the Chief Executive
continues to be effective.
The Non-executive Directors fulfil a key role in corporate
accountability. The remits and membership of the
Remuneration, the Nominations and the Audit
Committees of the Board are set out below. 
The terms of reference of the Committees are 
available on request from the Company Secretary, 
who acts as secretary to all of these Committees, 
or on Hanson’s website.
Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee comprises four independent
Non-executive Directors; W S H Laidlaw (Chairman), 
W F Blount, The Baroness Noakes and C J Brady. Its
role is described in the Remuneration report.
In 2005, the annual fees for chairing the Committee and
for acting as a member were £12,500 and £5,500,
respectively. There has been no change to the fee
arrangements for 2006.

Nominations Committee
The Nominations Committee consists of M W Welton as
Chairman, A J Murray and the independent Non-executive
Directors.
The Committee’s terms of reference include the review
of the structure, size and composition of the Board, with
recommendations to the Board on any changes, and
planning for the orderly succession of Executive and
Non-executive Directors.
There were no fees payable for chairing or acting as 
a member of the Committee in 2005. There has been 
no change to the fee arrangements for 2006.
During the year, on behalf of the Board, the Committee
undertook a search for the appointment of a new Non-
executive Director. Having considered the balance of
skills and experience on the Board, a candidate profile
for the search was agreed. The Committee then
appointed an external search consultancy and met with
candidates prior to making a recommendation to the
Board, which resulted in the appointment of C J Brady
as a Non-executive Director of the Company on August
1, 2005. It is anticipated that, for the appointment of
further Non-executive Directors, a similar procedure will
be adopted.
During the year the Committee met once formally in full,
and on a number of other occasions, principally in the
search for a new Non-executive Director and in order to
make recommendations to the Board on membership 
of the Remuneration Committee.
Following appointment by the Board, new Directors
must submit themselves for election by the shareholders
at the AGM following their appointment. Thereafter,
subject to the Articles of Association in relation 
to the re-election of Directors, all Directors are subject 
to re-election every three years. Recommendations to
shareholders on the re-appointment of the Directors is
not automatic and is subject to consideration by the
Committee, prior to approval by the Board.
Audit Committee
The Audit Committee comprises three independent
Non-executive Directors; The Baroness Noakes
(Chairman), W S H Laidlaw and J W Leng.
In 2005, the annual fees for chairing the Audit Committee
and for acting as a member of the Committee were
£20,000 and £5,500, respectively. There has been 
no change to the fee arrangements for 2006.
Regular attendees at Committee meetings, at the
invitation of the Committee, include the Chairman, the
Finance Director, the Head of Internal Audit, the Group
Financial Controller, the Group Chief Accountant and
representatives from the external auditors.
The Committee’s duties include:
– review of the effectiveness of systems for internal
financial control, financial reporting and risk
management
– the review and monitoring of the Company’s
financial statements, accounting policies, financial
and other reporting procedures
– the review of the Company’s statement on internal
control prior to endorsement by the Board
– review of the internal audit programme
– the establishment of whistleblowing procedures
– recommendations on the appointment of, and an
assessment of the independence and objectivity of,
the auditors
– pre-approval of audit, review and attest services and
permitted non-audit services; and
– ensuring the objectivity and independence of the
auditors is maintained.
The Committee meets at least four times a year. During
the year the Committee met five times, which all of the
then current Committee members attended, other than on
one occasion when W S H Laidlaw was unable to attend.
The Board considers that each of the members of the
Committee has experience of corporate financial matters.
The Baroness Noakes, who is a Chartered Accountant,
is considered by the Board to have recent and relevant
financial experience and is also identified as the Audit
Committee financial expert for the purposes of SOX.
The Committee discharges its responsibilities through 
a series of Committee meetings throughout the year 
at which detailed reports are presented for review. 
The Committee commissions reports either from the
external auditors, the Head of Internal Audit or Company
management, after consideration of the Company’s
major risks or in response to developing issues. The
Committee meets privately with the external auditors and
the Head of Internal Audit as appropriate. It has authority
to seek any information it requires from any employee,
authority to obtain outside legal or other independent
professional advice on any matter within its terms of
reference and to secure the attendance of outsiders 
with relevant experience and expertise if it considers it
necessary. There were no occasions during the year
when it considered the attendance of such outsiders
was necessary. Corporate governance continued

During the year, the Committee’s meetings considered
or addressed, as appropriate, the following principal
matters:
– the interim and full year financial results, including
monitoring their integrity, prior to consideration by
the Board 
– the annual internal audit plan and its resourcing
– the auditors’ interim and full year reports
– the auditors’ report to management
– compliance with the group’s code of ethics
– the monitoring of the group’s International Financial
Reporting Standards conversion exercise
–changes to the group’s accounting policies
– the overseeing of the group’s SOX compliance work
– the overseeing of the whistleblowing programme
– minutes of the Risk Committee, which monitors and
reviews significant financial and non-financial risk, as
well as reviewing and reporting on the effectiveness
of the group’s system of internal control
– the proposed introduction by UK government 
of an Operating and Financial Review, subsequently
withdrawn
– the scope and cost of the external audit
– any non-audit work carried out by the auditors; and 
– an evaluation of the effectiveness of the auditors,
which included feedback from management on the
quality of the audit and the working relationship
between management and the auditors, and
consideration of their reappointment.
The Committee also undertook a review of its terms of
reference and its own work and effectiveness, and
reported back to the Board.
Having overseen the establishment of a groupwide
whistleblowing programme, MySafeWorkplace, 
through which employees may in confidence raise
concerns about possible wrongdoing in financial
reporting or other matters, the Committee received
reports during the year to ensure proportionate and
independent investigation of such matters with
appropriate follow-up action.
Additionally, to safeguard the objectivity and
independence of the auditors and to ensure that the
independence of the audit work undertaken by the
auditors is not compromised, the Committee considered
the auditors’ own assessment of independence and
compliance with relevant professional and regulatory
requirements. The views of management were also 
taken into consideration.
The Committee also has a policy for the provision 
of non-audit services by the auditors. The policy defines
services which can be provided by the auditors and
requires all non-audit services to be approved in
advance by the Committee, which has delegated this
task to the Head of Internal Audit. The approval process
requires full disclosure of the objective and the scope of
services to be performed in addition to the fee structure.
The Committee reviews all approved services and level
of expenditure at subsequent meetings. The auditors are
permitted to perform non-audit services only if the scope
of work is within the terms of the policy and there is a
business benefit to the group in these services being
performed by them rather then an alternative supplier. 
The Committee considered that the independence and
objectivity of the auditors was unimpaired and that Ernst
& Y oung LLP were effective in conducting the audit and
work on SOX compliance during the year.
Internal control 
The Board recognises that it is responsible for the
group’s system of internal control and for reviewing its
effectiveness. The Code requires the Board to review
the effectiveness of the system of internal control,
including financial, operational, compliance and risk
management, at least annually. In addition, Internal
Control: Guidance for Directors on the Combined Code
was published in September 1999, to provide guidance
to Directors in respect of this requirement. Revised
guidance for Directors, which comes into effect for
financial years commencing on or after January 1, 2006,
has been issued and the Company will take this
guidance into consideration during 2006.
The Board confirms that procedures, which accord with
the original guidance, have been in place for the year to
December 31, 2005 and up to the date of approval of
the Annual Report and Form 20-F by the Board. These
procedures ensure that the Board is aware of the key
risks facing the group and that the system of internal
control is regularly reviewed for effectiveness and
adequacy. Such a system can only provide reasonable
and not absolute assurance against material misstatement
or loss, as it is designed to manage rather than eliminate
the risk of failure to achieve business objectives. In
seeking to achieve these objectives, many of which are
already features of the existing processes and procedures
within the Company, the Board has specifically instituted
the following processes, which have been in effect
throughout the reporting period and up to the date 
of approval of the Annual Report and Form 20-F by 
the Board.
Policies
–A planning framework which incorporates a four year
plan approved by the Board, with objectives for each
business unit.
–A mechanism for reporting weaknesses in internal
control systems and for monitoring corrective action.
Processes
– Appointment of experienced and professional staff,
both by recruitment and promotion, of the necessary
calibre to fulfil their allotted responsibilities.
–A comprehensive system of financial reporting to the
Board, based on an annual budget with monthly
reports against actual results, analysis of variances,
scrutiny of key performance indicators and regular
re-forecasting.
–Formal business risk reviews performed by
management which evaluate the potential financial
and non-financial impacts of identified risks and
possible new risk areas, set control, mitigation and
monitoring procedures and review actual
occurrences identifying lessons to be learnt.
– Regular treasury reports to the Board which analyse
the funding requirements of each class of assets,
track the generation and use of capital and the volume
of liquidity, measure the group’s exposure to interest
and exchange rate movements and record the level of Corporate governance
59
compliance with the group’s funding objectives.
–Well-defined procedures governing the appraisal
and approval of investments, including detailed
investment and divestment approval procedures
incorporating appropriate levels of authority and
regular post investment reviews.
Verification
– An internal audit function within the business
operations which undertakes periodic examination
of business units and processes and recommends
improvements in controls to management.
–The external auditors who are engaged to express
an opinion on the accounts.
– An Audit Committee of the Board, consisting of
Non-executive Directors, which considers
significant control matters and receives reports on
internal controls from both the internal and external
auditors on a regular basis.
–A Risk Committee of the Board, consisting of the
Chief Executive, Finance Director, Legal Director
and other senior executives, which monitors and
reviews significant financial and non-financial risk.
Evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures 
The Company has a Disclosure Committee, which
includes amongst its members, the Chief Executive, the
Finance Director and the Legal Director. The Committee
monitors and reviews the group’s disclosure controls
and procedures to ensure these are satisfactory for 
the purpose. The review includes the evaluation of the
effectiveness as at December 31, 2005 of these
disclosure controls and procedures to permit the
signing of the certifications required by the Chief
Executive and the Finance Director in accordance with
the requirements of section 302 of the US Sarbanes-
Oxley Act of 2002. Based on this evaluation, the Chief
Executive and the Finance Director concluded that the
disclosure controls and procedures are effective in all
material respects to ensure that material information
relating to the group would be made known to them by
others within the group.
Management’s annual report on internal control over
financial reporting 
In accordance with the requirements of section 404 
of the US Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, the following
report is provided by management in respect of the
Company’s internal control over financial reporting (as
defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the US
Securities Exchange Act of 1934): 
– Hanson’s management is responsible for
establishing and maintaining adequate internal
control over financial reporting for the group.
– Hanson’s management has used the Committee of
Sponsoring Organisations of the Treadway
Commission (“COSO”) framework to evaluate the
effectiveness of our internal control over financial
reporting. Management believes that the COSO
framework is a suitable framework for its evaluation
of our internal control over financial reporting
because it is free from bias, permits reasonably
consistent qualitative and quantitative
measurements of our internal controls, is sufficiently
complete so that those relevant factors that would
alter a conclusion about the effectiveness of our
internal controls are not omitted and is relevant to an
evaluation of internal control over financial reporting.
– Management has assessed the effectiveness of our
internal control over financial reporting, as at
December 31, 2005, and has concluded that such
internal control over financial reporting is effective. 
– Ernst & Y oung LLP , which has audited the
consolidated financial statements of the group for
the year ended December 31, 2005, has also audited
management’s assessment of the effectiveness of
internal control over financial reporting under
Auditing Standard No. 2 of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States). See
the Auditors’ report on page 69.
Changes in internal control over financial reporting 
During the period management has continued to
improve its control environment to respond, in particular,
to changes in accounting practice (IFRS) and to reflect
enhancements to information systems and procedures.
There have been no changes in the group’s internal
controls or in other factors during the period that have
materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially
affect, the group’s internal control over financial reporting.
Internal Audit
Each major operating division has internal audit
capability and these are co-ordinated centrally by the
Head of Internal Audit under the guidance of the Audit
Committee. The Audit Committee reviews internal audit
reports and considers the overall effectiveness of the
function. Priority in 2005 has once again been on
financial statement risks identified through existing risk
management procedures and through the assessment
of internal control over financial reporting, required by
SOX. The Board is once again pleased that this has
resulted in Hanson being able to report fully under
section 404 of SOX this year. Planning for 2006 will,
however, continue to broaden the agenda and expand
the scope of internal audit. A greater emphasis on
operational risks, as the SOX requirements become
further embedded in the organisation, will help to
promote the overall effectiveness of the group’s risk
management and internal controls. Corporate governance continued

Shareholder communications
Hanson values its dialogue with both institutional and
private investors and, based on publicly available
information, constructive two-way communication with
fund managers, institutional investors and analysts is
promoted and encouraged. 
The views of major shareholders are reported to the
Board, with independent surveys undertaken by the
Company’s brokers on specific issues of relevance 
to the Company. 
Following his appointment as Chairman, M W Welton
met with the Company’s major shareholders.
Arrangements are also in place for the Senior
Independent Director and other Non-executive Directors
to meet with major shareholders, if they so request. 
Additional forms of communication include
presentations of the interim and annual results, and 
of the trading statements.
The Hanson website at www.hanson.biz provides access
to information on the Company and its businesses.
Further details of the website can be found in the Investor
information section. It is not intended for the website
address to be an active link or to otherwise incorporate
the contents of the website into this document.
At the AGM (see page 53 for details), the Chief
Executive will present a review of the results and current
business activity. Shareholders are invited to ask
questions on items of business put before the meeting
and will have the opportunity to vote separately on each
resolution. The Chairman will indicate the level of proxy
votes lodged in respect of each resolution following
each vote on a show of hands and details of those
abstaining from voting will also be disclosed. As for 
the prior year, this information will also be posted on 
the Hanson website after the meeting. Following the
meeting, the Directors will be available to meet with
shareholders.
Going concern
The Directors confirm that, after meeting appropriate
enquiries, they have a reasonable expectation that
Hanson has adequate resources to continue in
operational existence for the foreseeable future.
Accordingly, they continue to adopt the going concern
basis in preparing the accounts.
Directors’ responsibilities for the accounts
Company law requires the Directors to prepare
accounts for each financial year which give a true and
fair view of the state of affairs of the Company and of the
group and of the profit or loss of the group for that year.
In preparing these accounts, the Directors consider that
they have: selected suitable accounting policies, and
applied them consistently; made judgements and
estimates that are reasonable and prudent; and followed
applicable international accounting standards.
The Directors are responsible for ensuring that the
group keeps proper accounting records which disclose
with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial
position of the group and enable them to ensure that the
accounts comply with the Companies Act 1985. They
are responsible for taking reasonable steps to safeguard
the assets of the group and to prevent and detect fraud
and other irregularities.
A copy of the Annual Report and Form 20-F of the
Company is placed on the Company’s website
www.hanson.biz. The Directors are responsible for 
the maintenance and integrity of statutory and audited
information on the Company’s website. Information
published on the internet is accessible in many countries
with different legal requirements. Legislation in the UK
governing the preparation and dissemination of
accounts may differ from legislation in other
jurisdictions.

Remuneration Committee membership and terms of reference
The Remuneration Committee (the “Committee”) is comprised exclusively of Independent Non-executive 
Directors and its members are: W S H Laidlaw (Chairman), W F Blount, The Baroness Noakes DBE and C J Brady.
WSH Laidlaw was appointed to the Committee as Chairman on May 11, 2005, replacing The Rt Hon. Lord Baker
of Dorking, and C J Brady was appointed as a member on November 16, 2005.
The role of the Committee is to consider and make recommendations on the framework of executive remuneration
(the “policy”) for approval by the Board. In accordance with the policy, the Committee will consider, recommend as
appropriate and approve the conditions of service of the Chairman, the Executive Directors and the Company
Secretary, including the duration of any service agreements, and the emoluments and other benefits payable under
such agreements, including pension entitlements and participation in incentive arrangements. The Committee also
recommends and monitors the level and structure of remuneration for senior management and oversees the
Company’s and Old Hanson’s long-term incentive plans and option schemes. 
During the year under review, other than from its independent advisor, the Committee also sought the assistance 
of the Chairman, the Chief Executive, the Company Secretary and the Head of Corporate Human Resources on
matters relating to remuneration. 
There were three formal meetings held by the Committee during the year and all the then members attended each
meeting, other than C J Brady, who, having been appointed to the Committee on November 16, 2005 was unable
to change his commitments to attend the Committee meeting on November 22, 2005. The Committee also dealt
with other matters under its terms of reference by written correspondence. The Chairman, Chief Executive and the
Company Secretary were present at all the meetings of the Committee but each were respectively excluded when
their own performance and remuneration were being discussed. 
The Committee also undertook a review of its terms of reference and its own work and effectiveness, and reported
back to the Board.
Committee members receive fees as Non-executive Directors, including a fee for acting as a Committee member 
as outlined in the Corporate governance section on page 56, but do not receive any pension entitlements nor any
short- or long-term performance related incentives. No member of the Committee has any personal financial interest,
other than as a shareholder in the Company, in the matters to be decided or for the day-to-day management of 
the business. 
The fees payable to Non-executive Directors are determined by the Board as a whole within the limits set by the articles
of association and for the year ending December 31, 2005 the basic fee was £36,000. In 2006, this will be £40,000.
The Non-executive Directors do not participate in or vote on any discussion relating to their own remuneration.
The Committee has appointed Mercer Human Resource Consulting (“Mercer”) to act on behalf of the Committee 
in providing independent market information and remuneration advice on an ongoing basis. Mercer also provides
actuarial and consulting services to the Company.
Remuneration policy
Hanson operates in competitive and international markets. T o secure the long-term performance of the business 
it is essential that the Company implements an integrated system of remuneration which rewards sustained high
performance well enough to attract and retain high-performing executives and directors. T o ensure that its
remuneration rates are competitive, whilst not being excessive, the Committee keeps remuneration under regular
review in light of emerging best practice.
The remuneration policy is designed to provide packages, which take account of individual performance:
i) in the knowledge of what comparable, in terms of size and complexity, UK and international companies are paying;
ii) in the context of packages offered throughout the Hanson group; and
iii) to include short- and long-term performance related elements, potentially a significant portion of total rewards,
to motivate the highest performance and to align the interests of the Executive Directors and shareholders.
As shareholder approval for conditional awards to be made under the Company’s long-term incentive arrangements
expires in 2006, the Company undertook a review in 2005 of its long-term incentive arrangements and proposals
on these new arrangements will be submitted to shareholders at the forthcoming AGM. Details of the proposed
new arrangements are outlined in a separate letter to shareholders.
Share incentives are considered to be an important part of the incentive policy for Executive Directors. 
A shareholding requirement has been introduced for the Executive Directors. For the Chief Executive this will be 
to hold shares to the value of two times salary and for the other Executive Directors to the value of one times salary.
For any new Chief Executive or Executive Director, the expectation would be that the shareholding requirement
would be achieved within five years of the individual becoming a Director. The current Chief Executive and other
Executive Directors already satisfy these shareholding requirements. Remuneration report continued
Remuneration report

Basic salary
In setting the basic salary for each Executive Director, the Committee reviews relevant market data and considers
the Director’s experience, performance and responsibilities. Basic salaries are generally reviewed on an annual
basis or following a significant change in responsibilities. 
Increases in basic salary of between 4-5% have been granted to the Executive Directors for the year commencing
January 1, 2006.
The Committee also determines the fee for the Chairman and undertook a full review prior to the appointment of 
M W Welton as Chairman, whose fee as Chairman is £220,000 per annum. 
Annual bonus scheme 
The annual bonus scheme for the Executive Directors and other senior executives is aligned with changes in
shareholder value through the economic value added methodology. The main principle of economic value added 
is to recognise that over time a company should generate returns in excess of its cost of capital – the return that
lenders and shareholders expect of the Company each year.
The annual bonus scheme is calibrated by reference to target levels of bonus and, for the Executive Directors and other
senior executives, works on a bonus banking arrangement whereby each year the improvement in the group’s overall
economic value added for that year determines whether there is a bonus bank addition or deduction. Following the
addition or deduction, the participant receives one-third of the accumulated bonus bank. There is neither a cap
(maximum addition into the bonus bank each year) nor a floor (maximum deduction from the bonus bank each year).
The bonus bank has two main functions; firstly it ensures that individuals do not make short-term decisions such as
deferring essential expenditure from one year to the next and receive a bonus for doing so; and secondly, the bonus
bank can act as a retention tool.
For 2005, the target level of bonus for A J Murray was 62.5% of basic salary, for J C Nicholls 50% of basic salary
and for G Dransfield 37 .5% of basic salary.
Improvement in the group’s overall economic value added for the year to December 31, 2005 determined the
bonus bank addition for the Executive Directors. The strong operating and profit performance in 2005 led to
significant improvement in the group’s economic value added and resulted in additions to the bonus bank of 118%
of basic salary for A J Murray, 95% of basic salary for J C Nicholls and 71% of basic salary for G Dransfield. 
The bonuses paid in respect of the year to December 31, 2005 to the Executive Directors were £511,680 for 
A J Murray, £276,486 for J C Nicholls and £165,994 for G Dransfield.
Performance targets under the annual bonus scheme, based on improvements in economic value added, are set 
by the Committee, after taking advice from Mercer.
Bonuses payable to Executive Directors are not pensionable.
Long T erm Incentive Plan (“L TIP”)
Executive Directors and certain senior executives and managers from the Company’s worldwide operations
participate in the L TIP . Under this plan, participants are conditionally awarded shares in the Company at nil cost 
with the proportion of those shares which may vest subject to the achievement of performance targets over a
performance period set by the Committee.
In 2005, a conditional award of shares was made to A J Murray of 150% of basic salary and to the other Executive
Directors of 100% of basic salary. The conditional awards made in 2005 are subject to performance criteria and the
Committee determined that 50% of the conditional award should be subject to the attainment of an economic value
added target and 50% to a total shareholder return (“TSR”) target. TSR is the aggregate of share price growth and
dividends paid, on the assumption that such dividends are reinvested in Hanson shares during the performance
period. The Committee selected these performance measurements as it believed they correlated clearly with the
creation of shareholder value.
For the conditional award made in 2005, the economic value added target requires an improvement in economic
value added over a period of three years based on the results for the year to December 31, 2004. For this
measurement, a linear vesting schedule applies in order that 25% of the award will vest at the minimum performance
level with the maximum award vesting only on the achievement of substantial performance improvement. A similar
economic value added target is in place for the awards made in 2003 and 2004. On attaining the minimum
economic value added improvements of £1 3.4m for the 2003 award, £1 4.0m for the 2004 award and £14.5m for
the 2005 award, 25% of the respective awards, subject to the economic value added measurement criteria, will
vest. 100% of the awards subject to this measurement will vest on the attainment of economic value added
improvements of £35.6m, £37 .2m and £38.8m for the 2003, 2004 and 2005 awards, respectively. Remuneration report
63
For the TSR measurement in 2005 (and similarly for the awards made in 2003 and 2004), the conditional awards
made will vest only if Hanson achieves a TSR over the three year performance period, from the date of the award in
March 2005, which is greater than the TSR achieved by at least 50% of the members of a comparator group of
international building materials companies at the date of the award (the “comparator group”) over the same period.
If so, 30% of the award will vest. All of the award will vest if the Company achieves a TSR over the performance
period which is greater than that achieved by 80% of the comparator group. Between these two points the award
will vest in the proportion of 2.33% of the award for each 1% improvement in the Company’s ranking.
In 2003, the comparator group consisted of 21 companies, including Hanson. These included nine UK building
materials companies in the FTSE 350 Index (Aggregate Industries, BPB, Hanson, Novar, Pilkington, RMC, Travis
Perkins, Ultraframe and Wolseley), six European building materials companies in the Euro T op 300 Index (CRH,
Dyckerhoff, Heidelberger, Holcim, Lafarge and Wienerberger), four North American businesses (Florida Rock,
Martin Marietta, T exas Industries and Vulcan) and two Australian building materials companies (Boral and CSR).
Following the demerger of Rinker Group Limited from CSR in March 2003, the performance measurement of the
comparator group for the 2003 award has been modified to substitute Rinker for CSR using the methodology of 
re-investing a notional holding of CSR shares in Rinker from April 1, 2003 onwards. In addition, the Committee
removed Novar, Aggregate Industries, RMC, BPB, Heidelberger and Dyckerhoff following changes of control or
takeover of these companies.
For the 2004 award, the comparator group consists of 15 companies, including Hanson. These include five UK
building materials companies in the FTSE 350 Index (Hanson, Pilkington, Travis Perkins, Ultraframe and Wolseley),
four European building materials companies in the Euro T op 300 Index (CRH, Holcim, Lafarge and Wienerberger),
four North American businesses (Florida Rock, Martin Marietta, T exas Industries and Vulcan) and two Australian
building materials companies (Boral and Rinker).
For the 2005 award, the comparator group consists of 16 companies, including Hanson. These include four 
UK building materials companies in the FTSE 350 Index (Hanson, Pilkington, Travis Perkins and Wolseley), five
European building materials companies in the Euro T op 300 Index (Buzzi Unicem, CRH, Holcim, Lafarge and
Wienerberger), four North American businesses (Florida Rock, Martin Marietta, Vulcan and Cemex) and three
Australian building materials companies (Boral, Rinker and James Hardie).
There is no retesting of performance under either the economic value added measurement or the TSR measurement.
The table below shows the conditional interests in shares of Executive Directors relating to awards made under the
LTIP in 2002, 2003, 2004 and 2005. For the conditional award made in 2002 to Executive Directors, none of the
award subject to a TSR performance measurement criteria and 50% of the award subject to an economic value
added performance measurement criteria vested following the end of the three year performance period. This
resulted in a total vesting of 25% of the maximum number of shares under the conditional awards.
For the conditional award made in 2003, it is anticipated that 47% of the award subject to a TSR performance
measurement and 65% of the award subject to an economic value added performance measurement criteria will 
vest following the end of the three year performance period. This would result in a total vesting of 56% of the 
maximum number of shares under the conditional awards.

Awards vesting under the L TIP are not pensionable.
Share Option Plan
Executive Directors and a selected number of senior executives from the Company’s worldwide operations
participated in the Share Option Plan. Under this Plan, participants are granted options over a number of shares but
the proportion of those shares under option which may be exercised is subject to the achievement of performance
targets over a three year performance period set by the Committee. T o the extent an option or part of an option
becomes capable of being exercised at the end of the three year performance period it will ordinarily remain
exercisable at any time up to 10 years from the date of grant.
The economic value added and TSR performance targets for the conditional options granted to Executive Directors 
in the years ending December 31, 2002, 2003, 2004 and 2005 were the same as for the awards made in 2002,
2003, 2004 and 2005 to the Executive Directors under the L TIP , as detailed above, with no retesting. Consequently,
for the grant made in 2003, it is anticipated that 56% of the number of shares under option will become exercisable
following the end of the three-year performance period.
The table below shows the numbers of shares under option of Executive Directors relating to conditional grants 
made under the Share Option Plan.

Notes
1) Following the end of the three year performance period a total of 25% of the shares under the conditional options granted on March 1, 2002
became capable of being exercised.
2) A J H Dougal and S N Vivian, former Executive Directors of the Company, left Hanson on May 14, 2002 and June 30, 2003, respectively. The
option grants made to them and outstanding at the date of leaving remained subject to the performance criteria as outlined above. Following 
the end of the three year performance period 25% of the shares under the conditional options granted on March 1, 2002 became capable of
being exercised. In respect of the grant on March 1, 2002, A J H Dougal and S N Vivian became entitled to options over 24,364 and 13,059
shares, respectively, at an exercise price of 461.75p per share. They exercised their options on November 23 and 21, 2005, respectively. 
3) During the period January 1, 2006 to February 23, 2006 there were no changes in the interests of Executive Directors in options under the 
Share Option Plan.
Under the Black-Scholes option valuation model, on the basis of the Company’s three year share price
performance, the value of an option over a share at the date of grant in 2005 was equal to approximately 30% of the
share’s current market value. On this basis, with no discount to the Black-Scholes value because of the application
of performance conditions on exercise, the conditional options granted during 2005 at 100% of basic salary had a
value, at the date of grant, of about 30% of basic salary. The market price at December 31, 2005 was 639p per
share, which compares to the exercise prices of the conditional options granted in 2003, 2004 and 2005 at prices
of 290.4p, 439.6p and 514.3p per share, respectively.
No further grants of option will be made under the Share Option Plan.
Any gains made under the Share Option Plan are not pensionable.
Executive Share Option Schemes
Options to subscribe for Hanson ordinary shares granted to Executive Directors under the Executive Share Option
Schemes are shown below. No performance conditions apply to the right to exercise the options granted. No grants
have been made under these schemes since 1998 and no further grants will be made under these schemes.

Share Option Schemes.
2) The figures shown in the table above for J C Nicholls are those of his wife, an employee who participates in the Executive Share Option Schemes.
Any gains made under the Executive Share Option Schemes are not pensionable. Sharesave Scheme
Many Hanson employees in the UK have built up an equity interest in the Company through the UK HM Revenue 
& Customs approved savings related Sharesave Scheme where options may be granted at a discount of up to 20%
to the market price at the date of grant. The term of options granted could be from three to seven years and any
option is conditional on a commitment by the participant to make regular savings from pay. The savings are held by
an independent Sharesave provider to buy shares at the end of the option period. The exercise of options under the
Sharesave Scheme can be satisfied by the issue of new shares or the transfer of existing shares. 
At December 31, 2005, there were approximately 2,600 participants in the Sharesave Scheme and the number of
shares under options granted to Executive Directors under the Sharesave Scheme are shown in the table below:

2) The figures shown in the table above for J C Nicholls include those of his wife, an employee, who also participates in the Sharesave Scheme.
3) During the period January 1, 2006 to February 23, 2006 there were no changes in the interests of Executive Directors in options under the
Sharesave Scheme.
Any gains made under the Sharesave Scheme are not pensionable.

List, during the period January 1 to December 31, 2005 was 451.5p to 640p.
Gains on exercise
The total gains made by Directors on options exercised or exercised for cash under the Share Option Plan, the
Executive Share Option Schemes, and the Sharesave Scheme were £253,908 (£94,063).
Performance review
The following graph shows the TSR performance of the Company and that of the FTSE 100 Index and the FTSE
350 Construction & Materials Index over the five-year period to December 31, 2005. The FTSE 100 Index was
selected due to its broad range of constituents of a large capitalisation, of which Hanson is a constituent company,
and the FTSE 350 Construction & Materials Index was selected as it contains the closest peer group to Hanson in
terms of activity and size, and Hanson is also a constituent company of this index.

Service contracts
The Executive Directors are all employed on rolling service contracts which are terminable at any time by Hanson 
on giving 52 weeks’ notice or by the Director giving 26 weeks’ notice. T ermination payments are limited to the
Director’s normal compensation, including basic salary, annual incentives and benefits, for the unexpired portion of
the notice period. Pensionable service will also accrue for the unexpired portion of the notice period. In the event
that Hanson terminates a service contract without notice the unexpired portion of the notice period will count
towards the calculation of entitlements under the Company’s L TIP and Share Option Plan; these awards would still
remain subject to their respective performance conditions.
The Chairman and Non-executive Directors do not have service contracts with Hanson. Each is appointed at the will
of the Company and the Chairman and Non-executive Director concerned under the terms of an appointment letter.
The terms and conditions of employment of the Chairman and the Non-executive Directors are available on request
from the Company Secretary.
External appointments
The Company acknowledges that its Executive Directors may be invited to become Non-executive Directors of
other leading companies and that such Non-executive duties can broaden experience and knowledge to the benefit
of Hanson. Executive Directors are limited to one such Non-executive position and the policy is that fees may be
retained. J C Nicholls is a Non-executive Director of Man Group plc, in respect of which he received fees of
£75,000 in 2005. No other such positions are held by any of the other Executive Directors.
Pensions
The Executive Directors are members of a defined benefit plan (the “pension plan”) which, in accordance with 
HM Revenue & Customs limits, provides them with a maximum pension of two-thirds of basic salary on retirement.
The pension plan is contributory until such time as the Director has completed the maximum pensionable service
allowed under the pension plan. Along with other members of the pension plan, for service accruing after July 1,
2004, the Executive Directors had a choice to retain the same accrual rate in the pension plan by paying an
increased contribution of 7 .5%, previously 5%, of pensionable salary (which does not include bonuses). The
Executive Directors have a normal retirement age of 60, with the right to receive early retirement pensions to be
paid from age 55 in certain circumstances.
The following table gives details for each Executive Director of:
– the increase in the accrued pension attributable to service since December 31, 2004.
– the increase in the accrued pension net of inflation attributable to service since December 31, 2004.
– the annual accrued pension payable from normal retirement age, calculated as if he had left service at
December 31, 2005.
– the transfer value of the increase of the accrued pension net of inflation and the Director’s contributions
calculated in accordance with actuarial guidance note GN11.
– the transfer value of the accrued pension at December 31, 2004, calculated in accordance with actuarial
guidance note GN11.
– the transfer value of the accrued pension at December 31, 2005, calculated in accordance with actuarial
guidance note GN11.
– the change in the transfer value over the year net of the Director’s contributions. It includes the effect of
fluctuations in the transfer value due to factors beyond the control of Hanson and the Directors, such as market
movements. A large part of the increase in the transfer value over the year has been as a result of a lower discount
rate applied to the pension plan’s liabilities.
These amounts exclude any benefits attributable to additional voluntary contributions.

Notes
1) Executive Directors and employees who joined the pension plan after May 1989 are subject to the earnings cap (currently £105,600) on 
HM Revenue & Customs approved pension plans. It is Hanson’s current policy to provide executives with appropriate benefits outside the
pension plan in relation to that part of their salary which exceeds the cap. The contributions made during the year were subject to income tax 
as a benefit in kind and the Executive Director concerned (J C Nicholls) was liable to settle the tax liability himself. 
2) G Dransfield has completed the maximum pensionable service allowed under the pension plan and did not accrue any further pension over 
the year.
3) In anticipation of the implementation of the UK government’s proposed simplification of the taxation of pensions, the Committee has reviewed the
impact of the proposals on all employees, including the Executive Directors. The approach to be adopted, following recommendations from the
independent advisor to the Committee, is for solutions which are essentially cost neutral to the Company with no compensation for changes in tax
legislation. All affected individuals have been given the opportunity to receive independent financial advice at the Company’s cost. Remuneration report

7) There were no termination payments made during the year.
Other than as shown under the L TIP and Share Option Plan on pages 63 and 64, no remuneration or other 
benefit was paid to former Directors during the year to December 31, 2005.

Independent auditors’ report to the shareholders of Hanson PLC
We have audited the group financial statements of Hanson PLC for the year ended December 31, 2005 which comprise the consolidated income
statement, the consolidated balance sheet, the consolidated cash flow statement, the consolidated statement of recognised income and expense
and the related notes 1 to 33. These group financial statements have been prepared under the accounting policies set out therein.
We have reported separately on the parent company financial statements of Hanson PLC for the year ended December 31, 2005 and on the
information in the Directors’ Remuneration report that is described as having been audited. 
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body, in accordance with Section 235 of the Companies Act 1985. Our audit work has
been undertaken so that we might state to the Company’s members those matters we are required to state to them in an auditors’ report and for no
other purpose. T o the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the Company and the
Company’s members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.
Respective responsibilities of Directors and auditors
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report and the group financial statements in accordance with applicable United Kingdom
law and International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union as set out in the statement of Directors’
responsibilities for the accounts.
Our responsibility is to audit the group financial statements in accordance with relevant legal and regulatory requirements and International
Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland).
We report to you our opinion as to whether the group financial statements give a true and fair view and whether the group financial statements have
been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985 and Article 4 of the IAS Regulation. We also report to you if, in our opinion, the
Directors’ report is not consistent with the group financial statements, if we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our
audit, or if information specified by law regarding Director’s remuneration and other transactions is not disclosed.
We review whether the Corporate governance statement reflects the Company’s compliance with the nine provisions of the 2003 FRC Combined
Code specified for our review by the Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority, and we report if it does not. We are not required to consider
whether the Board’s statements on internal control cover all risks and controls, or form an opinion on the effectiveness of the group’s corporate
governance procedures or its risk and control procedures.
We read other information contained in the Annual Report and Form 20-F consider whether it is consistent with the audited group financial
statements. The other information comprises only the Directors’ report, the Chairman’s statement, the Review of operations, Financial review and
the Corporate governance statement. We consider the implications for our report if we become aware of any apparent misstatements or material
inconsistencies with the group financial statements. Our responsibilities do not extend to any other information.
Basis of audit opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland) issued by the Auditing Practices Board. An audit
includes examination, on a test basis, of evidence relevant to the amounts and disclosures in the group financial statements. It also includes an
assessment of the significant estimates and judgments made by the Directors in the preparation of the group financial statements, and of whether
the accounting policies are appropriate to the group’s circumstances, consistently applied and adequately disclosed.
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the information and explanations which we considered necessary in order to provide us with
sufficient evidence to give reasonable assurance that the group financial statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud
or other irregularity or error. In forming our opinion we also evaluated the overall adequacy of the presentation of information in the group financial
statements.
Opinion
In our opinion, the group financial statements:
– give a true and fair view, in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union, of the state of the group’s affairs as at December 31,
2005 and of its profit for the year then ended; and
– have been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985 and Article 4 of the IAS Regulation.
Ernst & Y oung LLP , Registered auditor, London, February 23, 2006
Report of independent registered public accounting firm 
To the Board of Directors and shareholders of Hanson PLC
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Hanson PLC as of December 31, 2005 and 2004, and the related
consolidated income statements, consolidated cash flow statements and consolidated statements of recognised income and expense for
each of the two years in the period ended December 31, 2005. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management.
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland) and the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about
whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts
and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our
opinion.
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of
Hanson PLC at December 31, 2005 and 2004, and the consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the two years in the
period ended December 31, 2005, in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union which differ
in certain respects from accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (see note 33 of the Notes to the accounts).
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the effectiveness of
Hanson PLC’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2005, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated
Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organisations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated February 23, 2006 expressed
an unqualified opinion thereon.
Ernst & Y oung LLP , London, England, February 23, 2006  Auditors’ report
69
Report of independent registered public accounting firm 
To the Board of Directors and shareholders of Hanson PLC
We have audited management’s assessment, included in the accompanying Management’s Annual report on internal control over financial
reporting on page 59, that Hanson PLC maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2005, based on criteria
established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organisations of the Treadway Commission (the
COSO criteria). Hanson PLC’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment
of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on management’s assessment and an
opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.
We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards
require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was
maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, evaluating management’s
assessment, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing such other procedures as we
considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial
reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A
company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in
reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that
transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles,
and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorisations of management and Directors of the
company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorised acquisition, use, or disposition of the
company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any
evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that
the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
In our opinion, management’s assessment that Hanson PLC maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2005,
is fairly stated, in all material respects, based on the COSO criteria. Also, in our opinion, Hanson PLC maintained, in all material respects, effective
internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2005, based on the COSO criteria.
We also have audited, in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland) and the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheets of Hanson PLC as of December 31, 2005 and 2004, and the related
consolidated income statements, consolidated cash flow statements and consolidated statements of recognised income and expense for each of
the two years in the period ended December 31, 2005 and our report dated February 23, 2006 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

73 1 Accounting policies
Basis of preparation
From January 1, 2005, as required by the European Union’s IAS Regulation, the group has prepared its Annual Report and Form 20-F in accordance with
International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted by the European Union (EU) and in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act
1985. IFRS as adopted by the EU differ in certain respects from IFRS as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB). However, the
consolidated financial statements for the periods presented would be no different had the Company applied IFRS as issued by the IASB. References to
IFRS hereafter should be construed as references to IFRS as adopted by the EU.
Since this is the first year in which the group has prepared financial statements under IFRS, the comparatives have been restated from accounting
principles generally accepted in the UK (UK GAAP) to comply with IFRS. The reconciliation to IFRS from the previously published UK GAAP financial
information is provided in note 32.
IFRS differs in certain respects from US generally accepted accounting principles, a reconciliation to which is included in note 33 of the accounts. 
A summary of the group's key accounting policies is set out below.
The financial statements have been prepared using the historical cost convention except where the measurements of balances at fair value is
required as explained below.
Basis of consolidation
The accounting reference date of the Company is December 31. The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the
Company and its subsidiaries together with the group’s share of the results of joint-ventures and associates using the equity method of accounting.
Within the income statement, the group’s share of results of joint-ventures and associates is stated after interest and taxation.
Use of estimates
The preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions. These affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities; the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements; and the reported amounts of revenues and
expenses during the reporting period. Critical accounting policies are set out in the Financial review.
Turnover
T urnover is recognised by the group when the risks and rewards associated with the transaction have been transferred to the purchaser which is
demonstrated when all the following conditions are met: evidence of a binding arrangement exists (generally, purchase orders), products have been
delivered or services have been rendered, there is no future performance required and amounts are collectable under normal payment terms.
T urnover represents the net amounts charged or chargeable in respect of services rendered and goods supplied, excluding inter company sales,
value added tax and other sales taxes. T urnover is recognised net of any discounts given to the customer. T urnover on long-term construction
contracts is recognised as the value of measured works, claims and variations on contracts in the year, based on the stage of completion. Claims
and variations are only recognised where they have been agreed with the customer. Where it is foreseen that a loss will arise to the group on a long-
term contract, full provision is made for that loss during the year.
Research and development
Expenditure on development and improvement of new and existing products that do not meet the recognition criteria of an intangible asset are
expensed as incurred. Research costs are expensed as incurred. 
Advertising costs
Expenditure on advertising is expensed in full in the period in which it is incurred.
Share-based payments
The cost of equity-settled transactions with employees, for awards granted after November 7 , 2002, is measured at fair value on the date of grant 
and is recognised as an expense over the vesting period. Fair value is determined by an external valuer using an appropriate pricing model. In valuing
equity-settled transactions, no account is taken of any vesting conditions, other than conditions linked to the price of the shares of the Company
(market conditions).
For awards evaluated on non-market conditions or no performance criteria, an expense is ultimately only recognised for awards which vest. Where an
award is dependent upon a market condition, the cost of the award is recognised irrespective of whether the award vests unless the employee leaves
during the vesting period. At each balance sheet date before vesting, the cumulative expense is calculated representing the extent to which the vesting
period has expired and management’s best estimate of the number of equity instruments that will ultimately vest. The movement in cumulative expense
since the previous balance sheet date is recognised in the income statement, with a corresponding entry in equity. 
The cost of cash-settled transactions is measured at fair value using a binomial model. During the vesting period a liability is recognised based on
the portion of the vesting period expired at the balance sheet date. From the end of the vesting period until settlement, the liability represents the full
fair value of the award as at the balance sheet date. 
The own shares reserve includes shares purchased by the Company’s ESOP Trust to satisfy awards. These are recognised as a deduction to equity.
Dividends
Dividends attributable to the equity holders of the Company declared during the year are recognised directly in equity. Interim dividends are
recognised when paid.
Foreign currencies
Average rates of exchange ruling during the year have been used to translate the transactions in foreign currencies, and the income statements of
overseas subsidiaries, joint-ventures and associates from their functional currency.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated from their functional currency at balance sheet exchange rates. The
balance sheets of overseas subsidiaries, joint-ventures and associates are translated at rates ruling at the balance sheet date from their functional
currency. Differences on translation arising from changes in the sterling value of overseas net assets, related foreign currency loans, foreign exchange
contracts and currency swaps at the beginning of the accounting year, or at the date of any later capital currency conversions, together with the
differences between income statements translated at average rates and at balance sheet rates, are shown as a movement on reserves and in the
statement of recognised income and expense. Other exchange rate differences are dealt with in the income statement for the year.
Business combinations
The results of companies and businesses acquired are dealt with in the consolidated accounts from the date of acquisition. Upon the acquisition 
of a business, the fair values that reflect their condition at the date of acquisition are attributed to the identifiable assets (including separately
identifiable intangible assets) acquired and liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed. Adjustments are also made to bring the accounting policies
of businesses acquired into alignment with those of the group. Where the consideration paid for a business exceeds the fair value of net assets
acquired and liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed, the difference is treated as goodwill.

for the 1 2 months ended December 31, 2005
Notes to the accounts
74 1 Accounting policies continued
Intangible assets
Goodwill arising on acquisitions completed prior to January 1, 1998 was written off directly to reserves. From January 1, 1998 to December 31,
2003, all acquired goodwill was capitalised and amortised over a period not exceeding 20 years. On January 1, 2004, the date of transition to IFRS,
goodwill relating to acquisitions was maintained at its net book value. From January 1, 2004 onwards, goodwill is capitalised. 
Intangible assets other than goodwill, which are capable of being recognised separately and measured reliably on acquisition of a business, 
are capitalised at fair value on acquisition. Expenditure on computer software which is deemed not to be integral to the computer hardware is
capitalised at cost. The useful lives of intangible assets are assessed as either finite or indefinite. Intangible assets with a finite life are amortised 
on a straight line basis over their useful lives. Intangible assets with an indefinite life are not amortised but reviewed annually for impairment.
Property, plant and equipment (including mineral reserves)
Property, plant and equipment is shown at cost less depreciation, depletion and any impairments. The cost of property, plant and equipment
comprises its purchase price and any costs directly attributable to bringing it into working condition for its intended use or its deemed cost on
transition to IFRS. Costs to develop new commercial aggregates deposits and for major development programmes at existing sites are capitalised
and amortised over the life of the quarry. Repair and maintenance costs are charged to costs and overheads as incurred. No depreciation is
provided on freehold land except for mineral reserves which are depleted on the basis of tonnage extracted. Depreciation of other property, plant
and equipment is calculated to write off their cost over their expected useful lives allowing for estimated residual value. The majority of property,
plant and equipment is written off on a straight line basis over the following periods:
Plant and equipment 2-30 years
Land, buildings and natural resources up to 50 years
Finance costs relating to the purchase of property, plant and equipment are not capitalised but are expensed as incurred. Exchanges of assets 
are measured at fair value of the asset given up unless the exchange transaction lacks commercial substance.
Assets held under leases
Assets held under finance leases are included within property, plant and equipment at the capitalised value of the future minimum lease payments
and are depreciated over the shorter of their lease period and their useful life. The capital element of the future payments is treated as a liability and
the interest element is charged to the income statement so as to reflect a constant annual rate of interest on the remaining balance of the
outstanding obligation. Rentals paid on operating leases are charged to the income statement on a straight line basis over the shorter of the lease
period and the useful life of the leased asset.
Asset retirement obligations
A provision is recognised for the fair value of asset retirement costs in the period in which the obligation arises. An asset representing the future cost
of dismantling facilities, where the group has a legal or constructive obligation, is recorded and depreciated over its useful life. Other reclamation
costs associated with the restoration of sites, following the extraction of aggregates and clay, are expensed as incurred.
Asset impairment
Intangible assets and property, plant and equipment are reviewed, at least annually, to ensure that assets are not carried above their recoverable
amounts. Where some indication of impairment exists, detailed calculations are made of the discounted cash flows resulting from continued use of
the assets (value in use) or from their disposal (fair value less costs to sell). Where these values are less than the carrying amount of the assets, an
impairment loss is charged to the income statement.
Investments in joint-ventures and associates
The group’s investments in its joint-ventures and associates are accounted for under the equity method of accounting.
Under the equity method, the investment in the joint-venture or associate is carried in the balance sheet at cost plus post-acquisition changes in the
group’s share of net assets of the joint-venture or associate. Goodwill relating to a joint-venture or associate is included in the carrying amount of the
investment and is not amortised. After application of the equity method, the group determines whether it is necessary to recognise any additional
impairment loss with respect to the group’s net investment in the joint-venture or associate. The income statement amount reflects the share of the
results after interest and tax of operations of the joint-ventures and associates. Where there has been a change recognised directly in the equity of the
joint-venture or associate, the group recognises its share of any changes and discloses this in the reconciliation of changes in total equity, and where
appropriate, in the consolidated statement of recognised income and expense.
The joint-ventures’ and associates’ accounting policies conform to those used by the group for like transactions and events in similar circumstances.
Inventories and receivables
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value, on a first in first out basis. Cost includes raw materials, direct labour and
expenses, and an appropriate proportion of production and other overheads. Full provision is made against slow moving inventories based on
historical experience and current market conditions. Receivables are stated after deducting a provision for doubtful debts.
Government grants
Grants received from governments for the acquisition of assets are recognised only when there is reasonable assurance that the grant will be
received and any conditions attached to them have been fulfilled. The grant is held on the balance sheet within accrued income and released to 
the income statement over the periods necessary to match the related depreciation charges or other expenses of the asset as they are incurred. 
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash in hand and current balances with banks and other similar institutions, which are readily convertible into
known cash amounts and which are subject to insignificant risk of changes in value and have a maturity of three months or less at the date of inception.
For the purposes of the cash flow statement, cash and cash equivalents consists of cash and cash equivalents as defined above, net of bank overdrafts.
Derivatives, financial instruments, interest bearing loans and borrowings 
The group has taken advantage of the exemption not to restate comparatives for IAS 32 “Financial Instruments: Disclosure and Presentation” and
IAS 39 “Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement” but to apply these standards from January 1, 2005. As a result, the Financial instruments
(current year) and Interest bearing loans and borrowings (current year) policies presented below apply with effect from January 1, 2005 and the
Financial instruments (prior year) and Interest bearing loans and borrowings (prior year) policies applied from January 1, 2004 to December 31, 2004.
Derivative financial instruments (current year)
Derivative financial instruments are used to manage the financial risks arising from the business activities of the group and the financing of those
activities. Derivative financial instruments are not held for trading purposes.
Derivative financial instruments are used for managing financial risks as follows:
–Forward exchange contracts are used as balance sheet hedging instruments to hedge foreign currency net assets held overseas. 
– Interest rate swaps are used to hedge the group’s exposure to movements in interest rates. The interest payable or receivable on such swaps 
is accrued on an effective interest basis. 
Notes to the accounts
75 1 Accounting policies continued
The group applies IAS 39, under which hedge accounting is allowed when certain criteria are met. Under IAS 39, derivative financial instruments 
are always measured at fair value, with hedge accounting employed in respect of those derivatives fulfilling the stringent requirements for hedge
accounting as prescribed under IAS 39. In summary, these criteria relate to initial designation and documentation of the hedge relationship,
prospective testing of the relationship to demonstrate the expectation that the hedge will be highly effective throughout its life, and subsequent
retrospective testing of the hedge to verify effectiveness. The accounting treatment for the group’s hedge relationships are described by class 
below. Hedge effectiveness is reviewed regularly. If a hedge becomes ineffective, hedge accounting ceases to apply and subsequent changes 
in fair values of the derivative are recognised in the income statement. 
Fair value hedges
The group uses interest rate swaps to hedge the group’s exposure to changes in the fair value of fixed rate debt as a result of interest rate movements.
The interest on such swaps is accrued on an effective interest basis. The carrying amount of the hedged item is adjusted for gains and losses
attributable to the risk being hedged. For effective hedges, changes in the fair values of both the hedge and the portion of the hedged item covered
by the hedge are recognised in the income statement. If a hedge becomes ineffective, the hedged item ceases to be remeasured with subsequent
changes in fair value. Instead, the portion of its carrying value relating to previous changes in fair value is amortised over its remaining life.
Cash flow hedges
The group uses interest rate swaps to hedge its exposure to floating rate debt and uses foreign exchange forwards as cash flow hedges to manage
its exposure to currency fluctuations on its future cash flows. For effective cash flow hedges changes in the fair value of the hedge are recognised in
equity, where they are recycled through the profit and loss in the same period during which the hedged item impacts the income statement. For
hedges that become ineffective the amount previously recognised in equity is recycled to the income statement. Where the underlying hedged item
is no longer expected to occur, this recycling is effected immediately. If the underlying hedged item is still expected to occur then the recycling from
equity happens when the forecast transaction occurs. 
Net investment hedges
Currency borrowings and forward exchange contracts are used as balance sheet hedging instruments to hedge foreign currency net assets held
overseas. Regarding forward exchange contracts, the initial valuation of the forward element of the contract and any subsequent movement in its
valuation is recognised directly in the income statement. The spot element forms the net investment hedge relationship, and any movement in its
valuation, so long as the relationship is effective, is recognised in equity. If the hedge becomes ineffective, movements in the valuation of the spot
element are recognised directly in the income statement. On disposal of a foreign currency investment, the cumulative gains and losses are recycled
from equity to the extent that they related to hedges of the investment being disposed of. 
Derivative financial instruments (prior year)
The group considers its derivative financial instruments to be hedges when certain criteria are met. The group’s criteria for an instrument to qualify
for hedge accounting are that the instrument must be related to an asset, liability or forecast cash flow, it must involve the same currency as the
hedged item and it must offset the effect of movements in foreign exchange and/or interest rates on the relevant asset, liability, cash flow or reported
results of the group.
Derivative financial instruments are accounted for using hedge accounting as follows:
–Forward exchange contracts are used as balance sheet hedging instruments to hedge foreign currency net investments. The difference
between the spot and forward rate for these contracts is recognised as part of the net interest payable over the period of the contract. The spot
rate of foreign currency hedges is revalued to the rate of exchange at the balance sheet date and aggregate unrealised gains or losses arising
on revaluation are included in other debtors/other creditors. Both realised and unrealised gains and losses on these contracts are taken to
reserves to the extent that those contracts relate to foreign currency investments.
– Interest rate swaps are used to hedge the group’s exposure to movements in interest rates. The interest payable or receivable on such swaps 
is accrued in the same way as interest arising on deposits or borrowings. Interest rate swaps are not revalued to fair value prior to maturity.
Interest bearing loans and borrowings (current year) 
All loans and borrowings are initially recognised at fair value less directly attributable transaction costs. After initial recognition, interest-bearing
loans and borrowings are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. Gains and losses arising on the
repurchase, settlement or otherwise cancellation of liabilities are recognised respectively in finance income and finance costs. The fair value
measurement of fixed rate loans forming part of fair value hedges is discussed below under the derivatives and financial instruments policy. 
Interest bearing loans and borrowings (prior year) 
All loans and borrowings are initially stated at the amount of the net proceeds. Interest is charged to the profit and loss at the coupon rate, whilst
discounts and fees are amortised on a straight line basis over the term of the debt. Accrued interest costs are included in accruals to the extent that
they will be paid in the next accounting period. Gains and losses arising on the repurchase, settlement or otherwise cancellation of liabilities are
recognised in the period in which the repurchase or early settlement is made.
Provisions
Provisions for non-current obligations are discounted using a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments. The unwinding of the discount
on provisions is included within finance costs along with the effect on the provision of changes in the discount rate.
Provisions are classified as current when they are expected to be settled within 12 months of the balance sheet date.
Pensions and other post-retirement benefits
The group’s current and past service cost for defined benefit schemes is charged to operating profit. Interest on the defined benefit schemes’
obligations and the expected return on the schemes’ assets are recognised in net finance costs. Actuarial gains and losses are recognised directly
in equity through the statement of recognised income and expense so that the group’s balance sheet reflects the fair value of the schemes’
surpluses or deficits as at the balance sheet date.
Contributions to defined contribution schemes are charged to operating profit as they become payable. Multi-employer schemes are accounted for
as defined contribution schemes, where the group is unable to obtain adequate information regarding its share of the schemes’ assets and liabilities
to account for these as defined benefit schemes.
The group has elected to adopt the IASB’s amendment to IAS 19 “Employee benefits” to permit the recognition of actuarial gains and losses
directly in equity rather than apply the 10% corridor method. The group has applied this methodology from the date of transition to IFRS.
Deferred taxation
Deferred tax is provided, using the liability method, on all temporary differences at the balance sheet date between the tax bases of assets and
liabilities and their carrying value except to the extent that the temporary difference arises from:
– the initial recognition of goodwill;
– the initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction which is not a business combination and, at the time of the transaction, affects
neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss;
– temporary differences in respect of the unremitted earnings of subsidiaries, joint-ventures and associates where the parent is able to control
the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.

A deferred tax asset is recognised for all deductible temporary differences, carry-forward of unused tax losses and unused tax credits to the extent 
it is probable that future taxable profit will be available against which the deductible temporary differences, unused tax losses and unused tax credits
can be utilised. T ax assets and liabilities are offset, if a legally enforceable right exists to set off the tax assets against the tax liabilities and the taxes
relate to the same taxable entity and the same taxation authority.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured, on an undiscounted basis, at the tax rates that are expected to apply to the period when the asset is
realised or the liability is settled, based on tax rates (and tax laws) that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date. The
carrying amount of a deferred tax asset is reviewed at each balance sheet date.
Income tax relating to items recognised directly in equity is recognised in equity and not in the income statement. 
Treasury shares
Own equity instruments which are reacquired (treasury shares) are deducted from equity. No gain or loss is recognised in profit or loss on the
purchase, sale, issue or cancellation of the Company’s own equity instruments. 
New IFRS standards and interpretations not applied
During 2005, the IASB and IFRIC issued additional standards and interpretations which are effective for periods starting after the date of these
financial statements. The following standards and interpretations have yet to be adopted by the group:
International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS/IAS) Effective date

IFRIC 7 Applying the Restatement Approach under IAS 29 Financial Reporting in Hyperinflationary Economies March 1, 2006
IFRIC 8 Scope of IFRS 2 May 1, 2006
The group does not anticipate that the adoption of these standards and interpretations will have a material effect on its financial statements on initial
adoption. Upon adoption of IFRS 7 , the group will be required to disclose additional information about its financial instruments, their significance and
the nature and extent of the risks to which they give rise, together with greater detail as to the fair value of its financial instruments and its risk 
exposure. There will be no effect on reported income or net assets.
2 Segmental analysis
The group’s primary segments are the trading operations of North America, UK, Australia, Asia Pacific and Continental Europe. These operations 
are organised and managed separately according to the geographic location of their assets and economic environment. There are no significant
transactions occurring between the primary segments.
There are two secondary business segments, Aggregates and Building Products. The major products for each secondary segment, which differ
slightly between countries, are as follows:
Aggregates – crushed rock and sand and gravel, asphalt, cement and ready-mixed concrete.
Building products – bricks, concrete pipe and products, concrete flooring, precast concrete and roofing tiles.
Hanson’s business operations, as shown below, are managed using a combination of primary and secondary structures in eight distinct segments,
including the corporate office and related costs, that are described as Central.

Remuneration report.
5 Share-based payments
Included within wages and salaries in note 4 is an expense arising from share-based payment transactions of £7 .6m (£4.9m) all of which relates to 
equity-settled share-based payments. Details of each of the employee share plans in place are given below and where applicable in the 
Remuneration report.
Long T erm Incentive Plan
The group operates a Long T erm Incentive Plan (L TIP) under which awards of shares are made, on a conditional basis, subject to performance
measurements over a three year period. The vesting of 50% of each award is dependent on total shareholder return (TSR) achieved by Hanson
measured by reference to a comparator group of companies. As relative TSR is defined as a market condition, a Monte Carlo simulation model has been
applied. Further details in relation to the TSR measurement are provided in the Remuneration report. The remaining 50% of each award is dependent on
an economic value added measure which is classified as a non-market condition and has therefore been valued using a binomial model. Awards are 
equity settled and where the performance measurement targets are obtained in part or in full, vested shares are distributed to LTIP participants as soon
as practicable after the end of the performance period.
Conditional awards were made over 3,139,356 ordinary shares on March 1, 2005 which will vest, subject to the performance measurement targets
being attained, on March 1, 2008. The weighted average fair value of each share award granted is £3.45 (£3.01). The expense recognised in the
income statement in the year from the L TIP is £6.1m (£4.1m).
The fair value of total awards granted during the year is £10.8m (£10.9m).
The following table illustrates the number of, and movements in, share awards during the year under this plan:

Exercised (767 .6) (1,113.0)
At December 31 11,036.2 11,489.8
Share Option Plan
The group also operates a discretionary Share Option Plan under which participants are granted options over a number of shares but the proportion
of these shares under option which may be exercised is subject to the achievement of performance targets over a three year performance period. 
As with the L TIP , the vesting of 50% of the options is dependent on TSR and therefore valued using a Monte Carlo simulation model. The remaining
50% of the options is dependent on an economic value added measure which has been valued using a binomial model. T o the extent any options
vest, they will ordinarily remain exercisable at any time up to 10 years from the date of grant and are settled in equity once exercised.
Options were granted over 647 ,620 ordinary shares on March 1, 2005 and, subject to the performance measurement targets being attained, will be
exercisable between March 1, 2008 and February 28, 2015 at an exercise price of 514.3p per share. The weighted average fair value of each share
option granted is £1 .1 0 (£1.1 1). The expense recognised in the income statement in the year from the share option plan is £0.6m (£0.4m).

Sharesave Scheme
The group also operates a UK HM Revenue & Customs approved savings related Sharesave Scheme available to all UK employees. Options
are granted at a discount of up to 20% to the market price at the date of invitation over three, five or seven year savings contracts and options are
exercisable during the six month period following completion of the savings contract. Options are valued using a Black-Scholes model.
During 2005, options were granted over 1,454,265 shares which will ordinarily be exercisable at an exercise price of 395.0p per share during the
period; June 1 to November 30, 2008 for the three year Scheme; June 1 to November 30, 2010 for the five year Scheme; and June 1 to November 
30, 2012 for the seven year Scheme. The weighted average fair value of each share option granted is £1.34 (2004: £1.43). The expense
recognised in the income statement in the year from the Sharesave Scheme is £0.9m (2004: £0.4m).

The weighted average share price during the year is 544.0p (412.0p). 
The expected volatility for Hanson has been calculated using historical data over a term commensurate with the expected life of each option/award.
The expected volatility figures used in the valuations were calculated based on the following principles:
– Historic weekly volatility over periods of increasing length ending on the date of each grant were determined.
–The volatility figures above were used to calculate a weighted average volatility for the term commensurate with the expected term of the award
being valued.
Other Schemes
Hanson has other share option schemes, the Executive Share Option Schemes A and B (which are now closed) and the HM Revenue & Customs
approved Executive Share Option Scheme. No further grants of options will be made under these schemes. The options granted under the
Executive Share Option Schemes A and B are deemed to be cash-settled and consequently grants that had not been settled by January 1, 2005
have been accounted for under IFRS 2. Options were granted with an exercise price equal to market value and remained exercisable at any time 
up to 10 years from the date of grant. No performance conditions applied to the right to exercise the options granted under either scheme. At
December 31, 2005 there are no options outstanding under the Executive Share Option Schemes A and B and as a result the carrying amount 
of the liability relating to the cash-settled options at December 31, 2005 is £nil (£0.4m).
The following tables illustrate the number and weighted average exercise prices of, and movements in, share options for the other schemes.

Impairments during the year:
The net impairment charge for the year is £4.0m. 
An impairment charge of £16.5m has been recognised against goodwill held in Hanson Aggregates North America Southwest region. The impairment,
which reduces the goodwill’s carrying value to its value in use at discount rates provided below, resulted from a change in the economic circumstances of
that operation.
An impairment provision of £14.9m recorded against tangible assets, mainly plant and equipment in Hanson Aggregates North America West 
region, has been reversed. The original charge resulted from significant uncertainty over the assets’ ability to generate future profitability, due to the
lack of an economic supply of raw materials. The supply has now been secured, removing this uncertainty and improving the projected cash flows
generated by these assets. 
An impairment charge of £5.3m has been recognised against goodwill and tangible assets at various individual operating sites within Hanson
Aggregates UK. These tangible assets are cash generating units for the purpose of measuring impairment, as they generate largely independent 
cash flows. The impairments have arisen due to the closure, or intended closure of the sites, on commercial grounds and are based on the 
recoverable amount of the assets. Impairment charges totalling £4.7m against individual operating sites within Hanson Aggregates UK have been
reversed, as anticipated proceeds from the sale of the site and business exceeded their carrying values, net of the provision. 
T angible assets of £1.2m located in Spain and goodwill amounting to £0.6m in the Czech Republic have been impaired, as these assets are not
expected to generate a value in use equal to their carrying value. Both of these cash generating units comprise a part of Hanson Continental Europe. 
Assumptions used:
The recoverable amount for each cash generating unit is based on a value in use calculation using cash flow projections based on four year forecasts
approved by the Board of Directors excluding the impact of anticipated acquisitions, business improvement capital expenditure and restructuring.
Forecast replacement capital expenditure requirements are included within the first four years, after which capital is assumed to represent 100% of
depreciation.
Subsequent cash flows beyond the initial four year forecast for all cash generating units are inflated by rates of 0.7% to 4.9% (nil% to 4.0%) including
the US 4.0% (4.0%), UK 3.0% (2.5%) and Australia 2.5% (2.5%). Cash flows have been discounted at rates between 7 .5% and 9.5% (8.0% and
10.0%) including the US 8% (8.5%), UK 8.5% (8.5%) and Australia 9.5% (9.5%).
The calculation of value in use is most sensitive to the following key assumptions:
–Sales volumes
–Average selling prices
– Operating costs
The sales volume assumptions are influenced by several factors including, end use market and demand drivers, our competitive position, quality of
product and service, distribution and product selling price. Historical sales volumes are used as the base. These are either increased or decreased
over the forecast period using assumptions derived from past experience or consistent with external sources of information.
Average selling price assumptions are influenced by several factors including end use market and demand drivers, our competitive position, site
tenure, quality of product and service, distribution and product selling price. Historical average selling prices are used as the base. These are either
increased or decreased over the forecast period using assumptions derived from past experience.
Operating cost assumptions are influenced by several factors including availability of product and service, supply and demand, scarcity of availability,
global markets, and age and quality of plant and equipment. Historical operating costs are used as the base. These are either increased or decreased
over the forecast period using assumptions derived from past experience.
The principal risks and uncertainties are disclosed in more detail on pages 45 to 48 of this document.
Where business segments include closed sites or sites that are to be closed, the anticipated proceeds less costs to sell have been used. Goodwill is
analysed by segment in note 2(e).

Provision for taxes in respect of current and prior periods are based on information at the balance sheet date. These balances will change as new 
accounting estimates are developed during the period as a result of new events and additional information. 
The tax charge will be unaffected by the payment of dividends by the Company to its shareholders.
e) Factors that may affect future tax charges
T ax losses and other deductible temporary differences with a value of £934.6m (£561.0m) have not been recognised as their use is uncertain or not
currently anticipated. The increase is due to the resolution of prior years’ loss position with the tax authorities.
The losses and temporary differences have no expiry date.
At December 31, 2005, the group has not provided deferred tax in relation to temporary differences on its foreign subsidiaries, associates or 
joint-ventures. Quantifying the temporary differences is not practical, however, based on current enacted law and on the basis that the group can
control the timing and realisation of these temporary differences, no material tax consequences are expected to arise. 
9 Discontinued operations
During 2005, Hanson Aggregates North America sold its 50% interest in the joint-venture Campbell Concrete and Materials, a ready-mixed concrete
and aggregates business operating in Houston, T exas on June 17 for £31.0m; and Hanson Continental Europe disposed of 19 ready-mixed concrete
sites on May 13 for £14.0m, following restructuring of its Spanish operations. 
The operations of Seagoe, a drainage business based in Northern Ireland, are not considered to be core to the strategic direction of Hanson
Building Products UK. As such, these operations were classified as held for sale at the balance sheet date and were subsequently sold for £4.0m
on January 31, 2006.
During 2004, Hanson Building Products UK sold its drainage business on May 14; Hanson Aggregates UK sold the Portland Stone operations on
December 22 and the Pinden operations on December 24; and Hanson Asia Pacific sold its Thailand operations on July 19. 
Note 9(a) below analyses the profit after tax of £2.8m earned during the year by the operations discontinued in 2005. The loss of £16.4m in the
prior year represents the net loss after tax incurred during the prior year by the operations discontinued in both 2004 and 2005.
Note 9(b) below analyses the profit after tax of £2.3m resulting from the disposal of operations discontinued in 2005. The profit of £10.4m in the
prior year represents the profit on disposal after tax of discontinued operations disposed of during 2004. 
Note 9(c) below analyses the loss after tax of £12.4m that resulted from adjustments in the current year to the profit or loss on disposals (and other
income and expenses) of operations that were discontinued in prior years. The loss after tax of £50.0m in 2004 represents adjustments made in the
prior year to the profit or loss on disposals (and other incomes and expenses) of operations that were discontinued prior to 2005.
Note 9(d) provides an analysis of the net cash inflow after financing of £1.4m generated from operations discontinued in 2005. The net cash inflow
of £5.3m in the prior year represents the cash flows generated during the prior year by operations discontinued in 2005 and 2004.
Note 9(e) provides an analysis of the net assets of discontinued operations that were disposed of or classified as held for sale in 2005. The
comparative provides the equivalent information for operations disposed of or held for sale in 2004.

provision established at the time of demerger and charges of a similar nature are expected in the future.
Included within the asbestos charge of £22.4m (charge of £79.7m) is a charge of £0.6m (£nil) due to discounting. The tax credit on loss from prior
years’ disposals of £13.4m (credit of £39.1m) includes a credit of £8.7m (credit of £31.1m) relating to asbestos. This results in a post-tax charge

policy and reinvestment programme.
11 Earnings per ordinary share
The calculation of the basic earnings per ordinary share of 53.2p (36.0p) is based on the weighted average of 728,300,283 (734,257 ,732) ordinary 
shares in issue during the year and profit attributable to equity holders of the Company of £387 .3m (£264.3m). The basic earnings per ordinary 
share for continuing operations of 54.2p (43.6p) is calculated using the same number of shares referred to above and on earnings of £394.6m
(£320.3m). Earnings per share is also calculated below, before impairments, since the Directors consider that this gives a useful indication of
underlying performance.
The calculation of the diluted earnings per ordinary share of 52.6p (35.6p) is based on the weighted average of 735,664,121 (741,105,680) ordinary
shares and the profit attributable to equity holders of the Company of £387 .3m (£264.3m). The diluted earnings per ordinary share of continuing
operations of 53.6p (43.2p) is calculated using the same number of shares referred to immediately above and on earnings of £394.6m (£320.3m).
The reconciliation from basic earnings per share to diluted earnings per share is given as follows:

The basic earnings per share figure of 53.2p (36.0p), is calculated by taking the profit attributable to equity holders of the Company for the financial
year (described as earnings above), and dividing this by the weighted average ordinary shares in issue, after deducting shares held in employee 
trusts or as treasury shares. The basic ‘earnings’ number used has been adjusted by adding back impairments above. 
The diluted earnings per share figure of 52.6p (35.6p) is calculated by taking the basic number of shares above and adjusting these for the notional
exercise of outstanding long-term incentive awards and options, where these would be deemed to have a dilutive impact. 
The basic and diluted earnings per share of the 2005 and 2004 acquisitions is 1.6p and 0.3p respectively.

Asbestos
Various of the Company’s US subsidiaries are defendants, typically with many other companies, in lawsuits filed in state and federal courts by
claimants who allege that they have suffered bodily injury as a result of exposure to asbestos-containing products, the manufacture of which by such
subsidiaries ceased, depending on the subsidiary involved, between 1973 and 1984, which was prior to the time that these subsidiaries became
members of the group.
The discounted pre-tax provision for the gross cost of asbestos is shown above. The related insurance asset is included within “Receivables” in note
17 and the deferred tax asset relating to asbestos payments is included within “Deferred tax” in note 22.
Claimant numbers and costs during the year 
Information regarding the movement in asbestos claimants in the year and the cost of resolution in the year is provided below:
2005 2004
New claimants 10,350 18,700
Resolutions (14,750) (7 ,150)
Outstanding claimants 131,350 135,750
Average gross cost of resolution ($) 2,929 8,294
Gross cost of resolution ($m) 43.2 59.3
Less insurance recoveries ($m) (11.5) (46.5)
Net cost before tax ($m) 31.7 12.8
New claimants were 10,350 for 2005, compared with the 18,700 claimants in 2004. At the end of 2005, outstanding claimants totalled approximately
131,350 (135,750). Of the 14,750 (7 ,150) claimants whose cases were resolved during 2005, over 90% were dismissed without payment. In the
USA, claimants can file without illness or product identification. In the absence to date of federal reform, a number of states have introduced or are
looking to introduce an unimpaired docket which will suspend claims until there is proven evidence of illness. Although outstanding claimants
decreased as at the end of 2005 compared to 2004, this does not mean that the Company believes that 2005 is the start of a downward trend in
the number of claimants.
The gross cost of resolving asbestos claims in 2005 was $43.2m ($59.3m) including legal fees of $26.3m ($27 .4m). The pre-tax cost of asbestos
for the year after insurance was $31.7m ($12.8m).
The aggregate amounts paid in settlement and average settlement payments in any given period, together with related defence costs, have
fluctuated widely and are expected to continue to fluctuate widely depending on the nature of the claims resolved (including the proportion of which
that are mass claims), disease mix, number of other defendants and jurisdiction of claim.
Notes to the accounts continued
for the 1 2 months ended December 31, 2005
Notes to the accounts
96 21 Provisions continued
Each of the Company’s relevant US subsidiaries, together with its insurance carriers and outside counsel, review each asbestos claim that is 
pursued by claimants. In many cases claimants are unable to demonstrate that any injury they have suffered resulted from exposure to the
subsidiary’s products, in which case their claim is generally dismissed without payment. In those cases where a compensatable disease, exposure
to the subsidiary’s products and causation can be established by claimants, the subsidiary generally settles for amounts that reflect the type of
disease, the seriousness of the injury, the age of the claimant, the particular jurisdiction of the claim and the number and solvency of the other
defendants.
The Company’s approach to accounting for the asbestos claims against its US subsidiaries is to provide for those costs of resolution which are both
probable and reliably estimable. The costs of resolving possible claims are disclosed as contingent liabilities (refer note 26). At present, based on
detailed analysis and the assumptions noted below, the provision for those costs which are both probable and reliably estimable equates to
approximately eight years of gross cost, assuming an annual level of approximately US$60m. Whilst further claims are likely to be resolved beyond
this eight year period, the associated costs of resolution are not able to be reliably estimated and hence no provision has been made to cover these
possible liabilities.
Assumptions made in establishing the provision relate to the number, disease mix and location of future claimants, trends in dismissal rates,
settlement and defence costs, resolution of all existing claimants, time scale of resolution of new claimants, the continued solvency of co-defendants
and expected insurance recoveries. In light of the significant uncertainty associated with asbestos claims, there can be no guarantee that the
assumptions used to estimate the provision for the cost of resolving asbestos claims will be an accurate prediction of the actual costs that may be
incurred and as a result the provision will be subject to potential revision from time to time as additional information becomes available and to reflect
any changes in trends.
Gross cost provision
The provision of $480.0m at January 1, 2005 was increased by $60.0m (the estimated gross cost for an additional year) and reduced by the gross
cost incurred in 2005 of $43.2m, to give a closing provision at December 31, 2005 of $496.8m. This represents the estimated gross cost of
asbestos for the next eight years, and is equivalent to $398.6m on a discounted basis, or £232.2m.

The rate used to discount the provision and insurance assets in 2005 was 5.30% (4.25%).
Insurance asset
The insurance asset of $26.1m at January 1, 2005 was reduced by insurance utilisation during the year of $11.5m, to give a closing insurance asset
at December 31, 2005 of $14.6m, equivalent to £7 .1m on a discounted basis.
Most of the US subsidiaries involved with asbestos claims have had agreements with their respective insurance carriers regarding the defence and
settlement of asbestos claims, the terms of which varied for each such subsidiary. These insurance arrangements have resulted in the insurance
companies having met substantially all of the amounts such subsidiaries have paid in the past in settlements and defence costs. More of these costs
are now being borne by the relevant subsidiaries as these arrangements are assumed, for accounts purposes, to be exhausted. 
In February 2006, one of the Company’s US subsidiaries reached a settlement with its insurers covering approximately 20% of the group’s present
asbestos costs. Details are provided in note 31.
Certain other US subsidiaries, not party to the recent settlement, continue to pursue litigation and negotiation to maximise the insurance cover
available. Litigation proceedings are progressing in the state of California with a view to establishing whether or not substantially all of the primary
cover available to one of our US subsidiaries has been exhausted and, to the extent that such cover has been exhausted, the amount of excess cover
that is available to it.
Deferred tax asset
The net cost of asbestos is deductible for US taxation at an estimated rate of 39%. At December 31, 2005, the deferred tax asset relating to the
discounted asbestos provision, net of insurance, was £87 .8m as shown in note 22.
Income statement
The net impact on the income statement, shown under discontinued items in note 9, was a charge of £13.7m. This consists of a discounted charge
after tax of £13.3m, as shown in the ‘Provided’ column of the above table, less the net impact of the discount unwind and change in discount rate
which was a charge of £0.4m after tax as shown in the ‘Discount’ column of the above table. 
Cash flow
The net cash flow impact, shown within net cash inflow from operating activities, was a net cash outflow of £10.6m shown in the ‘Utilised’ column of
the above table.

Risk factors
Factors which could cause actual results to differ from these estimates include: (i) adverse trends in the ultimate number of claimants filing asbestos
claims against the Company’s US subsidiaries; (ii) increases in the cost of resolving current and future asbestos claims as a result of adverse trends
relating to settlement and/or defence costs, dismissal rates, and/or judgment amounts; (iii) increases or decreases in the amount of insurance
available to cover asbestos claims; (iv) the emergence of new trends or legal theories that enlarge the number of potential claimants; (v) the impact
of bankruptcies of other defendant companies whose share of liability may be imposed on the Company’s US subsidiaries under certain state
liability laws; (vi) the unpredictable aspects of the US litigation process; (vii) adverse changes in the mix of asbestos-related diseases with respect to
which asbestos claims are made against the Company’s US subsidiaries; and (viii) potential legislative changes.
In light of such factors, the costs of the Company’s US subsidiaries involved in resolving asbestos claims may be materially different from current
estimates and consequently might have a material adverse effect on the Company’s consolidated financial condition, results of operations and cash
flow. However, assuming that current trends continue, the Company does not expect that such costs will have such a material adverse effect and,
even assuming a material deterioration in current trends, on the evidence available to it, the Company does not expect that such claims would
impact the ability of the Company to continue as a going concern.
Koppers’ liabilities
Koppers’ environmental obligations and related costs arise primarily from the US chemical and related operations formerly operated by Koppers
Company Inc, a company acquired by Beazer PLC which itself was acquired by the Company in 1991. Members of the Beazer group remain
contractually and statutorily liable for certain environmental costs relating to these discontinued operations. During 1998 an agreement was signed
under which, for a one-off premium and related transaction costs totalling $275.0m, insurance cover of $800.0m in perpetuity (after payment by
members of the Beazer group of the first $100.0m of remediation costs arising since January 1, 1998) was provided by subsidiaries of two
reinsurance companies, Centre Solutions and Swiss Re. 
At the end of 2005, $413.9m of the $800.0m insurance cover had been utilised. The estimate of future probable cost, discounted at 5.3% (5.1%),
is shown as a provision of £140.8m at December 31, 2005. These costs are the responsibility of the insurers and hence a receivable of £140.8m is
recorded at December 31, 2005 as shown in note 17 .
Based upon existing known circumstances, the Company considers that the remaining $386.1m of insurance cover should meet the related future
costs, recognising that the estimate of future probable costs could increase. Factors which could cause such remediation costs to increase include
(i) unknown adverse conditions arising at sites; (ii) third party claims in excess of estimates; (iii) changes to regulatory requirements; (iv) changes in
remediation techniques; and (v) any other significant variations to assumptions made in support of these estimates.
Other provisions
Long-term provisions have been discounted at rates of up to 6.25%.
Reclamation obligations have been established to cover those situations where members of the group have either a statutory or constructive
obligation to carry out remedial works. Reclamation provisions are expected to be utilised over the life of the relevant site. Legal, insurance,
environmental and other provisions relate to acquisitions, disposals and rationalisations both arising on acquisitions and provided for in current and
prior years. Legal, insurance, environmental and other provisions are expected to be utilised on a reducing basis over the next five years, depending
in each case on the nature of the underlying obligation.
Where appropriate, reclamation and environmental provisions have been established after taking into account the opinions of suitably qualified and
experienced consultants and after estimating the costs in line with current practice and standards.
22 Tax receivable/payable and deferred tax
Current and non-current tax receivable/payable includes expected taxes receivable/payable for tax filings and provisions for potential adjustments 
by tax authorities with respect to the tax filings in previous years. Examination of tax filings by tax authorities may last several years beyond the year 
of filing.

Own shares
On May 31, 1995 the group established an Employee Share Trust (the “Trust”) approved by shareholders on May 15, 1995. The Trust as at 
December 31, 2005 held 0.1m (1.0m) ordinary shares in Hanson at a book value of £0.5m (£4.0m). The Trust waived its rights to dividends payable
during the year and to its future dividends on its holding of ordinary shares. The cost of the Hanson Sharesave Scheme, where awards are 
granted at a discount to the market price of the Company’s shares, Share Option Plan and the Long T erm Incentive Plan, is charged to the income
statement. During the year, the group contributed £6.0m (£nil) to the Trust.
At December 31, 2005, 14,685,000 shares were held in treasury, none of which has the right to receive dividends. A further 3,565,000 shares 
were purchased by the Company to be held in treasury during the period January 1 to February 21, 2006. Pursuant to approval given by shareholders 
at the AGM held on April 20, 2005, as at December 31, 2005 the Company retains the authority to purchase a further 55,350,000 of its own 
shares up to the end of the AGM to be held in 2006. Details of shares purchased during the year are shown below:

Cash flow hedge reserve
Movements in the cash flow hedge reserve represent:
–changes in the fair value of cash flow hedges; 
– the recycling of the above changes through the income statement (totalling £3.7m since January 1, 2005), offsetting therein the impact of the
underlying hedged item; and 
– related deferred tax. 
The change in the fair value of derivatives in the cash flow hedge reserve in the period relates mainly to interest rate swaps with a maximum maturity
date of 2013 hedging floating rate debt. Underlying cash flows are therefore expected to occur until this date.
Cumulative translation reserve
Included within the foreign exchange adjustments of £56.8m (£(12.1)m) is foreign exchange of £0.1m (£(0.3m)) recycled through the income
statement on disposal of overseas operations.
Retained earnings
Included within the retained earnings balance of £1,655.5m (£1,402.8m) is £37 .6m (£(2.5)m) in respect of joint-ventures and associates of which
profit after tax for the current year of £43.2m (£2.0m) and dividends are £32.9m (£19.9m). The undistributed earnings of joint-ventures and
associates is £38.9m (£18.0m).
Other reserves
Other reserves represent merger reserves on acquisition of Pioneer International Limited of £216.3m, and £756.1m created on reduction of share
capital through the Scheme of Arrangement under Section 425 of the Companies Act.

Included in the goodwill recognised above are items that cannot be individually separated and reliably measured due to their nature. These include
new customers and synergy benefits.
For the period since acquisition, turnover of £143.8m and operating profit of £17 .1m in respect of the current year acquisitions is included within the
income statement as continuing operations. If the acquisitions had taken place at the beginning of the financial year, the continuing operating profit
of the group would have been £491.4m (£417 .0m) and turnover from continuing operations would have been £3,777 .9m (£3,581.5m).
The preliminary allocation of the purchase consideration to net assets and liabilities will be reviewed based on additional information up to December
31, 2006. The Directors do not anticipate that any net adjustments resulting from such reviews will have a material effect on the financial position or
results of Hanson’s operations. In respect of acquisitions in 2004, there were no material subsequent amendments to the preliminary allocations made.
Goodwill of £36.9m arising on current year acquisitions is deductible for tax purposes.
26 Contingent liabilities
Litigation relating to certain discontinued operations
Certain of the Company’s US subsidiaries, either directly or as a result of indemnity obligations, are the subject of claims or lawsuits both on an
individual and class action basis for bodily injury or property damage, relating to products incorporating asbestos, coal by-products and chemicals,
in particular for the wood treating industry.
Asbestos
The Company’s approach to accounting for the asbestos claims against its US subsidiaries is to provide for those costs of resolution which are both
probable and reliably estimable (refer note 21). The costs of resolving possible claims are disclosed as contingent liabilities. At present, based on
detailed analysis and the assumptions noted below, the provision for those costs which are both probable and reliably estimable equates to
approximately eight years of gross cost assuming an annual level of approximately US$60m. Whilst further claims are likely to be resolved beyond
this eight year period, the associated costs of resolution are not able to be reliably estimated and hence no provision has been made to cover these
possible liabilities.
Assumptions made in establishing the provision relate to the number, disease mix and location of future claimants, trends in dismissal rates,
settlement and defence costs, resolution of all existing claimants, time scale of resolution of new claimants, the continued solvency of co-defendants
and expected insurance recoveries. In light of the significant uncertainty associated with asbestos claims, there can be no guarantee that the
assumptions used to estimate the provision for the cost of resolving asbestos claims will be an accurate prediction of the actual costs that may be
incurred and as a result the provision will be subject to potential revision from time to time as additional information becomes available and to reflect
any changes in trends. Factors which could cause actual results to differ from these estimates include: (i) adverse trends in the ultimate number of
claimants filing asbestos claims against the Company’s US subsidiaries; (ii) increases in the cost of resolving current and future asbestos claims as
a result of adverse trends relating to settlement and/ or defence costs, dismissal rates, and/or judgement amounts; (iii) increases or decreases in
the amount of insurance available to cover asbestos claims; (iv) the emergence of new trends or legal theories that enlarge the number of potential
claimants; (v) the impact of bankruptcies of other defendant companies whose share of liability may be imposed on the Company’s US subsidiaries
under certain state liability laws; (vi) the unpredictable aspects of the US litigation process; (vii) adverse changes in the mix of asbestos-related
diseases with respect to which asbestos claims are made against the Company’s US subsidiaries; and (viii) potential legislative changes.
Notes to the accounts
101 26 Contingent liabilities continued
In light of such factors, the costs of the Company’s US subsidiaries involved in resolving asbestos claims may be materially different from current 
estimates and consequently might have a material adverse effect on the Company’s consolidated financial condition, results of operations and cash
flow. However, assuming that current trends continue, the Company does not expect that such costs will have such a material adverse effect and,
even assuming a material deterioration in current trends, on the evidence available to it, the Company does not expect that such claims would
impact the ability of the Company to continue as a going concern.
Details of asbestos claims against the Company’s US subsidiaries and the Company’s approach to provisioning (and the associated contingent
liabilities) are detailed in note 21. At December 31, 2005, approximately 131,350 claimants were outstanding. The amounts of compensation
formally claimed in the cases initially filed by these claimants vary but typically follow standard formulations that are used in various jurisdictions by
various plaintiffs’ law firms. Of the claimants outstanding as of December 31, 2005, Hanson estimates that approximately 52% do not specify a
dollar claim for damages, approximately 44% claim an amount “greater than US$25,000” and approximately 4% specify various amounts, typically
“greater than” specified amounts between US$50,000 and US$1m. Hanson is not aware of any claim specifying an amount greater than US$40m.
Hanson does not believe that the specific dollar amount mentioned in any claim is an accurate gauge of what relief, if any, the claimant may
eventually recover from one of Hanson’s US subsidiaries, and most claimants fail to allocate their alleged claims of liability amongst the various
named defendants.
Coal by-products and chemicals
These claims and lawsuits relate primarily to former US chemical products and operations, in particular those relating to the wood treating and coal 
tar derivative industries; products and operations which are unrelated to the group’s present business and activities. In such cases where one of the
Company’s subsidiaries is involved, there are often several potential defendants named in the claim or lawsuit. Since the demergers in 1996 no
settlements have been paid by, or judgments rendered against, any of the Company’s subsidiaries which have had or could have a material adverse
effect on the Company’s consolidated financial condition, results of operations or cash flow in connection with any such claims or lawsuits. In a
number of instances, the claim or lawsuit against the subsidiary has not been pursued and has been dismissed. With respect to those claims or
lawsuits that have been or are being pursued, the subsidiary concerned generally believes itself to have had or to have meritorious defences and
such claims and lawsuits have been and are being vigorously defended. 
The costs of defence and the amounts that are claimed by the plaintiffs, particularly in those lawsuits which involve numerous claimants, can be
significant with claims amounting to tens of millions of dollars. The unpredictable aspects of the US litigation process and the potential for juries to
award punitive damages mean that there is a possibility that the Company’s subsidiary may suffer at some stage a significant adverse verdict.
Insurance issues do arise on these claims and lawsuits, both in terms of settlement and defence coverage, the outcome of which can be uncertain.
In certain instances no insurance coverage may be available to the relevant subsidiary. The insurance cover referred to in note 21 relating to the
Koppers’ environmental obligations does not apply to the bodily injury claims and lawsuits described in this note, although it will address certain 
of the property damage claims. The cost relating to these claims is shown in note 21.
Other litigation
Several of the Company’s US subsidiaries are subject to litigation in California courts arising out of sand dredging operations on submerged lands
leased from the state of California. The litigation involves allegations that these subsidiaries underpaid royalties due under the leases and that sand
was dredged from state owned lands without authorisation. The litigation includes claims by the state of California under California statutes
providing for the recovery of treble damages and certain fines, penalties and attorney fees where the wrongful conduct involves false statements or
conversion of state owned property. A press release by the California Attorney General states that he is seeking damages of $200m, although the
complaint actually filed in court does not specify the amount of damages sought. Initial indications from the court regarding the interpretation of the
relevant leases have not served to clarify the situation and further submissions have been made by all parties involved. Whatever the ultimate ruling
of the court, the decision is likely to be appealed. Other issues raised by the Attorney General’s complaint have not yet been addressed and will be
vigorously defended. In light of the uncertainties involved in any litigation, no assurances or predictions can be made on the outcome of this litigation. 
Various subsidiaries of the Company are also the subject of a number of other pending legal proceedings. The Company does not anticipate that 
the outcome of these proceedings, either individually or in aggregate, will have a material adverse effect upon the Company’s consolidated financial
condition, results of operations or cash flow. However, in light of the uncertainties involved in any litigation and in particular in the USA, where there
is the added potential for punitive damage awards, there can be no guarantee that a settlement might have to be made by, or an unfavourable
judgement may be rendered against, the Company or one of its subsidiaries, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s
consolidated financial condition, results of operations or cash flow in connection with the above mentioned non-asbestos claims and lawsuits.
Demergers
In connection with the demergers, each of the four companies into which the Company demerged its respective businesses agreed to indemnify 
the Company against, among other things, the past, present and future obligations and liabilities of the businesses transferred to it on its respective
demerger while the Company agreed to indemnify each of these companies against, among other things, the past, present and future obligations
and liabilities of all other businesses owned or previously owned by the Company (including the businesses transferred to the other demerged
companies). Neither the Company nor any of its existing subsidiaries has incurred any liability in respect of a claim that related to the above-
mentioned businesses demerged by the Company, any such liability being borne by the relevant demerged company without liability to the
Company or any of its existing subsidiaries. The Energy Group PLC, one of the demerged companies, was acquired by TXU Corp. in 1998. In
November 2002, TXU Corp. announced that several of TXU Corp’s UK subsidiaries had been placed under the administration process in the UK,
including The Energy Group PLC. The Energy Group PLC itself is therefore unlikely to be able to fulfil its indemnification obligations to the Company
and its existing subsidiaries if and when required. The Company is, however, not aware of any claims against it or its subsidiaries that would give rise
to an indemnity obligation owed to the Company or its subsidiaries, on the part of The Energy Group PLC.
Bonds and guarantees
As at December 31, 2005 the group had contingent liabilities in respect of bank guarantees and performance bonds given to third parties
amounting to £20.3m (£19.3m), of which £0.2m (£0.2m) relates to former trading activities of the group; £99.7m (£81.6m) in surety bonds issued
primarily to US public authorities by US insurance companies in respect of reclamation liabilities of £51.6m (£42.1m), performance bonds of
£38.0m (£31.2m) and other surety obligations of £10.1m (£8.3m). The group’s bankers have also issued letters of credit of £91.4m (£78.5m),
primarily relating to environmental and restoration obligations and the deductible element of insurance programmes. Whilst the group holds
provisions (see note 21) for certain liabilities to which the bonds and guarantees relate, the liabilities under the bonds and guarantees are not
directly recorded on the consolidated balance sheet.

28 Pensions and other post-retirement benefits
i) Description of plans and details of cash contributions
Hanson has several funded defined benefit pension plans. The principal plans are in the UK and the USA. The benefits provided by these plans are
based primarily on years of credited service and final average pensionable pay as defined under the respective plan provisions. Hanson also
provides benefits from unfunded non-qualified plans in the USA and post-retirement employee welfare benefits in the USA and Canada.
The UK defined benefit plans were closed to new employees joining the group after July 2002 and a new defined contribution plan was established.
In the UK, the current level of employer contributions to the defined contribution plan ranges from 5-10% of pensionable salaries dependent on the
level of employee contribution. Other than for those employees covered by pre-existing collective bargaining arrangements, the US defined benefit
plan was closed to new employees joining the group after July 2005 and a new defined contribution plan was established. In the USA, the current
level of employer contributions to the defined contribution plan ranges from 3-6% of pensionable salaries dependent on the level of employee
contribution.
During 2005, the group continued with its own review of funding policy of the main UK and US defined benefit plans which built on the work carried
out in earlier years. The group continues to adopt a funding policy that targets the accrued benefit obligation, which is higher than applicable
statutory minimum funding levels in each country. Group companies, together with the relevant trustees of the various defined benefit plans, have 
a long-term goal of matching the liabilities of the defined benefit plans by investing in assets of an appropriate nature.
Contributions by the group totalled £59.1m in the year (2004: £57 .8m), principally in the UK, USA, Canada and Australia. This is represented by
regular contributions of £31.1m (2004: £38.0m) and additional contributions of £12.1m (2004: £8.4m) to defined benefit plans; contributions to
defined contribution plans of £12.1m (2004: £7 .6m); and contributions to multi-employer plans of £3.8m (2004: £3.8m) (multi-employer plans are
principally in the USA, and provide defined benefits to certain of the group’s union employees). Multi-employer plans are accounted for as defined
contribution schemes since it is not possible to isolate the individual components of the charge that relate to the group from the other employers that
participate in the plans. In addition to the ongoing regular contributions, group companies are scheduled to make additional payments of £8.4m in
each of the next three years (to the principal UK defined benefit plan). No conclusion has currently been reached on the level of contributions to
other plans. Contributions relating to multi-employer plans are based on negotiated collective bargaining agreements. The surpluses and deficits in
the multi-employer plans are not considered to have a material impact on the Company.

Overall the group expects to contribute at broadly the same level to its defined benefit pension plans in 2006 subject to maintaining plan funding at 
the accumulated benefit obligation (ABO) level in the USA and Canada. The contributions to the main defined benefit plan in the USA are expected 
to be lower than for 2005 as approximately 35% of the members of this plan elected to join the new defined contribution plan.

ii) Assumptions
To develop the expected long-term rate of return on assets assumptions, the group considered the current level of expected returns on risk-free
investments (primarily government bonds), the historical level of the risk premium associated with the other asset classes in which the portfolio is
invested and the expectations for future returns of each asset class. The expected return for each asset class was weighted based on the asset
allocation to develop the expected long-term rate of return on assets assumption for the portfolio, resulting in weighted average assumptions of 
5.6% for the UK and 6.75% for the USA at December 31, 2005. 
The major assumptions used to determine the liabilities on an IAS 19 basis for the principal US and UK defined benefit plans are set out below:
UK UK US US
2005 2004 2005 2004
% % % %
Discount rates at December 31 4.80 5.30 5.60 5.75
Future salary increases 4.25 4.50 4.25 4.25
Future pension increases 2.75 2.75 – –
Expected rate of return on plan assets:
Equity 7.00 7.25 8.00 8.00
Bonds 4.50 4.60 5.50 5.50
Property 7.00 7.25 8.00 8.00
Cash and other 5.00 5.00 5.00 5.00
Weighted average expected return across plans 5.60 5.70 6.75 7.00
Investigations have been carried out into the mortality experience of the major schemes in both the UK and the USA. These investigations concluded
that the current mortality assumptions retain prudent allowance for future improvements in longevity and therefore have been used in both 2005 and
2004. For the UK plans, the mortality table “PA(90) rated down 5 years” was used in retirement for current pensioners and PXA92 (C=2014) for 
future pensioners. In the USA, the mortality table “GAM83 series” was adopted in retirement for both current and future pensioners.
The current life expectancies underlying the value of the accrued liabilities for the principal UK and US defined benefit plans in 2005 and 2004 are:
UK US
Current pensioners (at age 65 – males) 18.0 16.7
Current pensioners (at age 65 – females) 22.5 21.3
Future pensioners (at age 65 – males) 19.3 16.7
Future pensioners (at age 65 – females) 22.3 21.3
Additional assumptions for post-retirement medical plans:
2005 2004
Annual increase in healthcare costs for US healthcare plans – initial 9.0% 10.0%
Annual increase in healthcare costs for US healthcare plans – ultimate 5.0% 5.0%

Notes to the accounts
105 29 Financial risk management
Exposure to liquidity, credit, and market price risk arises as a result of the day-to-day business activities of the group and the financing of those 
activities. Derivative financial instruments are used to hedge exposures to fluctuations in interest rates, foreign exchange rates, and commodity prices.
a) Funding and Liquidity Risk 
In addition to the high level of free cash flow of the group, Hanson operates a prudent approach to liquidity management using a mixture of long-term
debt together with short-term debt, cash and investments to meet its liabilities when due. This approach allows the group to respond quickly to
strategic market opportunities as they arise.
The group’s core funding is provided by two US$750m bonds maturing in September 2010 and March 2013 respectively. In addition the group holds
the following facilities: 
–A £500m revolving credit facility expiring in April 2010. In April 2005, Hanson entered into a five year £500m multi-currency revolving credit
facility arranged by Barclays Capital and J.P . Morgan plc with a syndicate of banks. This replaced a £519.2m facility due to expire in March
2006. The new facility contains a US$947m swingline advance facility and a sub-limit of up to £300m for Australian dollar loan note advances. 
–A US$475m syndicated credit facility expiring in July 2009. This facility is available to be drawn as either cash advances or standby letters of credit.
–T wo A$200m bilateral revolving credit facilities maturing in September 2006 and September 2007 .

2009 276.7 500.0
2010 500.0 –
b) Credit Risk
Credit risk represents the loss which Hanson would suffer if a counterparty failed to meet its contractual obligations. This is an inherent risk in the
day to day operations of the group.
The Board’s policy for mitigating credit risk is to enter into financial transactions with counterparties with a A-/A3 credit rating for long-term
transactions and F2/P-2/A2 for short-term transactions. In addition, each counterparty and country are allocated limits for cash and short-term
investments. Cash deposits and investments have a maximum term of three months.
At December 31, 2005 there were no significant risk weighted concentrations of credit risk. The maximum exposure under cash and short-term
investments to a single counterparty at December 31, 2005 represented no more than 17% of group cash and short term investments.
c) Market Risk
Market risk is the risk of loss arising from movements in market variables such as interest rates, exchange rates, and commodity prices. 
Market risk is incurred by Hanson as a result of borrowing to meet its financing obligations, by holding investments which earn interest, by operating
in currencies other than sterling and by purchasing commodities as inputs into its operations.
Ongoing monitoring of these risks is performed and risks are mitigated by utilising appropriate risk management products.
(i) Interest rate risk
The group’s policy on interest rate risk is designed to limit the group’s exposure to fluctuating interest rates. This is achieved by limiting the level of
floating interest rate exposure to a maximum determined by both the level of debt and the level of operating profit of the group at any point in time.
This approach, which is consistent with the group’s target for leverage, will mean, other things being equal, that for any given level of debt, a higher
level of operating profit will result in a higher limit on the level of floating rate debt in the group (and vice versa). Consistent with this policy, at
December 31, 2005 the group held 56% of net debt at fixed rates. Hanson uses interest rate swaps as part of fair value hedges, to swap fixed rate
debt into floating rates and as part of cash flow hedges to swap floating rate debt into fixed rates, in line with the policy described above. Derivatives
are classified separately in the balance sheet as an asset or liability as appropriate.

swapped to floating rates. 
(ii) Foreign exchange risk
Due to the nature of the group’s products, which are generally uneconomic to transport long distances, there are few foreign exchange transaction
exposures in the course of the group’s day-to-day business. The group does, however, have the majority (67 .9%) of its net assets in overseas locations
denominated in foreign currencies, principally US dollars (42.2% of its net assets). As a consequence, changes in exchange rates affect both reported
profit and asset values. The exposure of asset values to changes in foreign exchange rates is controlled to an extent by matching a proportion of currency
assets with currency liabilities using both debt and foreign exchange contracts. This means that falling overseas exchange rates will give rise to falling 
asset values and lower levels of net debt in sterling terms. The interest cost of currency liabilities also provides a partial hedge for foreign currency income.
The following table summarises the group’s net balance sheet currency exposure as at December 31, 2005:

(iii) Commodity price risk
Hanson is exposed to price risk on fuel and energy purchases in its operations. Commodity price risk is managed by a combination of physical supply
agreements and derivative instruments. Derivative transactions are typically recognised as non-designated hedge relationships.

(iv) Hedging
Hanson uses derivatives to mitigate market price risk. Hedges are classified into the following types:
Fair value hedges
For effective fair value hedges, the hedging instrument is recorded at fair value on the balance sheet, with changes in fair value being taken through
the income statement. The carrying amount of the hedged item is adjusted for gains and losses attributable to the risk being hedged. Hanson uses
fixed to floating interest rate swaps to hedge US$500m of each of the US$750m fixed rate bonds outstanding. In addition, the group hedges
£199.8m of fixed rate bank debt with interest rate swaps.
Cash flow hedges
For cash flow hedges, the fair value of the hedge is carried on the balance sheet. The hedged item is either held off-balance sheet or recorded at
historic or amortised cost, depending upon the type of transaction. For effective hedges, changes in the fair value of the hedging instrument are
taken to equity. They are then recycled through the income statement in the period during which the hedged item impacts the income statement.
Included in the group’s cash flow hedges are US$250m and A$250m of floating to fixed interest rate swaps hedging short-term floating rate borrowings.
The maximum length of time over which the variability in future cash flows of forecast transactions, excluding floating rate borrowings, are hedged is under
one year.
Net investment hedges
The group holds forward exchange contracts as hedges of its foreign currency investments. The value of such contracts is set out in the currency
exposure table in section c) (ii) of this note.
Non-designated hedges
As IFRS has stringent rules under which hedge accounting may be applied, it is not considered practicable to apply hedge accounting for a small
number of hedges (including hedges of commodities). Such hedges are deemed non-designated under IAS 39 and are recognised at fair value on
the balance sheet with changes in their fair value being recognised immediately through the income statement.
The amount of hedge ineffectiveness during the year was not significant.
d) Fair value of financial instruments
Fair value is the amount for which an asset could be exchanged, or a liability settled, between knowledgeable, willing parties on an arm’s length
basis. For financial instruments carried at fair value, market prices or rates are used to determine fair value where an active market exists. Hanson
uses forward prices for valuing forward foreign exchange and commodity contracts and uses swap models with present value calculations based on
market yield curves to value interest rate swaps. For short-term assets and liabilities the carrying amount is approximate to their fair value. 
All derivative financial assets and liabilities are shown at fair value on the balance sheet. Under IAS 39 hedge accounting rules, only the portions 
of the two US$750m bonds which form part of an effective fair value hedge are shown at fair value in the balance sheet. The fair value of bonds at
December 31, 2005 was £940.4m (£878.4m at 31 December 2004), compared to their carrying value of £889.7m as at December 31, 2005.

As described in note 1, Accounting policies, this is the first year that the group has applied IAS 32 and IAS 39. Comparative data for 2004, in the
tables above, has been reproduced from the 2004 Annual Report and presented under UK GAAP (Financial Reporting Standard 13). This analysis
is set out more fully below.
The group’s policy is to hedge the following exposures:
– interest rate risk – using currency swaps and, or interest rate swaps 
– foreign exchange risk – using forward foreign currency contracts. 
The effects of any interest rate hedges are recognised over the life of the hedge. Foreign exchange hedges are evaluated against the closing 
exchange rate at the balance sheet date and the resultant gain or loss is matched with that of the underlying asset or liability in the accounts. 
As a result, the unrecognised gain or loss is a function of market rates at the balance sheet date and is not indicative of gains or losses which 
will be recognised in future accounting periods.

The amounts in the above table are shown after taking account of currency and interest rate swaps undertaken to manage the interest rate exposure 
of the group. It also includes the principal amount of any forward exchange contracts undertaken to manage the translation exposure of the net
assets of overseas subsidiaries.
In the table above, fixed rate US dollar liabilities represent the $681.6m of the $750m bond repayable on September 15, 2005 and $250m of the
$750m bond due September 27 , 2010. The fixed rate liabilities in Australian dollars represent the net notional principal of interest rate swaps.
Interest rate swaps starting at dates in the future are included in the weighted average period, but excluded from the weighted average rate. Floating
rate financial assets comprise cash deposits, the receivable element of forward exchange contracts and commercial paper. The majority of floating
rate financial assets and liabilities bear interest based on the equivalents of LIBOR.
The group has taken advantage of the FRS 13 exemption to exclude current receivables and payables from this note. Also excluded is the Koppers’
liability and other discounted provisions which are accounted for at a discount rate of 5.1%. These are all non interest bearing.

31 Subsequent events
On January 30, 2006, Hanson announced that it had completed the acquisition of PaverModule, Inc., a supplier of concrete pavers in Florida, USA, 
and Red Bank Manufacturing Company Limited, a producer of terracotta clay and concrete products in Derbyshire, UK for a total consideration of
approximately £60.0m.
On January 31, 2006, the operations of Seagoe, a drainage business based in Northern Ireland, classified as held for sale at December 31, 
2005, was sold.
On February 13, 2006, Hanson announced that one of its US subsidiaries, responsible for approximately 20% of the group’s present asbestos 
costs, had reached a settlement with its insurers. The settlement is effective from January 1, 2006 and resolves a number of issues relating to 
historic insurance policies which provided insurance cover for a range of claims, including those relating to asbestos. 
Under the settlement, the subsidiary will pay the first $35.0m of its future asbestos costs, which the subsidiary estimates will be paid over
approximately three years. Thereafter, the subsidiary’s asbestos costs will be paid in full by the insurance carriers up to agreed, and undisclosed, 
limits. These limits, assuming they are not used for non-asbestos claims, are expected to provide asbestos insurance cover for this subsidiary well
beyond 2020. As detailed in note 21, the group’s total cost of asbestos, before tax, is estimated to average approximately $60.0 million per annum
over the next eight years. Based on these estimates, this settlement would reduce the net cost by 20% to $48.0 million per annum, after 2008.
32 Restatement for first-time adoption of IFRS
For periods up to and including the year ended December 31, 2004, the group prepared its financial statements in accordance with UK generally 
accepted accounting practice (UK GAAP). These financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2005 are the first the group is required to
prepare in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted by the European Union.
The significant accounting policies are set out in note 1. In preparing these financial statements, the group has started from an opening balance
sheet as at January 1, 2004 (the group’s date of transition to IFRS), and made those changes in accounting policies and other restatements
required by IFRS 1 for the first-time adoption of IFRS. The group has taken advantage of the exemption not to restate comparatives for IAS 32
“Financial Instruments: Disclosure and Presentation” (IAS 32) and IAS 39 “Financial Instruments: Recognition and measurement” (IAS 39) but to
apply these standards from January 1, 2005. 
This note explains the principal adjustments made by the group in restating its UK GAAP consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2004 and
January 1, 2005, together with its consolidated income and cash flow statements for the year ended December 31, 2004 against its previously
published UK GAAP financial statements.
The group issued a press release providing detailed guidance on the group’s preliminary restatement at January 1, 2004 and December 31, 2004
from UK GAAP to IFRS on June 2, 2005. There is a change from the preliminary restatement in relation to the January 1 and December 31, 2004 for
deferred tax balances. This relates primarily to a change in the interpretation in accounting for IAS 12 “Income taxes” regarding the tax bases of
depreciable assets that can be recognised in calculating deferred tax, as well as certain other temporary difference adjustments. The impact is to
decrease the deferred tax liability at December 31, 2004 by £0.5m; decrease the deferred tax asset at December 31, 2004 by £32.8m; and
increase the tax charge on continuing operations before impairments for the year ended December 31, 2004 by £51.3m. 
Since the preliminary restatements, certain other amounts have been reclassified to conform with current period presentation. There is no change 
to the UK GAAP reported numbers for the year ended December 31, 2004 and previous years.
Exemptions applied
IFRS 1 “First-time Adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards” permits companies adopting IFRS for the first time to take advantage 
of certain optional and mandatory exemptions from applying IFRS with full retrospective effect in the transition period. 
Hanson PLC has elected to take advantage of the following exemptions in its adoption of IFRS:
– Business combinations: The group has elected not to restate business combinations on an IFRS basis prior to the date of transition, other than to
adjust the carrying value of goodwill to reclassify separately identifiable intangible assets previously reported within that goodwill at date of transition;
– Property, plant and equipment: The group has elected not to measure property, plant and equipment at their fair values at the date of transition
to IFRS and not to use those fair values as their deemed cost;
– Employee benefits: All cumulative actuarial gains and losses have been recognised in equity on transition to IFRS. The group will continue 
to apply this treatment, with all actuarial gains and losses being recognised in the statement of recognised income and expense;
– Cumulative translation differences: IAS 21 “The Effect of Changes in Foreign Exchange Rates” requires that on the disposal of a foreign
operation, the cumulative amount of exchange differences recognised within equity for the retranslation of that operation be recognised within
the income statement as part of the profit or loss on disposal. The group has adopted the exemption which allows these cumulative exchange
differences to be set to zero at the date of transition. Had the group not taken advantage of this exemption, the impact on transition to IFRS
would have been in line with the principles explained in the group’s US GAAP reconciliation;
– Financial instruments: The group has taken advantage of the exemption not to restate its comparative financial information for IAS 32 “Financial
Instruments: Disclosure and Presentation” and IAS 39 “Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement” but to apply these standards
from January 1, 2005. As a result, the comparative information is presented in line with UK GAAP as previously stated. A reconciliation of the
impact on equity of adopting IAS 32 and IAS 39 in 2005 is provided below. On adoption of IAS 39, the group has elected to designate existing
financial instruments as a financial asset or financial liability at their fair value on January 1, 2005, the date of transition. The impact of applying
IAS 39 on a retrospective basis and not taking advantage of this exemption would have been similar to principles explained in the group’s US
GAAP reconciliation apart from the impact of US GAAP transition rules; 
– Share-based payments: The group has taken advantage of the exemption to apply IFRS 2 “Share-based Payment” only to awards made after
November 7 , 2002 which have not vested at January 1, 2005. Had the group not applied this elective exemption, then the impact of adopting
IFRS 2 would have been similar to the pro forma information provided for FAS 123 “Share-based payments” under US GAAP .

Notes to the accounts
110 32 Restatement for first-time adoption of IFRS continued
The group has complied with the following mandatory exemptions on adoption of IFRS:
– Estimates – The group’s estimates under IFRS at the date of transition to IFRS are consistent with estimates made at the same date
under UK GAAP;
– Assets classified as held for sale and discontinued operations – The group has applied the requirements of IFRS 5 “Non-current Assets Held
for Sale and Discontinued Operations” on a prospective basis from January 1, 2004, applying the transitional requirements of the standard;
– Financial instruments – The group has applied the derecognition requirements of IAS 39 on a prospective basis for transactions occurring on
or after January 1, 2005. As required under IAS 39, the group has measured all its derivatives for which hedge accounting is applied, at fair
value and has eliminated all deferred losses and gains arising on derivatives reported under UK GAAP .

Explanation of IFRS adjustments 
A summary of the significant differences between UK GAAP and IFRS and the impact to the group is as follows:
a) Goodwill and intangible assets 
Principal difference: Under UK GAAP , goodwill was capitalised and amortised through the income statement over its estimated economic life,
usually assumed to be no more than 20 years. Under IFRS, goodwill is no longer amortised, but is frozen at the UK GAAP carrying value at the
transition date and subjected to an annual impairment test. IFRS requires that negative goodwill is recognised in the income statement as it arises.
UK GAAP required acquired intangible assets to be capitalised where they could be reliably measured and amortised over their economic life. IFRS
stipulates that intangible assets should be capitalised where they are separable from the entity or arise from contractual or other legal rights.
Under UK GAAP and IFRS, certain separable intangible assets are required to be capitalised and amortised over their useful economic life and
under IFRS, such assets are classified apart from goodwill (although within the intangible asset category). 
Transition impact (as at January 1, 2004): Negative goodwill with a carrying value of £0.5m has been transferred to reserves. Intangible assets,
previously recognised within the goodwill balance, with a carrying value of £7 .8m, have been separately identified within intangible assets. 
Income statement impact (for the year ended December 31, 2004): The goodwill amortisation change of £48.7m recorded under UK GAAP has
been reversed. In addition, the amortisation charge of £3.9m relating to goodwill held within joint-ventures and associates has been written back to
the income statement. A charge of £2.0m has been recorded in respect of the amortisation of intangible assets recognised under IFRS which were
not separately recognised under UK GAAP .
Balance sheet impact (as at December 31, 2004): Goodwill and intangible assets have increased by £51.3m, consisting of the 2004 amortisation
charge reversal of £48.7m; a write back of the negative goodwill at January 1, 2004 of £0.5m; less £1.8m (net of a foreign exchange impact of
£0.2m) for the amortisation of intangible assets; and adding back goodwill amortisation of £3.9m for goodwill held within joint-ventures and associates. 
Goodwill has also been tested for impairment, for the year ended December 31, 2004 and at the IFRS transition date of January 1, 2004, in
accordance with IFRS. An adjustment of £1.4m to operating impairments, shown within joint-ventures’ and associates’ impairments of £21.9m, was
required to reflect the impact on the carrying value of goodwill of reversing amortisation in 2004 (see section f) ‘Joint-ventures and associates’ below).
b) Pensions and other post-retirement benefits
Principal difference: Under UK GAAP , the group provided for the cost of pension and other post-retirement benefits over employee service lives in
accordance with SSAP 24 “Accounting for pension costs” . The group also provided additional disclosures under FRS 17 “Retirement benefits”
based on the valuation methodologies required by the standard. IAS 19 “Employee Benefits” takes a similar valuation approach to FRS 17 , requiring
the surplus or deficit relating to defined benefit post-retirement schemes to be recognised directly at fair value on the group’s balance sheet. IAS 19
permits entities to recognise the effects of any movements in the surpluses or deficits immediately in reserves, in common with FRS 17 , or to
introduce these movements gradually, using a corridor approach. Hanson has adopted the same treatment that is required under FRS 17 .
Like FRS 17 , IAS 19 requires the service cost element of pensions and other post-retirement benefit plans to be recognised separately from the
financing elements. The net financing charge includes the impact of the unwinding of the discount on the schemes’ liabilities in the current year and
the expected return on the schemes’ assets. Under IAS 19, Hanson has shown the service cost within operating profit and the net finance charge as
part of finance costs. Under SSAP 24, both elements were included within operating profit. 
Under UK GAAP , an asset or liability in respect of pension and post-retirement medical schemes was reported on the balance sheet to the extent
that the timing of any payments differed from the charge or credit reported for the period. IFRS requires that pensions and other post-retirement
benefit plan assets are carried at their fair value and plan liabilities are carried at their present value at the balance sheet date.
Transition impact (as at January 1, 2004): A provision for employee benefit deficits of £139.6m has been recognised at the transition date, which
replaces provisions of £121.1m previously recognised under UK GAAP . The pension prepayment (reported within trade and other receivables
under UK GAAP) of £199.6m has also been derecognised on transition to IFRS. The overall impact is a reduction in total equity of £218.1m 
on transition.
Income statement impact (for the year ended December 31, 2004): Under UK GAAP the group recorded a pension charge of £36.9m and a
charge relating to other post-retirement benefits of £4.1m totalling £41.0m within operating profit. Under IFRS, the group has reflected a total 
2004 charge of £37 .6m, representing an operating charge of £49.6m and a net financing credit of £12.0m. Accordingly, Hanson has reduced its
operating profit by £8.6m and reported income of £12.0m within net finance costs. A deferred tax charge of £0.9m has been recognised in 2004 
in respect of the additional pension charge, which is included within the total taxation adjustment (c) explained below. 
Balance sheet impact (as at December 31, 2004): The closing balance sheet prepayment under UK GAAP is £204.9m and the closing balance
sheet provision is £114.2m. Under IFRS, the prepayment is written off and the provision is increased by £14.7m, taking the pension provision to
£48.5m and post-retirement medical schemes provision to £80.4m, totalling £128.9m. This represents the pre-tax deficit on the group’s schemes
at the balance sheet date and comprises the total of the deficits recognised at the transition date above, adjusted for the charge recognised in the
year, cash payments in the period and actuarial gains and losses totalling £7 .5m.
c) Taxation
Principal difference
The scope of deferred tax under IAS 12 is wider than under UK GAAP . Under IFRS, deferred tax is required to be provided on all temporary
differences; that is, the difference between the carrying value of assets and liabilities included in the financial statements and the basis of those
assets and liabilities for tax purposes. Under UK GAAP , deferred tax is provided on timing differences that have not reversed at the balance sheet
date; that is, items (e.g. pensions) which, for tax purposes, are taxable or deductible in periods different from those in which they are accounted 
for in the financial statements. UK GAAP prohibits recognition of deferred tax on certain timing differences defined in the standard.
Transition impact (as at January 1, 2004)
The deferred tax opening balance has increased by £257 .2m. This is primarily due to liabilities arising on temporary differences in respect of historic
UK and US mineral reserve revaluations for which there is a requirement to provide deferred tax under IFRS but which were not previously required
to be provided for under UK GAAP .
Income statement impact (for the year ended December 31, 2004)
In 2004, under UK GAAP , a deferred tax credit of £18.7m was recognised. Under IFRS, an additional deferred tax credit of £19.6m has been
recognised. This principally relates to the change in the deferred tax liability balances with respect to the mineral reserves as well as the write-up, 
for Australian tax purposes, of Australian assets under a recently introduced Australian tax consolidation regime.
Closing balance sheet impact
At December 31, 2004, a deferred tax asset of £1.9m was recognised together with an increase in the deferred tax liability of £223.4m compared
to the UK GAAP liability of £111.5m. This is principally a result of the increased deferred tax liability in respect of mineral reserves net of deferred tax
benefits recognised on the write-up in Australian assets, for Australian tax purposes, under a new Australian tax consolidation regime.

d) Dividends
Principal difference: Under UK GAAP , dividends are recognised in the period to which they relate. In practice this means that the group accrues for
the final dividend proposed. Under IFRS, dividends are recognised in the period in which they are declared and approved. In practice, this results in
the final dividend for the year being recognised in the following year, since this is when it is declared and approved. 
Transition impact (as at January 1, 2004): No accrual is required for the 2003 final dividend of £84.5m, since this was declared and paid in 2004.
As a result, the accrual for this dividend is not recognised on transition.
Income statement impact (for the year ended December 31, 2004): The final 2004 dividend of £93.4m approved by shareholders in 2005 has
been credited to the 2004 income statement and increased by the final 2003 dividend approved in 2004 of £84.5m. The net impact of this
adjustment is a £8.9m credit to retained profit.
Balance sheet impact (as at December 31, 2004): No accrual is required for the 2004 final dividend of £93.4m, since this was declared and 
paid in 2005. 
e) Provisions 
Principal difference: Under UK GAAP , the group’s restoration obligation provisions are discounted by applying a market assessed discount rate to
increases in its estimated obligation recognised each period, IFRIC 1 “Changes in Existing Decommissioning, Restoration and Similar Liabilities”
requires the group to apply the current market assessed discount rate to the whole obligation.
Transition impact (as at January 1, 2004): On transition to IFRS, the group has increased its restoration obligations as a result of this change in
policy by £17 .4m. This has resulted in an increase in the group’s assets of £5.5m directly as a result of the change in discount rates. The net impact
of these adjustments on equity is £11.9m. 
Income statement impact (for the year ended December 31, 2004): This has resulted in an increase to financing costs of £2.1m and an increase 
in depreciation of £0.1m in the year. 
Balance sheet impact (as at December 31, 2004): The change has resulted in an overall increase in provisions of £14.8m and an additional asset
of £1.8m. The change is due to the additional financing cost and depreciation charge during the period and has a net impact on equity of £13.0m. 
f) Joint-ventures and associates
Principal difference: Under UK GAAP , Hanson uses the gross equity method of consolidation to account for its share of its joint-ventures’ results
and assets and liabilities, which it presents on two separate lines in its balance sheet. It uses the equity method to account for its share of its
associates’ results and net assets. Under IFRS, Hanson has elected to apply the equity method to both its joint-ventures and associates. This has
had no impact on net profit, but requires that the group’s share of profit from joint-ventures and associates is disclosed after finance costs and tax.
This has been disclosed in the Consolidated income statement after group operating profit and before operating profit before impairments.
The group’s joint-ventures and associates are required to adopt IFRS for the purposes of reporting to Hanson and the adjustment below reflects the
impact that this has had on the group’s share of their profit after tax. 
Impact: The adoption of IFRS by the group’s joint-ventures and associates increases the share of their profits by £0.9m before an additional
impairment charge of £1.4m, giving a net £0.5m reduction in profit after tax.
Operating profit before impairments increases by £8.9m due to the £0.9m above and £8.0m of reclassifications. The reclassifications consist of an
add back of £20.5m of impairments (shown separately below operating profit before impairments) and a deduction of £3.2m of finance costs and
£9.3m of tax which are shown within the joint-ventures and associates’ column.
g) Share-based payments
Principal difference: Hanson operates a number of share-based incentive schemes. Under UK GAAP , it recognises the cost of these over the
performance period, based on the number of awards expected to vest and their cost (calculated on an intrinsic value method) to the group. Under
IFRS 2 “Share-based Payment” , an expense is recognised in the profit and loss account for share-based awards expected to vest over their
performance period, based on the fair value of equity instruments granted at the date of the award. Black Scholes, Binomial and Monte Carlo
simulation models are used, as appropriate, to calculate the IFRS 2 fair value at the date the award is granted. The charge to the income statement
under IFRS 2 is only calculated on awards made after November 7 , 2002 as a result of the transition option applied by the group.
Transition impact (as at January 1, 2004): The opening liability for cash-settled awards of £0.4m has been reclassified from retained earnings
where it was recorded under UK GAAP . As under UK GAAP , IFRS required that movement in the cumulative income statement charge and
utilisation for equity-settled schemes is shown as a reserve movement within equity. This results in no impact to the opening balance sheet for
equity-settled awards. 
Income statement impact (for the year ended December 31, 2004): The application of IFRS 2 has resulted in a credit for 2004 of £0.1m against
costs and overheads disclosed within operating profit.
Balance sheet impact (as at December 31, 2004): The cash-settled liability recorded in the balance sheet is £0.3m as a result of an income
statement credit of £0.1m. As the net income statement charge for equity-settled schemes as a result of the transition to IFRS is £nil in 2004, the
overall impact on equity reserves as a result of the transition to IFRS is also £nil. A deferred tax asset of £3.6m has been recognised in respect of
future tax deductions.
h) Minority interest
Principal difference: Under UK GAAP the group did not disclose the share of profits and losses of minority interests separately on the face of the
income statement or balance sheet on grounds of immateriality. Hanson has made this disclosure on the face of the income statement and balance
sheet under IFRS to highlight to the reader that the group has minority shareholders in certain of its subsidiaries.
Impact: The group has reclassified £2.7m at January 1, 2004 from trade and other payables, £0.1m as a loss attributable to minority interest from
costs and overheads within the income statement for the year ended December 31, 2004, and £2.1m at December 31, 2004 from trade and other
payables to minority interest. 
i) Reclassifications and other items
i) Under UK GAAP the group discloses asset impairments as exceptional items within operating profit. UK GAAP requires that material items
which are unusual by virtue of size or incidence must be disclosed as exceptional, where this is necessary to show a true and fair view. Under IFRS,
Hanson has changed the format of its income statement and as a result, the group has disclosed some of its UK GAAP operating exceptional items
in a separate “operating impairments” line. IFRS is less prescriptive than UK GAAP regarding income statement formats; however, IAS 1 still
encourages entities to disclose additional lines on the face of the income statement to assist the reader in understanding the entity’s financial
performance. As such, impairment charges have been reclassified from costs and overheads to operating impairments, increasing operating profit
before impairments by £29.3m. Changes to the disclosure of impairments relating to joint-ventures and associates are described in section (f)
‘Joint-ventures and associates’ above. Notes to the accounts
117
32 Restatement for first-time adoption of IFRS continued
ii) UK GAAP required that profits/losses on the sale of fixed assets and investments and on the sale and termination of operations were shown 
separately on the face of the income statement as exceptional items, where these were material. As noted above, IFRS is less prescriptive regarding
income statement formats. It requires key elements relating to discontinued operations to be disclosed separately from continuing operations,
highlighting the results of discontinued operations and the profit or loss on disposal of the operation. These amounts are disclosed after tax and are
included separately in Hanson’s income statement below profit after taxation. In order to aid the reader’s understanding of the group’s performance,
the profits and losses on disposal of operations are split between those relating to current year disposals and additional profits and losses relating
to disposals which took place in previous periods. This latter category includes charges in respect of increases to the group’s asbestos provision. 
This has resulted in operating profit after impairments being reduced by £1.1m due to two reclassifications. Current year profit after tax from
operations discontinued in the year of £1.9m has been reclassified from turnover, costs and overheads, operating profit and taxation into a new
section of the income statement showing discontinued operations. This has resulted in a reduction in turnover of £28.8m and a reduction in costs
and overheads of £26.9m.
Profits on sale of fixed assets of £0.8m disclosed within non-operating exceptional items have been reclassified to costs and overheads.
The resulting exceptional profits and losses on the disposal of discontinued operations have then been analysed into disposals which have taken
place in the current period and costs incurred relating to disposals in previous periods. Exceptional tax gains and losses of £38.0m have been
reclassified from taxation to form part of the profit or loss on disposal of the operation to which they relate. A credit of £39.1m is recorded against
‘Profit/loss from prior year’s disposals’ and a charge of £1.1m is reclassified to ‘Profit/loss on current year’s disposals’ . The total loss due to
discontinued operations decreases by £38.8m as a result of the above reclassifications plus an additional net loss of £0.3m explained in paragraph
iii) below. 
Profits on the disposal of fixed assets investments of £1.0m have been reclassified from non-operating exceptional items to profit/loss on current
year disposals.
iii) Cumulative translation exchange losses of £24.7m arising in the year have been reclassified from retained earnings to the cumulative
translation reserve as at December 31, 2004. As permitted by IFRS 1, this reserve was set to £nil on January 1, 2004 and the cumulative foreign
exchange amount for 2004 has been transferred into the cumulative translation reserve. This has had no impact on net assets. Under IFRS,
cumulative exchange differences are taken into the calculation of the profit or loss on the sale of a business to which they relate. UK GAAP does not
require these to be taken into account. An amount of £0.3m of cumulative exchange losses has been reclassified from the cumulative translation
reserve to profit/loss on current year’s disposals which forms part of discontinued operations in the income statement.
iv) An element of the group’s capitalised software with a net carrying value of £2.2m has been reclassified from property, plant and equipment
under UK GAAP to intangible assets in accordance with IFRS as at January 1, 2004. At December 31, 2004, this balance is £3.3m.
v) Goodwill with a net carrying value of £27 .0m held within goodwill under UK GAAP , has been reclassified to investment in joint-ventures and
associates. In addition, the transition of the group’s joint-ventures and associates to IFRS has resulted in an increase in the group’s investment of
£0.9m, increasing the group’s investment in joint-ventures and associates by £27 .9m in total.
vi) IFRS requires provisions, creditors and debtors which are expected to be settled within one year from the balance sheet date to be classified
as current liabilities. Long-term creditors with a value of £31.9m have been reclassified from short-term to long-term creditors under IFRS. Long-
term debtors of £47 .2m have been reclassified from ‘Trade and other receivables’ to ‘Long-term receivables’ which are partially offset by a
reclassification of £50.3m long-term debtors being reclassified to ‘Trade and other receivables’ . The portion of provisions expected to be settled
within one year has been disclosed separately and includes a reclassified amount of £99.7m. In addition, the Koppers’ insurance asset and liabilities
have been included within long-term receivables and provisions on the face of the balance sheet.
j) Explanation of IFRS adjustments to the balance sheet on January 1, 2005
The group adopted IAS 32 “Financial Instruments: Disclosure and Presentation” (IAS 32) and IAS 39 “Financial Instruments: Recognition and
Measurement” (IAS 39) on January 1, 2005, having taken advantage of the exemption not to restate comparatives for IAS 32 and 39. The impact of
the opening balance sheet adjustments as a result of this change in accounting policy are shown in the reconciliation of the consolidated IFRS
balance sheet at that date. The principal differences are explained as follows:
Previously, derivative financial instruments (derivatives) were not required to be recognised on the balance sheet at fair value where they were
hedging a defined financial risk (i.e. the derivative was part of a hedge relationship). Under IAS 39, the requirements for defining a hedge
relationship (relating to designation, documentation and effectiveness testing) are more strictly defined and all derivatives are measured at fair value.
Unless a derivative is part of an IFRS compliant hedge relationship, any changes in its fair value must be recognised directly in the income
statement. IAS 39 recognises three areas in which derivatives may be used as part of a hedge relationship: fair value, cash flow and net investment
hedges. Determination of hedge accounting treatment is dependent on this classification.
The group’s hedging strategy remains unchanged and as far as practicable, hedge accounting has been applied under IFRS. The group considers
all of its derivatives to be hedges of financial risks, categorised as follows:
i) Fair value hedges
The group uses interest rate swaps to hedge the group’s exposure to changes in the fair value of fixed rate debt as a result of interest rate
movements. Under IFRS the interest on such swaps is accrued on an effective interest basis. The carrying amount of the hedged item is adjusted for
gains and losses attributable to the risk being hedged. For effective hedges, changes in the fair values of both the hedge and the portion of the
hedged item covered by the hedge are recognised in the income statement. If a hedge becomes ineffective, the hedged item ceases to be
remeasured for subsequent changes in fair value. Instead, the portion of its carrying value relating to previous changes in fair value is amortised over
its remaining life. Under UK GAAP , the hedged item was recorded at historic cost, with the hedging instrument typically being held off-balance
sheet. Interest on such swaps was calculated by reference to coupon rates on a straight line basis.
ii) Cash flow hedges
When accounting for cash flow hedges under IFRS only the fair value of the hedging instrument is recorded on the balance sheet. The hedged item
is either held off-balance sheet or recorded at historic or amortised cost, depending upon the type of underlying transaction. Changes in the fair
value of the hedging instrument are taken to equity where they are recycled through the income statement in the same period during which the
hedged item impacts the income statement. Although under UK GAAP the hedged item is also either held off-balance sheet or recorded at historic
cost, the hedging instrument is also typically held off-balance sheet.
iii) Net investment hedges
The group uses forward exchange contracts to hedge foreign currency investments. Under IFRS, the change in the spot exchange rate element of
the forward exchange contracts is designated against the net investment in overseas investments, as was previously the case under UK GAAP .
iv) Non-designated hedges
As IFRS has more stringent rules, under which hedge accounting may be applied, it was not considered practicable to try to obtain hedge
accounting for a small number of relatively low volume hedges (including hedges of commodities). Such hedges are deemed non-designated and
are recognised at fair value on the balance sheet with changes in their fair value being recognised immediately through the income statement. Notes to the accounts continued

33 US accounting information
a) Comparison of International and US accounting principles
From January 1, 2005, as required by the European Union’s IAS Regulation, the group has prepared its Annual Report and Form 20-F in accordance
with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted by the European Union (EU), which differ in certain respects from US generally
accepted accounting principles (US GAAP). These differences relate principally to the following items, and the effect of each of the adjustments to
profit for the financial year and net equity that would be required to US GAAP , is set out below. 
IFRS as adopted by the EU differ in certain respects from IFRS as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB). However, the
consolidated financial statements for the periods presented would be no different had the Company applied IFRS as issued by the IASB.
References to IFRS hereafter should be construed as references to IFRS as adopted by the EU.
As a result of the group’s transition to IFRS on January 1, 2004, the reconciliations of net income and net equity for 2004 published in previous
periods have been restated to reflect the restated profit and net equity reported within the Consolidated Income statement and Consolidated
Balance Sheet. 
Under the IFRS transition provisions within the Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) Form 20-F requirements, the group is permitted to
provide two years of comparable financial information under IFRS and reconciliations to US GAAP for the periods presented. In addition, the group
is providing three years of certain comparable financial information under US GAAP and selected financial US GAAP information for five years.
Intangible assets
i) Goodwill
Under IFRS, goodwill arising on acquisitions completed prior to January 1, 1998 was written off directly to reserves. From December 31, 1997 to
January 1, 2004, all acquired goodwill was capitalised and amortised over a period not exceeding 20 years. Since January 1, 2004, goodwill
continues to be capitalised, however, amortisation of goodwill ceased at that date. On disposal of a business, the profit or loss on disposal is
determined including goodwill reported as part of intangible assets. Under US GAAP prior to January 1, 2002, goodwill arising on acquisitions prior
to July 1, 2001, was capitalised and amortised over its estimated useful life, not exceeding 40 years. Under the transition provisions of SFAS 142
“Goodwill and other intangible assets” , goodwill, which arose during the period subsequent to July 1, 2001, was capitalised, but has not been
amortised. From January 1, 2002, goodwill is no longer amortised, but is reviewed annually for impairment. 
ii) Other intangible assets
Since January 1, 2002, separately identified intangible assets arising on acquisitions have been capitalised and amortised over their useful lives of
between 1 and 27 years under US GAAP . Separately identified intangible assets recognised since transition to IFRS have been amortised on the
same basis as under US GAAP .
iii) Capitalised software
Under IFRS, computer software which is deemed not to be integral to the computer hardware is capitalised as part of intangible assets.
Under US GAAP , the balances are reclassified into property, plant and equipment.
Impairment of goodwill
Under IFRS, goodwill is reviewed for potential impairment where there is an indication that an impairment may have occurred. The impairment is
measured by comparing the carrying value of goodwill for each cash generating unit (CGU) with the higher of the net realisable value and the value
in use. Under US GAAP , goodwill impairment reviews are also conducted when an indicator of impairment exists, in addition to an annual
impairment review as required by SFAS 142. The potential impairment is identified by comparing the carrying value of each reporting unit with its fair
value. Where the carrying value including any separately identifiable intangible assets is greater than the fair value, an impairment loss is calculated
based on the excess of the carrying value of goodwill over the implied fair value of goodwill. Where reporting units identified under US GAAP differ
from the CGUs identified under IFRS, a reconciling item may arise.
The group’s reporting units are based on its geographical region and product groups. Goodwill is allocated to these reporting units based on the
location and product base of acquisitions and disposals at the date of the transaction.
Joint-ventures and associates
The main adjustments that would have been necessary to reconcile the joint-ventures and associates not domiciled within the United States to US
GAAP would have been in respect of deferred tax, pensions and goodwill. The group has not included a reconciling item for these adjustments, as
the effect on net income is not material.
Impairment of long-lived assets to be held and used
Under IFRS, property, plant and equipment and intangible assets subject to amortisation are assessed for impairment on an annual basis. Where an
indicator suggests that there is potential for impairment, a review is completed comparing the recoverable amount with the carrying value of the
asset. The recoverable amount is either the value in use based on the expected future cash flows discounted to present value, or the asset’s fair
value less costs to sell. Where the carrying value exceeds the recoverable amount, the asset is impaired to the recoverable value. If in the
subsequent period, the indicator which caused the impairment no longer exists and the recoverable amount has improved, the impairment loss
should be reversed. 
Under US GAAP , such assets are assessed for impairment using a three-step approach. Where an indicator suggests there is potential for
impairment, the group determines whether the sum of the estimated undiscounted cash flows attributable to the long-lived assets in question is less
than their carrying amount. It is only if the sum of the undiscounted cash flows is less than the carrying value of the asset that an impairment should
be recognised. The impairment loss is calculated based on the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds its fair value. When an
impairment is recorded against the cost of the asset, it may not be reversed.
Variable Interest Entities (VIEs)
FIN 46 Revised (FIN 46R) requires the primary beneficiary of variable interests in entities for which control is achieved through means other than
through voting rights to consolidate the VIE. On adoption of FIN 46(R), the group identified a variable interest entity in which Hanson is the primary
beneficiary. This entity is Piedras y Arenas Baja, S de R L de CV (“Piedras”), a 51% joint-venture which previously has been equity accounted for
under US GAAP and was consolidated from January 1, 2004. Piedras is an aggregates producer located in Mexico which in 2005 had turnover of
£11.9m (2004: £9.9m; 2003, £8.0m) and a pre-tax loss of £0.5m (2004: £1.1m; 2003 £1.4m). In addition it had net assets at December 31,
2005 of £3.5m (2004: £3.5m; 2003, £4.9m). Approximately 80% of the annual turnover of Piedras is to the group. There is no recourse to the
general credit of the Company for creditors (or beneficial interest holders) of the consolidated VIE.
Capitalisation of interest costs
Under IFRS, the capitalisation of interest costs is optional. It is the group’s policy under IFRS not to capitalise interest costs. Under US GAAP ,
interest costs associated with the construction of major assets over a period of time, such as facilities for use by the company, are capitalised as part
of the cost of the tangible fixed asset where the impact of the interest cost is material to the financial statements. The interest cost capitalised
represents an allocation of the interest cost incurred during the period required to complete construction of the asset. In 2005, interest costs of
£119.0m have been incurred. Of that amount £2.2m has been capitalised during the period as part of property, plant and equipment under US GAAP .
Inventory valuation
Under IFRS, valuing inventory on a last-in-first-out (LIFO) basis is not permitted. However, under US GAAP , where the inventory is valued on a LIFO
basis for tax purposes in the local state, the same methodology must be used for accounting purposes. Notes to the accounts

Derivative instruments and hedging activities
The group enters into derivative instruments to limit its exposure to interest rate, foreign exchange and commodity price risks.
Until December 31, 2004, certain derivative instruments were not required to be recognised on the balance sheet at fair value. On January 1, 2005,
the group adopted IAS 32 and 39 under IFRS on a prospective basis, requiring designation of hedging instruments and recognition of all derivative
instruments at fair value on the balance sheet. The group’s hedging policy remains unchanged but the instruments are accounted for as described in
the Accounting policies on page 75. 
Under US GAAP , derivative instruments, whether designated as a hedge or not, are required to be recognised on the balance sheet at fair value.
From January 1, 2005, the group has applied hedge accounting for the purposes of SFAS 133 “Accounting for derivative instruments and hedging
activities” where the requirements of SFAS 133 are met. Prior to that date, hedge accounting was not applied for the purposes of US GAAP and
therefore, in 2004, the reconciliation to net income in that period fully reflects the changes in fair value of the derivatives, other than hedges of net
investment. Hedges of net investment and the treatment of realised and unrealised gains and losses are the same under US GAAP as under IFRS,
being taken to equity.
Transition adjustment
In addition, under US GAAP , transition adjustments were required to include the fair value of derivatives on the balance sheet on the adoption of
SFAS 133 at January 1, 2001. For those derivatives considered to be fair value hedges, the January 1, 2001 opening fair value of £17 .1m was
shown as current assets and liabilities – derivatives and as an adjustment to debt. The adjustment to debt is being subsequently amortised through
the income statement over the residual life of the debt. For those derivatives considered to be cash flow hedges, the January 1, 2001 opening value
of £0.5m was shown as current assets and liabilities – derivatives, and as an adjustment to other comprehensive income. The amounts in other
comprehensive income are recognised in the income statement as the related cash flows are realised. 
Pensions
Under both IFRS and US GAAP , the pension cost or credit is determined by reference to the pension liability and the market value of the underlying
plan assets, after adjustment to reflect any previously unrecognised pension obligations or assets. 
For certain pension plans the accumulated benefit obligation at December 31, 2005 exceeded the fair value of related plan assets. Where a pension
plan has an unfunded accumulated benefit obligation, US GAAP requires such amount to be recognised as a liability in the balance sheet. The
adjustment resulting from the recognition of any such minimum liability, including the elimination of amounts previously recognised as a prepaid benefit
cost, is reported as an intangible asset to the extent of unrecognised prior service cost with the remaining amount reported in comprehensive income.
Under US GAAP , surpluses or deficits, which may result where the actual performance of the scheme differs from previous actuarial assumptions,
are dealt with on an aggregate basis. The group applies the 10% corridor test at the beginning of the year, to determine whether amortisation of the
gain or loss is necessary. Where the gain or loss exceeds 10% of the greater of the projected benefit obligations or the market related value of the
scheme’s assets, this is amortised over the active participants’ average remaining service periods. Under IFRS, the group has opted not to apply the
corridor approach and this, therefore, represents a difference in accounting methodology between IFRS and US GAAP . 
The group also provides post-retirement healthcare and life insurance benefits, mainly in the USA, under plans to certain groups of its retired and
active employees. 
Accounting for stock-based compensation
Under IFRS, the group applies the fair value method of accounting for its stock-based compensation plans. For accounting purposes under 
US GAAP , the group applies an intrinsic value method under APB 25 “Accounting for stock issued to employees” as permitted by SFAS 123
“Accounting for stock based compensation” . As permitted under the transition rules for IFRS, the group has applied the accounting methodology 
to awards granted after November 7 , 2002.
In line with the requirements of SFAS 123 and as amended by SFAS 148 “Accounting for stock-based compensation – transaction and disclosure”,
the group provides pro forma disclosure of the impact of applying these standards which are based on a fair value method. For awards granted prior
to 2005, the group has used a Black Scholes model to calculate the fair value of awards. For awards granted since January 1, 2005, the group has
changed its method used to estimate the fair value of certain awards. The Long T erm Incentive Plan (L TIP) and Share Option Plan (SOP) are valued
using a Monte Carlo simulation model for the portion of awards dependent on market conditions and a binomial model for the portion of awards
dependent on non-market conditions. Sharesave awards continue to be valued using a Black Scholes model.
The changes in method used to estimate the fair value were made in order to be consistent with the estimates used for fair values determined under
IFRS. These changes did not have a material impact on the group’s proforma net income or related per share amounts. 
i) Plans excluding performance criteria – Sharesave Scheme
Under IFRS, sharesave schemes are valued at their fair value on the date of grant and are expensed over the vesting period. Under US GAAP , the
20% discount offered to the group’s UK employees on an Inland Revenue approved sharesave scheme should be expensed over the vesting
period, representing the intrinsic value of the award.
ii) Plans including performance criteria – Long T erm Incentive Plan (L TIP) and Share Option Plan (SOP)
The group also operates two schemes which incorporate performance criteria, the SOP and the L TIP . Under IFRS, the fair value of the award is
recognised over the performance period, based on a reasonable expectation of the extent to which the performance criteria will be met.
Adjustments to the expense are made as the number of awards expected to vest reduces as a result of employees leaving the scheme. Under US
GAAP , the plans are treated as variable compensatory plans and the expense is based on the intrinsic value, remeasured at each balance sheet date
and spread over the performance period.
Provisions
Under IFRS, provisions are discounted to reflect the time-value of money based on the estimated timing of cash flows. US GAAP applies a stricter
definition, permitting discounting only where the timing of cash flows are fixed or reliably determinable. IFRS requires a current market discount rate
to be applied to provisions, whereas in the instances that discounting is permitted US GAAP requires the current rate to be used for new
decommissioning provisions, or changes in estimates for existing obligations, without amendment in subsequent periods.
Accounting for restructuring costs
Under IFRS, restructuring costs are recognised where implementation of a formal plan has begun and communicated with those affected. Costs of
leased property, plant and equipment, which will no longer provide economic benefit, are provided for as part of the restructuring plan. Under US
GAAP , termination benefits are recognised where a detailed formal plan has been communicated to employees. Where employees are required to
continue working until they are terminated to be eligible for the termination benefit and that period exceeds the minimum retention period, the cost is
recognised ratably over the retention period. Costs of property, plant and equipment that will continue to be incurred under a leasing contract
without economic benefit are recognised once the assets cease to be used. 
Non-monetary transactions
Under IFRS, exchanges of assets in return for an equity interest in a joint-venture entity are transferred at the fair value of assets surrendered. The fair
value of the equity interest received is measured by its fair value, which is equivalent to the fair value of the assets given up adjusted by the amount of
cash transferred. In this instance a proportion of the gain or loss on the transaction is recognised in the equity shareholders’ income statement. Notes to the accounts continued

33 US accounting information continued
Under US GAAP , from January 2005, the group has adopted SFAS 153 “Exchanges of non-monetary assets” , part of the current FASB and IASB’s 
convergence project. The issuance of this standard removes future differences as it is to be applied on a prospective basis. However, there are a
number of residual differences on acquisitions prior to this date. Previously, APB Opinion No. 29 “Accounting for non-monetary transactions”
provided an exemption to its general principles of measuring such transactions at fair value where the exchange related to similar productive assets.
SFAS 153 has removed this exemption for transactions taking place after January 2005.
Foreign exchange gains and losses on disposals of businesses
Prior to the transition date, under IFRS, cumulative foreign exchange gains and losses relating to disposals were adjusted within reserves. Since
January 1, 2004, cumulative gains and losses are included in determining the profit or loss on disposal of the business. At that date, the group opted
to set the cumulative translation reserve to nil. Under US GAAP , such gains and losses are also included in determining the profit or loss on disposal
but they are tracked from the date of acquisition of the entity. 
Deferred tax
Under both IFRS and US GAAP , deferred taxation liabilities are provided on differences between the book and tax bases of assets and liabilities
except in certain limited circumstances. However, under IFRS, tax written down value may be taken into account for certain assets’ tax base where
as US GAAP requires use of such assets’ tax base for disposal. Under IFRS, deferred tax assets are recognised for future deductions and
utilisations of tax carry forwards to the extent that it is more likely than not that suitable taxable profit is expected to be available. Under US GAAP ,
deferred tax assets are recognised at their full amounts and reduced by a valuation allowance to the extent it is more likely than not that suitable
taxable profits will not be available. Differences in deferred taxation may occur as a result of accounting adjustments between IFRS and US GAAP .
Discontinued operations
Discontinued operations are those clearly distinguishable operations and activities which either ceased or left the group in the accounting period or soon
thereafter, including assets held for sale, where it is probable that the sale will complete within one year. Prior to January1, 2004, under IFRS, assets held
for sale were not treated as discontinued operations. IFRS includes equity instruments as part of discontinued operations whereas US GAAP
specifically excludes equity instruments from scope.
Acquisition accounting
US GAAP requires that a deferred tax asset or liability be raised to reflect the difference between the tax basis of assets acquired and liabilities
assumed, and their fair values at the time of acquisition. The same is true under IFRS. However, where there are differences between the fair values
of these assets and liabilities under IFRS and US GAAP , there will be a resulting difference in the deferred tax calculated. The recognition of
deferred tax assets or liabilities affects the amount of goodwill recognised on acquisition. IFRS requires that contingent consideration is included
within the cost of the consideration at the date of acquisition where it is probable that the resolution of the contingency will result in the transfer of
economic benefit and that the amount can be measured reliably. US GAAP , however, only permits recognition of such consideration once the
contingency is resolved and the amount to be paid is determinable. Under IFRS, when shares are issued as consideration for an acquisition, the 
fair value of that consideration is based upon the share price at the date the acquisition is unconditional. Under US GAAP , the acquisition price is
based upon the share price over a reasonable period of time before and after the date that the acquisitions are agreed to and announced. Where an
acquisition results in negative goodwill, IFRS requires that the excess amount is immediately written off in the Income statement. US GAAP requires
the excess to initially be proportionally allocated to the fair values assigned to non-current assets. 
Asset recognition
Under IFRS, contingent assets become recognisable in accordance with the criteria set out in IAS 37 “Provisions, contingent liabilities and contingent
assets” . Where such an asset is recognised under IFRS, it is discounted to its present value based on the timing of expected cash flows. Although
broadly similar, there are certain circumstances under US GAAP where a contingent asset can only be recognised if additional criteria are met.
New US accounting standards and pronouncements not yet adopted
In December 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued FASB Statement No. 123 (Revised 2004), “Share-Based Payment”
(SFAS 123(R)), which is a revision of SFAS 123 “Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation” (SFAS 123). SFAS 123(R) supersedes APB
Opinion No. 25 “Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees” (APB 25) which is the group’s current accounting policy under US GAAP . It also
amends FASB Statement No. 95 “Statement of Cash Flows” . The approach in SFAS 123(R) is similar to the approach described in SFAS 123.
However, SFAS 123(R) requires all share-based payments to employees, including grants of share options, to be recognised in the income
statement based on their fair values. The pro forma disclosure option under SFAS 123 will no longer be allowed. 
The group expects to adopt the requirements of SFAS 123(R) as its accounting policy for the financial year ended December 2006. SFAS 123(R)
permits adoption of the requirements using one of two methods: a “modified prospective” method where the requirements are applied to all share-
based payments granted after the effective date of the statement; or a “modified retrospective” method which allows entities to restate prior periods
based on the amounts previously recognised under SFAS 123 for the purposes of pro forma disclosures. Hanson plans to adopt SFAS 123(R)
using the modified prospective method. This requires the group to not restate prior periods but to provide the pro forma disclosures previously
required under SFAS 123. 
As permitted by SFAS 123, the group currently accounts for share-based payments to employees using APB 25’s intrinsic value method rather than the
fair value method under SFAS 123(R). Accordingly, the adoption of SFAS 123(R)’s fair value method will impact the group’s results of operations. The
impact of adoption of SFAS 123(R) cannot be predicted at this time because it will depend on levels of share-based payments granted in the future.
However, had the group adopted SFAS 123(R) in prior periods, the impact of the standard would have approximated the impact of SFAS 123 as
described in the disclosure of proforma net income and earnings per share in Note 33(l). SFAS 123(R) also requires the benefits of tax deductions in
excess of recognised compensation cost to be reported as a financing cash flow rather than as an operating cash flow as it is reported currently. This
requirement will reduce net operating cash flows and increase net financing cash flows in periods after adoption. While the company cannot estimate
what those amounts will be in the future, the amount of operating cash flows recognised in prior periods for such excess tax deductions were £0.7m,
£1.1m and £0.7m in 2005, 2004 and 2003 respectively.
In May 2005, the FASB issued Statement No. 154 “Accounting Changes and Error Corrections” (SFAS 154) which converges the methodology of
accounting for changes in accounting policy and prior period errors with that of IAS 8 “Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and
Errors” (IAS 8), requiring retrospective adoption of new accounting policies to aid comparison between all periods presented in the financial
statements. The group intends to adopt this statement for US GAAP reporting purposes in the financial year ended December 2006.
In March 2005, the FASB ratified Emerging Issues T ask Force Issue 04-06, “Accounting for Stripping Costs in the Mining Industry” (“EITF 04-06”).
EITF 04-06 clarifies that post-production stripping costs, which represent costs of removing overburden and waste materials to access mineral
deposits, should be considered costs of the extracted minerals under a full absorption costing system and recorded as a component of inventory to
be recognised in costs of sales in the same period as the revenue from the sale of inventory. EITF 04-06 is effective January 1, 2006 and any capitalised
post-production stripping costs will be recognised as an adjustment to retaining earnings at that date. The group expects the impact on its financial
conditions or results of operations to be immaterial. Notes to the accounts

Under US GAAP , cash and cash equivalents for cash flow purposes include short-term liquid resources but not overdrafts. Under IFRS, overdrafts 
are included within the definition of cash equivalents. Under US GAAP , capitalised interest is treated as part of the cost of the asset to which it 
relates and thus included as part of investing cash flows; under IFRS all interest is treated as operating activities.

being £32.6m (2004: £108.0m). The valuation allowance is in respect of unrecognised tax losses of £250.0m (2004: £360.0m).
The group has reserves for taxes that may become payable in future periods as a result of tax audits. It is the group’s policy to establish reserves 
for taxes that may become payable in future years as a result of an examination by tax authorities. The tax reserves are analysed at each balance
sheet date and adjustments are made as events occur to warrant adjustment to the reserves. At any given time, the group is undergoing tax audits 
in several tax jurisdictions and covering multiple years. The accrual for these reserves at December 31, 2005 was £103.0m (£108.5m).
The decrease is due to revisions to the best reasonable estimate of the tax exposure, cash paid on certain audits and settlements of certain audits.
The group has not provided deferred tax liabilities related to differences of its foreign subsidiaries and joint ventures under Accounting Principles
Board Opinion (APB) 23, “Accounting for Income T axes – Special Areas” as it is the group’s policy to permanently reinvest such earnings.
Quantifying the amount of undistributed earnings and deferred tax liabilities is not practical.
“FASB Staff Position No 109-2” Accounting and Disclosure Guidance for the Foreign Earnings Repatriation Provision within the American Jobs
Creation Act of 2004” , provides guidance under FASB Statement No. 109, “Accounting for Income T axes, ” with respect to recording any potential
impact of the repatriation provisions of the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004. Hanson has determined that the benefits are immaterial to the
financial statements at December 31, 2005.

On December 8, 2003, the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernisation Act (the “Act”) was signed into law. The Act introduces 
a prescription drug benefit under Medicare as well as a federal subsidy to sponsors of retiree health care benefit plans. As of December 31, 2003,
the Company gave consideration of the Act’s changes to its other post-employment medical benefits by reducing the accumulated benefit
obligation by approximately £12.4m for that portion of the benefit pertaining solely to prescription drugs. This amount was reflected in the “Actuarial
(gains) and losses” of the rollforward of the accumulated benefit obligation for 2003. The Company has recorded no benefit for this change in its net
periodic benefit cost for 2003, but recorded income of approximately £0.9m and £2.0m in 2005 and 2004, respectively as a result of decreased
service and interest costs and by amortising the unrecognised gain over the expected service lives of the active participants.
Assumed health care trend rates have a significant effect on the amounts reported for the post-retirement medical benefit plans. A one-percentage 
point change in assumed health care cost trend rates would have the following effects on active and non-active liabilities as at December 31, 2005:
1-percentage 1-percentage
point increase point decrease
£m £m
Effect on total of service and interest cost components 0.4 (0.3)
Effect on post-retirement medical benefit obligation 5.4 (5.0)
The US plans’ assets are primarily included in the Hanson Building Materials America Inc. Pension Trust (“Trust”), which invests in listed stocks and
bonds. At December 31, 2003, December 31, 2004 and at December 31, 2005 the Trust had no investment in Hanson ordinary shares.
Within the UK, the fund assets are dealt with by several directly invested funds for the periods ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003 where
funds did not invest in the shares of the Company.

8.1 372.2
In 2005, previously recognised impairment charges against property, plant and equipment in North America of £19.6m have been reversed. The
reversal of such impairments is not permitted under US GAAP . In addition, an impairment of goodwill of £17 .6m has been recognised under IFRS.
Under US GAAP , £15.5m of this impairment has been recognised previously and therefore the IFRS impairment has been reversed.
Of the amounts charged as impairments in 2004 under IFRS, £nil had been charged in prior years as amortisation under US GAAP or previously
impaired under IFRS, and is therefore shown as a reduction in the difference between the charge under IFRS and US GAAP . The operating
impairment charge of £29.3m in 2004 under IFRS relates to various operations within North America, the UK and Asia Pacific, where it has been
necessary to make an impairment provision for the difference in these operations’ carrying values compared with the higher of their value in use or
net realisable value. 
In 2004, an impairment charge of £320.8m was recognised under US GAAP in relation to Hanson Aggregates UK goodwill following the annual
SFAS 142 impairment review. This related in part to goodwill which was written off to reserves under IFRS prior to 1998 and also reflected the
current assessment of implied goodwill following the recent strategic review of this business. In addition, £2.7m of goodwill was written off under
US GAAP in relation to Asia Pacific’s Singapore operations.
j) Additional information required by US GAAP in respect of accounting for intangible assets subject to amortisation
Other intangible assets subject to amortisation primarily consisting of purchase options, order backlogs and non-compete agreements capitalised 
since 2003, that have a cost of £35.0m (£12.9m) and an accumulated amortisation charge of £5.5m (£3.4m). The estimated aggregate amortisation
expense for each of the next five years is £2.4m, £2.3m, £2.2m, £1.9m and £1.8m. Notes to the accounts continued

Hanson has various share option and sharesave schemes. A description of the plans is included in note 5. In addition, certain employees have
participated in the Hanson Inland Revenue Approved Share Option Scheme, under which they were granted ordinary shares by purchase. The fair 
value of options granted during the years ended: 2005, 2004 and 2003 are as follows:

In 2004 and 2003, the group applied historical volatility as its basis to estimate expected volatility for the proforma disclosure required by SFAS
123. In light of guidance provided by IFRS and in conjunction with external advisors, the group has re-evaluated its process for estimating volatility in
2005 resulting in volatility assumptions which are more reflective of market conditions. This process has been applied prospectively for SFAS 123
reporting purposes in 2005. The changes did not have a material impact on the group’s proforma net income or related per share amounts.
The weighted average fair value of share options and long-term incentive plans granted in 2005 were estimated using a Monte Carlo pricing model
where the award includes market-based performance criteria and a binomial pricing model where the award includes non-market-based
performance criteria. The assumptions used were as follows: dividend yield 4.3%, expected volatility 24.9% for Long T erm Incentive Plans and
30.7% for the share option plan and expected life of three years for the Long T erm Incentive Plan and 6.5 years for the Share Option Plan and a risk
free interest rate 4.8% for the Share Option Plan. 
The weighted average fair value of sharesave schemes granted in 2005 were estimated using a Black Scholes pricing model using the following
assumptions: dividend yield 4.3%, expected volatility 26.7% and expected life of 5.4 years.
The weighted average fair value of options granted in 2004 and 2003 were estimated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model with the
following assumptions: dividend yield 4.3% (4.0%, nil) expected volatility of 28.1% (29.2%, nil) risk free interest rate of 4.9% (5.0%, nil) and
expected life of 4.2 years (4.2 years, nil) for the sharesave schemes and 6.5 years (2.5 years, nil) for the share option plans. 33 US accounting information continued

Ordinary shareholders who wish to have future dividends paid direct into their bank or building society account should contact Lloyds TSB Registrars
at the address shown on the inside back cover. Payment to banks outside the UK is available to private shareholders subject to a small charge.
Dividend policy
The Board remains committed to a progressive dividend policy, although this will be subject to maintaining a reasonable level of dividend cover over
the medium-term. The increase of 10.0% in the dividend for 2002, of 10.1% for 2003, of 7 .1% for 2004, followed by an increase of 10.2% for 2005
reflects the introduction of a more progressive approach to dividend payments. Future dividends will be dependent upon Hanson’s earnings,
financial condition and other factors.
Dividend reinvestment programme
There is a dividend reinvestment programme (“DRIP”) for registered holders of Hanson ADSs who reside in the USA or Canada. This programme
provides holders with a convenient and economical method (lower brokerage commissions) of investing cash dividends and optional cash deposits 
in additional ADSs at the market price, by having their purchases combined with those of other participants. For more information or a copy of the
Hanson DRIP booklet call Citibank Shareholder Services on (877) 248 4237 or write to Citibank at the address shown on the inside back cover.
Major shareholders
To its knowledge, Hanson is not owned or controlled directly or indirectly by any government or by any other corporation. As of February 21, 2006,
Hanson has been notified of the following persons who, directly or indirectly, are interested in 3% or more of the issued share capital. The voting 
rights of the major shareholders listed below are the same as for the other holders of ordinary shares or ADSs. 
Number of % of issued share
Name ordinary shares million capital at date of notification
Vanguard Windsor Funds – Vanguard Windsor II Fund 39.1 5.3
Legal & General Investment Management 36.9 5.0
Standard Life Group 22.4 3.0
Prudential plc 21.9 3.0
Barclays Bank plc 21.9 3.0

Other than as identified above and interests held as bare nominee, Hanson has not been notified of any other interests in 5% or more of the ordinary 
shares (including ADSs) in the three years prior to the date of the Annual Report and Form 20-F .
As at February 21, 2006 15.5m ADSs were held of record in the USA. The 77 .7m ordinary shares (10.8% of the issued share capital, excluding shares
held in treasury) representing those ADSs were registered in the name of National City Nominees Limited.
As of February 21, 2006, approximately 0.3m ordinary shares were held of record in the USA by approximately 260 record holders. Hanson believes
that as of February 21, 2006, approximately 3.83% of its outstanding ordinary shares were also beneficially owned by US holders. Since certain of
these securities are held by brokers or other nominees, the number of holders of record in the USA may not be representative of the number of
beneficial owners or of where the beneficial owners are resident. 
Ordinary shareholders
As at February 21, 2006 there were 736,968,849 ordinary shares in issue, of which 18,250,000 were held in treasury. There were 48,168 
registered holders.  Investor information

E-communication
Hanson encourages shareholders to elect to receive shareholder documents such as Annual and Interim Reports and shareholder circulars
electronically, by downloading from the Company’s website, rather than by post. There are clear advantages to doing so – it means less cost for 
the Company, less paperwork for shareholders to deal with, speedier delivery of documents and it is environmentally friendly. All future shareholder
mailings will allow for electronic distribution for those electing this option.
Shareholders choosing to take advantage of this option, which is free to shareholders, will receive an e-mail notification each time a shareholder
publication is placed on the Company’s website. Please note that those so electing will be able to change their mind about receiving documents 
by electronic notification at any time and that it will be the responsibility of the shareholder to notify any change of e-mail address.
Ordinary shareholders who wish to register to receive future shareholder documents electronically should access the Shareview facility provided 
by Lloyds TSB Registrars at www.shareview.co.uk. T o register, shareholders will need their shareholder reference number (which can be found 
on the share certificate or dividend voucher). Agreement to the terms and conditions applying will be sought at the end of the registration process.

Description of business 
General development of business
Hanson became a business focused purely on building materials in
1997 following the demerger of the old Hanson conglomerate. The
major building materials companies remaining within Hanson at the time
were ARC, Hanson Brick and Cornerstone.
Hanson management transformed the business into a world leading
building materials company through a series of disposals and
acquisitions, the largest of which was the acquisition of the Australian
construction materials business, Pioneer International, in May 2000.
Following a series of restructurings, Hanson now operates as four
identifiable trading regions: Hanson North America (46.7% of 2005
continuing turnover), Hanson UK (31.7% of 2005 continuing turnover),
Hanson Australia & Asia Pacific (15.4% of 2005 continuing turnover),
and Hanson Continental Europe (6.2% of 2005 continuing turnover). 
This structure reinforces a continued focus on our core values of cost 
and margin control, together with disciplined and proactive growth via
capital expenditure and bolt-on acquisitions.
North America
Hanson’s North American operations are organised into two operating
groups, Hanson Aggregates North America and Hanson Building
Products North America, with a corporate office in Neptune, New Jersey.
(a) Hanson Aggregates North America
Hanson Aggregates North America, headquartered in Dallas, T exas
produces aggregates, ready-mixed concrete, asphalt and cement has
over 350 operating locations throughout the USA.
(b) Hanson Building Products North America
Hanson Building Products North America, headquartered in Dallas,
Texas, is divided into two sub-groups, Pipe & Precast and Brick & Tile.
Pipe & Precast, also headquartered in Dallas, produces concrete pipes,
and products and precast concrete for the US and Canadian markets.
Brick & Tile, with its headquarters in Charlotte, North Carolina, produces
bricks for the US and Canadian markets from its principal manufacturing
factories in Canada, T exas, and the Carolinas, and roof tiles from its
plants in Florida, California, T exas and Arizona.
UK
Hanson reports as two groups in the UK, Hanson Aggregates UK and
Hanson Buildings Products UK. 
(a) Hanson Aggregates UK
Hanson Aggregates UK produces aggregates, ready-mixed concrete
and asphalt in the UK through its own operations and is a partner in a
number of joint-venture companies, the most significant of which is
Midland Quarry Products Limited, owned jointly with a member of the
T armac group of companies. 
Included within Hanson Aggregates UK are Hanson’s marine dredging
operations which, through a wholly owned subsidiary and United Marine
Holdings Limited, a joint-venture with a member of the T armac group of
companies, supply sea-dredged aggregates to the UK, Belgium,
Holland and France.
(b) Hanson Building Products UK
Hanson Building Products UK supplies bricks and concrete products,
concrete flooring, precast concrete and packed aggregates products
throughout the UK.
Australia & Asia Pacific
Hanson Australia is a major supplier of construction materials to the
Australian market. Its operations are divided into two operating groups:
Hanson Construction Materials, which produces ready-mixed concrete
and aggregates; and Hanson Building Products, which produces
blocks, pavers and retaining walls. Its other major interests include (i) its
25% share in Cement Australia Holdings Pty Ltd, jointly owned with
Rinker Group Ltd and Holcim Ltd, which operates cement plants in New
South Wales, T asmania and Queensland, and (ii) Pioneer Road Services

Business overview
Seasonality
Seasonality is a significant factor affecting all of our operations. In our
major markets in the USA, the UK and northern Continental Europe,
activity is very much concentrated during the period between March and
November, while the winter in Australia and the rainy season and
Chinese New Y ear in Asia Pacific cause a material slow-down in
operations during these periods. Unusual weather patterns, in particular
heavy and sustained rainfall during peak construction periods, can
cause significant delays and have an adverse impact on our businesses.
Sources and availability of raw materials
We generally own or lease the real estate on which the raw materials,
namely aggregates and clay resources/reserves, essential to our main
businesses are found, although in the case of the marine businesses of
Hanson Aggregates UK and Hanson Aggregates North America, we
operate under licences from the relevant national and local authorities.
We are also a significant purchaser of certain important materials such
as cement, bitumen, steel, gas, fuel and other energy supplies, the cost
of which can fluctuate by material amounts and consequently have an
adverse impact on our businesses. We are not generally dependent on
any one source for the supply of these products, other than in certain
jurisdictions with regard to the supply of gas and electricity. Competitive
markets generally exist in the jurisdictions in which we operate for the
supply of cement, bitumen, steel and fuel. In 2005, percentage price
changes in the cement market ranged from a 2%-20% increase.
Bitumen prices are affected by general oil price changes. In 2005,
percentage price changes in the bitumen market ranged from a
decrease of 11% to an increase of 46%.
Sales and marketing
Although sales and marketing activities are more important in
connection with our brick business in both the USA and the UK, where
branding of the product is a factor, in general the nature of the majority
products, ie rock, sand, gravel, ready-mixed concrete and concrete
products, and the cost of transportation means that marketing and
selling is conducted on a more localised basis, with an emphasis on
service and delivery. Sales and marketing costs tend to be relatively low
in relation to the overall delivered price of our products.
Competitive position
Statements relating to Hanson’s position as one of the leading heavy
building materials companies, one of the largest producers of
aggregates and one of the largest producers of heavy building products
are based on management estimates.
Governmental regulation (including environmental)
Many products produced by our operating units are subject to
government regulation in various jurisdictions regarding production and
sale. We believe that our operating units have taken, and continue to
take, measures to comply with applicable laws and government
regulations in the jurisdictions in which we operate so that the risk of
sanctions does not represent a material threat to any of the operating
units individually or to Hanson as a whole. We also believe that
compliance with these regulations does not substantially affect the
ability of our subsidiaries to compete with similarly situated companies. Ancillary information continued
Ancillary information
134
In addition to the regulatory framework described above, our operating
units are subject to extensive regulation by national, state and local
agencies concerning such matters as planning, environmental and
health and safety compliance. In addition, numerous governmental
permits and approvals are required for our operations. We believe that
our operating units are currently operating in substantial compliance
with, or under approved variances from, various national, state and local
regulations. We do not believe that such compliance will materially
adversely affect our business or results of operations. In the past, our
subsidiaries have made significant capital and maintenance
expenditures to comply with planning, water, air and solid and hazardous
waste regulations and these subsidiaries may be required to do so in the
future. From time to time, various agencies may serve cease and desist
orders or notices of violation on an operating unit or deny its applications
for certain licences or permits, in each case alleging that the practices of
the operating unit are not consistent with the regulations or ordinances.
In some cases, the relevant operating unit may seek to meet with the
agency to determine mutually acceptable methods of modifying or
eliminating the practice in question. We believe that our operating units
should be able to achieve compliance with the applicable regulations
and ordinances in a manner which should not have a material adverse
effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.
Approximately, 100 present and former US operating sites, or portions
thereof, currently or previously owned and/or leased by current or former
companies acquired by Hanson (responsibility for which remains with a
member of the Hanson group) are the subject of claims, investigations,
monitoring or remediation under the US federal Comprehensive
Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (“CERCLA”),
the US federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act or comparable
US state statutes or agreements with third parties. These proceedings
are in various stages ranging from initial enquiries to active settlement
negotiations to implementation of response actions. In addition, a
number of present and former Hanson operating units (responsibility for
which remains with a member of the Hanson group) have been named
as Potentially Responsible Parties (“PRPs”) at approximately 40 off-site
landfills under CERCLA or comparable state statutes. In each of these
matters the Hanson operating unit is working with the governmental
agencies involved and other PRPs to address environmental claims 
in a responsible and appropriate manner. A substantial majority of 
these operating and landfill sites are covered by the environmental
insurance policy referred to under the heading “Material Contracts”
referred to below.
We do not believe that any of the above proceedings relating to
operating sites and off-site landfills not covered by the environmental
insurance policy should materially adversely affect our business,
financial condition or results of operations. At December 31, 2005, we
had accrued £179.3m for environmental obligations, including legal and
other costs, at such sites as are not covered by the above-mentioned
environmental insurance policy. Costs associated with environmental
assessments and remediation efforts are accrued when determined 
to represent a probable loss and to be capable of being reasonably
estimated. There can be no assurance that the ultimate resolution 
of these matters will not differ materially from our estimates.
We cannot predict whether future developments in laws and regulations
concerning environmental and health and safety protection will affect
our earnings or cash flow in a materially adverse manner or whether our
operating units will be successful in meeting future demands of
regulatory agencies in a manner which will not materially adversely affect
our business, financial condition or results of operations.
For other legal proceedings against Hanson, see note 26 of the Notes to
the accounts.
Patents and trademarks
Our operating units have various patents, registered trademarks, trade
names and trade secrets and applications for, or licences in respect of,
the same that relate to various businesses. We believe that certain of
these intellectual property rights are of material importance to the
businesses to which they relate. We believe that the material patents,
trademarks, trade names and trade secrets of our operating subsidiaries
and divisions are adequately protected and that the expiration of patents
and patent licences should not have a material adverse effect upon our
business, financial condition or results of operations.
Employees
As at December 31, 2005, the group employed 24,300 employees. 
An analysis of employee numbers by business and geographical area is
found in note 4 of the Notes to the accounts. We believe that in general
our relationship with our employees and trade unions or other bodies
representing our employees is good.
Property, plants and equipment
As of December 31, 2005, our operating units owned 1,121 plants 
and other freehold properties, of which 486 were located in North
America, 297 were located in the UK, 295 were located in Australia 
and Asia and 43 were located in Continental Europe. The remaining
properties of our operating units throughout the world, including other
manufacturing facilities, warehouses, stores and offices, were leased.
None of the individual properties is considered to have a value that is 
of major significance in relation to our assets as a whole. For a
description of certain environmental issues that may affect our utilisation
of our assets, see under the heading “Governmental regulation
(including environmental)” referred to above.
Material contracts
For details relating to the Deposit Agreement under which the Hanson
ADSs were issued, the indentures under which the group’s public
bonds were issued and various agreements and indemnities relating to
the demergers, see under the heading “Exhibits” included in Hanson
PLC’s 2005 Annual Report and Form 20-F filed with the Securities and
Exchange Commission.
In August 1998, an agreement was reached under which, for a one-off
premium and related transaction costs totalling $275m, insurance cover
of $800m (after payment by the group of the first $100m of remediation
costs arising since January 1, 1998) was available to meet the costs of
remediating the environmental liabilities relating to the former Koppers’
company operations of Beazer plc (“Beazer”) (acquired by Hanson in
1991). The insurance cover is provided by the subsidiaries of two
leading reinsurance companies, Centre Solutions (a member of the
Zurich Group) and Swiss Re. Administration of the environmental
remediation programme will continue to be carried out by Beazer.
In April 2005, we entered into a five year £500m multi-currency
revolving credit facility arranged by Barclays Capital and J.P . Morgan plc
with a syndicate of banks. This replaced our five year £519.2m facility
due to expire in March 2006. The new facility contains a US$947m
swingline advance facility and a sub-limit of up to £300m for Australian
dollar loan note advances. In addition, in July 2004, we entered into a five
year US$475m facility arranged by Banc of America Securities Limited
and Citigroup Global Markets Limited with a syndicate of banks. This
facility is available to be drawn as either cash advances or standby
letters of credit.
Exchange controls
There are no UK restrictions on the import or export of capital including
foreign exchange controls that affect the remittances of dividends or
other payments to non-resident holders of ordinary shares except as
otherwise set forth in “T axation information for US shareholders” below
and except for certain restrictions imposed from time to time by HM
Treasury pursuant to legislation such as The United Nations Act 1946
and the Emergency Laws Act 1964 against the government or residents
of certain countries.
Except for the general limitations contained in the Company’s
Memorandum and Articles of Association and in the Deposit Agreement
governing the Company’s ADSs, and certain restrictions that may be
imposed from time to time by HM Treasury under legislation as
described above, under English law and Hanson’s Memorandum and
Articles of Association, persons who are neither residents nor nationals
of the UK may freely hold, vote and transfer ordinary shares in the same
manner as UK residents or nationals.
Taxation information for US shareholders
The following paragraphs are intended as a general guide only and do
not purport to be a complete technical analysis or listing of all potential
tax effects relevant to the ADSs or the ordinary shares. The statements
of US federal tax laws set forth below are based on provisions of the US
Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, current and proposed US
Treasury regulations promulgated thereunder, and administrative and
judicial decisions, all of which are subject to change, possibly on a
retrospective basis.
This discussion addresses only US shareholders that beneficially own 
and hold ADSs or ordinary shares as capital assets and use the US
dollar as their functional currency, and that are either a citizen or resident
of the USA for US federal income tax purposes, or a corporation, or
other entity treated as a corporation for US federal income tax purposes,
created or organised under the laws of the USA or any political
subdivision thereof, or an estate the income of which is subject to US
federal income taxation regardless of its sources, or a trust, if a court
within the USA is able to exercise primary supervision over the
administration of the trust and one or more US persons have the
authority to control all substantial decisions of the trust (each a “US
shareholder” for the purposes of this discussion). Ancillary information
135
The discussion does not consider the tax treatment of beneficiaries 
of trusts or estates, partnerships or other pass-through entities or 
persons who hold ordinary shares or ADSs through a partnership 
or other pass-through entity.
This discussion does not address all aspects of US federal income
taxation, such as US federal gift or estate tax, nor state or local taxation.
It does not address the tax consequences for financial institutions,
financial services entities, insurance companies, dealers in securities or
foreign currencies, persons subject to the alternative minimum tax,
persons owning directly, indirectly or by attribution 5% or more of the
total combined voting power of the stock of Hanson, persons carrying
on a trade or business in the UK through a permanent establishment,
persons who acquired ordinary shares or ADSs as compensation,
persons who elect mark-to-market accounting, tax-exempt entities or
private foundations, persons that hold the ordinary shares or ADSs as
part of a straddle, hedge, constructive sale or conversion transaction or
other integrated transaction, persons whose functional currency is other
than the US dollar, certain expatriates or former long-term residents of
the USA or holders who elected to apply the provisions of the former
income tax convention between the USA and the UK.
US shareholders and holders of Hanson ADSs should consult their tax
advisors with regard to the application of the US federal income tax laws
to their particular situation, as well as any tax consequences arising
under the laws of any state, local or foreign taxing jurisdiction.
Considerations relevant to the ADSs and ordinary shares 
US shareholders of ADSs are not members of the Company but may
instruct Citibank N.A., the Depositary, as to the exercise of voting rights
pertaining to the number of ordinary shares represented by their ADSs.
However, US shareholders of ADSs are generally treated as the owners
of the underlying ordinary shares for purposes of the US-UK double
taxation conventions relating to income and gains (the “UK-US income
tax treaty”) and to estate and gift taxes (the “Estate and Gift T ax
Convention”), and generally for purposes of the US federal tax laws.
Taxation of dividends
A US shareholder will be required to include in gross income as ordinary
income the amount of any dividend paid on the ordinary shares or ADSs
on the date the dividend is received to the extent the dividend is paid out
of our current or accumulated earnings and profits, as determined for US
federal income tax purposes. Dividends in excess of these earnings and
profits will be applied against, and will reduce, the US shareholder’s
basis in the ADSs or ordinary shares and, to the extent in excess of such
basis, will be treated as gain from the sale or exchange of such ADSs or
ordinary shares. In addition, dividends of current or accumulated
earnings and profits will be foreign source passive income for US foreign
tax credit purposes and will not qualify for the dividends-received
deduction otherwise available to corporations. 
Dividends paid out of current or accumulated earnings in foreign
currency to a US shareholder will be includable in the income of a 
US shareholder in a US dollar amount calculated by reference to the
exchange rate on the date the dividend is received, regardless of
whether the dividend is in fact converted into US dollars on such date. 
A US shareholder that receives a foreign currency dividend and converts
the foreign currency into US dollars subsequent to receipt will have
foreign exchange gain or loss based on any appreciation or depreciation
in the value of the foreign currency against the US dollar, which will
generally be US source ordinary income or loss.
An individual US shareholder’s “qualified dividend income” is subject to
tax at a reduced rate of tax of 15%. For this purpose, qualified dividend
income includes dividends from foreign corporations if (a) the stock of
such corporation with respect to which such dividend is paid is readily
tradable on an established securities market in the USA, including
NASDAQ, or (b) such corporation is eligible for the benefits of a
comprehensive tax treaty with the USA that includes an information
exchange programme and is determined to be satisfactory to the US
Secretary of the Treasury. The US Secretary of the Treasury has
indicated that the UK-US income tax treaty which came into effect on
March 31, 2003 (the “Treaty”) is satisfactory for this purpose. Dividends
will not, however, qualify for the reduced rate if such corporation is
treated for the tax year in which dividends are paid (or in the prior year)
as a “passive foreign investment company” for US federal income tax
purposes. Based on the nature of Hanson’s operations, Hanson does
not believe that it would be treated as a passive foreign investment
company. Accordingly, if Hanson’s beliefs are correct, dividend
distributions with respect to its ordinary shares or ADSs should be
treated as qualified dividend income and subject to the US
shareholder’s satisfaction of the holding period requirements described
below, should be eligible for the reduced 15% US federal income tax
rate. A US shareholder will not be entitled to the reduced rate: (a) if the
US shareholder has not held the ordinary shares or ADSs for at least 61
days of the 121 day period beginning on the date which is 60 days
before the ex-dividend date; or (b) to the extent the US shareholder is
under an obligation to make related payments on substantially similar or
related property. Any days during which a US shareholder has
diminished its risk of loss on the ordinary shares or ADSs are not
counted towards meeting the 61 day holding period required by the
statute. The UK does not currently apply a withholding tax on dividends
under its internal laws. However, if such a withholding tax were
introduced, the UK would be entitled, under the Treaty, in certain
circumstances to impose a withholding tax at a rate of up to 15% on
dividends paid to a US shareholder. Subject to applicable limitations, 
a US shareholder who was subject to any such withholding should be
entitled to claim a deduction for withheld tax or, subject to the holding
period requirements mentioned below, a credit for such withholding tax
against such holder’s US federal income tax liability. The US foreign tax
credit limitation may be reduced to the extent that dividends are eligible
for the reduced rate described above.
Taxation of capital gains
Upon a sale or other disposition of ordinary shares or ADSs, a US
shareholder will recognise gain or loss for US federal income tax
purposes in an amount equal to the difference between the US dollar
value of the amount realised and the US shareholder’s tax basis
(determined in US dollars) in such ordinary shares or ADSs. Generally,
such gain or loss will be capital gain or loss and will be long-term capital
gain or loss if the US shareholder’s holding period for such ordinary
shares or ADSs exceeds one year. Any such gain or loss generally will be
income or loss from sources within the US for foreign tax credit limitation
purposes. Long-term capital gain of a non-corporate US shareholder is
generally subject to a maximum tax rate of 15%. The deductibility of a
capital loss recognised on the sale or exchange of ordinary shares or
ADSs is subject to limitations. 
If the ordinary shares or ADSs are publicly traded, a disposition of such
ordinary shares or ADSs will be considered to occur on the “trade date” ,
regardless of the US shareholder’s method of accounting. A US
shareholder that uses the cash method of accounting calculates the US
dollar value of the proceeds received on the sale as of the date that the
sale settles. However, a US shareholder that uses the accrual method of
accounting is required to calculate the value of the proceeds of the sale
as of the “trade date” and, therefore, may realise foreign currency gain or
loss, unless such US shareholder has elected to use the settlement date
to determine its proceeds of sale for purposes of calculating such
foreign currency gain or loss. In addition, a US shareholder that receives
foreign currency upon the sale or exchange of the ordinary shares or
ADSs and converts the foreign currency into US dollars subsequent to
receipt will have foreign exchange gain or loss based on an appreciation
or depreciation in the value of the foreign currency against the US dollar.
Foreign exchange gain or loss will generally be US source ordinary
income or loss.
A US citizen who is resident (or in certain circumstance has been
resident within the previous five UK years of assessment for tax) 
or ordinarily resident in the UK or a US corporation which is resident 
in the UK by reason of being managed and controlled in the UK or 
a US citizen who, or US corporation which, is trading in the UK through 
a branch or agency and has used, held or acquired ADSs or ordinary
shares for the purposes of such trade, branch or agency, may be 
liable for both UK and US tax on any gain on the disposal of ADSs 
or ordinary shares. Subject to certain limitations, such a person will
generally be entitled to a tax credit against any US federal tax liability for
the amount of any UK tax (namely, capital gains tax in the case 
of an individual and corporation tax on chargeable gains in the case 
of a corporation) which is paid in respect of such gain.
US information reporting and backup withholding 
A US shareholder is generally subject to information reporting
requirements with respect to dividends paid in the USA on ADSs or
ordinary shares. In addition, a US shareholder is subject to backup
withholding (currently at a rate of 28%) on dividends paid in the USA on
ADSs or ordinary shares unless the US shareholder provides an IRS
Form W-9 or otherwise establishes an exemption. A US shareholder is
subject to information reporting and backup withholding (currently at a
rate of 28%) on proceeds paid from a sale, exchange, redemption or
other disposition of ADSs or ordinary shares unless the US shareholder
provides an IRS Form W-9 or otherwise establishes an exemption.
Backup withholding is not an additional tax. The amount of any backup
withholding will be allowed as a credit against a US shareholder’s US
federal income tax liability and may entitle such holder to a refund,
provided that certain information is furnished on a timely basis to the IRS. Ancillary information continued

Inheritance tax
The United Kingdom imposes inheritance tax, broadly, on transfers 
of capital which occur on death and in the preceding seven years. 
HM Revenue & Customs is known to consider that the Estate and Gift
T ax Convention applies to inheritance tax and it is understood that, in
practice, both the HM Revenue & Customs and the US Internal Revenue
Service apply the provisions of the Estate and Gift T ax Convention to
inheritance tax. On this assumption, an ADS or ordinary share held by an
individual who is domiciled in, or a citizen of, the United States and is not
a national of or domiciled in the United Kingdom will not be subject to
UK inheritance tax on the individual’s death or on a transfer of the ADS
or ordinary share during the individual’s lifetime except in the exceptional
case where the ADS or ordinary share is part of the business property of
a UK permanent establishment or an enterprise or pertains to a UK fixed
base of an individual used for the performance of independent personal
services. Special rules apply where an ADS or ordinary share is held in
trust. The Estate and Gift T ax Convention generally provides a credit for
the amount of any tax paid in the United Kingdom against the US federal
tax liability or for tax paid in the USA to be credited against the United
Kingdom liability (according to rules set out in the Convention) in a case
where the ADS or ordinary share is subject both to UK inheritance tax
and to US federal gift or estate tax.
Stamp duty and stamp duty reserve tax
Stamp duty will, subject to certain exceptions, be payable at the rate 
of 1.5%, rounded up to the nearest £5, on any instrument transferring
ordinary shares to the Custodian of the Depositary on the value of such
ordinary shares. In accordance with the terms of the Deposit Agreement,
any tax or duty payable by the Depositary or the Custodian of the
Depositary on future deposits of ordinary shares may be charged 
by the Depositary to the party to whom ADRs are delivered against 
such deposits.
No UK stamp duty will be payable on any transfer of an ADR evidencing
an ADS, provided that the ADR (and any separate instrument of transfer)
is executed and retained at all times outside the UK and is not required
to be admitted in evidence in any proceedings in the United Kingdom. 
A transfer of an ADR evidencing an ADS in the United Kingdom could
attract stamp duty at a rate of 0.5%, rounded up to the nearest £5. Any
transfer (which will include a transfer from the Depositary to an ADS
holder) of the underlying ordinary shares could result in a stamp duty
liability at the rate of 0.5%, rounded up to the nearest £5. On a transfer
from a nominee to the beneficial owner (the nominee having at all times
held the ordinary shares on behalf of the beneficial owner) under which
no beneficial interest passes and which is neither a sale nor arises under
a contract of sale nor is in contemplation of sale, a fixed £5 stamp duty
will be payable. The amount of stamp duty or stamp duty reserve tax
payable is generally calculated at the applicable rate on the purchase
price of the ordinary shares.
Stamp duty reserve tax at a rate of 0.5% will be payable on any
agreement to transfer ordinary shares or any interest therein unless 
an instrument transferring the ordinary shares is executed and stamp 
duty at a rate of 0.5%, rounded up to the nearest £5 has been paid.
Stamp duty reserve tax will not be payable on any agreement to transfer
ADRs representing ADSs.

Independent auditor’s report to the shareholders of Hanson PLC
We have audited the parent company financial statements of Hanson PLC for the year ended December 31, 2005 which comprise the Balance
Sheet and the related notes I to VII. These parent Company financial statements have been prepared under the accounting policies set out therein.
We have also audited the information in the Directors’ Remuneration report that is described as having been audited. 
We have reported separately on the group financial statements of Hanson PLC for the year ended December 31, 2005.
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body, in accordance with Section 235 of the Companies Act 1985. Our audit work has
been undertaken so that we might state to the Company’s members those matters we are required to state to them in an auditors’ report and for no
other purpose. T o the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the Company and the
Company’s members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.
Respective responsibilities of Directors and auditors
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report and Form 20-F , the Directors’ Remuneration report and the parent Company financial
statements in accordance with applicable United Kingdom law and Accounting Standards (United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting
Practice) as set out in the Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities.
Our responsibility is to audit the parent Company financial statements and the part of the Directors’ Remuneration report to be audited in
accordance with relevant legal and regulatory requirements and International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland).
We report to you our opinion as to whether the parent Company financial statements give a true and fair view and whether the parent Company
financial statements and the part of the Directors’ Remuneration report to be audited have been properly prepared in accordance with the
Companies Act 1985. We also report to you if, in our opinion, the Directors’ Report is not consistent with the parent Company financial statements,
if the Company has not kept proper accounting records, if we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit, or if
information specified by law regarding Directors’ remuneration and other transactions is not disclosed.
We read other information contained in the Annual Report and Form 20 F and consider whether it is consistent with the audited parent Company
financial statements. The other information comprises only the Directors’ report, the unaudited part of the Directors’ Remuneration report, the
Chairman’s statement and the Review of operations and the Financial review. We consider the implications for our report if we become aware of 
any apparent misstatements or material inconsistencies with the parent Company financial statements. Our responsibilities do not extend to any
other information.
Basis of audit opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland) issued by the Auditing Practices Board. An audit
includes examination, on a test basis, of evidence relevant to the amounts and disclosures in the parent Company financial statements and the part
of the Directors’ Remuneration report to be audited. It also includes an assessment of the significant estimates and judgments made by the
Directors in the preparation of the parent Company financial statements, and of whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the Company’s
circumstances, consistently applied and adequately disclosed.
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the information and explanations which we considered necessary in order to provide us with
sufficient evidence to give reasonable assurance that the parent Company financial statements and the part of the Directors’ Remuneration report to
be audited are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or other irregularity or error. In forming our opinion we also evaluated the
overall adequacy of the presentation of information in the parent Company financial statements and the part of the Directors’ Remuneration report to
be audited.
Opinion
In our opinion:
– the parent Company financial statements give a true and fair view, in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting
Practice, of the state of the Company’s affairs as at December 31, 2005; and
– the parent Company financial statements and the part of the Directors’ Remuneration report to be audited have been properly prepared in
accordance with the Companies Act 1985.

Statement of Directors’ responsibilities in respect of the accounts
Company law requires the Directors to prepare accounts for each financial period which give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the
Company and of the profit or loss for that period. In preparing those accounts, the Directors are required to:
– select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;
– make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and prudent;
–state whether applicable accounting standards have been followed, subject to any material departures disclosed and explained in the accounts; and
– prepare the accounts on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Company will continue in business.
The Directors confirm that the accounts comply with the above requirements.
The Directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting records which disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of
the Company and to enable them to ensure that the accounts comply with the Companies Act 1985. They are also responsible for safeguarding the
assets of the Company and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.

I) Accounting Policies
a) Accounting convention
The accounts are prepared in accordance with UK accounting principles (including applicable accounting standards), using the historical
cost convention.
b) Profit and loss
As permitted by the exemption in Section 230 of the Companies Act 1985 the Company has not presented its own profit and loss account.
The loss for the year dealt with in the accounts of Hanson PLC was £11.2m (loss of £21.5m). After dividends of £136.2m (£127 .3m) the loss 
for the year was £147 .4m (loss of £148.8m).
c) Share-based payments
The cost of equity-settled transactions with employees, for awards granted after November 7 , 2002, is measured at fair value on the date of grant
and is recognised as an expense over the vesting period. Fair value is determined by an external valuer using an appropriate pricing model. In valuing
equity-settled transactions, no account is taken of any vesting conditions, other than conditions linked to the price of the shares of the Company
(market conditions).
For awards evaluated on non-market conditions or no performance criteria, an expense is ultimately only recognised for awards which vest. Where
an award is dependent upon a market condition, the cost of the award is recognised irrespective of whether the award vests unless the employee
leaves during the vesting period. At each balance sheet date before vesting, the cumulative expense is calculated representing the extent to which
the vesting period has expired and management’s best estimate of the number of equity instruments that will ultimately vest. The movement in
cumulative expense since the previous balance sheet date is recognised in the income statement, with a corresponding entry in equity. 
d) Dividends
Dividends attributable to the shareholders’ are taken directly to equity when declared. Interim dividends are recognised when paid.
e) Foreign currencies
Assets, liabilities, revenues and costs denominated in foreign currencies are recorded at the rate of exchange ruling at the date of the transactions.
Monetary assets and liabilities at the balance sheet date are re-translated at year end rates of exchange. Exchange differences arising are taken to
the profit and loss account.
f) Fixed asset investments
Fixed asset investments are stated at cost, except where it is required to reflect a provision for a permanent diminution in value. Hanson PLC – Company continued

I) Accounting Policies continued
g) Interest bearing loans and borrowings
All loans and borrowings are initially recognised at the fair value of the consideration received less directly attributable transaction costs. 
After initial recognition, interest-bearing loans and borrowings are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
Gains and losses are recognised in the profit and loss account when the liabilities are derecognised as well as through the amortisation process.
h) Own shares
Own equity instruments which are reacquired (treasury shares) are deducted from shareholders’ funds. No gain or loss is recognised in profit 
or loss on the purchase, sale, issue or cancellation of the Company’s own equity instruments.
i) Cash flow
The Company has taken advantage of the exemption available to it under FRS1 “Cash flow statements” not to prepare a statement of cash flows.
j) Changes in accounting policy
FRS 20 “Share-based payment”
FRS 20 is effective for accounting periods beginning on or after January 1,2005 and as such has been applied to these accounts. Under FRS 20,
the cost of equity-settled transactions with employees is recognised in the profit and loss account over their vesting period by reference to the fair
value at the date at which they are granted. The charge is only calculated on awards made after November 7 , 2002 as a result of the transition option
applied by the Company. 
FRS 21 “Events after the balance sheet date”
FRS 21 is effective for accounting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2005 and as such has been applied for the first time to these accounts.
Under FRS 21, the charge and liability for the final proposed dividend are not recognised in accounts until approved by the shareholders at the
AGM (declared). Previously, the dividend was recognised when proposed by the Directors.
FRS 26 “Financial Instruments: measurement” 
FRS 26 is effective for accounting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2005 and as such has been applied for the first time to these accounts.
Under FRS 26, all loans and borrowings are initially recognised at the fair value of the consideration received less directly attributable transaction
costs. After initial recognition, interest-bearing loans and borrowings are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest
method. Previously, interest in respect of the coupon that had been accrued at the balance sheet date was shown within ‘other creditors’. 
Impact on financial statements 
The 2004 accounts previously reported have been restated for the adoption of FRS 20, FRS 21 and FRS 26 as follows: ‘dividend accruals’ have
decreased by £93.4m; and the loss for the year has decreased by £91.7m. The net impact is to increase ‘shareholders’ funds’ as at December 31,
2004 by £93.4m.
