ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2017 08 ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2017 09
The acquisition of London & Colonial in late 
2016 has borne fruit during 2017 and has 
allowed us to quickly adapt to market changes 
so as to protect our new business stream. 
We have delivered a significant amount 
of cost savings by merging administrative 
processes across the Group whilst ensuring 
that the existing recurring revenue book 
continues to perform in a predictable and 
solid manner. We were also pleased to make 
the acquisition of Harbour Pensions Limited 
which subsequently completed post year end 
after receiving regulatory approval from the 
Malta Financial Services Authority.
As previously disclosed we have experienced 
regulatory issues in some of the jurisdictions 
in which we operate over the last few years. 
The Board’s objective is to address and 
minimise any risk in this area. Importantly, 
in early 2017 the appointment of a Head of 
Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) for the 
Group was made as part of further improving 
our corporate governance framework. Already 
in 2018 we have made important changes 
to our corporate governance arrangements, 
including proposed further appointments 
of NEDs to the subsidiary Boards, and the 
Group will be continuing to make more 
improvements over the rest of 2018.
One of the Group Board’s primary 
responsibilities is to ensure the provision of 
effective corporate governance. To this end, 
the Board is undertaking a full review of 
every aspect of governance well in advance 
of the AIM requirement to comply or explain 
against a recognised Corporate Governance 
Code by September 2018.
I am particularly pleased that my long term 
views regarding the potential benefits of re-
locating the Group head office from Gibraltar 
to the UK is now well underway. I feel that 
the business becoming more UK orientated 
will further build investor confidence, improve 
efficiency, and open further UK business 
opportunities for the Group.
The Board has a medium term vision and 
a strategy to continue to deliver enhanced 
profitability, whilst at the same time de-
risking the business further by continuing 
to expand the Group’s product range and 
its intermediary base whilst keeping costs 
firmly under control.
Finally, I have chaired the Board for the past 
three years, having also served as a Non-
Executive for the four years preceding that, 
and have enjoyed my time working with 
the team to make STM a success. However, 
after seven years of service I have made 
the decision to retire and enjoy more time 
with my family, and I therefore will not be 
standing for re-election at the forthcoming 
AGM in May 2018, with my retirement 
becoming effective on 23 May 2018. This 
in turn leaves the Board perfectly placed for 
the appointment of one or more UK based 
Non-Executive Directors to reflect the new 
London head office status, with the Board 
having already begun the recruitment process.
I would like to take this opportunity to 
personally thank all of the Group’s Directors, 
executive and staff for their efforts in making 
2017 such a success, and will avidly follow 
STM’s continued success in the future.

IT GIVES ME GREAT PLEASURE TO PRESENT THE FINANCIAL RESULTS 
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2017 , WHICH REPRESENT A 
STRONG SET OF FULL YEAR RESULTS AND A RECORD YEAR OF 
PROFITABILITY FOR THE GROUP. ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2017 10
IT IS A PROUD FEELING TO BE ABLE TO STATE 
THAT WE HAVE DELIVERED RECORD PROFITS 
DURING 2017, SIGNIFICANTLY UP ON 2016. 
ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2017 10
“
” ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2017 11
The second year of my tenure has certainly 
been more eventful than I would have wished. 
Despite some unexpected and significant 
challenges, it is a proud feeling to be able to 
state that we have delivered record profits 
during 2017, significantly up on 2016. 
STM’s acquisition of London & Colonial 
Holdings Limited (LCH) in late 2016 has 
played a key part in helping us to adapt and 
widen our product offerings to the expatriate 
market; which was a necessity following 
the UK Spring Budget that announced an 
Overseas Tax Charge of 25% on certain 
overseas pension transfers. As stated at 
the time, this was expected to affect circa 
80% of our new business volumes for our 
international pension products. 
This estimate proved correct but due to 
management’s innovation and flexibility, we 
were able to come to the market in short order 
with an alternative, UK regulated, product to 
service our international distribution network. 
This has seen most of this lost new QROPS 
business, by both policy number and revenue, 
replaced by our International SIPP offering.
With a significant amount of new business 
falling under our UK regulated entity, this in 
turn has given us a more UK centric focus, 
and has contributed to the decision to move 
our Group head office from Gibraltar to the 
UK from January 2018. 
As part of this move, it allows the Group 
Executive function to recruit from a larger 
population and will also see some additional 
appointments to our PLC Board which will 
further strengthen our depth of knowledge 
and capabilities.
Certain STM Gibraltar regulated entities have 
been working in a collaborative way with 
the GFSC on a third-party review (a Skilled 
Person Review) being carried out under 
Section 7 of the Financial Services (Information 
Gathering and Co-operation) Act 2013, on 
certain aspects of the various businesses 
(the ‘Report’). It is expected that the Report 
will be finalised by 30 April 2018 and will 
include recommendations, if appropriate. The 
Group has no appetite for risk in respect of its 
relationships and dealings with the regulators 
and we are determined that we will move 
the Group forward in line with that level of 
risk appetite. 
Overall, it is very clear that our underlying 
business continues to perform according 
to plan, demonstrating the quality and 
predictability of our recurring revenue streams 
which are key component parts of any robust 
business model.
During the last quarter of 2017, we signed 
the Sale and Purchase Agreement for the 
acquisition of Harbour Pensions Limited. 
Regulatory approval came through in February 
2018 allowing completion to occur. We are 
now in the process of integrating this business 
with that of our existing Malta business, which 
once complete, we expect to result in a further 
increase of some £0.4 million profit before tax 
per annum to the Malta operation.
On behalf of the Board and the Company, a 
special thank you goes out to Mike Riddell, 
STM’s Chairman for the past three years and 
Board Member for seven years, who is not 
putting himself forward for re-election having 
decided that it is time for him to leave his 
working life behind and enjoy more time 
with his family. His stewardship in guiding 
us through the re-invention phase of our 
recent history has been invaluable, and has 
protected and enhanced shareholder value 
for all concerned. 
CHIEF EXECUTIVE 
OFFICER’S STATEMENT
ALAN KENTISH
Chief Executive Officer
I AM PLEASED TO PRESENT THE ANNUAL RESULTS FOR 
STM GROUP PLC FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2017. ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2017 12
OPERATIONAL OVERVIEW
PENSIONS 
Our pensions businesses have all seen significant changes to their 
modus operandi following the UK Spring Budget. 
Total revenue across our pensions businesses amounted to £10.2 
million (2016: £9.2 million) and accounted for 47% of total Group 
revenue (2016: 52%). 
As predicted since the UK Spring Budget, our Gibraltar operation 
has seen almost no new business with regards to ROPS, whilst 
Malta is now only receiving new business from the EEA. 
Conversely, our UK SIPP business has become the focus of new 
business growth.
To put this in context, for the nine months following the Budget, 
new business numbers were 217 ROPS (2016: 1,224) administered 
by our Malta and Gibraltar offices and 755 SIPPs (2016: 162) 
administered from our UK operations.
Malta remains the largest of our three jurisdictions with pension 
turnover of £6.1 million (2016: £6.5 million), with Gibraltar 
generating £2.6 million (2016: £2.4 million) of turnover, and finally, 
in its first full year under STM’s ownership, the UK generated 
£1.5 million of revenue (2016: £0.3 million). 
An important KPI remains the annual recurring revenue statistic 
which has been determined as the contractual element of any 
trustee fee due or any fees under the life assurance policies, which 
are billed on an annual basis. For 2017 this amounted to £9.6 
million (2016: £8.5 million) which represents 95% (2016: 93%) 
of total pension revenue, giving a highly visible and predictable 
future revenue stream. 
LIFE ASSURANCE
The acquisition of London & Colonial in late 2016, and with it 
the Gibraltar based life assurance company (LCA), has allowed 
STM to significantly grow its life assurance business.
This is seen from the 2017 combined revenue figure of £5.9 
million as compared to £2.8 million for 2016.
Pleasingly, organic growth for STM Life during the year has 
delivered a 26% uplift, to generate turnover for 2017 of £2.4 
million (2016: £1.9 million). Within this revenue figure, recurring 
revenue, annual fees and investment income amounted to £1.8 
million compared to £1.4 million in 2016. This provides a steady 
and highly visible annuity income stream.
In addition, LCA has performed as expected with its long standing 
and predictable customer base delivering a revenue of £2.2 million 
for the year, with a further release from technical reserves of 
£1.3 million (2016: £0.5 million) as a result of the reduction in 
the administrative costs per policy. 
CORPORATE AND TRUSTEE SERVICES
Turnover from the Corporate and Trustee Services (CTS) division 
for the year was £4.3 million (2016: £4.4 million) thus accounting 
for 20% of the Group’s total turnover (2016: 25%). This business is 
generated in Jersey and Gibraltar, with Jersey revenue accounting 
for circa 57% (2016: 56%) of the CTS business at £2.5 million 
(2016: £2.5 million) and Gibraltar generating turnover of £1.8 
million (2016: £1.9 million).
As noted in previous years’ reports, the CTS environment and 
sector remains challenging, and it is accepted by the Group that 
this will be a difficult segment to grow organically. 
OTHER TRADING DIVISIONS AND NEW 
INITIATIVES
Trading in other divisions, which are mainly insurance management 
and the Spanish office, was broadly in line with management 
expectations. These are expected to continue at similar levels 
going forward having generated revenue of £1.2 million in the 
year (2016: £1.1 million). 
FINANCIAL REVIEW
PERFORMANCE IN THE YEAR
Profitability has seen a step change in 2017, compared to that of 
2016, but reflects the hard work of building the infrastructure 
and business development function in previous years. 
Clearly, the integration of the LCH acquisition has enabled us 
to restructure the cost base of those businesses acquired and 
ensured that profit margins were enhanced.
Group revenue for 2017 amounted to £21.5 million (2016: £17.4 
million), and as anticipated EBITDA (Earnings before interest, 
taxation, depreciation and amortisation) has increased by 55% 
from £3.1 million in 2016 to £4.8 million in 2017. 
Reassuringly, the amount of recurring annuity revenue business 
continues to increase and still accounts for 75% of 2017 total 
revenues (2016: 75%). 
Finance costs amounted to £0.3 million (2016: £0.1 million) and 
reflects the debt financing in place for the LCH acquisition. The 
depreciation and amortisation charge has in turn increased as a 
result of amortising the client portfolio acquired with LCH and 
the investment in offices across various jurisdictions. This is £0.5 
million in 2017 (2016: £0.3 million). 
Profit before tax was £4.0 million for the year being a pleasing uplift 
of 43% above the 2016 PBT result of £2.8 million notwithstanding 
one-off costs and the technical reserve release referred to above.
TAX CHARGE AND EARNINGS PER SHARE
The tax charge for the year was £0.1 million (2016: £0.4 million).
The tax charge for the year has been impacted by the refund 
received in Malta on tax due on dividends paid to companies 
outside the Group. Whilst the corporate rate on Malta profits is 
35%, the refund is 30% on tax due on dividends.
In Malta’s infancy and growing stage, the tax charge was higher 
than the refund as profits were higher than dividends. This year, 
dividends have been in excess of profits due to the payment of 
a dividend from last year’s reserves. Hence the refund is higher 
than the charge. But this is a one-off and as profits in Malta 
become consistent year on year, the position will stabilise and 
the Group’s effective rate will remain at circa 15%. 
This significantly lower than expected tax charge together with 
the increased profitability has resulted in a healthy uplift to the 
earnings per share from 3.99p in 2016 to 6.69p in 2017. Diluted 
earnings per share takes into consideration the long term incentive 
CHIEF EXECUTIVE 
OFFICER’S STATEMENT
ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2017 12 ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2017 13
plan approved by the Company as approved by the shareholders 
at the Annual General Meeting on 18 May 2016 which stipulates 
a maximum dilution factor of 5% resulting in diluted EPS of 
6.37p (2016: 3.87p).
CASHFLOWS
Overall net cash balances at the year end have continued to 
increase, resulting in cash and cash equivalents of £18.4 million 
at 31 December 2017 (2016: £11.9 million). Whilst part of this 
increase is due to cash generated from operating activities of 
£4.0 million (2016: £1.4 million), part of this is also as a result of 
the sale of investments acquired as part of the LCH acquisition.
During the year the Group also made the final deferred 
consideration payment on the LCH acquisition of £0.8 million, 
having accrued £1.15 million in the previous years’ accounts. 
The Company continues to have bank borrowings of £3.3 million 
taken out in October 2016 for the purposes of the acquisition 
of LCH with repayments being quarterly over the forthcoming 
two years and as such the first repayment was in January 2018.
As with most services businesses, the Group had accrued income 
in the form of work performed for clients but not yet billed at 
the year end of £0.9 million (2016: £1.2 million). The Group 
policy for pensions is to recognise this accrued income over the 
period from when an application has been received up to the 
point when the pension funds are received, at which point the 
invoice is raised. The decrease in accrued income this year is 
predominantly as a result of the decrease in QROPS new business 
in favour of the International SIPP accrued income which is much 
quicker to convert. 
Deferred income (a liability in the statement of financial position), 
representing fees billed in advance yet to be credited to the 
statement of total comprehensive income, has remained consistent 
with the balance as at 31 December 2016 of £3.8 million. 
Both the accrued and deferred income will be invoiced and earned 
in 2018 thus providing visibility on fees for the forthcoming year.
Other large balance sheet items relate to trade and other 
receivables which stood at £5.6 million as at 31 December 2017 
(2016: £5.2 million). Of this amount, trade receivables at the year 
end stood at £3.4 million (2016: £3.4 million). 
DIVIDEND POLICY
The Group Board continues to follow its progressive dividend 
policy having re-commenced paying dividends in March 2016. In 
this regard, I am pleased to advise that the Board is recommending 
the payment of a final dividend of 1.2p per share (2016: 1.0p 
per share). This together with the interim dividend paid of 0.6p 
in November 2017 (2016: 0.5p) makes a proposed total dividend 
for the year of 1.8p per share (2016: 1.5p). 
Subject to approval at the Company’s Annual General Meeting, 
the final dividend will be paid on 27 June 2018 to shareholders on 
the register at the close of business on 1 June 2018. The ordinary 
shares will become ex-dividend on 31 May 2018.
OUTLOOK 
2017 has demonstrated that STM is flexible and able to take 
advantage of the opportunities that present themselves, whilst 
managing the challenges that will invariably manifest from 
time to time. To see 80% of new pensions business literally fall 
away overnight in March 2017 and still meet original market 
expectations is testament to that. 
Expectations are that 2018 new business volumes and client 
retention rates will remain in line with those of 2017 post the 
UK Budget. In addition, we continue to seek earnings enhancing 
acquisitions in the ROPS and UK SIPP sector. We are confident 
in the Group’s prospects and that we will deliver trading results 
in line with our previous management expectations for the new 
financial year.
Furthermore, our key deliverable for the current year is to continue 
to build on our governance framework and to place more reliance 
on IT efficiencies.
Our medium term strategy continues to move forward, with 
an emphasis on improving profit margins, as well as looking to 
diversify our product range both within the expatriate, as well as 
UK market. In turn, this will allow us to expand our intermediary 
base, all of which continues to re-enforce the robustness of the 
business model. 
I would like to take this opportunity to thank all my STM colleagues 
for their continued hard work and professionalism in carrying 
out their duties. 
I look forward to updating the market on our achievements 
during the course of the coming year.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS
ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2017 15 ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2017 16
Notes
a. The Executive Directors are included within an Annual Bonus Scheme that is principally driven by year-on-year increase 
in earnings per share with a minimum growth of 20%. As such this formula derives a potential bonus payout for the 
year. However, given the exceptional circumstances arising at the end of the financial year it has been agreed between 
the Executive Directors and the Remuneration Committee that it would be appropriate to defer the allocation of this 
payment until certain matters have been concluded upon. No bonus was due for the year ended 31 December 2016 as 
the minimum target was not met.
b. No Directors received any benefits in the form of either pension contributions or share based incentives.
c. Greystone Trust Company Limited invoices the Company for the Director services provided by Michael Riddell.
d. Robin Ellison was appointed on 22 December 2016.
e. Malcolm Berryman was appointed on 1 May 2016.
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report and the financial statements 
in accordance with applicable law and regulations.
Company law requires the Directors to prepare financial statements for each financial year. 
Under that law, the Directors have elected to prepare the financial statements in accordance 
with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union 
and interpretations adopted by the International Accounting Standard Board (IASB). Under 
company law, the Directors must not approve the financial statements unless they are satisfied 
that they give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Group and Parent Company 
and of the profit or loss of the Group for that period. 
In preparing these financial statements, the Directors are required to: 
• properly select and apply accounting policies;
• present information, including accounting policies, in a manner that provides relevant, 
reliable, comparable and understandable information; 
• provide additional disclosures when compliance with the specific requirements in IFRSs 
as adopted by the European Union are insufficient to enable users to understand the 
impact of particular transactions, other events and conditions on the entity’s financial 
position and financial performance; and
• make an assessment of the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern.
The Directors are responsible for keeping reliable accounting records that are sufficient to 
show and explain the Company’s transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any 
time the financial position of the Company and enable them to ensure that the financial 
statements comply with the Companies Act 2006. They are also responsible for the system of 
internal control, for safeguarding the assets of the Company and hence for taking reasonable 
steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the corporate and financial 
information included on the Company’s website. Legislation in the Isle of Man governing 
the preparation and dissemination of financial statements may differ from legislation in 
other jurisdictions.

The Board will at all times consider this to be 
best practice, and in this regard will always 
attempt to adhere to such practices where 
practical, and that implementation of such 
practices contributes to a good governance 
framework that will help the Group to meet 
its strategic objectives. However, the Board 
also recognises that, given the size of the 
Group and the nature of its operations, there 
will be occasions where it is unlikely to meet 
such guidance.
The Board is responsible for establishing the 
strategic direction of the Group, monitoring 
the Group’s trading performance and 
appraising and executing development and 
acquisition opportunities. During the year 
the Company held regular Board meetings 
at which financial and other reports were 
considered and, where appropriate, voted on 
and has also held ad hoc meetings as required 
to deal with specific issues. 
Details of the Directors’ beneficial interests 
in ordinary shares is set out in the Directors’ 
Report. The Directors intend to comply with 
Rule 21 of the AIM Rules and the Market 
Abuse Regulations 2014 relating to Directors’ 
dealings and will take all reasonable steps to 
ensure compliance by any employees of the 
Company to whom regulations apply. The 
Company has, in addition, adopted the Share 
Dealing Code for dealings in its ordinary shares 
by Directors and senior employees.
The Board comprises two Executive and three 
independent Non-Executive Directors and 
the Board committees are comprised only of 
Non-Executive Directors. The Non-Executive 
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer have 
separate and clearly defined roles. The Chairman 
is responsible for running the Board and the 
Chief Executive Officer is responsible for the 
day-to-day management of the Group and for 
delivering the key objectives of the business. 
The Board meets at least four times during 
the year. To enable the Board to discharge 
its duties, all Directors receive appropriate 
and timely information. Briefing papers are 
distributed to all Directors in advance of the 
Board meetings. There is a formal schedule of 
matters reserved to the Board which include 
the determination of strategy, approval of 
acquisitions, approval of budget and major 
capital expenditure. 
At Board meetings, the agenda normally 
comprises a review of the management 
financial statements, a CEO review of 
operations, a review of acquisitions and an 
update on the progress of the Group’s other 
strategic objectives. 
The Board has established an Audit & Risk 
Committee and a Remuneration Committee, 
both with formally delegated duties and 
responsibilities. Both Committees comprise 
Malcolm Berryman, as the Chairman, Michael 
Riddell and Robin Ellison.
AUDIT & RISK COMMITTEE
The Audit & Risk Committee reviews the 
integrity of the financial statements of the 
Group, announcements relating to financial 
performance, accounting policies, the 
application of critical accounting judgements 
and practices, the operation of internal controls, 
the effectiveness of the financial reporting 
policies and systems and has delegated power 
from the Board to exercise the power from 
shareholders to agree fees for external auditors. 
It is responsible each year for satisfying itself on 
the independence and objectivity of external 
auditors. The Audit & Risk Committee meets 
at least three times a year.
The Audit & Risk Committee reviews the 
Group’s risk appetite and framework, its 
policies, methodologies, systems, processes 
and procedures and the monitoring of all 
these areas (through a three lines of defence 
model, the first line being the business 
systems and controls in place to prevent 
and detect errors, the second provided by 
compliance monitoring and the third by 
internal and external audit review).
The Audit & Risk Committee has primary 
responsibility for the Group’s Risk Appetite 
Statement which sets out the Group’s attitude 
to risk and the limits of acceptable risk taking. 
The Board is committed to achieving high standards of corporate governance, 
integrity and business ethics. Under the AIM Rules the Group is not required 
to comply with the provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code issued 
by the Financial Reporting Council in September 2014 (the ‘Code’). The Board 
has taken into consideration the Guidance for Smaller Quoted Companies in 
the code produced by the Quoted Companies Alliance. ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2017 18
AUDIT & RISK COMMITTEE 
(CONTINUED)
The Audit & Risk Committee establishes the high level 
qualitative Risk Appetite Statement for the Group and 
requires the subsidiaries to link their own risk appetite 
to the Group version. The subsidiaries are required to 
identify and manage Key Risk Indicators. The statement is 
subject to annual review by the Audit & Risk Committee 
and the Group Board. The Audit & Risk Committee makes 
recommendations to the Board in respect of all risks faced 
by the Group outside of its declared risk appetite.
The Audit & Risk Committee is responsible for the risk 
framework with all risks identified being recorded in the 
Corporate Risk Register and reviewed by the Audit & Risk 
Committee on a biannual basis.
REMUNERATION COMMITTEE
The Remuneration Committee meets at least twice in 
each year and at such other times as the Chairman of the 
Remuneration Committee sees fit. The Chairman of the 
Remuneration Committee is appointed by the Board. The 
quorum for the Remuneration Committee is two.
The duties of the Committee are to:
• determine and agree with the Board the policy for the 
remuneration of the Chairman, Executive Directors and 
other members of the Group Executive team;
• determine individual remuneration packages including 
bonuses, incentive payments, share options and any 
other benefits;
• determine the contractual terms on termination and 
individual termination payment;
• be informed of and advise on changes in benefit 
structures in the Group; and
• agree the policy for approving expense claims of the 
Chief Executive and the Chairman of the Board.
The Directors do not consider that, given the size of the 
Board, it is appropriate at this stage to have a Nomination 
Committee.
PRINCIPAL RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES
The Directors of STM Group Plc confirm that they carry out 
an assessment of the principal risks facing the Company, 
including those that could threaten its business model, 
performance and solvency.
Through the Group Audit & Risk Committee, the Board retains 
ultimate responsibility for the Group’s risk management 
framework and appetite. The risk management function 
oversees the implementation of these new Group policies 
throughout each of the jurisdictions that the Group operates 
in and across its whole product range. The compliance 
functions in each of the jurisdictions provides assurance 
to the Group Audit & Risk Committee on regulatory and 
reputational risk through the completion of an annual 
compliance monitoring plan. 
The intention is that the Group’s risk management 
framework and appetite will be embedded in the Group 
(and subsidiaries’) management and governance processes 
and will be overseen by the Board.

INDEPENDENT AUDITORS’ 
REPORT TO THE MEMBERS 
OF STM GROUP PLC
REPORT ON THE AUDIT OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
OPINION
In our opinion:
• the financial statements give a true and fair view 
of the state of the Group’s and of the Parent 
Company’s affairs as at 31 December 2017 and of 
the Group’s profit for the year then ended;
• the Group financial statements have been properly 
prepared in accordance with International Financial 
Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the 
European Union;
• the Parent Company financial statements have 
been properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs 
as adopted by the European Union, as applicable 
to an Isle Of Man company; and
• the financial statements have been prepared in 
accordance with the requirements of the Isle of 
Man Companies Act 2006.
We have audited the financial statements of STM Group 
Plc (the ‘Parent Company’) and its subsidiaries (the ‘Group’) 
which comprise:
• the consolidated statement of comprehensive income;
• the consolidated and Parent Company statement of 
financial position;
• the consolidated and Parent Company statements of 
changes in equity;
• the consolidated statement of cash flow; and
• the related Notes 1 to 27.
The financial reporting framework that has been applied in 
their preparation is applicable law and IFRSs as adopted by 
the European Union and, as regards the Parent Company 
financial statements, as applicable to an Isle of Man 
company.
BASIS FOR OPINION
We conducted our audit in accordance with International 
Standards on Auditing (UK) (ISAs (UK)) and applicable 
law. Our responsibilities under those standards are further 
described in the auditors’ responsibilities for the audit of 
the financial statements section of our report.
We are independent of the Group and the Parent Company 
in accordance with the ethical requirements that are relevant 
to our audit of the financial statements in the UK, including 
the FRC’s Ethical Standard as applied to listed entities, 
and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in 
accordance with these requirements. We believe that 
the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and 
appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.
SUMMARY OF OUR 
AUDIT APPROACH
KEY AUDIT 
MATTERS
The key audit matters that we identified 
in the current year were:
• Revenue recognition
• Insurance technical reserve
• Recoverability of trade debtors & 
accrued income
MATERIALITY The materiality that we used in the 
current year was £400,000 which was 
determined on the basis of pre-tax 
profit. 
SCOPING We have identified reporting components 
across the regulated and trading entities 
within the jurisdictions in which the 
Company operates. The regulated and 
trading entities in Gibraltar, Malta, Jersey 
and the UK are considered of individual 
financial significance to the reported 
results of STM Group Plc (the ‘Group’).
These components were subjected to 
audits for Group reporting purposes.
Additionally, we have completed specific 
audit procedures in respect of two 
further components which, although 
not financially significant, did present 
specific audit risks which needed to be 
addressed. The components within the 
scope of our audit procedures account 
for 99.7% of the Group’s revenue and 
98.9% of pre-tax profits and losses.  ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2017 21
INDEPENDENT AUDITORS’ 
REPORT TO THE MEMBERS 
OF STM GROUP PLC
CONCLUSIONS RELATING 
TO GOING CONCERN
We are required by ISAs (UK) to report in respect of the 
following matters where:
• the Directors’ use of the going concern basis of 
accounting in preparation of the financial statements is 
not appropriate; or
• the Directors have not disclosed in the financial 
statements any identified material uncertainties that 
may cast significant doubt about the Group’s or the 
Parent Company’s ability to continue to adopt the going 
concern basis of accounting for a period of at least twelve 
months from the date when the financial statements are 
authorised for issue.
We have nothing to report in respect of these matters.
KEY AUDIT MATTERS
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional 
judgement, were of most significance in our audit of the 
financial statements of the current period and include the 
most significant assessed risks of material misstatement 
(whether or not due to fraud) that we identified. These 
matters included those which had the greatest effect on: 
the overall audit strategy; the allocation of resources in the 
audit; and directing the efforts of the engagement team.
These matters were addressed in the context of our audit 
of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming our 
opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion 
on these matters.
REVENUE RECOGNITION
KEY AUDIT MATTER DESCRIPTION
The Group’s gross revenue as detailled in Note 5 to the 
financial statements totalled £21.5 million for the year ended 
2017 (2016 year end: £17.4 million). Revenue is derived from 
the provision of services and is recognised in the statement 
of comprehensive income in proportion to the stage of 
completion of the services at the reporting date on an 
accruals basis. STM Group Plc has four reportable segments: 
Corporate Trustee Services, Pensions, Life Assurance and 
Other Services.
Revenue derived from pension services is split between the 
establishment fee and the management fee. The revenue 
recognition policy from pension services and administration 
fees is detailed in Note 2d, ‘Use of estimates and judgements’ 
as follows:
Revenue: a) In the first year of membership the establishment 
and management fees are recognised in full at the time of 
processing the application; b) from the second year onwards 
the recognition of 50% of the annual fees at the time of 
invoicing and the deferral of the remainder from pension 
trustee and administration fees.
Our key audit matter was pinpointed to the judgements made 
by management in determining the timing of when the work 
and the stage of completion for each performance obligation 
have been fulfilled resulting in revenue being recognised.
HOW THE SCOPE OF OUR 
AUDIT RESPONDED TO THE 
KEY AUDIT MATTER
We performed a walkthrough of the revenue recognitions 
process and have assessed the design and implementation 
of key controls in process. We have reviewed management’s 
assessment as to the timing of when the contractual 
performance obligations are met. We have challenged 
management’s assumptions by reviewing contracts to 
understand and verify the performance obligations detailed 
within these. Additionally, we have reviewed the client 
service logs to assess the timing of when services are 
performed throughout the first and subsequent periods. 
For a sample of clients we verified the service log for the 
number of services provided before and after invoicing. In 
addition we verified the WIP recorded during the period 
to assess the time spent on the onboarding process for 
new clients.
KEY OBSERVATIONS
Based on our work performed, we observed that the 
judgements applied were appropriate and the revenue 
recognition policy is correctly applied. 
INSURANCE TECHNICAL RESERVE
KEY AUDIT MATTER DESCRIPTION
The Group’s insurance technical reserve as disclosed in 
Note 20 to the financial statements totalled £1.5 million 
for the year ended 2017 (2016 year end: £2.8 million). The 
insurance technical reserve is calculated based on actuarial 
assumptions by the insurance companies’ appointed 
independent actuary. The measurement is highly subjective. 
Specifically, assumptions in relation to the lapse rate involve 
significant judgemental considerations. The insurance 
technical reserve is deemed an area of judgement in Note 
2, ‘Use of estimates and judgement’. ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2017 22
HOW THE SCOPE OF OUR 
AUDIT RESPONDED TO THE 
KEY AUDIT MATTER
We have assessed the design and implementation of the 
key controls which management performs in relation to 
insurance reserving. We tested the completeness and 
accuracy of the underlying data used in the actuarial 
calculations by performing reconciliations of the relevant 
data back to audited financial information.
We have involved our Deloitte actuarial specialists to 
challenge the methodology applied and the key assumptions 
and judgements taken in determining the level of provision 
required. The review consisted of a re-performance of 
material areas of the model used by the client and a review 
of the assumptions and judgements for consistency and 
comparison to industry benchmarks.
KEY OBSERVATIONS
Based on the audit procedures we have concluded the 
assumptions relating to expense and lapse rates are 
appropriate and that the insurance technical reserve 
recorded appears reasonable.
RECOVERABILITY OF TRADE 
DEBTORS & ACCRUED INCOME
KEY AUDIT MATTER DESCRIPTION
Trade debtors and accrued income as disclosed in Note 15 
to the financial statements totalled £3.4 million and £0.9 
million respectively for the year ended 2017 (2016 year end: 
£3.4 million and £1.2 million respectively). They represent 
a significant proportion of the Group balance sheet and 
there is high level of judgement involved in determining 
their recoverability, due to the risk of inadequate liquidity 
and resources available in the underlying client structures. 
Accrued income is recorded at the staff charge-out rates in 
force at the reporting date, less any specific provisions against 
the value of accrued income where recovery will not be made 
in full. Accrued income is deemed an area of judgement in 
Note 2, ‘Use of estimates and judgement’.
There is a risk that the assets on the balance sheet are not 
billable or recoverable from clients at the reporting date and 
provisions recorded are not reflective of this fact.
HOW THE SCOPE OF OUR 
AUDIT RESPONDED TO THE 
KEY AUDIT MATTER
We have assessed the design and implementation of key 
controls over the financial reporting process.
We have focused on the appropriate ageing of billed and 
unbilled balances recorded in the financial accounts and review 
of these aged positions. We have extended the scope of our 
work on aged balances and, on a sample basis, have challenged 
the validity of the recorded debtors, accrued income and 
completeness of provisions by reviewing correspondence with 
clients, reviewing historical payment patterns and interviewing 
client relationship managers.
KEY OBSERVATIONS
Based on our work performed, we observed that the 
judgements applied were appropriate and recoverability 
of trade debtors & accrued income appears reasonable.
OUR APPLICATION OF MATERIALITY
We define materiality as the magnitude of misstatement 
in the financial statements that makes it probable that the 
economic decisions of a reasonably knowledgeable person 
would be changed or influenced. We use materiality both 
in planning the scope of our audit work and in evaluating 
the results of our work.
Based on our professional judgement, we determined 
materiality for the financial statements as a whole as follows:

MATERIALITY
10% of pre-tax profit rounded down to the nearest

We determine performance materiality at a level 
lower than materiality to reduce the probability 
that, in aggregate, uncorrected misstatements 
exceed the materiality for the financial statements 
as a whole. Group performance materiality was 
set at £280,000 for the 2017 audit. 
10% pre-tax profit rounded down to the nearest

We determine performance materiality at a level

set at £83,000 for the 2017 audit.
RATIONALE 
FOR THE 
BENCHMARK 
APPLIED
We consider profit before taxation to be the critical 
benchmark of the performance of the Group 
and consider this measure to be suitable having 
compared to other benchmarks: our materiality 
equates to 1.9% of revenue and 1.3% of equity. 
10% of pre-tax profit was taken as there have been 
no significant changes in the Group’s business 
and is consistent with the other benchmarks 
considered.

We agreed with the Audit & Risk Committee that we would report to the Committee all audit differences in excess of

grounds. We also report to the Audit & Risk Committee on disclosure matters that we identified when assessing the 
overall presentation of the financial statements.
AN OVERVIEW OF THE 
SCOPE OF OUR AUDIT
Our Group audit was scoped by obtaining an understanding 
of the Group and its environment, including Group-wide 
controls, and assessing the risks of material misstatement 
at the Group level. The Group operates through a number 
of legal entities which form reporting components based 
on service lines. Audits for Group reporting purposes were 
performed over the significant legal entities covering the 
main trading jurisdictions, namely the regulated and trading 
entities in Gibraltar, Jersey, Malta and the UK. Analytical 
procedures were also performed on trading entities in Spain. 
Combined, these entities represent 99.7% of revenues and 
98.9% of profit before tax. The Group audit team approved 
component materiality levels, which ranged from £119,000 
to £175,000 having regard to the mix of size and risk profile 
of the Group across the components.
The work on all components was performed by component 
audit teams in Gibraltar, UK, Jersey and Malta under the 
direction and supervision of the Group engagement partner. 
The Group engagement partner visited the Gibraltar 
component which is the Group’s main operating jurisdiction.
Various telephone conference meetings were also held with 
the auditors in all the jurisdictions tested the consolidation . 
process and carried out analytical procedures to confirm our 
conclusion that there were no significant risks of material 
misstatement throughout the audit process covering 
planning and fieldwork. At the parent entity level we also 
tested the consolidation process and carried out analytical 
procedures to confirm our conclusion that there were no 
significant risks of material misstatement.
OTHER INFORMATION
The Directors are responsible for the other information. 
The other information comprises the information included 
in the Annual Report, other than the financial statements 
and our auditors’ report thereon.
Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover 
the other information and, except to the extent otherwise 
explicitly stated in our report, we do not express any form 
of assurance conclusion thereon.
In connection with our audit of the financial statements, 
our responsibility is to read the other information and, 
in doing so, consider whether the other information is 
materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our 
knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to 
be materially misstated.
If we identify such material inconsistencies or apparent 
material misstatements, we are required to determine 
whether there is a material misstatement in the financial 
statements or a material misstatement of the other 
information. If, based on the work we have performed, 
we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this 
other information, we are required to report that fact.
We have nothing to report in respect of these matters.
RESPONSIBILITIES OF DIRECTORS
As explained more fully in the statement of Directors’ 
responsibilities, the Directors are responsible for the 
preparation of the financial statements and for being 
satisfied that they give a true and fair view, and for such 
internal control as the Directors determine is necessary to 
enable the preparation of financial statements that are free 
from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2017 24
RESPONSIBILITIES OF 
DIRECTORS (CONTINUED)
In preparing the financial statements, the Directors are 
responsible for assessing the Group’s and the Parent 
Company’s ability to continue as a going concern, 
disclosing as applicable, matters related to going concern 
and using the going concern basis of accounting unless 
the Directors either intend to liquidate the Group or 
the Parent Company or to cease operations, or have 
no realistic alternative but to do so.
AUDITORS’ RESPONSIBILITIES 
FOR THE AUDIT OF THE 
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance 
about whether the financial statements as a whole 
are free from material misstatement, whether due 
to fraud or error, and to issue an auditors’ report 
that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a 
high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that 
an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs (UK) will 
always detect a material misstatement when it exists. 
Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are 
considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, 
they could reasonably be expected to influence the 
economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these 
financial statements.
A further description of our responsibilities for the 
audit of the financial statements is located on the 
Financial Reporting Council’s website at: www.frc.org.

STATEMENT OF CONSOLIDATED CHANGES IN EQUITY
STATEMENT OF COMPANY CHANGES IN EQUITY ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2017 30
1. REPORTING ENTITY
STM Group Plc (the ‘Company’) is a company incorporated and domiciled in the Isle of Man and is traded on the London 
Stock Exchange AIM. The address of the Company’s registered office is 18 Athol Street, Douglas, Isle of Man, IM1 1JA. The 
consolidated financial statements of the Group as at, and for the year ended, 31 December 2017 comprise the Company and 
its subsidiaries as per Note 26 (together referred to as the ‘Group’ and individually as ‘Group entities’) and the Group’s interest 
in associates and jointly controlled entities. The Group is primarily involved in financial services.
2. BASIS OF PREPARATION
The financial information has been prepared on the basis of the accounting policies set out in Note 3.
a. Statement of compliance
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) 
as adopted by the European Union and interpretations adopted by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) and 
in accordance with Isle of Man law.
b. Going concern basis of accounting
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, as it is the Directors’ opinion that the 
Group will be able to meet all liabilities as they fall due. This opinion is derived at from financial and cash projections for the 
forthcoming twelve months.
c. Functional and presentational currency
These consolidated financial statements are presented in Pound Sterling (£) which is the Company’s functional currency.
d. Use of estimates and judgements
The preparation of financial statements requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect 
the application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses. Actual results may 
differ from these estimates.
Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in 
the period in which the estimate is revised and in any future periods affected.
The estimates, assumptions and key judgement areas which have a significant risk of resulting in a material adjustment to the 
carrying value of assets and liabilities are included in the following Notes: 
Note 3c Revenue: a) In the first year of membership the establishment and management fees are recognised 
in full at the time of processing the application; b) from the second year onwards the recognition 
of 50% of the annual fees at the time of invoicing and the deferral of the remainder from pension 
trustee and administration fees
Judgement
Note 3d Accrued income: the recognition of income prior to the submission of an invoice based on the 
estimated amount recoverable for work performed before each year end
Estimate
Note 3s Contingent liabilities Judgement
Notes 6 & 20 Insurance technical reserve: this is calculated based on actuarial assumptions by the insurance 
companies’ appointed independent actuary and involves significant judgements
Estimate
Note 6 Acquisition of subsidiary: fair value of the consideration transferred (contingent consideration) 
and fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed on acquisition – there is significant 
subjectivity in the determination of the fair value of the asset, if any, that should be recognised 
in relation to any life assurance book purchased as well as the fair value of any client portfolio 
asset recognised and any insurance technical reserves
Judgement
Note 13 Measurement of goodwill: the underlying assumptions used, and other critical judgemental 
considerations including the allocation of cash-generating units, in determining whether goodwill 
has been impaired at each annual impairment review
Judgement
Note 23 Provisions: judgement applied in determining the conditions surrounding the debtors to determine 
whether there is objective evidence of impairment
Judgement
e. Basis of measurement
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis, except where investments and other 
financial instruments are held at fair value.
f. Employee benefit trusts
The Company contributes to an employee benefit trust. It is deemed that this trust is controlled by the Company and is therefore 
included within the consolidated financial statements of the Group.
For the year from 1 January 2017 
to 31 December 2017
NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2017 31
3. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
The accounting policies set out below have been applied consistently to all periods presented in these consolidated 
financial statements.
a. Basis of consolidation
i. Subsidiaries
Subsidiaries are entities controlled by the Group. The Group controls an entity when it is exposed to, or has rights to, variable 
returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity. The 
financial statements of subsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date on which control 
commences until the date on which control ceases.
ii. Business combinations
Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method. The consideration transferred in the acquisition is 
measured at fair value, as are the identifiable net assets acquired. Any goodwill that arises is tested annually for impairment. 
Transaction costs are expensed as incurred, except if related to the issue of debt. Any contingent consideration is measured at 
fair value at the date of acquisition and remeasured at each reporting date. Subsequent changes to the contingent consideration 
are adjusted against goodwill. 
iii. Transactions eliminated on consolidation
Intra-group balances and transactions, and any unrealised income and expenses arising from intra-group transactions, are 
eliminated in preparing the consolidated financial statements.
b. Foreign currency
i. Foreign currency transactions
Transactions in foreign currencies are translated to the functional currency of the Group at the exchange rate at the date of 
the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the reporting date are retranslated at the 
exchange rate at that date. The resulting gain or loss is recognised in the statement of comprehensive income. Non-monetary 
assets and liabilities are translated at the exchange rate at the date of the transaction. 
ii. Foreign operations
The assets and liabilities of foreign operations, including goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on acquisition, are translated 
to Pound Sterling (£) at exchange rates at the reporting date. 
Foreign exchange gains and losses arising from monetary items that in substance form part of the net investment in its foreign 
operations are recognised in other comprehensive income and are presented within equity in the foreign currency translation reserve.
c. Revenue
Revenue is derived from the provision of services as described in Note 5 and is recognised in the statement of comprehensive 
income in proportion to the stage of completion of the services at the reporting date on an accruals basis.
Revenue derived from pension trustee and administration fees is split between the establishment fee and the management 
fee. In the first year of membership the establishment and management fees are recognised in full at the time of processing 
the application so as to reflect the time effort incurred in accepting the new member and processing their application. In 
subsequent years a proportion of the management fee is reflected as income at the time of invoicing to reflect the timing of 
the work carried out for the member. The other proportion is amortised over the period to the next renewal date. 
d. Accrued income
Accrued income represents billable time spent on the provision of services to clients which has not been invoiced at the reporting 
date. Accrued income is recorded at the staff charge-out rates in force at the reporting date, less any specific provisions against 
the value of accrued income where recovery will not be made in full. In terms of pension business the accrued income is based 
on the number of applications received but for which an invoice has not been raised yet.
e. Property, plant and equipment
i. Recognition and measurement
Items of property and office equipment are measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses. Cost includes 
expenditures that are directly attributable to the acquisition of the asset and bringing it into use.
Gains and losses on disposal of an item of property and office equipment are determined by comparing the proceeds from disposal 
with the carrying amount of property and office equipment, and are recognised net within other income in profit or loss. 
For the year from 1 January 2017 
to 31 December 2017
NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2017 32
e. Property, plant and equipment (continued)
ii. Depreciation
Depreciation is recognised in the statement of comprehensive income on a reducing balance basis over the estimated useful 
lives of each part of an item of property, plant and equipment. Leased assets are depreciated over the shorter of the lease term 
or the estimated useful life. Depreciation commences once assets are in use.
The rates in use are as follows: 
Office equipment   10% - 25% on a reducing balance basis 
Motor vehicles    25% on a reducing balance basis
Leasehold improvements   Over the life of the leases 
Depreciation methods, useful lives and residual values are reassessed at the reporting date.
f. Financial instruments
Financial assets and liabilities are recognised on the Group’s statement of financial position when the Group becomes party 
to the contractual provisions of the instrument. The Group classifies non-derivative financial assets and liabilities into financial 
assets and liabilities held at fair value through profit and loss and loans and receivables.
i. Loans and receivables
Loans and receivables are financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market. Loans 
and receivables comprise trade and other receivables and are recognised at amortised cost. Generally, this results in their 
recognition at nominal value less any allowance for any doubtful debts.
All loans and borrowings are initially recognised at the fair value of the consideration received. After initial recognition, interest 
bearing loans and borrowings are subsequently measured at amortised cost.
ii. Fair value through profit and loss
A financial asset is classified as at fair value through profit or loss if it is classified as held-for-trading or is designated as such 
on initial recognition. Directly attributable transaction costs are recognised in profit or loss as incurred. Financial assets at 
fair value through profit or loss are measured at fair value and changes therein, including any interest or dividend income, 
are recognised in profit or loss.
iii. Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents in the statement of financial position comprise cash at banks and in hand with an original maturity 
of three months or less.
iv. Share capital
Ordinary shares are classified as equity. Costs directly attributable to the issue of the shares are recognised as a deduction from 
share premium.
Treasury shares are those shares purchased by the STM Group Employee Benefit Trust (EBT) for distribution to executives and 
senior management within the Group, which have yet to be allotted to specific employees. The consideration paid, including 
any attributable incremental costs (net of income taxes), is deducted from the reserves attributable to the Group’s equity holders 
until the shares are cancelled or reissued via the Treasury Reserve.
g. Operating leases
Payments under operating leases are charged directly to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. 
Lease incentives received are recognised as an integral part of the total lease expensed over the term of the lease.
h. Finance leases 
Assets held under finance leases are capitalised at their initial cost. Rentals are set against accounts payable on the straight-
line basis.
i. Employee benefits
The Group operates a defined contribution pension plan. Obligations for contributions to defined contribution pension plans 
are recognised as an expense in the income statement when they are due.
3. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)
For the year from 1 January 2017 
to 31 December 2017
NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2017 33
j. Finance income and expenses
Finance income comprises interest income on funds invested and dividend income. Interest income is recognised as it accrues 
using the effective interest method.
Finance expense comprises interest on borrowings. Interest expense is charged to the income statement using the effective 
interest method.
k. Income tax expense
Income tax expense comprises current and deferred tax. Income tax expense is recognised in the income statement.
Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year using enacted tax rates, updated for previous period 
adjustments.
Deferred tax is recognised using the balance sheet method, providing for temporary differences between carrying amounts of 
assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and for tax purposes. Deferred tax is not provided in respect of goodwill. 
Deferred tax is measured at the tax rates expected to be enacted when they reverse.
l. Intangible assets 
i. Goodwill
Goodwill that arises on the acquisitions of subsidiaries is included in intangible assets. Goodwill represents the excess of the 
cost of the acquisition over the Group’s interest in the net fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities of the acquiree. 
Goodwill is measured at cost less accumulated impairment losses. An annual impairment review is undertaken.
ii. Product development
Product development relates to internal development expenditure incurred in the development of the Group’s new products. 
When these costs meet the recognition criteria of IAS 38 ‘Intangible Assets’ they are capitalised and amortised on a straight-
line basis over a three year period from product launch. 
iii. Client portfolio
Client portfolio acquired in a business combination is carried at cost less accumulated amortisation and any accumulated 
impairment losses. This is amortised on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life. In the case of London & Colonial 
Holdings Ltd and the BUPA portfolio this has been assessed at ten years.
m. Impairment
A financial asset not carried at fair value through profit or loss is assessed at each reporting date to determine whether there 
is objective evidence that it is impaired. A financial asset is considered to be impaired if objective evidence indicates that one 
or more events have had a negative effect on the estimated future cash flows of that asset.
An impairment loss in respect of a financial asset measured at amortised cost is calculated as the difference between its carrying 
amount and the present value of the estimated future cash flows discounted at the original effective interest rate. Losses are 
recognised in the statement of comprehensive income.
Significant financial assets are tested for impairment on an individual basis. The remaining financial assets are assessed collectively 
in groups that share similar credit risk characteristics.
Any impairment losses would be recognised in the statement of comprehensive income.
An impairment loss is reversed if the reversal can be related objectively to an event occurring after the impairment loss was 
recognised. 
The decrease in impairment loss is reversed through the statement of comprehensive income.
The carrying amounts of the Group’s non-financial assets are reviewed at each reporting date to determine whether there is 
any indication of impairment. If any such indication exists then the asset’s recoverable amount is estimated. For goodwill which 
has an indefinite life, the recoverable amount is estimated at each reporting date.
An impairment loss is recognised if the carrying amount of an asset or its cash-generating unit exceeds its recoverable amount. 
A cash-generating unit is the smallest identifiable asset group that generates cash flows that largely are independent from other 
assets and groups. Impairment losses are recognised in the income statement. 
Impairment losses recognised in respect of cash-generating units are allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill 
allocated to the units and then to reduce the carrying amount of the other assets in the unit (group of units) on a pro-rata basis.
3. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)
For the year from 1 January 2017 
to 31 December 2017
NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2017 34
n. Earnings per share
The Group presents basic and diluted earnings per share (EPS) data for its ordinary shares. Basic EPS is calculated by dividing 
the profit or loss attributable to ordinary shareholders of the Company by the weighted average number of ordinary shares 
outstanding during the period. Diluted EPS is determined by adjusting the profit or loss attributable to ordinary shareholders 
and the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding for the effects of all dilutive potential ordinary shares, which 
comprise the effect of outstanding options. The effects of potential ordinary shares are reflected in diluted EPS only when their 
inclusion in the calculation would decrease EPS or increase the loss per share.
o. Deferred income
Deferred income relates to the element of fixed fee income that has been billed in advance which has not been earned as at 
the year end and is released over the period to which it relates.
p. Borrowing costs
Borrowings are recognised initially at fair value net of transaction costs incurred. Borrowings are subsequently stated at amortised 
cost; any difference between proceeds net of transactions costs and the redemption value is recognised in the income statement 
over the period of the borrowing using the effective interest method.
q. Provisions
Provisions are recognised when there is a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event, for which it is 
probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation, and where a reliable estimate can be 
made of the amount of the obligation. The amount of the provision is based on a best estimate of the expenditure required 
to settle the obligation. 
r. New standards and interpretations 
The following new standards and interpretations (as endorsed by the European Union - EU) are mandatory for the first time 
this year. However, following consideration and review they are believed to either not be relevant to the Group or do not have 
a significant impact on the Group’s financial statements apart from additional disclosures: 
• IAS 7  (amended) Disclosure Initiative
• IAS 12 (amended) Recognition of Deferred Tax Assets for Unrealised Losses
• Annual Improvements to IFRSs 2014-2016 Cycle - various standards
In addition a number of new standards, amendments to standards and interpretations are not yet effective for the year ended 
31 December 2017, and have not been applied in preparing these consolidated financial statements. 
IFRS 15 replaces existing revenue recognition guidance, including IAS 18 Revenue and establishes a comprehensive framework 
for determining whether, how much and when revenue is recognised. As such it could change how and when revenue from 
contracts with customers is recognised. With regards to the sale of goods IFRS 15 requires revenue to be recognised when 
a customer obtains control of the goods. With regards to the provision of services revenue is to be recognised either at the 
point of time or over a period of time based on when the service is transferred to the customer. STM has a combination of 
products and services that it offers and therefore some revenue will be at a point of time such as establishment fees for trusts 
and companies, and over time such as the provision of trustee services. The standard is effective for annual periods beginning 
on or after 1 January 2018.
IFRS 9 Financial Instruments sets our requirements for recognising and measuring financial assets, financial liabilities and some 
contracts to buy or sell non-financial items. This standard replaces IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement. 
The standard is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018.
Amendments to IFRS 2: Classification and Measurement of Shared-based Payment Transactions. The standard is effective for 
annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018.
IFRS 16 replaces existing leases guidance, including IAS 17 Leases, IFRIC 4 Determining whether an Arrangement contains a 
Lease, SIC-15 Operating Leases - Incentives and SIC-27 Evaluating the Substance of Transactions Involving the Legal Form of a 
Lease. The standard is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2019.
At the time of signing the financial statements the Group was still assessing the impact of these standards on the consolidated 
financial statements and as such the extent of the impact has not yet been fully determined.

3. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)
s. Disputes and potential legal matters
The Group may at times be involved in disputes arising in the ordinary course of business. In accordance with applicable 
accounting requirements, the Group provides for potential losses that may arise out of these disputes when the potential 
losses are probable and estimable. Disputes in respect of legal matters are subject to many uncertainties and the outcome of 
individual matters cannot be predicted with certainty. The amount of any such provision is based on a best estimate of the 
expenditure required to settle this. 
t. Dividend
Dividends are recognised in the accounting period in which they are authorised and paid. The interim dividend is recognised 
when it is paid and the finial dividend is recognised when it has been approved by shareholders at the Annual General Meeting. 
u. Share based payments
The grant-date fair value of equity settled share payment arrangements granted to employees is recognised as an expense, with 
a corresponding increase in equity, over the vesting period of the awards. Where awards have a market based performance 
condition attached the accounting charge reflects the expected achievement against targets and there is no true-up for 
differences between expected and actual outcomes (Note 18).
v. Insurance products
The life assurance business account for insurance products as investment contracts as no significant insurance risk is attached 
to these contracts. The assets and liabilities of the contracts are included in the Group’s balance sheet only if it is deemed that 
control exists over the investment decision (Note 8).
4. DETERMINATION OF FAIR VALUES
A number of the Group’s accounting policies and disclosures require the determination of fair value, for both financial and 
non-financial assets and liabilities. Fair values have been determined for measurement and/or disclosure purposes based on the 
following methods. When applicable, further information about the assumptions made in determining fair values is disclosed 
in the Notes specific to that asset or liability.
a. Intangible assets - goodwill
The fair value of goodwill acquired in a business combination is based on the excess of the fair value of the consideration over 
the fair value of the underlying assets and liabilities acquired less any impairment considered necessary.
b. Property, plant and equipment
The fair value of property, plant and equipment recognised as a result of a business combination is based on carrying values 
which approximates its fair value at acquisition date. The carrying value of property, plant and equipment is measured at cost 
less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses.
c. Long term business reserve
The long term business provisions included in the Group accounts relate to the insurance companies and are determined by the 
appointed actuary. This reserve is calculated using assumptions based on factors considered by the actuary and the management 
believe this is approximate to the fair value.
d. Investments
The financial instruments held are not traded in an active market and therefore the fair value is established by the Directors using 
valuation techniques which seek to arrive at the price at which an orderly transaction would take place between market participants.

5. SEGMENTAL INFORMATION 
STM Group has four reportable segments: Corporate Trustee Services, Pensions, Life Assurance, and Other Services. Each 
segment is defined as a set of business activities generating a revenue stream and offering different services to other operating 
segments. The Group’s operating segments have been determined based on the management information reviewed by the 
CEO and Board of Directors.
The Board assesses the performance of the operating segments based on turnover generated. The performance of the operating 
segments is not measured using costs incurred as the costs of certain segments within the Group are predominantly centrally 
controlled and therefore the allocation of these is based on utilisation of arbitrary proportions. Management believe that this 
information and consequently profitability could potentially be misleading and would not enhance the disclosure above.
The following table presents the turnover information regarding the Group’s operating segments:

6. ACQUISITION OF SUBSIDIARY
On 21 October 2016, the Company acquired 100% of the ordinary shares and voting interests in London & Colonial Holdings 
Limited (LCH). 
LCH is a service-led independent financial services group with its head office in Haywards Heath, UK, offering SIPP products 
in the United Kingdom; Qualifying Recognised Overseas Pension Schemes (QROPS) in Gibraltar and a life assurance business in 
Gibraltar. The acquisition was highly complementary to STM’s existing business and strategy and contributed to the growth of 
STM. It provided critical mass for STM’s life assurance business as well as establishing STM in the UK SIPP market, the successful 
realisation of an important strategic objective of the Company. It also benefited from cost synergies, economies of scale and 
a good quality management team that has been retained by the Company. All of these factors contributed to the goodwill 
recognised.
The acquisition was accounted for using the acquisition method. 
Consideration for the acquisition on completion date consisted of the following payments:
£000
Initial cash payment 4,135
Second cash payment 100
Contingent consideration 1,150
Total 5,385
The contingent consideration was payable within the first year following acquisition and was dependent on certain regulatory 
capital requirements being met and standard indemnities provided by the Sellers. The Group estimated the fair value of this to 
be the maximum amount payable, being £1,150,000 on acquisition. 
In October 2017, the Group assessed the contingent consideration, and made a cash payment of £800,000 thus reducing the 
initial contingent liability by £350,000. The goodwill on acquisition has been remeasured and adjusted to reflect the fair value 
of the contingent consideration.
Goodwill arising from the acquisition has been remeasured as follows:

8. LIFE ASSURANCE OPERATING SEGMENT
These consolidated financial statements include the results for STM Life Assurance PCC Plc and London & Colonial Assurance 
Plc, two 100% owned subsidiaries whose principal activities are that of the provision of life assurance services. The Companies 
have a licence under the Financial Services (Insurance Companies) Act by the Gibraltar Financial Services Commission to carry 
on linked long term insurance business. 
For the purposes of these consolidated financial statements, only the shareholders’ funds and surplus that emerges on the 
long term fund have been included. The assets invested by the life assurance clients are determined by either the client or 
their advisor and are segregated from the assets and liabilities of other clients. Therefore the Group considers that it does not 
control the investment decision nor accepts any financial risk in respect of that decision and, therefore, the investment assets 
and associated liability to the customer should not be presented on the balance sheet.
Within total revenue of the Group of £21,525,000 (2016: £17,433,000) there is an amount of £5,851,000 (2016: £2,806,000) 
relating to revenues attributable to the life assurance businesses. The financial performance and balance on the long term fund

Impairment testing for cash-generating units containing goodwill
All goodwill relates to the acquisitions made during the period from 28 March 2007 to 31 December 2017, and reflects the 
difference between the identifiable net asset value of those acquisitions and the total consideration incurred for those acquisitions.
Goodwill arising on acquisition is allocated to the cash-generating units comprising the acquired businesses. Given the level of 
integration and synergies these units comprise the jurisdictions in which businesses have been acquired as follows:

Spain
£000

Reclassification — (422) — (422)
At 31 December 2017 15,465 48 977 16,490
The Group tests goodwill annually for impairment with the recoverable amount being determined from value in use calculations 
which are based on Board approved projections. A pre-tax discount rate of 13% has been used in discounting the projected cash 
flows. The assumptions applied for turnover growth range between -4% and 4% for the various CGUs and have been arrived at 
using past experience and knowledge of the various markets and internal strategies for each CGU. Similarly for expenses a growth 
rate of between 0% and 3% has been applied. 
The valuations indicate sufficient headroom such that a reasonable potential change to key assumptions is unlikely to result in an 
impairment of the related goodwill. 
Based on the operating performance of the respective CGUs, no impairment loss was deemed necessary in the current financial year.

(2016: 59,408,087) and 62,378,491 dilutive (2016: 61,250,387) in issue.
A reconciliation of the basic and diluted number of shares used in the year ended 31 December 2017 is:

Diluted 62,378,491 61,250,387
18. SHARE BASED PAYMENTS
On 18 May 2016, the Company adopted the Value Creation Plan (VCP) which provides long term incentives for the Executive 
Directors and senior management as appropriate. 
The VCP pays out based on 8.35% of the total value created for shareholders over the Performance Period in excess of the 
threshold share price of 60p. This excess is measured as the difference between the 30 day average closing share price of the 
Company following the announcement of the 2018 financial results plus the value of any dividends paid during the Performance 
Period and the threshold price. The Performance Period started on 10 March 2015 and ends one month after the Company 
announces its 2018 financial results.
Under IFRS 2, the fair value of any award needs to be determined at grant date and spread proportionally across the vesting 
period. The vesting date is the period from the date of grant (18 May 2016, when the VCP was approved by the shareholders at 
the Annual General Meeting) and the end of the Performance Period. Given the VCP has a market based performance condition 
attached, namely the share price threshold, the accounting charge reflects the expected achievement against targets. A Monte 
Carlo valuation was carried out to calculate this fair value using a share price volatility of 19%, risk free rate of interest of 1% 
and the share price at the grant date of 46p.
The charge for the year which has been recognised within the share based payment reserve is £55,000 (2016: £34,000).

22. FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT
The Group has exposure to the following risks from its use of financial instruments:
• Credit risk
• Liquidity risk
• Market risk
• Interest rate risk
• Currency risk
• Regulatory risk
This Note presents information about the Group’s exposure to each of the above risks, the Group’s objectives, policies and 
processes for measuring and managing risk, and the Group’s management of capital. Further quantitative disclosures are 
included throughout these consolidated financial statements.
The Board of Directors has overall responsibility for the establishment and oversight of the Group’s risk management framework. The 
Board has an Audit & Risk Committee, which is responsible for developing and monitoring the Group’s risk management policies. 
The Group’s risk management policies are established to identify and analyse the risks faced by the Group, to set appropriate risk 
limits and controls, and to monitor risks and adherence to limits. Risk management policies and systems are reviewed regularly 
to reflect changes in market condition and the Group’s activities. The Group, through its training and management standards 
and procedures, aims to develop a disciplined and constructive control environment in which all employees understand their 
roles and obligations.
a. Credit risk
Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its 
contractual obligations, and arises principally from the Group’s receivables from clients.
Trade and other receivables
The Group’s exposure to credit risk is influenced mainly by the individual characteristics of each client. The demographics of 
the Group’s client base, including the default risk of the country in which the clients operate, has less of an influence on credit 
risk. There is no one client to which a significant percentage of the Group’s revenue can be attributed.
The Group establishes a provision for impairment that represents its estimate of incurred losses in respect of trade and other 
receivables.
b. Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due. The Group’s approach 
to managing liquidity is to ensure, as far as possible, that it will always have sufficient liquidity to meet its liabilities when due, 
under both normal and stressed conditions. 
c. Market risk
Market risk is the risk that changes in market prices, such as foreign exchange rates, interest rates and equity prices will affect 
the Group’s income or the value of its holdings of financial instruments. The object of market risk management is to manage and 
control market risk expenses within acceptable parameters, while optimising the return. The Group does not have a significant 
exposure to market risk.
d. Interest rate risk
The Company only has one bank borrowing at the year end. A change of 100 basis points in an interest rate would have 
increased or decreased equity and profit or loss by £33,000 after tax (2016: £33,000).
e. Currency risk
The Group has a small exposure to currency risk in relation to the investment in STM Nummos. This is mitigated by the fact 
that the assets and liabilities held by STM Nummos are in its functional currency of Euros (€). It has a further currency risk in 
relation to the expenses incurred in Malta as these are in Euros (€). This is mitigated by the fact that clients are invoiced in its 
and the Group’s functional currency of Pound Sterling (£).
The Company has minimised exposure to foreign exchange rates, with the majority of transactions being carried out in its 
functional currency of Pound Sterling (£).
For the year from 1 January 2017 
to 31 December 2017
NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2017 48
f. Regulatory risk
The Group is subject to laws, regulations and specific solvency requirements in the various jurisdictions in which it operates. 
The Group has established policies and procedures aimed at compliance with local laws and regulations.
g. Capital management
The Board’s policy is to maintain a strong capital base, which is defined as share capital and retained earnings, so as to maintain 
investor, creditor and market confidence and to sustain future development of the business. 
Furthermore, some of the Company’s subsidiaries are licensed by the respective jurisdictions’ regulators and as such all comply 
with the regulatory capital requirements set by each respective regulatory body.
The Group manages its capital to ensure that the entities in the Group will be able to continue as a going concern, while 
maximising the return to stakeholders through optimisation of the debt and equity balance. The capital structure of the Group 
consists of debt, which includes a bank loan as per Note 21, and equity attributable to shareholders, comprising reserves and 
retained earnings as disclosed. The Board reviews the capital structure and, as part of this review, considers the cost of capital 
and the risks associated with each class of capital. In addition the Board of Directors considers the liquidity and solvency of the 
Group on an ongoing basis.
The Group monitors capital using a ratio of ‘adjusted net debt’ to ‘adjusted equity’. For this purpose, adjusted net debt is 
defined as total liabilities, comprising interest-bearing loans and borrowings less cash and cash equivalents. Adjusted equity 
comprises all components of equity.
The Group’s adjusted net debt to equity ratio at 31 December 2017 was negative. Net debt compared to equity at 31 December 
2017 was as follows:
31 December 2017 
£000
31 December 2016
£000
Total liabilities 13,475 15,078
Less: cash and cash equivalents 18,363 11,869
Adjusted net debt (4,888) 3,209
Total equity and adjusted equity 30,772 27,662
Adjusted net debt to adjusted equity ratio (0.16) 0.12
23. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
Credit Risk
Exposure to credit risk

Investments 81 5,031
Trade and other receivables 5,607 5,193
Cash and cash equivalents 18,363 11,869
Total 24,051 22,093
The Group’s maximum exposure to credit risk on trade and other receivables relating to one entity or group of related entities 
amounts to less than 10% of the overall trade receivable amount as at 31 December 2017 and 31 December 2016.

23. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS (continued)
Impairment losses on trade receivables
Impairment on trade receivables is determined by assessing the conditions of the debtors to determine whether there is objective 
evidence of impairment. Objective evidence that trade receivables are impaired include:
- Default or delinquency by a debtor;
- Indications that a debtor will enter bankruptcy;
- Adverse changes in the payment status of the debtor;
- Observable data indicating that there is a measurable decrease in the expected cash flows from a debtor.
The ageing of the Group’s trade receivables at the reporting date was:

Total 3,728 (294) 3,434 4,136 (739) 3,397
Standard credit terms are 30 days from the date of issuing the fee note.
The movement in the allowance for impairment in respect of trade receivables during the period was:
31 December 2017 
£000
31 December 2016
£000
Balance at start of year 739 699
Impairment loss (released)/increased 6 40
Amounts written off (451) —
Balance at end of year 294 739
Based on historic default rates, the Group believes that no impairment allowance is necessary in respect of some of the trade 
receivables older than a year and those that are not more than one year old. This is because, invariably, the Group are administering 
clients’ assets and therefore have further recourses for the recoverability of any debts outstanding.
Liquidity Risk
The Group holds sufficient liquid assets, including cash at bank, to enable it to meet its liabilities as they fall due. The following 
are the Group’s contractual maturity liabilities. The amounts are gross and undiscounted, and include contractual interest 
payments and exclude the impact of netting arrangements.
