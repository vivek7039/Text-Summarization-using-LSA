Group snapshot
The world of energy is changing and, 
with our chosen businesses, distinctive 
propositions and current capabilities, 
Centrica is well placed to deliver for its 
customers, shareholders and for society. 
We aim to be a good corporate citizen 
and an employer of choice. 
Our areas of focus for growth are Energy 
Supply, Services, Connected Home, 
Distributed Energy & Power, Energy 
Marketing & Trading. We also have a 
material Exploration & Production division.
We supply energy and services to over 25 
million customer accounts mainly in the UK, 
Ireland and North America through strong 
brands such as British Gas, Direct Energy 
and Bord Gáis Energy, all supported by 
around 15,000 engineers and technicians. 
We are focused on delivering high levels of 
customer service, engagement and loyalty.
Technology is increasingly important in 
the delivery of energy and services to our 
customers. We are developing innovative 
products, offers and solutions, underpinned 
by investment in technology. In 2017 we 
announced the creation of a new venture 
‘Centrica Innovations’ to identify, incubate 
and accelerate new technologies and 
innovations.
At the end of 2017 , phase one of Centrica’s 
repositioning was complete. We have 
simplified our business and portfolio. 
We now have just three divisions – 
Centrica Consumer, Centrica Business 
and Exploration & Production. Our asset 
portfolio has been materially repositioned.
We delivered our £750 million per annum 
cost efficiency programme three years early 
and met our net debt targets. We are seeing 
encouraging signs of progress in our 
customer-facing businesses. In our next 
phase to 2020, we will further shift 
investment towards those businesses and 
focus on performance delivery, specifically 
growing gross margin and driving a further 
£500 million per annum of cost efficiencies, 
while maintaining financial discipline.

Centrica plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 | 3 We are in the midst of a necessarily 
ambitious transition: from a diversified 
company, back to its core; to a customer-
focused provider of value-added services 
and solutions; to a digital partner, providing 
data-led insights into the whole energy 
experience of our customers; to an offering 
that provides products, expertise and 
guidance, not simply molecules and 
electrons; to a business model in which we 
can control our own destiny to a far greater 
degree than in the past.
This would be a tough undertaking even in a 
benign and supportive political environment. 
As it is, the pressures we have faced from 
this quarter in our important home market 
have raised the degree of competitive 
difficulty and created an air of uncertainty 
that weighed heavily on our share price 
in 2017 . I am disappointed that the many 
actions we have taken to help vulnerable 
customers, bring old tariff models to an 
end and reward loyalty have received little 
recognition from politicians. 
Our response has been to strive to make 
Centrica more resilient to our external 
environment. This requires a fundamental 
repositioning of our organisation, processes 
and systems, integrating a hitherto 
fragmented structure, always in the service 
of our customers. This must all necessarily 
be executed at pace, because to stand 
still in our fast-moving sector is to invite 
obsolescence, and because our employees 
understandably want to get to the other side 
as quickly as possible. There is a palpable 
desire within Centrica to find new ways of 
accelerating cultural change, building 
innovative capabilities and better meeting 
our customers’ expectations at a lower cost.
Accordingly, the business is being rebuilt 
on a firm foundation. Underlying everything, 
and essential to long-term value creation, 
has been the considerable work done by 
Iain Conn and his senior leadership team in 
focusing on our core businesses of energy 
supply and services, and the propositions 
which our customers expect today and 
desire tomorrow. 
All the while ensuring that the fundamentals 
of change – our purpose, our new values and 
new ethical standards – are fresh, relevant 
and deep rooted, with safety, compliance 
and conduct at the top of our agenda.
The strategic transition is being delivered well 
and all of our declared financial targets have 
been met. But there have also been areas of 
weakness, particularly in our North American 
power book during the second half of the 
year. The impact of competitive and pricing 
pressures here was exacerbated by a 
seasonally weak performance from our 
North American gas business and the 
discovery of an historical accounting issue. 
Our control systems are being enhanced 
and improved and the accounting issue 
was verified as having been a one-off. 
But not before deep damage had been 
done to confidence in the Company and 
its prospects, with commensurate harm to 
our share price layered on top of the impacts 
of the current political uncertainty. There 
was an understandably strong reaction 
from investors and doubts emerged 
about the detail and deliverability of the 
Centrica strategy.
I hope that our Executive team went a long 
way to addressing these concerns at the 
Preliminary Results in February. They 
reminded our stakeholders that the first 
phase of our strategic repositioning has been 
successfully completed. They reinforced the 
point that our Consumer division remains 
stable and profitable, with the prospect of 
real growth, and that there is further scope 
for cost efficiency gains. 
They offered explanations, not excuses, 
for the performance issues in our Business 
division. Above all, they sought to reassure 
investors that, through our changing 
portfolio, cost efficiency and divestment 
options, Centrica has a strengthening 
resilience to uncertainty.
As ever, we recognise that the good 
governance of the Company is essential to 
the delivery of our strategy. So, in that spirit, 
let me offer a window into the business of 
your Board in 2017: the issues which will 
dominate our agendas in the coming year 
and our plans to build further on the new 
governance approaches to risk mapping, 
stakeholder engagement and board 
development that we have implemented 
in recent years.
The first and key question we revisit at each 
meeting, and in the round each October, is 
whether we are pursuing the right strategy. 
It can be tempting to alter course in the face 
of strong headwinds. And this has been the 
subject of renewed challenge by your Board 
since our trading update in November.
Our strong and shared contention is that 
strategy is not about short-term adjustments; 
it is about staying true to our purpose and 
aligning ourselves with the fundamental 
forces – consumer power and choice, 
decentralisation and digitisation in particular 
– that are changing the energy world, 
affecting both our customers and the planet. 
So, we believe the answer to be clear. 
Nothing has happened to invalidate the 
strategy which we set out in 2015.
2017 was a difficult year for Centrica and,  
to my deep regret, for our shareholders.
Chairman’s Statement
Our vision is clear,  
our determination is 
unshakeable, our 
governance is robust 
and we are confident 
that we will return 
Centrica to real and 
sustainable growth.
Rick Haythornthwaite 
Chairman
4 | Centrica plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Strategic Report | Chairman’s Statement In 2018, our focus is very much on strategy 
delivery and performance management. 
We are concentrating on those things which 
we can control and we are prioritising the 
performance of our existing businesses over 
expansion. We are confident that the shape 
of the business we now have is the right one 
to deliver growth over time and achieve our 
strategic goals. 
Meanwhile, we have continued to revise and 
refresh our approach to risk management to 
ensure that we have a stronger framework in 
place as we pursue our strategic objectives. 
In 2017 , we focused on embedding our 
redesigned process. The risk management 
framework makes a positive contribution to 
good decision-making and business growth 
and will be even stronger for the lessons 
learnt last year. Your Board discussed all 
aspects of our perceived risk exposure, 
with particular emphasis on process safety, 
political pressures, strategic delivery, cyber-
security, capability development and 
leadership succession. 
Inextricably linked to leadership succession 
is our approach to the attraction and 
retention of key people, a component of 
which relates to their remuneration. This year 
we are putting a new Remuneration Policy to 
the vote at our Annual General Meeting and 
have sought, through extensive dialogue, 
to understand and reflect the evolving 
consensus of the body of our investor base. 
We recognise in our recommended Policy 
an increasing investor discomfort with 
reward for input if and when performance 
outcomes are lagging.
So, we are proposing that annual bonuses 
should be more closely tied to shareholder 
experience, regardless of the quality and 
intensity of the Executive team efforts. Longer-
term reward remains very much aligned to the 
fortunes of shareholders, with deferred stock-
based schemes ensuring that only sustained 
performance and growth is rewarded. But to 
strengthen this link further, we are proposing 
to add a Total Shareholder Return measure 
to the Long Term Incentive Plan. More details 
are set out in the revised Remuneration Policy 
on pages 90 to 97 of this report.
Throughout 2017 , our Executive team 
worked tirelessly to deliver the first phase of 
the strategic transformation and, in the eyes 
of your Board, exceeded our expectations 
in their ability to close difficult divestments, 
navigate complex changes in the 
organisation in a very sensitive manner and 
bring home promised efficiency gains three 
years ahead of schedule. But that good 
strategic work was overshadowed by the 
disappointed expectations of short-term 
performance and the impact of UK 
government pressure, with the net result of 
a significant fall in the value of your Company.
Our current Remuneration Policy would 
have resulted in significant annual bonuses, 
though considerably less than last year, even 
after adjustment for the effects of weather 
and commodity prices. The impact of the 
painful shareholder experience of 2017 
would have had little impact on the 
calculated outcome. The newly proposed 
Remuneration Policy goes some way to 
redressing this mismatch. But, pending its 
adoption, your Board decided that discretion 
should be exercised under the current policy 
to reflect recent events, even though a 
significant portion of the impact was beyond 
the control of the Executive team.
Accordingly, no annual bonuses or pay 
rises were awarded to the Executive 
Directors for 2017 and, provided the new 
Remuneration Policy is adopted, stock awards 
under the forthcoming Long Term Incentive 
Plan will be reduced. This reinforces the 
broad and collective accountability of the 
Executive leadership.
In other matters, your Board spent much 
time over the past year ensuring that the 
business has the right teams in place with 
the right leadership style to achieve our 
strategic objectives. The future of our 
Company depends on having the best 
talent and on the motivation of that talent. 
Once again, our people have surpassed 
my expectations and I would like to thank 
them for all their hard work.
But we, as the leaders of this business, 
must do more to support our own people. 
Employee engagement levels fell again in 
2017 as the transition process continued. 
Our Gender Pay Statement showed that 
women at Centrica are paid on average 12% 
less than men, although we have a strong 
track record of equal pay for equal work. 
This gap can be explained in part by the 
legacy of traditionally male-dominated field 
engineering roles in our business. But it must 
be closed and we are committed to doing so.
So, I have asked our Non-Executive Director, 
Joan Gillman, to undertake a review of key 
employee matters and how we might assure 
ourselves that the voice of our people is 
being heard loud and clear in the boardroom. 
Joan has wide-ranging experience in the 
media and communications sector, with 
a very evident empathy towards the 
importance of engagement, teamwork and 
diversity. Her review will allow her to bring 
more Centrica-specific content to her 
boardroom contributions and challenge.
We bade farewell to Lesley Knox who 
stepped down after six years of much 
appreciated service as a Non-Executive 
Director, for which she has our sincere 
gratitude. We are in the process of seeking 
a successor who will bring, not only digital 
insights into customer segmentation and 
journeys, but also the voice of the customer 
into the boardroom, ensuring that we avoid 
circularity and insularity of thinking.
To that end, we in particular need to focus 
more on our weakest performance if we are 
truly to improve customer experience levels 
and open up the powerful possibility of our 
customers becoming our advocates. This 
is the most reliable route to dealing with the 
trust gap that confronts business as a whole 
and the energy supply sector in particular. 
As Board members, we all have personal 
experience of handling complaints from 
customers who contact us directly. We 
cannot help but be affected by what we 
sometimes hear. But the flow is still too 
anecdotal to be helpful in holding the 
Executive team to account on its drive to 
improve service. So, once recruited, I will be 
asking our new Non-Executive Director to 
consider how best to keep our boardroom 
dialogues deeply connected to our 
customers, their needs and our responses.
In summary, what we are trying to achieve 
at Centrica is not easy. In fact, it is one of the 
most ambitious changes attempted by any 
company in one of the most competitive and 
challenging sectors of the economy. But we 
are not doing this out of ambition. We are 
doing this because it is absolutely necessary 
for the future of this business that we adapt 
to the changes in the energy landscape and 
that we find new ways to meet the changing 
needs of our customers.
We believed this in 2015 when we set out our 
new strategic direction. We believe it now. 
Our future is in the hands of our customers 
and, by extension, our own hands. We may 
occasionally stumble on the road and be 
jostled by powerful external forces. But 
our vision is clear, our determination is 
unshakeable, our governance is robust 
and we are confident that we will return 
Centrica to real and sustainable growth.

Centrica plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 | 5 2017 was a challenging year for Centrica. 
Our performance in the second half was weak, 
particularly in Business energy supply. 
Group Chief 
Executive’s Statement
This, combined with uncertainty around 
our future prospects in UK energy supply, 
significantly amplified by the Prime Minister’s 
announcement in October that the UK 
Government would pursue a market-wide 
price cap of the Standard Variable Tariff (SVT) 
and other default tariffs, resulted in a 
significant fall in our share price in 2017 , 
particularly over the fourth quarter. 
Some of the drivers were clearly beyond our 
control. But clearly we regret the outcome 
and the impact it has had on our shareholders 
and on our employees. I am determined to 
restore shareholder value and confidence. 
The underlying trends driving our strategy 
are clear, as are the distinctive capabilities 
we have to benefit from them. We are 
committed to delivering attractive returns 
and growth over the medium term. Our focus 
today is on performance delivery and financial 
discipline – on demonstrating top line growth 
as we deliver improved service and new 
propositions for our customers, and driving 
efficiency as hard as possible to underpin 
our competitiveness.
Although we delivered our 2017 published 
targets in terms of operating cash flow, cost 
efficiency and headcount reduction, capital 
discipline and net debt, our financial results 
were disappointing. Adjusted operating profit 
at £1.25 billion was down 17%, earnings 
were down 22%, at £698 million, equivalent 
to 12.6 pence per share. Adjusted operating 
cash flow was £2.07 billion. EBITDA of 
£2.14 billion was down 9%.
We delivered a disappointing result in our 
North America Business operation. This 
was both in terms of the performance of 
our power supply book and from a charge 
relating to historical revenue recognition 
in one of our billing systems going back to 
2013. Performance in UK Business energy 
supply was also poor. Adjusted operating 
profit for Centrica Business as a whole was 
down 67%. 
However, Centrica Consumer delivered 
robust performance with adjusted operating 
profit down only 1% despite the impacts of 
warm weather, the UK Government pre-
payment tariff cap, competitive intensity 
and investing for growth.
Despite the setbacks, the foundations of our 
businesses remain strong. We believe our 
business model is – and will continue to be – 
resilient, even under the pressures we face. 
Our strategy is clear. It is founded on an 
analysis of market trends and sources of 
growth, on our own capabilities and the 
efficiency necessary to pursue them profitably.
Centrica is an energy and services company. 
Our purpose is ‘to provide energy and 
services to satisfy the changing needs of our 
customers’. This is the core of the Company 
and we have been supplying energy and 
services to customers since 1812. We are 
re-emphasising and returning to that core. 
However, it is not 1812, the needs of 
customers are indeed changing, and as 
we deliver for them the propositions we 
offer must change too.
Globally, the energy system is becoming 
more decentralised, customers are 
becoming more powerful because of 
increased choice, and technology is 
accelerating the pace of change. These 
trends, which we identified when we 
launched our new strategy in 2015, are even 
clearer today and are playing out in line with 
our views at the time. We are in step with 
where the energy world is going and the 
services which our customers desire. We 
do not believe that anything has happened 
since 2015 to invalidate our strategy or the 
core strengths of the Company.
As a result, Centrica is focusing more 
investment on the customer-facing 
businesses. We are also becoming simpler 
as an organisation. We now have only three 
divisions, Centrica Consumer, Centrica 
Business and Exploration & Production 
(E&P). Each has a clear participation strategy 
and strategic framework. The reason we have 
established Group-wide Consumer and 
Business divisions is that we have found 
that customer needs are very similar globally, 
and they are seeking more than simply 
energy supply.
Our focus today is on 
performance delivery 
and financial discipline 
– on demonstrating top 
line growth as we deliver 
improved service and 
new propositions for our 
customers and driving 
efficiency as hard as 
possible to underpin 
our competitiveness.
Iain Conn
Group Chief Executive
6 | Centrica plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Strategic Report | Group Chief Executive’s Statement What we are doing is not a radical departure 
from our roots; it is a natural extension 
of who we are and what we are good at. 
Through installing boilers, heating systems 
and their controllers we have always been 
in the ‘home energy management’ business. 
Our development of Hive, starting with the 
digital thermostat and the intelligent boiler, 
is the next phase in the evolution of home 
energy management and a direct extension 
of our in-home services business. 
We are finding that consumers want these 
propositions and are willing to pay for them. 
We are also finding that many customers 
value receiving these services from the same 
provider as their energy supply. The same 
principles apply to our business customers. 
The new propositions and services we have 
developed are not a distraction or somehow 
unrelated to our legacy businesses. They are 
at the heart of what our legacy offerings have 
to incorporate and what the most valuable 
customer segments are demanding.
In our Consumer division, revenues have 
been stable and unit gross margins are 
attractive. We did see a fall of 1.35 million 
customer accounts during 2017 . We have 
made active choices on which channels 
and customer segments we are seeking 
to engage, retain and serve. We do not like 
losing any customers but most of these 
customer accounts generated very low 
gross margin and were loss-making at the 
operating profit level.
In contrast, while we have seen some losses 
in higher value accounts, in 2017 we were 
successful in encouraging a net approximately 
700,000 UK energy accounts from the 
SVT to our fixed-term tariffs. We have seen 
material growth in new services and 
relationships. We saw 18% growth in 
protection plans in the US. In Connected 
Home we saw cumulative installed hubs 
grow by 71% to 900,000 over 2017 . We 
exceeded our target of 1.5 million products 
sold. Connected Home continues to grow 
in all of our energy supply geographies, and 
our first international partnership with Eni 
gas e luce in Italy will see its full commercial 
launch in April.
Our Local Heroes scheme has grown rapidly 
from its launch at the beginning of last year. 
We now have 7 ,000 tradespeople signed 
up, backed by our guarantee, and we have 
now completed over 25,000 jobs. This on-
demand offer continues to accelerate and it 
complements our own contract relationships 
through British Gas.
We have also seen the number of British Gas 
services accounts deliver the first year of 
stability since 2010. Accounts grew by 
77 ,000 in the second half, reversing the fall 
we saw in the first half. In addition, 700,000 
customers have so far signed up for British 
Gas Rewards, enabling us to enhance 
the relationship and proposition for our 
loyal customers in combination with our 
other offers.
In our customer businesses, our goal is to 
focus on value, not volume, retaining and 
engaging our customers while continuing 
to drive costs down to maintain margins. 
This is what we will concentrate on across 
the Centrica Consumer portfolio as we 
extend the propositions we can offer our 
customers with the goal also to stabilise and 
grow the total number of relationships we 
have. We believe we can continue to make 
progress, even in the face of further price 
regulation in the UK.
As we have made clear, we do not support 
price controls in competitive retail energy 
markets and we believe they will not 
ultimately benefit customers. We believe 
price caps will reduce competition and 
choice, and prices tend to ultimately 
converge around the cap level. Instead, 
to improve the market our focus is on 
increasing customer engagement, driving 
cost efficiency, improving service levels, 
on rewarding loyalty and on delivering 
propositions that customers want.
Last year, we announced a package of 
actions and proposed measures to reform 
the UK energy market for the long term and 
really benefit customers, without the need for 
price controls. At its heart are our decision to 
withdraw the British Gas SVT and our call for 
the UK Government and the regulator to ban 
this sort of rolling tariff across the industry. 
We will introduce new, attractive fixed-term 
propositions including fixed-price, online only 
and bundled tariffs. We will introduce a new 
default tariff and increase choice to try to 
avoid people going onto a default tariff in the 
first place. Allied to a greater range of choice 
for customers and simpler bills, we think 
these measures will be far more effective 
in improving the market for customers than 
any price caps.
However, given the prospect of default tariff 
cap legislation we are taking a number of 
steps to reduce our relative exposure to price 
caps and their impact on Centrica. We will 
reduce our exposure to a cap, using our 
recent efficiency to continue to price 
competitively and to drive further cost 
reductions. We had 4.3 million customers 
on SVTs at the end of 2017 and we expect 
to reduce this to 3 million by the end of this 
year as the measures described above take 
effect. Secondly, as a result of our own cost 
efficiencies and other actions to date, 
our current SVT is cheaper than 85% of 
the market and is £41 a year below the 
average SVT of the large suppliers. Thirdly, 
our efficiency programme will deliver an 
additional estimated saving of £20 per dual 
fuel customer by 2020.
Taking all of this together, and recognising 
that the formula for any potential cap is not 
yet known, we believe that we can deliver 
a sustainable energy supply business in 
the UK with healthy returns under most 
conceivable scenarios.
Turning to Centrica Business, we have 
continued to develop our business across 
the five pillars of our divisional strategic 
framework. We find that in addition to the 
commodity offerings of energy supply and 
energy wholesale, business customers 
want access to more distributed energy 
generation solutions, and we are moving 
from building large central power generation 
plants to many smaller distributed units. 
Our customers want combined heat and 
power units, solar arrays and the grid 
operators want distributed power systems 
and technology to assist with the optimisation 
of local energy markets and micro-grids. 
Along with this, customers want to be able 
to gain insight from their energy use to save 
money and improve their operations, 
including in preventative maintenance. 
Customers who have distributed energy 
assets want to be able to optimise them 
and are willing to pay for optimisation 
services rather than do it themselves.
We have responded to these needs by 
developing capabilities in all of these areas, 
both organically and through targeted 
acquisitions of Panoramic Power, ENER-G 
Cogen, Neas Energy and REstore. We have 
also expanded our distribution and sales 
capability and built a new marketing platform 
for business customers under the brand 
Centrica Business Solutions.
Centrica plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 | 7 We have also disposed of our large gas fired 
generation plants and our two large wind 
farms and continued to shift our portfolio to 
more distributed assets. We have converted 
some sites to peaking plant and have several 
projects underway to build new gas fired 
rapid response generation sites, as well as 
constructing a battery storage facility which 
is one of the largest in Europe. We also aim 
to divest our shareholding in UK nuclear 
power. Subject to ensuring alignment with 
our partner, and being very mindful of UK 
Government interests in this area, we would 
hope to achieve this by the end of 2020.
The business customer is also on the 
move and we are responding to their needs. 
They want more than just commodity 
energy supply, and the new capabilities 
and propositions we have developed once 
again reinforce the core of the relationship. 
The returns in value-added services tend 
to be higher than in pure commodity 
energy supply.
The big message, therefore, whether in 
Centrica Consumer or Centrica Business, 
is that the new propositions and services 
we have developed are at the heart of what 
Centrica’s core offerings in energy and 
services now have to incorporate. They are 
at the heart of what important and valuable 
customer segments are demanding. 
Centrica has now developed the capabilities 
to offer them in a high-quality way. We are 
seeing improvements in the customer 
experience and the growth in demand 
is feeding through to revenues and at 
attractive margins.
Since we embarked on our new strategic 
direction we have made a number of 
acquisitions to provide the key capabilities 
we did not already have in-house. These 
acquisitions have all met, and in some 
cases exceeded, our expectations. We have 
widened the footprint of the Group beyond 
the UK and North America to serve 
customers in 40 countries. However, in the 
last three months of 2017 the risk envelope 
for Centrica changed, and as a result, we will 
not be pursuing growth through major M&A 
activities. This is because the uncertainty 
over the UK price cap is too great and we 
wish to maintain our hard-fought balance 
sheet strength. We will, however, continue 
to pursue smaller bolt-on acquisitions to 
build capability in key areas.
In our asset businesses we have made 
divestments of over £900 million – towards 
the top of our target range – and reduced 
capital investment into them. Last year, 
we combined our E&P operations with 
Bayerngas Norge AS, and the new business, 
Spirit Energy – in which we hold a 69% stake 
– began trading as an independent oil and 
gas operator. Our goal is to make Spirit 
Energy stronger and more sustainable and 
we will now target further consolidation. We 
would be open to having a lower ownership 
percentage in a larger entity, provided our net 
E&P exposure remains broadly unchanged 
and we retain sufficient influence to shape 
the strategic direction of the business. We 
would therefore also be prepared to own less 
than 50% of Spirit Energy if the right 
opportunity came along.
We also concluded that our Rough storage 
asset was no longer capable of safe injection 
operations due to its age and condition and 
that, because of the economics of seasonal 
storage and the cost of refurbishing or 
rebuilding the facility, neither pathway would 
be economic. We therefore decided that we 
can no longer operate Rough as a storage 
facility and have now received all relevant 
consents and approvals to extract the 
recoverable gas from the reservoir. In the 
past, Rough has made a vital contribution 
to the nation’s security of supply. But today, 
the UK is fortunate in benefiting from a 
diverse range of energy sources. 
Centrica is halfway through a six-year strategic 
repositioning of the Company and I would 
now like to summarise what has been 
delivered during the first phase since 2015. 
We have continued our reallocation of 
resources away from the asset businesses 
towards our customer-facing activities. We 
have made divestments of over £900 million 
and reduced capital allocation to E&P by 
£300 million per annum while investing an 
additional £700 million across 2016 and 2017 
in the customer-facing businesses. This has 
enhanced our capabilities and technologies, 
leaving us well positioned to capitalise on 
consumer trends.
We have been successful in reducing costs. 
We have delivered our £750 million cost 
efficiency programme three years early. 
We have also set out plans for further 
significant cost reductions, totalling an 
additional £500 million a year by 2020, which 
will release more savings to support our aim 
of becoming the most efficient price setter 
for our chosen propositions and brands.
We have reduced our net debt to less than 
£2.6 billion, in the lower half of our target end 
2017 band, and our credit metrics are at levels 
currently required for the strong investment-
grade credit ratings that we aim for. 
As we look forward to 2018/20, although 
we have still got some portfolio development 
to complete, the focus is on performance 
delivery and financial discipline. In 
performance terms, it is about growing 
gross margin through our customer 
relationships, and driving the next phase 
of cost efficiency. We will also be focusing 
on improving organisational effectiveness 
and securing the capabilities we need in 
2020 and beyond. We must do all of this 
while continuing to deliver improvements 
in safety, compliance and conduct and in 
operational excellence across the Company, 
starting with customer service.

Page 45 We will be targeting delivery, on average, 
of £2.1–£2.3 billion of adjusted operating 
cash flow per annum. We believe this is 
deliverable, even taking into account a 
potential price cap, for the reasons outlined 
earlier. But there remains a risk that a 
particularly severe cap impact in the first 
year may put this target at risk for 2019. 
As we continue to focus on financial 
discipline we will be limiting capex to no 
more than £1.2 billion per annum and 
targeting to maintain net debt within a 
£2.25–£3.25 billion range. Despite current 
pressures, we expect to continue to be able 
to balance sources and uses of cash in 2018, 
without materially affecting our ability to 
invest in the business and deliver on all 
aspects of our financial framework.
In terms of the dividend, we have indicated 
since 2015 that it would be linked to operating 
cash flow and we expect to maintain the 
current level of the dividend over the period 
2018/20, subject to meeting our adjusted 
operating cash flow and net debt targets. 
We believe we can manage within both these 
constraints under most scenarios based on 
our current projections, but clearly, there are 
always risks associated with extremes of 
commodity price movements and regulatory 
interventions. We would intend to restore a 
progressive dividend only when, in addition 
to the criteria already mentioned, underlying 
cash flow growth capability is demonstrated. 
The transformation of Centrica is also about 
the values which guide us as we go about 
our daily business. In 2017 we launched a 
new set of Group-wide values – ‘our Values’ 
of Care, Collaboration, Courage, Delivery 
and Agility – and in January this year we 
launched ‘Our Code’, which replaces the 
Business Principles and other codes of 
conduct within the Group. We wanted 
a clear, unified statement of the most 
important principles and expectations which 
apply to all of us. In essence, ‘our Values’ 
and ‘Our Code’ embody what we stand for. 
We hope that they will help all of us at 
Centrica make the right decisions.
The transition we are making has not been 
easy for our team. Our people have faced, 
and will continue to face, a number of new 
challenges. But they have shown extraordinary 
resilience, passion, commitment and talent, 
and I would like to thank each of them for all 
their contributions over the past year.
The first phase of our strategic repositioning 
is complete. We have strengthened the 
balance sheet, paid down debt, matched 
our sources and uses of cash, and refocused 
resources and capability towards the 
customer. But we are only halfway through 
a six-year repositioning and we must stay 
the course. 
The next phase to 2020 is all about 
performance delivery and financial discipline, 
as we marry customer-led gross margin 
growth with continuing to drive material 
levels of cost efficiency while maintaining 
capital discipline and a strong balance sheet. 
It is this combination, our track record to 
date and an excellent and committed team 
which give us confidence to pursue our 
medium-term goals of delivering growth 
and returns through satisfying the changing 
needs of our customers, deal with the 
uncertainties posed by any default tariff 
cap in the UK and indicate a stable dividend 
outlook within defined boundary conditions.
It is undeniable that at present Centrica 
faces a higher level of external uncertainty. 
It is therefore imperative that we focus 
on the things we can control to underpin 
our performance.
This is how we will rebuild shareholder 
value and confidence, and I am determined 
to demonstrate this through our actions, 
one step at a time.

Strategic context
In 2015 our Strategic Review was founded on an analysis of market trends 
and sources of growth, and the capabilities and efficiency necessary to 
pursue them profitably. 
The three fundamental trends we identified and which are changing the energy 
landscape – decentralisation, shifting of power to the customer and digitisation 
– are even clearer today and are playing out in line with our views at the time. 
Three macro-trends are driving 
the energy transition
Consumers and business customers show 
similar trends across all global markets:
Decentralisation 
Globally, as we pursue lower carbon and more efficient 
solutions, the energy system is becoming decentralised 
with more technologies available and viable, close to 
the customer.
Power to the customer
As a result of increased choice and alternatives, the 
customer is becoming more powerful. Owning the 
relationship with customers and satisfying their needs 
is fundamental.
Digitisation
Technological developments, both physical and digital, 
are accelerating the pace of change. Capability in these 
areas is key to keeping up with customers and their 
changing needs.
These trends demand more decentralised technologies and 
propositions, more customer intimacy and better service, more 
agility and stronger technology capability.
The result of all these changes is that the customer is increasingly 
powerful. That is why, at Centrica, we have put ‘satisfying the 
changing needs of our customers’ at the heart of our strategy.

Strategic Report | Our Strategy Strategic approach
To deliver the strategy we announced in July 2015, we set ourselves  
a number of medium-term objectives to 2020. We have organised the 
Group to deliver customer-led growth through two global customer-facing 
divisions and refocused our Exploration & Production business.
Our Strategy:
• To deliver for the changing needs of our customers
• To deliver long-term shareholder value through returns 
and growth
• To be a trusted corporate citizen
• To be an employer of choice
• To be a 21st century energy and services company
Our strategic objectives:
• Customer-led growth
• Smaller and more focused E&P business
• £1.5 billion resource reallocation from E&P and Central 
Power Generation to customer-facing businesses 2015/20
• £750 million per annum efficiency programme delivery 
by 2020
• Strong financial discipline within a clear framework
• Adjusted operating cash flow growth of 3-5% per annum 
Our focus areas for long-term growth:
• Energy Supply
• Services
• Connected Home
• Distributed Energy & Power
• Energy Marketing & Trading
We already have some or all of the characteristics of material market share, 
ability to manage large customer books and risk, strong product brands, leading 
capabilities and emerging products and offerings in these focus areas.
Identifying and managing risk is essential to delivering our strategy

Pages 52 to 62
Customer-facing  
divisions
In 2017 , we reorganised the Group around 
the customer, creating two new, customer-
facing divisions: Centrica Consumer and 
Centrica Business. The customer needs 
addressed by each division are global. 
We have built strategic frameworks around 
those needs that go beyond energy supply 
and target those areas where we believe we 
have real competitive advantage. 
Exploration & Production
Exploration & Production (E&P) will continue 
to play an important role for Centrica, but 
a more focused one. E&P provides diversity 
of cash flows and is a source of balance 
sheet strength. Following our divestment 
programme, the formation of Spirit Energy, 
and conversion of the Rough field to a 
producing asset, our E&P business will 
now be focused on Europe.

Business
Centrica plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 | 11 Our Business Model
Our business model is designed to deliver returns and growth through 
a focus predominantly on our customer-facing businesses.
Our Energy Supply, Services, Connected Home, Distributed Energy 
& Power and Energy Marketing & Trading businesses are organised 
into two global customer-facing divisions; Centrica Consumer 
is designed to support the needs of residential consumers and 
Centrica Business is designed to support the needs of the business 
customer. Each division has a strategic framework built around 
five pillars and these are set out in the diagram below. 
Our Central Power Generation business is included within the 
Centrica Business division, given its role in the management and 
optimisation of central power generation and its interface with 
wholesale markets. 
Our customer-facing businesses are supported by the common 
operating functions of Customer Operations and Field Operations. 
These functions are where we interact with the customer and are 
fundamental to our success.
Our remaining two business units, Exploration & Production and 
Centrica Storage, are operated separately and continue to play 
an important role in our portfolio.
To ensure our model remains efficient and scalable, all businesses 
are supported by a number of centre-led Group Functions that are 
responsible for setting boundaries and standards which allow us to 
effectively manage risk and ensure a strong system of internal control.

Centrica plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 | 13 The Strategic Repositioning  
of Centrica
Asset portfolio materially repositioned
In 2015, we announced a £500 million to 
£1 billion disposal programme which has 
delivered proceeds of over £900 million by 
the end of 2017 , including the disposals of:
Canada E&P £255m
Trinidad & Tobago E&P £26m
Combined cycle gas turbines £314m
Wind assets £308m
Exploration & Production (E&P)
In 2017 we created a new E&P business, 
Spirit Energy. Centrica owns 69%, with 
Bayerngas Norge’s former shareholders, 
led by Stadtwerke München Group, 
owning 31%.
Centrica Storage
Following extensive well testing, we 
concluded that the Rough facility was no 
longer capable of safe injection operations. 
We have been granted the necessary 
approvals to produce the indigenous 
gas and liquids from Rough before 
decommissioning.
Central Power Generation

At Centrica Business, we aim to be the 
partner that our business customers will 
turn to for advice on how best to manage 
their energy needs. 
Our business customers, like our residential 
customers, are cost conscious. They want 
their bills to be as low as possible and they 
want to increase their efficiency wherever 
they can. Energy is essential, so they need 
to know that their supply is resilient. 
Energy processes are complex. Our 
customers want an expert adviser to help 
them understand their energy use; a trusted 
and credible partner, who can deliver energy 
solutions as promised.

We want to create a fairer, more competitive and

Our commitments to customers
We have been listening to our customers and stakeholders. We froze our prices in the 
UK through the entire winter of 2016/17 until last August, longer than any other supplier, 
and introduced a loyalty reward scheme. But we recognise that we need to go further.
On 20 November 2017, we announced 
seven commitments to customers, 
which we are working to deliver. 
We will:
1.   End Standard Variable Tariffs (SVTs)  
for new customers
2.  Engage customers already on SVTs  
and offer them better deals
3.   Offer a choice of competitive fixed-term 
tariffs at the end of their contract
4. Introduce a new fixed-term default tariff
5.  Provide new offers to respond to 
customers’ changing needs
6.  Bring in simple, no-nonsense bills  
for all our customers
7 .  Continue improving our customer service 
and our own efficiency
Our actions alone won’t improve  
the market. So, we have asked  
the UK Government and Ofgem to:
1. Phase out SVTs altogether
2.  Level the playing field on social and 
environmental policy costs which are 
included in energy bills
3.  Move the funding of all government policy 
costs away from energy bills
4.  Make the smart meter roll-out more 
efficient and effective
5.  Be more consistent in the way vulnerable 
customers are treated
6.  Remove strict rules making energy 
bills complicated
7 .  Refresh the calculation of the price cap 
for customers on pre-payment meters
We feel these changes will be more effective than further government intervention 
in the shape of temporary price controls.

We have grown the Hive ecosystem, 
expanding the range of products and

lives easier. 
In 2017 , Connected Home launched 
new subscriptions plans across the UK,  
Ireland and North America, to enable our 
customers to choose the package that 
works for their home. This includes smart 
bulbs and plugs, door and window sensors 
and a new smart home security camera.
In the UK, we launched the Hive Leak Plan, 
a subscription service featuring the new 
Hive Leak Sensor. This monitors water flow 
around the home, notifying the customer 
of potential leaks through the Hive app and 
connecting the customer with a British Gas 
engineer, who can repair the problem.
We are bringing the benefit of our Hive 
products to customers across the world 
including Ireland, North America and Italy. 
In Italy, this is through our five-year 
partnership with energy supplier, Eni gas 
e luce. This has the potential to enable 
Eni’s eight million customers to access 
and use our products. Partnerships like 
this will increasingly be the focus for growing

Building workplace 
capabilities fit for 
the future 
We are making long-term investments in our 
engineers’ capabilities and tools so they are 
better equipped to serve our customers. 
In 2017 , we invested £8.6 million in training 
and developing the skills of our 11,000 strong 
UK network of engineers and apprentices. 
Together, they completed over 385,000 
hours of training last year. This equates to 
nearly one week per year for each engineer 
and will help them deliver a better customer 
experience across our full range of products 
and services – from boiler repairs to 
Connected Home devices.
We are also investing in technology so our 
engineers and technicians have the right 
tools at their fingertips. We have provided 
our engineers with smartphones so they 
can work more easily on the go. Our labs 
continue to develop new technologies and 
in 2017 , we enhanced our diagnostic tool, 
XSOL, improving its ability to identify 
problems. It now provides our engineers 
with full diagnostic information across 
nearly 1,000 different types of boilers 
enabling us to reduce the time taken to 
fix our customers’ boilers by 8%.

Texan colleagues 
and customers 
through Hurricane 
Harvey
In August 2017 , Texas was hit by Hurricane 
Harvey. We worked hard to support our 
people, customers and communities 
through this difficult time and help them 
rebuild their lives.
We delivered hurricane preparedness 
checklists and evacuation information before 
the hurricane struck, via bill inserts and direct 
mail. Our aim was to help customers to be 
as prepared as possible. To cushion the 
financial impact of the event, we suspended 
late payment fees and disconnections for 
customers in affected areas and offered 
them flexible or deferred payment plans. 
Our own people wanted to help too. So, we 
launched a Direct Energy donation page for 
them to pledge money to the American Red 
Cross who were co-ordinating the support 
effort in the hardest hit areas of Houston and 
Corpus Christi. This raised over US$50,000 
(£38,860) and Direct Energy made a 
matching donation.
The Direct Energy Back 
Office team was on the 
ground helping customers 
who really needed our 
personal attention after 
the devastation from 
Hurricane Harvey. The 
best part was seeing the 
relief on their faces.

Strategic Report | Centrica Consumer Going above and 
beyond to help 
our customers 
Our engineers and technicians make 
thousands of visits to our customers’ homes 
every week. In 2017 , across our business, 
our engineers made nearly 11 million visits 
to customers’ homes. 
On one of those visits, British Gas installations 
engineer, Adam Downend, rang the bell and 
didn’t get an answer. He called the phone 
number and could hear the phone ringing 
upstairs. Adam walked around the house 
and looked through the window to find the 
elderly customer lying on the sofa. After 
trying to get a response by banging on the 
window and shouting through the letter box, 
Adam then decided to gain access through 
an open bedroom window upstairs. Putting 
his ladder up to the window, he secured it 
safely and climbed in. When he got 
downstairs he found that the customer was 
barely conscious, so he put her in the 
recovery position and called for 
an ambulance. Adam then followed the 
instructions of the operator to keep her 
conscious while waiting for the paramedics 
to arrive and take her to hospital for treatment. 
When she got home, the customer thanked 
Adam for his help and quick thinking. 
We are in a real position to help our 
customers through the millions of visits 
we make to their homes each year.

Turning energy 
into an opportunity
With advances in technology, the energy market 
has evolved. Power increasingly lies in the hands 
of our customers, turning energy from a simple 
commodity into a critical source of business 
advantage. Customers are starting to use energy 
to gain a competitive edge, increase their resilience, 
improve operational efficiency and to help to 
futureproof their businesses.
Helping St George’s Hospital to deliver 
operational efficiency
St George’s Hospital in Tooting is the 
largest healthcare provider in South West 
London. It serves 1.3 million people and 
800,000 patients, as well as being a 
teaching hospital and advanced medical 
research centre. It employs over 8,500 
people. During 2017 , we continued 
working to deliver the hospital with end-
to-end solutions that improve their energy 
efficiency and operational performance, 
while reducing carbon emissions.
An energy centre is being installed to 
replace the existing 40-year-old system. 
This comprises a new combined heat 
and power plant, efficient boilers and 
lighting alongside heating, ventilation 
and air conditioning systems. Meanwhile, 
energy use is optimised through 
a building management system.

There has never been a more important time 
for us to work with businesses and other large 
energy users to develop solutions for them 
which can unlock new revenue streams, become 
a source of competitive advantage and drive 
growth. Our report, ‘Powering Britain’s Economic

demonstrate the benefits of distributed energy 
solutions. It assessed the potential economic 
benefits to the UK if three major sectors – 
Industrial, Health, and Hospitality & Leisure, 
which together represent over a quarter of the 
UK economy – were to adopt a range of solutions 
including battery storage, on-site power

and improving its resilience.
In January 2017 , we installed our energy 
insight solution, Panoramic Power, on the 
sixth floor of the building which houses part 
of the city’s government offices and data 
centre. The system uses sensors and cloud-
based analytics to transmit real-time data 
on energy use to the customer’s dashboard. 
This can be viewed on a desktop or mobile 
device and provides actionable insights to 
improve operational efficiency.
By capturing a variety of 
usage data, we are able 
to obtain a keen sense  
of consumption patterns 
and behaviour trends  
that will allow us to make 
more strategic decisions 
related to energy 
efficiency and capital

Strategic Report | Centrica Business Empowering 
Gateshead Council 
to cope with local 
energy spikes
Centrica has installed one of the country’s 
largest commercial battery storage schemes 
for Gateshead Council, giving it greater 
flexibility in managing its energy. The 3MW 
battery facility is equivalent to one million 
AA batteries and forms the final part of the 
Gateshead District Energy Centre, which 
also includes a pair of 2MW combined heat 
and power units. 
Centrica will manage the battery project 
under a 10-year contract. This scheme will 
help keep the national electricity network 
in balance by responding to any fluctuations 
on the system in less than a second. 
In time, it will also be used to strengthen 
Gateshead’s energy resilience by providing 
electricity to council-owned buildings 
through a private wire. 
This is a bold, imaginative 
scheme that means 
we can also store and 
release energy when 
we choose, as well as 
supporting the National 
Grid, which helps raise 
more income to support 
Council services.

aggregator
Whether it’s reducing energy usage at 
certain times, supplying energy back into 
the grid or increasing consumption when 
the grid is over-supplied, demand response 
is helping energy markets to become more 
flexible. Last year, we strengthened our 
ambitions in this area by acquiring REstore 
NV. It delivers cloud-based demand-side 
management software and demand 
response services to over 150 of Europe’s 
largest energy users, such as ArcelorMittal 
and Total. With these capabilities, we are 
now playing a leading role in reducing 
pressure on the electricity grid.

One example of how these efforts are 
helping our customers is Lineage Logistics 
Europe (formerly known as Partner Logistics), 
a frozen food warehousing company in the

the use of the cold store compressors and 
fans for short periods during peak demand 
without affecting overall operations. In return, 
Lineage Logistics Europe receives a reward 
from the electricity transmission system 
operator for being flexible, and the 
arrangement also helps the business to 
meet its own sustainability objectives. 
This will be a significant growth area for us as 
global markets for demand response evolve.

Making lives simpler and smarter
We are focused on saving our customers 
time and money, while making it easier for 
them to understand energy. 
Smart meters improve bill accuracy and 
empower customers to reduce their use 
by providing insight into how much energy 
they are using and its cost in real-time. 
Since 2009, we have led the smart meter 
roll-out in the UK, installing around five million 
in homes and businesses. Building on this, 
a simpler, no-nonsense British Gas bill will 
be introduced during 2018. 
We are making it easier for customers to 
control and optimise their energy. In 2017 , 
we established Centrica Innovations 
with a £100 million investment to build, 
collaborate and invest in purposeful start-
ups that will make energy work better 
for customers by focusing on control, 
convenience and affordability. Cumulatively, 
we have also sold over 1.6 million 
Connected Home products that can be 
controlled conveniently with just a tap on 
the app – from smart thermostats, plugs, 
lights and cameras, to window, door and 
motion sensors. 
We are investing in our customer service 
capabilities so that we can provide an 
excellent service. 
In 2017: 
• UK Home invested in training and 
intelligent call-routing;
• North America Home improved training 
and self-serve capability;
• Ireland increased training, process 
automation and enhanced customer-
facing IT platforms;
• UK Business strengthened bill accuracy 
and timeliness; and
• North America Business improved its 
online customer platform as well as digital 
journeys for acquisitions. 
Over time, these efforts will help reduce 
customer complaints and improve 
satisfaction.

Centrica plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 | 33 Powering competitive advantage
Through our Distributed Energy & Power 
(DE&P) business, we are giving large-scale 
energy users the power to operate and 
optimise their energy so that they can use 
it more efficiently. This increases their 
operational resilience and unlocks new 
sources of revenue for growth. In 2017 , 
we made it easier to harness these benefits 
by launching our offer to businesses under 
a new Centrica Business Solutions banner, 
providing end-to-end customer solutions – 
from flexible and local generation, battery 
storage and energy efficiency measures, 
to smart building management systems 
and energy trading technologies. 
Key sectors in the UK could save millions

Helping those in need
We have worked hard to deliver a fairer, more 
competitive energy market for everyone, 
especially those in need. Having cut prices 
in 2016, however, we made the difficult 
decision to increase them in 2017 . British 
Gas’ electricity prices rose by 12.5% due to 
an increase in costs relating to energy policy 
and the delivery to customers’ homes. 
Similarly, Bord Gáis Energy put up prices 
by 5.9% for electricity and 3.4% for gas, 
following a rise in wholesale energy costs 
and distributing energy to the network. 
In the UK, we have set out a range of initiatives 
to help drive engagement with the energy 
market and ensure customers get a better 
deal. This includes closing our standard 
variable tariff to all new customers and 
introducing fixed-term competitive tariffs 
(see page 18).
In 2017 , we helped over one million vulnerable 
customer households through mandatory 
and voluntary schemes.
This included:
•  667 ,900 customers accessing bill 
assistance via the UK’s Warm Home 
Discount scheme and North America’s 
Neighbor-to-Neighbor programme; 
•  297 ,000 customers supported with bill 
assistance following Hurricane Harvey 
in North America; 
•  26,900 customers and non-customers 
helped with debt advice and grants 
through the British Gas Energy Trust; and
• 53,200 households receiving energy 
efficiency improvements via the UK’s 
Energy Company Obligation, while five 
communities benefited from Ireland’s 
Better Energy Communities scheme. 
Our award-winning customer service training 
ensures we identify and support those who 
need a helping hand. By the end of 2017 , 
over 21,000 employees had become 
Dementia Friends, improving our ability to 
help those living with the condition. We also 
supported the development of industry 
guidance that will enable the utility sector 
to become dementia-friendly. 
Innovative products and services are 
creating a better world for people with 
disabilities and those in later life. In 2017 
for example, we launched a video relay 
service for customers who use British Sign 
Language, allowing them to interact with us 
much more effectively.

centrica.com/ourdiversity
Building skills for the future
We are creating a workforce fit for the future 
by investing in our people’s development and 
providing opportunities that attract a diverse 
array of talent. 
In 2017:
•  15,000 engineers, technicians and 
apprentices enhanced their skills, 
supported with an investment of more 
than £10 million in training;
•  5,800 employees seized the opportunity 
to learn new skills through volunteering, 
generating 57 ,300 volunteering hours; and
• 180 young people developed workplace 
skills on our graduate programmes. 
We are known for our world-class engineering 
apprenticeships. We are building on this 
success by expanding our customer service 
apprenticeships and providing new ones in 
leadership, management and digital amongst 
other areas during 2018. 
We are using our expertise to nurture the 
skills that our society needs. Since 2010, 
we have reached nearly 562,000 young 
people with our curriculum-based lesson 
plans, helping to improve skills in the key 
areas of science, technology, engineering 
and maths (STEM). Over the past four years, 
we have also helped 1,160 young, 
unemployed people to secure workplace 
skills through the Movement to Work 
scheme. Around 60% of scheme 
participants went on to secure permanent 
employment or further training. We will 
provide a further 300 places in 2018.
Embracing workforce diversity
Reflecting the diversity of our customers 
and communities in our workforce is vital 
if we are to attract and retain the talent to 
satisfy our customers. We are working hard 
to become a more diverse and inclusive 
workplace and in 2017 , we launched a new 
Disability and Wellbeing Employee Network 
to complement our other employee 
networks. Business in the Community (BITC) 
have recognised our efforts in this area, 
awarding us a Bronze award for our 
commitment to gender and race inclusion.

Our success depends on our people. 
That is why we want our people to stay safe 
and why we respect and respond to their 
needs. We have robust processes in place 
to uphold equal pay and reward our people 
fairly, which includes paying at least the 
Living Wage in the UK and taking action 
to close the gender pay gap. We also 
conduct an employee engagement survey 
to understand how our people feel, so that 
we can improve our result.

Centrica plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 | 35 Enabling the low carbon transition
We are tackling climate change by reducing 
emissions across our business and providing 
products and services that lead to a lower 
carbon future. 
Helping customers cut  
their carbon emissions
More than 90% of our carbon emissions are 
associated with the energy consumed by 
our customers. So the biggest contribution 
we can make in tackling climate change is 
to help them cut their carbon by using our 
energy efficiency and Connected Home 
products, alongside the solutions offered 
by our DE&P business. We calculate this has 
saved our customers nearly 31mtCO 2e since 
2008 – equivalent to the annual emissions 
of around nine million UK homes.
Decarbonising the energy system
Centrica is revolutionising the way energy 
is generated, managed and consumed, 
by leading the transition to a decentralised 
energy system that enhances grid flexibility, 
supports renewables and reduces reliance 
on fossil fuels.
During 2017 , we:
•  created Centrica Business Solutions, 
a one-stop-shop for large-scale  
energy users to harness distributed 
energy products and services; 
•  completed a 3MW battery storage 
scheme for Gateshead Council, to help 
keep the national electricity network 
in balance;
•  invested £62 million to acquire REstore, 
Europe’s leading demand-response 
aggregator, enabling us to counter grid 
imbalance by managing demand from 
commercial and industrial customers; and
•  launched a £180 million investment 
programme to build three new flexible 
power generation facilities and one of 
the world’s largest battery storage 
facilities, to meet peaks in local demand 
and back-up intermittent renewables.
We are additionally playing an important role 
in growing the infrastructure needed to lower 
emissions from transport, having installed 
around 13,000 electric vehicle charge points 
since 2013.

Pages 24 to 29
Reducing operational impact
We have shifted away from being a large-
scale energy producer and now emit over 
70% less carbon for every pound of revenue 
than we did in 2010.
In 2017 , our total carbon emissions 
decreased by 19%. This was mainly due 
to the sale of our Exploration & Production 
business in Canada and two power plants 
in the UK. The average carbon intensity 
of our Central Power Generation remained 
relatively stable at 125gCO 2/kWh. Instead 
of generating power for our customers, 
we will now predominantly buy it for re-sale 
from third parties. 
Meanwhile, the internal carbon footprint 
of our property, fleet and travel reduced 
11% in 2017 . The decline was achieved 
through planned carbon reduction activities 
alongside headcount reductions arising from 
the reorganisation of our business. Following 
these changes, we are reassessing our 
targets for both carbon intensity of Central 
Power Generation and internal carbon 
footprint (see page 220).

Strategic Report | Responsible Business Building strong communities
We are increasing the positive impact our presence 
has in society by working with communities to address 
key issues, while contributing to the local economy. 
Developing local energy markets
Through our DE&P business, we are 
exploring the potential for local energy 
markets to put communities in control of 
their energy, drive down bills and unlock 
further renewable generation.
Towards this in 2017 , Centrica Innovations 
acquired a stake in LO3, a start-up with 
a focus on developing peer-to-peer power 
market trading and were involved in the 
Brooklyn local energy market in New York.
Collaborating to help communities
Our strategic partnerships are building 
a better future – whether it’s helping 
vulnerable households with their energy 
(see page 34), or tackling bad housing and 
homelessness. To support these issues in 
2017 , we invested £156 million in mandatory, 
voluntary and charitable contributions. 
A further £10 million has been committed 
to start-ups developing innovative energy 
ideas that benefit society, helping 38,000 
people since 2013.
Cornwall’s energy ambitions
At the end of 2016, we announced a £19 million local energy market trial in Cornwall, UK. The 
three-year trial will test how flexible demand, generation and storage can reduce pressure on 
the electricity grid, enable the growth of renewables and avoid expensive network upgrades. 
Since then, over 300 homes and businesses registered to get involved and in 2017 , we 
welcomed our first business to the trial – a working farm and holiday retreat. Pioneering 
battery storage technology was installed to help them better manage the energy generated 
by their solar panels. In 2018, we expect to roll-out storage and solar panels in 100 homes 
and commence larger installations of storage, renewables and distributed generation across 
15 businesses.
We believe our trial will not only help Cornwall realise its energy ambitions, but lead the way for 
the UK and other countries to do the same.

During 2017 , we generated £1,591 million 
in wages for our 33,140-strong workforce 
and we contributed £307 million in taxes. 
We also spent nearly £4 billion on goods 
and services, supporting 36,000 suppliers 
and thousands of jobs. 
Distributed energy solutions have the 
potential to generate widespread economic 
benefits. It is estimated that these solutions 
could help the UK meet decarbonisation 
targets more effectively, saving £8 billion 
a year by 2030

. Likewise, key sectors could 
save millions of pounds each year while 
boosting the economy (see page 34).

Being a good corporate citizen
We are committed to working with integrity 
so that we can maximise the positive 
impact we have in society. To support this, 
we launched a new Company-wide set of 
values and a code of conduct in 2017/18. 
Taken together, our Values and Our Code, 
demonstrate our commitment to being 
a responsible business and bind us 
together in common pursuit of our strategy 
and purpose. 
Through Our Code, we reaffirmed that we 
will ensure our business partners and third 
parties share our dedication to eliminate 
bribery and corruption. We do not condone 
any payments we feel to be improper and 
take particular care when offering or 
receiving gifts and hospitality. We prohibit all 
forms of fraudulent conduct or dishonest 
behaviour and will report any serious matters 
to the relevant authorities. We also set out 
that we respect and uphold the fundamental 
human rights and freedoms of everyone 
who works for us, with us or lives in our local 
communities. As part of our response to the 
Modern Slavery Act in the UK, we have taken 
action to reduce risk relating to forced or 
compulsory labour in our business and 
supply chain. 
In 2017 , we assessed 138 suppliers on 
their social, ethical and environmental 
standards to guard against risks such as 
human rights and bribery and corruption. 
This resulted in an average supplier 
sustainability score of 56 (low risk), which 
is better than the multi-industry average 
of 44 (medium risk). If suppliers receive a 
medium or high-risk rating, we will consider 
appropriate next steps which may include 
collaborating to raise standards or ending 
our relationship and reporting the abuse.

Strategic Report | Responsible Business Our approach
Wherever we do business in the world, 
we take great care to ensure we fully comply 
with all of our obligations to pay or collect 
taxes and to meet local reporting and 
disclosure requirements.
We fully disclose information on ownership, 
transactions and financing structures to the 
relevant tax authorities. Our cross-border tax 
reporting reflects the underlying commercial 
reality of our business.
We are committed to providing disclosures 
and information necessary to assist 
understanding beyond that required by 
law and regulation.
We ensure that income and costs, 
including costs of financing operations, 
are appropriately recognised on a fair 
and sustainable basis across all countries 
where the Group has a business presence. 
We understand that this is not an exact 
science and we engage openly with tax 
authorities to explain our approach.
In the UK we maintain a transparent and 
constructive relationship with Her Majesty’s 
Revenue & Customs (HMRC). This includes 
regular, open dialogue on issues of 
significance to HMRC and Centrica. 
Our relationship with fiscal authorities 
in other countries where we do business 
is conducted on the same principles.
We carefully manage the tax risks and costs 
inherent in every commercial transaction, 
in the same way as any other cost. However, 
we do not enter into artificial arrangements 
in order to avoid taxation nor to defeat the 
stated purpose of tax legislation.
We actively engage in consultation with 
governments on tax policy where we believe 
we are in a position as a Group to provide 
valuable commercial insight.
The Group’s tax charge, taxes 
paid and the UK tax charge
The Group’s businesses are subject to 
corporate income tax rates as set out 
in the statutory tax rates on profits table.  
The overall tax charge is therefore 
dependent on the mix of profits and the 
tax rate to which those profits are subject.

Our View on Taxation
The Group takes its obligations to pay and collect 
the correct amount of tax very seriously. Responsibility 
for tax governance and strategy lies with the Group 
Chief Financial Officer, overseen by the Board and 
the Audit Committee.

Strategic Report | Business Review UK Home
Our leading position in UK energy supply 
and services remains core to our business 
and we are making good progress on our 
transformational journey to improve 
customer service levels, reduce costs 
and develop propositions to expand and 
deepen relationships with households.  
Delivering high levels of customer service 
is fundamental and total energy supply 
complaints fell by 224,000, or 20% per 
100,000 customers, as we continued to 
invest in transforming customer journeys 
and agent training. However, the number  
of services complaints increased by around 
31,000, or 30% per 100,000 customers, 
reflecting operational disruption following 
the centralisation of planning and dispatch 
activities. Our engineer customer visit net 
promoter score (NPS) remained high at 67 
and we remain highly focused on improving 
customer service levels in 2018. UK Home 
Brand NPS reduced by 2pts to + 1
†
, reflecting 
the impact of our standard tariff electricity 
price increase in September and a broader 
negative sentiment surrounding UK 
energy suppliers.
Cost efficiency is also fundamental in 
allowing us to maintain a competitive pricing 
position. Annualised cost per home account 
fell by 8% compared to 2016, with efficiencies 
realised through our new operating model 
including the combination of multiple 
customer operations teams into one 
organisation, lower incoming call volumes 
resulting from investment in our digital 
platform which has made it easier to 
complete transactions online, consolidation 
of our planning and dispatch activities, and 
the integration of seven separate field forces 
into one. Our leaner, more efficient operating 
model has also enabled us to improve our 
speed to take new offers to market, for 
example digital, rewards and bundling. 
Total energy customer account holdings fell 
by 1,376,000, or 10%, during 2017 , including 
the roll-off of 967 ,000 low-margin collective 
switch and white-label fixed price tariffs. The 
remaining 409,000 account losses include 
195,000 prepayment customers, with the 
remaining 214,000 reflecting market 
switching trends. Within this, in line with our 
strategy to reduce the number of customers 
on the Standard Variable Tariff (SVT), we saw 
a 14% drop in SVT account holdings and 
an increase in the number of customers on 
British Gas fixed-term tariffs. The number of 
services accounts was flat, with growth of 
77 ,000 in the second half of the year 
reflecting an increased focus on offers 
targeted at higher value energy customers 
and the deployment of digital offers to 
partner channels. 
Our UK services business completed 
nine million customer visits in 2017 and 
remains a source of competitive advantage 
in the UK given our nationwide scale which 
is very difficult to replicate. In 2017 , we further 
strengthened our services offer with the UK 
nationwide launch of our technology-led 
Local Heroes on demand services platform, 
which plays towards the market trend of 
more customers seeking on demand and 
home emergency offers. Local Heroes 
provides customers with access to local 
tradespeople backed by a British Gas 
guarantee, and growth accelerated 
throughout 2017 , with over 7 ,000 
tradespeople signed up and 25,000 jobs 
now completed.
In the fourth quarter we developed new 
customer offers targeted at increasing 
customer value, including the launch of 
our online-only tariff, bundling energy with 
services or connected home products and 
more sophisticated risk-based services 
pricing. We will continue to develop these 
offers further in 2018. We launched British 
Gas Rewards in April, which uses our data to 
gain a deeper understanding of customer 
preferences and allows customers to select 
personalised offers, like loyalty energy days. 
Over 700,000 customers have signed up to 
date and we are already seeing greater 
customer engagement, with retention rates 
1.5ppt higher for customers signed up to 
British Gas Rewards. 
We continue to lead the industry in the smart 
meter roll-out and have now installed around 
five million smart meters in UK homes, 
providing customers with additional insight 
on their energy usage and bringing an end 
to estimated bills for customers, reducing the 
number of calls we receive relating to billing 
and meter reading queries. 
Overall UK Home adjusted operating profit 
was up 1% to £819 million, within which 
energy supply profit was up 3% to 
£572 million. Energy gross margin reduced 
by 4%, reflecting the impact of warmer 
weather, lower customer account holdings 
and the implementation of the prepayment 
cap which came into effect in April 2017 as 
a result of the Competition and Markets 
Authority remedies. However, these negative 
impacts were more than offset by strong 
cost efficiency progress. Services gross 
margin was down 10%, which includes the 
impact of an increase in pension costs and 
lower average customer account holdings 
through the year. However, cost efficiency 
progress was strong and as a result, 
operating profit was down by less, by 4% 
to £247 million.
Ireland
Our Irish business, Bord Gáis Energy, 
performed well in 2017 , and, as in the UK 
and North America, we are offering a wider 
choice of products to our customers. 
We continue to focus on customer service, 
with increased training, robotics process 
automation and enhancements to our 
customer-facing IT platforms all contributing 
to an 18% reduction in complaints. We also 
successfully upgraded our enterprise billing 
platform in the year, which will support 
increased digitisation over the coming years. 
NPS fell by 3 points to + 17
†
, reflecting a 
more negative customer perception of 
energy suppliers following the fourth quarter 
price increases. 
Total customer account holdings fell by 
13,000, or 2%, reflecting increased market 
competition, including from new entrants into 
the market. However, electricity customer 
account holdings increased by 7 ,000, or 2%, 
as we successfully converted more of our 
customers to a dual fuel offering. As in the UK 
and North America, we are offering a wider 
choice of products to our customers and 
having launched our range of Hive automation 
products in Ireland in the first half of the year, 
we are focused on building brand awareness 
around our Connected Home propositions.
Whitegate, our flexible gas fired power 
station, recorded another good performance, 
with a load factor of 85% and total generation 
volumes of 3,228GWh, up 3% compared 
to 2016.
Adjusted operating profit was up 2% 
compared to 2016, although down 4%  
in local currency. This reflects the impact  
of a competitive environment, which was 
broadly offset by cost efficiencies and good 
performance from our trading and power 
generation business. Adjusted operating cash 
flow was down 26% compared to 2016, which 
benefited from a one-off payment related to 
the cessation of a gas storage contract.
Centrica plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 | 41 North America Home
As in the UK, energy supply and services 
remains core to our customer offer in 
North America and we are well positioned 
to expand and deepen relationships 
with households.  
We remain focused on improving the 
sustainability of our business in our chosen 
markets by improving customer service 
levels, reducing costs and developing 
innovative and differentiated offers. 
We delivered further improvements in 
customer service in 2017 , with additional 
training provided for our customer service 
agents to improve customer interactions, 
and enhancements to our digital platform 
enabling improved self-serve capability. 
These actions contributed to a 22% 
reduction in complaints compared to 2016, 
while our online reputation improved 
significantly. Brand NPS also increased in the 
second half of the year and ended 1pt higher 
than at the end of 2016.
Cost efficiency remains a core priority.  
The integration of our energy and services 
business combined with the disposal of non-
core businesses in 2016 has allowed us to 
simplify our processes further, reduce 
headcount and consolidate office locations. 
We have now closed or sold a number of 
loss-making services businesses in non-
core markets and have completed our exit 
from the residential solar market, which we 
announced in July. Centrica’s participation 
in commercial solar in North America will 
continue as a part of the Distributed Energy 
& Power (DE&P) customer offering. Overall, 
annualised cost per home account fell by 2%. 
The total number of energy supply accounts 
fell by 327 ,000, or 11%, during 2017 . In the 
US North East, customer account holdings 
fell by 18%, driven by a competitive pricing 
environment and the loss of 108,000 low-
margin aggregated auction customers. 
In Texas, customer account holdings were 
down 7% due to competitive pressure and 
a pause of door-to-door sales due to 
regulatory concerns. However, in the second 
half of the year customer retention improved 
in Texas, compared to the second half of 
2016, reflecting higher levels of customer 
service and proactive renewal of customers 
on fixed contracts. In Canada, regulatory 
changes required us to cease our door-to-
door sales channel which contributed to a 
customer account decline of 6%. However, 
we have now entered into a number of retail 
partnerships that will expand our number of 
sales channels. Services customer account 
holdings were broadly flat compared to 
2016, although within this paid Direct Energy 
protection plans rose 18%.
We are focused on differentiating our 
customer offer and developing bundled 
propositions. Direct Energy is currently a key 
channel for Hive products in North America 
with 80,000 Hive hubs having been sold with 
an energy supply tariff. In 2017 , 21% of 
energy sales were bundled with one or more 
product or offer, such as a protection plan or 
a Hive product, compared to 17% in 2016. 
North America Home adjusted operating 
profit increased by 28% and adjusted 
operating cash flow was up 5%. Within this, 
energy supply gross margin was up 2% 
despite the fall in customer account holdings, 
reflecting our focus on more valuable 
customer segments, while adjusted 
operating profit was up 6% which includes 
the benefit of cost efficiencies. Services 
gross margin was down by 7% reflecting the 
closure of the solar business, which when 
combined with other actions taken to 
improve efficiency resulted in a reduced 
adjusted operating loss. 
Connected Home
Our Connected Home business is utilising 
technology to provide offers that meet 
customer needs across the strategic pillars 
of peace of mind, home energy management 
and home automation.  
It is also an important source of 
differentiation for our energy and services 
businesses and the NPS for British Gas 
customers who have a Hive product is 
10 points higher than those who do not. 
In 2017 , we launched three new products, 
the Hive Camera, Hive Leak and, in North 
America, the Hive Active Thermostat with 
air-conditioning; while in January 2018 we 
launched our new camera, Hive View. These 
new products take Connected Home more 
deeply into the peace of mind pillar, as we 
deepen our diagnostics capability to provide 
additional comfort to home owners. 
Additional planned product, proposition 
and feature launches in 2018 will strengthen 
our customer offer further. 
The full range of Hive automation products 
was launched in North America and Ireland 
during the year, while we also signed our 
first strategic partnership deal outside of 
our core energy and services markets. Our 
partnership with Italian energy company 
Eni gas e luce will provide their 8 million 
customers in Italy with access to the full 
range of Hive home automation products. 
We continue to integrate with other 
connected home eco-systems, including 
through our successful partnership with 
Amazon Echo, where 23% of our customers 
have used Alexa, Amazon’s voice assistant, 
in combination with Hive.
We sold 373,000 connected hubs in 2017 , 
taking the total number installed to 900,000. 
Hive products are now being sold through 
around 50 retailers in the UK and we have 
sold over 1.6 million Connected Home 
products in total, with the number of 
products per hub increasing to 1.8 by the 
end of 2017 compared to 1.4 at the start 
of the year. 
We now have 94,000 customers on 
subscription offers or payment plans. 
This includes 51,000 ‘Boiler IQ’, which uses 
sensors to remotely diagnose boiler faults, 
and 43,000 on Hive propositions including 
‘Welcome Home’, ‘Close to Home’ and our 
heating and cooling plans in the UK, Ireland 
and North America. These propositions 
enable customers to personalise, control 
and interact with their home through the Hive 
product range. 
Gross revenue increased by 27% to 
£42 million, reflecting increased sales of 
hubs and products from our more diverse 
product range, with gross margins remaining 
attractive at around 20%. Connected Home 
reported an increased adjusted operating 
loss and adjusted operating cash outflow, 
reflecting higher investment in product and 
platform development, app user experience 
and customer acquisition costs.
Business Review (continued)
Strategic Report | Business Review
42 | Centrica plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 UK Business
UK Business adjusted operating profit fell 
significantly in 2017 .  
This reflects the negative impacts of 
additional costs resulting from commodity 
volatility and energy volume settlements in 
the first quarter of 2017 , relating to 2016, 
warmer weather and the impact of increased 
competition on customer account holdings.
The combination of these factors resulted 
in a 30% fall in gross margin in 2017 , 
which was only partially offset by further 
cost efficiencies and reductions in bad 
debt, the latter enabled by improved 
operational performance. 
Operationally, UK Business delivered 
improved customer outcomes in 2017 , 
with better timeliness and accuracy of 
customer bills. This helped drive an 8% 
reduction in call volumes and a 24% 
reduction in complaints compared to 2016. 
However, customer account holdings fell 
64,000 or 9%, with around half the losses 
in Industrial and Commercial, reflecting our 
decision not to pursue renewal of some 
low value multi-site contracts, but also 
increasing competitive intensity. The 
remaining losses were of small and medium 
(SME) customers, reflecting competitive 
intensity with 67 active competitors and 
high levels of switching activity. 
Against this competitive backdrop, we are 
focusing our retention and acquisition 
activities on the higher value SME segments, 
continuing to build relationships with energy 
brokers and improving our customer portal 
facilities to allow them to manage their whole 
portfolio online. This has led to an increase 
in broker-led acquisitions, which should aid 
our commercial performance. In 2018, 
we expect some recovery in gross margin 
given a more normal weather and 
commodity environment, and, combined 
with further cost efficiency, expect adjusted 
operating profit to improve towards the levels 
seen in 2016.
Adjusted operating profit of £4 million was 
down 92% in 2017 , reflecting the additional 
costs in the first quarter, warmer weather 
and lower customer account holdings, partly 
offset by cost efficiencies and bad debt 
reductions. Working capital management 
has remained a key area of focus, and 
reflecting this, adjusted operating cash flow 
was £131 million despite the material 
reduction in operating profit.
North America Business
North America Business delivered a poor 
financial result in the second half of the year, 
with adjusted gross margin down 26% and 
adjusted operating profit down 68%.  
The drivers of lower gross margin were 
primarily in the power retail business. Total 
power adjusted gross margin was down 
51%, reflecting increased competitive 
intensity, changes to the market structure 
and related input costs, including higher unit 
capacity charges, and the impact of warmer 
weather on consumption and a subsequent 
under recovery of unitised non-commodity 
costs. The financial result also includes a one-
off non-cash charge of £76 million (£46 million 
post-tax) relating to a reassessment of 
the historic recognition of unbilled power 
revenues. In addition, warmer weather 
reduced opportunities for gas optimisation, 
however, our gas retail business performed 
well and overall gas gross margin was 
slightly up.
In response to the challenges we faced 
in 2017 , we have taken actions to drive 
improvements in profitability and reduce 
volatility in the retail power book. These 
include introducing a new standard product 
offering that more closely matches input 
cost recovery, completion of system 
enhancements to provide greater granularity 
of gross margin drivers, and improvements 
to the processes and controls around our 
load forecasting and risk management 
reporting. We also implemented several 
enhancements to our online customer 
platform during 2017 , with improved 
response times on issue resolution and an 
enhanced digital journey for acquisitions 
helping improve the customer experience. 
Our digital Energy Portfolio platform, 
launched in the second half of 2016, has also 
given customers direct access to our energy 
expertise while providing dynamic energy 
procurement options. In addition, we made 
improvements to our billing processes and, 
reflecting all of this, complaints fell 38% 
compared to 2016 and NPS increased by  
2 points to +33
†
. 
We continue to expand our offering into 
new geographies and delivered higher sales 
in our key growth areas of the US Mid-
Continent, California and Canada. Overall, 
total customer account holdings reduced by 
20,000 during 2017 , which reflects a focus 
on higher value accounts and a reduction in 
our small business accounts. However, the 
competitive environment impacted our sold 
unit margins, down 20% in power and 22% 
in gas for new contracts.
An increased focus on energy efficiency has 
lowered power usage per customer across 
the industry and we are well positioned to 
benefit from this market trend, with North 
America Business working closely with the 
DE&P business to develop joint propositions 
to deepen the customer relationship. North 
America Business continues to be an 
important sales channel for distributed 
energy products, including Panoramic 
Power’s wireless energy insight management 
solutions. Over 11,000 sensors were 
deployed to Direct Energy customers in 
2017 . We are also planning to expand our 
combined heat and power offering in North 
America following the acquisition of ENER-G 
Cogen in 2016, while the DE&P acquisition 
of demand response company REstore 
provides additional capability. 
North America Business reported a 68% 
fall in adjusted operating profit and a 69% 
reduction in adjusted operating cash flow. 
Around half of the reduction in adjusted 
operating profit reflects the impact of the 
competitive environment, warmer weather, 
fewer optimisation opportunities and the 
impact of higher capacity costs, with the 
other half reflecting the one-off non-cash 
charge. In 2018, we are focused on 
continuing to deliver a high-quality customer 
experience, targeted offers for higher value 
customer segments and offering an 
increasing range of DE&P products and 
propositions. However, we expect to see 
continued competitive pressure on electricity 
supply margins and, therefore, growth in 
adjusted operating profit will be limited, after 
adjusting for the impact of the one-off non-
cash charge.
Centrica plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 | 43 Distributed Energy & Power
Distributed Energy & Power (DE&P) is 
focused on the three Centrica Business 
strategic pillars of energy insight, energy 
optimisation and energy solutions.  
Since the formation of the DE&P business 
unit in the second half of 2015, we have 
grown our capability both organically and 
inorganically. The targeted acquisitions of 
Panoramic Power, REstore and ENER-G 
Cogen provide us with strong positions in 
each of the three strategic pillars and enable 
us to capitalise on the global trend towards 
distributed energy and to develop a range  
of products and services to meet the needs 
of customers. 
Our subscription-based Panoramic Power 
energy insight product provides customers 
with real-time visibility of their energy usage 
plus actionable insights. We now have 
53,000 sensors deployed across more than 
1,800 sites in 30 countries and are collecting 
around 14 billion data points per month. 
It has proved successful in changing the 
dynamic of the conversation with customers 
and provides opportunities to cross-sell 
energy optimisation and solutions services. 
We acquired REstore, Europe’s leading 
demand response aggregator, in November. 
REstore provides key capabilities in energy 
optimisation and provides over 850MW of 
flexible power capacity to grid operators. 
The power is aggregated from a 2.2GW 
flexible portfolio of industrial and commercial 
customers across Belgium, the UK, France 
and Germany and generates value for 
businesses through ancillary services 
including frequency response and capacity 
markets. Through this acquisition, demand 
response aggregation will become a core 
part of our offer to customers, and DE&P’s 
optimisation capacity has now increased 
to 1.9GW.
In energy solutions, DE&P now has over 
1,400 long-term contracted sites and active 
solutions, mostly CHP-based, in 13 countries, 
having sold both off-the-shelf and bespoke 
end-to-end solutions. We have also 
expanded our distributed solutions offering 
in North America, which will be a major focus 
area for growth. 
In total, the number of DE&P active customer 
sites has increased by 22% over the past  
12 months, with growth particularly strong in  
the fourth quarter. Total secured revenue, our 
forward order book, increased 24% in 2017 . 
DE&P also includes our fleet of smaller gas 
fired peaking plants at Brigg, Peterborough 
and Barry. Construction is progressing well 
on our three new flexible generation projects, 
a 49MW battery storage facility at Roosecote 
and two 50MW fast response gas fired 
plants at Brigg and Peterborough. All three 
have 15-year capacity contracts starting in 
October 2020 and were successful in the 
2018/19 T-1 capacity auction.
We continue to innovate in Local Energy 
Markets and now have over 300 homes and 
businesses registered to take part in our 
three-year trial in Cornwall. In 2017 we 
installed the largest flow battery in the UK 
and in 2018 we expect to install storage 
and solar PV in 100 homes and commence 
larger installations of storage, renewables 
and distributed generation across up to 
15 businesses as part of the trial. 
DE&P gross revenue increased by 6% 
compared to 2016, and by 34% on an 
underlying basis when reflecting the impacts 
of the disposal of the non-core building 
energy management systems business and 
the scaling back of our UK solar business 
following the removal of the feed-in-tariff. 
This growth reflects the organic increase 
in customer sites and a full year impact from 
ENER-G Cogen, which was acquired in May 
2016. DE&P reported an increased adjusted 
operating loss of £53 million and an 
increased adjusted operating cash outflow 
of £30 million, reflecting increased 
headcount to build new capability and higher 
investment in the development of new 
customer propositions, sales channels and 
technology to drive growth. We expect DE&P 
to deliver continued revenue and gross 
margin growth in 2018, although we will 
continue to make further investment to drive 
this growth and therefore expect the current 
year operating loss to be similar to 2017 .

44 | Centrica plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Energy Marketing & Trading
Energy Marketing & Trading (EM&T) is focused 
on the Centrica Business strategic pillars of 
energy optimisation and wholesale energy.  
In addition to expanding its route to market 
offers, global LNG presence, and trading and 
optimisation activities across Europe, EM&T 
continues to serve its core purpose of 
managing commodity profit risk and 
providing wholesale market access for  
the Group.
The acquisition of Neas Energy in October 
2016 has enhanced EM&T’s capabilities and 
geographical reach, as well as giving EM&T 
access to Neas’ advanced optimisation 
platform, Neas Direct, which provides 
hedging and optimisation strategies and 
route to market services to our customers. 
EM&T now serves customers who own 
decentralised assets with installed capacity 
of around 10GW, predominantly in Denmark, 
the UK, Germany and Sweden, enabling 
them to access our expertise to capture 
value and provide flexibility services to their 
assets. Neas Energy has performed ahead 
of expectations since its acquisition, and it 
delivered a strong trading and optimisation 
result in 2017 , particularly in the first half of 
the year during periods of power volatility 
in Northern European markets. 
In LNG, we continue to expand our global 
business in advance of the first delivery 
from our contract with Cheniere, which is 
expected in September 2019 from the 
Sabine Pass facility in Louisiana. We have 
built a full range of LNG trading, optimisation 
and operations capability and continue to 
transact multiple free on board and delivered 
ex-ship cargoes from a range of locations 
globally. In November, we traded our 
hundredth cargo outside the UK, just three 
years after trading our first cargo. 
EM&T has major flexible legacy gas contracts 
and associated hedges with take or pay 
arrangements, where the payments are 
made for gas even if delivery is deferred to 
future periods. These were inherited by 
Centrica on demerger and are part of an 
overall profitable Centrica portfolio. The profit 
and cash flow from these contracts and 
hedges will vary between periods based on 
the commodity price environment and 
decisions we take to optimise them. In 2017 , 
the three remaining contracts and 
associated hedging generated £36 million 
of gross margin, having made £118 million 
of gross margin in 2016, reflecting our take 
or pay strategy to maximise the contracts’ 
value over their lives. During 2018, the two 
historically most profitable flexible legacy 
gas contracts will end, leaving one contract 
which expires in 2025 and is currently 
expected to be loss-making based on the 
current level of gas prices. As a result, we 
currently expect 2018 EM&T adjusted 
operating profit to be no more than half the 
level of 2017 . This contract will continue to be 
managed for value and we will look to utilise 
the contract optionality to capture favourable 
market conditions as they arise.
EM&T adjusted operating profit was 
£104 million in 2017 compared to 
£161 million in 2016, although, after 
excluding the contribution from the flexible 
legacy gas contracts, adjusted operating 
profit associated with core EM&T activities 
increased by 58% to £68 million. This 
underlying increase reflects further strong 
trading and optimisation and route-to-market 
performance and a full year’s impact of the 
Neas Energy acquisition. Adjusted operating 
cash flow increased by 32% to £262 million, 
predominantly reflecting the timing of cash 
flows associated with the flexible gas 
contracts between 2016 and 2017 .
Central Power Generation
With our focus for growth on distributed 
energy and flexible generation, we made 
further significant progress in 2017 to reduce 
the scale of our Central Power Generation 
business in line with our strategy. 
In February 2017 , we completed our exit 
from wind power generation with the 
disposal of our 50% interest in the Lincs 
Wind Farm for £214 million. The sale resulted 
in an exceptional pre-tax profit on disposal of 
£64 million (post-tax £58 million). In August, 
we completed the sale of our large combined 
cycle gas turbines (CCGTs) at Langage and 
South Humber Bank and the Kings Lynn B 
CCGT development project for £314 million 
in total, which resulted in a total pre-tax 
exceptional profit of £8 million (post-tax 
£5 million), comprising an impairment write 
back and a small loss on disposal. 
Centrica retains a 20% equity interest in the 
entity which owns and operates the eight 
nuclear stations in the UK. Our share of 
nuclear generation volumes remained high 
at 12.8TWh, the second highest output 
achieved since our investment in 2009. 
However, this was 2% lower than in 2016, 
reflecting slightly higher unplanned outages.
Central Power Generation adjusted 
operating profit was £35 million, 53% lower 
than 2016. This was primarily driven by 
a lower achieved power price for Nuclear, 
including the impact of historic hedging, 
and the impact of our exit from wind power 
generation. Adjusted operating cash flow 
was £58 million compared to an outflow of 
£1 million in 2016, with positive movements 
in working capital in comparison to 2016, 
more than offsetting a reduction in Nuclear 
dividends received.
Centrica plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 | 45 Exploration & Production
In line with our strategy, we now have 
a stronger, more sustainable Exploration 
& Production (E&P) business focused 
on Europe.  
Following the disposal of our assets in 
Canada and Trinidad and Tobago during 
the year, on 8 December Spirit Energy was 
launched, a newly formed entity combining 
Centrica’s E&P business with that of 
Bayerngas Norge. The transaction creates 
a leading independent European E&P 
business with an attractive mix of producing 
assets and development projects. Centrica 
owns 69% of the new business, and will 
consolidate 100% of the financial result.
The sale of our remaining portfolio of 
gas assets in Trinidad and Tobago was 
completed in May for $35 million (£26 million), 
which resulted in a pre- and post-tax 
exceptional loss on disposal of £9 million. 
We announced the disposal of our interest 
in the joint venture portfolio of assets in 
Canada in June, and the sale was completed 
in September for C$420 million (£255 million), 
leading to total pre-tax exceptional loss on 
disposal and impairment charges of 
£125 million (post-tax £109 million). 
Total gas and liquids production of 
61.0mmboe was down 14% compared 
to 2016 principally due to the sale of assets 
in Canada and Trinidad and Tobago. 
Production in Europe was down 5%, 
or 6% when excluding Bayerngas Norge 
production following the launch of Spirit 
Energy. This principally reflects lower 
production from Morecambe due to our 
decision to undertake onshore and offshore 
asset integrity works to improve safety, 
operational efficiency and underpin the 
residual life of the asset. Excluding 
Morecambe, the natural decline from the rest 
of the portfolio was fully offset by the positive 
impact of a first full year of production from 
the Cygnus gas field, which came onstream 
in December 2016 and is performing ahead 
of expectations. 
We continue to focus our investment on the 
most attractive development options in our 
portfolio. Drilling operations at the Maria 
development commenced in the first quarter 
2017 , with first oil achieved in December, 
a year ahead of schedule and with total 
project costs around 20% lower than the 
business case. Further infill wells were drilled 
at Statfjord and Kvitebjørn in Norway and 
Chestnut in the UK. Overall, 2017 capital 
expenditure was down 15% to £439 million, 
which reflects the impact of reduced spend 
on Cygnus. 
In 2018, we currently expect Spirit Energy to 
deliver production in the range 50–55mmboe 
while progressing several key projects. 
Fabrication contracts have been awarded 
and drilling commenced on the Oda project, 
which remains on target to produce first oil in 
2019, while appraisal drilling will commence 
at the Fogelberg discovery. We also expect 
that a Field Development Plan for the Nova 
development, previously named Skarfjell, 
will be finalised during 2018. 
Reflecting the net impact of the Spirit Energy 
transaction, and reserve additions on a 
number of fields including Chiswick and 
Maria not fully offsetting production during 
the year, Centrica’s net share of 2P reserves 
in Europe, excluding reserves at Rough, fell by 
59mmboe to 251mmboe at the end of 2017 .
European total lifting and other cash 
production costs increased by 9% 
compared to 2016, with the decline in 
sterling and the impact of Cygnus coming 
on-stream more than offsetting cost 
efficiency benefits. Combined with lower 
production volumes, this resulted in 
European unit lifting and other cash 
production costs increasing by 16%. For the 
period in which the assets in Canada and 
Trinidad and Tobago were owned, Americas 
unit lifting and other cash production costs 
were 47% higher, principally reflecting the 
impact of the decline in sterling, higher 
royalty and pipeline tariffs and the non-
repeat of some one-off savings in 2016.
Adjusted operating profit of £184 million was 
broadly flat compared to 2016, with higher 
achieved prices offsetting the impact 
of lower production, higher cash costs 
and higher depreciation including that 
associated with Cygnus production. 
Adjusted operating cash flow fell 32% to 
£448 million despite the flat operating profit, 
reflecting higher decommissioning spend 
and higher cash taxes due to the phasing 
of Norwegian payments between years. 
The business was again free cash flow 
positive in 2017 , generating £298 million 
when excluding £78 million of cash acquired 
Business Review (continued)
Strategic Report | Business Review
46 | Centrica plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 through the Spirit Energy transaction. This 
includes £289 million of disposal proceeds, 
with adjusted operating cash flow broadly 
offsetting capital expenditure during the year. 
We also recognised pre-tax exceptional 
impairments of £494 million (post-tax 
£162 million) on certain fields, predominantly 
due to reduction in price forecasts and 
changes to expected decommissioning 
costs following the conclusion of the triennial 
review, partially offset by the recognition of 
a PRT deferred tax asset reversing a prior 
period impairment. In addition, there has 
been a pre-tax reduction in decommissioning 
provisions of £86 million (post-tax £51 million) 
for assets previously impaired through 
exceptional items.
Centrica Storage
In January 2018, Centrica Storage (CSL) 
received consent from the Oil and Gas 
Authority to produce all recoverable gas 
reserves from the Rough asset which, 
following the Competition and Markets 
Authority’s final decision to remove CSL 
from the Undertakings, finalises the change 
in Rough’s status from a storage facility to 
a producing asset.
In June, CSL announced it had completed 
and analysed the results of the extensive well 
testing programme at the Rough gas storage 
asset, which had commenced in 2015 
following the identification of an issue with 
the integrity of the wells. 
CSL also announced that it had completed 
a review into the feasibility of returning 
Rough to injection and storage operations. 
It concluded that due to the high operating 
pressures involved, and the fact that the 
wells and facilities are at the end of their 
design life and had suffered a number of 
different failure modes while testing, it could 
not safely return the assets and facilities to 
injection and storage operations. In addition, 
an assessment of both the current 
economics of seasonal storage and the 
costs involved suggested that it would not 
be economic to continue to operate Rough 
as a gas storage asset by refurbishing or 
rebuilding the facility and replacing the wells.
As a result, CSL made all relevant 
applications to permanently end Rough’s 
status as a storage facility and to produce 
all recoverable gas reserves. In December, 
the Competition and Markets Authority 
announced its final decision to grant CSL ’s 
request to be released from the Rough 
Undertakings, while in January 2018 the 
Oil and Gas Authority (OGA) granted its 
consent for CSL to produce indigenous gas 
and associated liquids from Rough. Separate 
to this application, in June, CSL also applied 
to the OGA to produce up to an initial 30.7bcf 
of gas in order to reduce pressure on the 
wells to ensure that risks associated with 
operating the reservoir are as low as 
reasonably practical. Consent was granted 
in September, and 25bcf of gas was sold in 
2017 , with production continuing into 2018. 
CSL will now operate Rough as a gas 
production asset to maximise recovery of 
the estimated 142bcf of reserves remaining 
in the field as at the end of 2017 . Production 
in 2018 is currently forecast to be 56bcf. 
CSL gross revenue increased by 59% 
to £148 million, reflecting 2017 production 
volumes from the Rough asset being 
materially higher than the 9bcf of cushion 
gas sold in 2016. This was partially offset 
by minimal SBU revenue due to the reduced 
available capacity of the reservoir for the 
2016/17 storage year as a result of the well 
integrity issues and no SBUs being sold for 
the 2017/18 storage year. With total costs 
down 9% due to lower fuel gas usage 
reflecting the reduced operations at 
Rough and reduced operating costs to 
reflect the changing status of the asset, CSL 
recognised an adjusted operating profit of 
£17 million in 2017 compared to a loss of 
£52 million in 2016. Adjusted operating cash 
flow was £61 million, which included working 
capital inflows resulting from the sale of 
operational stock, compared to a build-up 
of stock in 2016, and costs associated with 
decommissioning the 8A platform, which 
will continue into 2018.
A pre-tax exceptional charge of £270 million 
(post-tax £224 million) was recorded in the 
first half of 2017 , following the June 2017 
announcement to apply for a production 
licence and permanently end Rough’s status 
as a storage facility. From 2018, we expect 
to report both Spirit Energy and CSL in one 
E&P reporting segment.

48 | Centrica plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Operating profit
Throughout this report, reference is made 
to a number of different profit measures, 
as shown below.
Total adjusted operating profit reduced 
17% to £1,252 million (2016: £1,515 million). 
Centrica Consumer profit fell 1% with the 
impact of warmer weather on consumption 
and lower account holdings in UK Home and 
North America Home, and an increased 
operating loss due to growth investment in 
Connected Home, largely offset by cost 
efficiencies. Centrica Business profit fell by 
67%, largely reflecting the impact of warmer 
weather and competitive market conditions 
in our energy supply businesses in UK 
Business and North America Business, 
a one-off non-cash charge relating to a 
reassessment of the historic recognition of 
unbilled power revenues in North America 
and lower profit from flexible gas contracts 
in Energy Marketing and Trading (EM&T). 
Profit from E&P was broadly flat, with higher 
achieved prices offsetting lower volumes, 
while CSL reported an operating profit of 
£17 million compared to a loss of £52 million 
in 2016, reflecting higher gas production 
volumes with Rough having received 
permission to produce up to 30.7bcf of 
cushion gas to reduce pressure in the field 
for safety reasons.
Group finance charge and tax
Net finance costs increased to £344 million 
(2016: £300 million), predominantly reflecting 
a lower capitalised interest credit. 
Business performance taxation on profit 
was lower at £191 million (2016: £282 million) 
and after taking account of tax on joint 
ventures and associates, the adjusted tax 
charge was £197 million (2016: £298 million). 
An adjusted effective tax rate calculation is 
shown on page 50.
The Group adjusted effective tax rate reduced 
to 22% (2016: 25%) reflecting the mix of 
profits between different activities and 
jurisdictions and the impact of a net uncertain 
tax provision release of £34 million, a net 
petroleum revenue tax refund of £34 million 
and a tax credit of £34 million resulting from 
the restatement of deferred tax balances 
following the reduction in the US federal 
tax rate from 35% to 21%. Adjusting for these 
impacts and other similar, but individually 
immaterial items, the Group’s underlying 
adjusted effective tax rate was 40%.

Centrica plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 | 49 For the European E&P activities, now 
included within Spirit Energy, profits were 
made in Norway but losses were incurred in 
the UK, where tax relief is given at a lower 
effective rate than the rate applied in Norway. 
As a result, the Spirit Energy underlying 
adjusted effective tax rate was 143%. 
The future underlying effective tax rate for 
Spirit Energy will be dependent on the mix 
of profits, while the underlying adjusted 
effective tax rate for UK operations is 
expected to reduce in future years as the UK 
corporation tax rate reduces to 17% from 
2020. The underlying adjusted effective tax 
rate for US operations reported within non-
UK is also expected to reduce reflecting the 
reduction in the US federal tax rate to 21%.
Group earnings and dividends
Profit for the year from business performance 
decreased to £710 million (2016: £885 million) 
and after adjusting for non-controlling 
interests, adjusted earnings fell by 22% to 
£698 million (2016: £895 million). This reflects 
the lower adjusted operating profit and 
higher net finance cost, partly offset by the 
lower tax charge, all as described above. 
Adjusted basic EPS was 12.6 pence 
(2016: 16.8 pence) reflecting the lower 
earnings and a higher number of shares 
in issue due to the effects of a 7% equity 
placing in May 2016 and the scrip dividend.
The statutory profit attributable to 
shareholders for the year was £333 million 
(2016: £1,672 million). The reconciling items 
between Group profit for the period from 
business performance and statutory profit 
are related to exceptional items and certain 
re-measurements. The difference compared 
to 2016 is principally due to a post-tax 
exceptional charge of £476 million (2016: 
credit of £27 million) and a lower net gain from 
certain re-measurements of £69 million (2016: 
£750 million). The Group reported a statutory 
basic EPS of 6.0 pence (2016: 31.4 pence).
In addition to the interim dividend of 3.6 pence 
per share, the proposed final dividend is  
8.4 pence, giving a total full year dividend  
of 12.0 pence (2016: 12.0 pence). 
Group cash flow, net debt and  
balance sheet
Net cash flow from operating activities 
decreased to £1,840 million (2016: £2,396 
million), which predominantly reflects lower 
EBITDA and net working capital inflows. 
Adjusted operating cash flow, which is 
reconciled to net cash flow from operating 
activities in the table on page 51, was down 
23% to £2,069 million. 
Net cash inflow from investing activities was 
£32 million (2016: outflow of £803 million). 
The change compared to 2016 is 
predominantly due to proceeds from net 
disposals in 2017 of £819 million, mainly 
relating to the Lincs Wind Farm, UK gas fired 
power stations and Canadian E&P assets. 
The 2016 comparator included the 
acquisitions of ENER-G Cogen and Neas 
Energy and lower disposal proceeds. 
Net cash outflow from financing activities 
was £1,070 million (2016: £546 million). This 
predominantly reflects 2016 including an 
inflow from the issuance of ordinary share 
capital following the £700 million equity 
placing. Equity dividends paid were lower in 
2017 , reflecting a higher scrip take up of the 
2016 final dividend payment, financing interest 
was higher and repayment of borrowings 
were lower reflecting a lower level of debt 
maturing in 2017 compared to 2016.
Reflecting all of the above, the Group’s 
net debt as at 31 December 2017 fell 
to £2,596 million (31 December 2016: 
£3,473 million), which includes cash collateral 
posted or received in support of wholesale 
energy procurement. 
Net assets increased by £584 million to 
£3,428 million (31 December 2016: 
£2,844 million). Total assets decreased by 
£1,226 million, with lower non-current assets 
predominantly reflecting the pre-tax impact 
of impairments and disposals. Total liabilities 
decreased by £1,810 million, including the 
impact of lower decommissioning provisions 
resulting from the E&P disposals, lower 
derivative financial instrument balances, and 
a reduction in the net pension liability from 
£1,137 million at the end of 2016 to 
£886 million at the end of 2017 . Further 
details on pensions can be found in note 22.

Group Financial Review (continued)  2017 Acquisitions and disposals
In line with its strategy to reduce its scale 
in E&P and Central Power Generation, in 
February the Group completed the disposal 
of the Lincs Wind Farm for £214 million and in 
May completed the disposal of its remaining 
Trinidad and Tobago gas assets for 
£26 million. In August, the Group completed 
the disposal of its UK gas fired power 
stations at Langage, South Humber Bank 
and Kings Lynn B, for £314 million and in 
September, the Group completed the 
disposal of its 60% interest in its portfolio 
of Canadian E&P assets for £255 million. 
In November, the Group acquired Europe’s 
leading demand response aggregator, 
REstore, for £62 million. The business brings 
key capabilities in asset optimisation and 
demand response aggregation is expected 
to become a core part of our distributed 
energy offer to customers. The business 
will form part of the DE&P business unit. 
In December, Spirit Energy was formed, 
combining the Group’s remaining European 
E&P business with that of Bayerngas Norge 
AS. The Group owns 69% of the business. 
Further details on acquisitions, assets 
purchased and disposals are included in 
notes 4(e) and 12.
Exceptional items
A net exceptional pre-tax charge of 
£884 million was recognised in 2017 
(2016: £11 million).
The Group recognised net impairments of 
£408 million on E&P assets. It recognised 
£494 million of impairments predominantly 
due to a reduction in price forecasts and 
changes to decommissioning costs following 
the conclusion of the triennial review. It also 
recognised an £86 million write-back of 
decommissioning provisions for assets 
previously impaired.
Following the announcement in June 2017 
that the Rough facility could not be safely 
returned to injection and storage operations 
and CSL would instead apply for a 
production licence for the remaining cushion 
gas, a pre-tax impairment charge of 
£270 million was recorded in the half 
year results. 
The Group recognised a £64 million gain on 
disposal of the Lincs Wind Farm joint venture 
and a net gain of £8 million relating to the 
disposal of its CCGT power stations. 
The Group recognised a £9 million loss on 
disposal of its remaining portfolio of gas 
assets in Trinidad and Tobago and a total 
net charge of £125 million relating to the 
disposal of its Canadian E&P assets. 
As a result of the Group’s strategic review 
announced in 2015, the Group incurred 
a further £144 million of restructuring and 
business change costs in 2017 in 
implementing the new organisational model 
relating principally to redundancy costs, 
impairment of assets on closure of 
businesses, transformation spend and 
consultancy costs, as well as costs 
associated with setting up the Spirit Energy 
business and changing the operating model 
for CSL. 
These charges generated a taxation credit 
of £408 million (2016: £38 million). Total net 
exceptional charges after taxation were 
£476 million (2016: credit of £27 million).
Further details can be found in note 7 .
Certain re-measurements
The Group enters into a number of forward 
energy trades to protect and optimise 
the value of its underlying production, 
generation, storage and transportation 
assets (and similar capacity or off-take 
contracts), as well as to meet the future 
needs of our customers. A number of 
these arrangements are considered to be 
derivative financial instruments and are 
required to be fair valued under IAS 39. The 
Group has shown the fair value adjustments 
on these commodity derivative trades 
separately as certain re-measurements, 
as they do not reflect the underlying 
performance of the business because they 
are economically related to our upstream 
assets, capacity/off-take contracts or 
downstream demand, which are typically 
not fair valued. The operating profit in the 
statutory results includes a net pre-tax gain 
of £125 million (2016: £1,030 million) relating 
to these re-measurements, or £69 million 
after tax (2016: £750 million). The Group 
recognises the realised gains and losses on 
these contracts in business performance 
when the underlying transaction occurs. The 
profits arising from the physical purchase 
and sale of commodities during the year, 
which reflect the prices in the underlying 
contracts, are not impacted by these re-
measurements. See note 7 for further details.
Events after the balance sheet
On 15 January 2018, Centrica Storage 
was granted consent from the Oil and Gas 
Authority to produce indigenous gas and 
associated liquids from Rough, confirming 
transition from a storage operation to one 
of production on 17 January 2018.
Further details of events after the balance 
sheet date are described in note 26.
Risk and capital management
The Group’s principal risks and uncertainties 
are set out on pages 52 to 62. Details of 
how the Group has managed financial risks 
such as liquidity and credit risk are set out 
in note S3. Details on the Group’s capital 
management processes are provided under 
sources of finance in note 24(a).
Accounting policies
UK listed companies are required to 
comply with the European regulation to 
report consolidated financial statements 
in conformity with International Financial 
Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by 
the European Union. The Group’s specific 
accounting measures, including changes 
of accounting presentation and selected 
key sources of estimation uncertainty, are 
explained in notes 1, 2 and 3.

Centrica plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 | 51 Understanding those Risks that 
impact our Strategy
The fundamental trends outlined in our 
strategy on pages 10 and 11, including the 
decentralisation of energy systems, shift 
of power to consumers and increasing 
digitisation, present both opportunities 
and threats. Identifying and managing 
these risks is critical to delivering our 
strategy. The Group Priorities, as laid out 
below, are the lens through which we 
assess our risks and drive discussions 
around the level of risk we need to take 
and the requirements of our System of 
Risk Management and Internal Control.
Strengthening our System of Risk 
Management and Internal Control
Following our Strategic Review in 2015, 
we refreshed our approach to risk 
management. In 2017 we focused on 
embedding this improved process aligned 
with the new operating model to ensure 
it makes a positive contribution to effective 
decision-making and business growth, 
while ensuring we successfully manage 
risks. In particular, as we have moved into 
new geographies, we have sought to ensure 
we are addressing risks associated with 
operating in those jurisdictions. 
Each business unit and Group function is 
responsible for identifying and assessing 
its significant risks within the context of 
our Principal Risks. For each risk, they 
consider both the potential impact to the 
Group and the likelihood of occurrence on 
an inherent and residual basis. The Executive 
Committee then considers these perspectives 
alongside broader external and internal factors 
to create a Group-wide set of prioritised risks. 
• We categorise our risks as:
 – Risk Requiring Standards (RRS): 
Risk with negative impacts that 
we control through Standards and 
Management Systems, for example 
process safety or data security.
 – Risk Requiring Judgement (RRJ): 
Risk that we choose to take in order 
to execute our business strategy, 
for example new products or business 
improvement opportunities. 
 – External Risk: Risk that requires 
a focus on scenario and contingency 
planning with little or no ability to 
reduce likelihood, for example extreme 
weather or geopolitical turbulence.
On an annual basis, we evaluate our System 
of Risk Management and Internal Control, 
learning from any control incidents that have 
arisen, to ensure we are mitigating risks in 
line with our risk appetite.

52 | Centrica plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Evaluating Risks through our Enterprise Risk Framework
Our Enterprise Risk Framework is designed to enable us to identify, evaluate 
and mitigate our risks appropriately. It comprises six steps:
2 Assess & Analyse
• Assess inherent impact and likelihood using 
Centrica risk assessment matrix
• Identify risk type (RRS, RRJ or External Risk) 
and determine target risk rating
• Identify mitigating activity and key risk 
indicators and assess current risk exposure
5 Calibrate & Assure
• Group Functions calibrate submitted risks to ensure 
consistency and prioritise their responses
• Functional assurance and internal audit activity
• Assess impact of assurance findings
3 Design & Implement Controls
• Design and implement controls 
and actions to mitigate the potential 
impact and likelihood of risks
6 Report, Evaluate & Improve
• Report consolidated risk, assurance and control position 
to the Group Risk, Assurance and Control Committee, 
Audit Committee and Safety, Health, Environment, Security 
and Ethics Committee 
• Evaluate priority risks within the Group risk profile to identify 
any corrective actions 
• Evaluate Group-wide severe, but plausible risks 
and implications 
• Drive continuous improvement through reviewing the 
Risk Universe and Group risk appetite
1 Identify
•  Identify significant risks to achieving 
business unit and/or function objectives
4 Manage & Monitor
• Management of risks and controls 
to deliver target risk level
• Monitor through inspection, 
performance reviews and 
regular reporting
• Identify and implement specific 
remediation actions
Determining the risk we would like 
to take
The Board approves statements of risk 
appetite associated with each Group Priority. 
These statements provide a framework to 
guide our risk mitigation activities and to 
drive the appropriate level of risk taking: 
• Safety, compliance and conduct: Our 
appetite for taking risk in this area is as 
low as reasonably practicable in relation 
to: ensuring the safety of our people, 
customers and communities; conducting 
our business operations in compliance 
with laws and regulations; and managing 
our financial reporting risks.
• Customer satisfaction and 
operational excellence: We have a 
moderate risk appetite to allow us to 
pursue innovative opportunities. We are 
driven to satisfy the changing needs of 
our customers. 
• Cash flow growth and strategic 
momentum: We have a moderate 
to high risk appetite for seeking 
opportunities to deliver cash flow growth 
and our target return on capital. 
• Cost efficiency and simplification: 
We have a low risk appetite for 
failing to implement and manage 
improvements sustainably and 
in a rigorous and systematic way. 
• People and building capability: 
We accept a moderate level of risk 
in finding ways to attract, develop 
and reward people with the diverse 
capabilities needed to deliver our 
ambitions. However, we have a low 
risk appetite for rewarding and 
retaining people who fail to demonstrate 
our Values.

Mitigating risks through the 
System of Risk Management and 
Internal Control
Risk management is a key pillar of the overall 
governance and management framework for 
the Group. Our System of Risk Management 
and Internal Control comprises the following 
elements that are assessed annually for 
effectiveness:
• What we stand for:
 – Our Purpose: We are an energy and 
services company. Everything we do 
is focused on satisfying the changing 
needs of our customers.
 – Our Values: The new values were 
rolled out globally in September 2017 
to underpin our strategy and Priorities.
 – Our Code: This was launched in early 
2018 to replace our Business Principles 
and provides the foundation for how 
we operate. 
• Our strategic framework:
 – Strategy: Set out in July 2015 and 
aligned throughout the organisation 
by the five Group Priorities.
 – Financial framework: Sets out 
parameters and targets within which 
we operate to guide our strategic 
planning and financial decision-making.
 – Enterprise Risk Framework: 
Incorporates the Principal Risks within 
the Group Risk Universe, as outlined 
on pages 55 to 60.
• Our governance:
 – Board and Committees: Structured 
to effectively dispense with required 
duties and through which our Principal 
Risks are monitored.
 – Legal entities: Subsidiary company 
legal entities with Boards of Directors 
required to meet legal and regulatory 
obligations.
 – Delegations of Authority: 
Accountability is delegated through 
the organisation to individuals in 
accordance with risk appetite.
 – Executive and Committees: 
Oversight to ensure appropriate 
planning and performance 
management.
• How we are organised and managed:
 – Management Systems: The detailed 
policies, standards and processes 
establishing the mandatory 
requirements and which are required 
for the systematic management of 
related risks.
• How we provide assurance:
 – Functional assurance: Ensuring 
policies and standards are complied 
with through monitoring and testing 
activities performed by individuals 
who are not directly responsible for 
the operation of the controls. 
 – Internal Audit: Providing confidence 
to the Board, via the Audit Committee, 
that Centrica has appropriate 
risk management procedures and 
effective controls in place.
 – External assurance: Auditing of the 
Group’s Annual Report and Accounts 
prior to reporting, which includes 
assessment of internal controls 
relevant to financial reporting. 
Our System of Risk Management and Internal Control
The vision behind 
our Enterprise Risk 
Framework was to enable 
us to operate within an 
acceptable risk envelope 
and make risk-informed 
decisions in pursuit of our 
strategy. Identification 
and management of risk 
is part of the day-to-day 
responsibility of all our 
staff and a feature of all 
our business activities.

Our Principal Risks and Uncertainties (continued)
Strategic Report | Our Principal Risks and Uncertainties
54 | Centrica plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Principal Risks
The Group Risk Universe is made up of a holistic framework of Principal Risks, 
laid out below. The Board makes a robust assessment of these Principal Risks, 
considering future performance and our ability to deliver the strategy, including 
solvency and liquidity risks. For each Principal Risk, we discuss the nature of the 
risk, the risk climate and the impact on our Group Priorities. Each Principal Risk is 
overseen directly by the Board or one of its Committees, with the Board retaining 
overall responsibility for risk across the Group.
Description Potential impacts Mitigation
1 Political and Regulatory Intervention
Risk of political or regulatory intervention such 
as the adoption of blanket price caps in the UK 
energy supply market, changes to the political 
or regulatory landscape, or failure to influence 
that change.
Changes in government 
and regulatory oversight, 
specifically relating to the 
Consumer Divisions markets 
in the UK and North America, 
such as the developments in 
UK market regulation during 
2017 , could erode our profit 
margins through price caps, or 
through additional obligations 
that increase operating costs. 
The UK’s decision to exit the 
European Union and wider 
political changes in the markets 
we operate in present risks 
relating to changing policies in 
relation to the energy market 
change and carbon emissions.
• We are active in contributing our views on the development 
of the markets in which we operate and in discussions with 
political parties, regulatory authorities and other influencers. 
• We are committed to an open, transparent and 
competitive UK energy market that provides choice for 
consumers. In November, we announced seven unilateral 
steps we would take and recommended a series of 
broader market reforms (as detailed on page 18). 
• The UK is due to exit the European Union within two years 
of Article 50 being triggered in March 2017 . We have 
a dedicated Brexit project group which is working to 
understand and assess the many Brexit-related issues 
which could impact the Group and our customers. 
• We accept that we may be the subject of regulatory 
scrutiny that could result in stakeholder concerns. We 
co-operate fully with any enquiry or investigation and 
take measures to react as quickly as possible.

2 Financial Market
Risk of financial loss due to our exposure to 
market movements, including commodity 
prices, inflation, interest rates and currency 
fluctuations. 
Our exposure to adverse price 
movements in commodity 
markets, due to our large 
upstream and downstream 
positions, could impact 
profitability and cash flow 
generation across the business. 
Financial market risk is taken on 
by Energy Marketing & Trading 
(EM&T) as part of the 
proprietary trading business. 
Increased volatility in 
commodity prices could 
provide more opportunities but 
also give rise to higher collateral 
costs and/or additional credit 
risk for both EM&T and North 
America Business.
• We have hedging strategies in place to mitigate exposure 
to commodity and financial market volatility.
• Financial risk is reviewed regularly by the Group Finance 
Function and the Group Risk, Assurance and Control 
Committee to assess financial exposures and compliance 
with risk limits. Regular review is also undertaken by the 
Audit Committee.
• As we move into new trading arrangements, including the 
continued expansion of our LNG business, we are focused 
on ensuring that our financial risk policies remain appropriate 
to the risks we face. 
• Our business units have risk measures, policies and 
monitoring commensurate with the activities and risks that 
they manage, and we invest in our systems to further 
automate our control environment.

3 Health, Safety, Environment 
and Security (HSES)
Risk of failure to protect the health, safety and 
security of customers, employees and third 
parties or to take appropriate measures to 
protect our environment and in response to 
climate change.
Our operations have the 
potential to result in personal 
or environmental harm, or 
operational loss. Significant 
HSES events could also have 
regulatory, legal, financial and 
reputational impacts that would 
adversely affect some or all of 
our brands and businesses.
• We undertake regular reviews and have assurance 
processes in place with reporting to the HSES Committee 
on a quarterly basis and full discussion of all issues arising. 
• The HSES management system is used to manage our 
controls, focusing on areas of concern including process 
safety, driving and working at heights. 
• We continue to invest in training to ensure we maintain safe 
operating practices. During 2017 all senior leaders took 
part in an HSES leadership event. 
• Security intelligence and operating procedures, as well as 
crisis management and business continuity plans, are 
regularly evaluated and tested. 
• Significant Centrica representation on Board Committees 
and establishment of a Shareholder Office to ensure that 
mitigation of HSES risks remains a priority within the new 
joint venture organisation, Spirit Energy. 
• We actively engage with climate change bodies and 
NGOs to offer our perspective, understand the direction 
of potential future actions, and assess our readiness to 
manage through change. 
• A description of how we manage our environmental risk 
is described on page 36.

4 Strategy Delivery
Risk that we do not deliver our strategy due to 
insufficient capability to execute it in line with 
plan or failure to adapt quickly enough to 
respond to changes in the external 
environment. In our bottom-up process of risk 
reporting, this is a key area of focus for our 
business units and functions.
Successful delivery of our 
strategy requires delivering the 
energy and services our 
customers desire in a way that 
satisfies their needs in a 
competitive market place. 
Failure to identify changing 
trends in customers’ needs, 
adapt to changing market and 
competitive environments, 
deliver major transformation 
programmes to be an efficient 
supplier, and build the 
necessary capabilities to 
compete, have the potential to 
impact our cash flow growth 
and value creation goals.
• The Board sets and approves the Group’s strategy, 
setting the strategic direction and confirming the 
strategic choices made by the business. Regular reviews 
are conducted on changes in market trends and the 
competitive environment, and the business response.
• We have a clear financial framework to ensure capital 
is allocated in line with the strategy and that balance 
sheet strength and return on capital boundary conditions 
are met. 
• The Board and Executive Committee regularly review 
the capabilities required to deliver on the strategy and 
address gaps as they arise.

5 External Market Environment
Risk that events in the external market or 
environment could affect the delivery of 
our strategy.
We operate in highly 
competitive and changing 
markets, where customer 
behaviour, needs and 
demands are evolving due to 
digitisation, energy efficiency, 
climate change, government 
initiatives, and the general 
economic outlook. In addition, 
we are subject to global market 
volatility in our upstream 
businesses in commodity 
markets.
• We focus on understanding customer segments and 
their needs, aiming to design products and offerings that 
are attractive and competitive. 
• We are increasing our investment in areas like Connected 
Home and Distributed Energy & Power that represent 
emerging customer needs and reinforce our existing 
energy supply and services offerings, putting customers 
more in control of their energy use as described on 
page 33.
• Regular analysis is undertaken of commodity price 
fundamentals and their potential impact on our business 
plans and forecasts.

6 Brand, Trust and Reputation
Risk that our competitive position is 
compromised by poor standards of fairness 
and transparency and by failing to protect our 
brands.
Failure to appropriately manage 
brand perception, media 
attention and campaign or 
pressure groups could have a 
negative impact on consumer 
sentiment and contribute to a 
fall in overall customer 
numbers. 
Failure to be fair and 
transparent in all our operations 
could cause reputational 
damage and if standards are 
particularly low, lead to legal 
action.
• We regularly monitor and review our level of customer 
service, aiming to deliver a fair, simplified and transparent 
offering to all of our consumers. Operational processes 
are in place to address failure in service and customer 
complaints. 
• We engage with NGOs, consumer and customer 
groups, political parties, regulators, charities and other 
stakeholders to identify solutions to help reduce bills 
and improve trust in the industry. 
• We review and monitor changes in our customer brand 
position through net promoter score (NPS) and other 
metrics as described on page 31. 
• We consider our impact on society as part of being 
a good corporate citizen. This is set out in the Building 
strong communities section on pages 37 to 38.

7 Change Management
Risk of failure in the identification, alignment and 
execution of change programmes and business 
restructuring.
If change projects are not 
aligned to strategic objectives 
or not implemented 
appropriately, the expected 
benefits may not be realised. 
If acquisitions are not integrated 
effectively the business 
benefits may not be realised.
• Significant change management programmes are 
reviewed as a regular aspect of Group and business unit 
performance reviews, and are regular agenda items of 
Executive Committee meetings.
• Change activity is managed through a network of 
programme offices providing oversight and governance 
at the appropriate level. 
• We have dedicated change capability at Group and 
business unit level to monitor the realisation of benefits, 
the prioritisation of efforts and to share best practice. 
• Our people capability is continually reviewed and 
developed to ensure we have the right skills to deliver 
our plans.
• We have post-merger integration guidelines in place to 
integrate acquired businesses.

8 Legal, Regulatory and Ethical 
Standards Compliance
Risk of failure to comply with laws and 
regulations and behave ethically in line with Our 
Code, resulting in reputational or financial 
damage. This includes market conduct, 
customer conduct, data protection and financial 
crime risk.
Our operations are the subject 
of intense regulatory focus and 
we seek to deliver the highest 
standards in compliance. We 
recognise that any real or 
perceived failure to follow Our 
Code or comply with legal or 
regulatory obligations would 
undermine trust in our 
business. Non-compliance 
could also result in fines, 
penalties or other interventions.
• Regulatory compliance monitoring activities are 
performed by a single Group-wide function to drive 
consistency and quality. 
• Control frameworks are in place in the UK and in 
development in other markets to ensure that the 
customer experience is delivered in line with our 
Customer Conduct guidelines. This is managed through 
a Group-wide practice group. 
• The Market Conduct practice group shares best practice 
with standardised controls and processes and aligns 
mitigation activities where possible. 
• Data is a strategic asset and its protection is a priority 
under a Steering Group led by the Executive Director, 
Centrica Consumer. 
• Our Code was launched globally in January 2018 to 
underpin the new values introduced in 2017 . This sets the 
standard for behaviour across the Group. 
• Where we enter new territories via acquisition or organic 
growth we ensure country risks are identified and 
managed appropriately, including anti-bribery and 
corruption risk and compliance with local legislation.

9 Asset Development, Availability 
and Performance
Risk that failures in the development or integrity 
of our investments in operated and non-
operated assets could compromise 
performance delivery.
Failure to invest in the 
maintenance and development 
of our assets could result in 
significant safety issues or 
asset underperformance. 
Operational integrity is critical 
to our ability to deliver 
performance in line with the 
strategic objectives. 
• Capital allocation and investment decisions are governed 
through the Investment Committee, the final decision 
resting with the Group Chief Executive and/or Board 
of Directors. 
• Group-wide minimum standards are applied to all assets, 
whether operated or non-operated to give confidence in 
their integrity. 
• Maintenance activity and improvement programmes are 
conducted in all asset-based businesses to maximise 
effectiveness and production levels.

10 Information Systems and Security
Risk of reduced effectiveness, availability, 
integrity or security of IT systems and data 
essential for Centrica’s operations.
Our substantial customer base 
and strategic requirement to be 
at the forefront of technology 
development, means that it 
is critical our technology is 
robust, our systems are secure 
and our data protected. 
Sensitive data faces the threat 
of misappropriation, leading 
to potential financial loss 
and/or reputational damage 
to the Group. 
Failure to deliver IT solutions 
in support of the prioritised 
objectives and change 
programmes in the business 
would have consequences 
both for our organisational 
transformation and in some 
cases, our compliance 
obligations.
• Our information security strategy seeks to integrate 
information systems, personnel and physical aspects 
in order to prevent, detect and investigate threats 
and incidents. 
• We engage with key technology partners and suppliers, 
to ensure potentially vulnerable systems are identified. 
• Regular controls testing and security patching around 
our core systems is undertaken and our controls are 
further tested periodically by outside experts.
• Strengthening of the Chief Information Security Officer 
(CISO) role to oversee the development of standards, 
controls and assurance across the Centrica estate. 
• We regularly evaluate the adequacy of our infrastructure 
and IT security controls, undertake employee awareness 
and training and test our contingency and recovery 
processes, recognising the evolving nature and pace of 
the threat landscape. 
• Established governance bodies to oversee plans to 
comply with new requirements including the European 
General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).

11 Financial Processing and Reporting
Risk of errors or losses arising from the 
processing and reporting of financial 
transactions for internal and external purposes. 
This includes potential errors such as the 
reassessment of unbilled power revenues in our 
North America Business Unit of £46 million, 
reported in our November 2017 trading update.
The increasingly complex 
financial accounting landscape, 
including new financial 
reporting standards, increases 
the likelihood of errors being 
made in the application of 
accounting judgements. 
The potential for failures in core 
controls around critical 
processes increases in a 
period of significant change. 
As Finance continues to 
implement the functional 
transformation programme, 
the risk of control degradation 
could increase and this is an 
area of significant focus.
• Our financial control framework incorporates our financial 
controls and management self-assessment compliance, 
with progress being made to improve the use of systems 
and reduce the reliance on manual controls. 
• We have implemented a revised balance sheet review 
and reconciliation procedure to target minimising control 
gaps arising in our underlying systems and ensure that 
issues are detected on a timely basis. 
• We undertake detailed testing and evaluation of the 
effectiveness of our controls in response to critical 
financial risks and report to the Financial Risk, Assurance 
and Control Committee quarterly.
• Controls improvement is a key objective of the Finance 
transformation programme, with oversight of delivery of 
this objective provided by the Audit Committee.

12 Business Planning, Forecasting 
and Performance Management
Risk that plans and forecasts may not be 
deliverable or may fail to drive efficient and 
effective performance and the risk of failures in 
performance reporting. This includes the risk 
that we do not quickly respond to and reflect 
performance management issues in any of 
the business units as and when they arise.
We prioritise how we use 
our resources based on our 
business plans and forecasts. 
Failure to accurately plan and 
forecast, taking into account 
the changing business 
environment, could result in 
sub-optimal decisions and 
failure to realise anticipated 
benefits.
• Annual planning processes are subject to scrutiny and 
challenge with respect to underlying market trends, 
competitive threats and organisational capability and 
delivery from the Executive Committee and the Board.
• Group Functions have adopted standardised planning 
processes in support of the business priorities, driving 
improved integration of plans. 
• Quarterly performance review meetings involving the 
Executive Committee enable the review of performance 
against forecasts, ensuring that mitigating actions or 
revisions are developed and implemented.

13 People
Risk that we cannot attract or retain employees 
to ensure we have the appropriate capabilities 
to deliver our strategy. There is also the potential 
risk of industrial action in our Consumer 
businesses.
In challenging conditions, it 
is critical that we attract and 
retain key capabilities across 
the business. The consequence 
of not being able to fulfil key 
roles could have a detrimental 
impact on our ability to meet 
our strategic objectives. 
The risk of industrial action in 
our businesses would have a 
potential impact on customer 
service levels and retention.
We require the right behaviours 
from our leaders and 
employees to deliver our 
business strategy in 
accordance with our Values 
and Our Code.
• We continue to evolve a clearly defined people strategy 
based on culture and engagement, equality and 
wellbeing, talent development, training and reward 
and recognition. 
• We regularly review organisational capability in critical 
business areas, reward strategies for key skills, talent 
management and learning and development 
programmes through external benchmarking. 
• We conduct an annual survey of employee engagement 
and take seriously the messages arising with a plan 
of actions.
• The Executive Committee has clear oversight through 
regular discussions of the people-related challenges 
inherent in our transformation programme. 
• We engage with trade unions on restructuring and issues 
that could impact terms and conditions with clear and 
open processes to promote an environment of trust 
and honesty.
• Our Code was launched in early 2018. This sets the 
expectations for all employees, replacing the 
Business Principles.

14 Customer Service
Risk of failure to consistently meet the 
expectations of our customers through the 
customer lifecycle.
The delivery of high quality 
customer service is central to 
our business strategy. With 
the entry of new competitors 
to the market, customers are 
increasingly likely to switch 
if they face an unacceptable 
customer experience. 
Remaining at the forefront of 
digital developments and 
innovating to provide choice 
and control for our customers 
is critical. This risk faces 
increased scrutiny as political 
and regulatory attention 
focuses on introducing 
competition by applying 
pressure over pricing 
strategies.
• Customer and Field Operations teams monitor 
customer service levels, ensuring enquiries are 
answered in a timescale and manner acceptable to 
the customer, complaint levels are minimised, and 
that customer satisfaction is reviewed at all stages 
of the customer journey.
• Leadership teams in our front-line businesses establish 
accountability for specific aspects of the customer 
journey and assess performance against agreed 
metrics weekly.
• Performance parameters are monitored on a weekly 
basis for all third-party service providers involved in the 
front-line and back office customer service process.
• Customer service agents are quality assessed for 
consistency with a rigorous training and performance 
management programme, and a structured performance 
management process is in place for field teams. 
• We operate an environment of continuous improvement, 
incorporating an accredited programme (STAR), and 
use root cause analysis of complaint and NPS insight to 
continuously improve our service delivery.

15 Balance Sheet Strength and 
Credit Position
Risk that the balance sheet may not be resilient 
with implications for our credit rating, liquidity 
risk and long-term financial obligations.
Failure to operate within the 
Group’s financial framework 
resulting in risk to maintaining 
our target credit rating, 
impacting our access to cost 
effective capital and trading 
arrangements. 
Long-term financial obligations 
may increase in value due to 
factors both inside and outside 
of our control, for example 
pension schemes, resulting 
in additional funding required 
to meet our obligations.
• We assess available resources on a regular basis and 
this analysis underpins our going concern assumption 
and viability analysis as described on pages 61 and 62.
• Significant committed facilities are maintained with 
sufficient cash held on deposit to meet working capital 
fluctuations as they arise. 
• Counterparty exposures are restricted through a Group 
Credit Limit policy which is regularly reviewed and 
adjusted as necessary. 
• Wholesale credit risks associated with commodity 
trading and treasury positions are managed in 
accordance with Group policy. 
• We consider accounting assumptions impacting on our 
balance sheet carefully, including decommissioning and 
impairment, as described as part of the Group Financial 
Review on pages 48 to 51 and in note 3(b) to the 
Financial Statements.

Management
Risk of failure to source responsibly and to co-

partners to ensure value delivery and continuity.
Our business operations rely on 
products and services provided 
through third parties, including 
outsourced activities, 
infrastructure and operating 
responsibility for some assets. 
We rely on these parties to 
comply not only with contractual 
terms, but also legal, regulatory 
and ethical business 
requirements.
• All suppliers are required to sign up to our ‘Ethical 
Procurement’ policies and procedures.
• Financial health, risk and anti-bribery and corruption due 
diligence and monitoring is implemented in supplier 
selection and contract renewal processes. 
• Audits are conducted in relation to third-party operation 
of jointly operated Exploration & Production assets. 
• We review the ethical conduct of our suppliers including 
a programme of supplier visits to provide additional 
assurance over practices employed, including respect 
for human rights, as part of being a good corporate 
citizen as laid out on page 38.
• Procurement practices have been reviewed across the 
Group and a global Procurement Policy and Standard 
was implemented from 1 January 2018.

Our Principal Risks and Uncertainties (continued)
Strategic Report | Our Principal Risks and Uncertainties
60 | Centrica plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Viability statement disclosure
In accordance with provision C.2.2 of the 
2016 UK Corporate Governance Code, 
the Directors have assessed the prospects 
for the Group over a significantly longer 
time period than the 12 months required 
in adopting the going concern basis 
of accounting.
In making this assessment the Directors take 
into account the liquidity analysis performed 
in relation to the Group’s net debt and 
available credit facilities, current business 
performance, the Group annual plan for 
2018 and strategic plan for the years beyond 
this, potential risks and uncertainties in the 
delivery of the strategic plan through a 
number of modelled scenarios and available 
mitigating actions. In conducting this 
analysis, we model all potential significant 
scenarios occurring simultaneously from the 
first year, causing the maximum potential 
impact on Group debt. 
Timeframe
The Board has reviewed the timeframe over 
which it makes this assessment and 
continues to believe that three years is the 
appropriate timeframe to assess viability. 
This conclusion is reached as a result of:
• alignment with detailed planning 
undertaken for a period of three years 
within the strategic planning process, 
which is used by the Group in assessing 
business performance and taking 
strategic decisions;
• the relatively short-term nature of some 
of our more significant risks, such as the 
potential for disruption in our customer-
facing markets, where we monitor the 
risks and available mitigations frequently;
• the commodity markets in which the 
Group operates where transparent and 
executable pricing is generally only 
available for a three-year period, allowing 
market-based information to be used 
within our forecasts for this period; and
• increasing uncertainty inherent in 
estimations beyond this period.
In assessing the prospects of the business, 
the Board must balance the short-term 
planning horizons in the customer-facing 
businesses, with the longer-term requirements 
of our more asset-intensive businesses. 
Given recent divestments of our largest 
power generation assets and the divestment 
of our wind portfolio, our core business is 
increasingly focused on the energy supply 
and services markets, which are more short 
term in orientation and outlook. Whilst we 
assess viability on a three-year basis, when 
we consider our strategic risks (as described 
on pages 55 to 60), we consider possibilities 
that may occur outside of this time period 
and any resultant mitigations.
Approach
The Board has outlined the Group strategy 
in detail on pages 10 to 11. The Group has 
a strong position in its chosen markets 
with established brands, a highly skilled 
customer-facing workforce and reliable 
operations. The main risks to delivery of the 
strategy, and our approach to managing 
these risks, are described in our approach 
to our Principal Risks on pages 55 to 60. 
To understand the impact of these risks the 
Directors perform a robust evaluation, which 
in turn informs the assessment of viability. 
In making this assessment, they consider 
severe, but plausible, impacts where the 
realisation of risks is more than remote in 
likelihood. The potential impact is based on 
known consequences, historical evidence 
and similar events observed in the market. 
The liquidity analysis contains assumptions 
relating to the key drivers of financial 
performance including customer numbers, 
fundamental trends in energy and services, 
commodity prices, efficiency programmes 
and the shape of the future portfolio.
We also model the impact on liquidity 
of events such as an inability to access 
uncommitted financing facilities or a market 
stress event, such as commodity price 
volatility or a two-notch credit rating 
downgrade. Identified risk impacts are 
then incorporated within scenarios that are 
modelled, individually and collectively, to 
assess the impact they have on the available 
headroom within our ongoing liquidity 
analysis. The scenarios assessed as being of 
most significance in making the assessment 
of viability (and the related primary Principal 
Risk categories) include:
• the potential for further regulatory or 
political intervention resulting in a 
significant impact on our customer 
margins and our ability to retain 
customers (Political and Regulatory 
Intervention; Customer Service; Strategy 
Delivery; and Brand, Trust and Reputation);
• a sustained significant adverse movement 
in commodity prices (External Market 
Environment and Financial Market);
• our inability to respond to disruption from 
competition in the market and deliver 
transformation through cost savings and 
growth in new businesses (Strategy 
Delivery and Change Management);
• risks associated with keeping our people 
and our customers safe, incorporating 
potential adverse consequences of 
breaches in regulatory compliance 
obligations and the impact of a loss of 
containment in our upstream assets 
(Health, Safety, Environment and 
Security; and Legal, Regulatory and 
Ethical Standards Compliance);
• challenges relating to the security of 
our systems and keeping our data safe, 
including cyber-security and, in future, 
a breach of GDPR requirements 
(Information Systems and Security; and 
Legal, Regulatory and Ethical Standards 
Compliance); and
• a significant increase in the obligations of 
our pension schemes, requiring material, 
repeated cash injections (Balance Sheet 
Strength and Credit Position).
Centrica plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 | 61 Each of the scenarios are considered 
individually on a gross basis, with the 
impact of Group-level mitigating actions 
incorporated following the aggregation of 
the individual impacts.
These risks are included as sensitivities to 
our liquidity analysis, and are considered by 
the Board as part of the approval process 
for this statement.
Resilience
The sources of funding available to the 
Group, including undrawn committed credit 
facilities of £3.5 billion, are set out in note 24 
to the consolidated Financial Statements. 
The Board expects these sources, together 
with cash flows generated by the Group from 
its normal operations, to provide adequate 
levels of funding to support the execution 
of the Group’s plans. Cash flows generated 
during 2017 are set out in the cash flow 
statement and in note 24 (c) to these 
Financial Statements.
We then consider the Group’s resilience to 
risk and our ability to respond to changes 
in market conditions to identify potential 
mitigating actions, such as additional 
restrictions and limits on capital investment, 
further cost reduction opportunities and the 
future sustainability of our dividend policy.
Conclusion
The Directors have considered all the above 
factors in their assessment of viability over 
the next three years, including the Group’s 
strategic plan, levels of funding, scenario 
analysis and the principal risks and 
uncertainties facing the Group. The Directors 
have also considered the availability of 
mitigating actions within their control in the 
event that a number of simultaneous severe 
but plausible scenarios materialise. Based 
on the conclusions of this assessment, 
the Directors confirm that they have a 
reasonable expectation that no individual 
scenario identified or combination of 
identified scenarios, will impact on the 
Group’s ability to continue to operate and 
meet its liabilities, as they fall due, over a 
period of at least three years.
The Strategic Report, which has been 
prepared in accordance with the 
requirements of the Companies Act 2006, 
has been approved by the Board and 
signed on its behalf by:

Directors’ and Corporate Governance Report
Dear Shareholder
I am pleased to confirm that your Company has fully complied 
with the principles and provisions of the UK Corporate Governance 
Code (the Code) throughout the year and the following pages set  
out in detail how we have done so.
I should like to begin by expressing my sincere thanks to Lesley Knox 
who stepped down at the end of the year after six years’ service as a 
Non-Executive Director of Centrica. We are grateful for Lesley’s wise 
counsel around the board table and for her excellent stewardship as 
chair of the Remuneration Committee. We are currently conducting a 
search for a new Non-Executive Director and more detail on that can 
be found in the report of the Nominations Committee on page 77 . 
2017 was another busy year for UK Corporate Governance more 
widely. The Corporate Governance Reform Green Paper at the 
beginning of the year focused on three aspects where Government 
saw the need for further reform – executive pay, corporate 
governance in large privately-held businesses, and the steps that 
company boards take to engage and listen to employees, suppliers 
and other groups with an interest in corporate performance. At the 
time of writing, the Financial Reporting Council (FRC) was consulting 
on proposed changes to the Code aimed at addressing some of 
these issues.
I believe that since its introduction over 20 years ago, the Code has 
been, and remains, the foundation of excellence in how companies 
are run, and has helped the UK achieve a leading position in 
corporate governance. The Code has been successful, however, 
precisely because it has always been an evolving set of best practice 
guidelines, not a static list of rules. We therefore welcome the latest 
evolution and will work to support its aims.
As I set out in my statement on pages 4 to 5 of this Annual Report, 
we are proposing some changes to our governance arrangements 
within Centrica. I have asked our Non-Executive Director Joan Gillman 
to undertake a review of employee engagement and, once recruited, 
our new Non-Executive Director to review the needs of customers, 
and to ensure the voice of these key stakeholder groups is heard 
in the boardroom. As a company with over 30,000 employees and 
millions of customers, these stakeholders’ interests have always been 
integral to our discussions in Board meetings. These reviews will, 
however, build upon this and further sharpen our focus. I believe 
these steps will also work with the grain of the corporate governance 
reforms contemplated by Government and the FRC. 
Good corporate governance alone cannot guarantee business 
performance, but it is a necessary precondition – sustainable 
business success is not possible without sound corporate 
governance. This section describes the governance arrangements 
within Centrica and I hope readers will find it interesting and informative.

Our Governance Structure
The Board
The Board is responsible for promoting the overall success of 
the Company. In doing so, it delegates certain responsibilities to 
Board Committees and executive management. Details of the 
Board Committees and their activities during the year are set out 
on pages 72 to 79. 
The Board delegates authority to the Group Chief Executive for 
the execution of strategy and the day-to-day management of the 
Group. The Board oversees, guides and challenges executive 
management in the execution of these activities.
    Read more about Our Strategy and Our Business Model  
Pages 10 to 11 and 12 to 13. 
Matters reserved exclusively for the Board
There are certain key responsibilities that the Board does not 
delegate and which are reserved for its consideration. The full 
Schedule of Matters Reserved is available on our website, 
but key features include:
• the development of strategy and major policies;
• approving the annual operating plan, Financial Statements 
and major acquisitions and disposals;
• approving interim dividend payments and recommending 
final dividend payments; and
• the appointment and removal of Directors and the  
Company Secretary.

UK Corporate Governance Code (the Code) compliance
Effective corporate governance provides an essential foundation 
for the long-term success of the Company. This report sets out the 
key elements of Centrica’s corporate governance arrangements, 
including how we have sought to apply the principles and provisions 
of the Code. The Board confirms that, up to the date of this report, 
it fully complied with the Code.
The Board further confirms that, through the activities of the Audit 
and Safety, Health, Environment, Security and Ethics Committees, 
described on pages 72 and 76, it has reviewed the effectiveness 
of the Company’s system of risk management and internal controls.
The Code and associated guidance are available on the Financial 
Reporting Council website at frc.org.uk 
Board meetings
The Board held nine meetings in 2017 , seven of which were in person 
and two by scheduled telephone conferences. Each year the Board 
seeks to combine one or two meetings with visits to the Group’s 
operations and in 2017 visited the Barrow Gas Terminal in March 
and the Group’s US Headquarters in Houston in September. Details 
of these visits can be found on page 71.

Directors
During the year under review the Board comprised 12 Directors, 
of whom four were Executive and eight, including the Chairman, were 
Non-Executive. Lesley Knox stepped down from the Board with 
effect from 31 December 2017 . As we announced in February 2017 , 
Scott Wheway succeeded Lesley as Remuneration Committee 
Chairman in May 2017 . While the Company believes strongly in the 
benefits of regularly refreshing Board membership, it was felt that 
having appointed five new Non-Executive and three new Executive 
Directors over the 2015 to 2016 period, no further changes to Board 
composition were required in 2017 . 
Further information on the background, experience, current tenure, 
Committee membership and other appointments of each Director 
can be found in the individual biographies on pages 64 and 65.
In line with best practice, the roles of our Chairman and Group Chief 
Executive are separate, formalised in writing and have been approved 
by the Board. A summary of these and other roles are shown in our 
governance structure on page 68.
During the year, the Non-Executive Directors, including the Chairman, 
met frequently without management present. In addition, the Senior 
Independent Director met with the Non-Executive Directors in the 
absence of the Chairman to appraise the Chairman’s performance.
The Board has agreed that each Director shall stand for reappointment 
at each Annual General Meeting (AGM). Copies of the Executive 
Directors’ service contracts and letters of appointment for the Non-
Executive Directors are available for inspection by shareholders 
at each AGM and during normal business hours at the Company’s 
registered office.
Director independence and conflicts
All of our Non-Executive Directors are considered to be independent 
against the criteria in the Code and free from any business interest 
which could materially interfere with the exercise of their judgement. In 
addition, the Board is satisfied that each Non-Executive Director is able 
to dedicate the necessary amount of time to the Company’s affairs. 
In accordance with the Companies Act 2006 (the Act) and the 
Company’s Articles, Directors are required to report actual or 
potential conflicts of interest to the Board for consideration and, 
if appropriate, authorisation. If such conflicts exist, Directors recuse 
themselves from consideration of the relevant subject matter. The 
Company maintains a schedule of authorised conflicts of interest 
which is regularly reviewed by the Board.

Directors’ induction
All new Directors appointed to the Board receive a comprehensive 
induction programme. These include briefings from members of 
the Executive and management teams covering key areas of the 
business, an overview of the Group’s risk management processes, 
the internal audit function and the corporate governance framework 
within Centrica. The induction programme also includes a series 
of site visits for new Directors to familiarise themselves with the 
Group’s businesses.
Training and support for Directors
Ongoing training is provided for all Directors, including formal and 
informal briefings, meetings with management and visits to the 
Group’s operations. As part of this approach, two formal Board 
insight and training sessions are held each year. In 2017 , these 
sessions covered ‘Our Code’ (the replacement for Centrica’s former 
Business Principles and other codes of conduct that existed across 
the business) in July and, in November, a briefing from Deloitte on 
changes to Accounting Standards and on Internal Controls and Risk 
Management. In addition, the Directors have full access to the advice 
and services of the Group General Counsel & Company Secretary, 
who is responsible for advising the Board, through the Chairman, 
on corporate governance matters. They are also able to seek 
independent professional advice at the Company’s expense in 
respect of their duties.
Key issues considered by the Board
During the year, the Board considers a comprehensive programme 
of regular matters covering operational and financial performance 
reporting, strategic reviews and updates and various governance 
reports and approvals. In addition, each Board meeting features 
deep dives into a specific operation or topic. In 2017 , these 
discussions included:
• Strategic reviews for Centrica Consumer 
and Centrica Business divisions;
• the adoption of Centrica’s new Values;
• Process Safety;
• Group Brand architecture and reputation;
• IT, Technology and Innovation;
• the Competitive Landscape;
• Exploration & Production portfolio and pipeline; and
• People and Capability.
Board diversity
Centrica recognises the benefits of diversity in all its forms, at Board 
level and throughout the Group. During 2017 , 25% of the Board were 
women and comprised Directors from the UK, US, Canada and Italy 
with a wide range of backgrounds and expertise. Centrica supports 
the recommendations of the Hampton-Alexander Review and is 
continuing to develop the skills, experience and knowledge of a 
diverse pipeline of talent. Our Nominations Committee is committed 
to ensuring and promoting a diverse blend of skills, backgrounds and 
nationalities on the Board.

Employee and senior management diversity
Centrica’s policies and practices reflect and encourage a culture 
where decisions are based on individual ability and potential 
in relation to the needs of the business. We promote equal 
opportunities and diversity to create an inclusive working 
environment that attracts and retains the best people and enables 
everyone in Centrica to fulfil their potential. In 2017 , we started to 
roll-out unconscious bias training as part of a wider effort to remove 
barriers to employment and ensure all individuals are treated in 
a non-discriminatory manner at all stages of their employment, 
including recruitment and selection, promotion and performance 
management. We are committed to creating an inclusive workplace 
in which all employees are able to thrive. By delivering on this we 
are able to:
• attract and retain a diverse range of talent;
• enhance our employer brand;
• create an inclusive environment so that everyone feels safe 
to bring their whole self to work; and
• ensure people receive career opportunities based on merit 
so that we have the best talent in the right jobs.
At the senior management level 28%
†
 of our people are female. 
For other employees that figure is 29%
†
. Centrica continues to offer a 
range of initiatives including coaching and mentoring of diverse talent. 
We also participate in the 30% Club’s cross-company, cross-sector 
mentoring scheme for mid-career women. We are excited to be 
developing a programme aimed at enabling women to return to the 
workplace who have been out of work for two years or longer, which 
will be launched in 2018.
This year we launched a new Disability and Wellbeing Network 
(DAWN). Alongside our existing networks in the UK (Women, Carers, 
LGBT) and in the US (Women, LGBT, BOLD (Black Organisation 
Leadership Development) and HONOR (for Veterans)), this will 
continue to grow and support our employees. As a mark of 
Centrica’s commitment to diversity and inclusion, we achieved 
Bronze recognition in the annual Business in the Community 
benchmarking survey. The Managing Director of Distributed Energy 
& Power, Jorge Pikunic, was also named among the Top 100 
Executives in the Financial Times’ 2017 OUTstanding Leading LGBT+ 
& Ally Executives and LGBT+ Future Leaders lists. This year, for the 
first time in our history, we celebrated National Inclusion Week 
bringing together all our diversity groups and acknowledging the 
benefits of inclusion.
In 2017 , we worked toward achieving Disability Confident level 1 
status and we are pleased that this has been accredited for 2018.
In addition, we are delighted to be recognised in the 2017 Stonewall 
Workplace Equality Index, where we were ranked in the 66th 
percentile. Centrica plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 | 71
Site visits
While the bulk of the Board’s work is necessarily conducted 
around the Boardroom table, Directors recognise the 
importance of visiting the ‘coal face’ and seeing the Group’s 
operations first-hand. During 2017 , the Board visited 
operations at the Barrow Gas Terminal in the UK and the 
Group’s North America headquarters in Houston.
In February 2017 , a decision was made to stop production 
at Barrow and take a Stand Down for Safety focused on 
maintenance, streamlining the management of change 
process and development of improved operating procedures. 
The Board visited in March 2017 to understand better how 
process safety risks are managed and to bring to life real 
examples of process safety in action within a high hazard 
operation. The visit, over two days, involved presentations 
from local management, discussions with employees and 
an in-depth tour of the facility. 
In September 2017 , the Board visited Centrica’s North 
America headquarters in Houston, Texas. The visit comprised 
a scheduled Board meeting and discussions with the North 
American leadership team on strategy and performance but, 
most importantly, afforded an opportunity for Directors to 
meet with North American colleagues and understand how 
they were faring in the immediate aftermath of the hurricanes 
Harvey and Irma. Whilst the impact had been devastating 
and many of our employees affected, it was heartening to see 
the way in which our people, the city of Houston and the State 
of Texas had pulled together in adversity. Moreover, the wider 
Centrica family had come together, with offers of help and 
generous donations to the Centrica Employee Relief Fund 
from employees across the Group.

and customers through Hurricane Harvey

We support the UK Government’s gender pay gap reporting 
requirement. In the UK our gender pay gap is 12% mean and 30% 
median
(1)
. The gap is not driven by unequal pay but by the uneven 
distribution of men and women across the business and the type of 
roles they do. Like other employers in our sector, we have a greater 
proportion of men in higher paid, traditionally male-dominated 
technical roles such as engineering, which form a significant portion 
of our workforce. By contrast, we have a larger number of women 
in lower paid, less technical roles such as administration. We are 
focused on closing the gap by building a gender balanced talent 
pipeline through initiatives to attract, develop and retain women.

Board evaluation 
In accordance with the Code, Centrica conducts an annual 
evaluation of Board performance, which is facilitated by an 
independent third-party at least once every three years.
As reported last year, the results of the 2016 internal evaluation 
exercise were considered by the Board and Committees in February 
2017 and the topics where Directors had indicated a need for further 
discussion (new growth markets and the competitive landscape) 
were incorporated into the 2017 Board programme.
The 2017 independent third-party evaluation is being conducted by 
Independent Audit. This exercise, which was ongoing at the date of 
this Annual Report, comprised online questionnaires, interviews with 
all Directors, a review of Board papers and observation of a Board 
meeting. The results of the evaluation will be reviewed by the Board 
at its meeting in March 2018 and any findings built into an action plan. 
The Senior Independent Director, Stephen Hester, conducted 
the evaluation of the Chairman’s performance through a series 
of individual discussions with Directors and Senior Executives. 72 | Centrica plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017

Board; and
• to consider and review legal and regulatory compliance issues, 
specifically in relation to financial reporting and controls, and 
together with the Safety, Health, Environment, Security and Ethics 
Committee (SHESEC), maintain oversight of the arrangements in 
place for the management of statutory and regulatory compliance 
in areas such as financial crime.
Report of the Committee Chairman
This report aims to provide a summary of the workings and activities 
of the Committee during 2017 , outlining how we discharged our 
duty to provide oversight of the adequacy and effectiveness of the 
Company’s internal financial controls and internal control and risk 
management systems, the considerations we gave to matters of 
financial risk and control and the key accounting judgements reached.
The Committee has developed its agenda to enable, over the course 
of a year, active oversight of all key areas of responsibility and to 
facilitate deeper dives into topics of particular importance or 
pertinence. In 2017 this agenda included regular reports on Risk, 
Control and Assurance, Ethics and Compliance and Centrica 
Storage compliance with its undertakings, together with periodic 
items reviewed at fixed points annually (for example, interim and final 
financial results, internal and external audit plans, etc.). In addition, 
there were deep dives during the year covering, among other things, 
the Group Risk Universe, financial controls maturity, including 
benchmarking against other organisations and Deloitte first year 
observations, lessons learned from external examples of control 
failures in large corporations and Finance transformation initiatives 
and staff rotations. In its November meeting, the Committee 
discussed the emerging accounting issue in the North America 
Business unit and held a further meeting by teleconference shortly 
after to fully understand the scope of the issue, remedial actions 
taken and lessons learned. Following a thorough review of the issue 
a number of enhancements are being implemented to internal 
controls in the North America Business unit. The Committee also 
met twice with the SHESEC Committee to jointly consider the 
Group’s System of Risk Management and Internal Control; in the first 
quarter to assess the system’s effectiveness and in the fourth quarter 
to look prospectively at plans for 2018. More detail on the key issues 
considered by the Committee in 2017 are given below. 
I believe that the Committee has performed effectively in 2017 . 
Compliance with the Code, including the risk management and the 
viability statement requirements, is set out on pages 61 to 62.
Areas of focus and training
An annual schedule of training is designed to provide Directors with 
practical training and insight into specific areas of interest. In 2017 , 
these sessions covered Our Code (the replacement for Centrica’s 
former Business Principles and other codes of conduct that existed 
across the business) in July and, in November, a briefing from Deloitte 
on changes to Accounting Standards and on internal controls and 
risk management. In February 2018, the Committee also received 
training on the practical application of the certain re-measurements 
accounting and exceptional item policy. Centrica plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 | 73
Risk management and internal controls
Internal audit
The Committee is responsible for monitoring and reviewing the 
operation and effectiveness of the Group’s Internal Audit function, 
including its independence, strategic focus, activities, plans and 
resources. The appointment and removal of the Head of Internal 
Audit Risks and Controls is also a matter for the Committee. 
The Committee approved the Group’s annual Internal Audit plan 
which was primarily risk-based focusing on the assurance of core 
processes. As part of its consideration of the plan, the Committee 
reviewed staffing levels and qualifications to ensure these were 
appropriate and adequate for the delivery of the plan.
During the year, the Committee received regular reports summarising 
the findings from the Group’s Internal Audit function’s work and 
action plans to resolve any highlighted areas. The Committee 
monitored the progress of the most significant action plans to ensure 
these were completed satisfactorily. 
Review of the system of risk management and internal 
controls
Each year, an extensive process of self-certification operates 
throughout the Group whereby the effectiveness of internal controls 
and compliance with the Group’s Business Principles and policies 
are assessed. Self-certification is completed both at the half year and 
full year. The results of the annual process, together with the 
conclusions of the internal reviews by Internal Audit, inform the annual 
assessment of the effectiveness of the System of Risk Management 
and Internal Control performed by the Audit Committee and the 
SHESEC Committee, on behalf of the Board, in 2017 . Where 
necessary, improvements and enhancements to financial and 
commercial controls in the North America Business unit have been 
recommended and will be implemented in 2018.
External auditors
The Committee manages the relationship with the Group’s external 
auditors on behalf of the Board. The Committee considers annually 
the scope, fee, performance and independence of the external 
auditors as well as whether a formal tender process is required.
The Board considers it of prime importance that the external auditors 
remain independent and objective and as a safeguard against this 
being compromised, the Committee implemented and monitors a 
policy on the independence of external auditors. This policy details 
the process for the appointment of the external auditors, the 
tendering policy, the provision of non-audit services, the setting of 
audit fees and the rotation of audit partner and staff. There are no 
contractual or similar obligations restricting the Group’s choice of 
external auditors.
Effectiveness and independence of the external auditors
To assess the effectiveness and independence of the external 
auditors, the Committee carried out an assessment of Deloitte. 
This included a review of the report issued by the audit quality review 
team regarding Deloitte and an internal questionnaire completed by 
Committee members and relevant members of management on their 
views of Deloitte’s performance. The questionnaire covered a review 
of the audit partner and team, the audit scope and approach, audit 
plan execution, auditor independence and objectivity and robustness 
of the challenge of management. The feedback received was reviewed 
by management and reported to the Committee and the Board.
In addition, to ensure the independence of the external auditors and 
in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK & Ireland) 
260 and Ethical Standard 1 issued by the Accounting Practices 
Board and as a matter of best practice, Deloitte has confirmed its 
independence as auditors of the Company. Together with Deloitte’s 
confirmation and report on its approach to audit quality and 
transparency, the Committee concluded that Deloitte demonstrated 
appropriate qualifications and expertise and remained independent 
of the Group and that the audit process was effective.
Non-audit fees
In order to preserve the independence of the external auditor, the 
Committee is responsible for the policy on the award of non-audit 
services to the external auditors. A copy of this policy is available 
on our website. The current cap on non-audit work is £2.75 million, 
which is assessed annually for appropriateness against external 
guidance and regulation. The award of non-audit work, within 
permitted categories, is subject to pre-clearance by the Committee, 
should the fees in a given year exceed a specified threshold. 
All significant non-audit work is tendered and where Deloitte was 
appointed, it was considered that its skills and experience made 
it the most appropriate supplier of the work. 
Deloitte had been engaged to perform certain activities for the Group 
prior to their appointment as auditors and before their appointment, 
the Group undertook a thorough review of all pre-existing 
arrangements. As a result of this, certain arrangements were 
terminated during 2016 and whilst others were permissible under all 
relevant regulatory requirements, the decision was taken to wind 
them down during the first half of 2017 . The majority of non-audit fees 
included as ‘All other services’ noted in Note S9 to the Financial 
Statements relate to such transitional arrangements, which have  
now ceased.
Appointment of the external auditors
In 2016, the Committee led a formal audit tender process, 
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP having been the external auditor of the 
Group since the demerger of Centrica in 1997 . The conclusion of the 
tender process was a firm recommendation to appoint Deloitte as 
the Company’s auditor for the financial year commencing 1 January 
2017 and this appointment was approved by shareholders at the 
Annual General Meeting in May 2017 . 
Audit information
Each of the Directors who held office at the date of approval of the 
Annual Report and Accounts confirms that, so far as they are aware, 
there is no relevant audit information of which Deloitte is unaware 
and that they have taken all steps that they ought to have taken as 
Directors to make themselves aware of any relevant audit information 
and to establish that Deloitte is aware of that information. 74 | Centrica plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017

Key judgements and financial reporting matters in 2017 Audit Committee reviews and conclusions 
Impairment of goodwill, upstream gas and oil assets, 
power generation assets and storage facility assets
The Group makes judgements and estimates in considering whether the 
carrying amounts of its assets are recoverable. These judgements include 
primarily the achievement of Board-approved business plans, long-term 
projected cash flows, generation and production levels (including reserve 
estimates) and macroeconomic assumptions such as the growth and 
discount rates and long-term commodity and capacity market auction 
prices used in the valuation process. In the forecasts, where forward 
market prices are not available, prices are determined based on internal 
model inputs. 
The Committee reviewed management reports detailing the carrying 
and recoverable value of the assets and the key judgements and 
estimates used. At the year end it concluded pre-tax net impairments 
of Exploration & Production (E&P) assets of £408 million relating 
to the UK, Dutch and Norwegian assets were required, primarily due 
to a general reduction in price forecasts and changes to expected 
decommissioning costs. The Committee reviewed at the half year the 
recoverable value of the UK gas storage assets, following the decision 
to apply for a production licence for the Rough storage facility, and 
agreed a pre-tax impairment of £270 million. The Committee has 
reviewed the updated assumptions of the recoverable value of the 
UK gas storage assets at the end of the year and have concluded no 
adjustment to this impairment is required. The Committee reviewed 
the recoverable amount of all other significant balance sheet assets 
and concluded they had recoverable values in excess of the carrying 
value and were not impaired. The external auditors held discussions 
with the Committee on the key judgements and assumptions used 
in the impairment tests and provided their own analytical report. 
Further detail on impairments arising and the assumptions used in 
determining the recoverable amounts is provided in notes 7 and S2 
on pages 129 to 131 and 163 to 165.
Classification and presentation of exceptional items and 
certain re-measurements 
The Group reflects its underlying financial results in the business 
performance column of the Group Income Statement. To be able to 
provide this clearly and with consistent presentation, the effects of 
certain re-measurements of financial instruments and exceptional 
items are reported separately in a different column in the Group 
Income Statement.
The classification of items as exceptional and specific trades as certain 
re-measurements (or conversely own use or proprietary trades) are 
subject to defined Group policies. These policies are reviewed annually 
by management. 
In the prior year the Committee approved management’s policy for 
the classification of items as certain re-measurements or exceptional 
items. During the year the Committee reviewed the items classified as 
exceptional items, considering their size, nature and incidence. They 
concluded that separate disclosure of these items was appropriate in 
the Financial Statements. Exceptional items include the impairments 
of the Rough storage facility and the UK, Dutch and Norwegian E&P 
assets. They also include the gains and losses from the disposal of the 
Canadian E&P business and the UK CCGT fleet, and restructuring 
costs related to the strategic review announced in 2015 and costs 
associated with changing business structure in Storage, the E&P Spirit 
Energy formation transaction and the closure of US Solar. Further 
detail is provided in note 7 on pages 129 to 131.
Energy supply revenue recognition 
The Group’s revenue for energy supply activities includes an estimate of 
energy supplied to customers between the date of the last meter reading 
and an estimated year-end meter reading. It is estimated through the 
billing systems, using historical consumption patterns, on a customer-by-
customer basis, taking into account weather patterns, load forecasts 
and the differences between actual meter readings being returned and 
system estimates. An assessment is also made of any factors that are 
likely to materially affect the ultimate economic benefits which will flow to 
the Group, including bill cancellation and re-bill rates. To the extent that 
the economic benefits are not expected to flow to the Group, revenue is 
not recognised.
The Committee has reviewed and held discussions with the external 
auditors on the level of revenue accrual and provisions made during 
the year. In particular, the Committee has reviewed the reassessment 
of the historic recognition of unbilled power revenues, identified in late 
2017 in North America Business, which resulted in a one-off non-cash 
income statement charge of £46 million. The Committee reviewed 
both the cause and control issues that led to the reassessment and 
agreed additional measures with management to assess key 
judgements and processes as part of the year-end procedures, 
supported by independent experts. Further improvements to relevant 
processes and controls have been incorporated into future business 
planning. More details of accrued energy income and provision for 
credit loss is provided in note 17 on pages 144 to 145.  Centrica plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 | 75
Key judgements and financial reporting matters in 2017 Audit Committee reviews and conclusions 
Determination of long-term commodity prices and their 
use valuing commodity trades and other long-life assets
Long-term commodity price forecasts are derived using valuation 
techniques based on available external data. A significant number of 
judgements and assumptions are used in deriving future commodity 
curves. These forecasts are benchmarked against other third-party 
forecasts and, where appropriate, are adjusted to ensure they lie within 
the range of a reasonable market participant. The long-term commodity 
price forecasts are then used in determining the fair values of derivative 
financial instruments in North America and Europe. They are also a key 
input in the Group’s impairment valuation testing and Business 
Combination opening balance sheet valuations. 
The Committee reviewed the proposed commodity curves versus 
those of external third parties. The external auditors also provided 
detailed reporting and held discussions with the Committee on the 
potential impact of changes to the commodity curves. More detail on 
the assumptions used in determining fair valuations is provided in note 
S6 on pages 176 to 178. Sensitivities of the asset impairment tests to 
changes in price forecasts are provided in note 7 on page 130 to 131.
Business combinations
During the year, the Group acquired Bayerngas Norge to create a new 
combined E&P business with a non-controlling interest held by 
Stadtwerke München. The REstore NV business was also acquired to 
join the Distributed Energy & Power (DE&P) segment. Business 
combinations require a fair value exercise to be undertaken to allocate 
purchase price (cost) to the fair value of the acquired identifiable assets, 
liabilities, contingent liabilities and goodwill. As a result of the nature of fair 
value assessments in the energy industry, this purchase price allocation 
exercise requires subjective judgements based on a wide range of 
complex variables at a point in time. For the Bayerngas acquisition, 
judgement was required to conclude on the appropriate accounting 
treatment for the transaction and to assess the value of both the deemed 
purchase price and the asset valuations. 
The Committee reviewed the valuations, and the key judgements 
and estimates (see note 3(a)). The Committee also approved the 
disclosures in note 12. The external auditors also provided detailed 
reporting and held discussions with the Committee on the key 
judgements and assumptions used. Further details on business 
combinations are set out in note 12 on pages 136 to 137 .
Pensions
The cost, assets and liabilities associated with providing benefits under 
defined benefit schemes is determined separately for each of the 
Group’s schemes. Judgement is required in setting the key assumptions 
used for the actuarial valuation which determines the ultimate cost of 
providing post-employment benefits, especially given the length of the 
Group’s expected liabilities.
The Committee reviewed and approved the key assumptions and 
disclosures in the Financial Statements. Independent actuaries are 
consulted on the appropriateness of the assumptions and discussions 
are held with the external auditors. Further details on pensions are set 
out in note 22 on pages 148 to 152.
Going concern and liquidity risk
The Group experiences significant movements in its liquidity position 
due primarily to the seasonal nature of its business and margin cash. 
To mitigate this risk the Group holds cash on deposit and maintains 
significant committed facilities. The Group regularly prepares an 
assessment detailing these available resources to support the going 
concern assumption in preparing the Financial Statements. 
The Committee reviewed management’s funding forecasts and 
sensitivity analysis and the impact of various possible adverse events 
including significant commodity price movements and credit rating 
downgrades. The external auditors also provided detailed reporting 
and held discussions with the Committee. Following the review, 
the Committee recommended to the Board the adoption of the 
going concern statement in the Annual Report and Accounts 2017 . 
Further details on sources of finance are set out in note 24 on pages 
154 to 156 and in the Going Concern section in Other Statutory 
Information on page 100.
Ofgem Consolidated Segmental Statement
The Group is required to prepare an annual regulatory statement 
(Consolidated Segmental Statement (CSS)) for Ofgem which breaks 
down our licensed activities for the financial year into a generation, 
domestic and non-domestic and electricity and gas result. The CSS is 
reconciled to our externally reported International Financial Reporting 
Standards Annual Report and Accounts. The Group publishes the CSS 
at the same time as the full year Annual Report and Accounts and the 
CSS is independently audited. In preparing the CSS, judgement is 
required in the allocation of non-specific costs between domestic and 
non-domestic and electricity and gas and the distinction between 
licensed and non-licensed activities.
The Committee reviewed the Ofgem Consolidated Segmental 
Statement and the key judgements and disclosures made in its 
preparation. The external auditor also provided a detailed report 
and held discussions with the Committee. The full CSS and the 
independent audit opinion approved by the Committee for publication 
are set out on pages 203 to 214. 76 | Centrica plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Safety, Health, Environment, Security and Ethics Committee
Governance | Directors’ and Corporate Governance Report
Report of the Committee Chairman
Now in its second full year of operation, the Committee has 
developed its agenda to enable, over the course of a year, active 
oversight of all key areas of responsibility and to facilitate deeper 
dives into topics of particular importance or pertinence. 
For example, every Committee meeting includes reports and reviews 
of Health, Safety, Environment and Security; Ethics and Compliance; 
and Risk, Control and Assurance. In addition, in 2017 , there were 
deep dives covering, among other things, the preparation and 
publication of Centrica’s first Modern Slavery Act Statement and 
a detailed review of asset integrity governance and practices.
The Committee continued to prioritise safety, and in particular 
process safety, as a key focus area. In March 2017 , Directors visited 
the Barrow Gas terminal to see first-hand how process safety risks 
are being managed. More details on the visit to Barrow can be found 
on page 71. Whilst improving safety performance remains an ongoing 
priority, it was pleasing to note the considerable improvements in 
process safety performance over the year with zero

 process safety 
events (Tier 1) in 2017 (2016: 2) while process safety incident 
frequency rate (Tier 1 and 2) reduced to 0.14
† 
per 200,000 hours 
worked (2016: 0.33).
In July 2017 , the Committee held a special briefing session on 
Our Code and subsequently approved its implementation. Our Code 
is the replacement for Centrica’s former Business Principles and other 
codes of conduct that existed across the business. It will provide 
a single Group-wide reference point, both internally and externally, 
for all stakeholders about how we expect our people to protect the 
Company and themselves when working at Centrica.
The Committee met twice with the Audit Committee to jointly 
consider the Group’s system of internal control and risk management; 
in the first quarter to assess the system’s effectiveness and in the 
fourth quarter to look prospectively at plans for 2018. The joint 
Committee also reviewed Information Systems & Cyber-Security, 
covering the evolving cyber-threat landscape and how this risk is 
being managed within Centrica.

Role of the Committee
The Committee ensures there is a formal and appropriate 
procedure for the appointment of new Directors to the Board. 
The Committee is responsible for leading this process and 
making recommendations to the Board.
The Committee is chaired by the Chairman of the Board. During 
the year, the Group Chief Executive attended all Committee 
meetings, as did other key executives.
Report of the Committee Chairman
Although no new Directors were appointed to the Board in 2017 , 
Lesley Knox indicated in February that she would step down as 
a Director at the end of the year. The Committee recommended, 
and the Board approved, the appointment of Scott Wheway to 
replace Lesley as Remuneration Committee Chair from May 
2017 . The Committee also discussed and approved the scope 
and role profile for the search for a suitable candidate to replace 
Lesley as a Non-Executive Director. The Committee utilised the 
Board skills matrix to inform the role profile and expressed a 
preference for a female candidate with a strong entrepreneurial 
and commercial background. It was felt the search criteria 
should be sufficiently wide so as to encourage a diverse range 
of candidates and, in this regard, the Committee agreed that 
previous listed board experience need not be a prerequisite. 
This search was progressing at the time of writing. The 
Committee also reviewed the strength of succession plans for 
Executive Directors and certain senior management roles, 
including internal talent development resources and processes.

Role of the Committee
The Disclosure Committee is responsible for the implementation 
and monitoring of systems and controls in respect of the 
management and disclosure of inside information and for 
ensuring that regulatory announcements, shareholder circulars, 
prospectuses and other documents issued by the Company 
comply with applicable legal or regulatory requirements. The 
Committee has scheduled meetings each year to approve the 
interim and preliminary results announcements and trading 
statements and meets as required to review and approve ad 
hoc announcements (for example, acquisitions and disposals, 
Board appointments). In 2017 , the Committee met 13 times 
for these purposes.
The Committee is chaired by Iain Conn, the Group Chief 
Executive.
Responsibilities of the Disclosure Committee:
• Review the preliminary results announcement, the half-year 
results and the trading statements;
• Consideration of the release of regulatory and industry 
announcements;
• Review announcements regarding Board/key management 
changes; and
• Consideration of announcements in respect of specific 
projects. On behalf of the Board, I am pleased to present the Committee’s 
report for 2017 .
In summary
As highlighted elsewhere in this report, second half performance was 
weak even though Centrica has made significant progress on many 
fronts in 2017 whilst facing a number of difficult external pressures. 
In particular, the Committee noted that most Group objectives and 
milestones were achieved including completion of the material 
divestment programme, strengthening of the balance sheet through 
net debt reduction to £2.6 billion, cost efficiency targets were 
exceeded and significant progress was made on safety issues. 
Despite this, the Committee has a duty to consider these achievements 
against shareholder experience and give due weight to all of the 
outcomes in 2017 , which have not always reflected the exceptional 
efforts of Centrica’s workforce. In this context we have decided:
• to reduce Annual Incentive Plan (AIP) awards for the Executives 
to zero;
• to reduce the maximum potential Long Term Incentive Plan (LTIP) 
grant for the 2018/20 cycle from 300% to 250% in recognition of 
a lower starting share price; and
• to impose a pay freeze on all Executives’ salaries, where no pay 
rise will be granted in 2018.
These were difficult decisions but reflect a determination by the 
Centrica Board to demonstrate alignment between Centrica and 
its stakeholders. 
We are required to present a new Policy for approval at the 2018 
Annual General Meeting (AGM) and have been consulting with our 
major shareholders on proposed changes. We do not believe that 
the existing Policy requires wholesale change in structure or overall 
quantum, however, we have taken the opportunity to further align 
our Policy with strategy and market best practice. We are proposing 
to add a total shareholder return (TSR) measure to the LTIP , reduce 
the non-financial elements of both the AIP and LTIP , further align the 
AIP financial measures with current business plans and increase 
shareholding requirements for the Executives to 300% of base salary.
Remuneration outcomes for the year
Centrica’s performance in 2017 has been disappointing for 
shareholders and the Committee has taken measures to ensure 
that variable remuneration outcomes reflect alignment with the 
shareholder experience.
The Committee has assessed performance under the AIP for 2017 
on a formulaic basis against the original targets set. On this basis 
the performance achieved was above the threshold level of financial 
performance for cash flow and strong performance by the 
management team was reflected in considerable progress made 
against the strategic objectives in many areas. This would have 
resulted in an AIP outcome for the Executives in the range between 
threshold and target. 
However, in making its assessment of performance the Committee 
took into full consideration the overall shareholder experience over 
the period and, as a result, concluded that irrespective of the formulaic 
outcome it was not appropriate to make an AIP award to any of the 
Executives in relation to 2017 . The Committee has therefore exercised 
its discretion to reduce the AIP outcome to zero.
The Committee also needed to assess the vesting outcome for long-
term incentive awards that were made in early 2015. The LTIP awards 
were dependent on adjusted earnings per share (EPS), economic profit 
(EP), safety performance, employee engagement and customer 
service delivery as assessed by net promoter scores. Based on 
performance against these metrics over the three years the LTIP will 
vest at a level of 26% of the award. The value of the shares initially 
granted under the 2015 award has fallen and as such represents an 
outcome of approximately 47% of salary.

Membership and attendance
The Remuneration Committee (Committee) is chaired by Scott 
Wheway, an independent Non-Executive Director. Each member 
of the Committee is independent. No Director is involved in the 
determination of, or votes on, any matters relating to his or her 
own remuneration.
The Chairman of the Board, the Group Chief Executive, the 
Group General Counsel & Company Secretary, the Group 
HR Director and the Deputy Group HR Director & Group Head of 
Reward are normally invited to attend each Committee meeting 
and provide advice and guidance, other than in respect of their 
own remuneration.
Responsibilities of the Remuneration Committee:
• determine total individual remuneration packages and terms 
and conditions of employment for the Executive Directors 
(Executives), the Executive Committee (CEC) and the 
Chairman of the Board;
• approve the design, metrics and targets for incentive 
schemes for the Executives and CEC members, review 
results and approve any payouts under these schemes;
• prepare and recommend to the Board for approval at 
least every three years the Remuneration Policy (Policy) for 
the Directors; and
• prepare and recommend to the Board for approval each 
year a report on the implementation of the Policy in the last 
financial year.
During 2017 , the Committee also discussed developments, 
trends and stakeholder views on executive remuneration with 
the independent external Committee adviser, and reviewed 
the base salary increases and bonus awards for the senior 
management population across the Group. An annual evaluation 
of the Committee was conducted in December 2016 and the 
results were discussed during the early part of the year.

Remuneration Report
Governance | Remuneration Report Mark Hanafin, the only Executive in employment during the operation 
of the Policy prior to that approved by shareholders in 2015, was 
entitled to and received a matching award in relation to the deferral 
of part of his 2014 annual bonus under the final year of operation of 
the Deferred and Matching Share Scheme (DMSS). The Committee 
reviewed the original EP target set in early 2015, which related to the 
portfolio of business units that Mark was responsible for at that 
time and, due to significant changes within his portfolio during the 
performance period and the volatility in commodity prices impacting 
the Exploration & Production (E&P) business unit, decided that the 
calculated result when compared to the target, which suggested 
that the maximum should vest, was no longer a fair measure of 
performance. Using its discretion and in accordance with the 
scheme rules, the Committee revised the target upwards and set 
it on a constant environment basis. The revised threshold and 
maximum levels were £80 million and £160 million respectively. 
The result was £129 million and consequently the Committee 
decided that 81% of the award should vest.
It has been previous practice to agree salary adjustments in April of 
each year and report them retrospectively in the Remuneration Report. 
From 2018 it is our intention to report them on a forward looking basis 
for the year. Accordingly this report details the decisions for both 2017 
and 2018. 
In 2017 , increases in salary not exceeding 2% were awarded to the 
Executives in line with the wider workforce, save for Jeff Bell who 
also received a 2.55% progression-related increase. The Committee 
intentionally set Jeff’s salary on appointment to the Board in August 
2015 at a level that reflected his experience at that time and on the 
understanding that it would in future be reviewed. Having made the 
adjustment in April 2017 , the Committee was then satisfied that Jeff’s 
salary appropriately reflected his role and contribution and would not 
expect such an adjustment to be repeated in the future.
Remuneration in the upcoming year
In 2018, no Executive will receive a salary increase. The Committee 
has also considered the impact that the current share price could 
have on the number of shares to be granted under the 2018/20 LTIP 
cycle. As a result the Committee has decided to reduce the award 
level for 2018 to 250% of salary in recognition of the current level of 
Centrica’s share price.
Fairness/equal pay
Enhancements to both practice and reporting capability throughout 
the year have enabled the Committee to review and disclose for the 
first time an assessment of pay against the relevant functional and 
geographic market median for all roles across the Group. The 
median, lower and upper quartile ratio is set out on page 96, along 
with the equivalent comparison to market median for the Group Chief 
Executive, and demonstrates a fair and consistent approach to the 
determination of pay. We have robust processes in place to uphold 
equal pay. This includes conducting an equal pay audit each year. 
When comparing pay across equivalent jobs, our gender pay gap 
is 1% at median with the difference attributed to factors relating to 
experience. We work hard to be a company where everyone can 
progress in their careers and achieve their full potential. We know, 
however, that there is more we can and must do. Further information 
on pay fairness will be disclosed in March within the Gender Pay 
Statement.
Remuneration Policy review
As Centrica’s Policy was last approved by shareholders in 2015 it will 
be the subject of a shareholder vote at the AGM in May 2018. During 
the year the Committee undertook a full review of our existing 
arrangements. We concluded from this that while our current 
remuneration structure generally worked well and was largely fit 
for purpose, there was an opportunity to improve the alignment 
of executive remuneration with both our strategic goals and the 
experience and expectations of shareholders. We are committed to 
ensuring that our revised Policy more closely aligns to our strategy 
and the delivery of long-term shareholder value through returns and 
growth whilst also taking into account evolving stakeholder views on 
executive pay. 
Under the AIP , we propose to increase the weighting towards 
financial performance and move to 75% financial measures and 25% 
personal objectives (for 2017 , the measures were 62.5% cash flow 
and 37 .5% personal objectives). The financial measures will in future 
be a mix based on Centrica’s priorities for the forthcoming year. For 
2018 the measures will be adjusted operating cash flow, operating 
profit and cost efficiency.
For the LTIP , going forward from the 2018/20 cycle, the performance 
measures will consist of relative TSR with the most significant weighting 
(33.3%) and cash flow growth (22.2%), EP (22.2%), and non-financial 
KPIs (22.2%). The Committee believes that this combination creates 
the right balance between doing the right thing for the business, whilst 
aligning Executives to the shareholder experience.
For the Group’s non-financial KPIs, we are proposing to change from 
using annual targets aggregated across the LTIP performance period, 
to three-year targets for improvement. The LTIP targets for awards 
due to be made in 2018 are set out on page 89.
We continue to be committed to full transparency and disclosure, 
and in future will disclose all other targets as soon as any commercial 
sensitivity falls away, and at the latest at the end of the performance 
period. 
We are also proposing the following changes to the Policy to reflect 
evolving market practice:
• an increase in the shareholding requirement for Executives from 
200% to 300% of base salary, with a condition to retain 75% 
of vested incentive shares (post-tax) until the requirement has 
been met;
• the introduction of a post-cessation shareholding requirement of 
50% of the shareholding requirement (or full actual holding if lower) 
applicable for 24 months post-cessation;
• the simplification of our bonus deferral to three-year cliff vesting 
(rather than phased vesting); and
• a reduction in the maximum pension salary supplement available 
to newly recruited Executives to 25% of salary (currently 30% 
of salary for the Group Chief Executive and 25% of salary for 
other Executives). 
We have come to these decisions on our Policy following extensive 
consultation with our largest shareholders. I would like to thank them 
for their time and constructive input to our deliberations. Our inclusion 
of TSR within the long-term metrics reflects the feedback we received 
from the majority of our shareholders on the importance they placed 
on the inclusion of output measures within the LTIP . 
Conclusion
Overall, 2017 has been a challenging year for Centrica as a business 
and our shareholders. The Committee remains dedicated to ensuring 
that remuneration arrangements recognise the strong performance 
of the business whilst remaining appropriate in the context of 
shareholder experience. The Committee believes that the decisions 
made over the year in designing the new Policy, exercising discretion 
in relation to the AIP , and the discretion relating to the final DMSS 
vesting and 2018 LTIP grant, allow us to achieve this aim and align 
pay and performance effectively. The Committee is dedicated to 
an open and transparent dialogue with our investors and therefore 
I welcome views on any part of our remuneration arrangements.

(1) Taxable benefits include car allowance, health and medical benefits and financial planning advice. Non-taxable benefits include matching shares received under the Share 
Incentive Plan (SIP). Benefits paid to Mark Hodges in 2016 include relocation support paid in line with Centrica’s relocation policy.
(2) LTIPs include the estimated value of the LTIP awards granted in 2015 and due to vest in May 2018 (August 2018 in respect of Jeff Bell), relating to the three-year performance 
period ending in 2017. Details of the performance outcomes are set out on pages 85 to 86. The estimated value of dividend equivalent shares has been included and the share 
price used to value the awards is 159.17 pence (the average share price from 1 October to 31 December 2017).
(3) For Mark Hanafin, as set out below, LTIPs also include the estimated value of the final DMSS matching award granted in 2015 (under the previously approved policy) and due 
to vest in April 2018. As detailed on page 79, 81% of the DMSS matching award will vest. The estimated value of dividend equivalents has been included and the share price 
used to value the award is 159.17 pence (the average share price from 1 October to 31 December 2017).

(4) The value of the recruitment award shares vesting in April 2017 has been recalculated based on the share price on the date of vest which was 215.5 pence. The previous disclosure 
in the 2016 single figure table used an estimated share price. Iain Conn’s total remuneration for 2016 has therefore been restated to include the amended value of this award.
(5) Notional contributions to the Centrica Unapproved Pension Scheme defined contribution section (CUPS DC) for Jeff Bell and Mark Hanafin have been included in this table 
as if CUPS DC was a cash balance scheme. This includes a deduction in respect of an allowance for CPI inflation on the opening balances of 0.9% in 2017 (no allowance was 
applicable in 2016).
(6) Iain Conn and Mark Hodges are entitled to receive a salary supplement of 30% and 25% of base salary respectively.

Directors’ Annual Remuneration Report
Governance | Remuneration Report Base salary/fees
Base salaries for Executives were reviewed during the year and were 
increased with effect from 1 April 2017 , as follows:
Previous Salary Increase % New Salary
Iain Conn £925,000 1.62% £940,000
Jeff Bell £550,000 4.55% £575,000
Mark Hanafin £625,000 2.00% £637,500
Mark Hodges £625,000 2.00% £637,500
Jeff Bell received an additional increase to appropriately reflect his 
role and contribution, recognising that his salary had been set at a 
lower level on promotion to the Board in 2015. The other increases 
for the Executives in aggregate were lower than the average increase 
across the rest of the organisation.
Base fees for Non-Executives, as well as the additional fee for the 
Chairman of the Audit Committee, were increased on 1 January 
2016. There were no increases to Non-Executive fees during 2017 .
Bonus – Annual Incentive Plan (AIP)
The charts on page 80 under short-term incentive outcome indicate 
the extent of achievement against individual strategic objectives for 
each Executive and against the adjusted operating cash flow (AOCF) 
target. In accordance with the Policy, the maximum AIP is 200% of 
base salary. Half of the maximum is payable for on-target performance. 
Up to 75% of base salary is based on the achievement against 
individual strategic objectives aligned to the Group’s strategic 
priorities, with the remainder based on AOCF.
AOCF of £2,231 million was required for target achievement and 
£2,343 million was required for maximum. The threshold level was 
£2,008 million. Although the formulaic result of £2,069 million was 
above the threshold level and considerable progress had been made 
against strategic objectives in many areas, the Committee concluded 
that irrespective of the formulaic outcome, it was not appropriate to 
make an AIP award to any Executive in relation to 2017 .
AOCF is the net cash flow from operating activities (which includes 
taxes paid) adjusted to include dividends received from joint ventures 
and associates, and to exclude payments relating to exceptional items, 
UK defined benefit pension deficit contributions and movements in 
variation margin and cash collateral that are included in net debt. 
Performance against individual strategic  
objectives in 2017
In line with the Group’s annual performance management process, 
each Executive had an agreed set of stretching individual objectives 
for 2017 . Set out below is the Committee’s assessment of the 
achievement against these objectives for each Executive.
Iain Conn
Iain Conn’s performance against the strategic objectives of the 
Group has resulted in strong delivery of the first phase of the strategy, 
including the successful portfolio repositioning and Mergers & 
Acquisitions (M&A) programme, cash discipline, balance sheet 
improvement, credit rating protection and the delivery of the 2020 
efficiency target three years early. Occupational safety rates have 
remained consistent across the year whilst significant improvements 
have been achieved in process safety, driving safety and customer 
safety. Regulatory relationships continued to be well managed. 
There has been significant development of customer propositions 
and the capabilities and strategic frameworks of both Consumer and 
Business divisions. Customer service levels have, in general, also 
continued to improve.
Outcomes elsewhere have, however, been weaker than planned. 
The pace of growth of the Connected Home and Distributed Energy 
& Power (DE&P) businesses has been considerable but did not meet 
all expectations and whilst performance across the Group’s financial 
targets, which were focused on cash flow, balance sheet strength 
and efficiency have been met, Group earnings were significantly 
impacted by issues in North America Business and UK Business 
in the second half of the year.
The timing and scale of the North America Business performance 
and accounting issues combined with the uncertainty created by 
political and regulatory intervention into the UK energy market have 
overshadowed the significant strategic progress and operational 
delivery throughout the rest of the Group over the year. The net 
result has been a severe drop in the market worth of the Company, 
a situation for which a CEO will always be held to account.
Jeff Bell
Jeff Bell’s achievements against his strategic objectives for the year 
include significant progress on the finance transformation programme 
and delivery of cost efficiency, improvement in performance 
monitoring and strong management of the rating agency relationships. 
A key deliverable was oversight of strong M&A portfolio programme 
delivery with the successful divestments of Lincs Wind Farm, Canada 
E&P , the combined cycle gas turbines (CCGTs), the establishment 
of Spirit Energy and the acquisition of REstore. As a result the Group 
balance sheet was strengthened materially during the year with 
Group net debt reduced to within the targeted year-end range. 
There have been challenges for Jeff during the year, particularly in 
North America Business associated with planning and performance 
forecasting, and the discovery of the revenue recognition issue. 
However, Jeff has significantly contributed to the general improvement 
of the strategic planning, performance management and monitoring 
processes of the Group, including a tighter quarterly review process 
and monitoring of the Group efficiency programme. The approach 
to the Enterprise Risk Framework and risk management has been 
further improved and standardised.
Jeff continued to focus significant attention on Investor Relations, 
but clearly the Trading Update in November combined with 
uncertainty associated with the UK energy market have undermined 
investor confidence. 
Overall, 2017 has been a challenging year for Jeff with significant 
efforts on inputs and strong delivery on functional priorities, against 
an unsatisfactory financial performance for the Group overall which 
resulted in a negative investor/share price reaction in the fourth quarter.
82 | Centrica plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Centrica plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 | 83 Mark Hanafin
Mark Hanafin achieved a significant amount in 2017 , including 
delivering very strong results relative to plan in Energy Marketing & 
Trading (EM&T), establishing and growing DE&P and significantly 
delivering all major outcomes in M&A. 
Safety and regulatory performance have improved in Centrica 
Business and a new approach to risk and market conduct has been 
established within EM&T. Mark effectively led the thinking on the 
five pillar strategic framework for the Business division and he has 
successfully motivated and developed his leadership teams.
Under Mark’s leadership, EM&T and DE&P are developing in line 
with strategy, improving capability, integrating recent acquisitions 
and growing customer relationships. DE&P has integrated recent 
acquisitions to establish new customer propositions and a new 
branded marketing platform, and order book growth has been 
encouraging. The LNG business has developed significantly 
throughout the year, successfully mitigating portfolio risk and 
establishing important new relationships with a range of counterparts. 
Mark continued to oversee Centrica’s Nuclear shareholding and 
became Chairman of Spirit Energy in December.
However, North America and UK Business, which moved into Mark’s 
portfolio in early 2017 , were materially behind plan and although there 
were significant competitive pressures and market developments, 
weaknesses in areas of forecasting and risk management were 
a material factor in North America and this was the largest contributor 
to Centrica’s profit warning in November.
Overall, Mark has established the Business division successfully 
although financial performance across his portfolio during the year 
has been weak with particularly disappointing results in North 
America Business.
Mark Hodges
Mark Hodges performed strongly in 2017 with good overall delivery 
in Centrica Consumer against material pressures externally. Mark led 
a broad agenda and demonstrated strong leadership, establishing 
a capable and motivated divisional team, a robust platform and 
resilient plans for the future.
Safety performance improved materially in the areas of customer and 
road safety, although occupational safety deteriorated, most notably 
within the smart meter programme. The regulatory relationships 
with both Ofgem and the Financial Conduct Authority continued 
to improve. Mark shaped Centrica’s response to the proposed 
intervention in the UK Energy Market, managing external relationships 
well, and developed our ‘14 point plan’ for improving the market.
The Centrica Consumer division as a whole delivered solid financial 
results and cost efficiency programme targets and headcount 
reductions were exceeded. Operationally, the customer losses during 
the year were a major concern for the market, but we have been clear 
about targeting sustainable and profitable channels rather than simply 
volume in our customer base. Connected Home missed its hub target 
but beat the product target and achieved the first major partnership 
deal with Eni gas e luce in Italy.
Mark put significant effort into customer segmentation, proposition 
development, more dynamic pricing and customer journeys. 
Customer service improved for the third year in a row, UK Home 
Services also began to see growth in accounts and Local Heroes 
and British Gas Rewards were established.
Overall, although customer losses were beyond planned levels 
and results within Connected Home were mixed, given the breadth 
of Mark’s responsibilities he achieved a strong set of inputs 
demonstrating considerable leadership, focus and determination.

Vesting increases on a straight-line basis between these points
3/8 based on non-financial KPI dashboard  
over the 3-year performance period
As disclosed below
Performance outcome
Adjusted earnings per share (EPS) 
EPS is the Company’s basic earnings per share adjusted for 
exceptional items and certain re-measurements net of taxation.
EPS growth during the two-year period ending with 2017 did not 
exceed RPI growth by 6%. Consequently, the EPS portion of the 
2015 LTIP award will not vest.
Economic profit (EP) 
EP is the adjusted operating profit (after share of joint venture interest) 
less a tax charge based on the tax rate relevant to the different 
business segments and after deduction of a capital charge. 
The capital charge is calculated as capital employed multiplied by 
the Group’s weighted average cost of capital. Where appropriate, 
expenditure on assets (and related costs) that are not yet in use 
(pre-productive capital) is excluded from capital employed. 
Aggregate EP achieved during the three-year period ending with 
2017 was £1,886 million when compared to a threshold level of 
£1,500 million and a maximum level of £3,500 million. Consequently, 
19% of the EP portion of the 2015 LTIP award will vest.
LTIP non-financial KPI dashboard 
Performance against five equally-weighted KPIs is measured each 
year. Achievement against each target determines the performance 
zone outcome. The KPI dashboard comprises results over a three-
year period.
Throughout each three-year performance period, for each median 
performance zone outcome, 5% of the KPI portion of the award will 
be forfeited and for each low performance zone outcome, 10% of the 
KPI portion of the award will be forfeited.

LTIP award vesting.
84 | Centrica plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Centrica plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 | 85 Based on achievement against the LTIP performance conditions over the three-year performance period, as set out on page 85, the LTIP 
granted in 2015 will vest at a level of 26% of the award. The value of the shares initially granted under the 2015 award has fallen and as such 
represents an outcome of approximately 47% of salary (the final value will be established on the vesting date).
Pension
Iain Conn and Mark Hodges elected to receive salary supplements of 30% and 25% of base salary respectively, in lieu of participating 
in a Centrica pension plan. These salary supplements are included in the single figure for total remuneration table on page 82.
Jeff Bell is entitled to receive a salary supplement of 25% of base salary or participate in the CUPS DC scheme. As Mark Hanafin was an 
Executive prior to 2014, he is entitled to receive a salary supplement of 40% of base salary or participate in the CUPS DC scheme. During the 
year, they both participated in the CUPS DC scheme and received an unfunded promise equal to 25% and 40% of base salary respectively.
Notional contributions to the CUPS DC scheme have been included in the single figure for total remuneration table as if it was a cash balance 
scheme and therefore notional investment returns for the year have been included. The notional pension fund balances are disclosed below.

Directors’ Annual Remuneration Report (continued) Advice to the Remuneration Committee
Following a competitive tender process, PwC was appointed as 
independent external adviser to the Committee in May 2017 , 
replacing Aon Consulting Ltd (Aon) who had been acting as the 
interim external adviser since March 2016. 
PwC also provided advice to Centrica globally during 2017 in the 
areas of employment taxes, regulatory risk and compliance issues 
and additional consultancy services.
PwC’s fees for advice to the Committee during 2017 amounted 
to £48,000 which included the preparation for and attendance at 
Committee meetings. The fees were charged on a time spent basis 
in delivering advice that materially assisted the Committee in their 
consideration of matters relating to executive remuneration.
Aon has also provided advice and services to Centrica globally 
during 2017 in the areas of payroll and workforce administration 
as well as system and process implementation. Aon’s fees for 
advice to the Committee during 2017 amounted to £2,900.
The Committee takes into account the Remuneration Consultants 
Group’s (RCG) Code of Conduct when dealing with its advisers. 
Both PwC and Aon are members of the RCG and the Committee is 
satisfied that the advice it received during the year was objective and 
independent and that the provision of any other services by PwC and 
Aon in no way compromises their independence.

Implementation in the next financial year
Base salaries for Executives were reviewed in January 2018 and the 
Committee agreed that there will be no salary increases for any of the 
Executives in 2018.
No changes to pensions or benefits for current Executives 
are anticipated.
AIP awards will be in line with the limits set out in the Remuneration 
Policy table, not exceeding 200% of base salary. 75% of the award 
will be based on a mix of financial measures based on Centrica’s 
priorities for the forthcoming year and 25% will be based on personal 
objectives. 
For the operation of the AIP in 2018, 20% of the financial measures 
will be based on cost efficiency, 40% of the financial measures will 
be based on adjusted operating cash flow (AOCF) and 40% of the 
financial measures will be based on operating profit, with targets 
aligning to the Group Annual Plan. The targets are considered 
commercially sensitive until the year end and will therefore be 
disclosed retrospectively in the Remuneration Report for 2018.
LTIP awards will be granted based on 250% of base salary, in 
recognition of the current level of Centrica’s share price. The 
performance measures will consist of relative total shareholder 
return (TSR) with a weighting of 33.3%, underlying adjusted operating 
cash flow (UAOCF) growth with a weighting of 22.2%, economic 
profit (EP) with a weighting of 22.2% and non-financial KPIs with 
a weighting of 22.2%.
It is proposed that the following financial targets will apply to the 2018 
LTIP awards:

It is proposed that threshold performance will equate to 25% vesting

of the gap between current performance and our long-term 
aspirational goals which are generally aligned with upper quartile 
market performance:

Centrica plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 | 89 As Centrica’s Directors’ Remuneration Policy (Policy) was last 
approved by shareholders at the Annual General Meeting (AGM) 
in 2015, it will be the subject of a shareholder vote at the AGM 
in May 2018. In carrying out the Policy review during the year, the 
Committee was mindful of the need to consider further simplification, 
improved alignment with our strategy and evolving stakeholder views 
on executive pay. 
Set out over the following pages is the Policy that will take legal effect 
from the conclusion of the 2018 AGM, subject to shareholder approval.
Executive Directors’ remuneration
The Committee believes that the remuneration arrangements 
are aligned with the organisation’s strategic goals as well as the 
experience and expectation of shareholders. 
The revised Policy more closely aligns the interests of the Executive 
Directors (Executives) with the delivery of long-term shareholder 
value through returns and growth whilst ensuring behaviours remain 
consistent with the governance and values of the business.
Objectives
The Policy aims to deliver remuneration arrangements that:
• attract and retain high calibre Executives in a challenging 
and competitive global business environment;
• place strong emphasis on both short-term and long-term 
performance;
• are strongly aligned to the achievement of strategic objectives 
and the delivery of sustainable long-term shareholder value 
through returns and growth; and
• seek to avoid creating excessive risks in the achievement of 
performance targets. 
Remuneration framework
The design of the remuneration framework for Executives ensures 
that a substantial portion of the maximum opportunity is dependent 
upon performance and delivered in shares over a three-five year period. 
Total remuneration comprises fixed pay and variable performance-
related pay, which is further divided into short-term incentive 
(with a one-year performance period) and long-term incentive 
(with a three-year performance period). 
Fixed remuneration includes base salary, benefits and pension. 
Short-term incentive is delivered through the Annual Incentive Plan 
(AIP) which is described on page 92. Long-term incentive is delivered 
through the Long Term Incentive Plan (LTIP) which is described on 
page 92. Both plans are underpinned by stretching performance 
measures and targets that closely link to our strategy. 
Performance measures 
The Committee believes that the performance measures selected 
will help drive our customer-focused strategy, allowing us to deliver 
for our customers, our employees and our shareholders. 
How the LTIP measures link to our strategy

Base pay/salary 
Reflects the scope and 
responsibility of the role 
and the skills and 
experience of the 
individual.
Salaries are set at a level 
sufficient for the Group 
to compete for 
international talent and 
to attract and retain 
Executives of the calibre 
required to develop and 
deliver our strategy.
Base salaries are reviewed annually, taking into 
account individual and business performance, 
market conditions and pay in the Group as 
a whole. Changes are usually effective from 
1 April each year.
Ordinarily, base salary 
increases in percentage terms 
will be in line with increases 
awarded to other employees of 
the Group.
Increases may be made above 
this level to take account of 
individual circumstances such 
as a change in responsibility, 
progression/development in the 
role or a significant increase in 
the scale or size of the role. 
The base salary for an 
Executive will not exceed 
£1 million per annum.
This is consistent with the 
previously approved policy.

Short-term 
incentive plan
Designed to incentivise 
and reward the annual 
performance of 
individuals and teams 
in the delivery of short-
term financial and non-
financial metrics.
Performance measures 
are linked to the delivery 
of the Group’s long-term 
financial goals and key 
Group priorities.
In line with the Group’s annual performance 
management process, each Executive has an 
agreed set of stretching individual objectives 
each year.
Following measurement of the individual and 
company financial performance outcome Annual 
Incentive Plan (AIP) awards are made. Half of the 
AIP award is paid in cash. The other half is required 
to be deferred into shares which are held for three 
years, to further align the interests of Executives 
with the long-term interests of shareholders. 
Dividends are payable on the shares during the 
holding period.
If overall business performance is not deemed 
satisfactory, an individual’s AIP payment for the 
year may be reduced or forfeited, at the discretion 
of the Committee.
Malus and clawback apply to the cash and share 
awards (see policy table notes).
Maximum of 200% of base 
salary. Half the maximum is 
payable for on-target 
performance. 
This is consistent with the 
previously approved policy.
75% based on a mix of 
financial performance 
measures aligned to 
Centrica’s priorities for 
the forthcoming year and 
25% based on individual 
objectives aligned to 
the Group’s priorities 
and strategy.
Under the previously 
approved policy, 62.5% 
was based on adjusted 
operating cash flow and 
37 .5% was based on 
individual objectives.
Performance is assessed 
over one financial year.
Long-term  
incentive plan
Designed to retain 
Executives and to 
encourage sustainable 
high performance. 
Provides an incentive 
that aligns with the 
Group’s strategy to 
deliver long-term 
shareholder value 
through returns and 
growth. 
Provides a direct link 
between executive 
remuneration and the 
Group’s long-term 
financial goals and 
priorities.
Long Term Incentive Plan (LTIP) awards are 
granted to Executives each year based on 
a percentage of base salary at the point of award. 
Shares vest at the end of a three-year 
performance period, depending on the 
achievement against the performance targets, but 
are not released until the fifth anniversary of the 
award date.
LTIP awards are usually delivered as conditional 
shares. Awards may also be granted as nil-cost 
options with a seven-year exercise period. It is 
a requirement of the LTIP that the net shares are 
held for a further two years following the vesting 
date. Malus applies to the shares during the three-
year performance period and clawback applies to 
the shares during the two-year holding period (see 
policy table notes).
Dividend equivalents are calculated at the end of 
the performance period on any conditional LTIP 
share awards or nil-cost options. Dividend 
equivalents are paid as additional shares or 
as cash.
If overall performance is not deemed satisfactory, 
the award for any year may be reduced or 
forfeited, at the discretion of the Committee.
Maximum of 300% of base 
salary plus dividend equivalents. 
This is consistent with the 
previously approved policy.
The amount payable for 
achieving the minimum level of 
performance is 5.55% of award. 
Under the previously approved 
policy, the minimum level 
was 0%.
33.3% based on relative 
total shareholder return 
(TSR) with the remainder 
equally weighted and 
based on underlying 
adjusted operating cash 
flow (UAOCF) growth, 
absolute aggregate 
economic profit (EP) and 
non-financial KPIs, all 
measured over a three-year 
performance period.
Under the previously 
approved policy, 
performance measures 
were equally weighted and 
based on earnings per 
share (EPS), absolute 
aggregate EP and non-
financial KPIs, measured 
over a three-year 
performance period.

Pension
Positioned to provide 
a market-competitive 
post-retirement benefit, 
in a way that manages 
the overall cost to the 
Company.
Executives are entitled to participate in a Company 
money purchase pension arrangement or to take 
a fixed salary supplement (calculated as a 
percentage of base salary, which is excluded 
from any bonus calculation) in lieu of pension 
entitlement.
The Group’s policy is not to offer defined benefit 
arrangements to new employees at any level, 
unless this is specifically required by applicable 
legislation or an existing contractual agreement.
For newly recruited Executives 
the maximum benefit is 25% 
of base salary.
For existing Executives 
appointed between 2015 and 
2017 , the maximum benefit 
is 30% of base salary for the 
Group Chief Executive and 
25% of base salary for all 
other Executives.
Not applicable.
Executives appointed prior to 2015 are entitled 
to participate in a Centrica pension arrangement 
or to receive a fixed salary supplement in lieu 
of pension entitlement in accordance with the 
terms of their contracts.
We would only continue to honour defined benefit 
pension arrangements in the event of an individual 
being promoted to the Board who retains a 
contractual entitlement to such benefit.
For Executives appointed prior 
to 2015, the maximum benefit 
is 40% of base salary.
Not applicable.
Benefits
Positioned to support 
health and wellbeing 
and to provide a 
competitive package of 
benefits that is aligned 
with market practice. 
The Group offers Executives a range of benefits 
including some or all of:
• a company-provided car and fuel, or a cash 
allowance in lieu;
• life assurance and personal accident 
insurance;
• health and medical insurance for the 
Executive and their dependants;
• health screening and wellbeing services; and
• a contribution towards financial planning 
advice.
Cash allowance in lieu of 
company car – £22,000 per 
annum.
The benefit in kind value of 
other benefits will not exceed 
5% of base salary.
This is consistent with the 
previously approved Policy.
Not applicable.
Relocation and 
expatriate 
assistance
Enable the Group to 
recruit or promote the 
appropriate individual 
into a role, to retain key 
skills and to provide 
career opportunities.
Assistance may include (but is not limited to) 
removal and other relocation costs, housing or 
temporary accommodation, education, home 
leave, repatriation and tax equalisation.
Maximum of 100% of base 
salary.
This is consistent with the 
previously approved Policy.
Not applicable.
All-employee 
share plans
Provide an opportunity 
for employees to 
voluntarily invest in the 
Company.
Executives are entitled to participate in all-
employee share plans on the same terms as 
all other eligible employees. 
Maximum contribution limits 
are set by legislation or by the 
rules of each plan. Levels of 
participation apply equally to 
all participants. 
This is consistent with the 
previously approved Policy.
Not applicable.
92 | Centrica plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Centrica plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 | 93 Policy table notes
The Committee reserves the right to make any remuneration 
payments and payments for loss of office, notwithstanding that they 
are not in line with the Policy set out on pages 90 to 97 , where the 
terms of the payment were agreed before the Policy came into effect, 
at a time when the relevant individual was not an Executive of the 
Company or, in the opinion of the Committee, the payment was not in 
consideration for the individual becoming an Executive of the Company. 
For these purposes payments include the amounts paid in order to 
satisfy awards of variable remuneration and, in relation to an award 
over shares, the terms of the payment are agreed at the time the 
award is granted.
The Committee may make minor amendments to the Policy set 
out on pages 90 to 97 (for regulatory, exchange control, tax or 
administrative purposes or to take account of a change in legislation) 
without obtaining shareholder approval for that amendment.
Performance measures
We continue to be committed to full transparency and disclosure. 
We will disclose all targets as soon as any commercial sensitivity falls 
away. At the latest, this will be at the end of the performance period.
Relative total shareholder return (TSR)
Compares Centrica’s TSR (share price growth plus dividends) for the 
performance period with the TSR ranking of the other companies in 
the FTSE 100 Index. 
The FTSE 100 Index has been chosen as it is a broad equity index of 
which Centrica is a constituent member and reflects the investment 
interests of our UK shareholder base. 
Underlying adjusted operating cash flow (UAOCF) growth
Growth in net cash flow from operating activities (which includes 
taxes paid) adjusted to include dividends received from joint ventures 
and associates and to exclude payments relating to exceptional 
items, UK defined benefit pension deficit contributions and movements 
in variation margin and cash collateral that are included in net debt.
This is adjusted for the impact of commodity price movements 
in Exploration & Production/nuclear, foreign exchange movements 
and any material one-off working capital items to give a measure 
of underlying growth.
Economic profit (EP)
EP is adjusted operating profit (after share of joint venture interest) 
less a tax charge based on the tax rate relevant to the different 
business segments and after deduction of a capital charge. 
The capital charge is calculated as capital employed multiplied 
by the Group’s weighted average cost of capital.
Further details of these performance measures are provided in notes 
2, 4 and 10 of the Financial Statements, in the Annual Report and 
Accounts 2017 . In addition, see page 216 for an explanation of UAOCF .
Non-financial KPIs
Based on the Group’s non-financial KPIs, using three-year targets for 
improvement. 
Malus and clawback
The Committee can apply malus (that is reduce the number of shares 
in respect of which an award vests) or delay the vesting of awards if 
it considers it appropriate where a participant has engaged in gross 
misconduct or displayed inappropriate management behaviour which 
fails to reflect the governance and values of the business or where 
the results for any period have been restated or appear inaccurate 
or misleading.
Where an award has vested, the resulting shares will generally 
be held for a period during which they may be subject to clawback 
in the event that the Committee determines that one or more of the 
circumstances above has occurred.
Pension arrangements applying to Executives
Centrica Unfunded Pension Scheme (CUPS)
All registered scheme benefits are subject to HMRC guidelines and 
the Lifetime Allowance.
The CUPS defined contribution (DC) section provides benefits 
for individuals not eligible to join the CUPS defined benefit (DB) 
section and for whom registered scheme benefits are expected 
to exceed the Lifetime Allowance. The CUPS DC section is offered 
as a direct alternative to a cash salary supplement.
The CUPS DB section was closed to new members in October 2002.
CUPS is unfunded but the benefits are secured by a charge over 
certain Centrica assets. An appropriate provision in respect of the 
accrued value of these benefits has been made in the Company’s 
balance sheet.
 
Governance | Remuneration Policy
94 | Centrica plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Centrica plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 | 95
Remuneration Policy (continued) Total remuneration by performance scenario
The charts below indicate the minimum, on-target and maximum 
remuneration that could be received by each Executive, excluding 
share price movement, under the Policy. Assumptions made for each 
scenario are:
• minimum – fixed remuneration only (base salary at current level, 
together with pension and benefits as set out in the Remuneration 
Policy table);
• on-target – fixed remuneration plus target AIP (as set out in the 
Remuneration Policy table) and expected value under the LTIP 
on vesting of 50%; and
• maximum – fixed remuneration plus maximum AIP opportunity 
and maximum levels of vesting under the LTIP (as set out in the 
Remuneration Policy table).
Discretion and judgement
It is important that the Committee maintains the flexibility to apply 
discretion and judgement to achieve fair outcomes as no 
remuneration policy and framework, however carefully designed and 
implemented, can pre-empt every possible scenario. The Committee 
needs to be able to exercise appropriate discretion to determine 
whether mechanistic or formulaic outcomes are fair, in context and 
can be applied in an upward or downward manner when required. 
Judgement is applied appropriately by the Committee, for example 
when considering the political and social pressures on the business, 
the impact of significant movements in external factors such as 
commodity prices, in setting and evaluating delivery against individual 
and non-financial performance targets to ensure they are considered 
sufficiently stretching and that the maximum and minimum levels are 
appropriate and fair.
The Committee has absolute discretion to decide who receives 
awards, the level of the awards under the incentive plans and the 
timing, within the parameters set in the rules.
In the case of a corporate action, the Committee can agree when 
a corporate action applies to a share award, whether awards pay out 
or are rolled over in this situation and how any special dividend might 
apply. The Committee also maintains the discretion to adjust any 
awards in the event of a variation of capital, for example to maintain 
the incentive value at the level originally intended.
The Committee retains discretion, consistent with market practice, 
regarding the operation and administration of the incentive plans 
including, but not limited to, the following:
• agreeing appropriate measures and setting targets aligned to the 
Group’s priorities or KPIs;
• determination of the result of any disputes relating to the 
interpretation of the rules;
• alteration of the terms of the performance targets if it feels that 
they are no longer a fair measure of the Company’s performance, 
as long as the new targets are not materially less challenging than 
the original ones; and
• determination that any award is forfeit in whole or in part.
The Committee also retains the discretion to forfeit or clawback 
deferred awards if it determines that prior performance which 
resulted in the annual bonus being awarded was discovered to 
be a misrepresentation of results or inappropriate management 
behaviour which fails to reflect the governance or values of 
the business.

94 | Centrica plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Centrica plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 | 95 Recruitment policy
The Committee will apply the same remuneration policy during the 
policy period as that which applies to existing Executives when 
considering the recruitment of a new Executive in respect of all 
elements of remuneration as set out in the Remuneration Policy table.
Whilst the maximum level of remuneration which may be granted 
would be within plan rules and ordinarily subject to the maximum 
opportunity set out in the Remuneration Policy table, in certain 
circumstances, an arrangement may be established specifically to 
facilitate recruitment of a particular individual up to 25% above the 
maximum opportunity, albeit that any such arrangement would be 
made within the context of minimising the cost to the Company. 
The policy for the recruitment of Executives during the policy period 
includes the opportunity to provide a level of compensation for 
forfeiture of bonus entitlements and/or unvested long-term incentive 
awards from an existing employer, if any, and the additional provision 
of benefits in kind, pensions and other allowances, as may be 
required in order to achieve a successful recruitment.
Service contracts 
Service contracts provide that either the Executive or the Company 
may terminate the employment by giving one year’s written notice. 
The Committee retains a level of flexibility, as permitted by the Code, 
in order to attract and retain suitable candidates. It reserves the right 
to offer contracts which contain an initial notice period in excess of 
one year, provided that at the end of the first such period the notice 
period reduces to one year.
All Executive and Non-Executive Directors are required to be 
re-elected at each AGM.
Termination policy
The Committee carefully considers compensation commitments in 
the event of an Executive’s termination. The aim is to avoid rewarding 
poor performance and to reduce compensation to reflect the departing 
Executive’s obligations and to mitigate losses.
Save for summary dismissal, the policy is to either continue to provide 
base salary, pension and other benefits for any unworked period of 
notice or, at the option of the Company, to make a payment in lieu 
of notice comprising base salary only. Typically any payment in lieu 
of notice will be made in monthly instalments and reduce, or cease 
completely, in the event that remuneration from new employment 
is received. 
An AIP award for the year in which the termination occurs may be 
made following the normal year end assessment process, subject 
to achievement of the agreed performance measures and time-
apportioned for the period worked. Any award would be payable at 
the normal time with a 50% deferral and no new long-term incentive 
plan awards would be made.
Except in cases of death in service, the policy is not to vest any 
existing long-term incentive plan awards earlier than their normal 
vesting date. In all cases any vesting remains subject to satisfaction 
of the associated performance conditions and will be time-
apportioned for the period worked.
Executives leaving following resignation will forfeit any potential AIP 
award for the performance year in which the resignation occurs and 
all unvested LTIP awards. In addition, Executives summarily dismissed 
will also forfeit any deferred shares. Deferred awards can also be 
clawed back if it is subsequently discovered that the results have 
been achieved by behaviour which fails to reflect the governance and 
values of the business or where the results for any period appear 
inaccurate or misleading.
On a change of control, existing LTIP awards will be exchanged on 
similar terms or vest to the extent that the performance conditions 
have been met at the date of the event and be time-apportioned to 
the date of the event or the vesting date, subject to the overriding 
discretion of the Committee.
Pay fairness across the Group
The Group operates in a number of different environments and 
has many employees who carry out a range of diverse roles across 
a number of countries. In consideration of pay fairness across 
the Group, the Committee believes that ratios related to market 
competitive pay for each role profile in each distinct geography are 
the most helpful.
When the ratio of salary to the relevant market median is compared 
for all permanent employees across the Group the median ratio is 
0.98. The 25th percentile is 0.96 and the 75th percentile is 1.09.
Unlike the significant majority of the workforce who receive largely 
fixed remuneration, mainly in the form of salary, the most significant 
component of Executive compensation is variable and dependent 
on performance. As such, the Committee reviews total compensation 
for Executives against benchmarks rather than salary alone. The ratio 
of on-target total pay opportunity for the Group Chief Executive 
versus the relevant market median is 0.99.
A number of performance-related incentive schemes are operated 
across the Group which differ in terms of structure and metrics from 
those applying to Executives.
The Group also offers a number of all-employee share schemes in 
the UK, Ireland and North America and Executives participate on the 
same basis as other eligible employees.
Performance measures applying to Executives are cascaded down 
through the organisation and Group employment conditions include 
high standards of health and safety and employee wellbeing initiatives.
No consultation in respect of Executive remuneration takes place 
with employees during the year.
Shareholding requirement
A minimum shareholding requirement is in place for Executive 
Directors to build and maintain a value of shares over a five-year 
period equal to 300% of base salary, with a condition that 75% 
of vested incentive shares (post-tax) will be retained until the 
requirement has been met.
A post-cessation shareholding requirement of 50% of the 
shareholding requirement (or full actual holding if lower) is applicable 
for 24 months post-cessation.
External appointments of Executives
It is the Company’s policy to allow each Executive to accept one 
non-executive directorship of another company, although the Board 
retains the discretion to vary this policy.
Fees received in respect of external appointments are retained 
by the individual Executive and are set out in the Directors’ Annual 
Remuneration Report each year.

to support the delivery of our strategy. 
Terms of appointment
Non-Executives, including the Chairman, do not have service contracts. Their appointments are subject to Letters of Appointment and the 
Articles of Association. All Non-Executives are required to be re-elected at each AGM.

Non-Executives are paid a base fee for their 
services. Where individuals serve as Chairman of 
a Committee of the Board, additional fees are 
payable. The Senior Independent Director also 
receives an additional fee.
Fee levels applying from 1 January 2016 
Chairman of the Board – £495,000 per annum.
Base fee for Non-Executives – £72,500 per annum.
The following additional fees apply:
• Chairman of Audit Committee – £25,000

• Chairman of Remuneration Committee – 
£20,000 per annum;
• Chairman of Safety, Health, Environment, 
Security and Ethics Committee – £20,000 
per annum; and
• Senior Independent Director – £20,000 
per annum.
The Company reserves the right to pay a 
Committee membership fee in addition to the 
base fees.
Non-Executives are able to use 50% of their fees, 
after appropriate payroll withholdings, to purchase 
Centrica shares. Dealing commission and stamp 
duty is paid by the Non-Executive.
The Non-Executives, including the Chairman, 
do not participate in any of the Company’s share 
schemes, incentive plans or pension schemes.
Non-Executives will be reimbursed for business 
expenses relating to the performance of their 
duties including travel, accommodation and 
subsistence. In certain circumstances these, 
or other incidental items, may be considered 
a ‘benefit in kind’ and if so may be grossed up 
for any tax due.
The maximum level of fees 
payable to Non-Executives, in 
aggregate, is set out in the 
Articles of Association.
Not applicable.
Recruitment policy
The policy on the recruitment of new Non-Executives during the policy period would be to apply the same remuneration elements as for the 
existing Non-Executives. It is not intended that variable pay, day rates or benefits in kind be offered, although in exceptional circumstances 
such remuneration may be required in currently unforeseen circumstances. The Committee will include in future Remuneration Reports details 
of the implementation of the policy as utilised during the policy period in respect of any such recruitment to the Board.

Employment policies
Employee involvement
We remain committed to employee involvement throughout the 
business. Employees are kept well informed of the performance and 
strategy of the Group through personal briefings, regular meetings, 
email and broadcasts by the Group Chief Executive and members 
of the Board at key points in the year.
The Company’s all-employee share schemes are a long-established 
and successful part of our total reward package, encouraging and 
supporting employee share ownership. We offer tax-advantaged 
Sharesave (SAYE) schemes in the UK and Ireland, and a Share 
Incentive Plan (SIP) in the UK, with good levels of take-up for all 
share plans across the Group. Currently, 50% of eligible employees 
participate in Sharesave, 31% of eligible employees participate in 
the SIP.
Equal opportunities
The Group is committed to an active equal opportunities policy from 
recruitment and selection, through training and development, 
performance reviews and promotion to retirement. It is our policy to 
promote an environment free from discrimination, harassment and 
victimisation, where everyone receives equal treatment regardless of 
gender, colour, ethnic or national origin, disability, age, marital status, 
sexual orientation or religion. All decisions relating to employment 
practices will be objective, free from bias and based solely upon work 
criteria and individual merit.

Employees with disabilities
It is our policy that people with disabilities should have full and fair 
consideration for all vacancies. During the year we continued to 
demonstrate our commitment to interviewing those people with 
disabilities who fulfil the minimum criteria and we endeavour to 
retain employees in the workforce if they become disabled during 
employment. This commitment was recognised in January 2018 
by our achievement of level 1 Disability Confident Status and in 2017 
we launched a Disability and Wellbeing Network to help employees 
impacted by disability to access the support they need to thrive 
at work.
Human rights
As an international company we have a responsibility and are 
committed to uphold and protect the human rights of individuals 
working for us in the communities and societies where we operate. 
We take steps to ensure that our people working in countries with 
a high risk to human rights are safeguarded, as set out in Our Code. 
We also recognise the opportunity we have to contribute positively to 
global efforts to ensure human rights are understood and observed.

Political donations
Centrica operates on a politically neutral basis. No political donations 
were made by the Group for political purposes during the year. 
However, in accordance with the United States Federal Election 
Campaign Act, a Political Action Committee (PAC) called Direct 
Energy Employee Political Action Committee (DEEPAC) was formed 
to facilitate voluntary political contributions by its US employees. 
DEEPAC is controlled by neither Centrica nor Direct Energy but 
instead by a governing board of individual employee members of

Other Statutory Information Engagement with shareholders
The Board recognises and values the importance of maintaining an 
effective investor relations and communication programme. The 
Board is proactive in obtaining an understanding of shareholder 
views on a number of key matters affecting the Group and receives 
formal investor feedback regularly.
In 2017 , Centrica’s shareholder engagement programme included:
• formal presentations for the announcement of the Group’s 2016 
preliminary results, 2017 interim results and Capital Markets Day;
• meetings between the Group Chief Executive and Group Chief 
Financial Officer and the Company’s major shareholders during 
the year;
• the Chairman of the Remuneration Committee meeting with a 
number of the Company’s major shareholders during the year to 
discuss the Company’s remuneration arrangements;
• the Chairman and Senior Independent Director meeting with 
major institutional shareholders in order to gain a first-hand 
understanding of their concerns and key issues and provide 
regular updates of these to the Board; and
• a meeting with our largest investors and leading proxy advisers to 
provide insight into the key focus and considerations of the Board 
and its Committees and a better understanding of the governance 
measures operating across the business.
The Company’s AGM provides all shareholders with the opportunity 
to further develop their understanding of the Company. Shareholders 
can ask questions of the full Board on the matters put to the meeting, 
including the Annual Report and Accounts 2017 and the running 
of the Company generally. The Company intends to send the Notice 
of AGM and any related papers to shareholders at least 20 working 
days before the meeting. All Directors, including Committee Chairmen, 
are due to be in attendance at the AGM to take questions.
At the AGM, the Chairman and the Group Chief Executive present 
a review of the Group’s business. A poll is conducted on each 
resolution at all Company general meetings. All shareholders 
have the opportunity to cast their votes in respect of proposed 
resolutions by proxy, either electronically or by post. Following the 
AGM, the voting results for each resolution are published and are 
available on our website.
Stephen Hester, the Senior Independent Director, is available to 
shareholders if they have concerns that contact through the normal 
channels has failed to resolve.

the Trustees shall vote in accordance with participants’ instructions. 
In the absence of any instruction, the Trustees shall not vote.
Significant agreements – change of control
There are a number of agreements to which the Company is party 
that take effect, alter or terminate upon a change of control of the 
Company following a takeover bid. The significant agreement of this 
kind relates to 2009, when Centrica entered into certain transactions 
with EDF Group in relation to an investment in the former British 
Energy Group, which owned and operated a fleet of nuclear power 
stations in the UK. The transactions include rights for EDF Group and 
Centrica to offtake power from these nuclear power stations. As part 
of the arrangements, on a change of control of Centrica, the Group 
loses its right to participate on the boards of the companies in which 
it has invested. Furthermore, where the acquirer is not located in 
certain specified countries, EDF Group is able to require Centrica to 
sell out its investments to EDF Group.
Sustainability
Information about the Company’s approach to sustainability risks 
and opportunities is set out on pages 32 to 38. Also included in these

Disclosures required under Listing Rule 9.8.4R
The Company is required to disclose certain information under 
Listing Rule 9.8.4R in the Directors’ Report or advise where such 
relevant information is contained. All such disclosures are included 
in this Directors and Corporate Governance Report, other than the 
following sections of the Annual Report and Accounts 2017:

Going concern
Accounting standards require that Directors satisfy themselves that 
it is reasonable for them to conclude whether it is appropriate to 
prepare the Financial Statements on a going concern basis. The 
Group’s business activities, together with factors that are likely to 
affect its future development and position, are set out in the Group 
Chief Executive’s statement on pages 6 to 9 and the Business 
Reviews on pages 40 to 47 . After making enquiries, the Board has 
a reasonable expectation that Centrica plc and the Group as a whole 
have adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the 
foreseeable future. For this reason, the Board continues to adopt the 
going concern basis in preparing the Financial Statements. Further 
details of the Group’s liquidity position are provided in notes 24 and 
S3 to the Financial Statements.
Directors’ responsibilities statement
The Directors, who are named on pages 64 to 65, are responsible for 
preparing the Annual Report, the Remuneration Report, the Strategic 
Report and the Financial Statements in accordance with applicable 
law and regulations.
Company law requires the Directors to prepare financial statements 
for each financial year. Accordingly, the Directors have prepared the 
Group Financial Statements in accordance with International 
Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted by the European 
Union (EU) and have elected to prepare the Company Financial 
Statements in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted 
Accounting Practice including FRS 101 ‘Reduced Disclosure 
Framework’ (United Kingdom Accounting Standards and applicable 
law). Under company law, the Directors must not approve the 
Financial Statements unless they are satisfied that they give a true 
and fair view of the state of affairs of the Group and the Company and 
of the profit or loss of the Group for that period. In preparing these 
Financial Statements, the Directors are required to:
• select suitable accounting policies and then apply them 
consistently;
• make judgements and accounting estimates that are reasonable 
and prudent;
• state whether IFRS as adopted by the EU and applicable UK 
Accounting Standards have been followed, subject to any material 
departures disclosed and explained in the Group and Company 
Financial Statements respectively; and 
• prepare the Financial Statements on the going concern basis 
unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Company will 
continue in business.
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting 
records that are sufficient to show and explain the Company’s 
transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the 
financial position of the Company and the Group and enable them to 
ensure that the Financial Statements and the Remuneration Report 
comply with the Act and, as regards the Group Financial Statements, 
Article 4 of the IAS Regulation. They are also responsible for 
safeguarding the assets of the Company and the Group and hence 
for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud 
and other irregularities.
Furthermore, the Directors are responsible for the maintenance and 
integrity of the Company’s website. Legislation in the UK governing 
the preparation and dissemination of financial statements may differ 
from legislation in other jurisdictions.
The Directors consider that the Annual Report and Accounts 2017 , 
when taken as a whole, is fair, balanced and understandable and 
provides the information necessary for shareholders to assess the 
Group’s position and performance, business model and strategy.
Each of the Directors confirm that to the best of their knowledge:
• the Group Financial Statements, which have been prepared 
in accordance with IFRS as adopted by the EU, give a true and fair 
view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and profit or loss of 
the Group;
• the Strategic Report contained on pages 2 to 62 together with the 
Directors’ and Corporate Governance Report on pages 63 to 100, 
includes a fair review of the development and performance of the 
business and the position of the Group, together with a description 
of the principal risks and uncertainties that it faces;
• as outlined on page 73, there is no relevant audit information of 
which Deloitte LLP are unaware; and
• they have taken all the steps that they ought to have taken as 
a Director in order to make themselves aware of any relevant audit 
information and to establish that the Company’s auditors are 
aware of that information.

Opinion
In our opinion:
• the Financial Statements give a true and fair view of the state 
of the Group’s and of the Company’s affairs as at 31 December 
2017 and of the Group’s profit for the year then ended;
• the Group Financial Statements have been properly prepared 
in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards 
(IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union;
• the Company Financial Statements have been properly prepared 
in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted 
Accounting Practice including Financial Reporting Standard 101 
‘Reduced Disclosure Framework’; and
• the Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with 
the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 and, as regards the 
Group Financial Statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation.
We have audited the Financial Statements of Centrica plc 
(the ‘Company’) and its subsidiaries (the ‘Group’) which comprise:
• the Group Income Statement;
• the Group Statement of Comprehensive Income;
• the Group Balance Sheet; 
• the Company Balance Sheet;
• the Group Statement of Changes in Equity;
• the Company Statement of Changes in Equity;
• the Group Cash Flow Statement; and
• related notes on pages 115 to 200 which include the summary 
of accounting policies.
The financial reporting framework that has been applied in the 
preparation of the Group Financial Statements is applicable law and 
IFRSs as adopted by the European Union. The financial reporting 
framework that has been applied in the preparation of the Company 
Financial Statements is applicable law and United Kingdom 
Accounting Standards, including FRS 101 ‘Reduced Disclosure 
Framework’ (United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting 
Practice).
Basis for opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards 
on Auditing (UK) (ISAs (UK)) and applicable law. Our responsibilities 
under those standards are further described in the Auditor’s 
responsibilities for the audit of the Financial Statements section 
of our report. 
We are independent of the Group and the Company in accordance 
with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the 
Financial Statements in the UK, including the FRC’s Ethical Standard 
as applied to listed public interest entities, and we have fulfilled our 
other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements. 
We confirm that the non-audit services prohibited by the FRC’s 
Ethical Standard were not provided to the Group or the Company.
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient 
and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.
Summary of our audit approach
Key audit matters The key audit matters that we identified in the current year were:
• impairment assessment for long-life assets and goodwill; 
• estimation of energy supply revenue; 
• valuation of commodity trades; 
• presentation of exceptional items and certain re-measurements; and 
• accounting for the acquisition of the Bayerngas exploration and production assets.
Key audit matters considered by the Group’s auditor in the prior year were broadly aligned with the items identified 
above, but also included consideration of onerous contracts (which are less significant in the current year with no 
new contracts considered to be onerous) and pensions (which while material, we do not consider to be a key audit 
matter as the assumptions have not changed materially in the current year). Accounting for the acquisition of 
Bayerngas Norge AS’s exploration and production business was not relevant in the prior year.
Materiality
£50 million
The materiality that we used in the current year was £50 million which was determined on the basis of 5.5% profit 
before tax before exceptional items and certain re-measurements as defined in note 7 .
Scoping
All segments in full scope
All divisions of the Group have been subject to a full scope audit using a component materiality level relevant 
to the size and risk associated with that business. The decision to include all divisions in our full audit scope was 
to enhance our understanding of the Group and ensure that our audit was appropriately scoped in our first year 
as auditor. 
First year audit transition
We have completed a smooth 
and effective transition
We developed a detailed audit transition plan, designed to deliver an effective transition from the Group’s 
predecessor auditor, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP (‘PwC’). Our audit planning and transition commenced on 
1 January 2017 , when we confirmed our independence to the Group’s Audit Committee. Our transition activities 
were performed across the Group’s business divisions, which included (but were not limited to) meeting relevant 
partners and senior staff from PwC, shadowing PwC in the 2016 audit close meetings, attending the February 
2017 Audit Committee meeting where the final report on the audit was presented and reviewing PwC’s 2016 
audit work papers. In March 2017 , we held an audit transition planning workshop with senior members of our 
component teams in order to design our audit strategy and approach. Senior management relevant to the audit also 
participated in detailed transition workshops involving each division, together with Internal Audit and Group Finance. 
Our transition focused on obtaining an understanding of the Group’s system of internal control, evaluating the 
Group’s accounting policies and areas of accounting judgement and meeting with management across all divisions. 
Independent Auditor’s Report
Financial Statements | Independent Auditor’s Report
102 | Centrica plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Conclusions relating to principal risks, going concern and viability statement
Going concern
We have reviewed the Directors’ statement on page 100 of the Financial 
Statements about whether they considered it appropriate to adopt the going 
concern basis of accounting in preparing them and their identification of any 
material uncertainties to the Group’s and Company’s ability to continue to 
do so over a period of at least 12 months from the date of approval of the 
Financial Statements.
We are required to state whether we have anything material to add or draw 
attention to in relation to that statement required by Listing Rule 9.8.6R(3) 
and report if the statement is materially inconsistent with our knowledge 
obtained in the audit.
We confirm that we have nothing material to report, add or draw 
attention to in respect of these matters.
Principal risks and viability statement
Based solely on reading the Directors’ statements and considering whether 
they were consistent with the knowledge we obtained in the course of the 
audit, including the knowledge obtained in the evaluation of the Directors’ 
assessment of the Group’s and the Company’s ability to continue as a going 
concern, we are required to state whether we have anything material to add 
or draw attention to in relation to:
• the disclosures on pages 52 to 60 that describe the principal risks 
and explain how they are being managed or mitigated;
• the Directors’ confirmation on pages 55 and 100 that they have carried 
out a robust assessment of the principal risks facing the Group, 
including those that would threaten its business model, future 
performance, solvency or liquidity; or
• the Directors’ explanation on pages 61 and 62 as to how they have 
assessed the prospects of the Group, over what period they have 
done so and why they consider that period to be appropriate, and their 
statement as to whether they have a reasonable expectation that the 
Group will be able to continue in operation and meet its liabilities as 
they fall due over the period of their assessment, including any related 
disclosures drawing attention to any necessary qualifications or 
assumptions.
We are also required to report whether the Directors’ statement relating to 
the prospects of the Group required by Listing Rule 9.8.6R(3) is materially 
inconsistent with our knowledge obtained in the audit.
We confirm that we have nothing material to report, add or draw 
attention to in respect of these matters.
Key audit matters
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement, were of most significance in our audit of the Financial Statements 
of the current period and include the most significant assessed risks of material misstatement (whether or not due to fraud) that we 
identified. These matters included those which had the greatest effect on: the overall audit strategy, the allocation of resources in the 
audit and directing the efforts of the engagement team.
These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the Financial Statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, 
and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.
Centrica plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 | 103 Key audit matter description
How the scope of our audit responded  
to the key audit matter
Impairment assessment for long-life assets and goodwill
The Group owns significant upstream gas and oil assets, certain power 
generation assets and gas storage assets, and also recognises goodwill 
from historic acquisitions, which are required to be reviewed for indicators 
of impairment or tested at least annually for impairment as appropriate. 
The impairment assessment involves management judgement in 
considering whether the carrying value of those assets or cash generating 
units are recoverable. 
Determining the recoverable amount involves significant estimation 
including:
• forecasting future cash flows;
• forecasting future production or generation profiles;
• forecasting future commodity prices;
• estimating oil and gas reserves; and 
• determining an appropriate discount rate. 
We note that the Group’s impairment tests are particularly sensitive to future 
commodity price assumptions and discount rates, as shown by the 
sensitivities disclosed in note 7(c). 
As disclosed in notes 13, 14 and 15 the total book value of long-life assets 
and goodwill is £10.2 billion and following management’s impairment testing 
a total impairment of £678 million was recorded. See note 3(b) for further 
details of the specific assets subject to key estimation uncertainty and notes 
7(c) and S2 for details of other key assumptions used in estimating fair value 
less costs of disposal for these assets. 
Due to the significance of the judgements and estimates involved in 
determining the recoverable amount, those assets that are the most material 
and subject to the greatest estimation were concluded to represent the 
highest risk of impairment, as explained in note 3(b) and specified above. 
For these long-life assets and goodwill, we identified a key risk of material 
misstatement that these assets are not recoverable or that previously 
recorded impairments should be reversed.
Refer to pages 74 to 75 for the Audit Committee’s review and conclusion 
of the key judgements underpinning the impairment assessment. 
We understood management’s process for identifying indicators of 
impairment and for performing their impairment assessment. We assessed 
the design and implementation of key controls relating to asset impairment 
models, the underlying forecasting processes and the impairment reviews 
performed.
We evaluated and challenged the key assumptions and inputs into 
the impairment models which included performing sensitivity analysis, 
to evaluate the impact of selecting alternative assumptions. 
We confirmed that forecast cash flows were consistent with Board approved 
forecasts and analysed reasonably possible downside sensitivities. 
We validated production profiles to external reserve and operator estimates 
and agreed these to the cash flow forecast assumptions.
We evaluated the Group’s determination of future commodity prices using 
our own internal experts, who benchmarked externally available future 
commodity price estimates and performed sensitivity analysis with 
alternative future prices. 
We confirmed estimates of oil and gas reserves to third-party reserve reports, 
assessing the skills, qualifications and independence of these experts. 
We involved our internal valuation specialists to evaluate management’s 
discount rates, which involved benchmarking against available market views 
and analysis.
We evaluated the impairment or reversal judgements taken, with reference 
to our assessment of key assumptions as outlined above and the outcome 
of sensitivities performed. For potential reversal judgements, we understood 
the causes of any such reversal, and corroborated this to evidence of trigger 
events, and evaluated whether the reversal should or should not be 
recognised.
We audited the integrity of the impairment models and cash flow forecasts 
to test arithmetical accuracy. We recalculated the impairment charges, 
reversals or headroom and agreed to financial records. We reviewed the 
impairment disclosures against the requirements of IAS 36 ‘Impairment 
of Assets’.
We reviewed the presentation and disclosure of management’s impairment 
assessment in the Financial Statements to assess whether the disclosure 
is consistent with the Group’s policy and relevant accounting standards.
Key observations
We are satisfied that key assumptions used to determine the recoverable amount are appropriate, including estimates of reserves, production and 
generation profiles, and that the Group’s discount rate assumptions are determined based on acceptable valuation methodologies and are reasonable 
when compared to the ranges determined by our internal valuation specialists. 
We note that the Group’s future commodity price estimates used for the impairment assessment are within the acceptable range of external sources, albeit 
at the higher end of this range. Based on the sensitivities that we performed on these assumptions, we are satisfied that the Group’s pre-tax impairment 
charge of £678 million is not materially misstated, and long-life assets and goodwill are not further impaired. We concur with management’s judgement that 
other than those reversals recognised, previously recorded impairments should not be reversed at this time.
Financial Statements | Independent Auditor’s Report
104 | Centrica plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Independent Auditor’s Report (continued) Key audit matter description
How the scope of our audit responded  
to the key audit matter
Estimation of energy supply revenue
The recognition of energy supply revenue requires an estimation of 
customer usage between the date of the last meter reading and year end, 
known as unbilled revenue. There is particular uncertainty over estimating 
consumption arising from unusual weather patterns. Unbilled revenue 
recognised on the balance sheet at 31 December 2017 was £1.6 billion 
per note 3(b).
Our risk is focused on the accuracy, completeness and cut off of unbilled 
revenue, and the valuation of unbilled receivables in the UK and North 
American Home and Business segments. 
We are required by auditing standards to presume there is a fraud risk 
in relation to revenue recognition, which we have pinpointed to the estimates 
underpinning the recognition of unbilled energy supply revenue and the 
potential for management override of related controls. 
Refer to page 74 for the Audit Committee’s review and conclusion of the key 
judgements included within unbilled revenue and notes 3(b) and 17 to the 
Financial Statements.
Our audit approach for unbilled revenue was a combination of tests of 
internal control and data analytics work. This included understanding the 
design of controls in the UK and North American revenue processes, 
from meter to cash collection and controls over the period-end revenue 
reconciliation process. In the UK, we tested the design, implementation 
and operating effectiveness of key controls relied on to estimate unbilled 
revenue. In North America, we assessed the design and implementation 
of controls around unbilled revenue. 
We used data analytic tools in UK Home and Business to independently 
recalculate the unbilled revenue estimate generated by the billing systems 
for each customer account, in addition to auditing key manual adjustments 
made by management, and the key assumption, being the value of energy 
consumed since last billing used in the estimation process. 
In our North America testing, we focused on creating an independent 
estimate of unbilled revenue at the year end and compared this to the 
estimate determined by management. We also performed a look-back 
analysis to compare the estimated settlement data against historical results 
and a gross margin analysis to estimate the valuation based on external 
market pricing.
In both the UK and North America, we also assessed the accuracy of the 
estimates made by management in prior periods. Any differences as a result 
of the work performed were investigated and challenged. 
Key observations
We are satisfied that the estimation of the Group’s unbilled revenue is materially correct. The estimation processes in the UK are appropriately controlled, 
but we note that the processes in North America are more manual in nature and we were not able to rely on the operating effectiveness of the relevant 
controls. We note that a reassessment of historical unbilled revenue in North America was identified by management and adjusted in the year, as explained 
in the Group Financial Review and the Audit Committee Report. We did not identify any material errors in the year-end estimate. 
Valuation of commodity trades
In addition to proprietary trading activities, the Group enters into forward 
commodity contracts to optimise the value of its production, generation, 
storage and transportation assets as well as to meet the future needs of its 
customers. Certain of these arrangements are accounted for as derivative 
financial instruments and are recorded at fair value. We identified the 
following risks in respect of commodity trades:
Valuation of complex trades
Judgement is required in valuing derivative contracts, particularly where 
there is optionality in a contract that requires modelling on a bespoke basis 
(Level 2 or 3 in accordance with IFRS 13 ‘Fair Value Measurement’). As such 
we identified a risk relating to the valuation of complex trades.
Own-use treatment
Certain commodity contracts have been entered into for the purposes of 
securing commodity for the energy supply businesses. Where contracts 
have been entered into that wholly satisfy Centrica’s normal business 
activities these have been determined to be own-use contracts and are not 
fair valued. Due to the size and value of these contracts we have identified 
the appropriateness of the own-use treatment as a key audit matter.
We have understood the Group’s processes and controls for authorising 
and recording commodity trades, and assessed the design and 
implementation of key controls. 
In the Group’s Energy Marketing & Trading (EM&T) division, we used data 
analytic tools to trace commodity trades from initiation to recording in the 
Group’s accounting system, which included an assessment of whether 
the accounting recognition was in line with the Group’s accounting policies 
and relevant accounting standards. This confirmed that trades were 
appropriately authorised, controlled and captured within the reporting 
system, and were appropriately and consistently reported in left hand 
column or middle column, in accordance with the Group’s accounting 
policies on certain re-measurements (outlined in note 2(b)). 
Valuation of complex trades
We used financial instrument specialists to assist the audit team in valuing 
complex trades, which included auditing the Group’s valuation models by 
creating an independent valuation, or performing input and output analysis, 
for all material non-standard contracts.
Own-use treatment
We reviewed all the Group’s material own-use contracts to determine 
whether the application of the own-use treatment was appropriate. 
We audited the prospective and retrospective demand tests performed 
by the Group to determine whether the contract volumes exceed the 
amount of estimated own-use demand in the relevant periods, including 
an evaluation of the contracts for net settlement activity. 
Key observations
We are satisfied that commodity trades are valued appropriately.
In EM&T, we are satisfied that the accounting classification of trades is appropriate with trades tagged appropriately at inception. 
In North America Business, we identified improvements to controls over the classification of trades and monitoring of net settlement activity for trades 
deemed to be own-use, which are being remediated. None have resulted in material uncorrected misstatements.

Presentation of exceptional items and certain re-measurements
The selection and presentation of items excluded from adjusted profit 
involves significant management judgement and adjusted results are of 
particular interest to stakeholders. For this reason, we have identified this 
as an area where management would be able to directly influence results.
The Group’s accounting policy for the presentation of exceptional items and 
certain re-measurements is disclosed in note 2(b). As disclosed in note 7 to 
the Financial Statements, exceptional items after taxation of £476 million and 
certain re-measurements after taxation of £69 million have been recognised 
in the current year.
Exceptional items include impairments or write backs on long-life assets, 
gains or losses on business disposals and costs associated with the 
Group’s restructuring programme. 
Where the Group enters into trades that give rise to an accounting mismatch 
between accrual accounted assets, contracts and demand and the marked 
to market accounted forward commodity contracts, the fair values of those 
contracts are accounted for separately as ‘certain re-measurements’ within 
the middle column of the Group’s Income Statement and are excluded from 
business performance. 
Due to the judgement involved in identifying and valuing these contracts, we 
have identified the appropriateness of the allocation of trades to the middle 
column as a key audit matter, as this has a significant impact on the Group’s 
reported business performance. 
There is a risk that adjusted profit measures are misleading and that the 
principles used to determine the classification as exceptional are not in line 
with relevant guidance, substantiated or applied on a consistent basis.
Refer to page 74 for the Audit Committee’s consideration of exceptional 
items and certain re-measurements.
We evaluated the Group’s accounting policy for exceptional items and 
certain re-measurements against guidance issued by the Financial 
Reporting Council (FRC) and European Securities and Markets Authority 
(ESMA) regarding the publication of transparent, unbiased and comparable 
financial information.
We considered management’s rationale for the treatment of exceptional 
items presented and performed our own independent assessment of the 
selection and presentation of each item against the Group’s accounting 
policies and relevant regulatory guidance. We challenged management over 
the principles used to determine items as exceptional, assessing whether 
the application of the Group’s policy was appropriate and consistent.
For certain re-measurements, we audited the principles management use 
to determine whether a trade should be recognised as part of ongoing 
business performance or presented separately. We evaluated whether 
those agreed principles had been applied consistently by reviewing key 
contracts and testing a sample of trades to confirm that the accounting 
treatment was appropriate.
We also verified that trades within certain re-measurements were entered 
into at market prices where the counterparty was another Group business, 
to ensure that profits and losses within the middle column reflect only 
market-related movements.
We reviewed the presentation and disclosure of these items in the Financial 
Statements to assess whether the disclosure is consistent with the Group’s 
policy, in line with FRC and ESMA guidance, and understandable to readers.
Key observations
We are satisfied that the items presented as exceptional and within certain re-measurements in the Financial Statements are in compliance with the Group’s 
accounting policies, which have been applied consistently with prior periods, and are clearly described to readers. 
Accounting for the acquisition of Bayerngas exploration and production assets 
The Group acquired the European exploration and production assets of 
Bayerngas on 8 December 2017 . Accounting for business combinations 
is complex and this transaction involved the acquisition of certain assets 
and liabilities, in return for a share of the Group’s existing Exploration 
& Production assets, together with various complex contractual rights 
between the parties. The acquisition accounting is set out in note 12 and 
total consideration was £745 million with goodwill recognised on acquisition 
of £102 million.
We identified the following risks of material misstatement associated with 
the transaction: 
• accounting for the transaction, including:
 – the assessment of control;
 – the assessment of shares issued as equity or debt instruments;
 – the valuation of consideration contributed and goodwill arising; and
 – the valuation of non-controlling interest.
• the fair valuation of assets acquired in the transaction with Bayerngas, 
which included evaluating reserve estimates, future production profiles 
and commodity prices and the selection of appropriate discount rates; 
and
• the disclosure of the business combination as presented in note 12 
of the Financial Statements.
Refer to page 75 for the Audit Committee’s review of business 
combinations, including the acquisition of Bayerngas Norge AS.
In response to this key audit matter, we assessed the accounting treatment 
for the transaction by reviewing key documents and evaluating the accounting 
judgements against relevant accounting guidance. We have also reviewed 
the disclosures of the business combination provided in note 12. 
We audited the fair valuation of acquired assets and the fair valuation of the 
Group’s existing Exploration & Production assets, which were used to 
determine the consideration value. This involved internal valuation specialists 
in both Norway and the UK.
Given the nature of the fair value exercise, much of this work was consistent 
with our work performed for impairment purposes. Therefore refer to the key 
audit matter for Impairment above regarding our audit of management’s 
discount rate, future commodity prices and estimates of reserves. 
Key observations
We are satisfied that the accounting judgements taken are appropriate and that the fair values adopted are not materially misstated, although we refer to our 
observations on the Group’s future commodity price assumptions outlined in the Impairment matter above. We note that using alternative price assumptions 
would have a significant impact on the valuation of acquired assets and the valuation of consideration payable for those assets. 
Financial Statements | Independent Auditor’s Report
106 | Centrica plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Independent Auditor’s Report (continued) Our application of materiality 
We define materiality as the magnitude of misstatement in the Financial Statements that makes it probable that the economic decisions 
of a reasonably knowledgeable person would be changed or influenced. We use materiality both in planning the scope of our audit work 
and in evaluating the results of our work. 
Based on our professional judgement, we determined materiality for the Financial Statements as a whole as follows:
Materiality £50 million (2016: £59 million)
The materiality for the Company accounts was determined to be £40 million (2016: £53 million), 
capped to be consistent with our highest component materiality.
Basis for determining materiality We determined Group materiality on the basis of 5.5% of 2017 pre-tax profit adjusted for exceptional 
items and certain re-measurements as defined and reconciled in note 7 to the Financial Statements. 
The predecessor auditor used 5% of a three-year average of pre-tax profit adjusted for exceptional 
items and certain re-measurements. 
Rationale for the benchmark applied Pre-tax profit adjusted for exceptional items and certain re-measurements was considered to be the 
most relevant benchmark as it is of most interest to stakeholders. Furthermore exceptional items and 
certain re-measurements are volatile and materially impact the Group’s performance each year due 
to events and transactions that are not part of the underlying activities of the Group and excluding them 
enables a more consistent basis with which to consider the Group’s performance on an ongoing basis.
Reporting threshold We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to the Committee all audit differences 
in excess of £5 million (2016: £5 million), as well as differences below that threshold that, in our view, 
warranted reporting on qualitative grounds. We also report to the Audit Committee on disclosure 
matters that we identified when assessing the overall presentation of the Financial Statements.
An overview of the scope of our audit 
The Group is organised by its different operating segments as 
outlined in note 4. These operating segments represent the different 
businesses in the Group and are how management monitor 
performance. We used the Group’s operating segments as the 
basis for our audit scope. 
Our audit was scoped by obtaining an understanding of the Group 
and its environment, including Group-wide controls, and assessing 
the risks of material misstatement at the Group level. Having 
performed this assessment it was concluded that the following 
components were considered to be the most significant and were 
subject to full scope audits:
• UK Home;
• UK Business;
• North America Home;
• North America Business;
• Energy Marketing & Trading; and
• Exploration & Production.
To enhance our understanding of the Group’s operating segments, 
processes and balances in our first year as auditor, we also decided 
to perform full scope audits for all non-significant segments, being:
• Ireland; 
• Connected Home;
• Distributed Energy & Power; 
• Central Power Generation; and
• Centrica Storage.
This has resulted in coverage of 98% of Group revenue, 91% 
of Group profit before tax and 89% of Group net assets.
The materiality levels of the components ranged from £15 million 
to £40 million depending on the contribution of the component’s 
operations to the Group and our assessment of risk relevant specific 
to each location. Given our judgement to perform full scope audits 
in the non-significant segments noted above, we determined that 
a component materiality of £15 million for these businesses was 
appropriate, which reflected the lower risk profile of these segments. 
All components except for North America Home, North America 
Business and Ireland are audited from the United Kingdom and 
hence we oversee these component audits through regular meetings 
and direct supervision. For the overseas components, each was 
visited several times during both transition and throughout the year 
by the lead audit partner and other senior members of the engagement 
team. All teams were involved in our transition workshops and other 
transition activities, all of which was overseen and directed by the 
Group audit team. Throughout the year, the Group audit team has 
been directly involved in overseeing the component audit planning 
and execution, through frequent conversations, team briefings, 
debate, challenge and review of reporting and underlying work 
papers. In addition to our direct interactions, we sent detailed 
instructions to our component audit teams, attended audit closing 
meetings and reviewed their audit working papers. We are satisfied 
that the level of involvement of the Group audit partner and team 
in the component audits has been extensive and has enabled us 
to conclude that sufficient appropriate audit evidence has been 
obtained in support of our opinion on the Group Financial Statements 
as a whole.
Centrica plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 | 107 Other information
The Directors are responsible for the other information. The other 
information comprises the information included in the Annual Report, 
other than the Financial Statements and our auditor’s report thereon.
Our opinion on the Financial Statements does not cover the other 
information and, except to the extent otherwise explicitly stated in our 
report, we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.
In connection with our audit of the Financial Statements, our 
responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, 
consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent 
with the Financial Statements or our knowledge obtained in the 
audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated.
If we identify such material inconsistencies or apparent material 
misstatements, we are required to determine whether there is a 
material misstatement in the Financial Statements or a material 
misstatement of the other information. If, based on the work we 
have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement 
of this other information, we are required to report that fact.
In this context, matters that we are specifically required to report to 
you as uncorrected material misstatements of the other information 
include where we conclude that:
• fair, balanced and understandable – the statement given by the 
Directors that they consider the Annual Report and Accounts 
taken as a whole is fair, balanced and understandable and provides 
the information necessary for shareholders to assess the Group’s 
performance, business model and strategy, is materially inconsistent 
with our knowledge obtained in the audit; or
•  Audit Committee reporting – the section describing the work 
of the Audit Committee does not appropriately address matters 
communicated by us to the Audit Committee; or
• Directors’ statement of compliance with the UK Corporate 
Governance Code – the parts of the Directors’ statement required 
under the Listing Rules relating to the Company’s compliance 
with the UK Corporate Governance Code containing provisions 
specified for review by the auditor in accordance with Listing Rule 
9.8.10R(2) do not properly disclose a departure from a relevant 
provision of the UK Corporate Governance Code.
We have nothing to report in respect of these matters.
Responsibilities of Directors
As explained more fully in the Directors’ responsibilities statement, 
the Directors are responsible for the preparation of the Financial 
Statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view, 
and for such internal control as the Directors determine is necessary 
to enable the preparation of Financial Statements that are free from 
material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
In preparing the Financial Statements, the Directors are responsible 
for assessing the Group’s and the Company’s ability to continue as 
a going concern, disclosing as applicable, matters related to going 
concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless 
the Directors either intend to liquidate the Group or the Company 
or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.
Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the 
Financial Statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the 
Financial Statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, 
whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that 
includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of 
assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in 
accordance with ISAs (UK) will always detect a material misstatement 
when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are 
considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could 
reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of 
users taken on the basis of these Financial Statements.
A further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the 
Financial Statements is located on the Financial Reporting Council’s 
website at: frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities. This description forms 
part of our Auditor’s Report.
Use of our report
This report is made solely to the Company’s shareholders, as a body, 
in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006. 
Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the 
Company’s shareholders those matters we are required to state to 
them in an auditor’s report and for no other purpose. To the fullest 
extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility 
to anyone other than the Company and the Company’s shareholders 
as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we 
have formed.

Independent Auditor’s Report (continued) Report on other legal and regulatory requirements
Opinions on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006 
In our opinion the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited has been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies 
Act 2006.
In our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of the audit:
• the information given in the Strategic Report and the Directors’ Report for the financial year for which the Financial Statements are

• the Strategic Report and the Directors’ Report have been prepared in accordance with applicable legal requirements.
In the light of the knowledge and understanding of the Group and of the Company and their environment obtained in the course of the audit, 
we have not identified any material misstatements in the Strategic Report or the Directors’ Report.
Matters on which we are required to report by exception
Adequacy of explanations received and accounting records
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if, in our opinion:
• we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit; or
• adequate accounting records have not been kept by the Company, or returns adequate 
for our audit have not been received from branches not visited by us; or
• the Company Financial Statements are not in agreement with the accounting records 
and returns.
We have nothing to report in respect of these matters.
Directors’ remuneration
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are also required to report if in our opinion certain 
disclosures of Directors’ remuneration have not been made or the part of the Directors’ 
Remuneration Report to be audited is not in agreement with the accounting records 
and returns.
We have nothing to report in respect of these matters.
Other matters
Auditor tenure
Following the recommendation of the Audit Committee, we were appointed at the Annual General Meeting on 5 May 2017 to audit the 
Financial Statements for the year ending 31 December 2017 and subsequent financial periods. The period of total uninterrupted engagement 
of the firm is therefore one year.
Consistency of the audit report with the additional report to the Audit Committee
Our audit opinion is consistent with the additional report to the Audit Committee we are required to provide in accordance with ISAs (UK).

information required by statute, accounting standards or 
Listing Rules to explain a particular feature of the 
consolidated Financial Statements. 
The notes to these Financial Statements focus on areas that 
are key to understanding our business. Additional information

1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT NEW ACCOUNTING 
POLICIES AND REPORTING CHANGES 
This section details new accounting standards, amendments
to standards and interpretations, whether these are effective 
in 2017 or later years, and if and how these are expected to 
impact the financial position and performance of the Group. 
The principal accounting policies applied in the preparation of these 
consolidated Financial Statements are set out below and in the 
Supplementary Information (note S2). Unless otherwise stated, these 
policies have been consistently applied to the years presented. 
(a) Basis of preparation 
The consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in 
accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) 
adopted by the European Union (EU) and therefore comply with 
Article 4 of the EU IAS Regulation and those parts of the 
Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting  
under IFRS. 
The consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared on the 
historical cost basis except for: derivative financial instruments, 
available-for-sale financial assets, financial instruments designated at 
fair value through profit or loss on initial recognition, and the assets of 
the Group’s defined benefit pension schemes that have been 
measured at fair value; the liabilities of the Group’s defined benefit 
pension schemes that have been measured using the projected unit 
credit valuation method; and the carrying values of recognised assets 
and liabilities qualifying as hedged items in fair value hedges that 
have been adjusted from cost by the changes in the fair values 
attributable to the risks that are being hedged.  
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRS, as 
adopted by the EU, requires the use of certain critical accounting 
estimates. It requires management to exercise its judgement in the 
process of applying the Group’s accounting policies. The areas 
involving a higher degree of judgement or complexity and areas 
where assumptions and estimates are significant to the consolidated 
Financial Statements are described in notes 2 and 3.  
(b) Standards, amendments and interpretations 
effective or adopted in 2017 
From 1 January 2017, the following standards and amendments 
are effective in the consolidated Financial Statements. Their first 
time adoption did not have a material impact on the consolidated 
Financial Statements. 
● Amendments to IAS 7: ‘Statement of cash flows’ related to the 
disclosure initiative; and 
● Amendments to IAS 12: ‘Income taxes’ related to the recognition 
of deferred tax assets for unrealised losses.  
Annual Improvements to IFRS Standards 2014-2016 Cycle: 
Amendments to IFRS 12: ‘Disclosure of interests in other entities’ 
was endorsed by the EU in February 2018. As the Group did not 
have any assets and liabilities of disposal groups classified as held 
for sale as at 31 December 2017 this would not have affected the 
consolidated Financial Statements. 
(c) Standards and amendments that are issued but 
not yet applied by the Group 
Endorsed by the EU 
The Group has not applied the following standards and 
amendments in the consolidated Group Financial Statements as 
they are not yet effective, although they have been endorsed by the 
EU and will be effective from 1 January 2018, unless otherwise 
indicated: 
● IFRS 9: ‘Financial instruments’; 
● IFRS 15: ‘Revenue from contracts with customers’; 
● Amendments to IFRS 15: ‘Effective date of IFRS 15’;  
● Clarifications to IFRS 15: ‘Revenue from contracts with 
customers’;  
● IFRS 16: ‘Leases’, effective from 1 January 2019; and 
● Annual Improvements to IFRS Standards 2014-2016 Cycle: 
Amendments to IFRS 1: ‘First-time adoption of International 
Financial Reporting Standards’ and IAS 28: ‘Investments in 
associates and joint ventures’. 
Management has established and progressed separate projects  
to oversee the implementation of IFRS 9 and IFRS 15 and further 
details are provided below. 
IFRS 9 
The Group will apply IFRS 9 from 1 January 2018. The 
implementation of IFRS 9 has been split into three parts, 
representing the areas of change from the new financial instrument 
standard. The Group’s assessment of the potential impact is at the 
date of initial application of IFRS 9 (1 January 2018). The full impact 
of adopting IFRS 9 on the Group’s consolidated Financial 
Statements will depend on the financial instruments the Group has 
during 2018, as well as on the economic conditions and 
judgements made as at the 2018 year end. 
Classification and measurement 
IFRS 9 applies one classification approach for all types of financial 
assets. Two criteria are used to determine how financial assets 
should be classified and measured, namely, the entity’s business 
model for the financial assets and the contractual cash flow 
characteristics of the financial assets. IFRS 9 identifies three 
categories of financial assets: amortised cost; fair value through 
other comprehensive income (FVOCI) and; fair value through profit 
or loss (FVTPL). The Group’s business units have reviewed their 
financial instruments under the revised IFRS 9 classification and 
measurement rules. The classification of debt financial instruments, 
predominantly held by Treasury, that are currently classified as 
available-for-sale and measured at FVOCI will be FVTPL under 
IFRS 9. The value of these items can be seen in note S6(a). The 
change in fair value that was recorded in Other Comprehensive 
Income in 2017 in respect of these instruments was £4 million and 
therefore the impact of this change on the Income Statement is not 
expected to be material. The Group’s remaining available-for-sale 
assets are equity instruments and on adoption of IFRS 9 the Group 
intends to elect to measure these at FVOCI. The Group’s other 
financial instruments (both financial assets and financial liabilities) 
are not expected to result in material adjustments on classification 
and measurement under IFRS 9. 
Impairment 
IFRS 9 operates an expected credit loss model rather than an 
incurred credit loss model. Under the impairment approach in IFRS 
9, it is not necessary for a credit event to have occurred before 
credit losses are recognised. Instead, an entity always accounts for 
expected credit losses and changes in those expected credit 
losses. The amounts of expected credit losses should be updated 
at each reporting date. The new impairment model will apply to the  
Financial Statements

Management has established and progressed separate projects  
to oversee the implementation of IFRS 9 and IFRS 15 and further 
details are provided below. 
IFRS 9 
The Group will apply IFRS 9 from 1 January 2018. The 
implementation of IFRS 9 has been split into three parts, 
representing the areas of change from the new financial instrument 
standard. The Group’s assessment of the potential impact is at the 
date of initial application of IFRS 9 (1 January 2018). The full impact 
of adopting IFRS 9 on the Group’s consolidated Financial 
Statements will depend on the financial instruments the Group has 
during 2018, as well as on the economic conditions and 
judgements made as at the 2018 year end. 
Classification and measurement 
IFRS 9 applies one classification approach for all types of financial 
assets. Two criteria are used to determine how financial assets 
should be classified and measured, namely, the entity’s business 
model for the financial assets and the contractual cash flow

1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT NEW ACCOUNTING 
POLICIES AND REPORTING CHANGES 
Group’s financial assets that are debt instruments measured at 
amortised cost or FVOCI.  
No material changes to the impairment provisions recorded 
currently are expected on transition to IFRS 9. The majority of trade 
receivables reside in the Group’s energy supply and services 
business and these businesses already operate a sophisticated 
provision matrix approach based on historic data to establish 
impairment provisions. Adjustments to encompass forward-looking 
estimates into this approach are not expected to be material. The 
impairment of financial assets, subject to the IFRS 9 impairment 
rules, in the other parts of the business are also not expected to 
change materially. 
Hedge accounting 
The Group has elected to continue to apply the hedge accounting 
requirements of IAS 39: ‘Financial instruments: recognition and 
measurement’ instead of the requirements of IFRS 9 as permitted 
by IFRS 9. Hence there will be no changes to the current hedge 
accounting relationships. 
The Group intends to apply the limited exemption in IFRS 9 relating 
to transition for classification and measurement and impairment 
and not restate its comparatives and instead adjust opening equity, 
where applicable, on 1 January 2018 for the impact of adopting 
IFRS 9, with this adjustment currently being finalised.  
IFRS 15 
An extensive review of the Group’s contractual arrangements that 
comprise the Group’s current revenue streams has been 
performed. The conclusion of these reviews is that the adoption of 
IFRS 15, which is effective from 1 January 2018, will not have a 
material impact on the recognition of revenue compared to current 
accounting standards. This is for the following reasons: 
● a significant amount of the Group’s revenue is outside the scope 
of IFRS 15. For example, a portion of our UK Home services 
revenue is from fixed fee service contracts, which are currently 
within the scope of IFRS 4: ‘Insurance contracts’ and the sale of 
much of the Group’s asset production (for example, the majority 
of our Exploration & Production gas production, Central Power 
Generation gas fired power station production and sales of 
power received from the Group’s associate investment in 
Nuclear) is sold in the market via the Group’s Energy Marketing  
& Trading segment through contracts that are in the scope of 
IFRS 9; 
● for the majority of energy supply contracts, because there are no 
minimum quantities whereby the Group delivers the amount of 
energy required by customers on demand, it has been 
concluded that there is only an enforceable right to bill for 
consumption once the customer consumes energy. Revenue 
recognition for these energy supply contracts (which is a 
significant portion of the Group’s revenue) will therefore not differ 
from our current revenue recognition policies; and 
● currently the bundling of products and services is not significant 
for the Group. However, expanding the sale of bundled products 
and services is a key focus for the Group and could therefore 
have a more significant impact on the Group’s revenue 
recognition in the future. The accounting implications and system 
requirements will be addressed as propositions are developed in 
the Group’s customer facing businesses. 
There have been some differences identified in less significant 
revenue streams, notably the gross up of revenue and cost of sales 
for demand side response revenue in Distributed Energy & Power 
in North America where it has been concluded that the business is 
acting as principal under IFRS 15. Additionally, North America 
Home will defer the recognition of some of its revenue in its 
franchise business and capitalise additional costs to obtain  
contracts on adoption of IFRS 15. However, the impact of all of 
these adjustments on opening equity and the Group’s revenue in 
2017 is not material. The full impact of adopting IFRS 15 on the 
Group’s consolidated Financial Statements for 2018 will also 
depend on the contractual arrangements entered into by the Group 
during 2018. 
The Group intends to apply this standard fully retrospectively and 
therefore the 2017 comparatives will be restated in the 2018 
consolidated Financial Statements, with these adjustments 
currently being finalised.  
Other standards and amendments  
IFRS 16: ‘Leases’ was issued in January 2016 and will have a 
significant impact on the Group’s consolidated Financial 
Statements as all leases will be recognised on the balance sheet 
(with the exception of short-term and low value leases). A steering 
committee has met several times during the year to discuss the 
approach to the implementation of the standard. During the year, 
an impact analysis on the Group’s results has been performed 
using a sample of representative leases to enable the impact of the 
different transition options to be understood. The feasibility of 
adopting a full retrospective transition approach is being 
investigated whilst the data capture solution is developed in early 
2018. The implementation and data capture work will continue into 
2018 and an appropriate systems solution will be selected. Due to 
the number of leases held by the Group it has not been practicable 
to quantify the full effect it will have on the Group’s consolidated 
Financial Statements, although the operating lease commitment 
data in note 23(a) gives an indication of the scale of lease 
commitments that would be recognised on the balance sheet  
on transition. 
Management does not currently expect the future application of the 
Annual Improvements to IFRS Standards 2014-2016 Cycle to have 
a material impact on the amounts reported and disclosed in the 
consolidated Financial Statements.

1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT NEW ACCOUNTING 
POLICIES AND REPORTING CHANGES 
there is an accounting policy choice to account for these contracts 
under IFRS 17 or IFRS 15. As this could change the accounting for 
these contracts, this will be considered during the implementation 
of IFRS 17.  
Management does not currently expect the future application of the 
IFRIC interpretations and amendments to have a material impact 
on the amounts reported and disclosed in the consolidated 
Financial Statements.  
The amendments to IAS 19 apply to plan amendments, 
curtailments or settlements that occur on or after 1 January 2019, 
and the amendments to IFRS 3 and IFRS 11 apply to acquisitions 
of additional interests in joint arrangements for which the 
acquisition date is on or after 1 January 2019. As these types of 
transactions can vary in size and are non-recurring in nature, the 
Group cannot quantify the effect that these amendments could 
potentially have in the future.  
2. CENTRICA SPECIFIC ACCOUNTING MEASURES 
This section sets out the Group’s specific accounting 
measures applied in the preparation of the consolidated 
Financial Statements. These measures enable the users of the 
accounts to understand the Group’s underlying and statutory 
business performance separately. 
(a) Use of adjusted performance measures 
The Directors believe that reporting adjusted profit, adjusted 
earnings per share and adjusted operating cash flow provides 
additional useful information on business performance and underlying 
trends. These measures are used for internal performance purposes. 
The adjusted measures in this report are not defined terms under 
IFRS and may not be comparable with similarly titled measures 
reported by other companies. 
The measure of operating profit used by management to evaluate 
segment performance is adjusted operating profit. Adjusted 
operating profit is defined as operating profit before: 
● exceptional items; and 
● certain re-measurements; 
but including: 
● the Group’s share of results from joint ventures and associates 
before interest and taxation. 
Exceptional items and certain re-measurements are excluded 
because these items are considered by the Directors to distort the 
Group’s underlying business performance. See note 2(b) for further 
details. The Group’s share of results from joint ventures and 
associates is presented before interest and taxation because this 
gives a consistent measurement of results compared to wholly 
owned subsidiaries. 
Note 4 contains an analysis of adjusted operating profit by segment 
and a reconciliation of adjusted operating profit to operating profit 
after exceptional items and certain re-measurements. 
Note 4 also contains an analysis of adjusted operating profit after 
taxation by segment and a reconciliation to the statutory results for 
the year. Adjusted operating profit after taxation is defined as 
adjusted operating profit, net of associated taxation, before: 
● the impact of changes to UK and US corporation tax rates; and 
● certain Corporate and other taxation. 
Given the significant variance in tax rates for different jurisdictions 
and different businesses within the Group, this measure provides 
management with an analysis of each segment’s contribution to 
overall earnings. The impact of changes to UK and US corporation 
tax rates is excluded because it predominantly relates to future tax 
impacts rather than the current year performance. The measure 
excludes interest and related tax impacts because this measure 
provides an analysis of the segment’s operating performance and 
its contribution to earnings before the impact of the financing of  
the segment.  
Adjusted earnings is defined as earnings before: 
● exceptional items net of taxation; and  
● certain re-measurements net of taxation. 
A reconciliation of adjusted earnings and adjusted earnings per 
share is provided in note 10. 
Adjusted operating cash flow is used by management to assess 
the cash generating abilities of each segment. Adjusted operating 
cash flow is defined as net cash flow from operating activities 
before: 
● payments relating to exceptional items; 
● deficit reduction payments made to the UK defined benefit 
pension schemes; and 
● movements in variation margin and cash collateral that are 
included in net debt; 
but including: 
● dividends received from joint ventures and associates.  
Payments related to exceptional items are excluded because the 
Directors do not consider these to represent underlying business 
performance. Deficit reduction payments and movements in variation 
margin and cash collateral are excluded because the Directors do 
not consider these to represent the operating cash flows generated 
by underlying business performance, as they are predominantly 
triggered by wider market factors and, in the case of variation margin 
and cash collateral, these represent timing differences. Dividends 
received from joint ventures and associates are considered by the 
Directors to represent operating cash flows generated by the 
Group’s operations that are structured in this manner. 
(b) Exceptional items and certain re-measurements 
The Group reflects its underlying financial results in the ‘business 
performance’ column of the Group Income Statement. To be able 
to provide users with this clear and consistent presentation, the 
effects of ‘certain re-measurements’ of financial instruments, and 
‘exceptional items’, are reported in a different column in the Group 
Income Statement. 
The Group is an integrated energy business. This means that it 
utilises its knowledge and experience across the gas and power 
(and related commodity) value chains to make profits across the 
core markets in which it operates. As part of this strategy, the 
Group enters into a number of forward energy trades to protect 
and optimise the value of its underlying production, generation, 
storage and transportation assets (and similar capacity or off-take 
contracts), as well as to meet the future needs of its customers 
(downstream demand). These trades are designed to reduce the 
risk of holding such assets, contracts or downstream demand and 
are subject to strict risk limits and controls. 
Primarily because some of these trades include terms that permit 
net settlement, they are prohibited from being designated as ‘own 
use’ and so IAS 39: ‘Financial instruments: recognition and 
measurement’ requires them to be individually fair valued. Fair value 
movements on these commodity derivative trades do not reflect 
the underlying performance of the business because they are 
economically related to our upstream assets, capacity/off-take 
contracts or downstream demand, which are typically not fair 
valued. Therefore, these certain re-measurements are reported 
separately and are subsequently reflected in business performance 
when the underlying transaction or asset impacts profit or loss.

2. CENTRICA SPECIFIC ACCOUNTING MEASURES 
The arrangements discussed above and reflected as certain re-
measurements are all managed separately from proprietary energy 
trading activities where trades are entered into speculatively for the 
purpose of making profits in their own right. These proprietary trades 
are included in the business performance column of the Group 
Income Statement, in the results before certain re-measurements. 
Exceptional items are those items that, in the judgement of the 
Directors, need to be disclosed separately by virtue of their nature, 
size or incidence. Again, to ensure the business performance 
column reflects the underlying results of the Group, these 
exceptional items are also reported in the separate column in the 
Group Income Statement. Items that may be considered 
exceptional in nature include disposals of businesses or significant 
assets, business restructurings, significant onerous contract 
charges/releases, asset impairments/write-backs, certain pension 
past service credits, the tax effects of these items and the effect of 
changes in UK upstream tax rates. 
3. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING JUDGEMENTS AND 
KEY SOURCES OF ESTIMATION UNCERTAINTY  
This section sets out the key areas of judgement and 
estimation that have the most significant effect on the 
amounts recognised in the consolidated Financial Statements. 
(a) Critical judgements in applying the Group’s 
accounting policies 
Such key judgements include the following: 
● the presentation of selected items as exceptional (see notes 2 
and 7); 
● the use of adjusted profit, adjusted earnings per share and 
adjusted operating cash flow measures (see notes 2, 4 and 10); 
and 
● the classification of energy procurement contracts as  
derivative financial instruments and presentation as certain  
re-measurements (see notes 2, 7 and 19). 
In addition, management has made the following key judgements  
in applying the Group’s accounting policies that have the most 
significant effect on the consolidated Group Financial Statements. 
Wind farm disposals 
In prior years, the profits and losses arising on disposals of equity 
interests in wind farms were recognised within the business 
performance column of the Group Income Statement as part of the 
Central Power Generation segment. These divestments were in line 
with the Group’s established wind farm strategy to realise value, 
share risk and reduce our capital requirements as individual 
projects developed, which involved bringing in partners at an 
appropriate stage or full disposal. 
In July 2015, the Group announced its intention to exit its 245MW 
portfolio of wind assets. During 2016, the Group disposed of its 
investment in GLID Wind Farms TopCo Limited (GLID), which 
owned Glens of Foudland, Lynn and Inner Dowsing wind farms, as 
part of this strategy. The post-tax profit on disposal of £73 million 
was classified as an exceptional item in the Group Income 
Statement because the Directors judged the exit from the wind 
business to be non-recurring in nature and distinct from the 
Group’s established wind farm strategy.  
The Group completed its exit from wind generation ownership with 
the disposal of Lincs Wind Farm Limited, announced on 13 January 
2017 and completed on 17 February 2017. This was treated in a 
similar manner as GLID in the Group Income Statement, generating 
an exceptional post-tax profit on disposal of £58 million (see  
note 12). 
Leases – third-party power station tolling arrangements 
The Group’s Spalding long-term power station tolling contract in 
the UK was considered a lease during 2017. 
The arrangement provided Centrica with the right to nominate 
100% of the plant capacity for the duration of the contract in return 
for a mix of capacity payments and operating payments based on 
plant availability.  
The Spalding contract runs until 2021 and Centrica holds an option 
to extend the tolling arrangement for a further eight years, 
exercisable by 30 September 2020. If extended, Centrica is 
granted an option to purchase the station at the end of this further 
period. Management has determined that the arrangement should 
be accounted for as a finance lease, as the lease term was judged 
to be substantially all of the economic life of the power station and 
the present value of the minimum lease payments at the inception 
date of the arrangement amounted to substantially all of the fair 
value of the power station at that time. 
In May 2016 and December 2017, a number of revisions to this 
tolling arrangement were agreed; however this has not changed the 
accounting assessment of the contract as a finance lease. 
Details of the interest charges, finance lease asset and finance 
lease payable are included in notes 8, 13 and 24 respectively. 
Business combinations and asset acquisitions  
Classification of an acquisition as a business combination or  
an asset acquisition depends on whether the assets acquired 
constitute a business, which can be a complex judgement. 
Whether an acquisition is classified as a business combination or 
asset acquisition can have a significant impact on the entries made 
on and after acquisition. 
Business combinations and acquisitions of associates and joint 
ventures require a fair value exercise to be undertaken to allocate 
the purchase price (cost) to the fair value of the acquired identifiable 
assets, liabilities, contingent liabilities and goodwill. 
As a result of the nature of fair value assessments in the energy 
industry, this purchase price allocation exercise requires subjective 
judgements based on a wide range of complex variables at a point 
in time. Management uses all available information to make the fair 
value determinations. 
During the year the Group acquired: Bayerngas Norge AS’s 
exploration and production business; REstore NV, Europe’s leading 
demand response aggregator; and the assets of Rokitt Inc. These 
acquisitions have been accounted for as business combinations as 
set out in note 12(a). 
Spirit Energy consolidation and preference shares 
During the year, the Group acquired Bayerngas Norge’s exploration 
and production business and combined this with the Group’s 
existing Exploration & Production business within the newly formed 
Spirit Energy business (SE). The Group’s interest in SE is 69%. The 
Group can appoint four directors and the non-controlling interest 
SWM Bayerische E&P Beteiligungsgesellschaft mbH can appoint 
two directors with the CEO being an independent director. The 
Group, through this board majority, can control decisions that 
represent Board Reserved Matters, which include the approval  
or amendment of the Business Plan or the Budget. The Directors 
consider that the right to approve or amend the Business Plan  
or Budget provides control over the relevant activities that most 
significantly influence the variable returns of the SE business. The 
Group, through its board majority, has power over this decision. 
Whilst SE has been established as an independent business, this  
is judged not to prevent the Group concluding that it controls SE. 
Additionally, Fundamental Reserved Matters, which require 
unanimous consent, are judged to represent minority protection 
rather than decision making rights associated with the relevant 
activities. Consequently SE is fully consolidated with a non-
controlling interest of 31%.

3. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING JUDGEMENTS AND 
KEY SOURCES OF ESTIMATION UNCERTAINTY  
Spirit Energy Limited (the parent company of SE) has issued 
preference shares to the Group and SWM Gasbeteiligungs GmbH 
& Co. KG. The Directors have reviewed the redemption and 
conversion rights of the shares and have concluded that in each 
case the redemption is at the discretion of the issuer, Spirit Energy 
Limited. Whilst the agreements provide incentives for the Group to 
redeem these shares through the waiver of its dividend under 
certain circumstances, and the agreements indicate an intention to 
redeem, the Group has concluded that Spirit Energy Limited retains 
the discretion to avoid redemption and therefore the preference 
shares do not represent an obligation. Similarly, the conversion 
rights are at the discretion of Spirit Energy Limited and do not 
create an obligation. The preference shares pay a fixed coupon or 
dividend of 5.5% plus a floating element subject to a cap of 1.5%, 
and again despite the agreement stating a dividend policy and the 
intention to pay dividends, these remain at the discretion of the 
directors of Spirit Energy Limited. Accordingly, the preference 
shares are deemed to represent equity rather than a financial 
liability and therefore the 31% held by SWM Gasbeteiligungs 
GmbH & Co. KG forms part of the Group’s non-controlling  
interest balance.  
Consolidation of the CQ Energy Canada Partnership 
The Suncor upstream acquisition in 2013 involved the formation of 
the CQ Energy Canada Partnership (CQECP) to acquire Suncor 
Energy’s North American gas and oil assets. CQECP was owned 
and funded by the Group and Qatar Petroleum International (QPI) 
on a 60:40 basis. The partnership provided the Group with the 
ability to control the business plan and budgets and consequently 
the general operation of the assets. Accordingly, this arrangement 
had been assessed under IFRS 10: ‘Consolidated financial 
statements’ and the conclusion had been reached that the Group 
had power over the relevant activities of CQECP. This entity was 
fully consolidated into the Group’s Financial Statements and QPI’s 
ownership share was represented as a non-controlling interest up 
to its disposal on 29 September 2017. See note 12(d). 
Energy Company Obligation 
The Energy Company Obligation (ECO) order requires UK-licensed 
energy suppliers to improve the energy efficiency of domestic 
households from 1 January 2013. Targets are set in proportion to 
the size of historic customer bases. ECO phase 1 and ECO phase 
2 had delivery dates of 31 March 2015 and 31 March 2017, 
respectively. ECO phase 2 (now ECO phase 2t) has been extended 
to 30 September 2018. The Group continues to judge that it is not 
legally obligated by this order until 30 September 2018 for ECO 
phase 2t. Accordingly, the costs of delivery are recognised as 
incurred, when cash was spent or unilateral commitments made, 
resulting in obligations that could not be avoided. 
Metering contracts  
The Department for Business, Energy & Industrial Strategy has 
modified UK gas and electricity supply licences requiring all 
domestic premises to be fitted with compliant smart meters for 
measuring energy consumption by 31 December 2020. The Group 
has a number of existing rental contracts for non-compliant meters 
that include penalty charges if these meters are removed from use 
before the end of their deemed useful lives. The Group considers 
that these contracts are not onerous until the meters have been 
physically removed from use and, therefore, only recognises a 
provision for penalty charges at this point. 
In 2015, as part of the smart meter roll-out, the Group renewed 
meter rental arrangements with third-parties. The Group assessed 
that these were not leases because it did not have the right to 
physically or operationally control the smart meters and other 
parties also took a significant amount of the output from the assets. 
(b) Key sources of estimation uncertainty 
Estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical 
experience and various other factors that are believed to be 
reasonable under the circumstances, including current and 
expected economic conditions, and, in some cases, actuarial 
techniques. Although these estimates and associated assumptions 
are based on management’s best knowledge of current events and 
circumstances, actual results may differ.  
Revenue recognition – unread gas and electricity meters 
Revenue for energy supply activities includes an assessment of 
energy supplied to customers between the date of the last meter 
reading and the year end (known as unread revenue). Unread gas 
and electricity comprises both billed and unbilled revenue. It is 
estimated through the billing systems, using historical consumption 
patterns, on a customer by customer basis, taking into account 
weather patterns, load forecasts and the differences between 
actual meter readings being returned and system estimates.  
Actual meter readings continue to be compared to system 
estimates between the balance sheet date and the finalisation of 
the accounts.  
An assessment is also made of any factors that are likely to materially 
affect the ultimate economic benefits that will flow to the Group, 
including bill cancellation and re-bill rates. To the extent that the 
economic benefits are not expected to flow to the Group, the value 
of that revenue is not recognised. The judgements applied, and the 
assumptions underpinning these judgements, are considered to be 
appropriate. However, a change in these assumptions would have 
an impact on the amount of revenue recognised. Unbilled revenue 
recognised on the balance sheet within trade and other receivables 
at 31 December 2017 was £1,585 million (2016: £1,715 million). 
Industry reconciliation process – cost of sales 
Industry reconciliation procedures are required as differences arise 
between the estimated quantity of gas and electricity the Group 
deems to have supplied and billed customers, and the estimated 
quantity industry system operators deem the individual suppliers, 
including the Group, to have supplied to customers. The difference 
in deemed supply is referred to as imbalance. The reconciliation 
procedures can result in either a higher or a lower value of industry 
deemed supply than has been estimated as being supplied to 
customers by the Group, but in practice tends to result in a higher 
value of industry deemed supply. The Group reviews the difference 
to ascertain whether there is evidence that its estimate of amounts 
supplied to customers is inaccurate or whether the difference 
arises from other causes. The Group’s share of the resulting 
imbalance is included within commodity costs charged to cost of 
sales. Management estimates the level of recovery of imbalance 
that will be achieved either through subsequent customer billing  
or through developing industry settlement procedures. The 
adjustments for imbalance at 31 December 2017 are not 
significant. However, changes resulting from these management 
estimates can be material with adjustments of between £50 million 
and £60 million having been made in the last few years. 
Decommissioning costs 
The estimated cost of decommissioning at the end of the 
producing lives of gas and oil fields (including storage facility 
assets) is reviewed periodically and is based on reserves, price 
levels and technology at the balance sheet date. Provision is made 
for the estimated cost of decommissioning at the balance sheet 
date. The payment dates of total expected future decommissioning 
costs are uncertain and dependent on the lives of the facilities, but 
are currently anticipated to be incurred until 2040. See note 21 for 
further details including the impact of the triennial review of the 
Group’s Exploration & Production assets.  
The level of provision held is also sensitive to the discount rate 
used to discount the estimated decommissioning costs. In 2016 
the real discount rate used to discount the Group’s European 
Exploration & Production decommissioning liabilities was reduced

KEY SOURCES OF ESTIMATION UNCERTAINTY  
by 1%, which resulted in an increase in the provision of  
£229 million. The real discount rate used to discount the 
decommissioning liabilities at 31 December 2017 is unchanged  
at 1.2%. 
Significant judgements and estimates are also made about the 
costs of decommissioning nuclear power stations and the costs of 
waste management and spent fuel. These estimates could impact 
the carrying value of our Nuclear investment. Various arrangements 
and indemnities are in place with the Secretary of State with 
respect to these costs, as explained in note S2. 
Gas and liquids reserves 
The volume of proven and probable (2P) gas and liquids reserves  
is an estimate that affects the unit of production method of 
depreciating producing gas and liquids property, plant and 
equipment (PP&E) as well as being a significant estimate affecting 
decommissioning and impairment calculations. The factors 
impacting gas and liquids estimates, the process for estimating 
reserve quantities and reserve recognition is described on  
page 201. 
The impact of a change in estimated 2P reserves is dealt with 
prospectively by depreciating the remaining book value of 
producing assets over the expected future production. If 2P 
reserves estimates are revised downwards, earnings could be 
affected by higher depreciation expense or an immediate write-
down (impairment) of the asset’s book value. 
Determination of fair values – energy derivatives 
Fair values of energy derivatives are estimated by reference in part 
to published price quotations in active markets and in part by using 
valuation techniques. More detail on the assumptions used in 
determining fair valuations of energy derivatives is provided in note 
S6 and of the sensitivities to these assumptions in note S3.  
Impairment of long-lived assets  
The Group has several material long-lived assets, which are 
assessed or tested for impairment at each reporting date in 
accordance with the Group’s accounting policy as described in 
note 7. The Group makes judgements and estimates in considering 
whether the carrying amounts of these assets or cash generating 
units (CGUs) are recoverable. The key assets that are subjected to 
impairment tests are upstream Exploration & Production gas and 
oil assets, power generation assets, storage facility assets, Nuclear 
investment (20% economic interest accounted for as an investment 
in associate) and goodwill, as detailed below. 
Exploration & Production gas and oil assets 
The recoverable amount of the Group’s gas and oil assets is 
determined by discounting the post-tax cash flows expected to be 
generated by the assets over their lives taking into account those 
assumptions that market participants would take into account 
when assessing fair value. The cash flows are derived from 
projected production profiles of each field, based predominantly on 
expected 2P reserves and take into account forward prices for gas 
and liquids over the relevant period. Where forward market prices 
are not available, prices are determined based on internal 
model inputs. 
Further details of the assumptions used in determining the 
recoverable amounts, the impairments and the impairment 
reversals booked during the year and sensitivity to the assumptions 
are provided in note 7. 
Power generation assets 
The recoverable amount of the Group’s power generation assets  
is calculated by discounting the pre-tax cash flows expected to be 
generated by the assets and is dependent on views of forecast 
power generation and forecast power, gas, carbon and capacity 
prices (where applicable) and the timing and extent of capital 
expenditure. Where forward market prices are not available, prices 
are determined based on internal model inputs. Further details of 
the impairment reversals booked during the year are provided in 
note 7. 
Storage facility assets 
The recoverable amount of the Group’s operational storage 
facilities is calculated by discounting the post-tax cash flows 
expected to be generated by the assets based on forecasts of  
the value from extracting cushion gas at the end of the life of the 
storage facility less any related capital and operating expenditure 
following the Group’s application to permanently end Rough’s 
status as a storage facility and the Group’s application for a 
production consent to produce gas from the reservoir, which was 
granted on 15 January 2018, to take effect from 17 January 2018. 
Further details of the impairments booked during the year and 
sensitivity to the assumptions are provided in note 7. 
Nuclear investment 
The recoverable amount of the Nuclear investment is based on the 
value of the existing UK nuclear fleet operated by EDF. The existing 
fleet value is calculated by discounting post-tax cash flows derived 
from the stations based on forecast power generation and power 
prices, whilst taking account of planned outages and the possibility 
of life extensions. Further details of the methodology and sensitivity 
to the assumptions are provided in note 7. 
Goodwill 
Goodwill does not generate independent cash flows and accordingly 
is allocated at inception to specific CGUs or groups of CGUs for 
impairment testing purposes. The recoverable amounts of these 
CGUs are derived from estimates of future cash flows (as described 
in the asset classes above) and hence the goodwill impairment tests 
are also subject to these key estimates. The results of these tests 
may then be verified by reference to external market valuation data. 
Further details on the goodwill balances and the assumptions used 
in determining the recoverable amounts are provided in notes 7, 
15(b) and S2. Sensitivity to the assumptions is also found in note 7 
for goodwill allocated to Exploration & Production CGUs. 
Credit provisions for trade and other receivables  
The methodology for determining provisions for credit losses on 
trade and other receivables and the level of such provision is set 
out in note 17. Although the provisions recognised are considered 
appropriate, the use of different assumptions or changes in 
economic conditions could lead to movements in the provisions 
and therefore impact the Group Income Statement.  
Pensions and other post-employment benefits 
The cost of providing benefits under defined benefit schemes is 
determined separately for each of the Group’s schemes under the 
projected unit credit actuarial valuation method. Actuarial gains and 
losses are recognised in full in the period in which they occur. The 
key assumptions used for the actuarial valuation are based on the 
Group’s best estimate of the variables that will determine the 
ultimate cost of providing post-employment benefits. Further 
details, including sensitivities to these assumptions, are provided  
in note 22.

(c) Operating profit before and after taxation 
The measure of profit used by the Group is adjusted operating profit. Adjusted operating profit is operating profit before 
exceptional items and certain re-measurements. This includes results of equity-accounted interests before interest and taxation. 
This note also details adjusted operating profit after taxation. Both measures are reconciled to their statutory equivalents.

(i) In 2017 the effective tax rates of certain segments, including Ireland, UK Business and Central Power Generation, are impacted by prior year adjustments. In both 2017 and 2016 the Central 
Power Generation segment effective tax rate was also impacted by non-taxable income in the segment’s associate’s profits. 
(ii) In 2017, the effective tax rate in the Centrica Storage segment is higher (2016: lower) than the standard UK Corporation tax rate of 19.25% due principally to the mix of profits and losses 
across upstream and downstream activities, to which different tax rates apply (see note 9). 
(iii) Segment adjusted operating profit after taxation includes profit of £7 million (2016: loss of £5 million) attributable to non-controlling interests. 
(iv) The 2017 amount relates to a change to the US tax rate; the 2016 amount related to changes to UK tax rates. The amounts include nil (2016: £9 million) relating to equity-accounted 
interests. 
(v) Includes joint ventures’/associates’ interest, net of associated taxation.

write-backs were recognised as follows: Exploration & Production: £86 million impairment, Central Power Generation: £3 million write-
back, Distributed Energy & Power: £1 million impairment. Considering their size and nature, all such current and prior year impairments 
and write-backs were recognised within business performance. 
Write-downs and impairments of intangible assets 
During 2017, £9 million of write-downs (2016: £19 million) relating to exploration and evaluation assets were recognised in the Exploration 
& Production segment. During 2016, a £1 million impairment of application software was recognised in the Ireland segment. All such

6. SHARE OF RESULTS OF JOINT VENTURES AND ASSOCIATES 
Share of results of joint ventures and associates represents the results of businesses where we exercise joint control or significant 
influence and generally have an equity holding of up to 50%. 
(a) Share of results of joint ventures and associates 
The Group’s share of results of joint ventures and associates for the year ended 31 December 2017 principally arises from its interest  
in Nuclear - Lake Acquisitions Limited, an associate, reported in the Central Power Generation segment.

impairments £494 million, post-tax £162 million; including a PRT credit of £207 million), predominantly due to a reduction in long-term price forecasts, reserves and changes to expected 
decommissioning costs following the conclusion of the triennial review. Also included is the reduction of decommissioning provisions (pre-tax £86 million, post-tax £51 million) for assets 
previously impaired through exceptional items.  
(iii) A pre-tax impairment of £270 million (post-tax £224 million) has been recorded in the current year in respect of the UK Rough gas storage asset, following the June 2017 announcement to 
apply for a production licence and permanently end Rough’s status as a storage facility. 
(iv) On 17 February 2017, the Group disposed of its joint venture investment in Lincs Wind Farm for net proceeds of £214 million, giving rise to a pre-tax gain on disposal of £64 million (post-tax 
£58 million). On 31 August 2017, the Group disposed of its Langage, South Humber Bank and King’s Lynn B power station assets for net proceeds of £314 million, giving a pre and post-tax 
loss of £7 million. These power station assets were originally classified as held for sale as at 30 June 2017 and a net pre-tax write-back of £15 million (post-tax £12 million) was recognised.  
(v) On 27 May 2017, the Group disposed of its remaining portfolio of gas assets in Trinidad and Tobago for consideration of US$35 million (£26 million) giving rise to a pre and post-tax loss on 
disposal of £9 million. On 29 September 2017, the Group disposed of its Canadian exploration and production business for C$420 million (£255 million) giving rise to a pre and post-tax loss 
on disposal of £28 million. These Canadian exploration and production assets were classified as held for sale as at 30 June 2017 and a net pre-tax impairment of £97 million (post-tax £81 
million) was recorded. Both the Canadian exploration and production business and the Trinidad and Tobago assets were foreign operations and accounted for in non-GBP currencies. 
Consequently the relevant foreign currency translation reserve (including any net investment hedging) has been recycled to the Group Income Statement. 
(vi) Following the Group’s strategic review announced in 2015, the Group has incurred restructuring costs during the year implementing the new organisational model relating principally to 
redundancy costs, transformational spend and consultancy costs. The post-tax impact was £68 million. 
(vii) Business change costs relate to changing the business operating model in Storage, the Exploration & Production Bayerngas Norge acquisition and the closure of the US solar business. The 
costs principally relate to impairment of assets, redundancy and consultancy costs and various change of control costs associated with the Bayerngas Norge transaction. The post-tax impact 
was £39 million. 
(viii) Included within net taxation is a £21 million credit associated with the leased Spalding CCGT power station, previously impaired through exceptional items.  
(b) Certain re-measurements 
Certain re-measurements are the fair value movements on energy contracts entered into to meet the future needs of our 
customers or to sell the energy produced from our upstream assets. These contracts are economically related to our upstream 
assets, capacity/off-take contracts or downstream demand, which are typically not fair valued, and are therefore separately 
identified in the current period and reflected in business performance in future periods when the underlying transaction or asset 
impacts the Group Income Statement.

7. EXCEPTIONAL ITEMS AND CERTAIN RE-MEASUREMENTS 
(c) Impairment accounting policy, process and sensitivities  
The Group tests the carrying amounts of goodwill, PP&E and intangible assets (with the exception of exploration assets – see note S2) for 
impairment annually, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the recoverable amounts may be lower than 
their carrying amounts. Interests in joint ventures and associates and exploration assets are reviewed annually for indicators of impairment 
and tested for impairment where such an indicator arises. Where an asset does not generate cash flows that are independent from other 
assets, the Group estimates the recoverable amount of the CGU to which the asset belongs. The recoverable amount is the higher of 
value in use (VIU) and fair value less costs of disposal (FVLCD).  
At inception, goodwill is allocated to each of the Group’s CGUs or groups of CGUs that expect to benefit from the business combination 
in which the goodwill arose. If the recoverable amount of an asset (or CGU) is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying 
amount of the asset (or CGU) is reduced to its recoverable amount. Any impairment is expensed immediately in the Group Income 
Statement. Any CGU impairment loss is allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the CGU and then to the 
other assets of the CGU pro rata on the basis of the carrying amount of each asset in the CGU. 
The impairment tests for the Exploration & Production gas and oil assets and CGUs (including goodwill), the Group’s associate investment 
in Nuclear and the Storage PP&E asset, have used FVLCD to determine their recoverable amounts. This methodology is deemed to be 
appropriate for these assets and CGUs as it is based on the post-tax cash flows arising from the underlying assets and is consistent with 
the approach taken by management to evaluate the economic value of the underlying assets. VIU calculations have been used to 
determine recoverable amounts for all other CGUs that include goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets. UK power generation assets 
have also been valued using the VIU impairment methodology. Further details of the approach and assumptions used in the VIU 
calculations are provided in note S2.  
FVLCD discount rate and cash flow assumptions 
The price assumptions used to determine recoverable amounts for FVLCD calculations are based on the liquid market prices for the three 
year period, 2018 to 2020. The longer-term price assumptions thereafter are derived using valuation techniques based on available 
external data and with reference to market comparators. The average price for the period 2018 to 2022 was 45p per therm for NBP Gas, 
US$65 per barrel for Brent and £43 per MWh for Baseload Power (all in real terms) thereafter nominal prices are broadly inflated. The 
valuation of the Group’s portfolio of assets is more sensitive to NBP Gas and Baseload Power prices than to Brent.  
Exploration & Production assets 
A net impairment of £408 million (2016: write-back £79 million) has been recorded within exceptional items for retained Exploration & 
Production assets net of £86 million of reductions to decommissioning provisions. For those assets subject to the net impairment, the 
associated recoverable amounts (net of decommissioning costs) of £401 million are categorised within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. 
FVLCD is determined by discounting the post-tax cash flows expected to be generated by the gas and oil production and development 
assets, net of associated selling costs, taking into account those assumptions that market participants would use in estimating fair value. 
Post-tax cash flows are derived from projected production profiles of each field, taking into account forward prices for gas and liquids over 
the relevant period. Where forward market prices are not available (that is outside the active period for each commodity), prices are 
determined based on internal model inputs. Note S6 provides additional detail on the active period of each of the commodity markets in 
which the Group operates. The date of cessation of production depends on the interaction of a number of variables, such as the 
recoverable quantities of hydrocarbons, production costs, the contractual duration of the licence area and the selling price of the gas and 
liquids produced. As each field has specific reservoir characteristics and economic circumstances, the post-tax cash flows for each field 
are computed using individual economic models. Post-tax cash flows used in the FVLCD calculation for the first five years are based on 
the Group’s Board-approved business plans and, thereafter, are based on long-term production and cash flow forecasts, which 
management believes reflects the assumptions of a market participant.  
The future post-tax cash flows are discounted using a post-tax nominal discount rate of 8.5% (2016: 9.0%) to determine the FVLCD. The 
discount rate and inflation rate used in the FVLCD calculation are determined in the same manner as the rates used in the VIU calculations 
described in note S2, with the exception of the adjustment required to determine an equivalent pre-tax discount rate. 
The valuation of Exploration & Production assets and goodwill are particularly sensitive to the price assumptions made in the impairment 
calculations. To illustrate this, the price assumptions for gas and oil have been varied by +/–10%. Changes in price generate different 
production profiles and in some cases the date that an asset ceases production. This has been considered in the sensitivity analysis. 
Otherwise, all other operating costs, life of field capital expenditure and abandonment expenditure assumptions remain unchanged. For 
Exploration & Production assets, an increase in gas and oil prices of 10% would potentially reverse £148 million (2016: £89 million) of 
previous post-tax impairment charges of the underlying exploration and production assets. A reduction of 10% would potentially give rise 
to further post-tax impairments of the underlying legacy exploration and production assets of £140 million (2016: £166 million) but no 
post-tax impairment of goodwill (2016: nil) due to adequate headroom.  
Storage 
The recoverable amount of the Group’s storage facility (Rough) is calculated on a FVLCD basis by discounting the post-tax cash flows 
expected to be generated by the asset. In June 2017, the Group announced that the Rough facility could not be safely returned to 
injection and storage operations and it therefore intended to make all relevant applications to permanently end Rough’s status as a 
storage facility. The Group received production consent on 15 January 2018, effective from 17 January 2018, to produce gas from the 
reservoir. Since the cash generating unit that comprises the UK gas storage assets will continue to operate, the Storage business does 
not qualify as a discontinued operation under IFRS 5: ‘Non-current assets held for sale and discontinued operations’.  
The cash flow estimates in the recoverable amount calculation have been based on the revenue from extracting the cushion gas less any 
related capital, operating and decommissioning expenditure. The key assumptions in these estimates are forward gas prices, the timing  
of government consent for production, the amount of gas available and the rate of extraction. Where forward market gas prices are not 
available, prices are determined based on internal model inputs. Note S6 provides additional detail on the active period of each of the 
commodity markets in which the Group operates. The future post-tax cash flows are discounted using a post-tax nominal discount rate  
of 7.5% (2016: 7.5%) to determine FVLCD.

7. EXCEPTIONAL ITEMS AND CERTAIN RE-MEASUREMENTS 
A pre-tax impairment charge of £270 million (post-tax £224 million) has been recorded within exceptional items in the current period. The 
valuation of the recoverable amount of the asset is categorised within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. The carrying amount after this 
impairment amounts to a net liability position of £88 million, including the decommissioning provision and deferred tax. The impairment 
test is particularly sensitive to price assumptions made in the impairment calculation. To illustrate this, the price assumptions for gas and 
liquids have been varied by +/–10%. An increase of 10% would potentially reverse impairments of £76 million. A decrease of 10% would 
potentially give rise to a further impairment of £20 million. 
Central Power Generation – Nuclear 
No impairment charge has been recorded (2016: nil) for the Group’s associate investment in Nuclear. FVLCD is determined by discounting 
the post-tax cash flows expected to be generated by the investment, net of associated selling costs, taking into account those assumptions 
that market participants would use in estimating fair value. Post-tax cash flows are derived from projected production profiles of the underlying 
nuclear power stations, planned and unplanned outage assumptions, operating cost assumptions and forward prices for power and forecast 
capacity market auction prices. Where forward market prices are not available (that is outside the active period for each commodity), prices 
are determined based on internal model inputs. Note S6 provides additional detail of the active period of each of the commodity markets in 
which the Group operates. Post-tax cash flows used in the FVLCD calculations for the first five years are based on the Group’s Board-
approved business plans and thereafter are based on long-term production and cash flow forecasts.  
The future post-tax cash flows are discounted using a post-tax nominal discount rate of 7% (2016: 8%) to determine the FVLCD. The 
discount rate and inflation rate used in the FVLCD calculation are determined in the same manner as the rates used in the VIU calculations 
described in note S2, with the exception of the adjustment required to determine an equivalent pre-tax discount rate.  
The valuation of the Group’s investment in Nuclear, which is categorised within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy, is particularly sensitive to 
assumptions/variations in the power price. To illustrate this, sensitivities were performed at the year end to vary the power price 
assumptions in the Group’s internal valuation model by +/–10% and separately to vary the discount rate by +/–1%. An increase in power 
prices of 10%, assuming all other assumptions remain constant, would result in a reversal of previous impairments of £477 million (2016: 
£444 million). A reduction of 10% would give rise to an impairment charge of £442 million (2016: £461 million). An increase in the discount 
rate of 1%, assuming all other assumptions remain constant, would result in an impairment charge of £125 million (2016: £138 million).  
A decrease in the discount rate of 1% would result in an impairment write-back of £187 million (2016: £145 million). 
8. NET FINANCE COST 
Financing costs mainly comprise interest on bonds and bank debt, the results of hedging activities used to manage foreign 
exchange and interest rate movements on the Group’s borrowings, and notional interest arising on discounting of 
decommissioning provisions and pensions. An element of financing cost is capitalised on qualifying projects.  
Investment income predominantly includes interest received on short-term investments in money market funds, bank deposits, 
and government bonds.

9. TAXATION 
The taxation note details the different tax charges and rates, including current and deferred tax arising in the Group. The current 
tax charge is the tax payable on this year’s taxable profits together with amendments in respect of tax provisions made in earlier 
years. This tax charge excludes share of taxation on the results of joint ventures and associates. Deferred tax represents the tax 
on differences between the accounting carrying values of assets and liabilities and their tax bases. These differences are 
temporary and are expected to unwind in the future.

(iii) During the year, the US tax rate was reduced from 35% to 21%. This has resulted in a £3 million charge to be recognised within the year due to a change to the net deferred tax assets at the 
date the rate changed. 
(iv) A comprehensive review as part of business transformation activities in North America during 2016 enabled certain deferred tax balances to be adjusted. 
(v) Total taxation on profit/(loss) excludes taxation on the Group’s share of profits of joint ventures and associates. 
UK tax rates 
The Group earns the majority of its profits in the UK. Most activities in the UK are subject to the standard rate for UK corporation tax, 
which for 2017 was 19.25% (2016: 20%). Upstream gas and oil production activities are taxed at a UK corporation tax rate of 30% (2016: 
30%) plus a supplementary charge of 10% (2016: 10%) to give an overall rate of 40% (2016: 40%). In addition, certain upstream assets in 
the UK attract petroleum revenue tax (PRT) at 0% (2016: 0%), giving an overall effective rate of 40% (2016: 40%).  
On 6 September 2016, the UK Government substantively enacted Finance Act 2016 which included a reduction in the main UK 
corporation tax rate to 17% from 1 April 2020. At 31 December 2017, the relevant UK deferred tax assets and liabilities included in these 
consolidated Group Financial Statements were based on the reduced rate having regard to their reversal profiles. 
Non-UK tax rates 
Norwegian upstream profits are taxed at the standard rate of 24% (2016: 25%) plus a special tax of 54% (2016: 53%) resulting in an 
aggregate tax rate of 78% (2016: 78%). Profits earned in the US prior to 22 December 2017 were taxed at a Federal rate of 35% together 
with state taxes at various rates dependent on the state. On 22 December 2017, the US enacted a reduction in the Federal rate to 21% 
effective from 1 January 2018. Deferred tax assets and liabilities at 31 December 2017 were based on the reduced rate. Taxation for other 
jurisdictions is calculated at the rate prevailing in those respective jurisdictions, with rates ranging from 12.5% in the Republic of Ireland to 
50% in the Netherlands. The tax charges were not material in such jurisdictions. 
Prior year adjustments reflect changes made to estimates or to judgements when further information becomes available. 
Movements in deferred tax liabilities and assets are disclosed in note 16. 
Tax on items taken directly to equity is disclosed in note S4.

9. TAXATION 
(b) Factors affecting the tax charge 
The Group is expected to continue earning the majority of its profits in the UK and accordingly considers the standard UK rate to be the 
appropriate reference rate.

The Group is subject to taxation in a number of jurisdictions. The complexity of applicable rules may result in legitimate differences of 
interpretation between the Group and taxing authorities (or between different taxing authorities) especially where an economic judgement 
or valuation is involved. Resolution of these differences typically takes many years. The uncertain tax provisions represent multiple layers of 
estimation for different time periods and different jurisdictions.  
The principal element relates to transfer pricing challenges in jurisdictions outside the UK. While the Group applies the arm’s length 
principle to all intra-group transactions, taking OECD guidance into account, taxing authorities may take different views. The outcome of 
resolving any disputes is not predictable; the provisions represent management’s assessment of the most likely outcome of each issue. 
The assessment is reviewed and updated on a regular basis. 
(c) Factors that may affect future tax charges 
The Group’s effective tax rates are impacted by changes to the mix of activities and production across the territories in which it operates. 
Effective tax rates may also fluctuate where profits and losses cannot be offset for tax purposes, such as in the UK where there is 
generally no offset between upstream gas and oil and downstream results. Losses realised in one territory cannot be offset against profits 
in another. 
The Group’s UK profits earned away from gas and oil production will benefit from reduced rates of corporation tax in 2018 and beyond 
(19% for 2018 and 2019, and 17% from 1 April 2020).  
Profits from gas and oil production in the UK continue to be taxed at rates above the UK statutory rate (40% versus 19%). PRT is now set 
at 0% but may still give rise to historic refunds from the carry-back of excess reliefs (for example, from decommissioning). 
Income earned in territories outside the UK, particularly in Norway, is generally subject to higher effective rates of tax than the current UK 
statutory rate. 
US tax reform has reduced its Federal rate to 21% which will benefit the Group’s effective rate assuming US profits continue.  
Globally, tax reform has significant potential to change tax charges, particularly in relation to the OECD’s Base Erosion and Profit  
Shifting (BEPS) project, which has widespread support. Based on current proposals, the Group does not expect its tax position to  
be impacted materially.

9. TAXATION 
Local tax laws and rates are subject to change, which may have a significant impact on the Group’s future tax charges.  
In the medium term, the Group’s effective tax rate is expected to remain above the UK statutory rate, reflecting a continued upward  
trend in profits earned outside the UK. The mix of upstream/downstream activities across regimes continues to be influential on the 
effective tax rate.

Differences between current tax charged and taxes paid arose principally due to the following factors: 
● Corporation tax payments are generally made by instalment, based on estimated taxable profits, or the prior period’s profits. Payments 
are made on account and the final liability is settled as the tax return is filed. Fluctuations in profits from year to year, one-off items and 
mark-to-market movements within the year may therefore give rise to divergence between the charge for the year and the taxes paid.  
In certain jurisdictions advance tax payments are required (based on estimated tax liabilities) which can result in overpayments. These 
are included as tax assets, to be refunded in a subsequent period (2017 saw net refunds in the UK); and 
● PRT refunds were based on income realised in the preceding period, with subsequent adjustments to reflect actual profits. Following 
the reduction in the PRT rate to 0% from 1 January 2016, PRT cash movements are expected to reflect refunds, but on a less 
predictable basis. 
10. EARNINGS PER ORDINARY SHARE 
Earnings per share (EPS) is the amount of profit or loss attributable to each share. Basic EPS is the amount of profit or loss for the 
year divided by the weighted average number of shares in issue during the year. Diluted EPS includes the impact of outstanding 
share options. 
Basic earnings per ordinary share has been calculated by dividing the profit attributable to equity holders of the Company for the year of 
£333 million (2016: £1,672 million) by the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the year of 5,537 million (2016: 
5,318 million). The number of shares excludes 53 million ordinary shares (2016: 61 million), being the weighted average number of the 
Company’s own shares held in the employee share trust and treasury shares purchased by the Group as part of the share repurchase 
programme.  
The Directors believe that the presentation of adjusted basic earnings per ordinary share, being the basic earnings per ordinary share 
adjusted for certain re-measurements and exceptional items assists with understanding the underlying performance of the Group, as 
explained in note 2.  
In addition to basic and adjusted basic earnings per ordinary share, information is presented for diluted and adjusted diluted earnings per 
ordinary share. Under this presentation the weighted average number of shares used as the denominator is adjusted for potentially dilutive 
ordinary shares.

adjustment reflects the share of net exceptional items attributable to non-controlling interests. Similarly, certain re-measurement gains of £69 million (2016: £750 million) are increased by  
£1 million (2016: nil) to reflect the share of net re-measurement losses attributable to non-controlling interests. 
11. DIVIDENDS 
Dividends represent the return of profits to shareholders and are paid twice a year, in June and November. Dividends are paid as 
an amount per ordinary share held. The Group retains part of the profits generated to meet future investment plans or to fund 
share repurchase programmes.

(i) Included within the prior year final dividend are forfeited dividends of £2 million (2016: £3 million) older than 12 years that were written back in accordance with Group policy. 
The Directors propose a final dividend of 8.40 pence per ordinary share (totalling £470 million) for the year ended 31 December 2017. The 
dividend will be submitted for formal approval at the Annual General Meeting to be held on 14 May 2018 and, subject to approval, will be 
paid on 28 June 2018 to those shareholders registered on 11 May 2018. 
Since 2015, the Company has offered a scrip dividend alternative to its shareholders. £191 million of the £459 million prior year final 
dividend was in the form of ordinary shares to shareholders opting in to the scrip dividend alternative. The market value per share at the 
date of payment was £1.93 per share resulting in the issue of 99 million new shares and £185 million of share premium. 
Similarly, £7 million of the £202 million interim dividend was taken as a scrip dividend. The market value per share at the date of payment 
was £1.74 resulting in the issue of 4 million new shares and £7 million of share premium. 
The Group has sufficient distributable reserves to pay dividends to its ultimate shareholders. Distributable reserves are calculated on an 
individual legal entity basis and the ultimate parent company, Centrica plc, currently has adequate levels of realised profits within its 
retained earnings to support dividend payments. Refer to the Centrica plc Company Balance Sheet on page 191. On an annual basis, the 
distributable reserve levels of the Group’s subsidiary undertakings are reviewed and dividends paid up the ownership chain to replenish 
Centrica plc’s reserve levels.

12. ACQUISITIONS AND DISPOSALS 
(a) 2017 business combinations 
This section details business combinations made by the Group. During the year, the significant acquisitions were of Bayerngas 
Norge which was combined with the Group’s Exploration & Production business in a newly formed business, Spirit Energy, in 
which the Group has a controlling stake of 69% and REstore, a Distributed Energy & Power demand response aggregator. 
The fair values of acquired assets and liabilities are provisional unless otherwise stated. The purchase price allocation exercise requires 
management to make subjective judgements at the time control passes to the Group. 
Bayerngas Norge 
Spirit Energy Limited is the newly formed business combining the Group’s existing Exploration & Production business with that of 
Bayerngas Norge AS. This transaction was completed on 8 December 2017 with the Group owning 69% of Spirit Energy and Bayerngas 
Norge’s former shareholders owning 31%. The formation of Spirit Energy creates a strong and sustainable Exploration & Production 
business across the UK, Norway, the Netherlands and Denmark. It combines the Group’s cash generative and relatively near-term 
production profile with Bayerngas Norge’s more recently on-stream producing assets and development profile. The new business will 
invest in the range of £400-600 million per annum to deliver sustainable medium term production of 45-55 mmboe. The consideration for 
the acquisition is the 31% share of the value of the combined Exploration & Production business of Spirit Energy attributable to the non-
controlling interest that is provided in return for the Bayerngas Norge assets. This value includes cash, the value of indemnities provided 
by both parties and promises to pay further cash to fund net decommissioning liabilities of certain gas and oil fields. £102 million of 
goodwill was recognised on acquisition which predominately relates to goodwill in relation to the deferred tax liabilities recognised on 
acquisition. None of the goodwill is tax deductible. 
REstore  
On 3 November 2017, the Group acquired 100% of REstore NV’s demand response business for cash consideration of £62 million. 
REstore provides key capabilities in energy optimisation and provides over 850MW of flexible power capacity to grid operators. This power 
is aggregated from a 2.2GW flexible portfolio of industrial and commercial customers across Belgium, the UK, France and Germany, and 
generates value for businesses through ancillary services including frequency response and capacity markets. The company’s software 
and international patents are currently used by over 150 of Europe’s largest energy users. The business is a strong fit with the DE&P 
business model and provides immediate capability to the division in terms of energy insight, asset optimisation and energy solutions to 
large energy users. 
For this acquisition, the majority of the value is recognised as goodwill, which is reflective of the enhanced synergies, geographical 
presence, the assembled workforce and new and distinct capability in demand side response and management of battery equipment 
using a world class technology platform. In addition, the existing order book and future margins on renewed contracts are both captured 
in the customer intangible asset. £53 million of goodwill was recognised on acquisition, none of which is tax deductible. 
REstore reported under Belgian GAAP. Upon review of Belgian GAAP versus IFRS no material accounting policy alignments have  
been identified.

aggregated amount of £16 million.

12. ACQUISITIONS AND DISPOSALS 
Pro forma information 
The pro forma consolidated results of the Group, assuming the acquisitions had been made at the beginning of the year, would show 
revenue of £28,263 million (compared to reported revenue of £28,023 million) and profit after taxation before exceptional items and certain 
re-measurements of £702 million (compared to reported profit after taxation of £710 million). This pro forma information includes the 
revenue and profits/losses made by the acquired businesses between the beginning of the financial year and the date of the acquisition, 
without accounting policy alignments and/or the impact of the fair value uplifts resulting from purchase accounting considerations. This 
pro forma aggregated information is not necessarily indicative of the results of the combined Group that would have occurred had the 
acquisitions actually been made at the beginning of the year presented, or indicative of the future results of the combined Group. 
(b) 2016 business combinations – measurement period adjustments 
During the year, there have been no material updates to the fair value of assets and liabilities recognised for businesses acquired in 2016. 
Goodwill in respect of these acquisitions decreased by £1 million. 
(c) Assets and liabilities of disposal groups classified as held for sale 
Assets and associated liabilities that are expected to be recovered principally through a sale have been classified as held for sale 
and are presented separately on the face of the Group Balance Sheet.  
There were no disposal groups held for sale as at 31 December 2017, with items previously classified as held for sale at 31 December 
2016 (Trinidad and Tobago gas assets and Lincs Wind Farm) and 30 June 2017 (Canadian exploration and production and UK gas-fired 
power stations) disposed of during the period. 
(d) Disposals 
During the year, the Group sold its interest in the Lincs Wind Farm, Langage and South Humber power stations, Trinidad and 
Tobago gas assets and the Canadian exploration and production business. This note details the consideration received, the 
assets and liabilities disposed of and the profit/(loss) before and after tax arising on disposal.

12. ACQUISITIONS AND DISPOSALS 
On 17 February 2017, the Group sold its 50% shareholding in Lincs Wind Farm to the UK Green Investment Bank Financial Services 
managed entities and the UK Green Investment Bank plc for net consideration of £214 million. None of the consideration was contingent 
or deferred. A pre-tax profit on disposal of £64 million was recognised as an exceptional item (see note 7). The profit on disposal included 
a gain of £28 million which was recognised following cessation of the associated power purchase agreement. 
On 27 May 2017, the Group disposed of its Trinidad and Tobago gas assets to Shell Exploration and Production for net proceeds of 
US$35 million (£26 million) recording an exceptional loss on disposal of £9 million which included the recycling of losses from the foreign 
currency translation reserve of £3 million (see note 7). Contingent consideration of up to US$40 million is receivable subject to Block 22 
and NCMA-4 achieving agreed development project milestones, however no amounts have been recognised in the year. 
On 31 August 2017, the Group disposed of the Langage and South Humber Bank power stations and the King’s Lynn B new build 
development to EP UK Investments Limited for net consideration after transaction costs of £314 million. A loss on disposal of £7 million 
was recognised as an exceptional item (see note 7). The disposal loss included a loss of £14 million in relation to the settlement of 
commodity related hedges. 
On 29 September 2017, the Group disposed of its 60% interest in the CQ Energy Canada Partnership to a consortium comprising MIE 
Holding Corporation, the Can-China Global Resource Fund and Mercuria for net proceeds of C$420 million (£255 million) which resulted in 
a loss on disposal of £28 million which was recognised as an exceptional item (see note 7). The loss included recycling of losses from the 
foreign currency translation reserve of £5 million and a gain of £6 million on settlement of related commodity hedges. 
On 20 December 2017, the Group also disposed of NSIP (ETS) Limited to Antin North Sea 2 Limited for net proceeds of £15 million 
resulting in a profit on disposal of £12 million.  
All other disposals undertaken by the Group were immaterial, both individually and in aggregate. None of these disposals are material 
enough to be shown as discontinued operations on the face of the Group Income Statement as they do not represent a separate major 
line of business or material geographical area of operations.

15. OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS AND GOODWILL 
The Group Balance Sheet contains significant intangible assets. Goodwill, customer relationships and brands arise when we 
acquire a business. Goodwill is attributable to enhanced geographical presence, cost savings, synergies, growth opportunities, 
the assembled workforce and also arises from items such as deferred tax. Goodwill is not amortised but is assessed for 
recoverability each year. 
The Group uses European Union Allowances (EUAs) and Renewable Obligation Certificates (ROCs) to satisfy its related 
obligations. 
Upstream exploration and evaluation expenditure is capitalised as an intangible asset until development of the asset commences, 
at which point it is transferred to PP&E or is deemed not commercially viable and is written down.

15. OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS AND GOODWILL 
(b) Carrying amount of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives allocated to CGUs 
Goodwill acquired through business combinations, and indefinite-lived intangible assets, have been allocated for impairment testing 
purposes to individual CGUs or groups of CGUs, each representing the lowest level within the Group at which the goodwill or indefinite-
lived intangible asset is monitored for internal management purposes.

(i) The indefinite-lived assets mainly relate to the Mr Sparky and Benjamin Franklin brands acquired as part of the Clockwork business combination, and the Dyno-Rod brand. 
Further details regarding assumptions used in the impairment tests of CGUs with goodwill or indefinite-lived intangible assets allocated to 
them are provided in note S2. Sensitivities to these assumptions for goodwill allocated to the Exploration & Production CGU are provided 
in note 7(c). The impairment tests for the Connected Home and Distributed Energy & Power CGUs did not result in any impairment. These 
tests are dependent on these currently loss-making businesses becoming profitable in the future.

16. DEFERRED TAX ASSETS AND LIABILITIES 
Deferred tax is an accounting adjustment to provide for tax that is expected to arise in the future as a result of differences in the 
accounting and tax bases of assets and liabilities. The principal deferred tax assets and liabilities recognised by the Group relate 
to capital investments, decommissioning assets and provisions, tax losses, fair value movements on derivative financial 
instruments, PRT and pensions.

(i) Balances restated to show net decommissioning and losses carried forward separately from other timing differences. 
(ii) Net decommissioning includes deferred tax assets of £1,233 million (2016: £1,300 million) in respect of decommissioning provisions. 
(iii) The losses arise principally from accelerated allowances for upstream investment expenditure, for which equivalent deferred tax liabilities are included under accelerated tax depreciation. 
(iv) The deferred PRT amounts include the effect of deferred corporation tax as PRT is chargeable to corporation tax. 
Certain deferred tax assets and liabilities have been offset where there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets against 
current tax liabilities and when the deferred income taxes relate to the same fiscal authority. The following is an analysis of the gross 
deferred tax balances and associated offsetting balances for financial reporting purposes: 
31 December 
Assets 
£m 
2017 
Liabilities  
£m 
Assets 
£m

Gross deferred tax balances  2,231 (1,836) 1,725 (1,614)
Offsetting deferred tax balances  (1,663) 1,663 (1,369) 1,369
Net deferred tax balances (after offsetting for financial reporting purposes) 568 (173) 356 (245)
Deferred tax assets arise principally on decommissioning provisions, trading losses carried forward, retirement benefit obligations and 
marked to market positions. Forecasts indicate that there will be suitable taxable profits to utilise those deferred tax assets not offset 
against deferred tax liabilities. Specific legislative provisions applicable to gas and oil production provide assurance that deferred tax 
assets relating to decommissioning costs and certain trading losses will be utilised. 
At the balance sheet date the Group had certain unrecognised deductible temporary differences of £1,538 million (2016: £1,276 million), 
of which £1,538 million (2016: £1,073 million) are carried forward tax losses available for utilisation against future taxable profits. Some 
£98 million (2016: £313 million) of these losses will expire within one to five years. All other temporary differences have no expiry date.  
No deferred tax asset has been recognised in respect of these temporary differences, due to the unpredictability of future profit streams. 
At the balance sheet date, no taxable temporary differences existed in respect of the Group’s overseas investments (2016: nil). The 
deferred tax liability arising on these temporary differences is estimated to be nil (2016: nil).

17. TRADE AND OTHER RECEIVABLES 
Trade and other receivables include accrued income, and are amounts owed by our customers for goods we have delivered or 
services we have provided. These balances are valued net of provisions for bad debt. Other receivables include payments made 
in advance to our suppliers.

Receivables from residential and business customers are generally considered to be fully performing until such time as the payment that is 
due remains outstanding past the contractual due date. Contractual due dates range from falling due upon receipt to falling due in 30 
days from receipt. Receivables from residential customers are generally reviewed for impairment on an individual basis once a customer 
discontinues their relationship with the Group.

17. TRADE AND OTHER RECEIVABLES 
The provision for credit losses is based on an incurred loss model and is determined by application of expected default and loss factors, 
informed by historical loss experience and current sampling to the various balances receivable from residential and business customers on 
a portfolio basis, in addition to provisions taken against individual accounts. Balances are written off when recoverability is assessed as 
being remote. The impairment charge in trade receivables is stated net of credits for the release of specific provisions made in previous 
years, which are no longer required. These relate primarily to residential customers in the UK. Movements in the provision for credit losses 
by class are as follows:

18. INVENTORIES 
Inventories represent assets that we intend to use in future periods, either by selling the asset itself (for example gas in storage) or 
by using it to provide a service to a customer.

The Group consumed £555 million of inventories (2016: £750 million) during the year. Write-downs amounting to £7 million (2016: £10 
million) were charged to the Group Income Statement in the year. Gas held in storage amounting to £26 million is held at fair value. 
19. DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS 
  
 
The Group uses derivative financial instruments to manage the risk arising from fluctuations in the value of certain assets or 
liabilities, associated with treasury management, energy sales and procurement. These derivatives are held at fair value and are 
predominantly unrealised positions, expected to unwind in future periods. The Group also uses derivatives for proprietary energy 
trading purposes.

21. PROVISIONS FOR OTHER LIABILITIES AND CHARGES 
Provisions are recognised when an obligation exists that can be reliably measured, but where there is uncertainty over the timing 
and/or amount of the payment. The main provisions relate to decommissioning costs for upstream assets we own, or have 
owned, which require restoration or remediation. Further provisions relate to sale and purchase contracts we have entered into 
that are now onerous, restructuring costs, and legal and regulatory matters.

(i) Includes transfers to/from other balance sheet accounts including retirement benefit obligations and liabilities of disposal groups classified as held for sale. 
(ii) Provision has been made for the estimated net present cost of decommissioning gas production and storage facilities at the end of their useful lives. The estimate has been based on 2P 
reserves, price levels and technology at the balance sheet date. The timing of decommissioning payments is dependent on the lives of the facilities but is expected to occur by 2040. 
(iii) The sale/purchase contract loss provision relates mainly to a number of European gas transportation contracts and Direct Energy wind farm power purchase agreements. The majority of the 
provision is expected to be utilised by 2020. 
(iv) Other provisions have been made for dilapidations, insurance, legal and various other claims. 
22. POST-RETIREMENT BENEFITS 
The Group manages a number of final salary and career average defined benefit pension schemes. It also has defined 
contribution schemes. The majority of these schemes are in the UK.

The Centrica Engineers Pension Scheme (CEPS), Centrica Pension Plan (CPP) and Centrica Pension Scheme (CPS) form the significant 
majority of the Group’s defined benefit obligation and are referred to below as the ‘Registered Pension Schemes’. The other schemes are 
individually, and in aggregate, immaterial. 
Independent valuations 
The Registered Pension Schemes are subject to independent valuations at least every three years, on the basis of which the qualified 
actuary certifies the rate of employer contributions, which together with the specified contributions payable by the employees and 
proceeds from the schemes’ assets, are expected to be sufficient to fund the benefits payable under the schemes. 
The latest full actuarial valuations were carried out at the following dates: the Registered Pension Schemes at 31 March 2015, the Bord 
Gáis Energy Company Defined Benefit Pension Scheme at 1 January 2017 and the Direct Energy Marketing Limited Pension Plan at 1 
August 2014. These have been updated to 31 December 2017 for the purpose of meeting the requirements of IAS 19. Investments held 
in all schemes have been valued for this purpose at market value. 
Governance 
The Registered Pension Schemes are managed by trustee companies whose boards consist of both company-nominated and member-
nominated Directors. Each scheme holds units in the Centrica Combined Common Investment Fund (CCCIF), which holds the majority of 
the combined assets of the Registered Pension Schemes. The board of the CCCIF is currently comprised of nine Directors: three 
independent Directors, three Directors appointed by Centrica plc (including the Chairman) and one Director appointed by each of the three 
Registered Pension Schemes.  
Under the terms of the Pensions Act 2004, Centrica plc and each trustee board must agree the funding rate for its defined benefit pension 
scheme and a recovery plan to fund any deficit against the scheme-specific statutory funding objective. This approach was first adopted 
for the triennial valuations completed at 31 March 2006, and has been reflected in subsequent valuations, including the 31 March 2015 
valuations.

22. POST-RETIREMENT BENEFITS 
(b) Risks 
The Registered Pension Schemes expose the Group to the following risks: 
Asset volatility 
The pension liabilities are calculated using a discount rate set with reference to AA corporate bond yields. If the growth in plan assets is 
lower than this, this will create an actuarial loss within other equity. The CCCIF is responsible for managing the assets of each scheme in 
line with the liability-related investment objectives (which were updated in 2017) that have been set by the trustees of the schemes, and 
invests in a diversified portfolio of assets. The schemes are relatively young in nature (the schemes opened in 1997 on the formation of 
Centrica plc on demerger from BG plc (formerly British Gas plc), and only took on liabilities in respect of active employees). Therefore, the 
CCCIF holds a significant proportion of return-seeking assets; such assets are generally expected to provide a higher return than 
corporate bonds, but result in greater exposure to volatility and risk in the short term. The investment objectives are to achieve a long-term 
target return of 4% per annum in nominal terms, subject to a maximum level of modelled downside risk exposure.  
Interest rate  
A decrease in the bond interest rate will increase the net present value of the pension liabilities. The relative immaturity of the schemes 
means that the duration of the liabilities is longer than average for typical UK pension schemes, resulting in a relatively higher exposure to 
interest rate risk.  
Inflation 
Pensions in deferment, pensions in payment and pensions accrued under the career average schemes increase in line with the Retail 
Prices Index (RPI) and the Consumer Prices Index (CPI). Therefore scheme liabilities will increase if inflation is higher than assumed, 
although in some cases caps are in place to limit the impact of significant movements in inflation. Furthermore, a pension increase 
exchange (PIE) option implemented in 2015 is available to future retirees, which gives the choice to receive a higher initial pension in return 
for giving up certain future increases linked to RPI, again limiting the impact of significant movements in inflation.  
Longevity 
The majority of the schemes’ obligations are to provide benefits for the life of scheme members and their surviving spouses; therefore 
increases in life expectancy will result in an increase in the pension liabilities. The relative immaturity of the schemes means that there is 
comparatively little observable mortality data to assess the rates of mortality experienced by the schemes, and means that the schemes’ 
liabilities will be paid over a long period of time, making it particularly difficult to predict the life expectancy of the current membership. 
Furthermore, pension payments are subject to inflationary increases, resulting in a higher sensitivity to changes in life expectancy.  
Salary  
Pension liabilities are calculated by reference to the future salaries of active members, and hence salary rises in excess of assumed 
increases will increase scheme liabilities. During 2011, changes were introduced to the final salary sections of CEPS and CPP such that 
annual increases in pensionable pay are capped to 2%, resulting in a reduction in salary risk. During 2016, a salary cap on pensionable 
pay for the CPS career average and CPP schemes was implemented. Both the 2011 and 2016 changes result in a reduction in salary risk.  
Foreign exchange  
Certain assets held by the CCCIF are denominated in foreign currencies, and hence their values are subject to exchange rate risk.  
The CCCIF has long-term hedging policies in place to manage interest rate, inflation and foreign exchange risks. 
The table below analyses the total liabilities of the Registered Pension Schemes, calculated in accordance with accounting principles, by 
type of liability, as at 31 December 2017.

(c) Accounting assumptions 
The accounting assumptions for the Registered Pension Schemes have been given below: 
Major assumptions used for the actuarial valuation  
2017
% 
2016 
% 31 December 
Rate of increase in employee earnings: 
Subject to 2% cap 1.7 1.7
Other not subject to cap 2.3 3.2
Rate of increase in pensions in payment 3.1 3.2
Rate of increase in deferred pensions: 
In line with CPI capped at 2.5% 2.0 2.1
In line with RPI 3.1 3.2
Discount rate 2.6 2.7
The assumptions relating to longevity underlying the pension liabilities at the balance sheet date have been based on a combination of 
standard actuarial mortality tables, scheme experience and other relevant data, and include an allowance for future improvements in 
mortality. The longevity assumptions for members in normal health are as follows: 
Life expectancy at age 65 for a member  
Male
 Years 
2017 
Female 
 Years 
Male
 Years 
2016
Female
 Years 31 December 
Currently aged 65 23.0 24.6 23.2 24.9
Currently aged 45 24.5 26.1 25.0 26.8
The other demographic assumptions have been set having regard to the latest trends in scheme experience and other relevant data. The 
assumptions are reviewed and updated as necessary as part of the periodic actuarial valuations of the pension schemes. 
Marginal adjustments to the assumptions used to calculate the pension liability, or significant swings in bond yields or stock markets, can 
have a large impact in absolute terms on the net assets of the Group. Reasonably possible changes as at 31 December to one of the 
actuarial assumptions would have affected the scheme liabilities as set out below:

Discount rate 0.25% –/+6 0.25% –/+6
Inflation assumption 0.25% +/–5 0.25% +/–5
Longevity assumption 1 year +/–3 1 year +/–3
The indicative effects on scheme liabilities have been calculated by changing each assumption in isolation and assessing the impact on 
the liabilities. For the reasonably possible change in the inflation assumption, it has been assumed that a change to the inflation 
assumption would lead to corresponding changes in the assumed rates of increase in uncapped pensionable pay, pensions in payment 
and deferred pensions. 
The remaining disclosures in this note cover all of the Group’s defined benefit schemes.

(g) Pension scheme contributions 
The Group estimates that it will pay £89 million of ordinary employer contributions during 2018, at an average rate of 23% of pensionable 
pay, together with £32 million of contributions paid via the salary sacrifice arrangement. At 31 March 2015 (the date of the latest full 
actuarial valuations) the weighted average duration of the liabilities of the Registered Pension Schemes was 24 years. 
During 2016, the Group finalised the outcome of the UK Registered Pension Schemes triennial review, based on the position as at  
31 March 2015, with the Pension Trustees. The Group committed to additional annual cash contributions of £76 million for 14 years  
to fund the pension deficit which, on a Technical Provisions basis, had increased from £331 million in 2012 to £1,203 million in 2015 
primarily due to a lower discount rate used following falls in market yields. The funding is provided through a new asset-backed 
contribution arrangement with the annual contributions commencing in 2017. The existing asset-backed contribution arrangements,  
£55 million in 2017, £22 million per annum in 2018-2022 and £5 million per annum in 2023-2026 into the schemes, continue unchanged. 
A £995 million security package over certain of the Group’s assets, enforceable in the unlikely event the Group is unable to meet its 
obligations, was agreed in support of these arrangements.  
Although the Group established a new funding arrangement during 2016 based on the position as at 31 March 2015, it should be  
noted that the market rates, from which the discount rate is derived, have continued to decline in the subsequent period. The next  
UK Registered Pension Schemes triennial review will be based on the position as at 31 March 2018. The Group continues to monitor  
its pension liabilities on an ongoing basis, including assessing various scenarios that may arise and their potential implications for  
the business. 
Deficit payments are also being made in respect of the Direct Energy Marketing Limited Pension Plan in Canada. £2 million was paid in 
2017 with further annual contributions of £1 million to be paid in 2018 and 2019. 
23. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES 
(a) Commitments 
Commitments are not held on the Group’s Balance Sheet as these are executory arrangements, and relate to amounts that we 
are contractually required to pay in the future as long as the other party meets its contractual obligations. 
The Group procures commodities through a mixture of production from gas fields, power stations, wind farms and procurement 
contracts. Procurement contracts include short-term forward market purchases of gas and electricity at fixed and floating prices. They 
also include gas and electricity contracts indexed to market prices and long-term gas contracts with non-gas indexation. The 
commitments in relation to commodity purchase contracts disclosed below are stated net of amounts receivable under commodity sales 
contracts, where there is a right of offset with the counterparty.  
The total volume of gas to be taken under certain long-term structured contracts depends on a number of factors, including the actual 
reserves of gas that are eventually determined to be extractable on an economic basis. The commitments disclosed below are based on 
the minimum quantities of gas and other commodities that the Group is contracted to buy at estimated future prices. 
The commitments in this note differ in scope and in basis from the maturity analysis of energy derivatives disclosed in note S3. Whilst the 
commitments in relation to commodity purchase contracts include all purchase contracts, only certain procurement and sales contracts 
are within the scope of IAS 39 and included in note S3. In addition, the volumes used in calculating the maturity analysis in note S3 are 
estimated using valuation techniques, rather than being based on minimum contractual quantities.  
On 25 March 2013, the Group and Company announced that it had entered into a 20-year agreement with Cheniere to purchase 89bcf 
per annum of LNG volumes for export from the Sabine Pass liquefaction plant in the US, subject to a number of project milestones and 
regulatory approvals being achieved. During 2015, Cheniere made a positive final investment decision on the fifth project at Sabine Pass 
following receipt of Federal Energy Regulatory Commission approval and a Non-Free Trade Agreement licence from the Department of 
Energy. Under the terms of the agreement with Cheniere, the Group is committed to make capacity payments of £3.8 billion (included in 
‘LNG capacity’ below) between 2019 and 2039. The Group may also make up to £8.0 billion of commodity purchases based on market 
gas prices and foreign exchange rates as at the balance sheet date. The target date for first commercial delivery is estimated by the 
terminal operator as September 2019.

(b) Guarantees and indemnities 
This section discloses any guarantees and indemnities that the Group has given, where we may have to provide security in the 
future against existing and future obligations that will remain for a specific period. 
In connection with the Group’s energy trading, transportation and upstream activities, certain Group companies have entered into 
contracts under which they may be required to prepay, provide credit support or provide other collateral in the event of a significant 
deterioration in creditworthiness. The extent of credit support is contingent upon the balance owing to the third party at the point  
of deterioration. 
The Group has provided a number of securities in respect of decommissioning liabilities associated with field developments owned, or 
partly owned by Spirit Energy and its subsidiaries. These securities are provided to fellow partners and previous owners of these fields, 
who may be liable for Spirit Energy’s share of the decommissioning costs, in the event of default by the Group. The most significant 
securities relate to the Morecambe and Statfjord fields. As at 31 December 2017, £694 million of letters of credit and on demand  
payment bonds have been issued in respect of decommissioning obligations included in the Group Balance Sheet. 
As additional assets are developed or acquired, additional securities may be provided. 
(c) Contingent liabilities  
The Group has no material contingent liabilities.  
24. SOURCES OF FINANCE 
(a) Capital structure 
The Group seeks to maintain an efficient capital structure with a balance of net debt and equity as shown in the table below: 
31 December 
2017
 £m 
2016
 £m 
Net debt  2,596 3,473
Equity 2,699 2,666
Capital 5,295 6,139
Debt levels are restricted to limit the risk of financial distress and, in particular, to maintain a strong credit profile. The Group’s credit standing is 
important for several reasons: to maintain a low cost of debt, limit collateral requirements in energy trading, hedging and decommissioning 
security arrangements, and to ensure the Group is an attractive counterparty to energy producers and long-term customers. 
The Group monitors its current and projected capital position on a regular basis, considering a medium-term view of three to five years, 
and different stress case scenarios, including the impact of changes in the Group’s credit ratings and significant movements in commodity 
prices. A number of financial ratios are monitored, including those used by the credit rating agencies.  
The level of debt that can be raised by the Group is restricted by the Company’s Articles of Association. Borrowings is limited to the higher 
of £10 billion and a gearing ratio of three times adjusted capital and reserves. The Group funds its long-term debt requirements through 
issuing bonds in the capital markets and taking bank debt. Short-term debt requirements are met primarily through issuance of 
commercial paper. The Group maintains substantial committed facilities and uses these to provide liquidity for general corporate 
purposes, including short-term business requirements and back-up for commercial paper. 
British Gas Insurance Limited (BGIL) is required under PRA regulations to hold a minimum capital amount and has complied with this 
requirement in 2017 (and 2016). BGIL’s capital management policy and plan is subject to review and approval by BGIL’s board. Reporting 
processes provide relevant and timely capital information to management and the board. A medium-term capital management plan forms 
a part of BGIL’s planning and forecasting process, embedded into approved timelines, management reviews and board approvals. 
In the period from 2015-2017, the Group has reduced its overall levels of net debt, in accordance with its strategic objectives and financial 
framework. This has resulted in an increase in overall levels of cash held. The Group regularly reviews its cash and gross debt positions 
and considers opportunities for early retirement of debt in order to maintain a more efficient balance sheet. 
(b) Liquidity risk management and going concern 
The Group has a number of treasury and risk policies to monitor and manage liquidity risk. Cash forecasts identifying the Group’s liquidity 
requirements are produced regularly and are stress-tested for different scenarios, including, but not limited to, reasonably possible 
increases or decreases in commodity prices and the potential cash implications of a credit rating downgrade. The Group seeks to ensure 
that sufficient financial headroom exists for at least a 12-month period to safeguard the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern. It is 
the Group’s policy to maintain committed facilities and/or available surplus cash resources of at least £1,200 million, raise at least 75% of 
its net debt (excluding non-recourse debt) in the long-term debt market and to maintain an average term to maturity in the recourse long-
term debt portfolio greater than five years.  
At 31 December 2017, the Group had undrawn committed credit facilities of £3,530 million (2016: £4,497 million) and £2,664 million 
(2016: £1,881 million) of unrestricted cash and cash equivalents. 238% (2016: 186%) of the Group’s net debt has been raised in the long-
term debt market and the average term to maturity of the long-term debt portfolio was 10.8 years (2016: 11.6 years). 
The Group’s liquidity is impacted by the cash posted or received under margin and collateral agreements. The terms and conditions of 
these depend on the counterparty and the specific details of the transaction. Cash is generally returned to the Group or by the Group 
within two days of trade settlement. Refer to note 24(c) for the movement in cash posted or received as collateral.

24. SOURCES OF FINANCE 
The relatively high level of undrawn committed bank facilities and available cash resources has enabled the Directors to conclude that the 
Group has sufficient headroom to continue as a going concern. The statement of going concern is included in the Governance section – 
Other Statutory Information, on page 100. 
(c) Net debt summary 
Net debt predominantly includes capital market borrowings offset by cash, cash posted or received as collateral, securities and 
certain hedging financial instruments used to manage interest rate and foreign exchange movements on borrowings.

(i) Comparatives have been re-presented to be consistent with the current year presentation where the cash flow related to financing interest has been separately disclosed in accordance with 
the amendment to IAS 7: ‘Statement of cash flows’, which has been adopted this year. 
(ii) Cash and cash equivalents includes £200 million (2016: £155 million) of restricted cash, mostly held by the Group’s insurance undertakings that is not readily available to be used for other 
purposes within the Group. This includes cash totalling £65 million (2016: nil) within the Spirit Energy business that is not restricted by regulation but is managed by its own treasury 
department. 
(iii) Cash and cash equivalents are net of £127 million bank overdrafts (2016: £76 million). This is offset by a corresponding gross up in current borrowings. 
(iv) Collateral is posted or received to support energy trading and procurement activities. It is posted when contracts with marginable counterparties are out of the money and is received when 
contracts are in the money. These positions reverse when contracts are settled and the collateral is returned. Of the net cash collateral posted as at 31 December 2017, £29 million (2016: 
£21 million) is included within trade and other payables, £253 million (2016: £307 million) within trade and other receivables, and £112 million (2016: £210 million) has been settled against net 
derivative financial liabilities. The items to which the cash posted or received as collateral under margin and collateral agreements relate are not included within net debt.  
(v) Securities balances include £128 million (2016: £130 million) of index-linked gilts which the Group uses for short-term liquidity management purposes and £108 million (2016: £102 million) of 
available-for-sale financial assets. The Group has posted £29 million (2016: £29 million) of non-current securities as collateral against an index-linked swap maturing on 16 April 2020. 
(vi) Includes sale of shares in Enercare Inc. which were sold in 2016 for consideration of C$61 million (£31 million). 
(vii) Including non-cash movements relating to the reversal of collateral amounts posted when the related derivative contract settles (where these daily margin amounts posted reduce the ultimate 
amount payable/receivable on settlement of the related derivative contract).

regulation. 
S1. GENERAL INFORMATION 
Centrica plc (the ‘Company’) is a public company limited by shares, domiciled and incorporated in the UK, and registered in England and 
Wales. The address of the registered office is Millstream, Maidenhead Road, Windsor, Berkshire, SL4 5GD. The Company, together with 
its subsidiaries comprise the ‘Group’. The nature of the Group’s operations and principal activities are set out in note 4(a) and on pages 2 
to 62. 
The consolidated Financial Statements of Centrica plc are presented in pounds sterling. Operations and transactions conducted in 
currencies other than pounds sterling are included in the consolidated Financial Statements in accordance with the foreign currencies 
accounting policy set out in note S2. 
S2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES  
This section sets out the Group’s significant accounting policies in addition to the critical accounting policies applied in the 
preparation of these consolidated Financial Statements. These accounting policies have been consistently applied to the years 
presented. 
Income Statement presentation 
The Group Income Statement and segmental note separately identify the effects of re-measurement of certain financial instruments and 
items that are exceptional, in order to provide readers with a clear and consistent presentation of the Group’s underlying performance, as 
described in note 2. 
Basis of consolidation 
The Group Financial Statements consolidate the Financial Statements of the Company and entities controlled by the Company. 
Subsidiaries are all entities (including structured entities) over which the Group has control. Control is exercised over an entity when the 
Group is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns 
through its power over the entity. Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the Group. They are 
deconsolidated from the date that control ceases. Transactions with non-controlling interests that relate to their ownership interests and 
do not result in a loss of control are accounted for as equity transactions. 
The results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the year are consolidated from the effective date of acquisition (at which point 
the Group gains control over a business as defined by IFRS 3, and applies the acquisition method to account for the transaction as a 
business combination) or up to the effective date of disposal, as appropriate. Where necessary, adjustments are made to the Financial 
Statements of subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures to align the accounting policies with those used by the Group. 
When the Group ceases to have control, any retained interest in the entity is re-measured to its fair value with the change in carrying 
amount recognised in profit or loss. This fair value becomes the initial carrying amount for the purposes of subsequently accounting for the 
retained interest as a joint venture, associate or financial asset. 
Segmental reporting 
The Group’s operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to and regularly reviewed by the 
Group’s Executive Committee for the purposes of evaluating segment performance and allocating resources. 
Revenue 
Revenue is recognised to the extent that it is probable that the economic benefits will flow to the Group and the revenue can be measured 
reliably. Revenue includes amounts receivable for goods and services provided in the normal course of business, net of discounts, 
rebates, VAT and other sales-related taxes. 
Energy supply: revenue is recognised on the basis of energy supplied during the year. Revenue for energy supply activities includes an 
assessment of energy supplied to customers between the date of the last meter reading and the year end (known as unread revenue). 
Unread gas and electricity is estimated using historical consumption patterns, taking into account the industry reconciliation process for 
total gas and total electricity usage by supplier, and is included in accrued energy income within trade and other receivables. 
Proprietary energy trading: revenue comprises both realised (settled) and unrealised (fair value changes) net gains and losses from trading 
in physical and financial energy contracts. 
Wholesale energy: revenue in the North America Business segment is presented on a gross basis, reflecting revenue arising from the re-
trading of energy in addition to physical supply.  
Fixed-fee service and insurance contracts: revenue from these contracts is recognised in the Group Income Statement with regard to the 
incidence of risk over the life of the contract, reflecting the seasonal propensity of claims to be made under the contracts and the benefits 
receivable by the customer, which span the life of the contract as a result of emergency maintenance being available throughout the 
contract term. 
Amounts paid in advance are treated as deferred income, with any amount in arrears recognised as accrued income. For one-off services, 
such as installations, revenue is recognised at the date of service provision. 
Storage services: storage capacity revenues are recognised evenly over the contract period, whilst commodity revenues for the injection 
and withdrawal of gas are recognised at the point of gas flowing into or out of the storage facilities. Gas purchases and gas sales 
transactions entered into to optimise the performance of the gas storage facilities are presented net within cost of sales. Cushion gas 
sales revenue is recognised when the gas is transferred to the customer account or sold to the market.

Centrica plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 | 159 
S2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES  
Upstream production: revenue associated with exploration and production sales (of natural gas, crude oil and condensates) is recognised 
when title passes to the customer. Revenue from the production of natural gas, oil and condensates in which the Group has an interest 
with other producers is recognised based on the Group’s working interest and the terms of the relevant production sharing arrangements 
(the entitlement method). Where differences arise between production sold and the Group’s share of production, this is accounted for  
as an overlift or underlift (see separate accounting policy). Purchases and sales entered into to optimise the performance of production 
facilities are presented net within revenue. 
Power generation: revenue is recognised on the basis of power supplied during the year. Power purchases and sales entered into to 
optimise the performance of power generation facilities are presented net within revenue. 
Cost of sales 
Energy supply includes the cost of gas and electricity produced and purchased during the year, taking into account the industry 
reconciliation process for total gas and total electricity usage by supplier and related transportation, distribution, royalty costs and bought-
in materials and services. 
Cost of sales relating to fixed-fee service and insurance contracts includes direct labour and related overheads on installation work, repairs 
and service contracts in the year. 
Cost of sales relating to gas and oil production includes depreciation of assets used in production of gas and oil, royalty costs and direct 
labour costs. 
Cost of sales within power generation businesses includes the depreciation of assets included in generating power, fuel purchase costs, 
direct labour costs and carbon emissions costs. 
Financing costs 
Financing costs that arise in connection with the acquisition, construction or production of a qualifying asset are capitalised and 
subsequently amortised in line with the depreciation of the related asset. Financing costs are capitalised from the time of acquisition or 
from the beginning of construction or production until the point at which the qualifying asset is ready for use. Where a specific financing 
arrangement is in place, the specific borrowing rate for that arrangement is applied. For non-specific financing arrangements, a Group 
financing rate representative of the weighted average borrowing rate of the Group is used (2017: 4.55%, 2016: 4.53%). Financing costs 
not arising in connection with the acquisition, construction or production of a qualifying asset are expensed. 
Investment income 
Interest income is accrued on a time basis, by reference to the principal outstanding and at the effective interest rate applicable, which 
is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash receipts through the expected life of the financial asset to that asset’s net 
carrying value. 
Foreign currencies 
The consolidated Financial Statements are presented in pounds sterling, which is the functional currency of the Company and the Group’s 
presentational currency. Each entity in the Group determines its own functional currency and items included in the Financial Statements of 
each entity are measured using that functional currency. Transactions in foreign currencies are, on initial recognition, recorded in the 
functional currency of the entity at the exchange rate ruling at the date of the transaction.  
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the functional currency rate of exchange ruling at the 
balance sheet date. All exchange movements are included in the Group Income Statement for the period. In previous periods, the Group 
utilised net investment hedging and exchange differences on foreign currency borrowings and derivatives that provided a hedge against 
a net investment in a foreign entity were taken directly to equity. Upon the disposal or partial disposal of the net investment, any 
accumulated foreign exchange reserves related to the investment are recognised in the Group Income Statement. The Group no longer 
uses net investment hedging but historic exchange differences remain in equity until the disposal of the specific investments. 
Non-monetary items that are measured at historical cost in a currency other than the functional currency of the entity concerned are 
translated using the exchange rate prevailing at the dates of the initial transaction. 
For the purpose of presenting consolidated Financial Statements, the assets and liabilities of the Group’s non-sterling functional currency 
subsidiary undertakings, joint ventures and associates are translated into pounds sterling at exchange rates prevailing at the balance sheet 
date. The results of these (generally foreign) subsidiary undertakings, joint ventures and associates are translated into pounds sterling at 
the average rates of exchange for the relevant period. The relevant exchange rates are shown below:

S2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES  
Exchange adjustments arising from the retranslation of the opening net assets and results of non-sterling functional currency operations 
are transferred to the Group’s foreign currency translation reserve, a separate component of equity, and are reported in the Statement of 
Comprehensive Income. In the event of the disposal of a non-sterling functional currency subsidiary, the cumulative translation difference 
arising in the foreign currency translation reserve is charged or credited to the Group Income Statement on disposal. 
Employee share schemes 
The Group operates a number of employee share schemes, detailed in the Remuneration Report on pages 78 to 89, under which it 
makes equity-settled share-based payments to certain employees. Equity-settled share-based payments are measured at fair value at the 
date of grant (excluding the effect of non-market based vesting conditions). The fair value determined at the grant date is expensed on a 
straight-line basis together with a corresponding increase in equity over the vesting period, based on the Group’s estimate of the number 
of awards that will vest, and adjusted for the effect of non-market based vesting conditions. 
The majority of the share-based payment charge arises from the following schemes. More information is included in the Remuneration 
Report on pages 78 to 89. 
Deferred Matching Share Scheme (DMSS): 
● Applicable employees: Senior Executive Group. 
● From 2015 this scheme was replaced by the Annual Incentive Plan (AIP) and Long Term Incentive Plan (LTIP) for Executive Directors

Sharesave: 
● Applicable employees: All UK and Ireland employees. 
● Options granted with a fixed exercise price equal to 80% of the average market price of the shares for three days prior to invitation 
which is three to four weeks prior to the grant date. 
● Employees pay a monthly fixed amount into a savings account and may elect to save over three or five years. At the end of the savings 
period, employees have six months to exercise their options or withdraw the saved funds. 
For each of the schemes, the fair value is measured using the market value on the date of the grant. 
Business combinations and goodwill 
The acquisition of subsidiaries is accounted for using the acquisition method (at the point the Group gains control over a business as 
defined by IFRS 3). The cost of the acquisition is measured as the cash paid and the aggregate of the fair values, at the date of exchange, 
of other assets transferred, liabilities incurred or assumed, and equity instruments issued by the Group in exchange for control of the 
acquiree. The consideration transferred includes the fair value of any asset or liability resulting from a contingent consideration 
arrangement at the acquisition date. 
Acquisition-related costs are expensed as incurred. The acquiree’s identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities that meet the 
conditions for recognition under IFRS 3, are recognised at their fair value at the acquisition date, except for non-current assets (or disposal 
groups) that are classified as held for sale in accordance with IFRS 5, which are recognised and measured at FVLCD. The Group 
recognises any non-controlling interests in the acquiree on an acquisition-by-acquisition basis, either at fair value or at the non-controlling 
interests’ proportionate share of the recognised amounts of acquiree’s identifiable net assets. 
Goodwill arising on a business combination represents the excess of the consideration transferred, the amount of the non-controlling 
interests and the acquisition date fair value of any previously held interest in the acquiree over the Group’s interest in the fair value of the 
identifiable net assets acquired. Goodwill arising on the acquisition of a stake in a joint venture or an associate represents the excess of 
the consideration transferred over the Group’s interest in the fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities of the investee at the date of 
acquisition. Goodwill is initially recognised as an asset at cost and is subsequently measured at cost less any accumulated impairment 
losses. The goodwill arising on an investment in a joint venture or in an associate is not recognised separately, but is shown under 
‘Interests in joint ventures and associates’ in the Group Balance Sheet. If, after reassessment, the Group’s interest in the net fair value of 
the acquiree’s identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities exceeds the cost of the business combination, the excess is 
recognised immediately in the Group Income Statement. 
Acquisitions of joint operations that meet the definition of a business as defined in IFRS 3 are accounted for as a business combination.  
On disposal of a subsidiary, associate or joint venture entity, any amount of goodwill attributed to that entity is included in the 
determination of the profit or loss on disposal. A similar accounting treatment is applied on disposal of assets that represent a business. 
Other intangible assets 
Intangible assets acquired separately are measured on initial recognition at cost. Intangible assets include contractual customer 
relationships, brands, application software, emissions trading schemes, renewable obligation certificates, and certain exploration and 
evaluation expenditures, the accounting policies for which are dealt with separately below. For purchased application software, for 
example investments in customer relationship management and billing systems, cost includes contractors’ charges, materials, directly 
attributable labour and directly attributable overheads.  
Capitalisation begins when expenditure for the asset is being incurred and activities necessary to prepare the asset for use are in 
progress. Capitalisation ceases when substantially all the activities that are necessary to prepare the asset for use are complete. 
Amortisation commences at the point of commercial deployment. The cost of intangible assets acquired in a business combination is their 
fair value as at the date of acquisition. 
Following initial recognition, intangible assets are carried at cost less any accumulated amortisation and any accumulated impairment 
losses. The useful lives of intangible assets are assessed to be either finite or indefinite. Intangible assets with finite lives are amortised over 
their useful lives and are tested for impairment annually, otherwise they are assessed for impairment whenever there is an indication that 
the intangible asset could be impaired. The amortisation period and the amortisation method for an intangible asset are reviewed at each 
financial year end. Changes in the expected useful life or the expected pattern of consumption of future economic benefits embodied in 
the asset are accounted for on a prospective basis by changing the amortisation period or method, as appropriate, and treated as 
changes in accounting estimates. 
Intangible assets are derecognised on disposal, or when no future economic benefits are expected from their use. 
Intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are tested for impairment annually, and whenever there is an indication that the intangible asset 
could be impaired, either individually or at the CGU level. Such intangibles are not amortised. The useful life of an intangible asset with an 
indefinite useful life is reviewed annually to determine whether the indefinite life assessment continues to be supportable. If not, the change 
in the useful life assessment from indefinite to finite is made on a prospective basis. 
The useful economic lives for the principal categories of intangible assets are as follows: 
Customer relationships and other contractual assets Up to 20 years 
Strategic identifiable acquired brands  Indefinite 
Application software Up to 15 years

EU Emissions Trading Scheme and renewable obligation certificates 
Purchased carbon dioxide emissions allowances are recognised initially at cost (purchase price) within intangible assets. The liability is 
measured at the cost of purchased allowances up to the level of purchased allowances held, and then at the market price of allowances 
ruling at the balance sheet date, with movements in the liability recognised in operating profit. 
Forward contracts for the purchase or sale of carbon dioxide emissions allowances are measured at fair value with gains and losses 
arising from changes in fair value recognised in the Group Income Statement. The intangible asset is surrendered and the liability is 
extinguished at the end of the compliance period to reflect the consumption of economic benefits. 
Purchased renewable obligation certificates are recognised initially at cost within intangible assets. A liability for the renewables obligation 
is recognised based on the level of electricity supplied to customers, and is calculated in accordance with percentages set by the UK 
Government and the renewable obligation certificate buyout price for that period. 
The intangible asset is surrendered and the liability is extinguished at the end of the compliance period to reflect the consumption of 
economic benefits. Any recycling benefit related to the submission of renewable obligation certificates is recognised in the Group Income 
Statement when received. 
Exploration, evaluation, development and production assets 
The Group uses the successful efforts method of accounting for exploration and evaluation expenditure. Exploration and evaluation 
expenditure associated with an exploration well, including acquisition costs related to exploration and evaluation activities are capitalised 
initially as intangible assets. Certain expenditures such as geological and geophysical exploration costs are expensed. If the prospects are 
subsequently determined to be successful on completion of evaluation, the relevant expenditure including licence acquisition costs is 
transferred to PP&E. If the prospects are subsequently determined to be unsuccessful on completion of evaluation, the associated costs 
are expensed in the period in which that determination is made.  
All field development costs are capitalised as PP&E. Such costs relate to the acquisition and installation of production facilities and include 
development drilling costs, project-related engineering and other technical services costs. PP&E, including rights and concessions related 
to production activities, are depreciated from the commencement of production in the fields concerned, using the unit of production 
method, based on all of the 2P reserves of those fields. Changes in these estimates are dealt with prospectively.  
The net carrying value of fields in production and development is compared annually on a field-by-field basis with the likely discounted 
future net revenues to be derived from the remaining commercial reserves. An impairment loss is recognised where it is considered that 
recorded amounts are unlikely to be fully recovered from the net present value of future net revenues. Exploration assets are reviewed 
annually for indicators of impairment and production and development assets are tested annually for impairment. 
Interests in joint arrangements and associates 
Under IFRS 11, joint arrangements are those that convey joint control, which exists only when decisions about the relevant activities 
require the unanimous consent of the parties sharing control. Investments in joint arrangements are classified as either joint operations or 
joint ventures depending on the contractual rights and obligations of each investor. Associates are investments over which the Group has 
significant influence but not control or joint control, which are generally investments in which the Group holds between 20% and 50% of 
the voting rights. The Group’s joint ventures and associates (as defined in note 6) are accounted for using the equity method.  
Under the equity method, investments are carried at cost plus post-acquisition changes in the Group’s share of net assets, less any 
impairment in value in individual investments. The Group Income Statement reflects the Group’s share of the results of operations after  
tax and interest. Adjustments are made to the results and net assets of the joint ventures and associates where necessary to ensure 
consistency with the accounting policies adopted by the Group. Upon initial acquisition goodwill may arise and is recognised within 
‘Interests in joint ventures and associates’ in the Group Balance Sheet. 
The Group’s interests in joint operations (gas and oil exploration and production licence arrangements) are accounted for by recognising 
its assets (including its share of assets held jointly), its liabilities (including its share of liabilities incurred jointly), its revenue from the sale of 
its share of the output arising from the joint operation, its share of the revenue from the sale of the output by the joint operation and its 
expenses (including its share of any expenses incurred jointly). 
Where the Group has an equity stake or a participating interest in operations governed by a joint arrangement for which it is acting as 
operator, an assessment is carried out to confirm whether the Group is acting as agent or principal. As the terms and conditions 
negotiated between business partners usually provide joint control to the parties over the relevant activities of the gas and oil fields that are 
governed by joint arrangements, the Group is usually deemed to be an agent when it is appointed as operator and not as principal (as the 
contracts entered into do not convey control to the parties). Accordingly, the Group recognises its interests in these arrangements as 
outlined above except that it presents gross liabilities and gross receivables of joint operations (including amounts due to or from non-
operating partners) in the Group Balance Sheet in accordance with the netting rules of IAS 32.

S2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES  
Property, plant and equipment 
PP&E is included in the Group Balance Sheet at cost, less accumulated depreciation and any provisions for impairment. The initial cost of 
an asset comprises its purchase price or construction cost and any costs directly attributable to bringing the asset into operation. The 
purchase price or construction cost is the aggregate amount paid and the fair value of any other consideration given to acquire the asset. 
Subsequent expenditure in respect of items of PP&E, such as the replacement of major parts, major inspections or overhauls, are 
capitalised as part of the cost of the related asset where it is probable that future economic benefits will arise as a result of the expenditure 
and the cost can be reliably measured. All other subsequent expenditure, including the costs of day-to-day servicing, repairs and 
maintenance, is expensed as incurred. 
Freehold land is not depreciated. Other PP&E, with the exception of upstream production assets (see above), are depreciated on a 
straight-line basis at rates sufficient to write off the cost, less estimated residual values, of individual assets over their estimated useful 
lives. The depreciation periods for the principal categories of assets are as follows: 
Freehold and leasehold buildings Up to 50 years 
Plant Five to 20 years 
Equipment and vehicles Three to 10 years 
Power generation assets Up to 30 years 
Gas storage assets 
(i)
 Up to 40 years 
(i) The depreciation policy for the Group’s UK Storage assets has remained unchanged during 2017. However, following the granting of consent from the Oil and Gas Authority confirming 
transition from a storage operation into one of production on 17 January 2018, this policy will change to be consistent with the unit of production method used by production assets in 2018. 
Assets held under finance leases are depreciated over their expected useful lives on the same basis as for owned assets or, where 
shorter, the lease term. 
The carrying values of PP&E are tested annually for impairment and are reviewed for impairment when events or changes in circumstances 
indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Residual values and useful lives are reassessed annually and, if necessary, changes 
are accounted for prospectively. 
Impairment assumptions 
Details of the approach taken to impairment are included in note 7(c). The following provides further information on the assumptions used 
in the VIU calculations: 
VIU – Key assumptions used 
The VIU calculations use pre-tax cash flow projections based on the Group’s Board-approved business plans for five years (except for 
Central Power Generation CCGTs). The Group’s business plans are based on past experience and adjusted to reflect market trends, 
economic conditions, key risks, the implementation of strategic objectives and changes in commodity prices, as appropriate. Commodity 
prices used in the planning process are based in part on observable market data and in part on internal estimates. The extent to which the 
commodity prices used in the business plans are based on observable market data is determined by the extent to which the market for 
the underlying commodity is judged to be active. Note S6 provides additional detail on the active period of each of the commodity 
markets in which the Group operates.  
(a) VIU – Growth rates and discount rates 
Cash flows beyond the planned period have been extrapolated using long-term growth rates in the market where the CGU operates. 
Long-term growth rates are determined using a blend of publicly available historical data and long-term growth rate forecasts published by 
external analysts. Cash flows are discounted using a discount rate specific to each CGU. Discount rates reflect the current market 
assessments of the time value of money and are based on the estimated cost of capital of each CGU. Additionally, risks specific to the 
cash flows of the CGUs are reflected within cash flow forecasts. Each CGU’s weighted average cost of capital is then adjusted to reflect 
the impact of tax in order to calculate an equivalent pre-tax discount rate. 
Long-term growth rates and pre-tax discount rates used in the VIU calculations for each of the Group’s CGUs are provided in the  
table below:

(b) VIU – Inflation rates 
Inflation rates used in the business plan were based on a blend of a number of publicly available inflation forecasts for the UK, Canada, the 
Republic of Ireland and the US. Inflation rates used for the VIU calculations were as follows: UK 2.6% (2016: 2.0%); Canada 2.0% (2016: 
2.1%); Republic of Ireland 1.5% (2016: 1.5%); and the US 2.3% (2016: 2.2%). 
(c) Key operating assumptions by CGUs using VIU 
The key operating assumptions across all CGUs are gross margin, revenues and operating costs. Each of these assumptions is tailored to 
the specific CGU using management’s knowledge of the environment, as shown in the table below:

S2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES  
Overlift and underlift 
Off-take arrangements for gas and oil produced from joint operations are often such that it is not practical for each participant to receive 
or sell its precise share of the overall production during the period. This results in short-term imbalances between cumulative production 
entitlement and cumulative sales, referred to as overlift and underlift. 
An overlift payable, or underlift receivable, is recognised at the balance sheet date within trade and other payables or trade and other 
receivables respectively, and is measured at market value, with movements in the period recognised within cost of sales.  
Leases 
The determination of whether an arrangement is, or contains, a lease is based on the substance of the arrangement and requires an 
assessment of whether the fulfilment of the arrangement is dependent on the use of a specific asset or assets and whether the 
arrangement conveys a right to use the asset or assets. Leases are classified as finance leases whenever the terms of the lease transfer 
substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership to the lessee. All other leases are classified as operating leases. Assets held under 
finance leases are capitalised and included in PP&E at their fair value, or if lower, at the present value of the minimum lease payments, 
each determined at the inception of the lease. The obligations relating to finance leases, net of finance charges in respect of future 
periods, are included within bank loans and other borrowings, with the amount payable within 12 months included in bank overdrafts, 
loans and other borrowings within current liabilities. 
Lease payments are apportioned between finance charges and the reduction of the finance lease obligation so as to achieve a constant 
rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability. Finance charges are charged directly against income. 
Payments under operating leases are charged to the Group Income Statement on a straight-line basis over the term of the relevant lease. 
Inventories 
Inventories of finished goods are valued at the lower of cost or estimated net realisable value after allowance for redundant and slow-
moving items. The cost of inventories includes the purchase price plus costs of conversion incurred in bringing the inventories to their 
present location and condition. 
Inventory of gas in storage is valued either on a weighted average cost basis or at fair value less any costs to sell depending on the 
business model for holding the inventory. Changes in fair value less costs to sell are recognised in the Group Income Statement.

S2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES  
Decommissioning costs 
Provision is made for the net present value of the estimated cost of decommissioning gas and oil production facilities at the end of the 
producing lives of fields, and storage facilities and power stations at the end of their useful lives, based on price levels and technology at 
the balance sheet date. 
When this provision relates to an asset with sufficient future economic benefits, a decommissioning asset is recognised and included as 
part of the associated PP&E and depreciated accordingly. If there is an indication that the new carrying amount of the asset is not fully 
recoverable, the asset is tested for impairment and an impairment loss is recognised where necessary. Changes in these estimates and 
changes to the discount rates are dealt with prospectively and reflected as an adjustment to the provision and corresponding 
decommissioning asset included within PP&E. The unwinding of the discount on the provision is included in the Group Income Statement 
within financing costs. 
Non-current assets and disposal groups held for sale and discontinued operations 
Non-current assets and disposal groups classified as held for sale are measured at the lower of carrying amount and fair value less costs 
of disposal. No depreciation is charged in respect of non-current assets classified as held for sale. 
Non-current assets and disposal groups are classified as held for sale if their carrying amount will be recovered through a sale transaction 
rather than through continuing use. This condition is regarded as met only when the sale is highly probable, the asset or disposal group is 
available for immediate sale in its present condition and the Directors are committed to the sale which should be expected to qualify for 
recognition as a completed sale within one year from the date of classification. 
The profits or losses and cash flows that relate to a major component of the Group that has been sold or is classified as held for sale  
are presented separately from continuing operations as discontinued operations within the Group Income Statement and Group Cash 
Flow Statement. 
Pensions and other post-employment benefits 
The Group operates a number of defined benefit and defined contribution pension schemes. The cost of providing benefits under the 
defined benefit schemes is determined separately for each scheme using the projected unit credit actuarial valuation method. Actuarial 
gains and losses are recognised in the period in which they occur in the Group Statement of Comprehensive Income. 
The cost of providing retirement pensions and other benefits is charged to the Group Income Statement over the periods benefiting from 
employees’ service. Past service cost is recognised immediately. Costs of administering the schemes are charged to the Group Income 
Statement. Net interest, being the change in the net defined benefit liability or asset due to the passage of time, is recognised in the Group 
Income Statement within net finance cost. 
The net defined benefit liability or asset recognised in the Group Balance Sheet represents the present value of the defined benefit 
obligation of the schemes and the fair value of the schemes’ assets. The present value of the defined benefit obligation is determined by 
discounting the estimated future cash outflows using interest rates of high-quality corporate bonds that are denominated in the currency  
in which the benefits are paid, and that have terms of maturity approximating to the terms of the related pension liability. 
Payments to defined contribution retirement benefit schemes are recognised in the Group Income Statement as they fall due. 
Provisions 
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past event, that can be 
measured reliably, and it is probable that the Group will be required to settle that obligation. Provisions are measured at the best  
estimate of the expenditure required to settle the obligation at the balance sheet date and are discounted to present value where  
the effect is material. 
Where discounting is used, the increase in the provision due to the passage of time is recognised in the Group Income Statement within 
interest expense. Onerous contract provisions are recognised where the unavoidable costs of meeting the obligations under a contract 
exceed the economic benefits expected to be received under it. Contracts to purchase or sell energy are reviewed on a portfolio basis 
given the fungible nature of energy, whereby it is assumed that the highest priced purchase contract supplies the highest priced sales 
contract and the lowest priced sales contract is supplied by the lowest priced purchase contract. 
Taxation 
Current tax, including UK corporation tax, UK petroleum revenue tax and foreign tax is provided at amounts expected to be paid (or 
recovered) using the tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date. From time to time, 
the Group may have open tax issues with a number of revenue authorities. Where an outflow of funds is believed to be probable and a 
reliable estimate of the dispute can be made, management provides for its best estimate of the liability. These estimates take into account 
the specific circumstances of each dispute and relevant external advice. Each item is considered separately and on a basis that provides 
the better prediction of the outcome. See note 9 for further detail on uncertain tax provisions. 
Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all temporary differences identified at the balance sheet date, except to the extent that the 
deferred tax arises from the initial recognition of goodwill (if impairment of goodwill is not deductible for tax purposes) or the initial 
recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction which is not a business combination and at the time of the transaction affects 
neither accounting profit nor taxable profit and loss. Temporary differences are differences between the carrying amount of the Group’s 
assets and liabilities and their tax base.  
Deferred tax liabilities may be offset against deferred tax assets within the same taxable entity or qualifying local tax group. Any remaining 
deferred tax asset is recognised only when, on the basis of all available evidence, it can be regarded as probable that there will be suitable 
taxable profits, within the same jurisdiction, in the foreseeable future, against which the deductible temporary difference can be utilised.

Centrica plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 | 167 
S2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES  
Deferred tax is provided on temporary differences arising on subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates, except where the timing of the 
reversal of the temporary difference can be controlled and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future. 
Deferred tax is measured at the average tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which the asset is realised or liability settled, 
based on tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date. Measurement of deferred tax 
liabilities and assets reflects the tax consequences expected from the manner in which the asset or liability is recovered or settled. 
Financial instruments  
Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised in the Group Balance Sheet when the Group becomes a party to the contractual 
provisions of the instrument. Financial assets are derecognised when the Group no longer has the rights to cash flows, the risks and 
rewards of ownership or control of the asset. Financial liabilities are derecognised when the obligation under the liability is discharged, 
cancelled or expires. 
(a) Trade receivables 
Trade receivables are initially recognised at fair value, which is usually the original invoice amount, and are subsequently held at amortised 
cost using the effective interest method less an allowance for any uncollectible amounts. Provision is made when there is objective 
evidence that the Group may not be able to collect the trade receivable. Balances are written off when recoverability is assessed as being 
remote. If collection is due in one year or less, receivables are classified as current assets. If not they are presented as non-current assets. 
(b) Trade payables 
Trade payables are initially recognised at fair value, which is usually the original invoice amount and are subsequently held at amortised 
cost using the effective interest method. If payment is due within one year or less, payables are classified as current liabilities. If not they 
are presented as non-current liabilities. 
(c) Share capital 
Ordinary shares are classified as equity. Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares are shown in equity as a deduction 
from the proceeds received. Own equity instruments that are reacquired (treasury or own shares) are deducted from equity. No gain or loss is 
recognised in the Group Income Statement on the purchase, sale, issue or cancellation of the Group’s own equity instruments.  
(d) Cash and cash equivalents 
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash in hand and current balances with banks and similar institutions, which are readily convertible to 
known amounts of cash and which are subject to insignificant risk of changes in value and have an original maturity of three months or less. 
Cash and cash equivalents are presented net of outstanding bank overdrafts where there is a legal right of set off and, for the Group’s cash 
pooling arrangements, to the extent the Group expects to settle its subsidiaries’ year-end account balances on a net basis. 
For the purpose of the Group Cash Flow Statement, cash and cash equivalents consist of cash and cash equivalents as defined above, 
net of outstanding bank overdrafts.  
(e) Interest-bearing loans and other borrowings 
All interest-bearing loans and other borrowings with banks and similar institutions are initially recognised at fair value net of directly 
attributable transaction costs. After initial recognition, interest-bearing loans and other borrowings are subsequently measured at 
amortised cost using the effective interest method, except when they are hedged items in an effective fair value hedge relationship where 
the carrying value is also adjusted to reflect the fair value movements associated with the hedged risks. Such fair value movements are 
recognised in the Group Income Statement. Amortised cost is calculated by taking into account any issue costs, discount or premium. 
(f) Available-for-sale financial assets 
Available-for-sale financial assets are those non-derivative financial assets that are designated as available-for-sale. They are recognised 
initially at fair value in the Group Balance Sheet. Available-for-sale financial assets are re-measured subsequently at fair value with gains 
and losses arising from changes in fair value recognised directly in equity and presented in the Group Statement of Comprehensive 
Income, until the asset is disposed of or is determined to be impaired, at which time the cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in 
equity is included in the Group Income Statement for the year. Accrued interest or dividends arising on available-for-sale financial assets 
are recognised in the Group Income Statement. 
At each balance sheet date the Group assesses whether there is objective evidence that available-for-sale financial assets are impaired. If 
any such evidence exists, cumulative losses recognised in equity are removed from equity and recognised in the Group Income 
Statement. The cumulative loss removed from equity represents the difference between the acquisition cost and current fair value, less 
any impairment loss on that financial asset previously recognised in the Group Income Statement. 
Impairment losses recognised in the Group Income Statement for equity investments classified as available-for-sale are not subsequently 
reversed through the Group Income Statement. Impairment losses recognised in the Group Income Statement for debt instruments 
classified as available-for-sale are subsequently reversed if an increase in the fair value of the instrument can be objectively related to an 
event occurring after the recognition of the impairment loss. 
(g) Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss 
The Group holds investments in gilts which it designates at fair value through profit or loss. Investments are measured at fair value on initial 
recognition and are re-measured to fair value in each subsequent reporting period. Gains and losses arising from changes in fair value are 
recognised in the Group Income Statement within investment income or financing costs. 
(h) Derivative financial instruments 
The Group routinely enters into sale and purchase transactions for physical delivery of gas, power and oil. A portion of these transactions 
take the form of contracts that were entered into and continue to be held for the purpose of receipt or delivery of the physical commodity 
in accordance with the Group’s expected sale, purchase or usage requirements (‘own use’), and are not within the scope of IAS 39. The 
assessment of whether a contract is deemed to be ‘own use’ is conducted on a Group basis without reference to underlying book 
structures, business units or legal entities.

S2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES  
Certain purchase and sales contracts for the physical delivery of gas, power and oil are within the scope of IAS 39 due to the fact that 
they net settle or contain written options. Such contracts are accounted for as derivatives under IAS 39 and are recognised in the Group 
Balance Sheet at fair value. Gains and losses arising from changes in fair value on derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting are 
taken directly to the Group Income Statement for the year. 
The Group uses a range of derivatives for both trading and to hedge exposures to financial risks, such as interest rates, foreign exchange 
and energy price risks, arising in the normal course of business. The use of derivative financial instruments is governed by the Group’s 
policies which are approved by the Board of Directors. Further detail on the Group’s risk management policies is included within the 
Strategic Report – Principal Risks and Uncertainties on pages 52 to 62 and in note S3. 
The accounting treatment of derivatives is dependent on whether they are entered into for trading or hedging purposes. A derivative 
instrument is considered to be used for hedging purposes when it alters the risk profile of an underlying exposure of the Group in line with 
the Group’s risk management policies and is in accordance with established guidelines. Certain derivative instruments used for hedging 
purposes are designated in hedge accounting relationships as described by IAS 39. In order to qualify for hedge accounting, the 
effectiveness of the hedge must be reliably measurable and documentation describing the formal hedging relationship must be prepared 
at the point of designation. The hedge must be highly effective in achieving its objective. The Group also holds derivatives that are used for 
hedging purposes which are not designated in hedge accounting relationships and are held for trading. 
All derivatives are recognised at fair value on the date on which the derivative is entered into and are re-measured to fair value at each 
reporting date. Derivatives are carried as assets when the fair value is positive and as liabilities when the fair value is negative. Derivative 
assets and derivative liabilities are offset and presented on a net basis only when both a legal right of set-off exists and the intention to net 
settle the derivative contracts is present. 
The Group enters into certain energy derivative contracts covering periods for which observable market data does not exist. The fair value 
of such derivatives is estimated by reference in part to published price quotations from active markets, to the extent that such observable 
market data exists, and in part by using valuation techniques, the inputs to which include data that is not based on or derived from 
observable markets. Where the fair value at initial recognition for such contracts differs from the transaction price, a fair value gain or fair 
value loss will arise. This is referred to as a day-one gain or day-one loss. Such gains and losses are deferred (not recognised) and 
amortised to the Group Income Statement based on volumes purchased or delivered over the contractual period until such time as 
observable market data becomes available. When observable market data becomes available, any remaining deferred day-one gains or 
losses are recognised within the Group Income Statement. Recognition of the gains or losses resulting from changes in fair value depends 
on the purpose for issuing or holding the derivative. For derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting, any gains or losses arising 
from changes in fair value are taken directly to the Group Income Statement and are included within gross profit or investment income and 
financing costs. Gains and losses arising on derivatives entered into for speculative energy trading purposes are presented on a net basis 
within revenue. 
Derivatives embedded in other financial instruments or other host contracts are treated as separate derivatives when their risks and 
characteristics are not closely related to those of the host contracts and the host contracts are not carried at fair value, with gains or 
losses reported in the Group Income Statement. The closely related nature of embedded derivatives is reassessed when there is a change 
in the terms of the contract that significantly modifies the future cash flows under the contract. Where a contract contains one or more 
embedded derivatives, and providing that the embedded derivative significantly modifies the cash flows under the contract, the option to 
fair value the entire contract may be taken and the contract will be recognised at fair value with changes in fair value recognised in the 
Group Income Statement. 
(i) Hedge accounting 
For the purposes of hedge accounting, hedges are classified as either fair value hedges or cash flow hedges. Note S5 details the Group’s 
accounting policies in relation to derivatives qualifying for hedge accounting under IAS 39. 
Nuclear activity 
The Group’s investment in Lake Acquisitions Limited (‘Nuclear’) is accounted for as an associate. The following accounting policies are 
specific to this nuclear activity. 
(a) Fuel costs – nuclear front end 
Front end fuel costs consist of the costs of procurement of uranium, conversion and enrichment services, and fuel element fabrication.  
All costs are capitalised into inventory and charged to the Group Income Statement in proportion to the amount of fuel burnt. 
(b) Fuel costs – nuclear back end 
Advanced gas-cooled reactors (AGR) 
Spent fuel extracted from the reactors is sent for reprocessing and/or long-term storage and eventual disposal of resulting waste 
products. Back end fuel costs comprise of a loading related cost per tonne of uranium and a rebate/surcharge to this cost which is 
dependent on the out-turn market electricity price in the year and are capitalised into inventory and charged to the Group Income 
Statement in proportion to the amount of fuel burnt. 
Pressurised water reactor (PWR) 
Back end fuel costs are based on wet storage in station ponds followed by dry storage and subsequent direct disposal of fuel. Back  
end fuel costs are capitalised into inventory on loading and are charged to the Group Income Statement in proportion to the amount  
of fuel burnt. 
(c) Nuclear property, plant and equipment and depreciation 
The majority of the cost of the nuclear fleet is depreciated from the date of the Group acquiring its share of the fleet on a straight-line 
basis, with remaining depreciable periods currently of up to 18 years. 
Other expenditure including amounts spent on major inspections and overhauls of production plant is depreciated over the period until the 
next outage which for AGR power stations is three years and for the PWR power station is 18 months.

S2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES 
(d) Nuclear Liabilities Fund (NLF) funding arrangements 
Under the arrangements in place with the Secretary of State, the NLF will fund, subject to certain exceptions, qualifying uncontracted 
nuclear liabilities and qualifying decommissioning costs. 
In part consideration for the assumption of these liabilities by the Secretary of State and the NLF, the former British Energy Group agreed 
to pay fixed decommissioning contributions each year and £150,000 (indexed to RPI) for every tonne of uranium in PWR fuel loaded into 
the Sizewell B reactor after the date of these arrangements. 
(e) NLF and nuclear liabilities receivables 
The UK Government indemnity is provided to indemnify any future shortfall on NLF funding of qualifying uncontracted nuclear liabilities 
(including PWR back end fuel services) and qualifying nuclear decommissioning costs such that the receivable equals the present value of 
the associated qualifying nuclear liabilities (apart from a small timing difference due to timing of receipts from NLF). 
(f) Nuclear liabilities 
Nuclear liabilities represent provision for liabilities in respect of the costs of waste management of spent fuel and nuclear decommissioning. 
(g) Unburnt fuels at shutdown 
Due to the nature of the nuclear fuel process there will be quantities of unburnt fuel in the reactors at station closure. The costs relating to 
this unburnt fuel (final core) are fully provided for at the balance sheet date. The provision is based on a projected value per tonne of fuel 
remaining at closure, discounted back to the balance sheet date and recorded as a long-term liability. 
S3. FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT 
The Group’s normal operating, investing and financing activities expose it to a variety of financial risks: market risk (including 
commodity price risk, currency risk and interest rate risk), credit risk and liquidity risk. The Group’s overall financial risk 
management processes are designed to identify, manage and mitigate these risks. 
Further detail on the Group’s overall risk management processes is included within the Strategic Report – Principal Risks and 
Uncertainties on pages 52 to 62. 
Commodity price risk management is carried out in accordance with individual business unit policies and directives including appropriate 
escalation routes.  
Treasury risk management, including management of currency risk, interest rate risk and liquidity risk is carried out by a central Group 
Treasury function in accordance with the Group’s financing and treasury policy, as approved by the Board. 
The wholesale credit risks associated with commodity trading and treasury positions are managed in accordance with the Group’s credit risk 
policy. Downstream customer credit risk management is carried out in accordance with individual business unit credit policies. 
Market risk management 
Market risk is the risk of loss that results from changes in market prices (commodity prices, foreign exchange rates and interest rates). The level of 
market risk to which the Group is exposed at a point in time varies depending on market conditions, expectations of future price or market rate 
movements and the composition of the Group’s physical asset and contract portfolios. 
(a) Commodity price risk management 
The Group is exposed to commodity price risk in its energy procurement and supply activities, production, generation and trading operations and 
uses specific limits to manage the exposure to commodity prices associated with the Group’s activities to an acceptable level. The Group uses 
Profit at Risk (PaR) limits to control exposures to market prices. These are complemented by other limits including Value at Risk (VaR), volumetric 
or stop-loss limits to control risk around trading activities. 
(i) Energy price exposed business activities 
The Group’s price exposed business activities consist of equity gas and liquids production, equity power generation, bilateral procurement and 
sales contracts, market-traded purchase and sales contracts and derivative positions primarily transacted with the intent of securing gas and 
power for the Group’s supply customers, from a variety of sources at an optimal cost. The Group actively manages commodity price risk by 
optimising its asset and contract portfolios and making use of volume flexibility. 
The Group’s commodity price risk exposure in its business activities is driven by the cost of procuring gas and electricity to serve its supply 
customers and selling gas, oil and electricity from its upstream production and generation, which varies with wholesale commodity prices. The 
primary risk is that market prices for commodities will fluctuate between the time that sales prices are fixed or tariffs are set and the time at which 
the corresponding procurement cost is fixed, thereby potentially reducing expected margins or making sales unprofitable. 
The Group’s supply activities are also exposed to volumetric risk in the form of an uncertain consumption profile arising from a range of factors, 
including the weather, energy consumption changes, customer attrition and the economic climate. There is also risk associated with ensuring that 
there is sufficient commodity available to secure supply to customers. The Group’s production and generation activities are also exposed to 
volumetric risk in the form of uncertain production profiles. 
In order to manage the exposure to market prices associated with the Group’s business operations the Group uses a specific set of limits 
(including VaR and PaR) established by the Board, and sub-delegated downwards through the delegation lines to the commercial leaders.  
PaR measures the estimated potential loss in a position or portfolio of positions associated with the movement of a commodity price for a given 
confidence level, over the remaining term of the position or contract. VaR measures the estimated potential loss for a given confidence level over a 
predetermined holding period. The standard confidence level used is 95%. In addition, regular stress and scenario tests are performed to evaluate 
the impact on the portfolio of possible substantial movements in commodity prices. 
The Group measures and manages the commodity price risk associated with the Group’s entire energy price exposed business portfolio. Only 
certain of the Group’s energy contracts constitute financial instruments under IAS 39 (note S6).

S3. FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT 
As a result, while the Group manages the commodity price risk associated with both financial and non-financial energy procurement, sales and 
purchase contracts, it is the notional value of energy contracts being carried at fair value that represents the exposure of the Group’s energy price 
exposed business activities to commodity price risk according to IFRS 7: ‘Financial instruments: disclosures’. This is because energy contracts 
that are financial instruments under IAS 39 are accounted for on a fair value basis and changes in fair value immediately impact profit. Conversely, 
energy contracts that are not financial instruments under IAS 39 are accounted for as executory contracts and changes in fair value do not 
immediately impact profit, and as such, are not exposed to commodity price risk as defined by IFRS 7. So whilst the PaR or VaR associated with 
energy procurement and supply contracts that are outside the scope of IAS 39 are monitored for internal risk management purposes; only those 
energy contracts within the scope of IAS 39 are within the scope of the IFRS 7 disclosure requirements. 
(ii) Proprietary energy trading 
The Group’s proprietary energy trading activities consist of physical and financial commodity purchases and sales contracts taken on with 
the intent of benefiting from changes in market prices or differences between buying and selling prices. The Group conducts its trading 
activities in the over-the-counter market and through exchanges in the UK, North America and continental Europe. The Group is exposed 
to commodity price risk as a result of its proprietary energy trading activities because the value of its trading assets and liabilities will 
fluctuate with changes in market prices for commodities. 
The Group sets volumetric and VaR limits to manage the commodity price risk exposure associated with the Group’s proprietary energy 
trading activities. VaR measures the estimated potential loss at a 95% confidence level over a one-day holding period. The carrying value 
of energy contracts used in proprietary energy trading activities at 31 December 2017 is disclosed in note 19. 
As with any modelled risk measure, there are certain limitations that arise from the assumptions used in the VaR calculation. VaR assumes 
that historical price behaviours will continue in the future and that the Group’s trading positions can be unwound or hedged within the 
predetermined holding period. Furthermore, the use of a 95% confidence level, by definition, does not take into account changes in value 
that might occur beyond this confidence level. 
(b) Currency risk management 
The Group is exposed to currency risk on foreign currency denominated forecast transactions, firm commitments, monetary assets and 
liabilities (transactional exposure) and on its net investments in foreign operations (translational exposure). IFRS 7 only requires disclosure 
of currency risk arising on financial instruments denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the commercial operation 
transacting. As a result, for the purposes of IFRS 7, currency risk excludes items that are not financial instruments, such as the Group’s 
net investments in international operations as well as foreign currency denominated forecast transactions and firm commitments. 
(i) Transactional currency risk 
The Group is exposed to transactional currency risk on transactions denominated in currencies other than the underlying functional 
currency of the commercial operation transacting. The Group has been increasing its international presence through acquisition and the 
primary functional currencies remain pounds sterling in the UK, Canadian dollars in Canada, US dollars in the US, Norwegian krone in 
Norway, Danish krone in Denmark and euros in the Netherlands and the Republic of Ireland. The risk is that the functional currency value 
of cash flows will vary as a result of movements in exchange rates. Transactional exposure arises from the Group’s energy procurement, 
production and generation activities, where many transactions are denominated in foreign currencies. In addition, in order to optimise the 
cost of funding, the Group has, in certain cases, issued foreign currency denominated debt or entered into foreign currency loans, 
primarily in US dollars, euros, Japanese yen and Hong Kong dollars. 
It is the Group’s policy to hedge material transactional exposures using derivatives to fix the functional currency value of non-functional 
currency cash flows, except where there is an economic hedge inherent in the transaction. At 31 December 2017, there were no material 
unhedged non-functional currency monetary assets or liabilities, firm commitments or probable forecast transactions (2016: nil), other than 
transactions which have an inherent economic hedge and foreign currency borrowings used to hedge translational exposures. 
(ii) Translational currency risk 
The Group is exposed to translational currency risk as a result of its net investments in North America and Europe. The risk is that the 
pound sterling value of the net assets of foreign operations will decrease with changes in foreign exchange rates. The Group’s policy is to 
protect the pounds sterling book value of its net investments in foreign operations where appropriate, subject to certain parameters, by 
holding foreign currency debt, entering into foreign currency derivatives, or a mixture of both. 
The Group manages translational currency risk taking into consideration the cash impact of any hedging activity as well as the risk to the 
net asset numbers in the Group’s Financial Statements. The translation hedging programme including the potential cash impact is 
managed by the Group Treasury function and monitored by the Chief Financial Officer. 
(c) Interest rate risk management 
In the normal course of business the Group borrows to finance its operations. The Group is exposed to interest rate risk because the fair 
value of fixed rate borrowings and the cash flows associated with floating rate borrowings will fluctuate with changes in interest rates. The 
Group’s policy is to manage the interest rate risk on long-term borrowings by ensuring the exposure to floating interest rates remains 
within a 30% to 70% range, including the impact of interest rate derivatives. 
The return generated on the Group’s cash balance is also exposed to movements in short-term interest rates. The Group manages cash 
balances to protect against adverse changes in rates whilst retaining liquidity. 
(d) Sensitivity analysis 
IFRS 7 requires disclosure of a sensitivity analysis that is intended to illustrate the sensitivity of the Group’s financial position and performance 
to changes in market variables (commodity prices, foreign exchange rates and interest rates) as a result of changes in the fair value or cash 
flows associated with the Group’s financial instruments. The sensitivity analysis provided discloses the effect on profit or loss and equity at 
31 December 2017, assuming that a reasonably possible change in the relevant risk variable had occurred at 31 December 2017, and 
has been applied to the risk exposures in existence at that date to show the effects of reasonably possible changes in price on profit or 
loss and equity. Reasonably possible changes in market variables used in the sensitivity analysis are based on implied volatilities, where 
available, or historical data for energy prices and foreign exchange rates. Reasonably possible changes in interest rates are based on 
management judgement and historical experience. 
Centrica Financials_Back-End.indd   170 16/03/2018   15:49 Centrica plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 | 171
 
 
Centrica plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 | 171 
S3. FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT  
The sensitivity analysis has been prepared based on 31 December 2017 balances and on the basis that the balances, the ratio of fixed  
to floating rates of debt and derivatives, the proportion of energy contracts that are financial instruments, the proportion of financial 
instruments in foreign currencies and the hedge designations in place at 31 December 2017 are all constant. Excluded from this analysis 
are all non-financial assets and liabilities and energy contracts that are not financial instruments under IAS 39. The sensitivity to foreign 
exchange rates relates only to monetary assets and liabilities denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the 
commercial operation transacting, and excludes the translation of the net assets of foreign operations to pounds sterling. 
The sensitivity analysis provided is hypothetical only and should be used with caution as the impacts provided are not necessarily 
indicative of the actual impacts that would be experienced. This is because the Group’s actual exposure to market rates is changing 
constantly as the Group’s portfolio of commodity, debt and foreign currency contracts changes. Changes in fair values or cash flows 
based on a variation in a market variable cannot be extrapolated because the relationship between the change in market variable and the 
change in fair value or cash flows may not be linear. In addition, the effect of a change in a particular market variable on fair values or cash 
flows is calculated without considering interrelationships between the various market rates or mitigating actions that would be taken by the 
Group. The sensitivity analysis provided excludes the impact of proprietary energy trading assets and liabilities because the VaR 
associated with the Group’s proprietary energy trading activities is less than £5 million. 
(i) Transactional currency risk 
The Group has performed an analysis of the sensitivity of the Group’s financial position and performance to changes in foreign exchange 
rates. The Group deems 10% movements to US dollar, Canadian dollar and euro currency rates relative to pounds sterling to be reasonably 
possible. The impact of such movements on profit and equity, both before and after taxation, is immaterial.  
(ii) Interest rate risk 
The Group has performed an analysis of the sensitivity of the Group’s financial position and performance to changes in interest rates. The 
Group deems a one percentage point move in UK, US and euro interest rates to be reasonably possible. The impact of such movements 
on profit and equity, both after taxation, is immaterial. 
(iii) Commodity price risk 
The impacts of reasonably possible changes in commodity prices on profit and equity, both after taxation, based on the assumptions set 
out above are as follows:

Credit risk management 
Credit risk is the risk of loss associated with a counterparty’s inability or failure to discharge its obligations under a contract. The Group 
continually reviews its rating thresholds for counterparty credit limits and updates these as necessary, based on a consistent set of 
principles. It continues to operate within its limits. In both the US and Europe, there is an effort to maintain a balance between exchange 
based trading and bilateral transactions. This allows for a reasonable balance between counterparty credit risk and potential liquidity 
requirements. In addition the Group actively manages the trade-off between credit and liquidity risks by optimising the use of contracts 
with collateral obligations and physically settled contracts without collateral obligations.

(i) The unrated counterparty receivables primarily comprise amounts due from subsidiaries of rated entities, exchanges or clearing houses. 
Details of how credit risk is managed across the asset categories are provided below: 
(a) Treasury, trading and energy procurement activities 
Wholesale counterparty credit exposures are monitored by individual counterparty and by category of credit rating, and are subject to 
approved limits. The Group uses master netting agreements to reduce credit risk and net settles payments with counterparties where net 
settlement provisions exist (see note S6 for details of amounts offset). In addition, the Group employs a variety of other methods to 
mitigate credit risk: margining, various forms of bank and parent company guarantees and letters of credit. See note 24(c) for details of 
cash posted or received under margin or collateral agreements. 
100% of the Group’s credit risk associated with its treasury, trading and energy procurement activities is with counterparties in related 
energy industries or with financial institutions.  
IFRS 7 requires disclosure of information about the exposure to credit risk arising from financial instruments only. Only certain of the 
Group’s energy procurement contracts constitute financial instruments under IAS 39. As a result, whilst the Group manages the credit risk 
associated with both financial and non-financial energy procurement contracts, it is the carrying value of financial assets within the scope 
of IAS 39 (note S6) that represents the maximum exposure to credit risk in accordance with IFRS 7. 
(b) Downstream activities 
In the case of business customers, credit risk is managed by checking a company’s creditworthiness and financial strength both before 
commencing trade and during the business relationship. For residential customers, creditworthiness is ascertained normally before 
commencing trade to determine the payment mechanism required to reduce credit risk to an acceptable level. Certain customers will only 
be accepted on a prepayment basis or with a security deposit. In some cases, an ageing of receivables is monitored and used to manage 
the exposure to credit risk associated with both business and residential customers. In other cases, credit risk is monitored and managed 
by grouping customers according to method of payment or profile. 
Liquidity risk management and going concern 
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group is unable to meet its financial obligations as they fall due. The Group experiences significant 
movements in its liquidity position due primarily to the seasonal nature of its business and margin cash arrangements associated with 
certain wholesale commodity contracts. To mitigate this risk the Group maintains significant committed facilities and holds cash on 
deposit. See note 24(b) for further information.

Merger, capital redemption and other reserves 
During February 1997, BG plc (formerly British Gas plc) demerged certain businesses (grouped together under GB Gas Holdings Limited 
(GBGH)) to form Centrica plc. Upon demerger, the share capital of GBGH was transferred to Centrica plc and was recorded at the 
nominal value of shares issued to BG plc shareholders. In accordance with the Companies Act 1985, no premium was recorded on the 
shares issued. On consolidation, the difference between the nominal value of the Company’s shares issued and the amount of share 
capital and share premium of GBGH at the date of demerger was credited to a merger reserve. 
On 8 December 2017, the Group’s existing Exploration & Production business was combined with that of Bayerngas Norge AS to form 
the Spirit Energy business. The Group acquired 69% of the Spirit Energy business and Bayerngas Norge’s former shareholders acquired 
31%. The non-controlling interest established on acquisition has been based on its share of the carrying value of the combined business, 
with the other reserve representing the difference between the fair value and this carrying value. See note 12(a).

Centrica plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 | 175 
S4. OTHER EQUITY 
In accordance with the Companies Act 1985, the Company has transferred to the capital redemption reserve an amount equal to the 
nominal value of shares repurchased and subsequently cancelled. Up to 31 December 2017 the cumulative nominal value of shares 
repurchased and subsequently cancelled was £26 million (2016: £26 million). 
Own shares reserve 
The own shares reserve reflects the cost of shares in the Company held in the Centrica employee share ownership trusts to meet the 
future requirements of the Group’s share-based payment plans. 
Treasury shares reserve 
Treasury shares are acquired equity instruments of the Company.  
Share-based payments reserve 
The share-based payments reserve reflects the obligation to deliver shares to employees under the Group’s share schemes in return for 
services provided. 
Foreign currency translation reserve 
The foreign currency translation reserve comprises exchange adjustments on the translation of the Group’s foreign operations. Historically 
the Group has hedged its net investments in these foreign operations and the opening balance of the foreign currency translation reserve 
includes exchange translation adjustments on borrowings and derivatives classified as net investment hedges under the requirements of 
IAS 39. Note S5 provides further detail on historical net investment hedges. 
Cash flow hedging reserve 
The cash flow hedging reserve comprises fair value movements on instruments designated as cash flow hedges under the requirements 
of IAS 39. Amounts are transferred from the cash flow hedging reserve to the Group Income Statement or Group Balance Sheet as and 
when the hedged item affects the Group Income Statement or Group Balance Sheet which is, for the most part, on receipt or payment  
of amounts denominated in foreign currencies and settlement of interest on debt instruments. Note S5 provides further detail on cash  
flow hedging. 
S5. HEDGE ACCOUNTING 
For the purposes of hedge accounting, hedges are classified either as fair value hedges, cash flow hedges or, in previous periods, 
hedges of net investments in foreign operations.  
The fair values of derivatives and primary financial instruments in hedge accounting relationships at 31 December were as follows:  
31 December 
Assets
£m

2016
Liabilities
£m 
Fair value hedges  128 (6) 158 (5)
Cash flow hedges 162 (16) 151 (3)
The Group’s accounting policies in relation to derivatives qualifying for hedge accounting under IAS 39 are described below. 
Fair value hedges  
A derivative is designated as a hedging instrument and its relationship to a recognised asset or liability is classified as a fair value hedge 
when it hedges the exposure to changes in the fair value of that recognised asset or liability. The Group’s fair value hedges consist of 
interest rate swaps used to protect against changes in the fair value of fixed-rate, long-term debt due to movements in market interest 
rates. Any gain or loss from re-measuring the hedging instrument to fair value is recognised immediately in the Group Income Statement. 
Any gain or loss on the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk is adjusted against the carrying amount of the hedged item and 
recognised in the Group Income Statement within net finance cost. The Group discontinues fair value hedge accounting if the hedging 
instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised, the hedge no longer qualifies for hedge accounting or the Group revokes the 
designation. Any adjustment to the carrying amount of a hedged financial instrument for which the effective interest method is used is 
amortised to the Group Income Statement. Amortisation may begin as soon as an adjustment exists and shall begin no later than when 
the hedged item ceases to be adjusted for changes in its fair value attributable to the risk being hedged. 
Gains or losses arising on fair value hedges net of gains or losses arising on hedged items attributable to the hedged risk for the years 
ended 31 December 2017 and 31 December 2016 were immaterial. 
Cash flow hedges  
A derivative is classified as a cash flow hedge when it hedges exposure to variability in cash flows that is attributable to a particular risk 
either associated with a recognised asset, liability or a highly probable forecast transaction. The Group’s cash flow hedges consist 
primarily of:  
● forward foreign exchange contracts used to protect against the variability of functional currency denominated cash flows associated 
with non-functional currency denominated highly probable forecast transactions; and 
● cross-currency interest rate swaps and forward foreign exchange contracts used to protect against the variability in cash flows 
associated with borrowings denominated in non-functional currencies.

S5. HEDGE ACCOUNTING 
The portion of the gain or loss on the hedging instrument which is effective is recognised directly in equity while any ineffectiveness is 
recognised in the Group Income Statement. The gains or losses that are initially recognised in the cash flow hedging reserve in the Group 
Statement of Comprehensive Income are transferred to the Group Income Statement in the same period in which the highly probable 
forecast transaction affects income. Where the hedged item is the cost of a non-financial asset or liability, the amounts taken to equity are 
transferred to the initial carrying amount of the non-financial asset or liability on its recognition. Hedge accounting is discontinued when the 
hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised without replacement or rollover, no longer qualifies for hedge accounting or 
the Group revokes the designation. At that point in time, any cumulative gain or loss on the hedging instrument recognised in equity 
remains in equity until the highly probable forecast transaction occurs. If the transaction is no longer expected to occur, the cumulative 
gain or loss recognised in equity is recognised in the Group Income Statement. 
Note S4 details movements in the cash flow hedging reserve. The ineffective portion of gains and losses on cash flow hedging is 
immaterial and is recognised immediately in the Group Income Statement.  
Net investment hedges  
Historically the Group engaged in net investment hedging (NIH) whereby it would obtain foreign currency debt issued in the same currency 
as its net investment in a foreign operation. Such hedges of net investments in foreign operations are accounted for similarly to cash flow 
hedges. Any gain or loss on the effective portion of the hedge is recognised in equity; any gain or loss on the ineffective portion of the 
hedge is recognised in the Group Income Statement. In 2009 the Group ceased to NIH, however the opening balance of the foreign 
currency translation reserve includes cumulative exchange translation adjustments on borrowings and derivatives classified as a NIH under 
the requirements of IAS 39. These balances will be recycled to the Group Income Statement on disposal of the relevant foreign operation. 
S6. FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS 
The fair value of a financial instrument is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly 
transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The Group has documented internal policies for determining 
fair value, including methodologies used to establish valuation adjustments required for credit risk. 
(a) Fair value hierarchy 
Financial assets and financial liabilities measured and held at fair value are classified into one of three categories, known as hierarchy 
levels, which are defined according to the inputs used to measure fair value as follows: 
● Level 1: fair value is determined using observable inputs that reflect unadjusted quoted market prices for identical assets and liabilities; 
● Level 2: fair value is determined using significant inputs that may be directly observable inputs or unobservable inputs that are 
corroborated by market data; and 
● Level 3: fair value is determined using significant unobservable inputs that are not corroborated by market data and may be used with 
internally developed methodologies that result in management’s best estimate of fair value.

(ii) Transfers between levels are deemed to occur at the beginning of the reporting period. 
(iii) £19 million gains (2016: £89 million gains) for the year for Level 3 financial assets held at the end of the reporting year were recognised within certain re-measurements and no gains or losses 
(2016: nil) were recognised in other comprehensive income. £15 million losses (2016: £4 million losses) for the year for Level 3 financial liabilities held at the end of the reporting year were 
recognised within exceptional items and certain re-measurements and no gains or losses (2016: nil) were recognised in other comprehensive income. 
(b) Valuation techniques used to derive Level 2 and Level 3 fair values and Group valuation process  
Level 2 interest rate derivatives and foreign exchange derivatives comprise interest rate swaps and forward foreign exchange contracts. 
Interest rate swaps are fair valued using forward interest rates extracted from observable yield curves. Forward foreign exchange 
contracts are fair valued using forward exchange rates that are quoted in an active market, with the resulting market value discounted 
back to present value using observable yield curves. 
Level 2 energy derivatives are fair valued by comparing and discounting the difference between the expected contractual cash flows for 
the relevant commodities and the quoted prices for those commodities in an active market. The average discount rate applied to value  
this type of contract during 2017 was 1% (2016: 1%) (Europe) and 3% (2016: 3%) (North America) per annum. 
For Level 3 energy derivatives, the main input used by the Group pertains to deriving expected future commodity prices in markets that 
are not active as far into the future as some of our contractual terms. This applies to certain contracts within the UK and US. Fair values 
are then calculated by comparing and discounting the difference between the expected contractual cash flows and these derived future 
prices using an average discount rate of 1% (2016: 1%) (UK) and 3% (2016: 7%) (US) per annum for 2017. 
Active period of markets 
Gas Power Coal Emissions Oil 
UK (years)  3 3 3 3 3
North America (years) 5 Up to 5 N/A Up to 5 3
Because the Level 3 energy derivative valuations involve the prediction of future commodity market prices, sometimes a long way into the 
future, reasonably possible alternative assumptions for gas, power, coal, emissions or oil prices may result in a higher or lower fair value 
for Level 3 financial instruments. Given the relative size of these fair values, it is unlikely that the impact of these reasonably possible 
changes would be significant when judged in relation to the Group’s profit and loss or total asset value. 
It should be noted that the fair values disclosed in the tables above only concern those contracts entered into which are within the scope 
of IAS 39. The Group has numerous other commodity contracts which are outside of the scope of IAS 39 and are not fair valued. The 
Group’s actual exposure to market rates is constantly changing as the Group’s portfolio of energy contracts changes.  
The Group’s valuation process includes specific teams of individuals that perform valuations of the Group’s derivatives for financial 
reporting purposes, including Level 3 valuations. The Group has an independent team that derives future commodity price curves based 
on available external data and these prices feed in to the energy derivative valuations, subject to adjustments to ensure they are compliant 
with IFRS 13: ‘Fair value measurement’. The price curves are subject to review and approval by the Group’s Executive Committee and 
valuations of all derivatives, together with other contracts that are not within the scope of IAS 39, are also reviewed regularly as part of the 
overall risk management process. 
Where the fair value at initial recognition for contracts which extend beyond the active period differs from the transaction price, a day-one 
gain or loss will arise. Such gains and losses are deferred and amortised to the Group Income Statement based on volumes purchased or 
delivered over the contractual period until such time as observable market data becomes available (see note S2 for further detail). The 
amount that has yet to be recognised in the Group Income Statement relating to the differences between the transaction prices and the 
amounts that would have arisen had valuation techniques used for subsequent measurement been applied at initial recognition, less

S6. FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS 
(c) Fair value of financial assets and liabilities held at amortised cost  
The carrying value of the Group’s financial assets and liabilities measured at amortised cost are approximately equal to their fair value 
except as listed below:

Financial liabilities 
The fair values of bonds classified as Level 1 within the fair value hierarchy are calculated using quoted market prices. The fair values of 
Level 2 bonds and bank loans have been determined by discounting cash flows with reference to relevant market rates of interest. The fair 
values of overdrafts, short-term loans and commercial paper are assumed to equal their book values due to the short-term nature of these 
amounts. The fair values of obligations under finance leases have been determined by discounting contractual cash flows with reference 
to the Group’s cost of borrowing. 
Other financial instruments 
Due to their nature and/or short-term maturity, the fair values of trade and other receivables, cash and cash equivalents, trade and other 
payables and provisions are estimated to approximate their carrying values.

(i) The Group has arrangements in place with various counterparties in respect of commodity trades which provide for a single net settlement of all financial instruments covered by the 
arrangement in the event of default or termination, or other circumstances arising whereby either party is unable to meet its obligations. The above table shows the potential impact of these 
arrangements being enforced by offsetting the relevant amounts within each Group Balance Sheet class of asset or liability, but does not show the impact of offsetting across Group Balance 
Sheet classes.

S7. FIXED-FEE SERVICE AND INSURANCE CONTRACTS 
This section includes fixed-fee service (FFS) and insurance contract disclosures for services related to UK Home and North 
America Home. 
FFS contracts in North America are entered into with home and business services customers. Insurance contracts in North America are 
entered into with home services customers. 
FFS contracts in the UK are entered into with home services customers by British Gas Services Limited (BGSL). Insurance contracts in  
the UK are entered into with home services customers by British Gas Insurance Limited (BGIL), authorised by the PRA and regulated by 
the FCA and the PRA.  
Product offerings include central heating, boiler and controls, plumbing and drains and electrical appliance insurance cover.  
FFS contracts continue until cancelled by either party; insurance contracts normally provide cover for 12 months with the option 
of renewal. 
The contracts which protect policyholders against the risk of breakdowns result in the transfer of risk to the contract provider. Benefits 
provided to customers vary in accordance with terms and conditions of the contracts entered into. However, they generally include 
maintenance, repair and/or replacement of the items affected. 
The levels of risk exposure and service provision to customers under the contract terms are dependent on the occurrence of uncertain 
future events, in particular the nature and frequency of faults and the cost of repair or replacement of the items affected. Accordingly, the 
timing and amount of future cash outflows associated with the contracts is uncertain. The key terms and conditions that affect future cash 
flows are as follows: 
● provision of labour and parts for repairs, dependent on the agreement and associated level of service; 
● a specified number of safety and maintenance inspections are carried out as set out in the agreement (usually once a year); 
● no limit to the number of call-outs to carry out repair work; and  
● limits on certain maintenance and repair costs.  
Revenue is recognised over the life of contracts having regard to the incidence of risk, in particular the seasonal propensity of claims 
which span the life of the contract as a result of emergency maintenance being available throughout the contract term. Costs incurred to 
settle claims represent principally the engineer workforce employed by the Group within home services and the cost of parts utilised in 
repair or maintenance. These costs are accounted for over a 12-month period with adjustments made to reflect the seasonality of 
workload over a given year. 
Weather conditions and the seasonality of repairs both affect the profile of the workload and associated costs incurred across the year. 
The risk exposure of these uncertain events is actively managed by undertaking the following risk mitigation activities: 
● an initial service visit is provided to customers taking up most central heating contracts and in some instances pre-existing faults may 
lead to the contract being cancelled and no further cover being provided; 
● an annual maintenance inspection is performed as part of most central heating contracts to help identify and prevent issues developing 
into significant maintenance or breakdown claims; and 
● contract limits are applied to certain types of maintenance and repair work considered to be higher risk in terms of frequency and cost. 
The costs of FFS claims and insurance claims incurred during the year were £44 million (2016: £48 million) and £389 million (2016: £391 
million) respectively and are included in the table below in ‘Expenses relating to FFS and insurance contracts’. All claims are settled 
immediately and in full. Due to the short average lead time between claims occurrence and settlement, no material provisions were 
outstanding at the balance sheet date (2016: nil).

Total revenue 974 1,177

The Group considers whether estimated future cash flows under the contracts will be sufficient to meet expected future costs. Any deficiency  
is charged immediately to the Group Income Statement. Claims frequency is sensitive to the reliability of appliances as well as the impact  
of weather conditions. The contracts are not exposed to any interest rate risk or significant credit risk and do not contain any  
embedded derivatives.

S9. AUDITORS’ REMUNERATION 
During 2017, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP (‘PwC’) ceased to hold office as auditor and following a rigorous and competitive tender 
process, Deloitte LLP were appointed auditors of the Group. Deloitte had been engaged to perform certain activities for the Group prior to 
their appointment as auditors, and before this the Group undertook a thorough review of all pre-existing arrangements. As a result of this, 
certain arrangements were terminated during 2016 and whilst others were permissible under all relevant regulatory requirements, the 
decision was taken to wind them down during the first half of 2017. The majority of fees noted in the caption ‘All other services’ above, 
relate to such transitional arrangements, which have now ceased.  
It is the Group’s policy to seek competitive tenders for all major consultancy and advisory projects. Appointments are made taking into 
account factors including expertise, experience and cost. In addition, the Audit Committee has approved a detailed policy defining the 
types of work for which the Company’s auditors can tender and the approvals required. In the past, the Company’s auditors have been 
engaged on assignments in addition to their statutory audit duties where their expertise and experience with the Group are particularly 
important, including due diligence reporting and corporate finance support for acquisitions and disposals.

● prior year reconciliations for property, plant and equipment and intangible assets; 
● the prior year reconciliation in the number of shares outstanding at the beginning and at the end of the year for share capital;

As the consolidated Financial Statements of Centrica plc, which are available from the registered office, include the equivalent disclosures, 
the Company has also taken the exemptions under FRS 101 available in respect of the following disclosures: 
● IFRS 2: ‘Share-based payment’ in respect of Group settled share-based payments; and 
● certain disclosures required by IFRS 13: ‘Fair value measurement’ and the disclosures required by IFRS 7: ‘Financial instruments: 
disclosures’ have not been provided apart from those which are relevant for the financial instruments which are held at fair value. 
Measurement convention 
The Company Financial Statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis except for: investments in subsidiaries that have been 
recognised at deemed cost on transition to FRS 101; derivative financial instruments, available-for-sale financial assets, financial 
instruments designated at fair value through profit or loss on initial recognition, and the assets of the defined benefit pension schemes that 
have been measured at fair value; the liabilities of the defined benefit pension schemes that have been measured using the projected unit 
credit valuation method; and the carrying values of recognised assets and liabilities qualifying as hedged items in fair value hedges that 
have been adjusted from cost by the changes in the fair values attributable to the risks that are being hedged. 
Going concern 
The accounts have been prepared on a going concern basis, as described in the Directors’ Report and note 24(b) of the consolidated 
Group Financial Statements. 
Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty 
The critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty are set out in note 3 of the consolidated Group  
Financial Statements.  
The key accounting judgement of the Company is the carrying value of its investments in subsidiary undertakings and receivables from 
these undertakings. The Company does not deem its investments in subsidiary undertakings to be impaired and supports this judgement 
through its impairment review process as detailed below. This impairment review process identified that some receivables from Group 
undertakings were not fully recoverable and accordingly an increase in the bad debt provision of £17 million (2016: £87 million)  
was recognised against receivables during the year and impairments of £709 million (2016: £404 million) made in previous years  
were reversed. 
Key sources of estimation uncertainty include the allocation of the Company’s share of pension scheme surplus/deficit, as detailed further 
within the accounting policies section of these Company Financial Statements, and also in note XVI.

I. GENERAL INFORMATION AND PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES OF THE COMPANY 
Principal accounting policies 
The accounting policies set out below have, unless otherwise stated, been applied consistently to all periods presented in these Company 
Financial Statements.  
Employee share schemes 
The Group has a number of employee share schemes under which it makes equity-settled share-based payments as detailed in the 
Remuneration Report on pages 78 to 89 and in note S2 to the consolidated Group Financial Statements. Equity-settled share-based 
payments are measured at fair value at the date of grant (excluding the effect of non-market-based vesting conditions). The fair value 
determined at the grant date is expensed on a straight-line basis together with a corresponding increase in equity over the vesting period, 
based on the Group’s estimate of the number of awards that will vest and adjusted for the effect of non-market-based vesting conditions. 
The issue of share incentives by the Company to employees of its subsidiaries represents additional capital contributions. When these 
costs are recharged to the subsidiary undertaking, the investment balance is reduced accordingly.  
Fair value is measured using methods detailed in note S2 to the consolidated Group Financial Statements. 
Foreign currencies 
The Company’s functional and presentational currency is pounds sterling. Transactions in foreign currencies are translated at the rate of 
exchange ruling at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated into pounds 
sterling at closing rates of exchange. Exchange differences on monetary assets and liabilities are taken to the Income Statement. 
Property, plant and equipment  
PP&E is included in the Balance Sheet at cost, less accumulated depreciation and any provisions for impairment. The initial cost of an 
asset comprises purchase price and construction cost and any costs directly attributable to bringing the asset into operation. The 
purchase price or construction cost is the aggregate amount paid and the fair value of any other consideration given to acquire the asset. 
Depreciation is charged so as to write off the cost of assets over their estimated useful lives, on a straight-line basis, over a period of  
3 to 10 years. 
Intangible assets 
Intangible assets acquired separately are measured on initial recognition at cost. Intangible assets consist of application software for 
internal use. The cost of purchased application software, for example investments in financial and administrative systems, includes 
contractors’ charges, materials, directly attributable labour and directly attributable overheads. Intangible assets are amortised on a 
straight-line basis at rates sufficient to write off the cost, less estimated residual values, of individual assets over their estimated useful lives 
of up to 10 years. Amortisation of assets under construction commences when the asset is operational. 
Investments 
Fixed asset investments in subsidiaries’ shares are held at deemed cost on transition to FRS 101 and at cost in accordance with IAS 27: 
‘Separate financial statements’, less any provision for impairment as necessary for any subsequent investments. 
Impairment 
The Company’s accounting policies in respect of impairment of property, plant and equipment, intangible assets and financial assets are 
consistent with those of the Group. 
The carrying values of investments in subsidiary undertakings are reviewed at each reporting date to determine whether there is any 
indication of impairment. If any such indication exists, then the asset’s recoverable amount is estimated. 
The recoverable amount of an investment in a subsidiary undertaking is the greater of its value in use and its fair value less costs of disposal. 
In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects 
current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset. Receivables from Group undertakings are 
compared to their recoverable amount, which is also assessed using the same estimated discounted future cash flow for each 
undertaking as described above. 
An impairment loss is recognised if the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated recoverable amount. 
Leases 
The determination of whether an arrangement is, or contains, a lease is based on the substance of the arrangement and requires an 
assessment of whether the fulfilment of the arrangement is dependent on the use of a specific asset or assets and whether the 
arrangement conveys a right to use the asset or assets. Leases are classified as finance leases whenever the terms of the lease transfer 
substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership to the lessee. All other leases are classified as operating leases. 
Payments under operating leases are charged to the Income Statement on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.

I. GENERAL INFORMATION AND PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES OF THE COMPANY 
Pensions and other post-employment benefits 
The Company’s employees participate in a number of the Group’s defined benefit pension schemes. The total Group cost of providing 
benefits under defined benefit schemes is determined separately for each of the Group’s schemes under the projected unit credit actuarial 
valuation method. Actuarial gains and losses are recognised in full in the period in which they occur. The key assumptions used for the 
actuarial valuation are based on the Group’s best estimate of the variables that will determine the ultimate cost of providing post-
employment benefits, on which further detail is provided in note 22 to the consolidated Group Financial Statements. 
The Company’s share of the total Group surplus or deficit at the end of the reporting period for each scheme is calculated in proportion  
to the Company’s share of ordinary employer contributions to that scheme during the year; ordinary employer contributions are 
determined by the pensionable pay of the Company’s employees within the scheme and the cash contribution rates set by the scheme 
trustees. Current service cost is calculated with reference to the pensionable pay of the Company’s employees. The Company’s share of 
the total Group interest on scheme liabilities, expected return on scheme assets and actuarial gains or losses is calculated in proportion to 
ordinary employer contributions in the prior accounting period. Changes in the surplus or deficit arising as a result of the changes in the 
Company’s share of total ordinary employer contributions are also treated as actuarial gains or losses. 
Taxation 
Current tax, including UK corporation tax, is provided at amounts expected to be paid (or recovered) using the tax rates and laws that 
have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date. 
Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all temporary differences identified at the balance sheet date, except for differences arising on: 
● the initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction which is not a business combination and which at the time of the transaction 
affects neither accounting profit nor taxable profit; and 
● investments in subsidiaries where the Company is able to control the timing of the reversal of the difference and it is probable that the 
difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future. 
Temporary differences are differences between the carrying amount of the Company’s assets and liabilities and their tax base. 
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when the Company has a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets and liabilities and 
the deferred tax assets and liabilities relate to taxes levied by the same tax authority. 
Deferred tax assets that are not eligible for offset against deferred tax liabilities are recognised only when, on the basis of all available 
evidence, it can be regarded as probable that there will be suitable taxable profits in the foreseeable future, against which the deductible 
temporary difference can be utilised.  
Deferred tax is measured at the average tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which the asset is realised or the liability is 
settled, based on tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date. Measurement of 
deferred tax liabilities and assets reflects the tax consequences expected from the manner in which the asset or liability is recovered or 
settled. 
The tax expense for the period comprises current and deferred tax. Tax is recognised in the Income Statement, except to the extent that it 
relates to items recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity. In this case, the tax is also recognised in other 
comprehensive income or directly in equity, respectively. 
Financial instruments 
The Company’s accounting policies for financial instruments are consistent with those of the Group as disclosed in note S2 to the 
consolidated Group Financial Statements. The Company’s financial risk management policies are consistent with those of the Group and 
are described in the Strategic Report – Principal Risks and Uncertainties on pages 52 to 62 and in note S3 to the consolidated Group 
Financial Statements.  
Presentation of derivative financial instruments 
In line with the Group’s accounting policy for derivative financial instruments, the Company has classified those derivatives held for the 
purpose of treasury management as current or non-current, based on expected settlement dates.  
Provisions 
A provision is recognised when the Company has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past event that can be 
measured reliably and it is probable that an outflow of economic benefit will be required to settle the obligation.

Gas and Liquids Reserves (Unaudited) 
 Centrica plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 | 201 
The Group’s estimates of reserves of gas and liquids are reviewed as part of the full year reporting process and updated accordingly. 
A number of factors affect the volumes of gas and liquids reserves, including the available reservoir data, commodity prices and future 
costs. Due to the inherent uncertainties and the limited nature of reservoir data, estimates of reserves are subject to change as additional 
information becomes available.  
The Group discloses 2P gas and liquids reserves, representing the central estimate of future hydrocarbon recovery. Reserves for Centrica 
operated fields are estimated by in-house technical teams composed of geoscientists and reservoir engineers. Reserves for non-operated 
fields are estimated by the operator, but are subject to internal review and challenge. 
As part of the internal control process related to reserves estimation, an assessment of the reserves, including the application of the 
reserves definitions is undertaken by an independent technical auditor. An annual reserves assessment has been carried out by Gaffney, 
Cline & Associates for the Group’s global reserves. Reserves are estimated in accordance with a formal policy and procedure standard. 
The Group has estimated 2P gas and liquids reserves in Europe.  
The principal fields in Europe are Kvitebjørn, Statfjord, Hejre, Ivar Aasen, Cygnus, Maria, South and North Morecambe, Rhyl and Chiswick. 
The principal field in Centrica Storage is the Rough field. The European reserves estimates are consistent with the guidelines and 
definitions of the Society of Petroleum Engineers, the Society of Petroleum Evaluation Engineers and the World Petroleum Council’s 
Petroleum Resources Management System using accepted principles.

INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT TO THE DIRECTORS OF CENTRICA PLC AND ITS LICENSEES 
In our opinion, the accompanying statement (the ‘Consolidated Segmental Statement’ or ‘CSS’) of Centrica plc and its Licensees for the 
year ended 31 December 2017 is prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with: 
● the requirements of Ofgem’s Standard Condition 19A of the Gas and Electricity Supply Licences and Standard Condition 16B of the 
Electricity Generation Licences established by the regulator Ofgem; and 
● the basis of preparation on pages 210 to 212. 
We have audited the Consolidated Segmental Statement of Centrica plc and its Licensees (as listed in footnote (i)) (the Group) for the year 
ended 31 December 2017 in accordance with the terms of our engagement letter dated 19 January 2018. The Consolidated Segmental 
Statement has been prepared by the Directors of Centrica plc and its Licensees based on the requirements of Ofgem’s Standard 
Condition 19A of the Gas and Electricity Supply Licences and Standard Condition 16B of the Electricity Generation Licences (together, the 
‘Licences’) and the basis of preparation on pages 210 to 212. 
Basis for opinion 
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK) (ISAs (UK)). Our responsibilities under those 
standards are further described in the auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the CSS section of our report.  
We are independent of the Company in accordance with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the CSS in the United 
Kingdom, including the FRC’s Ethical Standard, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these 
requirements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.  
Emphasis of matter – basis of accounting 
We draw attention to pages 210 to 212 of the CSS which describes the basis of accounting. The CSS is prepared to assist the Company 
in complying with the requirements of Ofgem’s Standard Condition 19A of the Gas and Electricity Supply Licences and Standard 
Condition 16B of the Electricity Generation Licences established by the Regulator Ofgem. The basis of preparation is not the same as 
segmental reporting under IFRS and/or statutory reporting. As a result, the CSS may not be suitable for another purpose. Our opinion is 
not modified in respect of this matter. 
Conclusions relating to going concern 
We are required by ISAs (UK) to report in respect of the following matters where: 
● the Directors’ use of the going concern basis of accounting in preparation of the CSS is not appropriate; or 
● the Directors have not disclosed in the CSS any identified material uncertainties that may cast significant doubt about the Group’s ability 
to continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting for a period of at least twelve months from the date when the CSS is 
authorised for issue. 
We have nothing to report in respect of these matters. 
Other information 
The Directors are responsible for other information. The other information comprises the information included in the annual report, other 
than the Financial Statements and CSS and our auditor’s reports thereon. Our opinion on the Financial Statements does not cover the 
other information and we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.  
In connection with our audit of the CSS, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other 
information is materially inconsistent with the CSS or our knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. 
If we identify such material inconsistencies or apparent material misstatements, we are required to determine whether there is a material 
misstatement in the CSS or a material misstatement of the other information. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that 
there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact.  
We have nothing to report in respect of these matters.  
Responsibilities of the Directors 
The Directors are responsible for the preparation of the CSS in accordance with the Licences and the basis of preparation on pages 210 
to 212 and for such internal control as the Directors determine is necessary to enable the preparation of the CSS that is free from material 
misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. 
In preparing the CSS the Directors are responsible for assessing the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as 
applicable, matters relating to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the Directors either intend to 
liquidate the Group or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so. 
Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the CSS 
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the CSS as a whole is free from material misstatement, whether due to 
fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a 
guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs (UK) will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements 
can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to 
influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of this CSS.  
A further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the CSS is located on the Financial Reporting Council’s website at: 
frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities. This description forms part of our auditor’s report.

Condition 16B of the Electricity Generation Licences established by the Regulator Ofgem. The basis of preparation is not the same as 
segmental reporting under IFRS and/or statutory reporting. As a result, the CSS may not be suitable for another purpose. Our opinion is 
not modified in respect of this matter. 
Conclusions relating to going concern 
We are required by ISAs (UK) to report in respect of the following matters where: 
● the Directors’ use of the going concern basis of accounting in preparation of the CSS is not appropriate; or 
● the Directors have not disclosed in the CSS any identified material uncertainties that may cast significant doubt about the Group’s ability 
to continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting for a period of at least twelve months from the date when the CSS is 
authorised for issue. 
We have nothing to report in respect of these matters. 
Other information 
The Directors are responsible for other information. The other information comprises the information included in the annual report, other 
than the Financial Statements and CSS and our auditor’s reports thereon. Our opinion on the Financial Statements does not cover the 
other information and we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.  
In connection with our audit of the CSS, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other 
information is materially inconsistent with the CSS or our knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. 
If we identify such material inconsistencies or apparent material misstatements, we are required to determine whether there is a material 
misstatement in the CSS or a material misstatement of the other information. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that 
there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact.  
We have nothing to report in respect of these matters.  
Responsibilities of the Directors 
The Directors are responsible for the preparation of the CSS in accordance with the Licences and the basis of preparation on pages 210 
to 212 and for such internal control as the Directors determine is necessary to enable the preparation of the CSS that is free from material 
misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. 
In preparing the CSS the Directors are responsible for assessing the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as 
applicable, matters relating to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the Directors either intend to 
liquidate the Group or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so. 
Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the CSS 
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the CSS as a whole is free from material misstatement, whether due to 
fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a 
guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs (UK) will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements 
can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to 
influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of this CSS.  
A further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the CSS is located on the Financial Reporting Council’s website at: 
frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities. This description forms part of our auditor’s report.

CENTRICA PLC OPERATIONAL REPORTING STRUCTURE  
Below is a summary of the Centrica plc Group’s (Group) operational reporting structure. The CSS financial data has been extracted from 
the Centrica plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 operating segments rather than with reference to specific legal entities. Certain 
activities included in the Group’s operating segments have been excluded from the Generation and Supply segments of the CSS on the 
basis they are non-licensed activities (for example Business Services and trading activity unrelated to Generation or Supply) as illustrated 
below. The Centrica plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 provides operating segment results in note 4. A full reconciliation between the 
relevant operating segment results and those disclosed for ‘Domestic Supply’, ‘Non-Domestic Supply’ and ‘Generation’ in this CSS is

GLOSSARY OF TERMS 
● ‘WACOF/E/G’ is weighted average cost of fuel (nuclear), electricity (supply) and gas (thermal and supply) calculated by dividing direct 
fuel costs by volumes. For the Thermal sub-segment the cost of carbon emissions is added to direct fuel costs before dividing by the 
generated volume. 
● ‘EBITDA’ is earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation, and is calculated by subtracting total operating costs from 
revenue. 
● ‘DA’ is depreciation and amortisation. 
● ‘EBIT’ is earnings before interest and tax, and is calculated by subtracting total operating costs, depreciation and amortisation from total 
revenue. 
● ‘Supply EBIT margin’ is a profit margin expressed as a percentage and calculated by dividing EBIT by total revenue and multiplying by 
100 for the Supply segment. 
● ‘Supply PAT’ is profit after tax but before interest and is calculated by subtracting Group adjusted tax from EBIT for the Supply 
segment. 
● ‘Supply PAT margin’ is a profit margin expressed as a percentage and calculated by dividing Supply PAT by total revenue and 
multiplying by 100 for the Supply segment.  
● ‘Volume’ for Supply is supplier volumes at the meter point (i.e. net of losses); Generation volume is the volume of power that can 
actually be sold in the wholesale market (i.e. generation volumes after losses up to the point where power is received under the 
Balancing and Settlement Code but before subsequent losses). 
● ‘Average customer numbers/sites’ are calculated by adding average monthly customer numbers/sites (as defined in the basis of 
preparation) and dividing by 12.

Limited (CEL), our market-facing legal entity. CEL forms part of our non-licensed element of Energy Marketing & Trading function and also conducts trading for the purpose of making profits 
in its own right. The Supply segment is also able to enter into market trades directly as part of its within day balancing activities (as well as external bilateral contracts). 
(iii) ‘Matches own generation with own supply’ is undertaken in ‘Another part of the business’ (by CEL at market referenced prices), outside of the Generation and Supply segments. 
(iv) A separate team forecasts the wholesale price for the benefit and use of the entire Group. This team does not formally reside in any particular segment but their costs are recharged across 
the Group.  
Key: 
 Function resides and profit/loss recorded in segment. 
–  Neither function nor profit/loss reside in segment. 
Glossary of terms 
● ‘Scheduling decisions’ means the decision to run individual generation units. 
● ‘Responsible for interactions with the Balancing Market’ means interactions with the Balancing Mechanism in electricity. 
● ‘Interacts with wider market participants to buy/sell energy’ means the business unit is responsible for interacting with wider market 
participants to buy/sell energy, not the entity responsible for the buy/sell decision itself, which falls under ‘Responsible for implementing 
hedging policy/makes decisions to buy/sell energy’. 
● ‘Matches own generation with own supply’ means where there is some internal matching of generation and supply before either 
generation or supply interact with the wider market.  
● ‘Forecasts total system demand’ means forecasting total system electricity demand or total system gas demand. 
● ‘Forecasts customer demand’ means forecasting the total demand of own supply customers. 
● ‘Bears shape risk after initial hedge until market allows full hedge’ means the business unit which bears financial risk associated  
with hedges made before the market allows fully shaped hedging. 
● ‘Bears short-term risk for variance between demand and forecast’ means the business unit which bears financial risk associated  
with too little or too much supply for own customer demand.

BASIS OF PREPARATION 
The following notes provide a summary of the basis of preparation of the 2017 submission.
The Ofgem CSS segments our Supply and Generation activities and provides a measure of profitability, weighted average cost of fuel, and 
volumes, in order to increase energy market transparency for consumers and other stakeholders. 
These statements have been prepared by the Directors of Centrica plc and its Licensees in accordance with Standard Condition 16B of 
the Electricity Generation Licences and Standard Condition 19A of the Electricity and Gas Supply Licences and the basis of preparation. 
Throughout the basis of preparation the first paragraph number relates to the generation licence and the second to the supply licence 
conditions respectively.  
The financial data provided has been taken from the relevant licensee’s and affiliate’s financial information for the year ended  
31 December 2017, included in the Centrica plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 which have been prepared under IFRS as adopted by 
the EU (in accordance with paragraph 3/19A.3). 
The CSS has been prepared on a going concern basis, as described in the Directors’ Report and note 24(b) in the Centrica plc Annual 
Report and Accounts 2017. 
For the Generation segment, we have included the financial results from all activities that relate to our generation licences with the 
exception of held for sale activities in relation to renewables up to disposal in February 2017. For clarity the following judgements have 
been made: 
● where a sub-segment (for example Nuclear or Thermal) has undertaken trades to optimise the result of their underlying generation (for 
example through our Energy Marketing & Trading business), the net revenue and result from these trades has been included in the CSS 
sub-segment as they are considered to be related to our generation licences; 
● the Group has a long-term tolling contract in respect of the Spalding power station, but does not specifically hold the generation 
licence. This arrangement provides the Group with the right to nominate 100% of the plant capacity in return for a mix of capacity 
payments and operating payments. We do not own the power station and the Group does not control the physical dispatch of the 
asset. This contractual arrangement has been accounted for as a finance lease (under IFRS) and therefore the financial result and 
volume has been included in the Thermal sub-segment, within the Generation segment; 
● Brigg and Roosecote power stations had their licences revoked on 2 July 2015 (at their request) because they no longer required an 
electricity generation licence and are now exempt. Whilst we do not specifically hold a generation licence for these power stations, the 
financial results from these businesses have been included in the Thermal sub-segment and hence within the Generation segment; 
● the Group has a 20% equity interest in Lake Acquisitions Limited, which owns eight nuclear power stations (through its indirect 
investment in EDF Energy Nuclear Generation Limited). Although we do not specifically hold a generation licence for any of the nuclear 
stations, our gross share of the financial result from this business (including any contractual arrangements) has been included in the 
Nuclear sub-segment and hence within the Generation segment; and 
● where power is purchased from third parties (for example from wind farms, power stations or other bilateral arrangements) and we do 
not have an equity interest in, or a finance leasing arrangement (from an IFRS perspective) over the assets that generate this power, the 
result related to these activities is excluded from the Generation segment. In all cases, the Generation segment reports direct fuel costs 
and generation volumes on a consistent basis (if the purchase cost is a direct fuel cost, then the electricity generated is reported  
in volume). 
Domestic Supply represents the revenue and associated costs in supplying gas and electricity to residential customers in the UK. 
Non-Domestic Supply represents the revenue and associated costs in supplying gas and electricity to business customers in the UK. 
As a voluntary disclosure, to aid comparability, a summarised 2016 CSS with margins has been included within the report.  
Revenues 
Revenues, costs and profits of the Licensees have been defined below and prepared in compliance with the Group’s accounting policies 
as detailed in notes 2, 3 and S2 of the Centrica plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017, except for joint ventures and associates which are 
presented gross (in accordance with paragraph 4(a)/19A.4(a)). 
● Revenue from sales of electricity and gas for the Supply segment is recognised on the basis of gas and electricity supplied during the 
year to both domestic and non-domestic customers.  
● Revenue from sales of electricity and gas includes an assessment of energy supplied to customers between the date of the last meter 
reading and the year end (unread). For the respective Supply segments this means electricity and gas sales. Revenue for domestic 
supply is after deducting dual fuel discounts where applicable, with the discount split evenly between electricity and gas. Government 
mandated social tariffs and discounts, such as the Warm Home Discount, and other social discounts, have also been deducted from 
Domestic Supply revenues directly, charged specifically to each fuel. 
● Revenue from sales of electricity for the Generation segment is recognised on the basis of power supplied during the year. Power 
purchases and sales entered into to optimise the performance of each of the power Generation segments are presented net within revenue.

BASIS OF PREPARATION 
● The financial risks and rewards of owning and using the Group’s power stations reside entirely in the reported Generation segment. 
● Other respective segmental revenues not related to the sale of gas or power have been separately disclosed. Other revenues include: 
– £90.8 million (2016: £81.0 million) in Domestic Electricity Supply and £81.0 million (2016: £77.6 million) in Domestic Gas Supply 
primarily relating to New Housing Connections and smart meter installations;  
– £26.8 million (2016: £24.7 million) in Thermal principally relating to Supplementary Balancing Reserve (SBR), Short Term Operating 
Reserve (STOR) and Triad revenue; and 
– £11.0 million (2016: £6.0 million) revenue in Nuclear not directly related to energy sales, such as capacity market income and 
provision of miscellaneous services to other nuclear facilities. 
Direct fuel costs 
Direct fuel costs for both Generation and Supply include electricity, gas, nuclear fuel and imbalance costs.  
● Energy supply to Domestic and Non-Domestic energy customers is procured at a market referenced price, through a combination of 
bilateral, OTC and exchange-based trades/contracts (see table below). Where energy is procured from within the Group it is also at a 
market referenced price on an OTC basis. The market referenced prices used are those prevailing at the time of procurement, which 
may differ from the price prevailing at the time of supply. 
● Domestic and Non-Domestic fixed price products are hedged based upon anticipated demand at the start of the contract period. The 
majority of the gas and power for Non-Domestic energy and Domestic energy tariff products is purchased in advance (see table below). 
● The exact Domestic and Non-Domestic purchasing patterns vary in response to the outlook for commodity markets and commercial 
factors. 
● The Generation segment purchases gas and sells all of its energy at market referenced prices. Gas for CCGTs is procured at market 
referenced prices through a combination of OTC and exchange based trades/contracts. The cost to the power stations will reflect 
market referenced prices at the time of procurement, and so may differ from the price prevailing at the time of physical supply.  
How we procure electricity, gas and carbon: 
Long form bilateral  
contracts (‘bilateral’) 
Individually negotiated contracts with non-standardised terms and conditions which may relate to size, duration 
or flexibility. Pricing is predominantly indexed to published market referenced prices, adjusted for transfer of 
risks, cost of carry and administration. 
Over-the-counter (‘OTC’) Broker supported market of standardised products, predominantly performed via screen-based trading. These 
transactions are between two parties, leaving both parties exposed to the other’s default with no necessary 
intermediation of any exchange. An internal OTC price may be provided where market liquidity prevents 
external trading, with prices that are reflective of market conditions at the time of execution.  
Exchange Regulated electronic platform (notably ICE, APX, and N2EX) where standardised products are traded on 
exchange through the intermediary of the clearing house which becomes the counterparty to the trade. 
Membership of a clearing house is required which entails posting of cash or collateral as margin.  
WACOF/WACOE/WACOG 
● For Generation this represents the weighted average input cost of gas, carbon and nuclear fuel, shown as £/MWh, used by the 
Generation business. Gas for CCGTs is procured at market referenced prices through a combination of OTC and exchange-based 
trades/contracts. The cost to the power stations will reflect market referenced prices at the time of procurement, and so may differ from 
the price prevailing at the time of physical supply.  
● For Supply this covers the wholesale energy cost, the energy element of reconciliation by difference (RBD) costs and balancing and 
shaping costs incurred by the Supply licensees. Again, gas and electricity is procured at market referenced prices through a 
combination of bilateral, OTC and exchange-based trades/contracts. The cost for the Supply business will reflect market referenced 
prices at the time of procurement, and so may differ from the price prevailing at the time of physical supply. Where gas is procured 
using (predominantly indexed) bilateral contracts, the fuel cost is then allocated between Domestic and Non-Domestic Supply using 
annually updated fixed percentages based on the historical split of tariff book volumes. Gas and Electricity balancing costs are allocated 
between Domestic and Non-Domestic Supply based on their respective volumes multiplied by an appropriate industry referenced price 
(for example APX or SAP). 
● For electricity Supply the weighted average cost of electricity is shown as £/MWh. For gas Supply, the weighted average cost of gas is 
shown as p/th. 
Direct costs 
Direct costs for Supply and Generation are broken down into network costs, environmental and social obligation costs and other direct 
costs.  
● Network costs for Supply and Generation include transportation costs, BSUOS and the transport element of RBD costs. Supply 
transportation costs include transportation and LNG costs, including £38.4 million incurred by Gas Domestic Supply in 2017, which 
enables the segment to secure supply by giving the ability to bring gas into the UK from overseas (2016: £40.8 million). 
● Environmental and social obligation costs for Domestic Supply include ROCs, FIT and ECO. Non-Domestic Supply includes the cost of 
LECs, ROCs and FIT. Within the Domestic and Non-Domestic segments, the costs of LECs, FIT and ROCs are included within 
Electricity, and ECO is allocated between Electricity and Gas based on the relevant legislation. Environmental and social obligation costs 
for the Generation segment relate to EU ETS carbon emission costs and carbon tax. 
● Other direct costs for Generation include employee and maintenance costs.

● Other direct costs for Supply include brokers’ costs and sales commissions when the costs have given rise directly to revenue, that is, 
producing a sale. They also include Elexon and Xoserve market participation and wider Smart metering programme costs. 
Indirect costs 
Indirect costs for Supply and Generation include operating costs such as sales and marketing, bad debt costs, costs to serve, IT, HR, 
finance, property, staffing and billing and metering costs (including smart meter costs). 
● Indirect costs for the Generation, Domestic and Non-Domestic Supply segments (including corporate and business unit recharges) are 
allocated based on relevant drivers, which include turnover, headcount, operating profit, net book value of fixed assets and 
proportionate use/benefit. For Supply, indirect costs (including corporate recharges but excluding bad debt costs) are primarily 
allocated between Electricity and Gas on the basis of customer numbers (Domestic) and sites (Non-Domestic). Bad debt costs are 
allocated between Electricity and Gas on the basis of actual bad debt cost by individual contract in the billing system (Domestic) and on 
the basis of revenues (Non-Domestic). 
Other  
● For Supply, depreciation and amortisation is allocated between Electricity and Gas on the basis of customer numbers (Domestic) and 
sites (Non-Domestic). 
● For the purposes of Supply PAT, tax is allocated between Gas and Electricity within both Domestic and Non-Domestic Supply based on 
their relative proportions of EBIT. Note 4(c) of the Centrica plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 provides details of the adjusted 
operating profit after tax of the relevant operating segments.  
● For the Domestic Supply segment, customer numbers are stated based on the number of district meter point reference numbers 
(MPRNs) and meter point administration numbers (MPANs) in our billing system (for gas and electricity respectively), where it shows an 
active point of delivery and a meter installation. As a result, our customer numbers do not include those meter points where a meter 
may recently have been installed but the associated industry registration process has yet to complete, as the meter information will not 
be present in our billing system. 
● For the Non-Domestic Supply segment, sites are based on the number of distinct MPRNs and MPANs in our billing system for gas and 
electricity respectively. 
Transfer pricing for electricity, gas and generation licensees in accordance with paragraph 4(d)/19A.4(d) 
There are no specific energy supply agreements between the Generation and Supply segments. 
The Group continues to ensure transfer pricing methodologies are appropriate and up to date. In order to meet this requirement, the 
Group ensured all transfer pricing and cost allocation methodologies were internally reviewed, updated and collated in a central repository. 
Internal Audit performed a limited procedures review of the documentation in January 2018 to give comfort over compliance with the 
Ofgem guidelines.  
Treatment of joint ventures and associates 
The share of results of joint ventures and associates for the year ended 31 December 2017 principally arises from the Group’s interests in 
the entities listed on page 206, with the exception of our investment in Lincs Wind Farm Limited, which was classified as held for sale in 
the period to disposal. 
Under paragraph 5 of the Conditions, the information provided in the CSS includes our gross share of revenues, costs, profits and 
volumes of joint ventures and associates. In preparing the CSS, joint ventures and associates (which hold a UK generation licence or 
exemption) are accounted for as follows: 
● our proportionate share of revenues of joint ventures and associates has been included within revenue; 
● our proportionate share of the profit before tax of joint ventures and associates has been included within EBIT and EBITDA; and 
● our proportionate share of the generation volumes of joint ventures and associates has been included within the generation volumes. 
For each of the above items, our share of the income and expenses of the joint ventures or associates has been combined line-by-line 
within the relevant item of the CSS. 
The Supply segment has investments in associates but because the investees’ businesses do not relate to the sale of gas and electricity, 
the share of result (revenue of £0.1 million (2016: £0.7 million), EBIT loss of £0.1 million (2016: £0.5 million loss)) has been included net 
within indirect costs rather than gross, on a line-by-line basis.  
Exceptional items and certain re-measurements 
Mark-to-market adjustments, profits or losses on disposal, restructuring costs, impairment charges and impairment write-backs that have 
been identified in the Centrica plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 are excluded from the CSS. For further details of excluded 
exceptional items and certain re-measurements see note 7 in the Centrica plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017.  
The Nuclear sub-segment result includes a £17.0 million (2016: £20.9 million) profit from the revaluation of contingent valuation rights, 
related to the original acquisition of the Nuclear investment. 
The Domestic Supply segment includes a charge of £3.9 million for the impairment of an associate. This item has been included in the 
Supply segment as it is not exceptional in size, nature or incidence and does not materially change the Domestic Supply result. 
In 2016, the Non-Domestic Supply segment included fines of £9.5 million for billing failures and £4.5 million for delays in smart meter roll-
outs (offset by a £4.0 million provision previously held). There were no transactions of this nature in 2017. 
A reconciliation of the Segmental Statement revenue, EBIT, depreciation and Supply PAT to the 2017 audited Centrica plc Annual Report 
and Accounts has been included in accordance with paragraphs 4(b) & (c)/19A.4 (b) & (c) and 6/19A.6.

(i) The table above reconciles the Generation segment to Central Power Generation and Distributed Energy & Power, the Domestic Supply segment to UK Home and the Non-Domestic Supply 
segment to UK Business in note 4 to the 2017 Centrica plc Annual Report and Accounts. Also included in note 4 is a reconciliation to the IFRS compliant statutory result reported by the 
Centrica plc Group. 
Notes: 
1. UK Home includes Home Services and UK Business includes Business Services which are non-licensed activities and have been 
deducted to reconcile these CSS numbers. 
2. The share of Domestic and Non-Domestic Revenues, Operating Profit (EBIT), Depreciation (including amortisation) and PAT (adjusted 
operating profit after tax) as provided in note 4 of the Centrica plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017, has been split between Gas  
and Electricity. 
3. £538.0 million of revenues relating to the Group’s share of joint ventures and associates in Generation are included in the CSS for 
Nuclear revenues. £58.0 million of EBIT in the Generation segment relates to profit from joint ventures for Nuclear. Additionally, costs 
relating to the Group’s share of joint ventures and associates: £101.5 million direct fuel costs, £216.7 million direct costs, £19.3 million 
indirect costs and £142.5 million depreciation and amortisation are included. The results of joint ventures and associates are shown 
separately in the Centrica plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 in notes 6 and 14. 
4. £597.1 million of intra-segment revenues, split £534.3 million between the joint ventures and associates and the Generation segment 
(included in the £538.0 million of joint venture and associate revenues) and £62.8 million between the CPG and EM&T segment (related 
to power station tolls), are excluded from the CSS. 
5. DE&P includes operations outside the UK. Revenues of £151.3 million, EBIT loss of £55.8 million and depreciation of £15.5 million have 
consequently been excluded from the Generation segment of the CSS. 
6. £332.6 million of revenues and an EBIT loss of £13.9 million relating to Centrica’s EM&T optimisation are included in the Generation 
segment of the CSS. 
7. EBIT of £5.9 million and a post-tax gain of £4.7 million in Domestic costs arises from a provision release related to a non-UK disposal in 
a prior period.

Definitions and reconciliation of adjusted performance measures
Centrica’s 2017 consolidated Group Financial Statements include a number of non-GAAP measures. These measures are chosen as they 
provide additional useful information on business performance and underlying trends. They are also used to measure the Group’s performance 
against its strategic financial framework. They are not however, defined terms under IFRS and may not be comparable with similarly titled 
measures reported by other companies. Where possible they have been reconciled to the statutory equivalents from the primary statements 
(Group Income Statement (‘I/S’), Group Balance Sheet (‘B/S’), Group Cash Flow Statement (‘C/F’)) or the notes to the Financial Statements.
Adjusted operating profit, adjusted earnings and adjusted operating cash flow have been defined and reconciled separately in notes 2, 
4 and 10 to the consolidated Group Financial Statements where further explanation of the measures is given. Additional performance 
measures are used within this announcement to help explain the performance of the Group and these are defined and reconciled below.
EBITDA
EBITDA is the profit measure that provides the bridge between the Income Statement and the Group’s key cash metrics.

Underlying adjusted operating cash flow
Adjusted operating cash flow is the key metric used to assess the cash generating performance of the Group. Underlying adjusted operating 
cash flow makes further adjustments for foreign exchange and the commodity price movements that most impact the Group, which are 
outside its control, along with other material one-off items, to provide a comparable year-on-year measure of cash generation that more 
closely reflects business performance.
The calculation has been amended to make adjustments to rebase adjusted operating cash flow to reflect the prevailing foreign exchange 
and commodity prices in 2015 rather than those in the current reporting period. This provides a fixed reference point and prevents the need 
to continually recalculate the comparative periods and allows management to measure underlying adjusted operating cash flow growth since 
2015, the announcement of the Strategic Review.

commodity price in 2015.

Underlying adjusted operating cash flow is adjusted operating cash flow as defined in note 2 and reconciled in note 4(f). It has been adjusted 
for the impacts of commodity price movements on Exploration & Production (E&P) and nuclear assets and foreign exchange movements. 
It has also been adjusted for one-off working capital movements in UK Business. This follows billing performance issues after the implementation 
of a new system in 2014, impacting the Group’s ability to collect cash from customers and therefore its adjusted operating cash flow. As a 
consequence, the working capital movement for UK Business has been removed from underlying adjusted operating cash flow.  
Centrica plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 | 217
E&P free cash flow
Free cash flow is used as an additional cash flow metric for the E&P business due to its asset-intensive nature. This metric provides a measure 
of the cash generating performance of the E&P business, taking account of its investment activity.

Free cash flow 376 166 127%
(i) 2017 net disposals include Trinidad and Tobago, Canada and NSIP (ETS) Limited (see note 12(d)) and other small E&P asset disposals. 2016 net disposals include Skene 
and Buckland, Trinidad and Tobago Blocks 1a and 1b, and other small E&P asset disposals.
E&P free cash flow is E&P’s adjusted operating cash flow, as defined in note 2 and reconciled in note 4(f), less the business’s capital 
expenditure and net disposals. Capital expenditure is the net cash flow on capital expenditure and purchases of businesses (less than  
£100 million). Net disposals is the net cash flow from sales of businesses, property, plant and equipment and intangible assets, disposals  
of interests in joint ventures and associates, net of investments in joint ventures and associates. Cash acquired through the Spirit Energy 
transaction has been excluded since this is an unusual acquisition whereby there was no cash consideration and hence this has been 
separately highlighted in the calculation.
Return on average capital employed (ROACE)
Post-tax ROACE is one of the key performance metrics in the financial framework of the Group and represents the return the Group makes 
from capital employed in its wholly owned assets and its investments in joint ventures and associates.

Average capital employed 6,875 6,728
ROACE 14% 16% (2ppt)
Average capital employed takes the Group’s net assets excluding net debt and deducts the net retirement benefit obligation and other 
derivative financial instruments (together with their associated deferred tax balances) because these represent unrealised positions and 
therefore do not reflect true capital employed. They are also subject to market driven volatility which could materially distort the ROACE 
calculation. Responsible Business – Performance Measures

Assurance
We engaged PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP (‘PwC’) to undertake a limited assurance engagement, reporting to Centrica plc only, using 
International Standard on Assurance Engagements (‘ISAE’) 3000 (Revised): ‘Assurance Engagements Other Than Audits or Reviews of 
Historical Financial Information’ and ISAE 3410: ‘Assurance Engagements on Greenhouse Gas Statements’ over the KPIs on pages 31, 36,  
41, 43, 70-71, 76, 85, 89 and below, that have been highlighted with the symbol ‘†’. They have provided an unqualified opinion in relation 
to the relevant KPIs and data and their full assurance opinion is available at centrica.com/assurance 
A limited assurance engagement is substantially less in scope than a reasonable assurance engagement in relation to both the risk 
assessment procedures, including an understanding of internal control, and the procedures performed in response to the assessed risks. 
Non-financial performance information, including greenhouse gas quantification in particular, is subject to more inherent limitations than 
financial information. It is important to read the selected responsible business information contained in the Annual Report and Accounts 2017 
in the context of PwC’s full limited assurance opinion and Centrica’s Basis of Reporting, which is also available in the assurance section of the 
website set out above.
