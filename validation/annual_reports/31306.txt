CHAIRMAN’S STATEMENT
I am pleased to introduce the 2017 Annual Report and 
Financial Statements. During 2017, the Group has made very 
promising progress in the development of its MEX-GOL, SV 
and VAS gas and condensate fields in north-eastern Ukraine, 
with significant improvements in production rates, leading to  
a much improved financial performance. 
At the Group’s MEX-GOL and SV fields, production was 
reasonably stable during the first half of 2017, but in June 
2017, the new MEX-109 well, utilising improved drilling 
and completion techniques developed as a result of recent 
studies, was completed successfully and put on production, 
and in August 2017, following completion of its workover, 
the SV-2 well was also put on production. Together, these 
successes have nearly doubled output from the MEX-GOL 
and SV fields. In addition, the VAS field has continued to 
produce consistently during the year. With the improved 
contribution from the new wells on the MEX-GOL and SV 
fields, aggregate production at the end of 2017 from all fields 
was approximately 2,800 boepd. This compares with an 
aggregate production rate of approximately 1,700 boepd at 
the end of 2016, which represents an increase of nearly 65% 
over the year.
The fiscal and economic situation in Ukraine continues 
to improve, with a better economic outlook, GDP growth 
and improved stability in the Ukrainian Hryvnia exchange 
rates, although the inflation rate did increase moderately. 
Nevertheless, there continue to be stresses in the economy 
and weaknesses in the Ukrainian banking sector.
The Ukrainian Government has implemented a number of 
reforms in the oil and gas industry in recent years, which 
include the deregulation of the gas supply market in late 2015, 
and more recently, reductions in the subsoil tax rates relating 
to oil and gas production and a proposed simplification of the 
regulatory procedures applicable to oil and gas exploration 
and production activities in Ukraine. 
The deregulation of the gas supply market, supported 
by electronic gas trading platforms and improved pricing 
transparency, has meant that the market gas prices in Ukraine 
now broadly correlate with the imported gas prices. During 
2017, gas prices were reasonably stable, allowing for some 
seasonal variation, and were higher than in 2016. Furthermore, 
condensate and LPG prices were also higher in 2017 by 
comparison with the previous year.
As regards the Group’s financial performance in the year 
ended 31 December 2017, I am pleased to report that 
the Group made a profit of $2.3 million (2016: $1.3 million 
loss), mainly as a result of improved revenues from higher 
production volumes and hydrocarbon prices. Cash generated 
from operations during the year was higher at $18.0 million 
(2016: $10.0 million). 
Board and Management Changes
During the year, there were significant changes to the 
management and Board of Directors of the Company. With 
effect from the start of August 2017, Sergii Glazunov became 
Chief Executive Officer, having previously been Finance 
Director, and Yevhen (Gene) Palyenka was appointed Chief 
Financial Officer. Later in August 2017, Bruce Burrows joined 
the Board as Non-Executive Director, and Adrian Coates 
stepped down from the Board at the same time.
I joined the Board as Non-Executive Director in September 
2017, and was appointed Non-Executive Chairman in October 
2017. At the same time, Phil Frank joined the Board as Non-
Executive Director, and Keith Henry and Alastair Graham 
stepped down from the Board. On behalf of the Board,  
I would like to thank each of Keith, Alastair and Adrian for 
their valued contributions during their respective tenures with 
the Company.
Outlook
While there are still challenges in the business environment in 
Ukraine, the situation is improving and the Group is continuing 
to progress the development of its Ukrainian fields. After the 
operational successes of 2017 and the increased production 
output during the year, we are looking forward to achieving 
further successes in the development activities planned for 
2018 and delivering a steadily increasing production and 
revenue stream in the future.
In conclusion, on behalf of the Board, I would like to thank all 
of our staff for the continued dedication and support they have 
shown during the year.

CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER’S STATEMENT
Introduction
The Group has made good progress at its Ukrainian fields 
during 2017, with the increase in development activity at the 
MEX-GOL and SV fields resulting in the successes of the 
MEX-109 well, which came on production in June 2017, and 
the SV-2 well, which came on production in August 2017, 
providing a significant boost to production rates.
During the year, the Group continued its work on the 
subsurface of the MEX-GOL and SV fields, utilising the results 
of P .D.F. Limited’s comprehensive re-evaluation study to plan 
additional development of these fields. This work included 
detailed reprocessing of the existing 3D seismic data, using 
the latest processing technology, with the reprocessed 
data now under interpretation. As well as the drilling of the 
MEX-109 well and the workover of the SV-2 well, the Group 
undertook workover operations on the GOL-2 and SV-6 
wells during the year to eliminate water ingress into the wells, 
but these operations were not successful and the Group is 
currently considering further remedial work on these wells. 
The Group also installed additional compression equipment, 
upgraded the gas processing facilities and pipeline network, 
and undertook remedial work on existing wells.
At the VAS field, planning took place for the acquisition of new 
3D seismic over the field and the drilling of the VAS-10 well, 
both of which activities commenced in early 2018.
Health, Safety, Environment and Security 
(“HSES”)
The Group is committed to maintaining the highest HSES 
standards and the effective management of these areas is an 
intrinsic element of the overall business ethos. Through strict 
enforcement of the Group’s HSES Management System, 
together with regular management meetings, training and the 
appointment of dedicated safety professionals, the Group 
strives to ensure that the impact of its business activities 
on its staff, contractors and the environment is as low as 
is reasonably practicable. The Group reports safety and 
environmental performance in accordance with industry 
practice and guidelines.
I am pleased to report that during 2017, a total of 448,618 
man-hours of staff and contractor time were recorded without 
a Lost Time Incident occurring. The total number of safe man-
hours now stands at over 1,444,850 man-hours without a 
Lost Time Incident. No environmental incidents were recorded 
during the year. 
Production
Average daily production from the MEX-GOL and SV fields 
over the year ended 31 December 2017 was 197,961 m³/d 
of gas, 47 m³/d of condensate and 24 m³/d of LPG (1,629 
boepd in aggregate) (2016: 157,228 m
3
/d of gas, 41 m
3
/d of 
condensate and 19 m³/d of LPG (1,321 boepd in aggregate)). 
Production rates improved significantly following the 
commencement of production from the MEX-109 well in June 
2017 and the SV-2 well in August 2017.
Average daily production from the VAS field for the year ended 
31 December 2017 was 86,242 m
3
/d of gas and 6.5 m
3
/d 
of condensate (608 boepd in aggregate) (Period from 4 July 
2016 to 31 December 2016: 82,624 m
3
/d of gas and 6.5 m
3
/d 
of condensate (556 boepd in aggregate)), contributing material 
volumes to the Group’s production output.
The Group’s average daily production for the period from 
1 January 2018 to 28 March 2018 from the MEX-GOL and SV 
field was 272,656 m³/d of gas, 53 m³/d of condensate and 
32 m³/d of LPG (2,169 boepd in aggregate) and from the VAS 
field was 86,214 m³/d of gas and 6.2 m³/d of condensate (606 
boepd in aggregate). 
Operations
The improving geopolitical situation in Ukraine, coupled with 
the stabilisation of the Ukrainian Hryvnia, higher hydrocarbon 
prices and improvements in the fiscal and economic situation 
over the last year, meant that the Group was able to increase 
the development programmes at its Ukrainian fields during 
2017.
At the MEX-GOL and SV fields, the Group continued to work 
with P .D.F. Limited to utilise its re-evaluation study of these 
fields, which involved analysis of all available geological, 
geophysical, petroleum engineering and well performance 
data. The continuing work included detailed reprocessing 
of existing 3D seismic data, using the latest processing 
technology, to try to improve the definition in such data. 
Interpretation of this new dataset is under way, with the 
intention of utilising it to refine the new geological subsurface 
model of the fields. This work, undertaken in conjunction with 
P .D.F. Limited, will enable the Group to refine its strategies 
for the further development of the fields, including the timing 
and level of future capital investment required to exploit the 
hydrocarbon resources.

The MEX-109 well, which was spudded in July 2016, targeted 
the Visean reservoirs (“B-Sands”) in the MEX-GOL field. The 
well was drilled to a depth of 4,873 metres, and completed 
in the B-20 Visean reservoir. It was brought on production in 
June 2017. The initial production rates were very encouraging 
and the well has been producing consistently in excess of 
90,000 m
3
/d since then. 
In early 2017, the Group entered into an agreement with NJSC 
Ukrnafta, the majority State-owned oil and gas producer, in 
relation to the SV-2 well, which is a suspended well owned 
by NJSC Ukrnafta located within the Group’s SV licence 
area. Under the agreement, the Group agreed to undertake 
a workover of the well, which, if successful, would result in 
the well being brought back into production. Pursuant to the 
agreement, the gas and condensate produced from the well 
is to be sold under an equal net profit-sharing arrangement 
between the Group and NJSC Ukrnafta. The workover 
operations were successful and production from the well 
recommenced in August 2017, providing a further significant 
boost to production volumes.
Following on from the success of the SV-2 well operations, in 
November 2017, the Group entered into a similar agreement 
with NJSC Ukrnafta, in relation to the SV-12 well, which is also 
a suspended well owned by NJSC Ukrnafta located within 
the SV licence area. The terms of the new agreement are 
fundamentally consistent with the agreement relating to the 
SV-2 well, including the equal net profit-sharing arrangement 
between the Group and NJSC Ukrnafta. Investigative work 
has been undertaken to ascertain the condition of the well and 
preparations for workover operations on the well are under 
way. It is anticipated that the workover operations will be 
concluded during the fourth quarter of 2018. 
The Group also undertook workover operations on the GOL-2 
and SV-6 wells during the year to eliminate water ingress 
into the wells. Although these operations were successful 
in preventing the water ingress, the wells did not return to 
production and are now under observation. The Group is 
currently considering further remedial work on these wells. 
Also at the MEX-GOL and SV fields, the Group installed 
additional compression equipment, upgraded the gas 
processing facilities and pipeline network, and undertook 
remedial work on existing wells.
At the VAS field during 2017, planning work took place for 
the acquisition of new 3D seismic data over the field and the 
drilling of the VAS-10 well. The acquisition of the 3D seismic is 
expected to be completed shortly and thereafter the data will 
be processed and interpreted. 
The VAS-10 well was spudded on 13 March 2018, with 
a planned depth of 3,450 metres. The well is designed to 
appraise horizons in the Visean formation, and to evaluate the 
western edge of field, at an offset of approximately 1 km from 
the nearest currently producing well. The drilling operations 
are scheduled to be completed in June 2018 and, subject to 
successful testing, production hook-up is anticipated during 
the third quarter of 2018. 
Outlook 
During 2018, the Group will continue the development of 
the MEX-GOL, SV and VAS fields. At the MEX-GOL and SV 
fields, the development programme includes revision of the 
geological model utilising the newly interpreted reprocessed 
seismic data, concluding the workover of the SV-12 well, 
planning for a new development well, investigating workover 
opportunities for other existing wells, installation of additional 
compression equipment, further upgrading of the gas 
processing facilities and pipeline network, and remedial work 
on existing wells, pipelines and other infrastructure. 
At the VAS field, the work on processing and interpreting the 
new 3D seismic data will continue, as will the drilling of the 
VAS-10 well. In addition, consideration and planning for a 
further appraisal/development well will be undertaken. It is also 
intended to undertake further evaluation of the VED area of the 
licence, which appears highly prospective on the current 2D 
seismic data and will benefit from the improved imaging of the 
new 3D seismic data. Work is also planned to upgrade the gas 
processing facilities, pipeline network and other infrastructure. 
It is also intended to commission updated assessments of the 
remaining reserves and resources at each of the MEX-GOL 
and SV fields and the VAS field, which will be undertaken by 
an independent petroleum reserves consultant later in 2018. 
The extensive re-evaluation of the MEX-GOL and SV fields by 
P .D.F. Limited, the interpretation work being undertaken on 
the reprocessed 3D seismic dataset and the ongoing revision 
of the geological model means that the Group considers that 
now is an appropriate time to undertake a reassessment of 
the remaining reserves and resources at the MEX-GOL and 
SV fields, and this reassessment is planned to be undertaken 
during the first half of 2018. Similarly, the interpretation of 
the newly acquired 3D seismic and associated subsurface 
studies, together with the data collected from the VAS-10 well 
at the VAS field, means that a reassessment of the remaining 
reserves and resources at the VAS field will also be appropriate 
by the end of 2018.

There has also been encouraging new legislation relating 
to the oil and gas sector in Ukraine, which demonstrates 
the Ukrainian Government’s stated intention to promote 
and support the domestic oil and gas production industry. 
These new measures include reductions in the subsoil 
taxes applicable to the production of hydrocarbons, which 
became effective for new wells from 1 January 2018 and for 
condensate production from 1 January 2019. Furthermore, 
there is newly announced legislation to simplify a number of 
the regulatory procedures relating to oil and gas exploration 
and production activities in Ukraine, which has passed through 
the Ukrainian Parliament and is now awaiting the signature of 
the President of Ukraine to bring it into law.
These measures, and the general improvement in the business 
climate in Ukraine, are encouraging and supportive of the 
independent oil and gas producers in Ukraine.
Finally, I would like to add my thanks to all of our staff for the 
continued hard work and dedication they have shown during 
this successful year.

OVERVIEW OF ASSETS AND RESERVES
ASSETS
1. MEX-GOL and SV fields 
Regal Petroleum Corporation Limited (a wholly owned subsidiary in the Group) holds a 100% working interest in and is the 
operator of the MEX-GOL and SV fields. The production licences extend over a combined area of 269 km², approximately 
200 km east of Kiev. The two licences are adjacent and the interests are operated and managed as one field. The licences 
were granted in July 2004 and have a duration of 20 years.
The fields are located, geologically, towards the middle of the Dnieper-Donets sedimentary basin which extends across the 
majority of north-east Ukraine. The vast majority of Ukrainian gas and condensate production comes from this basin. The 
reservoirs comprise a series of gently dipping Carboniferous sandstones of Visean age (“B-Sands”) inter-bedded with shales 
at approximately 4,700 metres below the surface, with a gross thickness between 800 metres and 1,000 metres. Analysis 
suggests that these deposits range from fluvial to deltaic in origin, and much of the trapping at these fields is stratigraphic 
in nature. Below these reservoirs is a thick sequence of shale above deeper, similar, sandstones which are encountered at a 
depth of around 5,800 metres. These sands are of Tournasian age (“T-Sands”) and may offer additional gas potential. Deeper 
sandstones of Devonian age (“D-Sands”) have also been penetrated in the fields.
2. VAS field 
LLC Prom-Enerho Produkt (a wholly owned subsidiary in the Group) holds a 100% working interest in and is the operator of the 
VAS field. The production licence extends over an area of 33.2 km² and is located approximately 17 km south-east of Kharkiv. 
The licence was granted in August 2012 and has a duration of 20 years.
The field is also located, geologically, towards the middle of the Dnieper-Donets sedimentary basin in the north-east of Ukraine. 
The field is trapped in an anticlinal structure broken into several faulted blocks, which are gently dipping to the north, stretching 
from the north-east to south-west along a main bounding fault. The gas is located in Carboniferous sandstones of Bashkirian, 
Serpukhovian and Visean age at depths of 2,900 – 3,400 metres below the surface.
RESERVES
1. MEX-GOL and SV fields 
The Group’s estimates of the remaining Reserves and Resources at the MEX-GOL and SV licence areas are derived from an 
assessment undertaken by independent petroleum consultants, ERC Equipoise Limited (“ERCE”), as at 31 December 2013 (the 
“ERCE Report”), which was announced on 25 March 2014. During the period from 1 January 2014 to 31 December 2017, the 
Group has produced 2.04 MMboe from these fields.
The ERCE Report estimated the remaining Reserves as at 31 December 2013 in the Visean B-Sands reservoirs of the MEX-GOL 
and SV fields, based on the drilling of ten further wells, as follows:

The Group made a profit of $2.3 million (2016: $1.3 million 
loss) during the year ended 31 December 2017, mainly as a 
result of improved revenue from higher production volumes 
and hydrocarbon prices. Revenue in the year, derived from 
the sale of the Group’s Ukrainian gas, condensate and LPG 
production, was higher at $35.1 million (2016: $25.7 million).
Cash generated from operations during the year increased 
to $18.0 million (2016: $10.0 million), as a result of higher

(UAH5,441/Mm
3
) gas, $51/bbl condensate and $43/bbl LPG). 
During the period from 1 January 2018 to 28 March 2018, the 
average realised gas, condensate and LPG prices were $277/
Mm
3
 (UAH7,574/Mm

), $70/bbl and $55/bbl respectively. The 
current realised gas price is $265/Mm
3
 (UAH6,972/Mm

). 
Since the deregulation of the gas supply market in Ukraine in 
October 2015, the market price for gas has broadly correlated 
to the price of imported gas, which generally reflects trends in 
European gas prices. Gas prices are also subject to seasonal 
variation. During the 2017 year, gas prices were reasonably 
stable, allowing for some seasonal variation, and were 
higher than in 2016, as were condensate and LPG prices by 
comparison with 2016.
In the first half of 2017, the Group commenced selling all of 
its gas production to LLC Smart Energy (“Smart Energy”), 
which is part of the PJSC Smart-Holding Group, which is 
ultimately controlled by Mr Vadim Novinskiy, who, through 
an indirect 54% majority shareholding, ultimately controls the 
Group. This arrangement came about as a consequence of 
the introduction of a number of new taxation regulations in 
Ukraine, which significantly increased the regulatory burden 
on affected companies. Due to the corporate structure of 
the Group, a substantial proportion of its gas production is 
produced by a non-Ukrainian subsidiary of the Group, which 
operates in Ukraine as a branch, or representative office as 
it is classified in Ukraine. As a result, the new tax regulations 
impose additional regulatory obligations on the Group’s 
potential customers, who may be less inclined to purchase 
the Group’s gas and/or may seek discounts on sales prices. 
In light of this situation, the Group and Smart Energy reached 
an agreement under which Smart Energy will purchase all of 
the Group’s gas production and assume responsibility for the 
regulatory obligations under the Ukrainian tax regulations, 
as well as combining the Group’s gas production with Smart 
Energy’s own gas production so as to sell such gas as 
combined volumes, which should result in higher sales prices 
due to the larger sales volumes. In order to cover Smart 
Energy’s sales, administration and regulatory compliance 
costs, the Group sells its gas to Smart Energy at a small 
discount to the gas sales prices achieved by Smart Energy, 
who sell the combined volumes in line with market prices. The 
terms of sale, effective from June 2017, for the Group’s gas 
to Smart Energy are (i) payment for one third of the estimated 
monthly volume of gas by the 20th of the month of delivery, 
and (ii) payment of the remaining balance by the 10th of the 
month following the month of delivery. As a consequence 
of their common ultimate control, the Company and Smart 
Energy are deemed to be related parties under the AIM Rules 
for Companies, and more details of this arrangement are set 
out in the announcement made on 30 June 2017, as well as in 
Notes 4 and 31 below.
The subsoil tax rates applicable to gas and condensate 
production were stable during the year at 29% for gas 
produced from deposits at depths above 5,000 metres and 
14% for gas produced from deposits below 5,000 metres, and 
45% for condensate produced from deposits above 5,000 
metres and 21% for condensate produced from deposits 
below 5,000 metres. 
However, in December 2017, the Ukrainian Government 
passed new legislation under which (i) for new wells drilled 
after 1 January 2018, the subsoil tax rates will be reduced 
from 29% to 12% for gas produced from deposits at depths 
above 5,000 metres and from 14% to 6% for gas produced 
from deposits below 5,000 metres, and (ii) with effect from 
1 January 2019 and applicable to all wells, the subsoil tax 
rates for condensate will be reduced from 45% to 29% for 
condensate produced from deposits above 5,000 metres and 
from 21% to 14% for condensate produced from deposits 
below 5,000 metres. 
In addition, with effect from 1 April 2017, a transmission tariff 
of UAH296.80/Mm
3
 ($11.00/Mm
3
) for use of the Ukrainian 
national pipeline system became applicable to oil and gas 
producers in Ukraine, including the Group. However, shortly 
after its imposition, the tariff was suspended following a legal 
challenge to the legality of the tariff, and it is currently uncertain 
if and/or when the tariff will be reinstated, and what the 
amount of the tariff may be.

Cost of sales for the year ended 31 December 2017 was 
higher at $24.3 million (2016: $18.6 million), mainly due to the 
inclusion of a full year of the cost of sales of hydrocarbons 
from the VAS field of $5.7 million (Period from 4 July 2016 to 
31 December 2016: $2.6 million). 
Administrative expenses for the year were higher at $5.3 
million (2016: $4.7 million), primarily as a result of the inclusion 
of administrative expenses relating to LLC Prom-Enerho 
Produkt (“PEP”), the owner of the VAS field, of $0.4 million 
(Period from 4 July 2016 to 31 December 2016: $0.1 million) 
and staff termination compensation of $0.2 million (2016: nil).
The tax charge for the year of $4.3 million (2016: $4.1 million 
charge) comprises a current tax charge of $3.0 million (2016: 
$1.9 million charge) and a deferred tax charge of $1.3 million 
(2016: $2.2 million charge). 
The Group has recognised a deferred tax asset of $9.3 
million at 31 December 2017 (31 December 2016: $11.1 
million). This comprises a deferred tax asset of $2.6 million 
(31 December 2016: $3.7 million) in relation to UK tax losses 
carried forward, and $6.7 million (31 December 2016: $7.4 
million) relating to the Group’s MEX-GOL and SV asset and the 
provision for decommissioning in Ukraine, which is recognised 
on the tax effect of temporary timing differences between the 
carrying value of such asset and its tax base. The reduction in 
the deferred tax asset in 2017 is primarily due to a decrease of 
forecasted taxable income for the following five years caused 
by partial settlement of intra-group loans receivable by the 
Company. The Group has also recognised a deferred tax 
liability of $0.8 million at 31 December 2017 (31 December 
2016: $1.2 million) relating to the Group’s VAS asset in 
Ukraine, which is recognised on the tax effect of temporary 
timing differences between the carrying value of such asset 
and its tax base, mainly due to revaluation of the VAS asset at 
the date of acquisition by the Group.
Capital investment of $4.0 million reflects investment in the 
Group’s oil and gas development and production assets 
during the year (2016: $13.9 million), primarily a continuation 
of the expenditure associated with the drilling of the MEX-109 
well. 
Under the agreement between the Group and NJSC Ukrnafta 
relating to the SV-2 well, which is a suspended well owned 
by NJSC Ukrnafta located within the Group’s SV licence 
area, the Group agreed to carry out a workover of the well 
and, if successful, to operate, produce and sell the gas 
and condensate from the well under an equal net profit-
sharing arrangement with NJSC Ukrnafta. The workover 
was successful and production from this well commenced in 
August 2017.
Cash and cash equivalents held at 31 December 2017 were 
$14.2 million and other short-term investments were $16.0 
million (31 December 2016: $20.0 million and nil respectively). 
The Group’s cash and cash equivalents balance at 28 March 
2018 was $20.3 million, held as $13.5 million equivalent in 
Ukrainian Hryvnia and the balance of $6.8 million equivalent 
predominantly in US Dollars and Pounds Sterling. The Group’s 
other short-term investments at 28 March 2018 were $16.0 
million.
Since early 2014, the Ukrainian Hryvnia has devalued 
significantly against the US Dollar, falling from UAH8.3/$1.00 
on 1 January 2014 to UAH28.1/$1.00 on 31 December 2017, 
which resulted in substantial foreign exchange translation 
losses for the Group over that period, and in turn adversely 
impacted the carrying value of the MEX-GOL and SV asset 
due to the translation of two of the Group’s subsidiaries from 
their functional currency of Ukrainian Hryvnia to the Group’s 
presentation currency of US Dollars. However in 2017, the 
exchange rate between the Ukrainian Hryvnia and the US 
Dollar has been reasonably stable averaging UAH26.6/$1.00 
during the period (average rate during 2016: UAH 27.0/$1.00). 
Nevertheless, further devaluation of the Ukrainian Hryvnia 
against the US Dollar may affect the carrying value of the 
Group’s assets in the future. 
Cash from operations has funded the capital investment 
during the period, and the Group’s current cash position and 
positive operating cash flow are the sources from which the 
Group plans to fund the development programmes for its 
assets in 2018.

The Group has a risk evaluation methodology in place to assist in the review of the risks across all material aspects of its business. 
This methodology highlights external, operational and technical, financial and corporate risks and assesses the level of risk and 
potential consequences. It is periodically presented to the Audit Committee and the Board for review, to bring to their attention 
potential risks and, where possible, propose mitigating actions. Key risks recognised and mitigation factors are detailed below:
RISK MITIGATION
External risks
Operating in Ukraine
Ukraine is an emerging market and as such the Group is 
exposed to greater regulatory, economic and political risks 
than it would be in other jurisdictions. Emerging economies 
are generally subject to a volatile political and economic 
environment, which makes them vulnerable to market 
downturns elsewhere in the world, and could adversely 
impact the Group’s ability to operate in the market. 
The Group minimises this risk by continuously monitoring 
the market in Ukraine and by maintaining a strong working 
relationship with the Ukrainian regulatory authorities. The 
Group also maintains a significant proportion of its cash 
holdings in international banks outside Ukraine. 
Regional conflict
Ukraine continues to have a strained relationship with Russia, 
following Ukraine’s agreement to join a free trade area with 
the European Union, which resulted in the implementation 
of mutual trade restrictions between Russia and Ukraine on 
many key products. Further, the conflict in parts of eastern 
Ukraine has not been resolved to date, and Russia continues 
to occupy Crimea. This conflict has put further pressure 
on relations between Ukraine and Russia, and the political 
tensions have had an adverse effect on the Ukrainian financial 
markets, hampering the ability of Ukrainian companies and 
banks to obtain funding from the international capital and 
debt markets. This strained relationship between Russia and 
Ukraine has also resulted in disputes and interruptions in the 
supply of gas from Russia.
As the Group has no assets in Crimea or the areas of conflict 
in the east of Ukraine, nor do its operations rely on sales or 
costs incurred there, the Group has not been directly affected 
by the conflict. However, the Group continues to monitor 
the situation and endeavours to procure its equipment from 
sources in other markets. The disputes and interruption to 
the supply of gas from Russia have indirectly encouraged 
Ukrainian Government support for the development of the 
domestic production of hydrocarbons since Ukraine imports 
a significant proportion of its gas, which has resulted in 
legislative measures to improve the regulatory requirements 
for hydrocarbon extraction in Ukraine.

PRINCIPAL RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES continued
RISK MITIGATION
Banking system in Ukraine
The banking system in Ukraine has been under great 
strain in recent years due to the weak level of capital, low 
asset quality caused by the economic situation, currency 
depreciation, changing regulations and other economic 
pressures generally, and so the risks associated with the 
banks in Ukraine have been significant, including in relation 
to the banks with which the Group has operated bank 
accounts. However, following remedial action imposed by 
the National Bank of Ukraine, Ukraine’s banking system has 
improved and at the end of May 2017, Moody’s revised its 
outlook for the Ukrainian banking system from negative to 
stable. Nevertheless, Ukraine continues to be supported 
by funding from the International Monetary Fund under a 
four-year Extended Funding Facility aggregating $17.5 billion 
approved in March 2015. Since then, Ukraine has received 
four tranches under the funding programme totalling $8.4 
billion, with the most recent tranche of $1 billion in April 
2017. Further disbursements of International Monetary 
Fund tranches depend on the implementation of Ukrainian 
Government reforms, and other economic, legal and political 
factors, including reforms to the banking system in Ukraine.
The creditworthiness and potential risks relating to the 
banks in Ukraine are regularly reviewed by the Group, but 
the geopolitical and economic events since 2013 in Ukraine 
have significantly weakened the Ukrainian banking sector. In 
light of this, the Group has taken and continues to take steps 
to diversify its banking arrangements between a number of 
banks in Ukraine. These measures are designed to spread 
the risks associated with each bank’s creditworthiness, 
and the Group endeavours to use banks that have the best 
available creditworthiness. Nevertheless, and despite some 
recent improvements, the Ukrainian banking sector remains 
weakly capitalised and so the risks associated with the 
banks in Ukraine remain significant, including in relation to 
the banks with which the Group operates bank accounts. 
As a consequence, the Group also maintains a significant 
proportion of its cash holdings in international banks outside 
Ukraine.
Geopolitical environment in Ukraine
Although there have been some improvements in recent 
years, there has not been a final resolution of the political, 
fiscal and economic situation in Ukraine and its ongoing 
effects are difficult to predict and likely to continue to affect 
the Ukrainian economy and potentially the Group’s business. 
Whilst not materially affecting the Group’s production 
operations, the instability has disrupted the Group’s 
development and operational planning for its assets. 
The Group continually monitors the market and business 
environment in Ukraine and endeavours to recognise 
approaching risks and factors that may affect its business. In 
addition, the involvement of Energees Management Limited, 
as a major shareholder with extensive experience in Ukraine, 
is considered helpful to mitigate such risks. 
Operational and technical risks
Health, Safety, Environment and Security (“HSES”)
The oil and gas industry, by its nature, conducts activities 
which can cause health, safety, environmental and security 
incidents. Serious incidents can not only have a financial 
impact but can also damage the Group’s reputation and the 
opportunity to undertake further projects. 
The Group maintains an HSES management system and 
requires that management, staff and contractors adhere 
to this system. The system ensures that the Group meets 
Ukraine legislative standards in full and achieves international 
standards to the maximum extent possible.

RISK MITIGATION
Oil and gas industry
The Group is exposed to risks which are generally associated 
with the oil and gas industry. For example, the Group’s 
ability to pursue and develop its projects and development 
programmes depends on a number of uncertainties, including 
the availability of capital, seasonal conditions, regulatory 
approvals, gas, oil, condensate and LPG prices, development 
costs and drilling success. As a result of these uncertainties, 
it is unknown whether potential drilling locations identified on 
proposed projects will ever be drilled or whether these or any 
other potential drilling locations will be able to produce gas, 
oil or condensate. In addition, drilling activities are subject to 
many risks, including the risk that commercially productive 
reservoirs will not be discovered. Drilling for hydrocarbons 
can be unprofitable, not only due to dry holes, but also as a 
result of productive wells that do not produce sufficiently to 
be economic. In addition, drilling and production operations 
are highly technical and complex activities and may be 
curtailed, delayed or cancelled as a result of a variety of 
factors. 
The Group has well qualified and experienced technical 
management staff to plan and supervise operational 
activities. In addition, the Group engages with suitably 
qualified local and international geological, geophysical 
and engineering experts and contractors to supplement 
and broaden the pool of expertise available to the Group. 
Detailed planning of development activities is undertaken 
with the aim of managing the inherent risks associated with 
oil and gas exploration and production, as well as ensuring 
that appropriate equipment and personnel are available for 
the operations, and that local contractors are appropriately 
supervised.
Production of hydrocarbons
Producing gas and condensate reservoirs are generally 
characterised by declining production rates which vary 
depending upon reservoir characteristics and other factors. 
Future production of the Group’s gas and condensate 
reserves, and therefore the Group’s cash flow and income, 
are highly dependent on the Group’s success in operating 
existing producing wells, drilling new production wells and 
efficiently developing and exploiting any reserves, as well as 
finding or acquiring additional reserves. The Group may not 
be able to develop, find or acquire reserves at acceptable 
costs. The experience gained from drilling undertaken to date 
highlights such risks as the Group targets the appraisal and 
production of these hydrocarbons. 
In 2016, the Group engaged external technical consultants to 
undertake a comprehensive review and re-evaluation study 
of the MEX-GOL and SV fields in order to gain an improved 
understanding of the geological aspects of the fields and 
reservoir engineering, drilling and completion techniques, and 
the results of this study and further planned technical work is 
being used by the Group in the future development of these 
fields. The Group has established an ongoing relationship 
with such external technical consultants to ensure that 
technical management and planning is of a high quality in 
respect of all development activities on the Group’s fields.

PRINCIPAL RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES continued
RISK MITIGATION
Development and operation of the Group’s fields in Ukraine
The planned development and operation of the Group’s gas 
and condensate fields in Ukraine is susceptible to appraisal, 
development and operational risk. This could include, but is 
not restricted to, delays in delivery of equipment in Ukraine, 
failure of key equipment, lower than expected production 
from wells that are currently producing, or new wells that 
are brought on-stream, problematic wells and complex 
geology which is difficult to drill or interpret. The generation of 
significant operational cash is dependent on the successful 
delivery and completion of the development and operation 
of the fields. These risks have been demonstrated by the 
previous downgrade in the Group’s remaining reserves which 
resulted in the reduction in the value in use, and consequent 
impairment loss relating to the Group’s MEX-GOL and SV 
asset in Ukraine. 
The Group’s technical management staff, in consultation with 
its external technical consultants, carefully plan and supervise 
development and operational activities with the aim of 
managing the risks associated with the further development 
of the Group’s fields in Ukraine. This includes detailed review 
and consideration of available subsurface data, utilisation of 
modern geological software, and utilisation of engineering 
and completion techniques developed for the fields. With 
operational activities, the Group ensures that appropriate 
equipment and personnel is available for the operations, and 
that operational contractors are appropriately supervised. 
In addition, the Group performs a review of its oil and gas 
assets for impairment on an annual basis, and considers 
whether an assessment of its oil and gas assets by a suitably 
qualified independent assessor is appropriate or required.
Drilling and workover operations
Due to the depth and nature of the reservoirs in the Group’s 
fields, the technical difficulty of drilling or re-entering wells 
in the Group’s fields is high, and this and the equipment 
limitations within Ukraine, can result in unsuccessful or lower 
than expected outcomes for wells.
The utilisation of detailed sub-surface analysis, careful 
well planning and engineering design in designing work 
programmes, along with appropriate procurement 
procedures and competent on-site management, aims to 
minimise these risks.
Maintenance of facilities
There is a risk that production or transportation facilities 
can fail due to non-adequate maintenance, control or poor 
performance of the Group’s suppliers. 
The Group’s facilities are operated and maintained at 
standards above the Ukraine minimum legal requirements. 
Operations staff are experienced and receive supplemental 
training to ensure that facilities are properly operated and 
maintained. Service providers are rigorously reviewed at the 
tender stage and are monitored during the contract period.
Financial risks
Restrictions on cash flow and liquidity
There is a risk that insufficient funds are available to meet 
the Group’s development obligations to commercialise the 
Group’s oil and gas assets. Since a significant proportion of 
the future capital requirements of the Group is expected to 
be derived from operational cash generated from production, 
including from wells yet to be drilled, there is a risk that in the 
longer term insufficient operational cash is generated, or that 
additional funding, should the need arise, cannot be secured. 
The Group maintains adequate cash reserves and closely 
monitors forecasted and actual cash flow, as well as short 
and longer-term funding requirements. The Group does 
not currently have any loans outstanding, internal financial 
projections are regularly made based on the latest estimates 
available, and various scenarios are run to assess the 
robustness of the liquidity of the Group. However, as the 
risk to future capital funding is inherent in the oil and gas 
exploration and development industry and reliant in part on 
future development success, it is difficult for the Group to 
take any other measures to further mitigate this risk, other 
than tailoring its development activities to its available capital 
funding from time to time.

RISK MITIGATION
Ensuring appropriate business practices
The Group operates in Ukraine, an emerging market, where 
certain inappropriate business practices may, from time to 
time occur, such as corrupt business practices, bribery, 
appropriation of property and fraud, all of which can lead to 
financial loss. 
The Group maintains anti-bribery and corruption policies 
in relation to all aspects of its business, and ensures that 
clear authority levels and robust approval processes are in 
place, with stringent controls over cash management and the 
tendering and procurement processes. In addition, office and 
site protection is maintained to protect the Group’s assets. 
Hydrocarbon prices
The Group derives its revenue principally from the sale of 
its Ukrainian gas, condensate and LPG production. These 
revenues are subject to commodity price volatility and 
political influence. A prolonged period of low gas, condensate 
and LPG prices may impact the Group’s ability to maintain its 
long-term investment programme with a consequent effect 
on growth rate, which in turn may impact the share price or 
any shareholder returns. Lower gas, condensate and LPG 
prices may not only decrease the Group’s revenues per 
unit, but may also reduce the amount of gas, condensate 
and LPG which the Group can produce economically, as 
would increases in costs associated with hydrocarbon 
production, such as subsoil taxes and royalties. The overall 
economics of the Group’s key assets (being the net present 
value of the future cash flows from its Ukrainian projects) are 
far more sensitive to long-term gas, condensate and LPG 
prices than short-term price volatility. However, short-term 
volatility does affect liquidity risk, as, in the early stage of the 
projects, income from production revenues is offset by capital 
investment.
The Group sells a proportion of its hydrocarbon production 
through long-term offtake arrangements, which include 
pricing formulae so as to ensure that it achieves market 
prices for its products, as well utilising the electronic market 
platforms in Ukraine to achieve market prices for its remaining 
products. However, hydrocarbon prices in Ukraine are 
implicitly linked to world hydrocarbon prices and so the 
Group is subject to external price trends.
Currency
Since the beginning of 2014, the Ukrainian Hryvnia has 
significantly devalued against major world currencies, 
including the US Dollar, where it has fallen from 
UAH8.3/$1.00 on 1 January 2014 to UAH28.1/$1.00 on 
31 December 2017, although it was relatively stable during 
2017. This devaluation was a significant contributor to the 
imposition of the banking restrictions by the National Bank 
of Ukraine over recent years. In addition, the geopolitical 
events in Ukraine over recent years, are likely to continue to 
impact the valuation of the Ukrainian Hryvnia against major 
world currencies. Further devaluation of the Ukrainian Hryvnia 
against the US Dollar will affect the carrying value of the 
Group’s assets. 
The Group’s sales proceeds are received in Ukrainian 
Hryvnia, and the majority of the capital expenditure costs 
for the current investment programme will be incurred in 
Ukrainian Hryvnia, thus the currency of revenue and costs 
are largely matched. In light of the previous devaluation 
and volatility of the Ukrainian Hryvnia against major world 
currencies, and since the Ukrainian Hryvnia does not benefit 
from the range of currency hedging instruments which are 
available in more developed economies, the Group has 
adopted a policy that, where possible, funds not required for 
use in Ukraine be retained on deposit in the United Kingdom, 
principally in US Dollars.

The challenging political and economic environment in 
Ukraine means that businesses can be subject to significant 
financial strain, which can mean that the Group is exposed to 
increased counterparty risk if counterparties fail or default in 
their contractual obligations to the Group, including in relation 
to the sale of its hydrocarbon production, resulting in financial 
loss to the Group.
The Group monitors the financial position and credit quality 
of its contractual counterparties and seeks to manage the 
risk associated with counterparties by contracting with 
creditworthy contractors and customers. Hydrocarbon 
production is sold on terms that limit supply credit and/or title 
transfer until payment is received.
Financial markets and economic outlook
The performance of the Group is influenced by global 
economic conditions and, in particular, the conditions 
prevailing in the United Kingdom and Ukraine. The economies 
in these regions have been subject to volatile pressures in 
recent periods, with the global economy having experienced 
a long period of difficulties, and more particularly the events 
that have occurred in Ukraine over recent years. This has led 
to extreme foreign exchange movements in the Ukrainian 
Hryvnia, high inflation and interest rates, and increased credit 
risk relating to the Group’s key counterparties. 
The Group’s sales proceeds are received in Ukrainian Hryvnia 
and a significant proportion of investment expenditure is 
made in Ukrainian Hryvnia, which minimises risks related to 
foreign exchange volatility. However, hydrocarbon prices in 
Ukraine are implicitly linked to world hydrocarbon prices and 
so the Group is subject to external price movements. The 
Group holds a significant proportion of its cash reserves in 
the United Kingdom, mostly in US Dollars, with reputable 
financial institutions. The financial status of counterparties 
is carefully monitored to manage counterparty risks. 
Nevertheless, the risks that the Group faces as a result 
of these risks cannot be predicted and many of these are 
outside of the Group’s control.
Corporate risks
Ukraine production licences
The Group operates in a region where the right to production 
can be challenged by State and non-State parties. During 
2010, this manifested itself in the form of a Ministry Order 
instructing the Group to suspend all operations and 
production from its MEX-GOL and SV production licences, 
which was not resolved until mid-2011. In 2013, new rules 
relating to the updating of production licences led to further 
challenges being raised by the Ukrainian authorities to 
the production licences held by independent oil and gas 
producers in Ukraine, including the Group, which may result 
in requirements for remediation work, financial penalties 
and/or the suspension of such licences, which, in turn, may 
adversely affect the Group’s operations and financial position. 
All such challenges affecting the Group have thus far been 
successfully defended through the Ukrainian legal system. 
However, the business environment is such that these 
types of challenges may arise at any time in relation to the 
Group’s operations, licence history, compliance with licence 
commitments and/or local regulations. In addition, these 
licences carry ongoing compliance obligations, which if not 
met, may lead to the loss of a licence.
The Group ensures compliance with commitments and 
regulations relating to its production licences through Group 
procedures and controls or, where this is not immediately 
feasible for practical or logistical considerations, seeks to 
enter into dialogue with the relevant Government bodies with 
a view to agreeing a reasonable time frame for achieving 
compliance or an alternative, mutually agreeable course of 
action. Work programmes are designed to ensure that all 
licence obligations are met and continual interaction with 
Government bodies is maintained in relation to licence 
obligations and commitments.

RISK MITIGATION
Extension of MEX-GOL and SV licences
The Group’s production licences for the MEX-GOL and SV 
fields currently expire in 2024. However, in the estimation 
of its reserves, it is assumed that licence extensions will be 
granted in accordance with current Ukrainian legislation and 
that consequently the fields’ development will continue until 
the end of the fields’ economic life in 2036. Despite such 
legislation, it is possible that licence extensions will not be 
granted, which would affect the achievement of full economic 
field development and consequently the carrying value of the 
Group’s MEX-GOL and SV asset in the future.
The Group monitors legislation in Ukraine which is likely to 
affect its licences and the obligations associated therewith, 
and ensures that its licence compliance obligations are 
monitored and maintained as such compliance is a likely to 
be a factor in the extension of the licences in 2024.
Key personnel
The Group’s success depends upon skilled management as 
well as technical expertise and administrative staff. The loss 
of service of critical members from the Group’s team could 
have an adverse effect on the business. 
The Group periodically reviews the compensation and 
contractual terms of its staff. In addition, the Group has 
developed relationships with a number of technical and other 
professional experts and advisers, who are used to provided 
specialist services as required.

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE STATEMENT
Companies on the AIM Market of London Stock Exchange plc 
are not required to comply with the UK Corporate Governance 
Code and due to its size the Company is not in full 
compliance. The Directors, however, support high standards 
of corporate governance. During 2018, the Company intends 
to adopt a corporate governance code, appropriate to its size 
and stature, to ensure compliance with the new requirement of 
the AIM Rules for Companies.
The Board
The Board of the Company consists of a Non-Executive 
Chairman, the Chief Executive Officer and four Non-Executive 
Directors. The Chief Executive Officer and two of the Non-
Executive Directors are nominees of Energees Management 
Limited, the majority shareholder of the Company. The 
composition of the Board ensures that no one individual or 
group dominates the decision-making process.
The Board is responsible to the shareholders for setting 
the direction of the Company through the establishment 
of strategic objectives and key policies. The Board meets 
regularly and considers issues of strategic direction, approves 
major capital expenditure, appoints and monitors senior 
management and any other matters having a material effect 
on the Company.
All Directors have access to management, including the 
Company Secretary, and to such information as is needed to 
carry out their duties and responsibilities fully and effectively.
Furthermore, all Directors are entitled to seek independent 
professional advice concerning the affairs of the Company, 
at its expense. All Directors are subject to election by 
shareholders at the first opportunity following their 
appointment. In addition, Directors will retire by rotation and 
stand for re-election by shareholders at least once every 
three years in accordance with the Company’s Articles of 
Association.
At the date of this report, no Directors have interests in the 
ordinary shares of the Company.

Financial Officer and a representative of the Independent 
Auditors.
The Audit Committee presently comprises Bruce Burrows

Board, it is appropriate to have a Nomination Committee. The 
appropriateness of such a committee will, however, be kept 
under regular review by the Company.
Internal Control
The Directors are responsible for the Group’s system of 
internal control and reviewing its effectiveness. Any such 
system is designed to manage rather than eliminate the risk 
of failure to achieve business objectives and can only provide 
reasonable and not absolute assurance against material 
misstatement or loss.
Internal controls were assessed for effectiveness and business 
risks were monitored and reviewed in the course of 2017 
through regular Board and management meetings.
Code of Conduct
The Group maintains an Anti-Bribery and Corruption Policy 
in relation to its compliance with the Bribery Act 2010, which

Group. The Board engages in discussions with shareholders 
as appropriate from time to time through formal meetings or

Directors’ Responsibilities Statement
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report 
and the financial statements in accordance with applicable law 
and regulations.
Company law requires the Directors to prepare financial 
statements for each financial year. Under that law the 
Directors have prepared the Group and Parent Company 
financial statements in accordance with International Financial 
Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European 
Union. Under company law the Directors must not approve 
the financial statements unless they are satisfied that they give 
a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Group and the 
Company and of the profit or loss of the Group for that period. 
In preparing these financial statements, the Directors are 
required to:
  select suitable accounting policies and then apply them 
consistently;
  make judgements and accounting estimates that are 
reasonable and prudent;
  state whether applicable IFRSs as adopted by the 
European Union have been followed, subject to any 
material departures disclosed and explained in the financial 
statements;
  prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis 
unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Company and 
the Group will continue in business.
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate 
accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain 
the Company’s transactions and disclose with reasonable 
accuracy at any time the financial position of the Company 
and the Group and enable them to ensure that the financial 
statements comply with the Companies Act 2006 as 
applicable to companies using IFRS. They are also responsible 
for safeguarding the assets of the Company and the Group 
and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and 
detection of fraud and other irregularities.
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity 
of the Company’s website. Legislation in the United Kingdom 
governing the preparation and dissemination of financial 
statements may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.
Each of the persons who is a Director at the date of approval 
of this report confirms that, to the best of their knowledge:
  the financial statements, prepared in accordance with 
IFRSs, as adopted by the European Union, give a true and 
fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and profit 
or loss of the Company and the undertakings included in 
the consolidation taken as a whole;
  the Strategic Report includes a fair review of the 
development and performance of the business and the 
position of the Company and the undertakings included 
in the consolidation taken as a whole, together with a 
description of the principal risks and uncertainties that they 
face; and
  the Annual Report and financial statements, taken as a 
whole, are fair, balanced and understandable and provide 
the information necessary for shareholders to assess the 
Company’s performance, business model and strategy.
Statement of Disclosure to Auditors
Each of the persons who is a Director at the date of approval 
of this Annual Report confirms that:
  so far as the Director is aware, there is no relevant audit 
information of which the Company’s Auditors are unaware; 
and
  the Director has taken all steps required to make himself 
aware of any relevant audit information and to establish that 
the Company’s Auditors are aware of that information.
This confirmation is given and should be interpreted in 
accordance with the provisions of section 418 of the 
Companies Act 2006.
Independent Auditors
A resolution to reappoint PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP as 
Independent Auditors will be proposed at the next Annual 
General Meeting.

REGAL PETROLEUM PLC  Annual Report and Financial Statements 2017
Report on the audit of the financial statements
Opinion
In our opinion, Regal Petroleum plc’s Group financial statements and Company financial statements (the “financial statements”):

profit and the Group’s and the Company’s cash flows for the year then ended;
  have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union and, as regards the Company’s 
financial statements, as applied in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006; and
  have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006.
We have audited the financial statements, included within the Annual Report and Financial Statements (the “Annual Report”), 
which comprise: the Group and Company balance sheets as at 31 December 2017; the Group income statement, the Group 
and Company statements of comprehensive income, the Group and Company statements of cash flows, and the Group and 
Company statements of changes in equity for the year then ended; and the notes to the financial statements, which include a 
description of the significant accounting policies.
Basis for opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK) (“ISAs (UK)”) and applicable law. Our 
responsibilities under ISAs (UK) are further described in the Auditors’ responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements 
section of our report. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our 
opinion.
Independence
We remained independent of the Group in accordance with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the financial 
statements in the UK, which includes the FRC’s Ethical Standard, as applicable to listed entities, and we have fulfilled our other 
ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements.

STRATEGIC REPORT FINANCIALS GOVERNANCE
The scope of our audit
As part of designing our audit, we determined materiality and assessed the risks of material misstatement in the financial 
statements. In particular, we looked at where the Directors made subjective judgements, for example in respect of significant 
accounting estimates that involved making assumptions and considering future events that are inherently uncertain. 
As in all of our audits, we also addressed the risk of management override of internal controls, including evaluating whether there 
was evidence of bias by the Directors that represented a risk of material misstatement due to fraud. 
Key audit matters
Key audit matters are those matters that, in the Auditors’ professional judgement, were of most significance in the audit of the 
financial statements of the current period and include the most significant assessed risks of material misstatement (whether 
or not due to fraud) identified by the Auditors, including those which had the greatest effect on: the overall audit strategy; the 
allocation of resources in the audit; and directing the efforts of the engagement team. These matters, and any comments we 
make on the results of our procedures thereon, were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a 
whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. This is not a complete 
list of all risks identified by our audit. 
KEY AUDIT MATTER HOW OUR AUDIT ADDRESSED THE KEY AUDIT MATTER
Carrying value of oil and gas assets (Group)
As disclosed in Notes 15 and 16, the Group has two cash 
generating units – MEX-GOL/SV and VAS. At 31 December 
2017, property, plant and equipment includes $14.3 million in 
respect of the MEX-GOL/SV and VAS cash generating units, 
and intangible assets includes mineral rights and reserves of 
$5.5 million in respect of the VAS cash generating unit.
We focused on this area due to the material nature of the 
balances and the judgement involved in assessing whether 
there were triggers that would suggest a full impairment 
review is required in accordance with IAS 36 ‘Impairment of 
assets’, or whether there were triggers that would suggest 
previously recognised impairments in the MEX-GOL/SV cash 
generating unit should be reversed.
After considering internal and external factors, including 
results from recent drilling activity, current production 
levels and the macroeconomic environment in Ukraine, 
management concluded that there were no impairment 
triggers in respect of either of the Group’s cash generating 
units. Specifically in connection with the MEX-GOL/SV cash 
generating unit, management also considered whether their 
trigger assessment suggested whether any of the previously 
recognised impairment should be reversed.
Management concluded that, while there were positive 
indicators that have arisen during 2017, there was insufficient 
information at 31 December 2017 to meet the impairment 
reversal requirements of IAS 36.
We reviewed the criteria outlined in IAS 36 and in particular 
considered changes in the key assumptions applied by 
management such as commodity prices and discount rates 
since the prior year. We also considered the status of the 
reserves updating process as outlined in Note 3(a).
We agree with management’s conclusion that no impairment 
trigger has arisen in respect of the oil and gas assets included 
within property, plant and equipment, and intangible assets. 
We also concur with their assessment that, while there are 
positive indicators, there is insufficient information on which to 
base a reversal of previously recognised impairment.

REGAL PETROLEUM PLC  Annual Report and Financial Statements 2017
KEY AUDIT MATTER HOW OUR AUDIT ADDRESSED THE KEY AUDIT MATTER
Carrying value of investments in subsidiaries (Company)
As disclosed in Note 17, the Company has a total investment 
in subsidiaries of $55.5 million comprising investment in 
shares and loans. The carrying value of the investment 
is dependent on the carrying value of oil and gas assets 
in the Company’s subsidiaries. Management considered 
whether there was any indication that the carrying value 
of investments was impaired, and whether there was any 
indication that previous impairments should be reversed, 
and concluded that there was reason to reverse a previously 
recognised impairment of $6,360,000.
We reviewed and challenged management’s assessment 
and considered it in the context of their review of the carrying 
value of oil and gas assets. We concur with management’s 
conclusion that no impairment is required and that the 
previously recognised impairment should be reversed.
How we tailored the audit scope
We tailored the scope of our audit to ensure that we performed enough work to be able to give an opinion on the financial 
statements as a whole, taking into account the structure of the Group and the Company, the accounting processes and 
controls, and the industry in which they operate.
The Group is structured as one operating segment, being oil and gas exploration, development and production in Ukraine. The 
Group financial statements are a consolidation of eight entities, comprising the Group’s operating businesses and centralised 
functions; however, our audit of the Group was scoped as one component.
Day-to-day management of the operations of the Group, including accounting and financial reporting, is undertaken in Kiev, 
Ukraine. Accordingly, a significant portion of our audit work was undertaken in Kiev.
Our audit gave us coverage of 100% of consolidated revenue and 99% of consolidated total assets. This, together with 
additional procedures performed at the Group level, gave us the evidence we needed for our opinion on the Group financial 
statements as a whole.
Materiality
The scope of our audit was influenced by our application of materiality. We set certain quantitative thresholds for materiality. 
These, together with qualitative considerations, helped us to determine the scope of our audit and the nature, timing and 
extent of our audit procedures on the individual financial statement line items and disclosures and in evaluating the effect of 
misstatements, both individually and in aggregate on the financial statements as a whole. 
Based on our professional judgement, we determined materiality for the financial statements as a whole as follows:
 GROUP FINANCIAL STATEMENTS COMPANY FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Overall materiality $350,500 (2016: $257,000). $669,000 (2016: $257,000).
How we determined it 1% of revenue. 5% of profit before tax.
Rationale for benchmark 
applied
Based on the benchmarks used in the 
Annual Report, revenue is the primary 
measure used by the shareholders in 
assessing the performance of the Group, 
and is a generally accepted auditing 
benchmark.
We believe that profit before tax is the 
primary measure used by the shareholders in 
assessing the performance of the Company, 
and is a generally accepted auditing 
benchmark.

STRATEGIC REPORT FINANCIALS GOVERNANCE
We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to them misstatements identified during our audit above $17,525 
(Group audit) (2016: $12,850) and $33,000 (Company audit) (2016: $12,750) as well as misstatements below those amounts 
that, in our view, warranted reporting for qualitative reasons.
Conclusions relating to going concern
We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters in relation to which ISAs (UK) require us to report to you when:
  the Directors’ use of the going concern basis of accounting in the preparation of the financial statements is not appropriate; or
  the Directors have not disclosed in the financial statements any identified material uncertainties that may cast significant doubt 
about the Group’s and Company’s ability to continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting for a period of at least 
12 months from the date when the financial statements are authorised for issue.
However, because not all future events or conditions can be predicted, this statement is not a guarantee as to the Group’s and 
Company’s ability to continue as a going concern.
Reporting on other information 
The other information comprises all of the information in the Annual Report other than the financial statements and our Auditors’ 
Report thereon. The Directors are responsible for the other information. Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover 
the other information and, accordingly, we do not express an audit opinion or, except to the extent otherwise explicitly stated in 
this report, any form of assurance thereon. 
In connection with our audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, 
consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the 
audit, or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If we identify an apparent material inconsistency or material misstatement, 
we are required to perform procedures to conclude whether there is a material misstatement of the financial statements 
or a material misstatement of the other information. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a 
material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report based on these 
responsibilities.
With respect to the Strategic Report and Directors’ Report, we also considered whether the disclosures required by the UK 
Companies Act 2006 have been included. 
Based on the responsibilities described above and our work undertaken in the course of the audit, ISAs (UK) require us also to 
report certain opinions and matters as described below.
Strategic Report and Directors’ Report
In our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of the audit, the information given in the Strategic Report and 
Directors’ Report for the year ended 31 December 2017 is consistent with the financial statements and has been prepared in 
accordance with applicable legal requirements. 
In light of the knowledge and understanding of the Group and Company and their environment obtained in the course of the 
audit, we did not identify any material misstatements in the Strategic Report and Directors’ Report.

REGAL PETROLEUM PLC  Annual Report and Financial Statements 2017
Responsibilities for the financial statements and the audit
Responsibilities of the Directors for the financial statements
As explained more fully in the Directors’ Responsibilities Statement, the Directors are responsible for the preparation of the 
financial statements in accordance with the applicable framework and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view. The 
Directors are also responsible for such internal control as they determine is necessary to enable the preparation of financial 
statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
In preparing the financial statements, the Directors are responsible for assessing the Group’s and the Company’s ability to 
continue as a going concern, disclosing as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of 
accounting unless the Directors either intend to liquidate the Group or the Company or to cease operations, or have no realistic 
alternative but to do so.
Auditors’ responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material 
misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an Auditors’ Report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance 
is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs (UK) will always detect a 
material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or 
in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these 
financial statements. 
A further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements is located on the FRC’s website at: www.frc.
org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities. This description forms part of our Auditors’ Report.
Use of this report
This report, including the opinions, has been prepared for and only for the Company’s members as a body in accordance with 
Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006 and for no other purpose. We do not, in giving these opinions, accept or 
assume responsibility for any other purpose or to any other person to whom this report is shown or into whose hands it may 
come save where expressly agreed by our prior consent in writing.

Other required reporting
Companies Act 2006 exception reporting
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if, in our opinion:
  we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit; or
  adequate accounting records have not been kept by the Company, or returns adequate for our audit have not been received 
from branches not visited by us; or
  certain disclosures of Directors’ remuneration specified by law are not made; or
  the Company financial statements are not in agreement with the accounting records and returns. 
We have no exceptions to report arising from this responsibility.

NOTES 
forming part of the financial statements
1. General Information and Operational Environment
Regal Petroleum plc (the “Company”) and its subsidiaries (the “Group”) is a gas, condensate and LPG production group. 
The Company is a company quoted on the AIM Market of London Stock Exchange plc and incorporated in England and Wales 
under the Companies Act 2006. The Company’s registered office is at 16 Old Queen Street, London, SW1H 9HP , United 
Kingdom and its registered number is 4462555. The principal activities of the Group and the nature of the Group’s operations 
are set out in the Directors’ Report. 
As of 31 December 2017 and 2016, the Company’s immediate parent company was Energees Management Limited, which  
is 100% owned by Pelidona Services Limited, which is 100% owned by Lovitia Investments Ltd, which is 100% owned by  
Mr V Novinskiy. Accordingly, the Company was ultimately controlled by Mr V Novinskiy.
The Group’s gas, condensate and LPG extraction and production facilities are located in Ukraine. The ongoing political and 
economic instability in Ukraine, which commenced in late 2013, has led to a deterioration of Ukrainian State finances, volatility of 
financial markets, illiquidity on capital markets, higher inflation and a depreciation of the national currency against major foreign 
currencies and has continued in 2017, though to a lesser extent as compared to 2014–2016.
The inflation rate in Ukraine during 2017 increased to 14% (as compared to 12% in 2016).
Devaluation of the Ukrainian Hryvnia during 2017 has been moderate. As at 29 March 2018, the official exchange rate of  
the Ukrainian Hryvnia against the US Dollar was UAH26.4/$1.00, compared to UAH28.1/$1.00 as at 31 December 2017  
(31 December 2016: UAH27.2/$1.00). 
In 2017, there was a further easing of the currency control restrictions that were introduced by the National Bank of Ukraine 
during 2014–2015. In particular, the required share of foreign currency for mandatory sale was decreased from 65% to 50% 
from 4 April 2017, and the settlement period for export–import transactions in foreign currency was increased from 120 to 180 
days from 26 May 2017. In addition, from 13 June 2016, Ukrainian companies were permitted to pay dividends to non-residents 
with a limit of $5 million per month. 
Further details of risks relating to Ukraine can be found within the Principal Risks and Uncertainties section of the Strategic 
Report.
2. Accounting Policies
The principal accounting policies applied in the preparation of these consolidated financial statements are set out below. These 
policies have been consistently applied to all the years presented, unless otherwise stated.
Basis of Preparation 
The Group has prepared its consolidated financial statements under International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRSs”) and 
interpretations issued by the IFRS Interpretations Committee (“IFRS IC”), as adopted by the European Union. The financial 
statements have been prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 2006 as applicable to companies using IFRS. 
The financial statements are prepared on the historical cost basis as modified by the initial recognition of subsidiary acquisition 
and financial instruments based on fair value.
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires the use of certain critical accounting estimates. It also 
requires management to exercise its judgement in the process of applying the Group’s accounting policies. The areas involving 
a higher degree of judgement or complexity, or areas where assumptions and estimates are significant to the consolidated 
financial statements are disclosed in Note 3.

2. Accounting Policies continued
Going Concern
Based on the positive operational and financial performance of the Group and for the reasons outlined in the Principal Risks 
and Uncertainties section of the Strategic Report, the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group has adequate 
resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future regarded as at least 12 months after the date of signing 
of these financial statements. Accordingly, the going concern basis has been adopted in preparing its consolidated financial 
statements for the year ended 31 December 2017. The use of this basis of accounting takes into consideration the Company’s 
and the Group’s current and forecast financing position, additional details of which are provided in the Principal Risks and 
Uncertainties section of the Strategic Report. 
New and amended standards adopted by the Group
The Group has applied the following new and revised standards and interpretations for the first time for its annual reporting 
period commencing 1 January 2017. These improvements relate to the following areas: 
  Amendment to IAS 12, ‘Income taxes’, regarding recognition of deferred tax assets for unrealised losses 
  Amendment to IAS 7, ‘Cash flow statements’, regarding the Disclosure initiative
  Annual improvements 2014–2016 IFRS 12, ‘Disclosure of interests in other entities’
The adoption of these amendments had no significant impact on these financial statements.
Impact of standards issued but not yet applied by the Group
Certain new accounting standards and interpretations have been published that are not mandatory for 2017 reporting 
periods and have not been early adopted by the Group. The Group’s assessment of the impact of these new standards and 
interpretations is set out below: 
  IFRS 9, ‘Financial instruments’, addresses the classification, measurement and recognition of financial assets and financial 
liabilities. The complete version of IFRS 9 was issued in July 2014. It replaces the guidance in IAS 39 that relates to the 
classification and measurement of financial instruments. IFRS 9 retains but simplifies the mixed measurement model and 
establishes three primary measurement categories for financial assets: amortised cost, fair value through other comprehensive 
income (“OCI”) and fair value through profit and loss. The basis of classification depends on the entity’s business model 
and the contractual cash flow characteristics of the financial asset. Investments in equity instruments are required to be 
measured at fair value through profit or loss with the irrevocable option at inception to present changes in fair value in OCI 
not recycling. There is now a new expected credit losses model that replaces the incurred loss impairment model used in 
IAS 39. For financial liabilities there were no changes to classification and measurement except for the recognition of changes 
in own credit risk in OCI, for liabilities designated at fair value through profit or loss. IFRS 9 relaxes the requirements for 
hedge effectiveness by replacing the bright line hedge effectiveness tests. It requires an economic relationship between the 
hedged item and hedging instrument and for the ‘hedged ratio’ to be the same as the one management actually use for risk 
management purposes. Contemporaneous documentation is still required but is different to that currently prepared under 
IAS 39. 
The Group has decided not to adopt IFRS 9 until it becomes mandatory on 1 January 2018. The Group does not expect the 
new guidance to have a significant impact on the classification and measurement of its financial assets and liabilities.

The new standard also introduces expanded disclosure requirements and changes in presentation. Management of the Group 
does not expect a significant impact on its consolidated financial statements effected by implementation of IFRS 9 on 1 January 
2018.
  IFRS 15, ‘Revenue from contracts with customers’ , deals with revenue recognition and establishes principles for reporting 
useful information to users of financial statements about the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash 
flows arising from an entity’s contracts with customers. Revenue is recognised when a customer obtains control of a good or 
service and thus has the ability to direct the use and obtain the benefits from the good or service. The standard replaces IAS 
18 ‘Revenue’ and IAS 11 ‘Construction contracts’ and related interpretations. The standard is effective for first interim periods 
within annual reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018. The Group will adopt the new standard from 1 January 
2018. The Group does not expect the new standard to have a significant impact on financial statements of the Group.

  IFRS 16, ‘Leases’, was issued in January 2016. It will result in almost all leases being recognised on the balance sheet, as the 
distinction between operating and finance leases is removed. Under the new standard, an asset (the right to use the leased 
item) and a financial liability to pay rentals are recognised. The only exceptions are short-term and low-value leases. The 
accounting for lessors will not significantly change. The standard will affect primarily the accounting for the Group’s operating 
leases. As at the reporting date, the Group has non-cancellable operating lease commitments of $103,000. However, the 
Group has not yet determined to what extent these commitments will result in the recognition of an asset and a liability for 
future payments and how this will affect the Group’s profit and classification of cash flows. Some of the commitments may 
be covered by the exception for short-term and low-value leases and some commitments may relate to arrangements that 
will not qualify as leases under IFRS 16. The standard is mandatory for first interim periods within annual reporting periods 
beginning on or after 1 January 2019. At this stage, the Group does not intend to adopt the standard before its effective date. 
The Group is currently assessing the impact of the new standard on its consolidated financial statements.
There are no other IFRSs or IFRIC interpretations that are not yet effective that would be expected to have a material impact on 
the Group in the current or future reporting periods and on foreseeable future transactions.
Exchange differences on intra-group balances with foreign operation 
The Group has certain inter-company monetary balances of which the Company is the beneficial owner. These monetary 
balances are payable by a subsidiary that is a foreign operation and are eliminated on consolidation. 
In the consolidated financial statements, exchange differences arising on such payables because the transaction currency 
differs from the subsidiary’s functional currency are recognised initially in other comprehensive income if the settlement of such 
payables is continuously deferred and is neither planned nor likely to occur in the foreseeable future. 
In such cases, the respective receivables of the Company are regarded as an extension of the Company’s net investment in that 
foreign operation, and the cumulative amount of the above-mentioned exchange differences recognised in other comprehensive 
income is carried forward within the foreign exchange reserve in equity and is reclassified to profit or loss only upon disposal of 
the foreign operation. 
When the subsidiary that is a foreign operation settles its quasi-equity liability due to the Company, but the Company continues 
to possess the same percentage of the subsidiary, i.e. there has been no change in its proportionate ownership interest, such 
settlement is not regarded as a disposal or a partial disposal, and therefore cumulative exchange differences are not reclassified. 
The designation of inter-company monetary balances as part of the net investment in a foreign operation is reassessed when 
management’s expectations and intentions on settlement change due to a change in circumstances. 
Where, because of a change in circumstances, a receivable balance, or part thereof, previously designated as a net investment 
into a foreign operation is intended to be settled, the receivable is de-designated and is no longer regarded as part of the net 
investment. 
In such cases, the exchange differences arising on the subsidiary’s payable following de-designation are recognised within 
finance costs/income in profit or loss, similar to foreign exchange differences arising from financing.
Basis of Consolidation 
The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial information of the Company and entities controlled by the 
Company (and its subsidiaries) made up to 31 December each year.

2. Accounting Policies continued
Subsidiaries
Subsidiaries are all entities (including structured entities) over which the Group has control. The Group controls an entity when 
the Group is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those 
returns through its power over the entity. Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the 
Group. They are deconsolidated from the date that control ceases.
The Group applies the acquisition method to account for business combinations. The consideration transferred for the 
acquisition of a subsidiary is the fair value of the assets transferred, the liabilities incurred to the former owners of the acquiree 
and the equity interests issued by the Group. The consideration transferred includes the fair value of any asset or liability 
resulting from a contingent consideration arrangement. Identifiable assets acquired and liabilities and contingent liabilities 
assumed in a business combination are measured initially at their fair values at the acquisition date. The Group recognises any 
non-controlling interest in the acquiree on an acquisition-by-acquisition basis at the non-controlling interest’s proportionate share 
of the recognised amounts of the acquiree’s identifiable net assets. 
Acquisition-related costs are expensed as incurred.
If the business combination is achieved in stages, the acquisition date carrying value of the acquirer’s previously held equity 
interest in the acquiree is remeasured to fair value at the acquisition date; any gains or losses arising from such remeasurement 
are recognised in profit or loss.
Any contingent consideration to be transferred by the Group is recognised at fair value at the acquisition date. Subsequent 
changes to the fair value of the contingent consideration that is deemed to be an asset or liability is recognised in accordance 
with IAS 39 either in profit or loss or as a change to other comprehensive income. Contingent consideration that is classified as 
equity is not remeasured, and its subsequent settlement is accounted for within equity.
Inter-company transactions, balances and unrealised gains on transactions between Group companies are eliminated. 
Unrealised losses are also eliminated. When necessary, amounts reported by subsidiaries have been adjusted to conform with 
the Group’s accounting policies.
Segment reporting
The Group’s only class of business activity is oil and gas exploration, development and production. The Group’s primary 
operations are located in Ukraine, with its head office in the United Kingdom. The geographical segments are the basis on which 
the Group reports its segment information to management. Operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the 
internal reporting provided to the Board of Directors. 
Commercial Reserves
Proved and probable oil and gas reserves are estimated quantities of commercially producible hydrocarbons which the existing 
geological, geophysical and engineering data show to be recoverable in future years from known reservoirs. The proved and 
probable reserves conform to the definition approved by the Petroleum Resources Management System.
Oil and Gas Development and Producing Assets 
The Group applies the successful efforts method of accounting for oil and gas assets, having regard to the requirements of  
IFRS 6 “Exploration for and Evaluation of Mineral Resources”. 
All licence acquisition, exploration and evaluation costs are initially capitalised as intangible assets in cost centres by field 
or by exploration area, as appropriate, pending determination of commerciality of the relevant property. Directly attributable 
administration costs are capitalised insofar as they relate to specific exploration activities, as are finance costs to the extent they 
are directly attributable to financing development projects. Pre-licence costs and general exploration costs not specific to any 
particular licence or prospect are expensed as incurred.
If prospects are deemed to be impaired (“unsuccessful”) on completion of the evaluation, the associated costs are charged to 
the Income Statement. If the field is determined to be commercially viable, the attributable costs are transferred to development/
producing assets within property, plant and equipment in single field cost centres.

2. Accounting Policies continued
Subsequent expenditure is capitalised only where it either enhances the economic benefits of the development/producing asset 
or replaces part of the existing development/producing asset. 
Net proceeds from any disposal of an exploration asset are initially credited against the previously capitalised costs. Any surplus 
proceeds are credited to the Income Statement. Net proceeds from any disposal of development/producing assets are credited 
against the previously capitalised cost. Gains and losses on disposals of development/producing assets are determined by 
comparing proceeds from sale with the appropriate portion of the net capitalised costs of the asset and are recognised in the 
Income Statement for the year.
Depreciation, Depletion and Amortisation
All expenditure carried within each field is amortised from the commencement of commercial production on a unit of production 
basis, which is the ratio of gas production in the period to the estimated quantities of commercial reserves at the end of the 
period plus the production in the period, generally on a field by field basis. In certain circumstances, fields within a single 
development area may be combined for depletion purposes. Costs used in the unit of production calculation comprise the 
net book value of capitalised costs plus the estimated future field development costs necessary to bring the reserves into 
production.
Impairment
At each balance sheet date, the Group reviews the carrying amount of development and producing assets to determine 
whether there is any indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss. This includes exploration and appraisal costs 
capitalised which are assessed for impairment in accordance with IFRS 6. If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount 
of the asset is estimated in order to determine the extent of the impairment loss. 
For development/producing assets, the recoverable amount is the greater of fair value less costs to dispose and value in use. 
In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using an expected weighted 
average cost of capital. If the recoverable amount of an asset is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying 
amount of the asset is reduced to its recoverable amount. Impairment losses are recognised as an expense immediately. 
Should an impairment loss subsequently reverse, the carrying amount of the asset is increased to the revised estimate of its 
recoverable amount, but so that the increased carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been 
determined had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset in prior years. A reversal of an impairment loss is recognised 
as income immediately.
Decommissioning Provision
Where a material liability for the removal of existing production facilities and site restoration at the end of the productive life of 
a field exists, a provision for decommissioning is recognised. The amount recognised is the present value of estimated future 
expenditure determined in accordance with local conditions and requirements. The cost of the relevant property, plant and 
equipment is increased with an amount equivalent to the provision and depreciated on a unit of production basis. Changes in 
estimates are recognised prospectively, with corresponding adjustments to the provision and the associated fixed asset. The 
unwinding of the discount on the decommissioning provision is included within finance costs. 
Property, Plant and Equipment other than Oil and Gas Assets 
Property, plant and equipment other than oil and gas assets are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and any provision 
for impairment. Depreciation is charged so as to write off the cost of assets on a straight-line basis over their useful lives as 
follows: 
Useful lives in years
Buildings and constructions 10 to 20 years
Machinery and equipment 2 to 5 years
Vehicles 5 years
Office and other equipment 4 to 12 years
Spare parts and equipment purchased with the intention to be used in future capital investment projects are recognised as 
development and production assets within property, plant and equipment.

2. Accounting Policies continued
Inventories 
Inventories typically consist of materials, spare parts and hydrocarbons, and are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable 
value. Cost of finished goods is determined on the weighted average bases. Cost of other than finished goods inventory is 
determined on the first in, first out basis. Net realisable value represents the estimated selling price less all estimated costs of 
completion and costs to be incurred in marketing, selling and distribution. 
Revenue Recognition 
Revenue from sale of goods represents amounts invoiced in respect of sales of gas, condensate and LPG exclusive of indirect 
taxes and excise duties and is recognised at the point of transfer of risks and rewards of ownership of the goods, normally when 
the goods are shipped. To the extent that revenue arises from test production during an evaluation programme, an amount is 
charged from intangible exploration assets to cost of sales so as to reflect a zero net margin. 
Interest income is accrued on a time basis, by reference to the principal outstanding and at the effective rate applicable, which 
is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash receipts through the expected life of the financial asset to that asset’s net 
carrying amount. 
Foreign Currencies
The Group’s consolidated financial statements and those of the Company are presented in US Dollars. The functional currency 
of the subsidiaries which operate in Ukraine is Ukrainian Hryvnia. The remaining entities have US Dollars as their functional 
currency.
The functional currency of individual companies is determined by the primary economic environment in which the entity 
operates, normally the one in which it primarily generates and expends cash. In preparing the financial statements of the 
individual companies, transactions in currencies other than the entity’s functional currency (“foreign currencies”) are recorded at 
the rates of exchange prevailing on the dates of the transactions. At each balance sheet date, monetary assets and liabilities that 
are denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rates prevailing on the balance sheet date. Foreign exchange gains 
and losses resulting from the settlement of such transactions and from the translation at year-end exchange rates of monetary 
assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are recognised in the Income Statement. Non-monetary assets and 
liabilities carried at fair value that are denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the rates prevailing at the date when 
the fair value was determined. Non-monetary items which are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are 
not retranslated. Gains and losses arising on retranslation are included in net profit or loss for the period, except for exchange 
differences arising on balances which are considered long-term investments where the changes in fair value are recognised 
directly in other comprehensive income. 
On consolidation, the assets and liabilities of the Group’s subsidiaries which do not use US Dollars as their functional currency 
are translated into US Dollars as follows:
(a) assets and liabilities for each Balance Sheet presented are translated at the closing rate at the date of that Balance Sheet;
(b) income and expenses for each Income Statement are translated at average monthly exchange rates (unless this average 
is not a reasonable approximation of the cumulative effect of the rates prevailing on the transaction dates, in which case 
income and expenses are translated at the rate on the dates of the transactions); and
(c) all resulting exchange differences are recognised in other comprehensive income.
The principal rates of exchange used for translating foreign currency balances at 31 December 2017 were $1:UAH28.1 (2016: 
$1:UAH27.2), $1:£0.7 (2016: $1:£0.8), $1:€0.8 (2016: $1:€0.9).
None of the Group’s operations are considered to use the currency of a hyperinflationary economy; however, this is kept under 
review.

2. Accounting Policies continued
Pensions
The Group contributes to a local government pension scheme in Ukraine and defined benefit plans. The Group has no further 
payment obligations towards the local government pension scheme once the contributions have been paid.
Defined benefit plans define an amount of pension benefit that an employee will receive on retirement, usually dependent on one 
or more factors such as age, years of service and compensation. 
The Group companies participate in a mandatory Ukrainian State-defined retirement benefit plan, which provides for early 
pension benefits for employees working in certain workplaces with hazardous and unhealthy working conditions. The Group also 
provides lump sum benefits upon retirement subject to certain conditions. The early pension benefit (in the form of a monthly 
annuity) is payable by employers only until the employee has reached the statutory retirement age. The pension scheme is based 
on a benefit formula which depends on each individual member’s average salary, his/her total length of past service and total 
length of past service at specific types of workplaces (“list II” category).
The liability recognised in the Balance Sheet in respect of defined benefit pension plans is the present value of the defined 
benefit obligation at the end of the reporting period less the fair value of plan assets. The defined benefit obligation is calculated 
annually by independent actuaries using the projected unit credit method. The present value of the defined benefit obligation 
is determined by discounting the estimated future cash outflows using interest rates of high-quality corporate bonds that are 
denominated in the currency in which the benefits will be paid, and that have terms to maturity approximating to the terms of the 
related pension obligation. Since Ukraine has no deep market in such bonds, the market rates on government bonds are used.
The current service cost of the defined benefit plan, recognised in the Income Statement in employee benefit expense, except 
where included in the cost of an asset, reflects the increase in the defined benefit obligation resulting from employee service in 
the current year, benefit changes curtailments and settlements. Past-service costs are recognised immediately in the Income 
Statement.
The net interest cost is calculated by applying the discount rate to the net balance of the defined benefit obligation and the fair 
value of plan assets. This cost is included in employee benefit expense in the Income Statement.
Actuarial gains and losses arising from experience adjustments and changes in actuarial assumptions are charged or credited to 
equity in other comprehensive income in the period in which they arise.
In October 2017, there were certain changes introduced to the Law of Ukraine on Mandatory State Pension Insurance as follows:
  Increase in retirement age and required employment period which resulted in an increase of preferential pensions period 
covered by the Group and consequently past service costs; 
  Decrease of index used in the calculation of insurance period which subsequently led to a decrease of pensions amount; 
  The Government of Ukraine deblocked pensions indexation starting from 2019 which is now estimated as 50% of salary 
increase and 50% of inflation.
Leases 
Leases are classified as finance leases whenever the terms of the lease transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of 
ownership to the lessee. All other leases are classified as operating leases. 
Rentals payable/receivable under operating leases are charged/credited to the Income Statement on a straight-line basis over 
the term of the relevant lease. Benefits received or given as an incentive to enter into an operating lease are also spread on a 
straight-line basis over the lease term.

2. Accounting Policies continued
Taxation 
The tax expense represents the sum of the current tax and deferred tax. 
Current tax, including UK corporation and overseas tax, is provided at amounts expected to be paid (or recovered) using the tax 
rates and laws that have been enacted or substantially enacted by the Balance Sheet date. 
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and 
liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit, and is accounted 
for using the balance sheet liability method. Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences 
and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which 
deductible temporary differences can be utilised. Such assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary difference arises 
from goodwill or from the initial recognition (other than in a business combination) of other assets and liabilities in a transaction 
that affects neither the tax profit nor the accounting profit. 
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries and associates, and 
interests in joint ventures, except where the Group is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable 
that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future. 
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates which are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset 
is realised. Deferred tax is charged or credited in the Income Statement, except when it relates to items charged or credited 
directly to equity, in which case the deferred tax is also dealt with in equity. 
Other taxes which include recoverable value added tax, sales tax and custom duties represent the amounts receivable or 
payable to local tax authorities in the countries where the Group operates.
Financial Instruments 
Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised on the Group’s Balance Sheet when the Group becomes a party to the 
contractual provisions of the instrument. 
The Group classifies its financial assets as loans and receivables. The classification depends on the purpose for which the 
financial assets were acquired. Management determines the classification of its financial assets at initial recognition.
The Group does not currently utilise derivative financial instruments.
Trade Receivables 
Trade receivables are amounts due from customers for goods sold in the ordinary course of business. If collection is expected in 
one year or less, they are classified as current assets. If not, they are presented as non-current assets.
Trade receivables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest 
method, less provision for impairment.
The Group assesses at the end of each reporting period whether there is objective evidence that a financial asset or group of 
financial assets is impaired. A financial asset or a group of financial assets is impaired and impairment losses are incurred only if 
there is objective evidence of impairment as a result of one or more events that occurred after the initial recognition of the asset 
(a “loss event”) and that loss event (or events) has an impact on the estimated future cash flows of the financial asset or group of 
financial assets that can be reliably estimated.
For the financial assets carried at amortised cost the evidence of impairment may include indications that the debtors or a group 
of debtors is experiencing significant financial difficulty, default or delinquency in interest or principal payments, the probability 
that they will enter bankruptcy or other financial reorganisation, and where observable data indicate that there is a measurable 
decrease in the estimated future cash flows, such as changes in arrears or economic conditions that correlate with defaults.
For loans and receivables category, the amount of the loss is measured as the difference between the asset’s carrying amount 
and the present value of estimated future cash flows (excluding future credit losses that have not been incurred) discounted at 
the financial asset’s original effective interest rate. The carrying amount of the asset is reduced and the amount of the loss is 
recognised in the consolidated Income Statement.

2. Accounting Policies continued
If, in a subsequent period, the amount of the impairment loss decreases and the decrease can be related objectively to an 
event occurring after the impairment was recognised (such as an improvement in the debtor’s credit rating), the reversal of the 
previously recognised impairment loss is recognised in the consolidated Income Statement.
Investments and loans to subsidiaries
Investments in subsidiaries and loans issued to subsidiaries for subsequent finance of the business are stated at cost and 
reviewed for impairment if there are indications that the carrying value may not be recoverable.
Trade Payables 
Trade payables are obligations to pay for goods or services that have been acquired in the ordinary course of business from 
suppliers. Accounts payable are classified as current liabilities if payment is due within one year or less. If not, they are presented 
as non-current liabilities. 
Trade payables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest 
method.
Equity Instruments
Ordinary shares are classified as equity. Equity instruments issued by the Company and the Group are recorded at the proceeds 
received, net of direct issue costs. Any excess of the fair value of consideration received over the par value of shares issued is 
recorded as share premium in equity.
Cash and Cash Equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash on hand and deposits held at call with banks and other short-term highly liquid 
investments which are readily convertible to a known amount of cash with no significant loss of interest.
Other short-term investments
Other short-term investments include current accounts and deposits held at banks, which do not meet cash and cash 
equivalents definition. Other short-term investments are measured initially at fair value and subsequently carried at amortised 
cost using the effective interest method. Interest received on other short-term investments is disclosed within operating 
cash flow. 
3. Critical Accounting Estimates and Assumptions
The Group makes estimates and assumptions concerning the future. The resulting accounting estimates will, by definition, 
seldom equal the related actual results. The estimates and assumptions which have a risk of causing material adjustment to the 
carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year are discussed below.
(a) Recoverability of Development and Production Assets in Ukraine
According to the Group’s accounting policies, costs capitalised as assets are assessed for impairment at each balance sheet 
date if impairment indicators exist. In assessing whether an impairment loss has occurred, the carrying value of the asset is 
compared to its recoverable amount. In previous years, management had assessed value in use, using a discounted cash flow 
model to measure its recoverable amount. The cash flows in the model were projected in real terms, i.e. they did not take into 
account the impact on cash flows of the estimated commodity price index during the period of projection. The discount rate 
was adjusted accordingly and represented a real terms discount rate. No impairment loss was recognised as a result of the 
assessment as at 31 December 2016. In the current year, no impairment indicators were identified, due to a favourable change 
in the Group’s performance and the economic environment in Ukraine and, therefore, no impairment test was required. In 
addition, the Group considered if there were any triggers to reverse any previously recognised impairment and concluded that 
there was insufficient information to be able to do so. The Group is currently undertaking certain projects with the purpose of 
refining its field development strategy, including the required capital expenditure, and the reassessment of its mineral reserves. 
The information that will be obtained from these projects is expected to enable the Group to determine the need for any 
reassessment of the carrying value of its oil and gas assets.

3. Critical Accounting Estimates and Assumptions continued
(b) Recoverability of inter-company loans receivable by the Company from a subsidiary
The Company has certain inter-company loans receivable from a subsidiary, which are eliminated on consolidation. For the 
purpose of the Company’s financial statements, these receivable balances are impaired if the present value of estimated future 
cash flows (excluding future credit losses that have not been incurred) discounted at the original effective interest rate is less 
than the asset’s carrying amount, and the resulting impairment loss is recognised in profit or loss in the Company’s financial 
statements. In previous years, impairment charges were recognised against the cumulative balance of the loans issued to 
subsidiaries based on an analysis of their recoverability. During 2017, the Company received $12,450,000 in repayment of loans 
receivable from its subsidiaries, including $6,360,000 of interest accrued, which had been impaired in the prior year. In light of 
this repayment, the provision related to the interest was reversed in the amount repaid. In addition, the Company considered 
if there were any triggers to reverse any additional previously recognised impairment and concluded that there was insufficient 
information to be able to do so. The Group is currently undertaking certain projects with the purpose of refining its field 
development strategy, including the required capital expenditure, and the reassessment of its mineral reserves. The information 
that will be obtained from these projects is expected to enable the Company to determine the need for any reassessment of the 
carrying value of its inter-company loans.
(c) Decommissioning
The Group has decommissioning obligations in respect of its Ukrainian assets. The full extent to which the provision is required 
depends on the legal requirements at the time of decommissioning, the costs and timing of any decommissioning works and the 
discount rate applied to such costs. 
A detailed assessment of gross decommissioning cost was undertaken on a well-by-well basis using local data on day 
rates and equipment costs. The discount rate applied on the decommissioning cost provision at 31 December 2017 was 
4.7% (31 December 2016: 6.11%). The discount rate is calculated in real terms based on the yield to maturity of Ukrainian 
Government bonds denominated in the currency in which the liability is expected to be settled and with the settlement date that 
approximates the timing of settlement of decommissioning obligations.
The change in estimate during 2017 reflects a combination of a revision in the estimated costs (increase of $559,000) and the 
discount rate applied (increase of $421,000). 
The decommissioning costs are estimated to be incurred by June 2036 on the MEX-GOL and SV gas and condensate fields, 
which is the current estimated end of the economic life of the fields, and by 2024 on the VAS gas and condensate field. 
Management believes that the current licences for the MEX-GOL and SV gas and condensate fields, which are due to expire in 
July 2024, will be extended until June 2036. 
(d) Depreciation of Development and Production Assets
Development and production assets held in property, plant and equipment are depreciated on a unit of production basis at a 
rate calculated by reference to proven and probable reserves and incorporating the estimated future cost of developing and 
extracting those reserves. Future development costs are estimated using assumptions about the number of wells required 
to produce those reserves, the cost of the wells, future production facilities and operating costs, together with assumptions 
on oil and gas realisations, and are revised annually. The reserves estimates used are determined using estimates of gas in 
place, recovery factors, future hydrocarbon prices and also take into consideration the Group’s latest development plan for 
the associated development and production asset. Additionally, the latest development plan and therefore the inputs used to 
determine the depreciation charge assume that the current licences for the MEX-GOL and SV gas and condensate fields, which 
are due to expire in July 2024, can be extended until June 2036. 
The Group is currently undertaking certain projects on the MEX-GOL and SV fields with the purpose of refining its field 
development strategy, including the required capital expenditure, and the reassessment of its mineral reserves. These projects 
include the interpretation of a reprocessed 3D seismic dataset, further analysis of technical and economic data, and ongoing 
revision of the geological model. The information that will be obtained from these projects is to be used in a reassessment of the 
remaining reserves and resources at these fields, which is planned to be completed in the middle of 2018.

3. Critical Accounting Estimates and Assumptions continued
(e) Recoverability of materials and spare parts inventory
The majority of the Group’s materials and spare parts inventory balance comprises items to be used in the Ukraine drilling 
programme. Where there is uncertainty whether these items will be realised through the drilling programme, or through sale, the 
materials are recorded at scrap value. Where materials inventory is intended for sale, management uses current market rates to 
estimate the recoverable amount through sale.
(f) Recognition of deferred tax asset
The recognition of deferred tax assets is based upon whether it is more likely than not that sufficient and suitable taxable profits 
will be available in the future against which the reversal of temporary differences can be deducted. This requires judgement for 
forecasting future profits. 
Further details of the deferred tax assets recognised can be found in Note 24. 
(g) Exchange differences on intra-group balances with foreign operations
During 2017, a Group subsidiary, Regal Petroleum Corporation (Ukraine) Limited, settled $12,480,000 of intra-group liability of 
which the Company is the beneficial owner. A further amount of $6,000,000 is expected to be settled by the end of 2018. As 
such, a foreign exchange difference of $351,000 accumulated on the intra-group balance of $14,560,000 since the date of 
de-designation of this balance as part of the Company’s net investment in the foreign operation up to 31 December 2017 was 
recognised in profit or loss in these consolidated financial statements. No reclassification of the foreign exchange difference 
accumulated in equity prior to de-designation was made as there has been no change in the Company’s proportionate 
ownership interest in the foreign operation and therefore no disposal or partial disposal of the foreign operation. There were no 
changes in management’s plans or intentions regarding the payment of intra-group balances unsettled as at 31 December 2017, 
other than the above-mentioned amount of $6,000,000, and as such, a foreign exchange difference related to the balance 
designated as net investment in a foreign operation was recognised in other comprehensive income in the Company Statement 
of Comprehensive Income for the year ended 31 December 2017.
4. Segmental Information
In line with the Group’s internal reporting framework and management structure, the key strategic and operating decisions are 
made by the Board of Directors, who review internal monthly management reports, budget and forecast information as part of 
this process. Accordingly, the Board of Directors is deemed to be the Chief Operating Decision Maker within the Group.
The Group’s only class of business activity is oil and gas exploration, development and production. The Group’s operations are 
located in Ukraine, with its head office in the United Kingdom. These geographical regions are the basis on which the Group 
reports its segment information. The segment results as presented represent operating profit before depreciation, amortisation 
and impairment of non-current assets.

4. Segmental Information continued
There are no inter-segment sales within the Group and all products are sold in the geographical region in which they are 
produced.
During 2017, the Group commenced selling all of its gas production to its related party, LLC Smart Energy (“Smart Energy”). 
Smart Energy has oil and gas operations in Ukraine and is part of the PJSC Smart-Holding Group, which is ultimately controlled 
by Mr Vadim Novinskiy, who through an indirect 54% majority shareholding, ultimately controls the Group. This arrangement 
came about as a consequence of the Ukrainian Government introducing a number of new provisions into the Ukrainian Tax 
Code over the last two years, including transfer pricing regulations for companies operating in Ukraine. The introduction of the 
new regulations has meant that there is an increased regulatory burden on affected companies in Ukraine who must prepare 
and submit reporting information to the Ukrainian Tax Authorities. Due to the corporate structure of the Group, a substantial 
proportion of its gas production is produced by a non-Ukrainian subsidiary of the Group, which operates in Ukraine as a branch, 
or representative office as it is classified in Ukraine. Under the new tax regulations, this places additional regulatory obligations 
on each of the Group’s potential customers who may be less inclined to purchase the Group’s gas and/or may seek discounts 
on sales prices. As a result of discussions between the Company and Smart Energy, Smart Energy agreed to purchase all 
of the Group’s gas production and to assume responsibility for the regulatory obligations under the Ukrainian tax regulations. 
Furthermore, Smart Energy has agreed to combine the Group’s gas production with its own gas production, and to sell such 
gas as combined volumes, which should result in higher sales prices due to the larger sales volumes. In order to cover Smart 
Energy’s sales, administration and regulatory compliance costs, the Group has agreed to sell its gas to Smart Energy at a small 
discount to the gas sales prices achieved by Smart Energy, who sell the combined volumes in line with market prices. The terms 
of sale, effective from June 2017, for the Group’s gas to Smart Energy are (i) payment for one third of the estimated monthly 
volume of gas by the 20th of the month of delivery, and (ii) payment of the remaining balance by the 10th of the month following 
the month of delivery.

2017, part of the impairment totalling $6,360,000 was reversed, which equals the amount of interest paid during the year, which 
had been fully provided for in previous years.

Due to the short-term nature of the current trade and other receivables, their carrying amount is assumed to be the same as 
their fair value. All trade receivables, except those provided for, are considered to be of high credit quality. 
At 31 December 2017, the Group’s total trade receivables amounted to $2,492,000 and 100% were denominated in Ukrainian 
Hryvnia (31 December 2016: $2,203,000 and 100% were denominated in Ukrainian Hryvnia). Further description of financial 
receivables is disclosed in Note 29.
Prepayments and accrued income mainly consists of prepayments of $3,130,000 relating to the development of the VAS field 
(31 December 2016: $1,048,000 relating to the development of the MEX-GOL field).
The current VAT receivable in respect of the Group includes $156,000 (2016: $543,000) relating to capital expenditure in Ukraine 
which is expected to be recovered via an offset against VAT payable on future sales in that country. The Group expects to offset 
the total amount of VAT receivable at 31 December 2017 during the 2018 year, and therefore no VAT receivable was included 
within non-current trade and other receivables.

Change in estimate 980  310

At end of year 3,027  1,915
The provision for decommissioning is based on the net present value of the Group’s estimated liability for the removal of the 
Ukraine production facilities and well site restoration at the end of production life. 
Amounts provided during 2016 as a result of the acquisition of LLC Prom-Enerho Produkt amounted to $816,000, reflecting a 
provision for decommissioning of existing wells, pipeline and the gas production plant at the VAS gas and condensate field.
The change in estimate during 2017 reflects a combination of a revision in the estimated costs (increase of $559,000) and the 
discount rate applied (increase of $421,000). The discount rate in real terms applied on the decommissioning cost provision at 
31 December 2017 was 4.7% (31 December 2016: 6.11%). The decrease of the discount rate at 31 December 2017 came as a 
result of a Ukrainian Eurobonds’ yield decrease and a respective decrease of Country Risk Premium. These costs are expected 
to be incurred by 2036 on the MEX-GOL and SV gas and condensate fields (2016: by 2036), and by 2024 on the VAS gas and 
condensate field, although if the costs on the MEX-GOL and SV gas and condensate fields were to be incurred at the current 
expiry of the production licences in 2024, the provision for decommissioning at 31 December 2017 would be $2,613,000  
(31 December 2016: $2,219,000).
The principal assumptions used are as follows: 
31 December 
2017
31 December 
2016
Discount rate, % 4.70% 6.11%
Average cost of restoration per well, $000 179 171

At 31 December 2017, the Group recognised a deferred tax asset of $2,567,000 in relation to UK tax losses carried forward  
(31 December 2016: $3,717,000). There was a further $83 million (31 December 2016: $85 million) of unrecognised UK tax 
losses carried forward for which no deferred tax asset has been recognised. These losses can be carried forward indefinitely, 
subject to certain rules regarding capital transactions and changes in the trade of the Company. The Directors consider it 
appropriate to recognise deferred tax assets resulting from accumulated tax losses at 31 December 2017 to the extent that  
it is probable that there will be sufficient future taxable profits.

24. Deferred Tax continued
The deferred tax asset relating to the Group’s provision for decommissioning at 31 December 2017 of $127,000 (31 December 
2016: $68,000) was recognised on the tax effect of the temporary differences on the Group’s provision for decommissioning at 
the MEX-GOL and SV gas and condensate fields, and its tax base. The deferred tax asset relating to the Group’s development 
and production assets at 31 December 2017 of $6,567,000 (31 December 2016: $7,336,000) was recognised on the tax effect 
of the temporary differences between the carrying value of the Group’s development and production asset at the MEX-GOL and 
SV gas and condensate fields, and its tax base. This is deemed recoverable on the projected future profits generated by the 
Group’s operations in Ukraine. The forecast profits are based on the current field development plan at the MEX-GOL and SV gas 
and condensate fields, and are determined using data from the same cash flow model which was used for impairment review of 
such development and production asset, as outlined in Note 15. Based on these projections, the deferred tax asset recognised 
will be recovered by 2022. However, should future field development not result in additional production, only $1 million of the $7 
million deferred tax recognised would be recoverable based on forecast profits available from the Group’s existing wells.
The deferred tax asset relating to the Group’s provision for decommissioning at 31 December 2017 of $277,000 (31 December 
2016: $151,000) was recognised on the tax effect of the temporary differences on the Group’s provision for decommissioning 
at the VAS gas and condensate fields, and its tax base. The deferred tax liability relating to the Group’s development and 
production assets at 31 December 2017 of $1,097,000 (31 December 2016: $1,338,000) was recognised on the tax effect of 
the temporary differences between the carrying value of the Group’s development and production asset at the VAS gas and 
condensate fields, and its tax base.
The impact of the UK losses surrendered to the Ukrainian operating subsidiary in relation to losses was $4,649,000 for 2015. 
There were no UK losses surrendered for the year ended 31 December 2016–2017.
Losses accumulated in a Ukrainian subsidiary service company of UAH3,130,112,486 ($111,521,999) at 31 December 2017 
and UAH2,448,430,023 ($90,046,074) at 31 December 2016 mainly originated as foreign exchange differences on inter-
company loans and for which no deferred tax asset was recognised as this subsidiary is not expected to have taxable profits to 
utilise these losses in the future.
As at 31 December 2017 and 2016, the Group has not recorded a deferred tax liability in respect of taxable temporary 
differences associated with investments in subsidiaries as the Group is able to control the timing of the reversal of those 
temporary differences and does not intend to reverse them in the foreseeable future.
UK Corporation tax change
A change to the UK corporation tax rate was announced in the Chancellor’s Budget on 16 March 2016. The change announced 
is to reduce the main tax rate to 17% from 1 April 2020. Changes to reduce the UK corporation tax rate to 19% from 1 April 
2017 and to 18% from 1 April 2020 were substantively enacted on 26 October 2015. Changes to reduce the UK corporation tax 
rate to 17% from 1 April 2020 were substantively enacted on 6 September 2016 and the effects of these changes are included 
in the consolidated financial statements.

The holders of ordinary shares are entitled to receive dividends as declared and are entitled to one vote per share at general 
meetings of shareholders. Distributable reserves are limited to the balance of retained earnings. The share premium reserves are 
not available for distribution by way of dividends.
Other reserves, the movements in which are shown in the statements of changes in equity, comprise the following:
Capital contributions reserve 
The capital contributions reserve is non-distributable and represents the value of equity invested in subsidiary entities prior to the 
Company listing.
Merger reserve
The merger reserve represents the difference between the nominal value of shares acquired by the Company and those issued 
to acquire subsidiary undertakings. This balance relates wholly to the acquisition of Regal Petroleum (Jersey) Limited and that 
company’s acquisition of Regal Petroleum Corporation Limited during 2002.
Foreign exchange reserve
Exchange reserve movement for the year are attributable to currency fluctuations. This balance predominantly represents  
the result of exchange differences on non-monetary assets and liabilities where the subsidiaries’ functional currency is not the 
US Dollar.

Capital Risk Management
The Group’s objectives when managing capital are to safeguard the Group’s and the Company’s ability to continue as a going 
concern in order to provide returns for shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders and to maintain an optimal capital 
structure to reduce the cost of capital.
The Group defines its capital as equity. The primary source of the Group’s liquidity has been cash generated from operations.
In order to maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group may adjust the amount of dividends paid to shareholders, return 
capital to shareholders, issue new shares or sell assets.
The capital structure of the Group consists of equity attributable to the equity holders of the parent, comprising issued share 
capital, share premium, reserves and retained deficit.
There are no capital requirements imposed on the Group.
The Group’s financial instruments comprise cash and cash equivalents and various items such as debtors and creditors that 
arise directly from its operations. The Group has bank accounts denominated in British Pounds, US Dollars, Euros, Canadian 
Dollars and Ukrainian Hryvnia. The Group does not have any borrowings. The main future risks arising from the Group’s financial 
instruments are currently currency risk, interest rate risk, liquidity risk and credit risk.

Foreign Currency Sensitivity Analysis
The following table presents sensitivities of profit and loss to reasonably possible changes in exchange rates applied at the end 
of the reporting period, with all other variables held constant:
2017
After tax impact on 
profit or loss 
$000 
2016
After tax impact on 
profit or loss 
$000
GBP strengthening by 30% 112 95
EUR strengthening by 30% 2 1
A positive number above indicates a decrease in loss/increase in profit where the indicated currency strengthens against 
the functional currency. For a weakening of the indicated currency against the functional currency, there would be an equal 
and opposite impact on the loss/profit, and the balances above are shown negative. A negative number above indicates an 
increase in loss/decrease in profit where the indicated currency strengthens against the functional currency. For a weakening 
of the indicated currency against the functional currency, there would be an equal and opposite impact on the loss/profit, and 
the balances above are shown positive. The Group holds currencies to match the currencies of future capital and operational 
expenditure.
Interest Rate Risk Management
The Group is not exposed to interest rate risk on financial liabilities as none of the entities in the Group have any external 
borrowings. The Group does not use interest rate forward contracts and interest rate swap contracts as part of its strategy.
The Group is exposed to interest rate risk on financial assets as entities in the Group hold money market deposits at floating 
interest rates. The risk is managed by fixing interest rates for a period of time when indications exist that interest rates may move 
adversely.
The Group’s exposure to interest rates on financial assets and financial liabilities are detailed in the liquidity risk section below.
Interest Rate Sensitivity Analysis
The sensitivity analysis below has been determined based on exposure to interest rates for non-derivative instruments at 
the balance sheet date. A 0.5% increase or decrease is used when reporting interest rate risk internally to key management 
personnel and represents management’s assessment of a reasonably possible change in interest rates.
If interest rates earned on money market deposits had been 0.5% higher/lower and all other variables were held constant, the 
Group’s:
  profit for the year ended 31 December 2017 would increase by $55,000 in the event of 0.5% higher interest rates and 
decrease by $55,000 in the event of 0.5% lower interest rates (decrease of loss for the year ended 31 December 2016 by 
$87,000 in the event of 0.5% higher interest rates and increase by $87,000 in the event of 0.5% lower interest rates). This is 
mainly attributable to the Group’s exposure to interest rates on its money market deposits; and
  other equity reserves would not be affected (2016: not affected).
Interest payable on the Group’s liabilities would have an immaterial effect on the profit or loss for the year.
Liquidity Risk
The Group’s objective throughout the year has been to ensure continuity of funding. Operations have primarily been financed 
through revenue from Ukrainian operations. 
Details of the Group’s cash management policy are explained in Note 20.
Liquidity risk for the Group is further detailed under the Principal Risks and Uncertainties section of the Strategic Report.

Credit Risk
Credit risk principally arises in respect of the Group’s cash balance and other short-term investments. In the UK, where $4.8 
million of the overall cash and cash equivalents and $16 million of other short-term investments is held (31 December 2016: 
$10.0 million cash and cash equivalents and $nil other short-term investments), the Group only deposits cash surpluses with 
major banks of high quality credit standing (Note 20). As at 31 December 2017, the remaining balance of $9.4 million of cash 
and cash equivalents was held in Ukraine (31 December 2016: $10.0 million). In May 2017, Standard & Poor’s affirmed Ukraine’s 
sovereign credit rating of “B-/B”, Outlook Stable. There is no international credit rating information available for the specific banks 
in Ukraine where the Group currently holds its cash and cash equivalents. 
The significant devaluation of the Ukrainian Hryvnia has resulted in the National Bank of Ukraine, among other measures, 
imposing comprehensive restrictions on the processing of client payments by banks, on the purchase of foreign currency on 
the inter-bank market and on the remittance of funds outside Ukraine. These restrictions, and the many other economic issues 
in Ukraine, have put great strain on the Ukrainian banking system, with increasing risks in the capital strength, liquidity and 
creditworthiness of a large number of Ukrainian banks, and very high rates in the wholesale and overnight markets. In addition, 
there have been significant deposit outflows from the banking system and widespread restructuring of bank clients’ maturing 
liabilities. Furthermore, as a result of recommendations from the International Monetary Fund, significant reforms to the Ukrainian 
banking sector are being implemented, which are intended to strengthen the capitalisation of the Ukrainian banks. 
In light of the deterioration in the banking sector in Ukraine, the Group has taken steps to diversify its banking arrangements 
between a number of banks in Ukraine. These measures are designed to spread the risks associated with each bank’s 
creditworthiness, but the Ukrainian banking sector remains weakly capitalised and so the risks associated with the banks in 
Ukraine remain significant, including in relation to the banks with which the Group operates bank accounts. 
None of the Group’s trade receivables are past due or impaired.

30. Contingencies and Commitments 
Amounts contracted in relation to the Group’s 2017 investment programme in the MEX-GOL, SV and VAS gas and condensate 
fields in Ukraine, but not provided for in the financial statements at 31 December 2017, were $3,151,000 (2016: $1,212,000). 
During 2010–2017, the Group has been in dispute with the Ukrainian tax authorities in respect of VAT receivables on imported 
leased equipment, with a disputed liability of up to UAH8,487,000 ($302,000) inclusive of penalties and other associated costs. 
There is a level of ambiguity in the interpretation of the relevant tax legislation, and the position adopted by the Group has 
been challenged by the Ukrainian tax authorities, which has led to legal proceedings to resolve the issue. The Group had been 
successful in three court cases in respect of this dispute in courts of different levels. On 20 September 2016, a hearing was held 
in the Supreme Court of Ukraine of an appeal of the Ukrainian tax authorities against the decision of the Higher Administrative 
Court of Ukraine, in which the appeal of the Ukrainian tax authorities was upheld. As a result of this appeal decision, all decisions 
of the lower courts were cancelled, and the case was remitted to the first instance court for a new trial. On 1 December 2016 
and 7 March 2017 respectively, the Group received positive decisions in the first and second instance courts, but further legal 
proceedings may arise. Since as at the end of the year, the Group had been successful in previous court cases in respect of this 
dispute in courts of different levels, the date of the next legal proceedings has not been set and as management believes that 
adequate defences exist to the claim, no liability has been recognised in these consolidated financial statements for the year 
ended 31 December 2017 (31 December 2016: nil).
