Our People
• After careful review and strategy 
implementation we have successfully 
driven down our RIDDOR rating during 
the course of 2017.
• ILM level 3, 5 and BLP level 7 accredited 
programmes have been evaluated and 
realigned with business and people 
development needs.
• Zero Environmental Incidents with a 
continuing focus on sustainability, carbon 
reduction and water footprint.  
Improvement in Operational 
Performance
• Generated £292m in revenue which 
puts the Group approximately 16% 
ahead of 2016, thanks to an exceptional 
performance from our people during the 
year.
• The adoption of IFRS15 in next year’s 
annual report is expected to result in 
restated revenue of circa £300m and 
profit and total comprehensive income 
of around £7.2m for 2017, primarily 
due to restricted recognition of variable 
income on legacy contracts in earlier 
years. Further details of the expected 
transition can be found in note 1.
• Our cash balance as at 31 December 
2017 stood at £17.01 million, an 
increase of £5.60 million from 2016.
• Current order book for construction in 
2018 stands at approximately £299m, 
which is just over 90% of the revenue 
expectations for the current year.
*  Underlying profit is profit before tax, excluding legacy contract losses of £7.29m (2016: £3.85m). Legacy 
contracts are construction contracts entered into at the height of the recession, before 31 December 2013, 
and which carried a high commercial and contractual risk. These contracts have negatively impacted the 
Group’s income statement in 2013 and subsequent years.
** Net cash is cash at the bank at year end less any obligations under finance leases.

Cash
Cash continued to be generated from operations during 
the year with the cash position at the year end significantly 
improving to £17.01 million (2016: £11.41 million).
Dividend
The Board is proposing a maintained dividend of 3.0p per share 
thus increasing the full year dividend to 6.0p (2016: 4.5p).
Corporate Governance
The Board remains very aware of the risks that the business 
faces as it continues to grow in a highly competitive 
environment and undertakes contracts of a higher notational 
value. Risk management capabilities continue to be 
strengthened and stringent review of potential opportunities is 
The Group has promising opportunities for growth in all its chosen markets and as 
the key customer relationships continue to mature, projects of a higher value are 
becoming available.

Recent Performance
The Group has increased its underlying profit for the year, which 
is a very encouraging result. However, it is disappointing to 
report that the strong growth in both revenue and profitability 
has been significantly impacted upon by the ongoing legacy 
contractual dispute with Cyden Homes Limited and the poor 
second half trading performance of the Utilities division. 
 
Group revenue increased by 16.48% to £291.77 million 
(2016: £250.49 million) with operating profit decreasing by 
46.88% to £1.19 million (2016: £2.24 million). Excluding 
the deleterious effect of the legacy contract normal trading 
profitability improved by 40.44% to £8.30 million (2016: £5.91 
million). Earnings per share declined by 71.80% to 7.31p (2016: 
25.95p).

undertaken. Robust and effective governance is more essential 
than ever. Procedures and controls continue to be reviewed on 
a regular basis to ensure the protection of shareholder interests.
Our People
Our people are the cornerstone of the Group, particularly in 
an organisation that still undertakes a significant proportion 
of its workload utilising its own resources. In an increasingly 
competitive market, the attraction, development and retention 
of the calibre of resource, with the appropriate skills required 
to satisfy the growth potential of the Group, is of paramount 
importance.
We are intent on maintaining the development of a sustainable, 
ethical business that cares for its individuals, the environment 
and the communities where it both impacts on and draws 
its resources from. Investment in leadership, skill-based 
and professional qualification attainment training has been 
maintained to allow each individual to contribute to their full 
potential. Testament to this is the number of training days 
completed increasing by 23.7% over the previous year.
To achieve our strategic targets the creation of a more diverse 
workforce is essential and in the construction industry in 
general gender disparity still continues. This is the first year that 
a Gender Pay Gap report has been published and it reflects 
the lower proportion of women in senior roles within the Group. 
This, coupled with only an 11% total female representation 
within the Group is outdated. A more progressive and 
embracing approach is now being adopted to secure the 
injection of female talent that is required to take the Group 
forward and provide a different perspective to the business.
I would also like to take this opportunity to thank all the 
employees for their hard work and commitment during this 
last year as the business is entirely dependent upon their 
contribution.
Health and Safety
The well-being of all the Group’s employees is of paramount 
concern to your Board. The cycle of improved performance 
has been maintained with the “Accident Frequency Rate” (AFR) 
reducing to a highly creditable 0.04 (2016: 0.11). The culture is 
now well embedded with the emphasis moving from “Safe to 
Safer”.
Opportunity for Growth
The Group has promising opportunities for growth in all its 
chosen markets and as the key customer relationships continue 
to mature, projects of a higher value are becoming available. 
The AMP7 retendering cycle by certain water companies 
equally offers a further opportunity for future expansion within 
the water industry. The Group is currently engaged in several 
joint ventures, which currently are all delivering positively. The 
Elan Valley Aqueduct, in particular, already being the recipient of 
several awards.
Outlook
The secured order book for completion in the current year is 
£299 million (2017: £225 million) and the Group is forecasting 
further sustainable growth this current year based upon this 
and further opportunities in the pipeline.

Market 
Review
UK Economic Conditions
Economic growth will continue to rise in four of our five key 
market sectors primarily due to ongoing investment in UK 
National Infrastructure, sustained increase in the demand 
and provision of university places and the growing need 
for increased social and private housing. The only sector 
where there is a significant downturn over the next three 
years is fibre broadband installation as a result of the near 
completion of the roll out programme, which will impact on 
our Telecommunications segment.
The unemployment rate is at a record low, which in 
conjunction with the skills gap and growth in our market 
sectors will set us challenges with regard to recruiting and 
retaining the right people.
Brexit has caused uncertainty around the UK economy in 
general and this has the potential to distort some of our 
markets, including price pressures in our supply chain due 
to the weakening of the pound.
What this means for NM Group
We expect significant profitable growth during the next 
three years in line with our in-depth Strategic Business Plan 
projections. This will not only be as a result of increased 
investment but the specific areas of investment where we 
already provide a specialist service.
Our Plan details how we will maximise these niche 
opportunities to significantly improve our return on 
investment.
Construction Market
The National Infrastructure and Construction Pipeline 
Analysis 2016 identifies committed government investment 
in the Affordable Homes Programme rising to circa £2.2 
billion in the period 2018/2019, with sustained investment 
of circa £2 billion from 2019 to 2021. Whilst the Housing 
Infrastructure Fund programme has had a slow start in 
2017/2018, it is forecast to rise to circa £800 million and 
circa £1.2 billion in 2019/2020 and 2020/2021 respectively.
Universities continue to have access to significant funds to 
develop their sites primarily to attract more students. As 
such, investment in student accommodation looks set to 
continue to support this potential growth.
According to the DfE National pupil projections (July 
2016), we have experienced a demographic dip in 
student numbers during the last five years. However, as 
a result of successive baby booms from the start of the 
new millennium this downward trend has changed with a 
defined increase in 18-year olds of 8% by 2020 compared 
to 2017 and a further 10% increase by 2025 compared 
to 2020. This equates to circa 160,000 more university 
places being required by 2025, based on record numbers 
of 18-year olds going to university in 2017.

The National Infrastructure and Construction Pipeline 
Analysis 2016 identifies 36 wind farms in England granted 
planning permission, all of which expire by 2019. Full 
capital investment runs at circa £3 billion up to 2018/19 
but then worryingly the investment profile halves over the 
period 2018/19 to 2019/20 and then rapidly declines to 
circa £250 million by 2020/21.
Annual investment in the electricity transmission and 
distribution network is set to fall to circa £1 billion by 
2020/21 from levels of circa £1.2 billion in 2018/19. 
Thereafter, however, it will increase to just over £1.1 billion 
for follow-on years.
Waste to Energy and Biomass annual investment currently 
runs at circa £1 billion; however, all identified projects will 
be complete by the end of 2019.
What this means for NM Group
• Investment downturn in wind energy
• Investment increase in transmission and distribution, 
focusing on upgrade and refurbishment
• Downturn in waste to energy plant investments over next 
three years
Highways Market
Highways England have announced the replacement of 
their Collaborative Delivery Framework, worth £4 billion 
over four years, with an option for an additional four years 
(January 2019 to December 2027). They are looking 
to appoint 12 partners over six areas; this equates to 
£1 billion per annum and £60 million to £80 million per 
contractor.
The National Infrastructure and Construction Pipeline 
Analysis 2016 identifies committed government investment 
in highways infrastructure of circa £1.2 billion in 2018/2019 
rising to circa £1.4 billion in 2019/2020. This spend 
excludes motorway improvement programmes, SMART 
motorway investment and individual major A road projects. 
This will be updated in 2019 to reflect new investment 
plans for the period 2020–2024.
What this means for NM Group
• Annual rise in highways investment in excess of 10%
• Increase in funding for highway repair and maintenance

Telecommunications Market
Government and private investment in the broadband 
programme and 4G technology is due to reach peak spend 
in 2018/2019: £3.45 billion. 
Spend in 2019/2020 is then due to marginally decline to 
circa £3.4 billion before significantly reducing in 2020/2021 
to circa £1.1 billion. Thereafter, the only identified 
communications investment programme is the 700MHz 
Clearance but this is a small programme at an annual spend 
of circa £50 million by 2021/2022.
In view of this rapid decline by 2020 we need to consider 
our options, such as developing alternative market streams 
during 2018/19 which utilise the skills of our Utilities division.
Water Market
The sector is forecast to continue at current investment 
levels of circa £4 billion per annum. Of this, there is a 
commitment to spend circa £2 billion per annum on 
upgrades and new works including circa 40% through 
off-site build solutions, £1.2 billion per annum on capital 
maintenance and £500 million per annum on infrastructure 
schemes. The fundamental change over the next 10 years 
will be the specific work stream investments, with a move to 
more asset optimisation, maintenance, refurbishment and 
sludge to energy to meet TotEx and Outcome based drivers.
New technologies for pipeline sealing and replacement 
will potentially negate intrusive R&M. Increases in housing 
(250,000 homes per annum) will fuel existing plant 
optimisation and demand innovative ways to increase 
productivity from existing assets. 
What this means for NM Group
• Increased investment in asset optimisation, maintenance 
and refurbishment
• Increase in ‘Off-site’ and Factory Build solutions
• Preference for ‘Direct Delivery’ models as part of 
approach to sustainable resources and communities 
What this means for NM Group
• Rapid decline in new telecoms infrastructure investment
• Implementation of G.Fast Technology at 10 million 
premises across the United Kingdom by the end of 2020
• Diversification of skills into other sectors will need to be 
implemented

STRATEGIC REPORT 25748  5 April 2018 11:24 AM  Proof 14
Chief Executive’s  
Statement
John Homer | Chief Executive
Overview of the year
It is disappointing that the focus on a healthy underlying Group 
performance from continuing operations appears to continue to 
be diverted by the outcome of the remaining legacy contract.
The overall focus of our strategic plan is built around continuing 
with the six strategic priorities identified with an increased focus 
on our people, our quality first approach and further investment 
in technology.
Cash
Our continued focus on driving a cash culture throughout the 
business has made good progress in the year. The emphasis 
on cash being the responsibility of the operational divisions with 
reports and measures being provided by the finance function is 
starting to have the desired effect. The cash balance at the end 
of the year of £17.01 million is testament to the progress that 
has been made.
Our focus on the type of work to be undertaken will be to 
continue to build on the core strengths and capabilities of the 
Group. It is intended to continue to play to our strengths in the 
Water sector while looking for growth in other areas to reduce 
our reliance on this market and mitigate the cyclical effects of 
the AMP procurement cycle. 
Utilities losses
At the interim update we announced that the division achieved 
a break even position for the first six months trading. Since 
that date we have experienced serious difficulties on the work 
stream undertaken for Virgin Media on the term contract for 
telecoms work. Our activities have become embroiled in the 
difficulties that this customer has been experiencing and this 
has led to fragmented and inefficient working patterns. The 
division is heavily engaged in dialogue with this customer to 
achieve a satisfactory resolution to this problem. 
Operations
It is pleasing to be able to report good progress is being seen 
on improving the operational performance of the remainder of 
the Group. Our short term target of achieving 3% net return 
on sales is firmly within our sights. Our vision of 5% margins in 
the future is achievable by continuing to enhance our offering 
upstream into design, project investment and by delivering 
more efficiently. The employment of our direct labour force and 
operation of our own plant fleet will assist our drive for margin 
growth. The use of off site build techniques will combat skill 
shortages and ensure that quality of workmanship is achieved.
Order book
The markets in which we operate remain buoyant and the need 
for investment into the infrastructure of the nation continues 
to grow. We continue to exercise critical judgement over the 
orders we take into the business and ensure that effective 
governance is in place at all stages of securing work. Our order 
book for construction in 2018 stands at £299 million (2016: 
£225 million).
Safety
It is pleasing to see that our Health and Safety performance 
has improved significantly during this year. From a 2016 AFR 
of 0.11 which represented five RIDDORs we are currently 
running at 0.04 which represents two RIDDORs for 2017. Our 
efforts in compliance with procedures and focus on behaviours 
have helped in this achievement. It is however clearly apparent 
16 North Midland Construction PLC Annual Report and Accounts for the year ended 31 December 2017 25748  5 April 2018 11:24 AM  Proof 14
that a focus on this at all times is a must and a slight slip in 
concentration can lead to a hazard causing an accident.
People and culture
People remain the key to our success and we intend to build 
on our achievements in this area. Our offering of leadership 
and management programmes has been refreshed and is 
now accredited under the new Apprenticeship Levy. Two 
programmes have commenced and feedback is positive. Our 
assessment of potentials for growth and succession planning 
continues to serve us well and this approach is improving with 
maturity of its use in the business. 
We have started re-evaluation of our entire Employee 
Experience agenda and workshops have been held at the 
Leadership Briefing sessions so that everyone has the chance 
to contribute to the future culture of the Group. This has been 
well received. It is an undisputed fact that our people and 
our culture are the single largest competitive advantage that 
we have.
We have committed wholeheartedly to the Apprenticeship 
programme through our own in-house academy. We currently 
have 7% of our workforce engaged on this programme.
Technology
During this year we have continued to invest in our digital future 
and progressing our BIM agenda. A decision was taken in the 
middle of the year to defer the application for British Standard 
certification until this was embedded in the business. The 
certification will be applied for in early 2018. A commitment to 
Viewpoint 4 Projects as our Common Data Environment (CDE) 
has been made and we are rolling this out across the business. 
A lot more work needs to be done on this to realise the full 
efficiency potential that exists.
Supply chain
Investment continues to be made into the creation and 
development of the supply chain required to support our 
growth. Supplier relationships are reviewed regularly on a 360 
degree basis. A number of interactive workshop sessions have 
been held throughout the year. It is pleasing to see our creditor 
days recorded at 43 which is an incremental improvement on 
52 in 2016 and 60 in 2015. It is intended that we continue to 
seek to improve our performance in this area. 
Skills shortage
We continue to focus on both our positive employee brand 
and alternative methods in order to combat the skills shortage. 
It is clear that our ability to attract and retain the right quality 
and quantity of people to undertake work is a driver for us. 
Our efforts on the training and development front are showing 
good results. We are particularly pleased with our approach to 
the new government Apprenticeship Levy and intend to build 
further on this success
Conclusion
The business is well positioned for growth going forward. 
A solid order book for construction in 2018 of £299 million 
coupled with a strong cash balance of £17.01 million recorded 
at the year end provides a solid baseline to drive performance 
going forward.
Our continued focus on ensuring rigorous governance in 
contract selectivity and operational control, coupled with the 
advancement of our Employee Experience programme will 
ensure that momentum is achieved on achieving our goals.

Our  
Strategy
Our Brand
Our objective is to construct a sustainable and growing business through good leadership and effective communication. Our 
strategy reflects the restoration of a respectable profit margin in the short term. This will be reflected in a progressive dividend 
payment to the shareholders being declared. It is built with a clear focus on quality of earnings and improved cash management 
together with a sensible growth profile being pursued.
Driving Cash
Description
We will continue to embed a cash 
culture to manage our cash more 
effectively, from contract selection 
and approval, through the entire 
contract process and up to the final 
account payment. This includes 
improved operational reporting and 
flow of information to divisional 
management. 
Improve Profit
Description
The emphasis being placed on 
preventing losses as a strategic 
priority will in itself give rise to an 
improvement in profit. Other work 
is in progress to enhance margin 
return through the reduction in waste 
and the use of lean construction 
techniques. Innovative approaches 
to front end design and asset 
management opportunities will 
provide enhanced margin returns.
Prevent Losses
Description
We have thoroughly re-examined 
our processes across the business 
to continuously improve our effective 
commercial and operational delivery 
of projects. We are engaging and 
challenging our people and our 
supply chain to continually improve 
quality and programme efficiency 
and effectively deliver for our 
customers.
Develop, Maintain and 
Protect Our People
Description
People remain key to our success. 
Keeping a “family feel” around 
the Group is a high priority as we 
progress. Recruitment and retention 
is at a high. We will continue with our 
learning and development. This is 
aligned with our business culture.
Enhance Brand 
Image
Description
We have identified two core focus 
points in enhancing our brand 
image: Customer Experience and 
Public Relations (PR). We have 
formed the Improving Customer 
Experience Panel (iCEP) with the 
purpose of providing industry 
leading customer experience. We 
are reviewing our PR plan, core 
media targets and approach to be 
more visible in the marketplace. 
A senior project team has been 
commissioned to look at this.
Effective 
Communication
Description
Effective communication, both 
internally and externally, is 
undergoing review and improvement 
to ensure that our key business 
messages are conveyed in both 
an appropriate format and a timely 
manner. A senior project team has 
been commissioned to look at our 
overall communication strategy in 
line with our brand and input from all 
stakeholder groups.

Driving 
Cash
Progress in 2017
Actions we instigated as part of our 2017 business plan 
included a daily cash report, weekly finance dashboard and 
monthly trading assessments of unrealised cash. This has 
resulted in a significant overall improvement in the cash balance 
to £17.01 million (2016: £11.41 million) and reduced unrealised 
cash. 
The Group has slightly reduced the average credit period taken 
by its customers to 32 days (2016: 33 days). The average credit 
period taken on credit purchases has also reduced to 43 days 
(2016: 52 days) due to shorter terms being offered to maintain 
the best supply chain and achieve the most commercial pricing.
Priorities for 2018
We will continue to embed a cash culture to manage our 
cash more effectively, the focus being right down to project 
level; from contract selection and approval, through the entire 
contract process and up to the final account payment. This 
includes improved operational reporting and flow of information 
to project teams and divisional management. Driving cash 
allows us to ensure it flows to our supply chain who are critical 
for our growth plans and pivotal in our future success.
Our priorities for 2018 include the continuing execution 
of robust internal processes, coupled with the ongoing 
measurement of cash collection days, and utilising the cash 
we generate in higher margin activities or to achieve the most 
effective commercial position from our supply chain.
Our Measures
• Cash collection days (WIP/Debt days combined)
• Cash collection against forecast
• Overdue balances
• Overdue retentions
Our Associated Risks
• Credit risk, liquidity risk, interest rate risk
• Integrity of financial controls
• Contracting strategy and execution
Weekly cash dashboard
During 2017, we formalised a weekly cash dashboard which 
is circulated every Monday morning to all of the divisional 
directors, senior teams and commercial teams. 
The dashboard gives real time information, assessing the 
outstanding cash in relation to:
• Under-certified applications outstanding
• Invoiced debt overdue
• Retentions overdue
• Forecast cash collection against actual (rolling 4 week period)
This information allows the management of cash at a project 
level, ensuring that as the Group grows control of cash 
collection is rigorously maintained.

Case Study
Improve 
Profit
Progress in 2017
The success of this strategic objective has unfortunately been 
undermined by another one of our strategic objectives, due 
to significant losses on the one remaining legacy contract. 
Focusing on the underlying performance of the Group as 
defined, the Group has reported underlying profits of £8.30 
million (2016: £5.91 million) which is a net return on sales of 
2.84% (2016: 2.36%). This is testament to the move into higher 
margin markets, products and services which will continue into 
2018 and beyond.
Priorities for 2018
As stated above the Group is focused on continuing to 
organically progress in higher margin markets, products and 
services, namely offsite manufacture, design services, bespoke 
major projects and small development opportunities. This will 
continue at a divisional level throughout the period. As part of 
the 2018 business plan the Board identified areas where the 
continuing business would be able to increase its margins and 
this is also where significant focus will be given.
‘Quality first initiative’ – The purpose is to raise awareness, 
challenge the norms and drive improvements and workplace 
satisfaction, leading to benefits for all involved:
• Increased margin
• Supports a sustainable business
• Removes environmental waste 
• Quality product for our clients, right first time with less 
disruption and time delays
• Efficiency for the Group and our supply chain
• Continued development of our culture in satisfaction of 
delivering a successful project
Our Measures
• Margin by contract
• Risks and opportunities identified and monitored by project
• Cost of non-conformance reporting
• Procurement savings
• Programme management
Our Associated Risks
• Contracting strategy and execution
• Inappropriate contract terms 
• Failure to comply could lead to reputational damage, 
warranty claims or financial penalties
• Integrity of financial controls
NM Investments
During 2017, the Group reviewed the best use of the cash 
it generated and the current opportunities across its market 
segments. One of the key successes in this area was partnering 
with developers in the residential property market through:
• Joint venture on a small residential development
• Construction financing 
Both business models ensured the Group was fully securitised. 
The projects were only on a very small scale in relation to the 
Group’s turnover, but allowed significant additional margin to be 
achieved.

Prevent  
Losses
Progress in 2017
Although on the face of the financial results it would seem that 
the Group has gone backwards in relation to this strategic 
priority, it is only the one remaining legacy contract that has 
significantly affected financial performance in 2017. 
The changes the Group has made have ensured that during 
2017 there has not been any contract added to the Group’s 
commercial risk register, which is testament to the following 
changes that have been embedded in the Group’s procedures 
through 2017:
• Thorough contract selection 
• Robust corporate governance 
• Rigorous risk management 
• Active contract performance monitoring 
• Immediate corrective action 
• Contract risk level review 
• Project monitoring assessments 
We believe that discussing and understanding the potential 
risks at an earlier stage and engaging with the right skilled 
people means that we are able to better plan and mitigate 
accordingly.
Priorities for 2018
We will continue to review our processes across the business to 
continuously drive effective commercial and operational delivery 
of projects, extending the work already completed in 2017.
A key focus for 2018 and beyond is understanding the potential 
level of change in projects. Change means additional cost 
for our client, our supply chain and the Group and we believe 
reducing the potential for change at the onset of a project will 
benefit all stakeholders. The management of significant change 
on projects is also an area of strategic focus for 2018.
Our Measures
• Contract risk level review 
• Change management assessment and reporting
• Project monitoring assessments
• Margin by contract
• Risks and opportunities identified and monitored
Our Associated Risks
• Contracting strategy and execution
• Integrity of financial controls
• Contractual disputes
• Damage to reputation
• Financial loss
• Lack of integrity of financial information used to manage the 
business
Tender review board (“TRB”)
The TRB process is the Group’s internal pre-pricing risk 
assessment of potential projects. 
The pre-pricing procedures ensure that assessments and 
understanding of risk are completed at an earlier stage in the 
process and our governance strengthened to involve divisional 
and Board Directors as required. 
The processes have been developed to drive a culture of 
transparency and team involvement. The system is fully 
automated, and in 2017 has ensured no potential loss making 
contract has been added to the commercial risk register.

Develop, Maintain 
and Protect Our People
Progress in 2017
Protecting our people: 
We have significantly reduced our Accident Frequency Rate by 
63.64% and have also seen a 15% reduction in service strikes 
in 2017.  
Our Safety Culture Team (SCT) continues to work with our 
Leadership and Safety team to solve issues in line with our 
strategic focus areas and findings from our cultural survey 
results. The individuals are willing, enthusiastic volunteers who 
act as the conduit between our sites and management purely 
focusing on operational improvement. 
“Safe by Action Days” have remained part of our 2017 
programme. Our Directors visited over 20 sites and 
workshops to purely focus on safety, demonstrating our high 
level commitment to protecting our people. Key findings 
were predominantly positive with compliance, behaviours, 
understanding and site set up all featuring.
Developing our people:
Our development of high performing leaders and teams has 
led us to review, evaluate and realign our ILM level 3, 5 and 
BLP level 7 accredited programmes. All programmes were 
relaunched in October 2017, to ensure we continue to meet the 
current and future Group vision. 
2017 has provided the foundations to build upon for our 
“Employee Experience” focus by implementing a health and 
wellbeing framework and associated initiatives, and improving 
communications and reward and recognition mechanisms, to 
ensure our people feel valued for the contribution they make. 
Please see our case study on page 46 for further details.  
Priorities for 2018
• Embed “Create Safety” culture 
• Continue to monitor and improve operational engagement 
from a safety perspective
• Focus on our overall “Employee Experience” and the people 
journey with the Group 
• Furthering our health and wellbeing strategy
• Continuing to embed and mature our coaching and learning 
culture
Our Measures
• Recruiting right first time
• Internal promotions following personal development
• Increase in technical competence upskilling
• Employee stability index
Our Associated Risks
• Quality, Environment, Safety & Health (QESH) performance
• Retention of our existing people
• Attraction of new people to the Group
• Lack of required expertise to deliver the Group’s objectives
Creating Safety: from safe, to safer 
Although we have seen a significant reduction in our AFR 
in 2017, our team recognises the challenge to improve our 
current safe working methods and continually looks to bring 
incremental improvements to move from safe, to safer. 
“Creating Safety” is our approach to challenging the beliefs and 
behaviours of everyone in the Group. We have identified and 
evaluated ourselves on 18 areas relating to our positive Health 
and Safety culture which has provided us with focus action 
areas including: workplace environment, data measurement 
and defining accountability. Having identified these actions we 
are implementing operationally led improvement plans across 
the Group. 
To support this approach we are introducing inductions to our 
safety culture; these interactive scenario-based sessions will be 
holistic in nature giving a view on what our safety culture feels 
and looks like coupled with engagement, pride and personal 
responsibility.

Enhance  
Brand Image
Our Brand
Progress in 2017
Our objectives for 2017 included a review of our PR campaign 
that ensured a consistent high quality image, coupled with 
engagement in thought leadership initiatives. We selected a 
new PR agency to work alongside us in achieving our aims 
resulting in national coverage, increased quality trade press and 
an enhanced profile within the marketplace. 
We have made significant progress with Customer Experience 
after forming the Improving Customer Experience Panel (iCEP). 
As part of our plan we have implemented further mechanisms 
to promote a higher level of satisfaction for our customers and 
continuing to improve our service delivery. Further information 
on this can be found in our Sustainability section on page 48.
A brand audit and perception exercise was also undertaken 
during the year by senior management. Feedback has been 
sought on the perception of our brand from many areas of 
the business and encompassed both internal and external 
stakeholders.  
Priorities for 2018
• Targeted PR campaign including programme of awards
• Enhancement of Customer Experience
• Continuing brand audit
Our Measures
• Increase in PR article take up and thought leadership pieces
• Defined processes and pro formas developed for Customer 
Experience
• Brand Review
Our Associated Risks
• Breaches of our ethical standards
• Potential damage to reputation and customer relationships
Exploring our brand perception
Following the work by a senior management team we began a 
full brand audit seeking feedback from a variety of stakeholders 
both internal and external.  
The ultimate aims are to ensure that our brand represents the 
geographical customer base that our business now supports, 
has longevity, complements our “Employee Experience”, aligns 
with our vision and values and will continue to be a strong 
presence in the markets we serve.  
This process will continue throughout 2018. We are engaging 
with the necessary experienced agencies to ensure that we 
reach the right conclusion.

Effective  
Communication
Progress in 2017
As part of our Business Leadership programme, a team of 
senior leaders assessed our communication strategy, in line 
with our brand and input from internal and external stakeholder 
groups. This brought both encouraging findings from our 
internal people satisfaction survey and recommendations to 
enhance our future strategy for communication.  
These recommendations and research drove significant change 
during the year and has shaped how we will successfully 
implement our plans during 2018. Our progress has included:
• A focused approach and activity plan to utilise multiple 
channels for improving our internal communications
• Recruitment of a Group Communications Manager
• Enhancing our Leadership Briefings based on the feedback 
from our people

Our case study below highlights more about our regional 
Leadership Briefings and the “DREAMS” employee workshops 
held in 2017. We were encouraged by the honesty and 
openness of the feedback received; a true testament to our 
open culture. Key themes, at the heart of all regions, included 
the need for clearer lines of communication and sharing of 
information, how we can enhance our brand, and personal 
development plans with a review of reward and recognition 
mechanisms that are more suited to a modern environment. 
Priorities for 2018
• Communication audit: Analysis of our communication 
process, defining gaps and prioritising areas for improvement
• Holding communication workshops involving key 
stakeholders to agree the strategic approach to engagement 
and communication
• Review our colleague engagement strategy based on 
the audit findings and using the four key principles of 
engagement: listening, storytelling, taking risks to deepen 
engagement and use of digital channels
• Selection of champions from each division to become 
communication ambassadors
• Develop a solution for our Group through visible and 
empowering leadership, engaging managers, giving 
employees a voice and having organisational integrity
Our Measures
• Level of engagement from our people for internal 
communication: alerts, news bulletins, and Blueprint 
magazine
• Leadership briefing feedback and increase in net promoter 
score
• Increase in social media interactivity
Our Associated Risks
• Potential damage to reputation and customer relationships
• Keeping our existing people happy
• Attracting new people to the Group
Leadership briefings
Our business leadership briefings have proved popular and of 
benefit to our leaders and our people. Through engagement 
with senior leaders and feedback received, we have continually 
developed the content of these sessions, which are held during 
spring, summer and autumn.
An update on our Group strategy and strategic priorities 
and feedback from the previous briefing, with a highlight of 
subsequent actions implemented, forms the base of our 
briefings. This has been invaluable to the engagement of our 
people and improving face to face communication.

Construction
Building Division
With our key senior staff now in 
place, we have set out our growth 
plans and have a real opportunity 
to progress our business through 
2018 and beyond.
Overall segment performance
Our Building division has grown rapidly over the past three 
years, and is anticipated to be a £40m plus turnover business. 
With our key senior staff now in place, we have clearly set out 
our growth plans and have a real opportunity to progress our 
business through 2018 and beyond.  
Trading in 2017 has seen us reach our profit target, with 
turnover exceeding budget. We currently have a number of 
projects on site: Denby Street, Sheffield - a £24m student 
accommodation development with the second site at £8.5m 
for Host Student Operators and at Grove Park, Leicester a 
£1.7m new office project for Stephen George and Partners 
(Architects). This is another scheme for us on this business 
complex. We also completed the £4m Selly Oak student 
accommodation project in Birmingham during 2017. These 
schemes, coupled with exciting enquiries means that we are 
set to have a successful 2018.
We have plenty of opportunities available to us as the market 
is relatively settled and should be able to support our planned 
growth. Both the student accommodation sector and 
residential markets are still strong with regular opportunities 
being received. Equally, enquiries from the health sector are still 
encouraging and university funding for site development is still 
at a high enabling us to target schemes in both areas. 
Outlook for 2018
Our intention is to strengthen our brand within the construction 
marketplace to ensure our offering is visible to all our customers 
to encourage new opportunities and repeat business. We 
continue to foster relationships with developers operating 
locally, including a series of opportunities with our joint venture 
partner Earl and Pelham Limited across the region. The first 
scheme of this nature, Enderleigh Mews in Nottingham, is a 
development of 10 four-bedroom houses in the picturesque 
grounds of the house formerly known as Enderleigh. The 
partnership will bring high quality, bespoke developments to 
Nottingham and the wider area. 
Key targets for 2018 include:
• Enhancement of customer experience and support 
• Develop supply chain relationships and management 
• Continue with our positive staff culture, supporting all our 
team in their development

Civils Division
Our refocused and rebranded 
approach will enable us to target, 
secure and deliver major schemes 
from the power, energy and water 
sectors. 
Overall segment performance
The current financial year has been challenging operationally 
in many aspects with a downturn in customer spend which is 
forecast to continue.
With an eye to the future we have made changes to our 
operational teams and have overhauled our strategy in 
accordance with customer spend profile and marketplace 
funding. We intend to fully incorporate Civil Engineering 
projects and work into the NMCNomenca delivery division. This 
refocused and rebranded approach will enable us to target, 
secure and deliver major schemes from the power, energy and 
water sectors. The new structure will continue to deliver our 
current framework commitments within the small works team. 
For continuity of service for our customers we are utilising the 
existing teams from Civil Engineering to deliver new projects. 
Outlook for 2018
Development of a fully integrated Power business servicing the 
following areas whilst continuing to foster relationships with our 
key customers:
• Power Distribution and Transmission
• Wind
• Combined Heat Power
• Anaerobic Digestion
• Waste to Energy
• Biomass Fuel Handling

Highways
Highways Division
Growth for the division has been very 
encouraging over the course of the year 
with key successes on frameworks 
coupled with wins of public realm and 
highway contracts.
Overall segment performance
The trading performance of our Highways division has seen 
budgeted targets exceeded. Work volumes were ahead of the 
forecast for the year at £45m and delivery margins were also 
ahead of budget projections at £639k. The division operates 
in three regions: East, West and South. Whilst planned activity 
in the East and West regions remains high, there is a current 
imbalance of work in the Southern region. Growth for the 
division has been very encouraging over the course of the year 
with key successes on frameworks coupled with wins of public 
realm and highway contracts. 
The YORcivil2 construction framework win was a key success 
covering civil engineering works for North and South Yorkshire, 
including major flood defence projects and highway and bridge 
works. It combines East Riding of Yorkshire Council, located 
in the North and East of the region, with Leeds City Council 
and Sheffield City Council in the South and West and includes 
projects ranging up to a value of £10m. 
Another significant success is the Manchester City Council, 
four year supplier framework for highways and infrastructure 
projects. The entire framework is expected to deliver works 
to a value of £240m across the Greater Manchester region, 
including highways development, bridge construction and 
other civils works. This framework can also be used by other 
Association of Greater Manchester Authorities (AGMA) and 
having secured a place on all eight lots will see us work across 
the region through to 2022.
We have also successfully gained access to the following 
regional highways frameworks: Bristol City Council’s Highways 
and Associated Works Framework; Lincolnshire County 
Council; and Nottingham and Derby Frameworks for Highway 
Works.
From a public realm perspective we have successfully delivered 
prestigious public realm schemes in Bristol, Stoke-on-Trent and 
Lincoln to improve roads and pavements in the cities’ retail and 
commercial centres. We have also completed a number of large 
infrastructure projects for IKEA providing vital access to their 
new store in Sheffield and a £17m infrastructure project for York 
Potash in Whitby.
Outlook for 2018
Following the success of our key wins during 2017 we are 
looking forward to maximising our opportunities under these 
frameworks over the course of the coming year and have 
identified further areas of development in highway maintenance 
and geographical expansion.

Telecommunications
Utilities Division
2017 has been focused on 
improving performance of the 
division. Projects are performing well 
with the necessary levels of control 
and governance in place to ensure 
targets are monitored and achieved. 
Overall segment performance
This year has been focused on improving operational 
performance of the division. Network expansion projects 
are performing well with the necessary levels of control and 
governance in place to ensure targets are monitored and 
achieved.
Our framework contracts do have their challenges in terms 
of work volumes and process consistency; however, we are 
working to improve this performance across the division to 
increase customer service. Due to the high volume of orders 
from existing telecoms customers, this work has been our 
focus. It remains a priority for the management team to diversify 
by developing our design and build capability.  
At the interim update we announced that the division achieved 
a break even position for the first six months trading. Since 
that date we have experienced serious difficulties on the work 
stream undertaken for Virgin Media on the term contract for 
telecoms work. Our activities have become embroiled in the 
difficulties that this customer has been experiencing and this 
has led to fragmented and inefficient working patterns. The 
division is heavily engaged with dialogue with this customer to 
achieve a satisfactory resolution of this problem.
Our health and safety record and culture has significantly 
improved through an increase in and higher quality of reporting 
enabling us to make changes to keep our people safe. We 
have also been working hard on our customer experience, 
implementing new processes and procedures following external 
reviews. This has seen us restore our position as a partner 
of choice for Virgin Media which has in turn provided the 
opportunity for additional works, particularly in the Midlands 
region.  
Outlook for 2018
In order to drive further business improvement during the 
course of 2018, we have identified the following key areas we 
regard as critical to success: 
• People – Ensuring the morale of our teams remains high
• Quality – Continue with implementing processes with 
continual review
• Programme – Balancing our standalone projects and our 
framework commitments
• Customer – Focus on our customer relationships and 
commercial performance

NMCNomenca Division
The division has had another 
strong year financially with notable 
progress on flagship schemes and 
significant wins.
Overall segment performance
The NMCNomenca division has had another strong year being 
cash positive and turnover standing at £114m with notable 
progress on flagship schemes and significant wins. 
We were successful in securing a new joint venture 
infrastructure contract for Severn Trent Water on the 
Birmingham Resilience Project. The design and construction 
of a new water treatment plant at Frankley is worth in excess 
of £100m over the duration of the contract and is being built 
out with our partner Doosan Enpure Limited. The scheme 
commenced on site in the third quarter of 2017 and will be 
delivered over the next three years.
The Elan Valley Aqueduct scheme, another key project for 
Severn Trent in the AMP6 programme of works, celebrated 
365 days accident free and completed the first tunnelling 
phase of the project. This has culminated in being awarded 
the New Civil Engineer Tunnelling Award in the category of 
Specialist Tunnelling Project of the Year. It was a blend of the 
complex nature of the construction of three tunnels along with 
sustainability, community engagement and logistics that won 
the accolade.
Tunnelling also commenced on the Newark improvement 
scheme, Severn Trent’s largest investment in the East Midlands 
to protect their customers from flooding. The new 4.5km of 
pipeline has a diameter of 3.2 metres and is the backbone of 
the scheme which runs underneath the town.
Outlook for 2018
To further build on the NMCNomenca foundation and 
operational model, the amalgamation of the Civil Engineering 
business into NMCNomenca will allow the continued delivery of 
non-regulatory projects.
• We have good visibility of Severn Trent Water’s programme of 
work going forward 
• Major Schemes Pipeline of work is well under way with a 
number of projects currently being tracked and tendered
• Fully incorporating Civil Engineering into the division to deliver 
major schemes
• Continuing with the AMP7 procurement process for Severn 
Trent Water

Nomenca Division
We have achieved our turnover 
target and have instigated 
improvement plans across the 
division to improve our financial 
performance, to which we have 
seen a positive impact. 
Overall segment performance
Due to improved order input in the second half of 2017 we have 
achieved our turnover of £55m. We instigated improvement 
plans across the division to improve our financial performance, 
to which we have seen a positive impact and the leadership 
team remain focused on continuous improvement. It is also 
heartening to note that we have seen a significant improvement 
in debtor day performance.
Prompted by a sustained increase in workload in the 
Yorkshire area we relocated our regional Yorkshire office to a 
larger complex in Normanton, south east Leeds. The facility 
comprises two-storey offices and warehouse, centrally located 
in our client’s region, and will accommodate the ongoing team 
expansion.  
To support company growth, we have also welcomed a new 
member to the Nomenca Board: Gavin Stonard, as Engineering 
Director. Gavin will lead and develop our technical services 
offering internally and externally and develop our full asset life 
cycle capabilities to provide a holistic asset life cycle service to 
our customers. 
Our significant award wins for this year include the British 
Construction Industry Application of Technology Award 2017 
for an Affinity Water Project. The pioneering Off Site Build 
Modular approach to a potable water treatment and pumping 
station upgrade minimised asset downtime, disruption and 
overall programme. We combined virtual design technology 
with modular offsite manufacturing – shifting the mainstay of 
the construction work to a controlled factory environment. The 
achievement is testament to our entire team including design, 
engineering and operations.  
Outlook for 2018
We will look to continually enhance the current business to 
serve the UK Water Industry and other similar industries by:
• Focusing on providing additional technical services across all 
business streams
• Embedding a Factory Thinking process within the current 
frameworks
• Delivering further efficiency for clients and stakeholders

Group structure
Our operational activities are divided into six operating divisions 
working in five distinct market sectors (our segments). Each 
segment has a clear, focused offering to the customers that 
they serve. These divisions have the skills and experience to 
meet the needs of our customers and work effectively in these 
markets. This allows them to provide expert contribution and 
innovation to achieve added value to the work streams. From 
1 January 2018 the Civils division will be absorbed into the 
NMCNomenca division, which in turn forms part of the Water 
segment. From 1 January 2018 the Board will review the 
Group’s operational performance via two segments: the Water 
segment (NMCNomenca and Nomenca divisions) and the Built 
Environment segment (Telecommunications, Highways and 
Construction divisions).
Overview of 2017
This year has been a period of continuing to strengthen the 
business in preparation for a sustainable growth in quality of 
earnings and respectable dividend yields. Further significant 
investment has been made in implementing governance 
controls to manage risk and into the development of our 
people to meet the increasing demands of our customers for a 
high-quality service.
The Group is now well positioned to take advantage of the 
increase in infrastructure spending plans that prevail. The net 
return is disappointing and has been significantly impacted by 
the remaining legacy contract. The underlying profitability, cash 
generation and secured workload for 2018 are the significant 
positives which give the Board confidence for the Group’s 
future.

The underlying profitability in the 
year of £8.30 million is a significant 
increase on the previous year.
Overall co-ordination of our activities is carried out through 
the Executive Leadership Team (ELT) which is chaired by the 
Chief Executive. Membership consists of the Finance Director, 
Directors of the divisions and the central services functions.
The overarching purpose of this body is to ensure consistency 
of best practice and to drive performance improvement across 
all of our activities.
Group financial performance
The growth in turnover of 16.48% to £291.77 million (2016: 
£250.49 million) is encouraging and is borne from our vision of 
growing revenues in our chosen markets with our repeat and 
framework clients. It is also very encouraging to see the level 
of new customers and enquiries in 2017 achieved through the 
quality of customer experience that the Group delivers.
Although not at the level the Board finds acceptable, an 
operating profit of £1.19 million (2016: £2.24 million) has been 
achieved in the year. The underlying profitability in the year of 
£8.30 million (2016: £5.91 million) is a significant increase on 
the previous year and shows the exceptional performance, in 
the main, of the continuing business segments. The impact 
of the legacy contract has once again reduced the net margin 
return as highlighted in the Group Statement of Comprehensive 
Income and on page 91.
The current tax debit of £0.26 million (2016: £0.57 million 
credit) arises due to current tax on profits at 19.25% in addition 
to a reduction in the deferred tax rate applicable to taxable 
temporary differences. Total comprehensive income for the year 
has reduced to £0.74 million (2016: £2.63 million) and in turn 
earnings per share has reduced to 7.31p (2016: 25.95p).
The Board is proposing to retain the final dividend at 3.0p, 
taking the total dividend for the year to 6.0p (2016: 4.5p). 
The total dividend is only covered 1.22 times (2016: 5.80 
times) and has been proposed as an exceptional dividend, as 
per the Group’s dividend policy, and is due to the underlying 
performance of the Group, the cash generation and the 
secured workload for 2018. The Board anticipates an improving 
performance for 2018 and beyond.
Legacy contracts are construction contracts entered into at the 
height of the recession, before 31 December 2013, and which 
carried a high contractual and commercial risk. These contracts 
have negatively impacted the Group’s income statement in 
2013 and subsequent years. As at 31 December 2017, there is 
only one legacy contract remaining.
In the year to 31 December 2017, the total loss before tax 
recognised on legacy contracts was £7.29 million (2016: 
£3.85 million). During the year to 31 December 2016 the 
Group completed all onsite works for the one remaining legacy 
contract, thereby removing any further uncertainty around costs 
to fulfil the contract.
Contract revenue on the one remaining legacy contract has 
been recognised based on the prudent best estimate of the 
Directors as at 31 December 2017 of the amount recoverable 
from the client, with an amount outstanding included within 
trade receivables. Following a High Court ruling towards the 
end of 2017, which did not support the application of the well-
established 'prevention principle' in relation to this contract, the 
Company has been granted leave to appeal this decision by 
the Court of Appeal. On the advice of the Company’s lawyers 
the Directors will vigorously pursue this appeal, but have 
decided to make a further provision against the outstanding 
debt. This matter will be kept under constant review and 
further announcements will be made if appropriate. The Group 
is and will be pursuing claims with the client for sums greater 
than the carrying value. The Directors have sought to make 
the estimate as precise as possible by reflecting the views of 
independent quantum and legal experts who were appointed 
by the Directors for their ability, qualifications and experience in 
this field.
The independent quantum and legal experts, in conjunction 
with management, considered a number of factors when 
making their assessment, such as contractual terms, work 
performed, claims for variations, submissions for extensions of 
time, claims for loss and expense and expected time frames in 
which settlement is likely.
Whilst the Directors are making every effort to seek a swift 
resolution to the matter, they are committed to achieving the 
best possible result for the Group. The ultimate settlement of 
this matter may take in excess of 12 months to achieve. Further 
details of the legacy contract can be found on page 100.
Group financial position
It is very pleasing to report that our key strategic focus around 
driving cash is evident in the increase in the year end cash 
balance of £17.01 million (2016: £11.41 million). The Group 
has integrated further visibility for the divisions, highlighting 
the importance of cash and improved discipline around cash 
collection and upfront agreement of contractual terms.

Financial  
Review
This has meant that despite the 16.48% increase in revenue 
the Group has reduced the average credit period taken by 
its customers to 32 days (2016: 33 days), leading to a slight 
outflow of cash across construction contracts and trade and 
other receivables of £0.64 million (2016: £0.94 million). The 
average credit period taken on credit purchases has also 
reduced to 43 days (2016: 52 days) due to shorter terms being 
offered to maintain the best supply chain and achieve the most 
commercial pricing. The inflow of cash of £7.58 million (2016: 
£4.56 million) due to the increase in trade and other payables to 
£68.72 million (2016: £61.15 million) is also due to the increase 
in revenue and increase in cash collection in the fourth quarter, 
giving a higher other taxes and social security costs creditor of 
£6.73 million (2016: £4.67 million). The Group ensures it has a 
sustainable working capital mix to support our growth across 
all contracts and segments and has secured increased banking 
facilities in early 2018 to allow us to do this. We are also 
targeting reducing creditor payment terms further to allow our 
supply chain to grow with us.
It is also pleasing to report that the net cash has increased 
to £12.04 million (2016: £7.43 million) which is due to the 
increase in cash above and despite an increase in finance 
lease borrowings. As a result of the Group’s growth the net 
investment during the year on property, plant and equipment 
increased to £2.90 million (2016: £1.30 million), in line with the 
Company’s strategy to purchase equipment where possible, 
rather than expense through operating leases. Following this 
investment in capital assets the closing net book value of non-
current assets stood at £17.12 million (2016: £13.65 million), 
which positions the Group to deliver its targeted growth through 
2018 and beyond.
Outlook
The UK construction industry is struggling to keep up with the 
demand to maintain the existing infrastructure and the need for 
investment to support future economic growth. The Group has 
established positions in these markets and is well situated to 
take advantage of the potential for further growth. 
In excess of 90% of our 2018 turnover has already been 
secured and it is expected that the balance will be achieved 
from carefully selected projects during the first half of this year.
We remain confident in the outlook for the Group and expect 
the positive progress achieved to continue into 2018 and 
beyond.

Our  
Risks
Introduction 
NM Group’s approach to risk management is guided by its core 
values, strategic priorities and related objectives. It regards its 
risk attitude as the amount of risk that it is willing to accept in 
order to deliver its strategic priorities.
The Board recognises the importance of risk in the running of 
its business, that circumstances are continuously changing and 
that the risks therefore need to remain under regular review.
The Board has made a robust assessment of the principal 
risks which the Group faces, the controls in place to remove 
or mitigate these risks and also whether these risks represent 
new, increased or decreased threats. The assessment of these 
risks and controls is part of the ongoing management of the 
business.
The principal risks that could adversely impact the Group’s 
profitability and ability to achieve its strategic objectives are set 
out in the table on pages 40 to 43.
Risk Management Framework
Operating in the construction industry, risk is at the heart of 
everything we do. We therefore have well-embedded risk and 
control processes in place to manage both material and day-to-
day circumstances.
2017 saw the continuing strengthening of the risk management 
culture and disciplines embedding the Group’s strategic 
priorities and related objectives.
The Group recognises that consistent and effective risk 
management is vital to the delivery of its strategic development 
and business objectives.
The Group’s risk and governance model is designed so that 
the Board maintains overall responsibility for risk. Each division 
identifies controls and mitigates threats within their operations. 
The reporting structure ensures that once the risk appetite is 
determined by the Board, risks are managed within acceptable 
tolerance levels.
Senior managers within the divisions take ownership of specific 
business risks.
Risk is managed across the Group in the following ways:
• The Group and its divisions undertake a comprehensive 
annual business planning process to identify objectives and 
set strategies to achieve their goals taking account of the risk 
appetite set by the Board. A SMART plan is developed by the 
divisions and the central Group functions.
• The Chief Executive and Finance Director meet with the 
divisions monthly throughout the year and with an established 
agenda and reporting format covering a range of matters. 
This allows the Chief Executive and Finance Director to 
ensure that they maintain oversight and control over the 
material aspects of strategic, financial, operational and risk 
issues.
• Tendering opportunities, including pre qualification 
questionnaires and framework submissions, are assessed 
based on the strategic objectives of the divisions. 
Governance levels are set according to risk appetite, but 
includes significant involvement from the Chief Executive and 
Finance Director.
• The Group’s Audit Committee is responsible for monitoring 
and ensuring that the internal commercial audit remains 
efficient and effective. The committee annually approves the 
internal commercial audit plan which covers both project and 
corporate level risks. The plan is developed by focusing upon 
the principal risks identified from the risk review process and 
feedback from current divisional performance. The internal 
commercial audit team reports regularly to the Board and the 
Audit Committee on its findings.
• The Group has a number of initiatives under way to 
continually strengthen the risk management of the Group 
and acceptance and delivery of individual contracts. These 
include tender review procedures, programme development 
and early supply chain involvement. These projects are being 
driven from the Group’s Commercial Forum and the Executive 
Leadership Team.

Going Concern and Viability Statement 
The Strategic Report on pages 08 to 53 sets out details of the 
Group’ s marketplace, business model and Group strategy, 
as well as an overview of divisional strategy, including both 
operational and financial performance. Further information on 
the key performance indicators, principal risks and material 
uncertainties affecting NM Group can be found on pages 26 
to 27 and 38 to 43. Starting on page 38, the risk disclosures 
section of the consolidated financial statements sets out the 
principal risks the Group is exposed to, including people, 
performance, and financial compliance, together with the 
Group’ s policies for monitoring, managing and mitigating its 
exposures to these risks.
The Board considers annually and on a rolling basis a 
three-year strategic plan for the business which the Group 
progressively implements. The three-year strategic plan was 
last approved by the Board on 13 December 2017. One of the 
strengths of the Group is the number of long-term frameworks 
secured and repeat business with blue chip clients. This gives 
a longer-term sustainable baseline of work, which the Board 
deems to be of a lower risk profile, and this is in line with the 
longer-term strategy of the Group.
During 2017, the Board carried out a robust assessment of 
the principal risks facing the Group, including those that would 
threaten its business model, future performance, solvency or 
liquidity. The Directors believe that the Group is well placed to 
manage its business risks successfully in the current economic 
climate.
Accordingly, the Board believes that, taking into account the 
Group’ s current position, and subject to the principal risks 
faced by the business, the Group will be able to continue in 
operation and to meet its liabilities as they fall due for the period 
up to 31 December 2020, being the period considered under 
the Group’ s current three-year strategic plan.
The financial forecasts included in the strategic plan have 
been subjected to stress testing using the following potential 
occurrences:
• Reduction in creditor payment cycle
• AMP cycle revenue downturn (within the Water segment)
• Reduced margin or potential loss-making contracts
• Potential failure in supply chain
As part of the strategic plan, the Board has reviewed its capital 
structure and any requirement for additional financing during 
the period to 31 December 2020. After making enquiries, the 
Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group has 
adequate resources to continue its operational existence for 
the foreseeable future and for a period of at least 12 months 
from the date of this report. Accordingly, the Board continues 
to adopt and consider appropriate the going concern basis in 
preparing the Annual Report and Accounts.

Economic
The macroeconomic environment 
within the United Kingdom after 
Brexit is riddled with inherent 
uncertainty
The result of the EU referendum 
has the potential to distort some of 
our markets
The recent weakening of the pound 
adds increased market pressures 
from a product and supply chain 
perspective
 
• Increased visibility with our 
supply chain on any forecast 
pricing awareness and issues
• Long term frameworks that 
include increases in inflation

uncertainty around the UK 
economy in general which 
is where the majority

Government
A reduction in Government 
spending on infrastructure projects 
would directly affect some of the 
Group’s divisions. Whilst long 
term frameworks, in particular in 
the water businesses, give some 
level of protection a proportion of 
our turnover requires continued 
expenditure at a national and local 
level.
• We operate our business 
through six diverse operating 
divisions, reducing our 
exposure to one particular 
market
• We have a broad customer 
base and geographic spread
• We manage our exposure to 
cyclical downturns through

Health and Safety
The reduction in our AFR for 2017 
is testament to the strategy we 
implemented over the course of the 
year, combined with the hard work 
of all our people.
2017 Achievements:
• Reduction in AFR 
• Successful cultural safety survey with high respondent rate
• 15% Reduction in service strikes
• 7 Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents (RoSPA) 
Occupational Health and Safety Awards 2017 across the 
Group
We are proud to report a reduction in our AFR for 2017. This is 
testament to the strategy we implemented over the course of 
the year, combined with the hard work of all our people and the 
sharing of safety resource across regions. The cross-fertilisation 
of knowledge and gaining experience over a variety of 
construction activities has seen significant benefit to the Group 
in tackling this issue. Our 15% reduction in service strikes is 
very encouraging, with damage rates decreasing coupled with 
a significant reduction in incidents in the last four months of the 
year. We will continue this positive progress. 
On a yearly basis we undertake the Health and Safety 
Laboratory (HSL) Safety Climate Survey which had a response 
rate of 75.2%; a great result. From the data collected we 
have the following results, all of which are above the HSL’s 
benchmark score and show a reduction in our unfavourable 
percentage across our key eight areas of measurement, 
indicating that our culture is continuously improving:
Overall organisation commitment – 74.9%; Health and Safety 
oriented behaviours – 59.4%; trust in Health and Safety – 
65.3%; procedures overall – 40.6%; engagement – 71.2%; 
overall peer group attitude – 70.0%; Health and Safety 
resources – 69.1%; accident and near miss reporting – 62.8%.
By way of recognition, both NM Group and the Nomenca 
division achieved the RoSPA President's award having gained 
more than ten consecutive Gold awards in the prestigious 
annual scheme. NMCNomenca won their 8th gold award with 
the Building, Civil Engineering, Highways and Utilities divisions 
all winning their 7th consecutive gold award. 
Targets for coming year: 
• Deliver Zero RIDDOR and Zero Harm
• Implementation of a Health and Wellbeing framework 
incorporating quarterly wellbeing initiatives
• Reduce All Accident Frequency Rate (AAFR)
• Reduce Lost Time Incidents (LTI)

STRATEGIC REPORT Focusing on our Employee 
Experience 
Within our business strategy on page 23 we highlighted our 
focus on Employee Experience. The progress made in 2017 
will lead us into an exciting 2018 for all our people.
We have examined how we can further assist our people 
outside of the workplace, which includes an extension of our 
established “perks at work” platform. We have engaged with 
a reputable provider to harness opportunities to provide our 
people with long term wellbeing support: physical, mental and 
financial. This includes the provision of tools and opportunities 
for guidance and support with life assurance, private medical 
and dental cover. In addition, we are easing the facilitation 
of retirement through a digital platform and face to face 
workshops.
We believe that by minimising potential outside personal 
concerns, our people will be more focused, engaged and 
productive.

Our work with the Prison Service 
We are working on a new and exciting project with the HM 
Prison Service, to encourage and support the rehabilitation 
and re-skilling of offenders; creating a positive impact on our 
wider communities and addressing the skills gap that we face. 
Currently the construction industry will require an additional 
36,000 workers a year to cover current project demand.    
Our Community Liaison Advisor Amber Moore is working with 
HMP Ranby, in Nottingham, having implemented our NM 
Academy programme within the prison. Currently nine men 
have embarked on a Level 2 Diploma in Construction and Civil 
Engineering Services. The programme is designed to offer 
construction specific training, health and safety excellence and 
employability skills.  
This very exciting project is set to embed throughout 2018 with 
a further three cohorts. We will interview each of the men upon 
completion, with the aim to recruit them into the Group or the 
wider supply chain.

Directors and two (2016: two) women included within key 
management (note 29). The Group employs 159 women (2016: 
128) in total. 
Attract and Recruit
We have had a proactive and successful recruitment drive 
throughout 2017 totalling 471 new people across a broad 
range of roles from apprentices to experienced and technical 
specialist professionals. 
We have a continuous pipeline of talent to serve our customers 
and to build a stronger and more innovative Group. We will 
continue to create exciting opportunities and maintain our 
positive reputation in the marketplace to be attractive to 
prospective employees. This is the basis of our coaching and 
learning culture. 
Our proactive approach to recruitment saw recognition of our 
success by being awarded as a finalist in the Construction 
Investing in Talent Awards in the Recruitment Team of the Year 
category. The awards recognised the work our team has done 
to increase direct referrals, reduce agency spend and minimise 
the cost per recruit.
Engage and Develop
We continue to build on the success of our NM Academy with 
work experience opportunities, apprenticeships, fully funded 
degree programmes, placements for undergraduate students, 
graduate opportunities and leadership and management 
workshops. This is coupled with our overarching “Employee 
Experience”, to allow us to strive to provide all our people with the 
best experience. We enhance this further by reviewing our reward 
and recognition strategy through providing the right working 
environment and a suite of benefits that complement our industry.
The need for development of middle managers without a 
formal qualification has been identified in some areas of 
the business. Our new “Leadership Essentials” training 
programme is a short course incorporating elements from our 
ILM 3 and 5 modules. The training consists of understanding 
leadership styles and self awareness, time management, 
planning and prioritisation, motivating and engaging teams 
with performance management through coaching, health and 
safety excellence and customer service, driving for results and 
effective communication. 
We have also been recognised for two further awards this 
year, based on our leadership and commitment to people 
development, a testament to us creating a sustainable 
workforce across the Group.
Firstly, Stuart Proud – NMCNomenca Managing Director 
and Board Director – was a finalist in the Investors in People 
(IIP) Awards in the Leader of the Year (500+) category. This 
was in recognition of his leadership qualities, commitment to 
people development, mentorship to key individuals within the 
Group and the impact his approach has had on the overall 
performance of the operating division led by him. 
Secondly, we reached the final of the East Midlands Chamber 
Awards in the Commitment to People Development category. 
We were recognised for the important part our people play 
in attaining our objectives and our approach to learning and 
development. 
Targets for the coming year: 
• Leadership Briefing survey feedback net promoter score to 
increase 
• Implementation of Health and Wellbeing framework 
incorporating quarterly wellbeing initiatives 
• Communication: audit and workshops with a focus on 
engagement
• NM Academy: commence the journey to formalise a 
structured graduate programme, provide middle manager 
development, maintain succession planning and embed the 
HM Prison Service offender learning programme.

Our customer & supply chain: 
Supply services and products to 
an exceptional standard
Customer Experience
Looking beyond contractual 
obligations has allowed us to 
fully align ourselves with wider 
stakeholder expectations.
2017 Achievements: 
• Development of iCEP panel 
• Finalised our customer promise
• Increase in customer engagement surveys
Customer experience has a direct impact on all areas of our 
strategy: repeat business and profitability, our brand perception 
and is our differentiator in the competitive markets in which 
we operate. As an essential element of our business, we are 
pleased to report on our progress over the year. 
During 2017 we finalised our customer promise aligned with our 
vision and values: 
“It is everybody’s responsibility at NM Group to deliver an 
exceptional customer service. We must all strive to create a 
positive experience in everything we do.”
• We will always be polite, courteous and professional, treating 
all of our customers how we’d like to be treated
• We will take ownership and escalate any issues we can’t 
resolve
• We will keep our customers updated
• We will commit to deliver our projects right first time, every time
• We will commit to support the areas in which we work for the 
benefit of the community
Our promise has been rolled out across the business through 
our Leadership Briefings so that everyone can understand the 
part that they play in the customer journey, regardless of their 
role within our Group. Customer promise cards are included 
within all our operational job packs to serve as a daily reminder 
of our commitments with an additional programme of Toolbox 
Talks focusing on the subject. 
By streamlining our approach to complaint handling we have 
implemented better measurement tools and processes to deal 
with queries that arise via email, phone and social media. We 
welcome the feedback to continually improve our business. 
Through effectively tracking and analysing the data collected 
we can see a positive impact. This has been supplemented by 
conducting reviews across all divisions as to how we measure 
customer satisfaction. 
We are also communicating better than ever with our 
stakeholders through our latest expectation and satisfaction 
methodology. Looking beyond contractual obligations has 
allowed us to fully align ourselves with their expectations and 
review these over the course of delivery. Once again, the 
feedback we have received has allowed us to drive change 
in our business through best practice sharing and even into 
individual development plans. 
Targets for coming year: 
• Increased customer engagement through expectation and 
satisfaction communication
• Video learning library for customer promise messaging
• Developing our customer experience training
• Customer journey mapping

Supply Chain
Our supply chain relationship 
management continues to be 
a balance of managing supply 
chain risk, maintaining value and 
efficiency, bringing innovation and 
removing waste. 
2017 Achievements:
• Promotion and enhancing of our collaborative working 
standard BS11000
• Continuous improvement of supply chain relationship 
management
• NM Group Market Place portal to enable suppliers to view 
our programme of work. 
Our supply chain and procurement (SC&P) team support the 
Group to balance efficient procurement and supply chain 
relationship management (SRM) with our vision remaining: 
“We believe that tomorrow’s competitive advantage will be 
borne out of the value and innovations created as a result of 
the way we construct and manage our supply chain today”.
Working in conjunction with the operational and commercial 
teams, SC&P promote the collaborative working standard 
BS 11000 (with the ongoing transition to ISO 44001) and 
associated SRM techniques such as single source contracts 
and collaborative planning. Our SRM continues to be a balance 
of managing supply chain risk, maintaining value and efficiency, 
bringing innovation and removing waste. This is only possible 
by working more closely and collaboratively with our chosen 
partners. 
We have successfully implemented our new Market Place 
portal which is part of our open working methodology. Our 
Market Place allows our partners to view our rolling programme 
of work from tender award to latest progress on site giving clear 
visibility of workload.
We continue to hold our annual Supply Chain Forum in support 
of our collaborative working approach. The 2017 event 
was attended by more than 150 people, with suppliers and 
subcontractors from across the country given an exclusive 
insight into our strategic developments and innovations by 
Directors and senior management. Break out sessions feature 
as part of the day to discuss key issues facing the engineering 
and construction sector and what action should be taken by 
the industry. This year focused on the industry “skills gap”. 
Apprenticeships, increased government support, industry 
attractiveness and learning from the manufacturing industry 
were all highly regarded as options for bridging the gap. 
The event also includes annual awards for members of our 
supply chain network who display excellence in Quality, Health 
and Safety, Innovation and Performance and Customer Service. 
Targets for coming year: 
• Strategic change agenda: efficiencies, cost reduction, 
enabling smarter working
• Enhancing supply chain relationships
• Risk management
• Ongoing transition to ISO 44001 – Collaborative Business 
Relationship Management
• Extending Collaborative Business Relationship working with 
the Supply Chain 
• Effective benchmarking and communication of SC&P vision 
and future plans

We are proud to make a positive impact within our projects 
from a sustainable project and construction perspective. Our 
people are as equally dedicated to local environmental and 
community causes during the year. Each region has made 
a commitment to make a positive impact within their local 
community. Examples include:
• Our QESH team have been involved in local impromptu 
litter picks within the vicinity of our head office during 
their lunch hour. This has become a regular event with 
increasing participation, showing a commitment to the local 
environment.
• Volunteer days with the Trent Rivers Trust and Nottingham 
County Council have also proved popular. Vegetation 
clearance over the course of these days has made a 
significant difference for both community and wildlife. The 
Rivers Trust representatives were very impressed with how 
our volunteers embraced the activities.
• During 2017 we have made donations to 87 different 
causes, including sponsoring local football teams, donating 
to national charities and supporting members of our team 
completing challenging events.

TomTom Technology
We have significantly invested in the upgrade and utilisation of 
our TomTom technology. Now we are able to monitor, report 
and manage our fleet more effectively than ever before through:
• Vehicle tracking: Daily summary reports and detailed trip 
reports allow us to view how efficient our vehicles are on the 
road. From this we can implement changes to continuously 
improve. It allows us to view usage times, driving times, 
duration and standstill times.
• Green and safe driving: OptiDrive 360 allows us to monitor 
speeding, harsh steering or sudden braking, idle time, 
fuel consumption, constant speed, coasting, green speed 
and gear shift. Our vehicles are speed limited which has 
significantly improved our efficiency. The real time reporting 
provides us with an insight into our entire fleet, spotting 
trends and anomalies with fuel efficiency.
Targets for coming year: 
• Zero environmental incidents (year on year)
• Continuing our 50% reduction in carbon footprint strategy
• Increased environmental awareness
• Waste reduction – emphasis on planning and embed a core 
principle of zero waste to landfill.

Robert Moyle | Chairman
Remuneration Committee also met five times during the year. 
All required Directors were present at each meeting to have 
quorum. The Board has a formal schedule of matters reserved 
solely for it to decide which includes responsibility for the overall 
Group strategy.
In advance of all Board Meetings a Board pack is circulated to 
Board members informing them of all relevant matters.
There is a well-established budgeting and reporting function, 
with budgets and results reviewed by the Board providing 
a timely and regular monitoring of financial performance. All 
capital expenditure is approved by the Board only after a 
thorough evaluation process.
The Directors have undertaken a formal and rigorous evaluation 
of their performance for the year ended 31 December 2017. 
The results have been reviewed by the Board, led by the 
Chairman and discussed with individual Directors, except that 
the performance of the Chairman was reviewed by the Non-
Executive Directors, led by the Senior Independent Director.
The Board has an agreed procedure for Directors to take 
independent professional advice in the furtherance of their 
duties, should they so require.
The appointment of Non-Executive Directors is led by the 
Nomination Committee, which comprises the Executive 
Chairman and existing Non-Executive Directors. The Committee 
evaluates the skills and experience of potential Non-Executive 
Directors and makes recommendations to the Board. Further 
details can be found in the Nomination Committee report on 
page 65.
The Group is committed to high standards of Corporate 
Governance. This statement describes how the relevant 
principles of governance are applied to the Company.
For the year ended 31 December 2017 the Directors confirm 
that the Company has taken appropriate steps to comply with 
the provisions of “The UK Corporate Governance Code” and 
with the provisions of the Disclosure and Transparency Rules 
on Audit Committees and Corporate Governance statements 
(DTR 7).
The Principles of Good Governance
The Board of Directors, under its Chairman, R Moyle, consists 
of five Executives, all highly experienced in the construction 
industry, and three independent Non-Executive members. 
Details of their biographies can be found on pages 56 and 57.
The Non-Executive Directors have no financial or contractual 
interest in the Company other than by way of their fees 
and shareholdings and are considered independent of the 
Company. J Homer is the Chief Executive, whose role includes 
all the general duties and responsibilities of the daily functions 
of running a public company. The Senior Independent Director 
is SJT Brown, who has served for thirteen years, and the Non-
Executive Director Mr I Elliott has served for eleven years. The 
Nomination Committee has rigorously reviewed their position 
and independence in line with the code. Mr SJT Brown and Mr 
I Elliott have offered themselves up for re-election.
The Board met formally, as a whole, eight times during the year 
and the Audit Committee met four times during the year. The 
59 North Midland Construction PLC Annual Report and Accounts for the year ended 31 December 2017
GOVERNANCE 25748  5 April 2018 11:24 AM  Proof 14
All Directors are required to submit themselves for re-election at 
least once every three years. 
Accountability and Review
The Board is fully aware of its duty to present a balanced 
and understandable assessment of the Group’s position and 
prospects, and this is included in the Chairman’s Statement and 
Strategic Report.
The Board has overall responsibility for the Group’s systems of 
internal financial control, and for monitoring their effectiveness. 
The system of internal controls is designed to manage rather 
than eliminate the risk of business failure, to achieve business 
objectives and can only provide reasonable not absolute 
assurance against material misstatement or loss. The Directors 
have established an organisation structure with clear operating 
procedures, lines of responsibility and delegated authority within 
the limitations of the size of the business. These controls are 
established in order to safeguard the Group’s assets, maintain 
proper accounting records and ensure that financial information 
used within the business, or published, is reliable.
The risk management processes were in place for the full year 
to 31 December 2017 and up to the date of approval of this 
report. The procedures are constantly reviewed throughout 
the year along with the operational risks across the Group and 
prioritisation of those risks identified for further action. This is 
carried out primarily at a management level and reported up to 
the Board.
The Board has not undertaken a formal annual review of the 
effectiveness of the internal controls. The size of the Company 
and the close involvement of the Executive Directors ensures a 
sound system of internal control is maintained.
Going Concern
Based on normal business planning and control procedures 
the Directors confirm that the Company and the Group have 
adequate resources to continue in operational existence for 
the foreseeable future. Accordingly, they continue to adopt the 
going concern basis in preparing the financial statements. 
The Board regularly reviews financial statements, cash balances 
and forecasts to ensure that the going concern state of affairs 
continues to prevail.
Audit Committee
The Board has constituted an Audit Committee, which 
comprises three independent Non-Executive Directors, Mr SJT 
Brown (Chairman), Mr I Elliott and Mr DP Rogers. The Board is 
satisfied that they have recent and relevant financial experience 
to analyse, and when necessary to challenge, the information 
contained in, or the presentation of, management accounts and 
statutory financial statements. The Chairman, Chief Executive 
and the Finance Director attend Committee meetings for 
specific purposes at the agreement of the Committee.
The Committee is responsible for reviewing the nature and 
scope of the external audit and the results of that audit, any 
internal control issues raised by them and management 
responses. In addition, the Committee reviews the 
independence and objectivity of the external Auditor. BDO LLP 
currently carries out routine tax compliance work (see note 8 
for fees charged). The Committee takes the view that carrying 
out this non-audit work does not affect BDO LLP’s objectivity or 
independence, given the extent of fees charged for non-audit 
services, and it does not fall within the definition of ‘accounting 
services’. The review of interim and annual financial statements 
and the appointment and remuneration of the external Auditor 
are considered by the Board as a whole.
During the year the Committee met on four occasions and all 
members were present. The external Auditor was invited and 
attended these meetings.
Relations with Shareholders
The Company is predominantly a family-owned business and 
has only a small number of institutional shareholders. The 
Board endeavours to maintain dialogue with its shareholders 
by means of periodic financial reporting via Trading updates, 
as required by the UK Listing Authority’s Disclosure and 
Transparency Rules, Interim results at the half year, the 
Annual Report and at Annual General Meetings. Details of 
these together with related press releases are available at the 
Company’s website (www.northmid.co.uk).
Code of Best Practice
Throughout the year ended 31 December 2017 the Company 
has been compliant with the UK Corporate Governance Code 
issued by the Financial Reporting Council in the UK, with the 
exception of the matters referred to below, which arise solely 
due to the size of the Company and the burden of increased 
costs should the Company wish to comply.
DA Taylor is the Company Secretary, a role he combines with 
his responsibilities as Finance Director.
The Audit Committee has reviewed the necessity and value 
of an internal commercial audit function and agreed the 
continuation of the project monitoring programme in relation to 
commercial and contractual risk on contracts. The Company 
is utilising internal expertise from across divisions to deliver 
the internal commercial audit function, which adds to the 
development of the employees involved and encourages best 
practice across all divisions. The committee continually reviews 
the requirement for internal audit by an external body.

Audit Committee  
Report
Steve Brown | Non-Executive Chairman, Audit Committee
This year we have hopefully put together a report which is 
transparent yet concise and shows not only what we have 
done but how we did it in 2017.
Who are we?
The Audit Committee is made up of three independent Non-
Executive Directors, Ian Elliott, David Rogers and myself, Steve 
Brown. Our biographies, qualifications and experience are 
included on page 57.
Our purpose
The key purpose of the Audit Committee is to monitor and 
review the formal arrangements established by the Board in 
respect of:
• the financial reporting and narrative reporting of the Group;
• the effectiveness of the internal controls and the risk 
management framework;
• whistleblowing;
• internal commercial audit and project monitoring process; 
and
• the external audit process.
What we did during the year
• Review of interim and final financial statements, and 
announcements relating to the financial performance of the 
Group. 
• Examination of the internal control processes within the 
Group and, in particular, how those have been implemented 
since the integration of a number of divisions and the 
potential growth opportunities the Group has.
• Recommending the reappointment of the external Auditor, 
agreeing the scope of their work and their remuneration, and 
reviewing their effectiveness and independence. 
• Reviewing the reports and opinions of the external experts 
that have been used in the preparation of the financial 
statements. In particular, in relation to significant claim 
recovery relating to the legacy contract.
• Agreeing the continuing scope of works of an internal 
commercial audit programme, or known internally as 
contract ‘project monitoring’. Review of any opportunities 
for improvement, ensuring that any process changes are 
embedded.
• Examining the key financial processes and procedures in 
place at a higher level to alleviate error and/or potential fraud 
and protect the Group’s assets.

Financial Reporting Council letter
The Company received a letter from the Financial Reporting 
Council’s (FRC) Corporate Reporting Review Team on 
1 February 2017, asking certain questions about some 
disclosure matters in our annual report for the year ended 
31 December 2015. The Company responded fully to the 
matters raised in the FRC’s letter, enabling it to conclude its 
enquiry. As a result of the FRC’s enquiry, the Company has 
made improvements to the disclosures in this annual report in 
the following areas:
• the effect of “legacy contracts” on business performance in 
both the strategic report and the financial statements;
• the analysis of the business’ development, performance and 
financial position in the strategic report; and
• the disclosures in respect of any significant accounting 
judgements and sources of estimation uncertainty arising in 
respect of construction contracts in the financial statements.
The FRC’s enquiry did not result in any change to reported 
profit or net assets.
We recognise that the FRC’s review was based on a review 
of our annual report for the year ended 31 December 2015 
and did not benefit from detailed knowledge of the Company’s 
business or an understanding of the underlying transactions 
entered into. Its review did not provide any assurance that the 
Company’s annual report and financial statements are correct in 
all material respects.
The committee also noted that the only significant item raised 
as part of the FRC’s Audit Quality Review of the external 
audit concerned the one remaining legacy contract and the 
disclosures in respect of any significant accounting judgements 
and sources of estimation uncertainty arising in respect of 
construction contracts in the financial statements.
External audit 
The Committee formally met with the external Auditor, BDO 
LLP , during the year end process to discuss the nature and 
scope of the audit, to review (in some detail) the audit plan and 
lastly to review the outcome of the audit and to discuss issues 
arising and their resolution.
When meeting with the Auditor we reviewed the Group’s 
accounting policies to ensure that they remained appropriate 
and discussed in broad terms the major risks that the Auditor 
was likely to consider during their work. These are set out 
in the Auditor’s own report, but included profits recognised 
on contracts, recoverability of trade receivables, and going 
concern. We also discussed fees, which are set out in note 8, 
and all other relationships which may have a bearing on the 
Auditor’s independence.
We also discussed the judgements and uncertainties inherent in 
the preparation of the financial statements with the Auditor and 
how these areas were dealt with by the Group which are set out 
in note 4. These matters are as follows: 
Recognition of revenue and attributable profit (or losses) on 
contracts
The Auditor anticipated this to be an area of significant risk 
because the extent of revenue and profit or loss recognised on 
a partially completed contract represents an area of judgement. 
The Board, where necessary, has taken expert advice on 
the value of certain problematic contracts recognised in the 
financial statements. These experts have been used to give 
opinion on the legal substance and quantum measurement 
where appropriate. The Audit Committee reviewed and agreed 
with the use of such experts and the process the Board has 
undertaken to ensure that these contracts were reflected 
accurately in the financial statements.
Recoverability of construction contracts and trade 
receivables
The Auditor assessed the recoverability of trade receivables to 
be an area of significant risk as a result of the sector and the 
characteristics of the contracting environment.
The Board, where necessary, has taken expert advice on 
the value of certain problematic contracts recognised in the 
financial statements. These experts have been used to give 
opinion on the legal substance and quantum measurement 
where appropriate. The Audit Committee reviewed and agreed 
with the use of such experts and the process the Board has 
undertaken to ensure that these contracts were reflected 
accurately in the financial statements which are set out in 
note 4.
Audit plan 
The Committee agreed the audit plan with the Auditor, having 
paid particular regard to issues of scope and materiality. The 
Committee also agreed the external Auditor remuneration.
Annual report
We have discussed the presentation of the annual report, both 
in the context of the increasing acceptance of the concept 
of integrated reporting and also in view of the difficulties 
shareholders commented on in relation to the ever increasing 
complexity of the financial statements. 
62 North Midland Construction PLC Annual Report and Accounts for the year ended 31 December 2017 25748  5 April 2018 11:24 AM  Proof 14
Audit completion
The Committee also discussed expected losses due to the 
legacy contract and any unfavourable commercial settlements.
At our final meeting with the Auditor, prior to signing the annual 
report, we discussed the resolution of the risks that the Auditor 
had identified above.
The Audit Committee recognised and agreed with the Board’s 
use of external experts. The Audit Committee concluded that 
the experts (who are independent and drawn from a variety of 
relevant disciplines) have provided opinions on the legal merits 
and the quantum evaluations of the specific contracts. In the 
discharge of its duties, the Audit Committee has had regard to 
the expert opinions and the advice and guidance within them. It 
has also reviewed the processes which the Board has adopted 
to ensure that the specific contracts were properly reported 
in the Financial Statements, including that they accurately 
reflected the experts’ views.
Other fees paid to our external Auditor
In terms of non-audit services, these have been limited to tax 
compliance related to the audit and amounted to £12,000 
(2016: £11,000). All such activities have to be agreed by this 
Committee. We are satisfied, based on the level of fees and the 
use of separate departments, that the Auditor independence 
has been maintained.
Effectiveness of our Auditor
We are currently reviewing the effectiveness of the external 
Auditor. In doing so we plan to speak to the Finance Director, 
the Chief Executive, and a selection of the Group’s senior 
financial management within each business unit. We will ask 
them to complete a questionnaire, as we did last year, which 
will provide an objective scoring system around aspects of 
technical quality and of service quality. However, at this stage 
we remain satisfied that our Auditor is delivering an effective 
service on behalf of shareholders in terms of the necessary 
scrupulousness and challenge in their work, and also in terms 
of supporting the annual report process effectively. We shall 
continue to review this on an annual basis. BDO LLP have been 
our Auditor since 2010; there are no contractual obligations 
surrounding their appointment. Our last tender was in 2010, at 
which time our current auditor was first appointed.
Internal commercial audit
The Audit Committee feel that undertaking commercial and 
contractual peer reviews of certain contracts, known internally 
as contract ‘project monitoring’, is imperative to mitigate the 
inherent risk within the construction industry in which the Group 
operates. The Audit Committee continued a project monitoring 
programme in relation to commercial and contractual risk and 
this review will be enhanced to assess risk assessments prior 
to pricing of tenders. This aligns with the key strategic focus of 
preventing losses. The Company is utilising internal expertise 
from all divisions to deliver the internal commercial audit 
function. The reports produced are reviewed by the Committee 
during the year by exception. A summary of progress is issued 
at every Board meeting, along with a timetable for upcoming 
reviews. The Committee continually reviewed the requirement 
for internal audit by an external body.
Financial statements
The financial statements, and the annual report as a whole, 
are the responsibility of the entire Board. Their responsibility 
statement is contained in the Report of the Directors on page 
81, but the Board looks to the Audit Committee to advise it 
in relation to the financial statements both as regards their 
form and content, issues which might arise and on specific 
areas which require judgement, such as the going concern 
presumption. The Board believes the annual report, taken as a 
whole, is fair, balanced and understandable. 
In order to be able to advise the Board that the annual report 
is fair, balanced and understandable we spent some time 
deciding what we felt this meant and who our key stakeholders 
were and what this would mean for them. We decided that 
the annual report should be free from bias, tell the story of the 
Company for this financial year accurately and make sense to 
the reader. 
Going concern review 
The Committee review the going concern and viability position. 
Particular attention was given to both the liquidity and solvency 
position envisaged by the report for the period 12 months from 
this date and the foreseeable future as set out in the Board’s 
strategic plan.
Future plans 
We will of course continue to perform our duties as set out 
in our terms of reference over the course of the next year. 
However, there are a number of matters which we will be 
concentrating on as the year progresses, including: 
• A review of the effectiveness of the internal commercial audit 
function and potential enhancements to its scope; as well as 
a continual review of the requirement for internal audit by an 
external body; and
• A review of the effectiveness of the Audit Committee.

Membership 
The members of the Nomination Committee are Mr R Moyle 
(Executive Chairman of the Group and committee); Mr SJT 
Brown (Senior Non-Executive Director); Mr D Rogers (Non-

Remuneration  
Report
Although the maximum bonus potential for our annual bonus 
has been increased for 2018, we believe that our bonus plan 
remains appropriate. The increased potential under this bonus 
plan will only be delivered if future performance targets are 
achieved. As this plan is based primarily on profits before tax 
any additional incentive pay earned will be appropriately “self-
funded” as part of the attainment of the PBT targets.
Stepping back from the detail, we believe that our Executive 
Directors are very important to the continued development 
of NM Group, and particularly to the fulfilment of our ongoing 
growth plans. Accordingly, we believe that the changes which 
we have made for our Executive Directors will have a materially 
retentive impact and that the path which we are taking is clearly 
in shareholders’ best interests. 
For completeness, the salary for our Executive Chairman in 
2018 will remain unchanged from 2017 levels (2017: base 
salary £369,000). The Executive Chairman has waived 
his entitlement to an annual bonus for the year ended 31 
December 2017. He has also agreed not to be included in the 
annual bonus scheme from 1 January 2018 onwards.
Whilst not a matter for the Remuneration Committee, for 2018 
the Board has increased Non-Executive Directors’ fees to 
£40,000 for 2018 (2017: £36,000).
Shareholder approval
The regulations governing the directors’ remuneration reports 
of listed companies require that we split our report into two 
sections: a Policy Report which sets out the Company’s 
forward-looking Directors’ Remuneration Policy and a 
separate Implementation Report which gives details of the 
payments made to Directors in 2017, as well as other required 
disclosures.
As we are retaining our existing policy (for which Shareholder 
approval was obtained at the 2016 AGM), we will only be 
holding one vote on remuneration matters at the forthcoming 
AGM, that being an advisory vote on the Implementation 
Report.
I hope that you will continue to be supportive of our Executive 
remuneration policy and practices, and that you will vote in 
favour of the Implementation Report at the 2018 AGM.
On a final note, from 1 April 2018 I will be stepping down as 
Chairman of the Remuneration Committee but will remain a 
member. Mr I Elliott has accepted the role from that date.
Yours sincerely

Non-Executive Chairman, Remuneration Committee

Remuneration Committee Chairman’s Letter
Dear Shareholder
I am pleased to present the Directors’ Remuneration Report 
for 2017. This report has been prepared following a year in 
which the Group has seen a growth in turnover of 16.48% to 
£291.77 million (2016: £250.49 million). Although the Operating 
Profit achieved of £1.19 million (2016: £2.24 million) is below 
the Board’s and Committee’s expectations, the Underlying 
profitability of the continuing divisional segments has increased 
significantly to £8.30 million (2016: £5.91 million), which is 
testament to the continued efforts of the Executive Board 
members, together with Group’s other management and all 
employees.
Whilst we remain cautious in our overall outlook on executive 
pay, during 2017 we took actions (all of which were within 
the scope of our shareholders’ approved remuneration 
policy) which we felt were appropriate to reward our strongly 
performing executive team fairly. The changes can be 
summarised as follows:
Pay element Detail
Base salaries 
for 2018
John Homer – £310,000 (2017: £277,000)
Dan Taylor – £180,000 (2017: £160,000)
Andy Langman – £160,000 (2017: £150,000)
Stuart Proud – £160,000 (2017: £150,000)
Annual Bonus 
for 2018
Executive Directors’ maximum bonus 
opportunity increased to 60% of base salary 
(2017: 50% of base salary max)
We believe that it is correct to recognise the strong 
performance of our Executive Directors and other top 
performing staff. This has resulted in significantly improved 
underlying financial performance by the Group, which in turn 
has driven good returns for our shareholders and increased the 
size of the business. The share price increase from 1 January 
2017 to 31 December 2017 was 83% from £1.80 per share to 
£3.30 per share (noting the slight deterioration since the year 
end, with the current price at £2.98 per share).
We recognise that these salary increases are above normal 
“pay-inflation” levels, but we believe that when setting the 
levels of remuneration for the Executive Directors it is important 
to take particular care to ensure that the base salaries are 
commensurate to the increased size and complexity of their 
roles. The growth in turnover of 16.48% and the forecast 
turnover growth in turnover for 2018 of 13.0% is one of the 
areas taken in to consideration. We have also externally 
benchmarked these remuneration packages and are satisfied 
that these are in line with market rates.

Remuneration 
Introduction and Policy
Introduction
This report contains the material required to be set out as the Directors’ Remuneration Report for the purposes of Part 4 of The 
Large and Medium-sized Companies and Groups (Accounts and Reports) (Amendment) Regulations 2013, which amended The 
Large and Medium-sized Companies and Groups (Accounts and Reports) Regulations 2008 (“the DRR Regulations”).
Shareholder approval was obtained at the 2016 AGM for our Directors’ Remuneration Policy and we are not proposing to make 
any changes to this policy, which will continue to apply for the forthcoming year. For ease of reference, Part A below sets out 
the key features of our policy. The full policy is as disclosed in last year’s Annual Report. Part A is not subject to a vote at the 
2018 AGM.
Part B constitutes the implementation sections of the Remuneration Report (“Implementation Report”). The Auditor has reported 
on certain parts of the Implementation Report and stated whether, in their opinion, those parts have been properly prepared in 
accordance with the Companies Act 2006. Those parts of the Implementation Report which have been subject to audit are clearly 
indicated. Part B is subject to an advisory vote at the 2018 AGM.
Part A: Directors’ Remuneration Policy
The following table summarises the key features of our Directors’ Remuneration Policy. The policy has been developed mindful of 
the Corporate Governance Code and is felt to be appropriate to support the long-term success of the Company, whilst ensuring 
that it does not promote inappropriate risk-taking. For completeness, the scenario charts have been updated to reflect revisions to 
the Executive Directors’ packages for 2018. For the avoidance of doubt, we are bound by the Directors’ Remuneration Policy as 
published in the 2015 Annual Report.
Element and Purpose Policy and Operation Maximum Performance Measures
Executive Directors
Base salary 
This is the core element of pay 
and reflects the individual’s 
role and position within the 
Group with some adjustment 
to reflect their capability and 
contribution.
Base salaries will be reviewed 
each year by the Committee. 
The Committee does not 
strictly follow benchmark pay 
data but uses the median 
position as a reference point in 
considering, in its judgement, 
the appropriate level of 
salary having regard to other 
relevant factors, including 
corporate and individual 
performance and any changes 
in an individual’s role and 
responsibilities. 
Base salary is paid monthly 
through the payroll.
The Executive Directors’ 
salaries will not be increased 
so as to exceed the median 
for the equivalent roles in 
companies listed in the FTSE 
SmallCap Index. Normally, 
Executive Directors’ base 
salaries will not be increased 
by more than the average 
awarded to staff. However, 
during the life of this policy it 
may be necessary to make 
higher increases to bring the 
Executive Directors’ salaries 
closer to an appropriate 
market rate, and/or to reflect 
(i) an increase in scope of role/
responsibilities, (ii) any changes 
to other elements of an 
Executive Director’s package.

Benefits 
To provide benefits valued by 
recipients.
The Executive Directors 
receive private health care 
cover, a company car or car 
allowance and a company fuel 
card.
The Committee reserves 
discretion to introduce new 
benefits where it concludes 
that it is appropriate to do so, 
having regard to the particular 
circumstances and to market 
practice. 
Where appropriate, the 
Company will meet certain 
costs relating to Executive 
Director relocations.
It is not possible to prescribe 
the likely change in the cost 
of insured benefits or the cost 
of some of the other reported 
benefits year-to-year, but 
the provision of benefits will 
operate within an annual limit 
of £50,000 per Executive (plus 
a further 100% of base salary 
in the case of relocations). 
The Committee will monitor the 
costs of benefits in practice 
and will ensure that the overall 
costs do not increase by 
more than the Committee 
considers appropriate in all the 
circumstances.
N/A
Pension 
To provide retirement benefits.
Executive Directors can 
receive pension contributions 
to personal pension 
arrangements or, if a Director 
is impacted by annual or 
lifetime limits on contribution 
levels to qualifying pension 
plans, the balance can be paid 
as a cash supplement and/or 
consolidated into base salary.
The maximum employer’s 
contribution is limited to up to 
25% of base salary, although 
it is not currently anticipated 
that pension provision for the 
Executive Directors will be at 
this level.

Element and Purpose Policy and Operation Maximum Performance Measures
Annual Bonus Plan
To motivate Executives 
and incentivise delivery of 
performance over a one-year 
operating cycle, focusing on 
the short to medium-term 
elements of our strategic aims.
Annual Bonus Plan levels 
and the appropriateness 
of measures are 
reviewed annually at the 
commencement of each 
financial year to ensure they 
continue to support our 
strategy. 
Once set, performance 
measures and targets will 
generally remain unchanged 
for the year, except to reflect 
events such as corporate 
acquisitions or other major 
transactions where the 
Committee considers it to 
be necessary in its opinion 
to make appropriate 
adjustments. 
Annual Bonus Plan outcomes 
are paid in cash following the 
determination of achievement 
against performance 
measures and targets, albeit 
that a portion of the bonus 
can be deferred and payable a 
year later. 
Clawback/malus provisions 
apply to the Annual Bonus 
Plan as explained in more 
detail in the relevant note to 
the policy table (which does 
not form part of the policy 
itself).
The maximum annual bonus 
that can be earned is 75% of 
base salary for the duration 
of this policy. To the extent 
that the actual maximum 
bonus opportunity in any 
year was less than 75%, the 
Committee can in exceptional 
circumstances agree to pay 
a higher bonus than originally 
contemplated up to (but not 
exceeding) the overriding 75% 
salary cap. 
The performance measures 
applied may be financial or 
non-financial and corporate, 
divisional or individual and 
in such proportions as 
the Committee considers 
appropriate. 
The Committee’s current 
intention is that, for a 
threshold level of performance, 
a bonus of up to 30% of 
salary can be paid. The 
Annual Bonus Plan remains 
a discretionary arrangement 
and the Committee retains 
a standard power to apply 
its judgement to adjust the 
outcome of the Annual Bonus 
Plan for any performance 
measure (from zero to any 
cap) should it consider that to 
be appropriate. Further details 
of measures, their weighting 
and targets will be disclosed in 
the relevant Annual Report on 
Remuneration.

Element and Purpose Policy and Operation Maximum Performance Measures
Long-Term Incentives
Provided under the 
Performance Share Plan 
(“PSP”), to motivate and 
incentivise delivery of sustained 
performance and alignment 
with shareholders.
The primary ongoing long-
term incentive plan is the 
Performance Share Plan. 
Awards can be granted as 
conditional shares or a nil/
nominal cost option, vesting 
subject to the achievement 
of three-year performance 
conditions. Awards can be 
satisfied by shares and/or 
cash.
A payment equivalent to the 
dividends that would have 
accrued on the number of 
shares that vest may be made 
to participants on vesting, as 
cash or shares.
PSP awards are subject to 
clawback/malus provisions 
described more fully in the 
relevant note to the policy 
table (which does not form 
part of the policy itself).
Awards over shares worth 
up to 100% of salary can 
be granted each year (or 
such higher number as 
the Committee considers 
appropriate in exceptional 
circumstances, up to a 
maximum of 200%). Details 
of any awards granted in a 
year will be disclosed in the 
relevant Annual Report on 
Remuneration.
The Committee may set such 
performance conditions on 
PSP awards as it considers 
appropriate (whether financial 
or non-financial and whether 
corporate, divisional or 
individual).
Once set, performance 
measures and targets will 
generally remain unaltered 
unless events occur which, 
in the Committee’s opinion, 
make it appropriate to 
substitute, vary or waive 
the performance conditions 
in such manner as the 
Committee thinks fit.
Performance periods may 
be over such periods as the 
Committee selects at grant, 
which will not be less than 
(but may be longer than) three 
years.
No more than 25% of awards 
vest for attaining the threshold 
level of performance for each 
condition. Further details of 
measures, their weighting and 
targets will be disclosed in 
the relevant Annual Report on 
Remuneration.

All-employee Share Plans 
To encourage share ownership 
by employees, thereby allowing 
them to share in the long-term 
success of the Group and align 
their interests with those of the 
shareholders.
The Company operates an 
HMRC-approved Share 
Incentive Plan which follows 
the usual form for such plans. 
Executive Directors are able to 
participate in the plan on the 
same terms as other Group 
employees.
The maximum participation 
levels for the plan are set by 
HMRC from time to time.
Consistent with normal 
practice, such awards are 
not subject to performance 
conditions.
Non-Executive Directors
Non-Executive Director 
Fees 
To enable the Company 
to recruit and retain Non-
Executive Directors of 
the highest calibre, at the 
appropriate cost.
The fees paid to Non-
Executive Directors aim to be 
competitive with other fully 
listed companies of equivalent 
size and complexity. 
The fees payable to the 
Non-Executive Directors are 
determined by the Board. 
In the normal course, Non-
Executive Directors will not 
be granted awards under any 
incentive arrangements. 
The Company reserves the 
right to provide benefits 
(including travel and office 
support) within the prescribed 
limits.
Fees are paid monthly through 
payroll. 
The aggregate fees (and any 
benefits) of the Non-Executive 
Directors will not exceed 
£250,000 in aggregate. 
Any increases actually made 
will be appropriately disclosed.
N/A
Notes to the policy table:
Malus and clawback (for information and not part of the Directors’ Remuneration Policy)
Malus (being the forfeiture of any deferred element of incentive pay, including PSP awards) and clawback (being the ability of the 
Company to claim repayment (as a debt) of any net element of incentive pay previously paid) provisions can be applied by the 
Committee. If the Committee becomes aware that the financial (or other) results that they used to determine an incentive payout 
were incorrect which resulted in an overpayment and/or if the Committee becomes aware of an act or omission by an Executive 
Director that justifies (or would at the time have justified) summary dismissal, the Committee can apply malus and/or clawback on 
any incentive payment declared up to three years prior to the relevant event coming to light.
Stating maximum amounts for the remuneration policy
The DRR Regulations and related investor guidance encourages companies to disclose a cap within which each element of the 
Directors’ Remuneration Policy will operate. Where maximum amounts for elements of remuneration have been set within the 
above, these will operate simply as caps and are not indicative of any aspiration.
Travel and hospitality
While the Committee does not consider travel and hospitality to form part of benefits in the normal usage of that term, it has 
been advised that corporate hospitality (whether paid for by the Company or another party) and business travel for Directors (and 
exceptionally their families) may technically come within the applicable rules and so the Committee expressly reserves the right for 
the Committee to authorise such activities within its agreed policies.
Differences between the policy on remuneration for Directors from the policy on remuneration of other employees 
While the appropriate benchmarks vary by role, the Company seeks to apply the philosophy behind this policy across the 
Company as a whole. Where the Company’s pay policy for Directors differs from its pay policies for groups of employees, this 
reflects the appropriate market rate for the relevant roles. The Company takes into account pay levels and bonus opportunity 
applied across the Group as a whole when setting the Executive Directors’ Remuneration Policy.

Outstanding obligations
The Company will honour any commitments entered into prior 
to the approval and introduction of this policy.
Pension contributions
An Executive Director may elect to surrender salary or annual 
bonus outcomes in return for additional contributions to 
pension arrangements being made by the Company on his 
behalf. Any such amounts surrendered are regarded as part of 
the original pay element for the purposes of this policy rather 
than as amounts counting towards the maximum employer’s 
pension contribution stated in the table above. If the Company 
elects to increase the additional pension contribution to reflect 
any related employer’s NICs saving, any such increases 
to reflect employer’s NICs will be regarded as additional 
employer’s pension contributions for the purposes of this policy.
Committee discretions
The Committee will operate the Annual Bonus Plan and PSP 
according to their respective rules and the above policy table. 
The Committee retains discretion, consistent with market 
practice, in a number of respects, in relation to the operation 
and administration of these plans. 
These discretions include, but are not limited to, the following:
• The timing of grant of an award/bonus opportunity;
• The size of an award/bonus opportunity subject to the 
maximum limits set out in the policy table; 
• The determination of performance against targets and 
resultant vesting/bonus payouts;
• Discretion required when dealing with a change of control or 
restructuring of the Group;
• Determination of the treatment of leavers based on the rules 
of the plan and the appropriate treatment chosen;
• Adjustments required in certain circumstances (e.g. rights 
issues, corporate restructuring events and special dividends); 
and 
• The annual review of performance measures, weightings and 
targets from year to year. 
In addition, while performance measures and targets used in 
the Annual Bonus Plan and PSP will generally remain unaltered, 
if events occur which, in the Committee’s opinion, would make 
a different or amended target a fairer measure of performance, 
such amended or different target can be set provided that it is 
not materially more or less difficult to satisfy, having regard to 
the event in question. 
Any use of these discretions would, where relevant, be 
explained in the Directors’ Remuneration Report and 
may, where appropriate and practicable, be the subject of 
consultation with the Company’s major shareholders. The 
Committee may make minor amendments to the policy set out 
above for regulatory, exchange control, tax or administrative 
purposes or to take account of a change in legislation, without 
obtaining shareholder approval for that amendment.
Share ownership guidelines
Any vested shares under the proposed new Performance Share 
Plan must (unless the Remuneration Committee determines 
otherwise) be retained unless/until the Executive Director holds 
shares worth at least 100% of salary. 
Recruitment remuneration policy
The Company’s recruitment remuneration policy aims to give 
the Committee sufficient flexibility to secure the appointment 
and promotion of high-calibre Executives to strengthen the 
management team and secure the skill sets to deliver our 
strategic aims. The main features of this policy are described 
below.
In terms of the principles for setting a package for a new 
Executive Director, the starting point for the Committee will be 
to apply the general policy for Executive Directors as set out 
above and structure a package in accordance with that policy. 
Consistent with the DRR Regulations, the caps contained 
within the policy for fixed pay do not apply to new recruits, 
although the Committee would not envisage exceeding these 
caps in practice.
The Annual Bonus Plan and PSP will operate (including the 
maximum award levels) as detailed in the general policy in 
relation to any newly appointed Executive Director. For an 
internal appointment, any variable pay element awarded in 
respect of the prior role may either continue on its original terms 
or be adjusted to reflect the new appointment as appropriate.
For external and internal appointments, the Committee may 
agree that the Company will meet certain relocation expenses 
as it considers appropriate. For external candidates, it may be 
necessary to make additional awards in connection with the 
recruitment to buy-out awards forfeited by the individual on 
leaving a previous employer. 
For the avoidance of doubt, buy-out awards are not subject 
to a formal cap. Any recruitment-related awards which are not 
buy-outs will be subject to the limits for Annual Bonus Plan and 
PSP as stated in the general policy. Details of any recruitment-
related awards will be appropriately disclosed.
For any buy-outs the Company will not pay more than is, in the 
view of the Committee, necessary and will in all cases seek, in 
the first instance, to deliver any such awards under the terms 
of the existing Annual Bonus Plan and PSP . It may, however, 
be necessary in some cases to make buy-out awards on terms 
that are more bespoke than the existing Annual Bonus Plan or 
PSP (e.g. structure awards that may pay out over multi-year 
periods). 
All buy-outs, whether under the Annual Bonus Plan, PSP or 
otherwise, will take account of the service obligations and 
performance requirements for any remuneration relinquished 
by the individual when leaving a previous employer. The 
Committee will seek to make buy-outs subject to what are, in 
Remuneration  
Policy
72 North Midland Construction PLC Annual Report and Accounts for the year ended 31 December 2017 25748  5 April 2018 11:24 AM  Proof 14
its opinion, comparable requirements in respect of service and 
performance. However, the Committee may choose to relax this 
requirement in certain cases (such as where the service and/or 
performance requirements are materially completed, or where 
such factors are, in the view of the Committee, reflected in 
some other way, such as a significant discount to the face value 
of the awards forfeited) and where the Committee considers it 
to be in the interests of shareholders.
A new Non-Executive Director would be recruited on the same 
terms as explained above in respect of the main policy for such 
Directors.
Service Contracts 
None of the Executive Directors has a service contract which 
exceeds one year. The current notice periods are six months 
for all Executives. Copies of these contracts are kept at the 
Company’s registered office.
The Non-Executive Directors have letters of appointment. They 
are engaged for specific terms and their reappointment will not 
be automatic.
The date of each Executive Director’s contract is:
Name Date of latest contract
R Moyle March 2015
J Homer June 2016
DA Taylor February 2013
A Langman January 2018
DS Proud March 2015
Termination policy summary
The Committee will consider treatments on a termination having 
regard to all of the relevant facts and circumstances available 
at that time, the provisions of service contracts and the terms 
of any incentive arrangement. This policy applies both to any 
negotiations linked to notice periods on a termination and any 
treatments that the Committee may choose to apply under the 
discretions available to it under the terms of the Annual Bonus 
Plan, PSP or other incentive arrangement. 
Under the PSP , if during the performance or vesting period, a 
participant:
i. resigns or is dismissed, awards normally lapse in full;
ii. dies, awards vest in full 
iii. ceases to be employed due to injury, ill health, disability, 
redundancy, retirement, the participant’s employing 
company or employing part of a business being sold 
out of the Group or for any other reason the Committee 
determines, awards are retained and vest in the normal 
course subject to the performance conditions, or, if the 
Committee so decides, immediately on the participant 
ceasing to be in employment. Awards will be prorated 
by reference to the proportion of the performance period 
for which the participant remained employed, unless the 
Committee determines otherwise.
The Company has the power to enter into settlement 
agreements with Directors and to pay compensation to settle 
potential legal claims. In addition, and consistent with market 
practice, in the event of the termination of an Executive Director, 
the Company may make a contribution towards that individual’s 
legal fees and fees for outplacement services as part of a 
negotiated settlement. Any such fees will be disclosed as part 
of the detail of termination arrangements. For the avoidance of 
doubt, the policy does not include an explicit cap on the cost of 
termination payments.
External appointments
The Company’s policy is to permit an Executive Director to 
serve as a non-executive director elsewhere when this does not 
conflict with the individual’s duties to the Company. Where an 
Executive Director takes such a role, whether they are entitled 
to retain any fees which they earn from that appointment will 
be considered on a case by case basis. No Executive Directors 
currently hold any external appointments.
Statement of consideration of employment 
conditions elsewhere in the Group
Pay and employment conditions generally in the Group 
are taken into account when setting Executive Directors’ 
remuneration. The Committee receives regular updates on 
overall pay and conditions in the Group, including (but not 
limited to) changes in base pay and any staff bonus pools 
in operation. There is also oversight of the all-employee 
share schemes which Executive Directors and all other 
Group employees can participate in on the same terms and 
conditions.
Reflecting standard practice, the Company did not consult with 
employees in drawing up this Remuneration Report.
Statement of consideration of shareholder views
The Committee ensures that its major shareholders are 
consulted in advance of any material changes in Executive pay 
practices at the Company. The Committee also considers any 
feedback which it receives from its shareholders in relation to 
remuneration.

The charts above aim to show how the remuneration policy set out above for Executive Directors will apply in 2018 using the 
following assumptions: 
Minimum • Consists of base salary, benefits and pension.
• Base salary is the salary to be paid in 2018.
• Benefits are an estimate of benefits to be paid for the full year in 2018. 
• Pension measured as the defined contribution or cash allowance in lieu of Company contributions (excluding 
any pension paid in lieu of bonus).

Robert Moyle £369 £28 £50 £447

Daniel Taylor £180 £15 £27 £219
Andrew Langman £160 £15 £24 £197
Stuart Proud £160 £15 £24 £197
Target Based on what the Director would receive if performance was ‘on-target’. Therefore, includes fixed pay as above 
plus a target bonus payout of 40% of salary and an assumed target level of vesting under the PSP (i.e. 50%, 
excluding share price appreciation and dividends). Robert Moyle has agreed not to participate in the annual 
bonus from 1 January 2018 onwards.
Maximum Based on what the Director would receive if performance was at ‘maximum’. Therefore, includes fixed pay as 
above plus a maximum bonus payout of 60% of salary and full vesting of an illustrative 100% of salary award 
under the PSP (excluding share price appreciation and dividends). Robert Moyle does not participate in the PSP .

Bonus scheme (audited)
The bonus payable to the Executive Directors for 2017 was based on adjusted PBT targets. For the achievement of a threshold 
level of adjusted PBT, a bonus of 30% of salary was payable. For achieving a stretch level of adjusted PBT, a bonus of 50% of 
salary was payable (i.e. the normal maximum bonus payable). For Messrs Moyle, Homer and Taylor, their bonus was payable 
entirely by reference to Group PBT. As Messrs Langman and Proud are Managing Directors of specific business segments, 
a portion of their bonuses was payable on segment profits as well as Group PBT. In addition, the Committee reserved the 
right to reduce the provisional bonus payout (down to zero if thought appropriate) if the Committee believed that exceptional 
circumstances make it appropriate to do so. These exceptional circumstances could include (but are not limited to) (i) material 
reputational damage to the Company caused by mismanagement, (ii) material regulatory censure, (iii) a material breach of the 
Company’s Health, Safety and Environmental policies.

Given the competitive nature of the Company’s sector, the specific PBT targets for the Annual Bonus Plan are considered 
to be commercially sensitive and accordingly will not be disclosed until such time as the Committee believes them no longer 
commercially sensitive. In determining bonuses for 2017 the Committee excluded the significant adverse impact on PBT of the 
results of the litigation related to the one remaining legacy contract. With this exclusion all PBT targets for the annual bonus plan 
were materially exceeded. The Committee will exclude any reversal of the provision (increase of PBT) relating to the one remaining 
legacy contract in future years accordingly.

The PSP awards granted in 2017 were granted on the basis of shares worth 100% of each individual’s base salary, and calculated 
using the average market price of 295.83p taken using the last three trading days prior to grant on 27 April 2017. The exercise 
price is nil. The minimum share price in 2017 was 191p and the maximum share price was 432.5p. The closing share price on 
31 December 2017 was 330p. 
These awards vest based on performance against the aggregate Adjusted PBT targets shown below, each measured over a 
period of three financial years commencing with the year of grant.

exceptional items and/or reflect the impact of any major disposals/acquisitions etc. The required disclosures under IFRS 2 share 
based payments have been omitted under grounds of materiality and the Group’s performance.

As at 27 March 2018 the interest of DA Taylor was increased by 180 shares, J Homer 178 shares and 179 shares for each of 
AD Langman, DS Proud and R Moyle. This was as a result of their participation in the Employee Share Plan. The interests of the 
Directors in shares pursuant to their participation in the PSP are set out in the relevant section above. A share ownership guideline 
applies under which Executive Directors are required to retain (unless the Committee determines otherwise) all shares that vest 
under the PSP until such time as they hold shares worth 100% of salary. At present, Messrs Moyle and Langman satisfy this 
guideline, but Messrs Homer, Taylor and Proud do not.

remuneration for John Homer shows his remuneration since joining the Board. The 2016 single figure of total remuneration for Robert Moyle is prorated up until this 
date, when he ceased to act as Chief Executive Officer. Bonus caps were introduced from 1 January 2016.

The above CEO percentage base salary is that for Robert Moyle, the Executive Chairman. Mr Moyle acted as Chief Executive 
Officer until 31 May 2016. John Homer was appointed Chief Executive Officer with effect from 1 June 2016 and so does not have 
a full year’s service in 2016 to allow for the comparison between 2016 and 2017.

Remuneration Committee
The members of the Remuneration Committee (all of whom are independent Non-Executive Directors) are:
• Steve Brown (Chairman);
• Ian Elliot; and
• David Rogers.
The Committee’s principal responsibilities are:
• recommending to the Board the remuneration strategy and framework for the Executive Directors and senior managers;
• determining, within that framework, the individual remuneration arrangements for the Executive Directors and senior 
managers; and
• overseeing any major changes in employee benefit structures throughout the Group.
The Committee met on five occasions during the year, and three occasions after the year end.
Robert Moyle and John Homer are invited to attend meetings of the Committee, except when their own remuneration is being 
discussed, Daniel Taylor attends as secretary except when his own remuneration is being discussed and other Executives attend 
meetings as required.
The Committee has formal terms of reference which can be viewed on the Company’s website.
Advisers
FIT Remuneration Consultants LLP (FIT), signatories to the Remuneration Consultants Group’s Code of Conduct, continued to 
provide advice to the Committee on all matters relating to remuneration, including best practice. FIT provided no other services to the 
Group and, accordingly, the Committee is satisfied that the advice provided by FIT is objective and independent. FIT’s fees in respect 
of 2016 were £20,391.60 (ex VAT). FIT’s fees were charged on the basis of the firm’s standard terms of business for advice provided.
Implementation of Policy in 2018
Executive Directors
Base Salary
• Base salaries for the Executive Directors for 2018 will be as follows:  
Robert Moyle – £325,000 (plus £44,000 pension-related amount, with this additional amount not used to calculate pension 
entitlements) 
John Homer – £310,000 
Daniel Taylor – £180,000 
Messrs Langman and Proud – £160,000

GOVERNANCE 25748  5 April 2018 11:24 AM  Proof 14
Pension
• Contributions rates for Executive Directors for 2018 will be as follows:  
Robert Moyle – £50,000 (plus £44,000 uplift as salary, as noted above) 
Messrs Homer, Taylor, Langman and Proud – 15% of salary
Benefits
• Details of the benefits received by Executive Directors are set out on pages 75 and 76. 
• There is no current intention to introduce additional benefits in 2018.
Annual Bonus Plan
• While the overall Annual Bonus Plan maximum is 75% of base salary, in 2018 no bonus will be paid in excess of 60% of salary 
(save where exceptional performance makes it appropriate to pay a higher bonus to up, but not exceeding, the 75% plan 
maximum).
• The bonus payable to the Executive Directors for 2018 will be based on adjusted PBT targets. For the achievement of a target 
level of adjusted PBT, a bonus of 40% of salary will be payable. For achieving a stretch level of adjusted PBT, a bonus of 60% 
of salary will be payable which is the normal maximum bonus payable for 2018. For Messrs Homer and Taylor, their bonus 
is payable entirely by reference to Group adjusted PBT. As Messrs Langman and Proud are Managing Directors of specific 
business segments, a portion of their bonuses is payable on segment profits as well as Group adjusted PBT. As Executive 
Chairman, Mr R Moyle will not participate in the annual bonus scheme for 2018.
• In addition, the Committee may reduce the provisional bonus payout (down to zero if thought appropriate) if the Committee 
believes that exceptional circumstances make it appropriate to do so. These exceptional circumstances could include (but are 
not limited to) (i) material reputational damage to the Company caused by mismanagement, (ii) material regulatory censure, (iii) 
a material breach of the Company’s Health, Safety and Environmental policies.
• Given the competitive nature of the Company’s sector, the specific adjusted PBT targets for the Annual Bonus Plan are 
considered to be commercially sensitive and accordingly will not be disclosed until such time as the Committee believes them 
no longer commercially sensitive. 
• For the purposes of assessing performance against the adjusted PBT targets, the Committee may exclude the impact of any 
material one-off / non-recurring / ‘exceptional’ items which may be potentially PBT-enhancing and will determine, acting fairly 
and reasonably, how to treat any such items that may negatively impact PBT.
Performance Share Plan
It is intended that awards will be made to certain Executive Directors in 2018 over shares with 100% of salary.
These awards will vest three years after grant based upon performance against the following stretching three year aggregate 
adjusted PBT targets for 2018, 2019 and 2020:
Aggregate Adjusted PBT for 2018, 2019 and 2020 % of award that vests
£18.25m 0%
£21.25m 50%
£24.25m 100%
£18.25m – £24.25m 0% – 100% straight-line
• ‘Adjusted’ PBT will be used to determine vesting, thereby allowing the Remuneration Committee to remove the impact of one-
off/exceptional items and/or reflect the impact of any major disposals/acquisitions etc. 
Non-Executive Directors
The Non-Executive Directors’ fees for 2018 will be £40,000.
This report was reviewed and approved by the Board on 27 March 2018 and signed on its behalf by order of the Board.

Market Value of Shares at 31 March 1982
For Capital Gains Tax purposes, the market value of the 
Ordinary Shares of 10p in the Company as at 31 March 1982 
was 6.563 pence per share.
The Directors present their annual report and audited financial 
statements for the year ended 31 December 2017.
The Corporate Governance Statement approved by the Board 
is provided on pages 59 and 60 and incorporated by reference 
herein.
Results
The results of the Group for the year are as follows:
2017 
£’000
2016
£’000
Operating profit 1,191 2,241
Finance costs (187) (179)
Profit before tax 1,004 2,062
Tax (262) 572
Profit 742 2,634
Dividends
Details of dividends paid during the year of 3.0p (1.5p 
per ordinary share) are set out in note 11. The Directors 
recommend a final dividend of 3.0p (2016: 3.0p) for the year 
ended 31 December 2017. The Board is committed in the 
near future, subject to a sustained return to profitability, to the 
increased payment of dividends.
The Board’s strategy is to return to a steady attractive dividend 
and as such would expect to pay no less than 33% of all profits 
after tax back to its shareholders. If possible the Board should 
review payments up to 50% of profit after tax each year, subject 
to the Group’s growth profile, cash flow forecasts and other 
investment opportunities which would ultimately achieve higher 
returns for its shareholders.
Therefore, dividends each year to be reviewed by the Board 
between 33% and 50% of profit after tax giving dividend cover 
of between 2 and 3 times.
Any dividends paid outside of these parameters would be 
deemed exceptional by the Board. The current year’s dividends 
declared of 6.0p (2016: 4.5p) is exceptional based on the policy 
parameters, but has been proposed due to the underlying 
profitability, the cash generation and the secured workload for 
2018.
Directors
The Directors of the Company who served during the year are 
as shown on pages 56 and 57.
In accordance with the Articles of Association and the Group’s 
commitment to following applicable governance requirements, 
SJT Brown, I Elliot and D Rogers retire by rotation and, being 
eligible, offer themselves for re-election.

Directors’  
Report
Auditor and Disclosure of Information to Auditor
Each Director has taken steps that they ought to have taken as 
a Director in order to make themselves aware of any relevant 
audit information and to establish that the Company’s Auditor 
is aware of that information. The Directors confirm that there 
is no relevant information that they know of which the Auditor 
is unaware of. This confirmation is given and should be 
interpreted in accordance with the provisions of section 418 of 
the Companies Act 2006.
Share Capital
Details of the authorised and issued share capital of the 
Company are set out in note 18.
The Directors believe that it would be advantageous to the 
Company to have more flexibility as regards the shares in the 
Company. The Directors have, therefore, decided to request 
shareholders to confer the authorities as detailed below. The 
Directors will be voting in favour of the proposed Resolutions in 
respect of their own shareholdings in the Company, and they 
recommend that you vote in favour of the Resolutions.
Greenhouse Gas Emission
Details of our emission during the year are set out on pages 51 
and 52 and form part of the Directors’ Report Disclosures.
Authority to Allot Equity Securities (Resolution 6)
Generally, the Directors may only allot shares in the Company 
(or grant rights to subscribe for, or to convert any security into, 
shares in the Company) if they have been authorised to do so 
by shareholders.
If passed, Resolution 6 will authorise the Directors to allot 
shares in the Company (and to grant rights to subscribe for, 
or to convert any security into, shares in the Company) up to 
an aggregate nominal amount of £50,750 (which represents 
approximately 5% of the Company’s issued share capital as 
at 1 April 2018, being the last practicable date before the 
publication of this document).
If given, this authority will expire at the conclusion of the 
Company’s next Annual General Meeting or 15 months from 
the passing of the Resolution (whichever is earlier). It is the 
Directors’ intention to renew the allotment authority each year. 
There are no present plans to exercise this authority.
Disapplication of Pre-emption Rights (Resolution 7)
Resolution 7, if passed, would enable the Directors to allot 
shares for cash on a non pre-emptive basis up to an aggregate 
nominal amount of £50,750 (which represents approximately 
5% of the Company’s issued share capital as at 1 April 2018), 
without having to first offer them to shareholders in proportion 
to their existing holdings. This limit is in line with the guidelines 
issued by the Pre-emption Group.
If given, this authority will expire at the conclusion of the 
Company’s next Annual General Meeting or 15 months from 
the passing of the Resolution (whichever is earlier). It is the 
Directors’ intention to renew this authority each year. There are 
no present plans to exercise this authority.
Authority to Purchase Ordinary Shares (Resolution 8)
Resolution 8 will be proposed as a Special Resolution to give 
the Company authority to purchase its own shares in the 
market during the period until the next Annual General Meeting 
of the Company for up to 1,000,000 shares, representing 
approximately 10% of the issued ordinary share capital of the 
Company. 
The Directors have no current intention of exercising this 
authority to purchase the Company’s ordinary shares. The 
Company will only exercise this authority to make such a 
purchase in the market if the Directors consider it is in the best 
interests of the shareholders generally to do so.
The Company is permitted to hold shares it has purchased in 
treasury, as an alternative to cancelling them. Shares held in 
treasury may subsequently be cancelled, sold for cash or used 
to satisfy options exercised under any of the Company’s share 
schemes. Whilst held in treasury, the shares are not entitled 
to receive any dividend or dividend equivalent (apart from any 
issue of bonus shares) and have no voting rights. The Directors 
believe it is appropriate for the Company to have the option to 
hold its own shares in treasury if, at a future date, the Directors 
exercise this authority. The Directors will have regard to investor 
Group guidelines which may be in force at the time of any such 
purchase, holding or resale of shares held in treasury.
If given, this authority will expire at the conclusion of the 
Company’s next Annual General Meeting or 15 months after 
the passing of the Resolution (whichever is earlier). It is the 
Directors’ intention to renew this authority each year.
Amendments to the Articles of Association of the 
Company (Resolution 9)
Resolution 9, if passed, will introduce certain amendments to 
the Company’s articles of association, in compliance with the 
requirements and authorisations provided for in the Companies 
Act 2006. A full explanation of the proposed amendments is 
given in the Appendix to the Notice of Meeting on pages 117 to 
119.

Directors’ Responsibilities Statement
The Directors are responsible for preparing the annual report 
and the financial statements in accordance with applicable law 
and regulations. 
Company law requires the Directors to prepare financial 
statements for each financial year. Under that law the Directors 
are required to prepare the Group financial statements and 
have elected to prepare the Company financial statements in 
accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards 
(IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union. Under Company 
law the Directors must not approve the financial statements 
unless they are satisfied that they give a true and fair view of the 
state of affairs of the Group and Company and of the profit or 
loss for the Group for that period. 
In preparing these financial statements, the Directors are 
required to:
• select suitable accounting policies and then apply them 
consistently;
• make judgements and accounting estimates that are 
reasonable and prudent;
• state whether they have been prepared in accordance with 
IFRSs as adopted by the European Union, subject to any 
material departures disclosed and explained in the financial 
statements; 
• prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis 
unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Company will 
continue in business; 
• prepare a Directors’ Report, a Strategic Report and Directors’ 
Remuneration Report which comply with the requirements of 
the Companies Act 2006.
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting 
records that are sufficient to show and explain the Company’s 
transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any 
time the financial position of the Company and enable them 
to ensure that the financial statements comply with the 
Companies Act 2006 and, as regards the Group financial 
statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation. They are also 
responsible for safeguarding the assets of the Company and 
hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and 
detection of fraud and other irregularities. The Directors are 
responsible for ensuring that the annual report and accounts, 
taken as a whole, are fair, balanced, and understandable and 
provide the information necessary for shareholders to assess 
the Group’s performance, business model and strategy.
Website publication
The Directors are responsible for ensuring the annual report 
and the financial statements are made available on a website. 
Financial statements are published on the Company’s website 
in accordance with legislation in the United Kingdom governing 
the preparation and dissemination of financial statements, 
which may vary from legislation in other jurisdictions. The 
maintenance and integrity of the Company’s website is the 
responsibility of the Directors. The Directors’ responsibility also 
extends to the ongoing integrity of the financial statements 
contained therein.
Directors’ responsibilities pursuant to DTR4
The Directors confirm to the best of their knowledge:
• The Group financial statements have been prepared in 
accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards 
(IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union and Article 4 of 
the IAS Regulation and give a true and fair view of the assets, 
liabilities, financial position and profit and loss of the Group.
• The annual report includes a fair review of the development 
and performance of the business and the financial position 
of the Group and the parent Company, together with a 
description of the principal risks and uncertainties that they 
face.

Auditor’s Report
Opinion on financial statements
We have audited the financial statements of North Midland Construction PLC (the “Parent Company’) and its subsidiaries (the 
“Group”’) for the year ended 31 December 2017 which comprise the Group Statement of Comprehensive Income, the Statements 
of Changes in Equity of the Group and Company, the Balance Sheets of the Group and Company, the Statements of Cash Flows 
of the Group and Company and notes to the financial statements, including a summary of significant accounting policies. The 
financial reporting framework that has been applied in their preparation is applicable law and International Financial Reporting 
Standards (“IFRSs”) as adopted by the European Union and, as regards the Parent Company financial statements, as applied in 
accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006.
In our opinion:
• the financial statements give a true and fair view of the state of the Group’s and the Parent Company’s affairs as at 31 December 
2017 and of the Group’s profit for the year then ended;
• the Group financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union;
• the Parent Company financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European 
Union and as applied in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006; and
• the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 and, as regards 
the Group financial statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation.
Basis for opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK) (ISAs (UK)) and applicable law. Our 
responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements 
section of our report. We are independent of the Group and the Parent Company in accordance with the ethical requirements 
that are relevant to our audit of the financial statements in the UK, including the FRC’s Ethical Standard as applied to listed public 
interest entities, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements. We believe that the 
audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.
Use of our report
This report is made solely to the Parent Company’s members, as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the 
Companies Act 2006. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the Parent Company’s members those 
matters we are required to state to them in an auditor’s report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we 
do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the Parent Company and the Parent Company’s members as a body, 
for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.
Conclusions relating to principal risks, going concern and viability statement
We have nothing to report in respect of the following information in the annual report, in relation to which the ISAs (UK) require us 
to report to you whether we have anything material to add or draw attention to:
• the disclosures in the annual report set out on page 38 that describe the principal risks and explain how they are being managed 
or mitigated;
• the Directors’ confirmation set out on page 83 in the annual report that they have carried out a robust assessment of the 
principal risks facing the group, including those that would threaten its business model, future performance, solvency or liquidity;
• the Directors’ statement set out on page 83 in the financial statements about whether the Directors considered it appropriate to 
adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing the financial statements and the Directors’ identification of any material 
uncertainties to the Group and the Parent Company’s ability to continue to do so over a period of at least twelve months from 
the date of approval of the financial statements;
• whether the Directors’ statement relating to going concern required under the Listing Rules in accordance with Listing Rule 
9.8.6R(3) is materially inconsistent with our knowledge obtained in the audit; or
• the Directors’ explanation set out on page 39 in the annual report as to how they have assessed the prospects of the Group, 
over what period they have done so and why they consider that period to be appropriate, and their statement as to whether they 
have a reasonable expectation that the Group will be able to continue in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due over the 
period of their assessment, including any related disclosures drawing attention to any necessary qualifications or assumptions.
Key audit matters
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the financial 
statements of the current period and include the most significant assessed risks of material misstatement (whether or not due to 
fraud) we identified, including those which had the greatest effect on: the overall audit strategy, the allocation of resources in the 
audit; and directing the efforts of the engagement team. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial 
statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.

Key audit matter How our audit addressed the key audit matter
Recognition of revenue and attributable profit 
(or losses) on contracts:
Refer to page 62 (Audit Committee Report) 
and notes 2 and 4 to the financial statements 
for the Directors’ disclosures of the related 
accounting policies, judgments and estimates.
Revenue and attributable profit (or loss) is 
recognised on the stage of completion of 
individual contracts and frameworks, calculated 
on the proportion of total costs incurred at the 
reporting date as compared to the projected 
total costs at completion. Expected losses are 
recognised immediately as an expense.
The extent of revenue and profit / loss to 
recognise on a particular partially completed 
contract represents an area of significant 
judgement within the financial statements, 
which involves an assessment of both current 
and future contract performance.
The potential outcomes for contracts can have 
an individual or collectively material impact on 
the financial statements, whether through error 
or management bias.
Legacy contracts, which carry a high 
contractual and commercial risk, may be 
subject to estimation uncertainty.
For a selection of contracts from each operating segment we obtained a copy 
of the contract documentation and critically assessed and challenged the 
recognition of revenue from review of the performance of the contract. 
• We substantively tested the revenue figures as applied to the contracts 
throughout the year.
• We tested the controls  governing  applications for payment and recognition 
of WIP , the application of payroll, subcontractor and purchasing costs to the 
contracts ledger for operational effectiveness throughout the year.
• We assessed the position adopted by management at the year end as 
compared to external evidence being customers’ certification of work done or 
other relevant correspondence.
• We carried out a detailed review of the post year end performance of the 
contracts to corroborate estimates taken at the year end in respect of costs 
expected to be incurred and challenged assumptions which appeared 
inconsistent with actual post year end performance.
• Groups of contracts negotiated as a single framework were reviewed to 
ensure they were accounted for on a weighted average basis and accurately 
reflected the overall performance of the contract.
• We assessed the reliability of management estimates in light of the positions 
adopted in previous years compared to actual out-turn.
• We reviewed legal and experts’ reports instructed and received on 
contentious issues and contracts.
• We considered the specific accounting entries and disclosure of legacy 
contracts.
Recoverability of trade receivables and 
amounts recoverable under construction 
contracts:
Refer to page 62 (Audit Committee Report) 
and notes 2 and 4 to the financial statements 
for the Directors’ disclosures of the related 
accounting policies, judgments and estimates.
This area was assessed as a significant risk 
because construction contract assets (trade 
receivables and amounts recoverable under 
construction contracts) may be subject to 
complex negotiated settlements or dispute.
We identified individual trade receivable and amounts recoverable under 
construction contract balances which we considered presented the greatest 
risk of exposure either by size or by age. 
Where possible we corroborated the year end trade receivables to post year 
end payments and customer remittances. Where construction contract assets 
had not been supported by external certifications we agreed the balance to QS 
applications at the year end and where applicable, external expert quantification 
opinions.
If payment had not been received we inspected correspondence with the 
customer, including customer certifications of applications made for payment 
and customer payment history to assess the recoverability of the debt.
We challenged management’s assessment of the recoverability of trade 
receivables and construction contract balances in light of the evidence available 
to us, including a review of legal and experts’ reports instructed and received on 
contentious issues.
We inspected a sample of retention balances and in each case we corroborated 
the value of the retention to customer correspondence and confirmed when the 
retention was due. For all retentions that were due we reviewed the status of the 
project and formed a conclusion on the recoverability of the balance in light of 
the evidence presented.

Independent  
Auditor’s Report
Our application of materiality
We apply the concept of materiality both in planning and performing our audit, and in evaluating the effect of misstatements. For 
planning, we consider materiality to be the magnitude by which misstatements, including omissions, could influence the economic 
decisions of reasonable users, that are taken on the basis of the financial statements. In order to reduce to an appropriately 
low level the probability that any misstatements exceed materiality we use a lower materiality level, performance materiality, 
to determine the extent of testing needed. Importantly, misstatements below these levels will not necessarily be evaluated as 
immaterial as we also take account of the nature of identified misstatements, and the particular circumstances of their occurrence, 
when evaluating their effect on the financial statements as a whole.
We determined materiality for the financial statements as a whole to be £414,000 (2016: £1,850,000) for the Group and £364,000 
(2016: £1,500,000) for the Company. In determining this, we based our assessment on 5% of underlying profit (2016: 0.75% 
of turnover). We believe that underlying profit (as defined on page 1 of the annual report) represents one of the principal key 
performance indicators for the Group and Parent Company, and is a generally accepted auditing benchmark.
Performance materiality was set at 75% of the above materiality levels based on a strong control environment and a low level of 
expected misstatements.
Whilst materiality for the financial statements of the Group as a whole was £414,000, each component of the Group was 
audited to a lower level of materiality. Audits of the components were performed at a materiality level calculated by reference to a 
proportion of Group materiality appropriate to the relative scale of the business concerned.
We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report for their consideration all individual audit differences in excess of £8,280 
and £7,280 for the Group and Company respectively. We also agreed to report differences below this threshold that, in our view, 
warranted reporting on qualitative grounds.
Scope of the audit of the financial statements
 The Group audit strategy was risk based and the nature and extent of our testing was established by concluding on the areas we 
considered represented a significant risk of material misstatement. In making this assessment we:
• Assessed the degree of estimation uncertainty associated with the judgements taken by the Directors during the preparation 
of the financial statements taking into account external factors which could result in management bias. This was specifically 
focused in the extent of profit or loss recognised on certain contracts. We inspected the performance of the six operating 
divisions inclusive of joint operations and selected certain contracts from each operating segment which we considered 
presented the greatest risk of material misstatement for detailed testing.
• Critically assessed the Group control environment and internal systems used to generate the following key accounting entries, 
revenue, direct material costs, subcontractor costs, payroll, stock and work in progress.
• Comparatively reviewed the performance of the Group against our expectations based on our knowledge of the Group, other 
relevant sector knowledge, the external economic conditions and historic performance and trends.
• Considered non-routine or unusual transactions which have an inherent risk of material error.
Our Group audit scope focused on the trading Parent Company, North Midland Construction PLC and trading subsidiary 
Nomenca Limited which were both subject to a full scope audit by the Group audit team. These entities represent the principal 
business units of the Group and account for 100% of the Group’s revenue, 100% of the Group’s profit before tax and 100% of the 
Group’s total assets.

Other information
The Directors are responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the information included in the annual 
report, other than the financial statements and our auditor’s report thereon. Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover 
the other information and, except to the extent otherwise explicitly stated in our report, we do not express any form of assurance 
conclusion thereon.
In connection with our audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider 
whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit or 
otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If we identify such material inconsistencies or apparent material misstatements, 
we are required to determine whether there is a material misstatement in the financial statements or a material misstatement of 
the other information. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of the other 
information, we are required to report that fact.
We have nothing to report in this regard.
In this context, we also have nothing to report in regard to our responsibility to specifically address the following items in the other 
information and to report as uncorrected material misstatements of the other information where we conclude that those items 
meet the following conditions:
• Fair, balanced and understandable set out on page 83 – the statement given by the directors that they consider the annual 
report and financial statements taken as a whole is fair, balanced and understandable and provides the information necessary 
for shareholders to assess the Group’s performance, business model and strategy, is materially inconsistent with our knowledge 
obtained in the audit; or
• Audit committee reporting set out on page 61 – the section describing the work of the audit committee does not 
appropriately address matters communicated by us to the audit committee; or
• Directors’ statement of compliance with the UK Corporate Governance Code set out on page 60 – the parts of the 
Directors’ statement required under the Listing Rules relating to the Company’s compliance with the UK Corporate Governance 
Code containing provisions specified for review by the auditor in accordance with Listing Rule 9.8.10R(2) do not properly 
disclose a departure from a relevant provision of the UK Corporate Governance Code.
Opinions on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006
In our opinion the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited has been properly prepared in accordance with the 
Companies Act 2006.
In our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of the audit:
• the information given in the Strategic Report and Directors’ Report for the financial year for which the financial statements are 
prepared is consistent with the financial statements; and
• the Strategic Report and Directors’ Report have been prepared in accordance with applicable legal requirements.

Auditor’s Report
Matters on which we are required to report by exception
In the light of the knowledge and understanding of the Group and Parent Company and its environment obtained in the course of 
the audit, we have not identified material misstatements in the Strategic Report or the Directors’ Report.
We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters in relation to which the Companies Act 2006 requires us to report to 
you if, in our opinion:
• adequate accounting records have not been kept by the Parent Company, or returns adequate for our audit have not been 
received from branches not visited by us; or
• the Parent Company financial statements and the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited are not in agreement 
with the accounting records and returns; or
• certain disclosures of Directors’ remuneration specified by law are not made; or
• we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit.
Responsibilities of Directors
As explained more fully in the Directors’ responsibilities statement, the Directors are responsible for the preparation of the financial 
statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view, and for such internal control as the Directors determine is 
necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
In preparing the financial statements, the Directors are responsible for assessing the Group’s and the Parent Company’s ability to 
continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of 
accounting unless the Directors either intend to liquidate the Group or the Parent Company or to cease operations, or have no 
realistic alternative but to do so.
Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material 
misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a 
high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs (UK) will always detect a material 
misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the 
aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial 
statements.
A further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements is located on the Financial Reporting Council’s 
website at: www.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities. This description forms part of our auditor’s report.
Other matters which we are required to address
Following the recommendation of the Audit Committee, we were appointed by the members on 14 December 2010 to audit the 
financial statements for the year ending 31 December 2010 and subsequent financial periods. The period of total uninterrupted 
engagement is 8 years, covering the years ending 31 December 2010 to 31 December 2017.
The non-audit services prohibited by the FRC’s Ethical Standard were not provided to the Group or the Parent Company and we 
remain independent of the Group and the Parent Company in conducting our audit.
Our audit opinion is consistent with the additional report to the audit committee.

Notes to the Financial Statements
1. Notes to the financial statements
The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) and 
interpretations as adopted by the European Union and in accordance with those parts of the Companies Act 2006 that are 
relevant to entities reporting under IFRS. The financial statements are presented in sterling and have been prepared on a historical 
cost basis.
Accounting standards issued but not adopted
None of the amendments to standards that are effective from 1 January 2017 had a significant effect on the Group’s financial 
statements.
The Group has not early adopted the following new standards, amendments or interpretations that have been issued but are not 
yet effective:
• IFRS 9 Financial Instruments (effective 1 January 2018)
• IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers (effective 1 January 2018)
• IFRS 16 Leases (effective 1 January 2019)
• Annual Improvements to IFRSs (2014–2016 Cycle) (effective 1 January 2018 and 1 January 2019)
• IFRS 2 Classification and Measurement of Share-based Payment Transactions (effective 1 January 2018)
The Group has commenced its assessment of the impact of these standards and IFRS 9, IFRS 15 and IFRS 16 are considered in 
further detail below. The Group is not yet in a position to state whether the remaining standards would have a material impact on 
its results of operations and financial position. The Group does not intend on early adopting any of these standards.
IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers (effective for the year beginning 1 January 2018), provides a single, principles-
based five-step model to be applied to all sales contracts, based on the transfer of control of goods and services to customers. It 
replaces the separate models for goods, services and construction contracts currently included in IAS 11 Construction Contracts 
and IAS 18 Revenue. The most significant areas of change which could potentially have an effect are:
• The standard prescribes that revenue is either all recognised at a point in time, or is recognised over time, depending on an 
assessment of when the performance obligation is deemed to be satisfied
• Recognition of variable income is subject to a revenue constraint such that revenue may only be recognised to the extent that it 
is highly probable that a significant reversal in the amount of revenue recognised will not occur in future
• There is also a requirement to both bundle and unbundle contracts depending on how the standard guidance on performance 
obligations applies to the individual contractual arrangements of the Group

2. Significant accounting policies 
The principal accounting policies adopted in the preparation of the Group’ s financial statements in dealing with items which are 
considered material are set out below. These policies have been consistently applied to all the years presented unless otherwise stated. 
(a) Consolidation
The consolidated accounts include the audited financial statements of the Company and its subsidiaries for the year ended  
31 December 2017. All inter-company transactions and balances are eliminated on consolidation. Where the Company has control over 
an investment it is classified as a subsidiary. The Company controls an investee where all three of the following elements are present: 
power over the investee, exposure to variable returns from the entity, and the ability of the investor to affect those variable returns. Control 
is reassessed whenever facts and circumstances indicate that there may be a change in any of these elements of control. 
1. Notes to the financial statements continued
The Group’s IFRS 15 transition project is substantially complete and it is intended that the standard will be implemented with full 
retrospective application in the Group’s 2018 financial statements. The choice of transitional practical expedients is being finalised 
and will be determined during the early part of 2018. The Directors estimate that the impact of applying IFRS 15 on the 2018 
financial statements will be as below:
Revenue £m
Revenue for the year ended 31 December 2017 prior to restatement 291.8
Estimated IFRS 15 adjustment 8.1
Revenue for the year ended 31 December 2017 after restatement 299.9
Profit and total comprehensive income
Profit and total comprehensive income for the year ended 31 December 2017 prior to restatement 0.7
Estimated IFRS 15 adjustment 6.5
Profit and total comprehensive income for the year ended 31 December 2017 after restatement 7.2
Retained earnings
Retained earnings at 1 January 2017 prior to restatement 11.2
Estimated IFRS 15 adjustment (6.5)
Retained earnings at 1 January 2017 after restatement 4.7
Profit and total comprehensive income for the year ended 31 December 2017 after restatement 7.2
Dividends payable (0.6)
Retained earnings at 31 December 2017 after restatement 11.3
Based on the analysis above the Directors consider that, following restatement under IFRS 15, the net assets of the Group at 31 
December 2017 will not vary materially from those shown in these financial statements. This assessment is subject to the precise 
choice of transitional arrangements adopted and the amounts presented in the 31 December 2018 financial statements may differ 
to the amounts presented above.
IFRS 9 Financial Instruments (effective for the year beginning 1 January 2018) replaces IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition 
and Measurement and specifies how an entity should classify and measure financial assets, financial liabilities, and some contracts 
to buy or sell non-financial items. The most significant area of change which could potentially have an effect is the “expected loss” 
model, under which an allowance for credit losses is calculated by considering the cash shortfalls that would be incurred in various 
default scenarios and multiplying the shortfalls by the probability of each scenario occurring.
Based on an assessment of historic credit losses on loans and receivables, the Directors consider that the impact of adopting 
IFRS 9 will not have a material impact on the 2018 financial statements.
IFRS 16 Leases (effective for the year beginning 1 January 2019) replaces IAS 17 Leases and provides a single lease accounting 
model, requiring lessees to recognise right of use assets and lease liabilities in the Balance Sheet for all applicable leases. 
Operating lease costs currently recognised within operating profit in the Statement of Comprehensive Income will be replaced by 
depreciation and finance costs. IFRS 16 is expected to have a significant effect on the amounts recognised in the Group’s financial 
statements as at 31 December 2019, representing an increase in gross assets and liabilities in the Balance Sheet and an increase 
in operating profit and finance costs in the Statement of Comprehensive Income. The full impact of the standard is currently under 
review, therefore it is not practical to provide a reasonable estimate of the financial effect until this review is complete.

2. Significant accounting policies continued
(b) Property, plant and equipment 
Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Land is not depreciated.
Depreciation is calculated to write off the cost of assets less any residual value by equal instalments over their estimated lives 
which are considered to be:
Buildings      – a maximum of 50 years
Plant and machinery    – between 3 and 15 years
Fixtures, fittings, equipment and motor vehicles – between 2 and 10 years
Assets held under finance leases are depreciated over their expected useful lives on the same basis as owned assets. All 
estimated useful economic lives and residual values are reviewed on an annual basis and adjusted if appropriate. Gains and losses 
on disposal are recognised through the Statement of Comprehensive Income. 
(c) Inventories 
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost includes direct materials and, where applicable, direct 
labour together with a proportion of direct overheads. 
(d) Construction contracts 
Where the outcome of a construction contract can be estimated reliably, revenue and costs are recognised by reference to the 
stage of completion of activity at the balance sheet date. This is normally measured by the proportion that contract costs incurred 
for work performed to date bear to the estimated total contract costs. Variations in contract work, claims and incentive payments 
are included to the extent that it is probable that they will result in revenue and that they are capable of being reliably measured. 
Where the income of a construction contract cannot be estimated reliably, contract revenue is recognised to the extent of contract 
costs incurred that it is probable will be recoverable. Contract costs are recognised as expenses in the period in which they are 
incurred. 
Where a group of contracts negotiated as a single framework are performed on a concurrent or continuous basis, and are 
so closely interrelated that in effect they are part of a single project with a single profit margin, then they accounted for as an 
aggregated single construction contract. Such contracts are accounted for on a weighted basis reflecting any known inequalities 
in profitability and giving a more accurate reflection of the overall performance of the contract.
Where it is anticipated that total contract costs will exceed total contract revenue, the expected loss is recognised as an expense 
immediately. The recoverable sales value of work carried out at the balance sheet date, which has not been applied for, is 
recognised as construction contracts in the Balance Sheet.
Trade receivables includes unpaid applications both certified and uncertified. Applications and certificates are reduced accordingly 
based on the stage of completion of a contract when compared to the cash received at the balance sheet date.
The cost incurred in relation to work completed at the balance sheet date, net of progress buying on construction contracts, is 
recognised in trade payables. In addition, any payments received in advance of completing the work are also recognised in trade 
payables. 
Legacy contracts, being those entered into before 31 December 2013 and carrying a high contractual and commercial risk, are 
also accounted for on this basis. This is discussed further in note 4.1.
(e) Taxation 
Income tax for the period is based on the taxable income for the year and is measured as the amount expected to be paid or 
received from the tax authorities. Taxable income differs from profit as reported in the Statement of Comprehensive Income for 
the period as there are some items which may never be taxable or deductible for tax and other items which may be deductible or 
taxable in other periods. Income tax for the period is calculated using the current ruling tax rate. 
Deferred tax is the future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts and tax bases of assets and 
liabilities shown in the Balance Sheet. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are not recognised if they arise in the following situations: 
the initial recognition of goodwill; or the initial recognition of assets and liabilities that affect neither accounting nor taxable profit. 
The amount of deferred tax provided is based on the expected manner of recovery or settlement of the carrying amount of assets 
and liabilities, using tax rates enacted or substantially enacted at the balance sheet date. 
97 North Midland Construction PLC Annual Report and Accounts for the year ended 31 December 2017
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 25748  3 April 2018 4:52 PM  Proof 14
The Group does not recognise deferred tax liabilities, or deferred tax assets, on temporary differences associated with investments 
in subsidiaries, where the Parent Company is able to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences and it is 
not considered probable that the temporary differences will reverse in the foreseeable future. It is the Group’s policy to reinvest 
undistributed profits arising in Group companies.
A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the 
asset can be utilised. The carrying amount of the deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the 
extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profit will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered. 
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are not discounted. 
(f) Pensions 
The Group operates defined contribution personal pension schemes. The assets of the schemes are held separately from those 
of the Group in independently administered funds. The pension cost charge represents contributions payable by the Group to the 
funds. 
(g) Leases
Assets held under finance leases are recognised as assets of the Group at the fair value at the inception of the leases or, if lower, 
at the present value of the minimum lease payments. The related liability to the lessor is included in the Balance Sheet as a finance 
lease obligation. 
Lease payments are apportioned between interest expenses and capital redemption of the liability. Interest is recognised 
immediately in profit or loss, unless attributable to qualifying assets, in which case they are capitalised to the cost of those assets. 
Operating lease payments are recognised as an expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term except if another systematic 
basis is more representative of the time pattern in which economic benefit will flow to the Group.
Contingent rentals are recognised as expenses in the periods in which they are incurred.
(h) Reinstatement provision
The reinstatement provision represents the Directors’ best estimate of the fair value of expected costs relating to the statutory 
maintenance liability of two years on all contracts undertaken in the public highway. 
(i) Joint operations 
The Group is a party to a joint arrangement when there is a contractual arrangement that confers joint control over the relevant 
activities of the arrangement to the Group and at least one other party. Joint control is assessed under the same principles as 
control over subsidiaries.
Where the Group has both the rights to assets and obligations for the liabilities of the joint arrangement it classifies its interests as 
a joint operation.
In assessing the classification of interests in joint arrangements, the Group considers:
• The structure of the joint arrangement
• The legal form of joint arrangements structured through a separate vehicle
• The contractual terms of the joint arrangement agreement
• Any other facts and circumstances (including any other contractual arrangements)
The Group accounts for its interests in joint operations by recognising its share of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses in 
accordance with its contractually conferred rights and obligations.

(j) Financial instruments
The Group classifies financial instruments, or their component parts, on initial recognition as a financial asset, a financial liability or 
an equity instrument in accordance with the substance of the contractual arrangement. 
The Group has the following principal financial instruments:
Trade receivables
Trade receivables are stated at their original invoiced value, as the interest that would be recognised from discounting future cash 
receipts over the short credit period is not considered to be material. Trade receivables are reduced by appropriate allowances for 
estimated irrecoverable amounts. Interest on overdue trade receivables is recognised as it accrues. 
Retentions are included in trade receivables and are stated at their original invoiced value, as the interest that would be recognised 
from discounting future cash receipts over the short credit period is not considered to be material.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash equivalents comprise short-term highly liquid investments that are readily convertible into known amounts of cash and which 
are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value. An investment with a maturity of three months or less is normally classified 
as being short term. Cash and cash equivalents do not include other financial assets. 
Interest-bearing borrowings (obligations under finance leases and bank overdraft)
Interest-bearing borrowings are stated at amortised cost using the effective interest method. The effective interest method is a 
method of calculating the amortised cost of a financial liability and of allocating interest expense over the relevant period. The 
effective interest rate is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash payments through the expected life of the financial 
liability.
Trade payables
Trade payables are stated at their original invoiced value, as the interest that would be recognised from discounting future cash 
payments over the short payment period is not considered to be material. 
(k) Segment reporting 
Operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to the chief operating decision maker, 
who is also the Chief Executive. 
(l) Impairment of financial assets
All financial assets excluding cash and those measured at fair value through profit and loss, are assessed for indicators of 
impairment at each reporting date.
(m) Investments in subsidiaries 
Investments in subsidiaries are carried at cost less any provision for impairment.
(n) Business combinations under common control
Business combinations under common control are accounted for using predecessor accounting whereby no assets or liabilities are 
restated to their fair value, instead the predecessor carrying values relating to the acquired entity are used.
3. Revenue 
Revenue represents the work done by the Group under construction contracts during the year excluding Value Added Tax. 
Revenue relates solely to the Group’s principal activities and all work done was carried out within the United Kingdom.
2. Significant accounting policies continued
99 North Midland Construction PLC Annual Report and Accounts for the year ended 31 December 2017
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 25748  3 April 2018 4:52 PM  Proof 14
4. Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation and uncertainty 
4.1 Revenue recognition and valuation of construction contracts within trade and other receivables
The Group uses the percentage-of-completion method in accounting for its construction contracts. Use of the percentage-of-
completion method requires the Group to estimate the construction performed to date as a proportion of the total construction 
to be performed. The estimation of the revenue and profit recognition by reference to the stage of completion can involve 
considerable judgement around future margins. This includes the valuation of construction contract claims, incentive payments 
and variations in the contract work. 
Judgement is also applied in determining when contracts should be aggregated and treated as a single construction contract. 
Where a group of contracts are treated as an aggregated single construction contract the Group has to estimate the percentage 
of construction to date as a proportion of the total construction to be performed, in addition to estimating the future margins and 
any final incentive payments to be received. The use of these estimates is intended to give the most accurate representation of the 
overall future single margin.
The Group reviews these estimates and assumptions as each contract progresses. To the extent that the amounts receivable on 
the contracts are different to the amounts recorded such differences will impact revenue and cost of sales in the period in which 
such determination is made.
Change of accounting policy
The Directors have restated the 2016 construction contracts and trade receivables figures to better reflect the classification 
of those assets in line with the Company policy and to provide reliable and more relevant information to users of the financial 
statements. Trade receivables includes unpaid applications both certified and uncertified, which are reduced accordingly based on 
the stage of completion of a contract when compared to the cash received at the balance sheet date.
Construction contract balances are amounts recoverable over and above any application values included in trade receivables. 
Comparative amounts as at 31 December 2016 have been restated to reflect an increase in trade and other receivables of £7.0m 
in the Group and Company Balance Sheets, Statements of Cash Flows and notes 16, 17 and 28, with a corresponding decrease 
in the construction contracts balance at that date. There has been no effect on profit or retained earnings as a result of the 
restatement.
Trade receivables
The carrying value of trade receivables amounted to £35.23 million (2016 restated: £37.70 million) as at 31 December 2017, in 
relation to £43.69 million (2016 restated: £32.84 million) of applications for payment that have not been certified.
Management have significant experience in making estimates around the percentage-of-completion, based on costs to complete 
and final project out-turn. Although there are likely to be fluctuations on individual contracts, using a portfolio basis the level of 
estimation uncertainty leading to a material adjustment within the next financial year is considered to be low. Estimation uncertainty 
which could have a material impact on the trade receivable asset has been mitigated where necessary by the use of independent 
quantum and legal experts who were assessed by the Directors for their ability, qualifications and experience in this field.
Legacy contracts
Legacy contracts are construction contracts entered into at the height of the recession, before 31 December 2013, and which 
carried a high contractual and commercial risk. These contracts have negatively impacted the Group’s income statement in 2013 
and subsequent years. As at 31 December 2017, there is only one legacy contract remaining. The legacy contract is included 
within trade receivables.
In the year to 31 December 2017, the total loss before tax recognised on legacy contracts was £7.29 million (2016: £3.85 million). 
During the year to 31 December 2016 the Group completed all onsite works for the one remaining legacy contract, therefore 
removing any further uncertainty around costs to fulfil the contract.
Contract revenue on the one remaining legacy contract has been recognised based on the prudent best estimate of the Directors 
as at 31 December 2017 of the amount recoverable from the client. Following a High Court ruling towards the end of 2017, which 
did not support the application of the well-established 'prevention principle' in relation to this contract; the Company has been 
Notes to the Financial Statements
100 North Midland Construction PLC Annual Report and Accounts for the year ended 31 December 2017 25748  3 April 2018 4:52 PM  Proof 14
granted leave to appeal this decision by the Court of Appeal. On the advice of the Company's lawyers the Directors will vigorously 
pursue this appeal, but have decided to make a further provision against the outstanding debt. This matter will be kept under 
constant review and further announcements will be made if appropriate. The Group is and will be pursuing claims with the client for 
sums greater than the carrying value and is in negotiations to settle this balance. The Directors have sought to make the estimate 
as precise as possible by reflecting the views of independent quantum and legal experts who were appointed by the Directors for 
their ability, qualifications and experience in this field.
The independent quantum and legal experts, in conjunction with management, considered a number of factors when making their 
assessment, such as contractual terms, work performed, claims for variations, submissions for extensions of time, claims for loss 
and expense and expected time frames in which settlement in likely.
There are inevitably other external factors involved in the settlement of this balance which may be outside of the Board’s control. 
In consideration of these factors, the Directors have assessed the potential reasonable range of variation on the trade receivable 
asset. This range has been assessed and estimated as an increase or decrease to trade receivables of £1.80 million or £1.60 
million respectively.
Whilst the Directors are making every effort to seek a swift resolution to the matter, they are committed to achieving the best 
possible result for the Group. The ultimate settlement of this matter may take in excess of 12 months to achieve.
Construction contracts
The carrying value of construction contract assets amounted to £14.71 million (2016 restated: £12.18 million) as at 31 December 
2017.
Construction contract assets on the Balance Sheet reflect amounts recoverable on construction contracts relating to small works 
frameworks, manufacture and fabrication projects with low estimation uncertainty, such that there is not considered to be a 
significant risk that their carrying amounts might change materially within the next financial year.
4.2 Deferred tax asset
The carrying value of the deferred tax asset as at 31 December 2017 amounted to £1.22 million (2016: £1.41 million).
The recognition of deferred tax assets primarily relates to the carry forward of unused tax losses. This requires an assessment of 
the extent to which it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the unused tax losses can be utilised. 
Given the recent history of tax losses of the Group, the recognition of this asset requires judgement by the Directors.
The Directors have assessed the recovery of the deferred tax asset, which is considered to be probable on the basis of the trading 
forecast for the Group, indicating sufficient future taxable profits to utilise the tax losses.
5. Reporting segments
The operating segment reporting format reflects the Group’s management and internal reporting structure. 
Operating segments 
The Group is composed of the following operating markets which are conducted in the UK and are effectively market sectors:
• Construction 
• Power
• Highways
• Water
• Telecommunications
Further details of the operating segments’ activities is provided in our Operational Review on pages 28 to 33.
The Group manages its operating segments’ trading performance and working capital by monitoring operating profit and centrally 
manages Group taxation, capital structure and expenditure including equity and net debt.

12. Earnings per share
Earnings per share, both basic and diluted, is calculated on the profit attributable to equity holders of the parent of £742,000 
(2016: £2,634,000) and the weighted average of 10,150,000 (2016: 10,150,000) shares in issue during the year. 
The share awards granted under the performance share plan are considered to be contingently issuable shares that could 
potentially dilute basic earnings per share in the future, but were not included in a calculation of diluted earnings per share because 
they are antidilutive for the year.

The Directors recommend a final dividend of 3p per share for the year ended 31 December 2017 (2016: 3p).
10. Tax continued
Factors that may affect future tax charges
A reduction in the UK corporation tax rate from 21% to 20% (effective from 1 April 2015) was substantively enacted on 2 July 
2013. Further reductions to 19% (effective from 1 April 2017) and to 18% (effective 1 April 2020) were substantively enacted on 26 
October 2015, and an additional reduction to 17% (effective 1 April 2020) was substantively enacted on 6 September 2016. This 
will reduce the Group’s future current tax charge accordingly. The deferred tax asset at 31 December 2017 has been calculated 
based on these rates.

included in trade receivables. Comparative amounts as at 31 December 2016 have been restated above to reflect a decrease 
in amounts recoverable on construction contracts of £7.0m in the Group and Company Balance Sheets, with a corresponding

£1,935,000) were past due as at 31 December 2017, but have not been impaired as the Directors consider these debts to be 
fully recoverable, which is consistent with past default experience. All balances are less than six months overdue except £557,000 
(2016: £277,000).

28. Financial instruments and financial risk management
The Group is exposed through its operations to one or more of the following financial risks:
Interest rate risk
The Group has financed its operations through a mixture of retained profits, a variable rate bank overdraft and finance leases when 
required. The Group manages interest rate risk in respect of surplus cash balances by making deposits with suitable financial 
institutions. Given the level of net funds the Group does not consider the downside interest rate risk to be significant.
Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due. The Group’s approach to 
managing liquidity is to ensure, as far as possible, that it will always have sufficient liquidity to meet its liabilities when due, under 
both normal and stressed conditions, without incurring unacceptable losses or risking damage to the Group’s reputation. 
Typically, the Group ensures that it has sufficient cash on demand to meet expected operational expenses, by the use of its 
overdraft and finance lease contracts, and availability of finance for capital projects before undertaking such projects, including the 
servicing of financial obligations; this excludes the potential impact of extreme circumstances that cannot reasonably be predicted, 
such as natural disasters. Forecasts and budget are approved by the Board to predict expected operational expenses each 
month.
The Group had cash balances at the year end of £17,006,000 (2016: £11,405,000) and has facilities in place to meet all 
anticipated working capital requirements.
Credit risk
The Group extends credit to recognised creditworthy third parties. Trade receivable balances are monitored to minimise the 
Group’s exposure to bad debts. Individual credit limits are set based on internal or external ratings in accordance with limits set 
by the Board. Independent credit ratings are used where available to set suitable credit limits. If there is no independent rating, the 
Board assesses the credit quality of the customer, taking into account its financial position, past experience and other factors. The 
utilisation of credit limits is regularly monitored. At the year end none of the trade receivable balances that were not past due or 
specifically provided against exceed set credit limits and management does not expect any losses from non-performance by these 
counterparties. Credit risk also arises from cash and cash equivalents deposited with financial institutions. The Group deposits its 
surplus funds with only high quality banks and financial institutions with a minimum independent credit rating of A1. Such deposits 
have a maturity of no more than one month. 
The Directors consider that the Group’s relatively diverse operations provide a reduction in concentration risk by sector, geography 
and exposure to individual customers, except the major customer as noted in note 5 where a framework agreement and long-
standing relationship is in place. Loans to/from joint operations are on normal arm’s length terms. There has been no change in the 
Group’s exposure to credit risk or how the risk is managed from the prior year. The carrying amount of financial assets represents 
the Group’s maximum exposure to credit risk at the reporting date assuming that any security held has no value. The Group 
assesses at each balance sheet date whether there is objective evidence that a financial asset or a group of financial assets is 
impaired. The results of impairment testing of trade receivables is described in note 17.

The Company previously advised that on 29 March 2017, SPARK Advisory Partners Limited ("SPARK"), the Company's sponsor 
(in respect of this matter only), notified the Financial Conduct Authority (the "FCA") of a breach of the Listing Rules in relation to the 
related party transactions. SPARK also notified the FCA that the Company has a "controlling shareholder" (being the Moyle family 
and its associates) for the purposes of the Listing Rules in respect of which there is no agreement in place as required by Listing 
Rule 9.
The Company has now received a formal response from the FCA in respect of these breaches of the Listing Rules. The FCA's 
review has now been concluded and they do not intend to take any further action in relation to these matters at the present time. 
The basis of the FCA's decision was due to the following confirmations having been made:
1. SPARK has confirmed to the FCA that the transactions entered into between the Company and Mr R Moyle were fair and 
reasonable as far as the shareholders of the Company were concerned; and
2. SPARK has confirmed to the FCA that agreements, as required by LR 9.2.2AR(2)(a), have been put in place between the 
Company, Mr R Moyle and the Moyle family trusts.

all powers of the Company to allot Relevant Securities up to an aggregate nominal amount of £50,750 (which represents 
approximately 5% of the Company’s issued share capital), provided that (unless previously revoked, varied or renewed) this

the authority had not expired.
 In this Resolution, ‘Relevant Securities’ means shares in the Company or rights to subscribe for or to convert any security into 
shares in the Company; a reference to the allotment of Relevant Securities includes the grant of such a right; and a reference 
to the nominal amount of a Relevant Security which is a right to subscribe for or to convert any security into shares in the

of the Company after the passing of this Resolution or on the date 15 months from the date of the passing of this Resolution 
(whichever is the earlier), save that the Company may make an offer or agreement before this power expires which would or 
might require equity securities to be allotted for cash after this power expires and the Directors may allot equity securities for 
cash pursuant to any such offer or agreement as if this power had not expired.
 This power is in substitution for and shall replace all existing powers (which, to the extent unused at the date of this resolution, 
are revoked with immediate effect).

Company (“Shares”), provided that:

ordinary share capital);

equal to the higher of the price of the last independent trade of a Share and the highest current independent bid for a 
Share on the trading venue where the purchase is carried out and (unless previously revoked, varied or renewed) shall 
expire at the conclusion of the next Annual General Meeting of the Company after the passing of this Resolution or on 
the date 15 months from the date of the passing of this Resolution (whichever is the earlier), save that the Company may 
enter into a contract to purchase Shares before the expiry of this authority under which such purchase will or may be 
completed or executed wholly or partly after this authority expires and may make a purchase of Shares pursuant to any 
such contract as if this authority had not expired.
9. That the articles of association of the Company be amended to take account of certain requirements and authorisations 
provided for in the Act and that these new articles of association be adopted to the exclusion of, and in substitution for, the 
existing articles of association of the Company (and accordingly those provisions which, immediately before 1 October 2009, 
were contained in the Company's memorandum of association and by virtue of section 28 of the Act would otherwise be 
treated as provisions of the Company's articles of association shall no longer apply to the Company); and as contemplated in

making it available on a website; and
ii. the provisions of the Act which apply to sending or supplying a document or information required or authorised to be sent 
or supplied by the Companies Acts (as defined in section 2 of the Act) by making it available on a website shall also apply, 
the necessary changes having been made, to sending or supplying any document or information required or authorised 
to be sent by the Company's articles of association or other rules or regulations to which the Company may be subject by 
making it available on a website.
 An explanation of the main changes to the Company’s articles of association, and the reasons for adopting the electronic 
communications regime, is set out in the Appendix to this Notice. A full copy of the amended articles of association is available 
for inspection on request.

Appendix to Notice of Meeting –  
Explanatory Notes
Resolution 3 - Election/Re-election of Independent Directors
In accordance with the provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code, all current Independent Directors at the date of the 
AGM will retire at the AGM. All Directors, being eligible, offer themselves for election or re-election at the AGM. Short biographical 
details of the Directors are shown on pages 56 and 57 of the Annual Report and Accounts and full details are available on www.
northmid.co.uk.
The Listing Rules require companies that have a controlling shareholder or shareholders to put the election or re-election of 
independent directors to a dual vote of (i) the shareholders as a whole, and (ii) the independent shareholders, being any person 
entitled to vote on the election of directors who is not a controlling shareholder of the Company. Mr IB Speke, Mr MS Garratt 
and Mrs D Hutchinson, as trustees of the 1962 TG Moyle Settlement (24.38%), Robert Moyle together with his wife (4.60%), 
Mr R Moyle, Mrs AEF Moyle and Mr RL Symington, as trustees of the 1996 R Moyle Settlement (6.82%), Mr IB Speke, Mr MS 
Garratt and Mrs D Hutchinson, as trustees of the 1967 TG Moyle Settlement (7.64%) and Mr WEC Cursham and Mr PR Wood, as 
trustees of the William Morris Settlement (8.29%) are each controlling shareholders by virtue of their respective shareholdings in 
the Company. The Independent Directors for these purposes are each of I Elliot, SJT Brown and DP Rogers, who are the Directors 
that the Board has determined are Independent Directors for the purposes of the UK Corporate Governance Code. Resolution 3 is 
therefore being proposed as an ordinary resolution which all shareholders may vote on, but in addition the Company will separately 
count the number of votes cast by independent shareholders in favour of the resolution to determine whether the threshold in (ii) 
above has been met.
As required by the Listing Rules, in respect of each of the Independent Directors, the Company confirms the following:
i. There are no existing or previous relationships, transactions or arrangements between each Independent Director and the 
Company, any of its Directors, any controlling shareholder of the Company or any associate of such a controlling shareholder.
ii. Each of the Independent Directors continues to be effective, to contribute to the performance of the Board and demonstrate 
commitment to his or her role. In addition to the board/committee meetings and AGM, they attend and contribute to executive 
management conferences and investor days, and each of them provide additional support to the Board and the Company on 
a specific area of interest related to his or her skills and experience, as set out on page 57.
iii. The Company has determined that each Independent Director is indeed independent by considering the various relationships 
referred to above and obtaining confirmation from its senior management and the relevant Independent Director that the 
relevant Independent Director was not involved in any decisions relating to the dealings referred to or any other dealing 
between the Independent Director or any organisation with which he or she is connected and the Company, any of its 
directors, any controlling shareholder of the Company or any associates of such a controlling shareholder.
The Company recommends that the Independent Directors should be re-elected as set out in the relevant resolutions.
Under the Listing Rules, if a resolution to re-elect an independent director is not approved by a majority vote of both the 
shareholders as a whole and the independent shareholders of the Company at the AGM, a further resolution may be put forward 
to be approved by the shareholders as a whole at a meeting which must be held more than 90 days after but within 120 days of 
the first vote. Accordingly, if any of Resolution 3 is not approved by a majority vote of the Company’s independent shareholders at 
the AGM, the relevant Director(s) will be treated as having been re-elected only for the period from the date of the AGM until the 
earlier of (i) the close of any general meeting of the Company, convened for a date more than 90 days after the AGM but within 
120 days of the AGM, to propose a further resolution to re-elect him or her, (ii) the date which is 120 days after the AGM and (iii) 
the date of any announcement by the Board that it does not intend to hold a second vote. In the event that the Director’s re-
election is approved by a majority vote of all shareholders at a second meeting, the Director will then be re-elected until the next 
AGM.
Resolution 9 - Adoption of new articles of association
It is proposed in resolution 9 that the Company adopts new articles of association (the “New Articles”) in order to update the 
Company’s current articles of association (the “Current Articles”) primarily to ensure the articles are up to date with electronic 
communications legislation.
The principal changes introduced in the New Articles are summarised below. Other changes, which are of a minor, technical or 
clarifying nature or conform the language of the New Articles with that used in the model articles for public companies produced 
by the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills have not been noted below. The New Articles are available for inspection, as 
noted on page 116.
117 North Midland Construction PLC Annual Report and Accounts for the year ended 31 December 2017
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 25748  3 April 2018 4:52 PM  Proof 14
1. The Company’s objects
The provisions regulating the operations of the Company are currently set out in the Company’s memorandum and articles of 
association. The Company’s memorandum contains, among other things, the objects clause which sets out the scope of the 
activities the Company is authorised to undertake. This is drafted to give a wide scope. 
 
The Act significantly reduces the constitutional significance of a company’s memorandum and provides that a memorandum will 
record only the names of subscribers and the number of shares each subscriber has agreed to take in the company. Under the 
Act the objects clause and all other provisions which are contained in a company’s memorandum, for existing companies at 1 
October 2009, are deemed to be contained in the company’s articles of association but the company can remove these provisions 
by special resolution. 
 
Further the Act states that unless a company’s articles provide otherwise, a company’s objects are unrestricted. This abolishes 
the need for companies to have objects clauses. For this reason the Company is proposing to remove its objects clause together 
with all other provisions of its memorandum which, by virtue of the Act, are treated as forming part of the Company’s articles of 
association as of 1 October 2009. Resolution 9 confirms the removal of these provisions for the Company. As the effect of this 
resolution will be to remove the statement currently in the Company’s memorandum of association regarding limited liability, the 
New Articles also contain an express statement regarding the limited liability of shareholders.
2. Articles which duplicate statutory provisions
Provisions in the Current Articles which replicate provisions contained in the Act are in the main amended to bring them into line 
with the Act.
3. Change of name
Under the Companies Act 1985, a company could only change its name by special resolution. Under the Act a company will be 
able to change its name by other means provided for by its articles. To take advantage of this provision, the New Articles enable 
the Directors to pass a resolution to change the Company’s name.
4. Authorised share capital and unissued shares
The Act abolishes the requirement for a company to have an authorised share capital and the New Articles reflect this. Directors 
will still be limited as to the number of shares they can at any time allot because allotment authority continues to be required under 
the Act, save in respect of employee share schemes.
5. Redeemable shares
Under the Companies Act 1985, if a company wished to issue redeemable shares, it had to include in its articles the terms and 
manner of redemption. The Act enables directors to determine such matters instead provided they are so authorised by the 
articles. The New Articles contain such an authorisation. The Company has no plans to issue redeemable shares but if it did so the 
Directors would need shareholders’ authority to issue new shares in the usual way. 
6. Authority to purchase own shares, consolidate and sub-divide shares, and reduce share capital
Under the Companies Act 1985, a company required specific enabling provisions in its articles to purchase its own shares, 
to consolidate or sub-divide its shares and to reduce its share capital or other undistributable reserves as well as shareholder 
authority to undertake the relevant action. The Current Articles include these enabling provisions. Under the Act a company will 
only require shareholder authority to do any of these things and it will no longer be necessary for articles to contain enabling 
provisions. Accordingly the relevant enabling provisions have been removed in the New Articles.
7. Provision for employees on cessation of business
The Act provides that the powers of the directors of a company to make provision for a person employed or formerly employed 
by the company or any of its subsidiaries in connection with the cessation or transfer to any person of the whole or part of the 
undertaking of the company or that subsidiary, may only be exercised by the directors if they are so authorised by the company’s 
articles or by the company in general meeting. The New Articles provide that the Directors may exercise this power.

Explanatory Notes

8. Use of seals
Under the Companies Act 1985, a company required authority in its articles to have an official seal for use abroad. Under the Act, 
such authority will no longer be required. Accordingly, the relevant authorisation has been removed in the New Articles.
The New Articles provide an alternative option for execution of documents (other than share certificates). Under the New Articles, 
when the seal is affixed to a document it may be signed by one authorised person in the presence of a witness, whereas 
previously the requirement was for signature by either a director and the secretary or two directors or such other person or 
persons as the directors may approve.
9. Suspension of registration of share transfers
The Current Articles permit the Directors to suspend the registration of transfers. Under the Act share transfers must be registered 
as soon as practicable. The power in the Current Articles to suspend the registration of transfers is inconsistent with this 
requirement. Accordingly, this power has been removed in the New Articles.
10. Vacation of office by directors
The Current Articles specify the circumstances in which a director must vacate office. The New Articles update these provisions 
to reflect the approach taken on mental and physical incapacity in the model articles for public companies produced by the 
Department for Business, Innovation and Skills.
11. Electronic conduct of meetings
Amendments made to the Act by the Shareholders’ Rights Regulations specifically provide for the holding and conducting of 
electronic meetings. The Current Articles have been amended to reflect more closely the relevant provisions.
12. Electronic communications
The New Articles have been updated to allow the Company to apply electronic communications rules to documents and 
information to be sent under its articles of association, as well as documents and information required or permitted to be sent 
under the Act and under other rules or regulations including the Listing Rules. The Act requires certain conditions to be met before 
a company can take advantage of the new rules, including that the Company must notify shareholders by post or electronically 
that the relevant document is available on the website. The New Articles allow the Company to use electronic communications 
with shareholders as the default position by placing any documents or information, including the annual report and accounts, on 
a website rather than sending such documents or information to shareholders in hard copy. Shareholders may also ask for a hard 
copy of any document at any time.
The Company is asking each shareholder individually to agree that the Company may send or supply documents or information 
by means of a website, subject to Resolution 9 being passed. This request is included with this letter and explains that, if the 
Company has not received a response within 28 days beginning with the day of the request, the shareholder will be taken to have 
agreed. This request is being sent to all shareholders, (including those who have already agreed to website publication), so that in 
the future the Company has a single regime applicable to all shareholders. Even if a shareholder fails to respond, and is taken to 
agree to website publication, he or she can ask for a hard copy of any document from the Company at any time.
The Company will send a notification to shareholders to alert them to the publication of the relevant document when a document 
or information is made available on the website. Shareholders may choose to receive this notification in hard copy form or by 
email. The new arrangements are expected to save considerable administrative, printing and postage costs, while preserving 
shareholders’ rights to receive hard copy documents if they wish.
13. General
Generally the opportunity has been taken to bring clearer language into the New Articles and in some areas to conform the 
language of the New Articles with that used in the model articles for public companies produced by the Department for Business, 
Innovation and Skills.
