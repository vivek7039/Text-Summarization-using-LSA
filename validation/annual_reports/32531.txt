This is my first review as Chairman of Oxford 
Instruments plc, a position I am delighted to 
have taken on at our AGM in September. 
It has been a year of structural, operational 
and strategic transition for the Group. We 
have a new and energised senior executive 
team led by Ian Barkshire and Gavin Hill. 
They have acted with impressive decisiveness 
in embedding a number of changes in our 
operating teams to raise the talent bar across 
our business.
We have also made good progress in 
developing and implementing the new 
Horizon strategy to reposition our Group 
for long‑term sustainable growth. This has 
seen some significant actions to manage 
our portfolio of businesses with the aim of 
accelerating our delivery of shareholder value. 
In November, we announced the disposal of 
our underperforming wire business, Oxford 
Superconducting Technology, and since the 
year end, we have announced the agreed sale 
of our Industrial Analysis business to Hitachi 
High‑Technologies. 
Chairman’s Statement
As Ian Barkshire sets out in his Chief 
Executive’s Review, the management 
team is now implementing the next phase 
of the Horizon strategy to continue the 
transformation of Oxford Instruments. This is 
focused around the two anchors of returning 
to sustainable growth and improving margins 
by concentrating on market segments with 
long‑term growth drivers where we have 
the potential to become the market leader.
The business delivered a stable performance in line  
with our expectations against an extremely challenging 
market backdrop.
We have made good 
progress in developing 
and implementing the 
new Horizon strategy.

Against this background of strategic 
activity, the team maintained the focus 
on short‑term performance. The business 
delivered a stable performance in line with 
our expectations against an extremely 
challenging market backdrop of slower 
academic funding in the US and Europe and 
the anticipated deterioration in the financial 
performance of our OI Healthcare business. 
Our NanoTechnology Tools sector performed 
strongly and we saw good returns from the 
servicing of our own products. These growth 
businesses provide the platform for our 
future growth.
Adjusted basic earnings per share on a 
continuing basis grew by 5.5%. However, 
taking into account the impact on the Group 
of business disposals, currency effects and 
our progressive strengthening of the balance 
sheet, the Board has proposed to hold the 
dividend at last year’s level. This results in a 
final dividend of 9.3 pence (2016: 9.3 pence) 
bringing the total dividend for the year to 
13.0 pence (2016: 13.0 pence).
I am pleased that Stephen Blair will join the 
Board on 1 July 2017 as Senior Independent 
Director. He brings with him a wide range of 
international experience and sound technical 
understanding that was gained during his time 
at a number of top technical companies, such 
as e2v and Spectris. 
Finally, I would like to thank the Board for their 
ongoing support during this time of change 
and for their commitment to repositioning 
Oxford Instruments to deliver long‑term 
profitable growth, providing sustainable 
value for our Shareholders.

Chief Executive’s Review
I am encouraged by the 
performance of the Group 
during my first year as Chief 
Executive, having made good 
progress in strengthening the 
business and positioning it for 
the future. The year has been 
one of transition with a new 
strategy, associated portfolio 
changes and the formation  
of a new leadership team.
The most notable strategic development has 
been the launch of the Horizon strategy, our 
transformational programme for the Group, 
which will drive both our future direction and 
our operational model. Horizon will build on 
our strengths, brand and innovation heritage 
and has the following key elements: 
• We will focus our investment on market 
segments where nanotechnology drives 
long‑term growth for our customers 
and where we can maintain or develop 
leadership positions.
• We will migrate to being a more 
commercially focused, market‑driven 
Group by maintaining our heritage in 
supporting fundamental research whilst 
increasing our focus on products for 
applied R&D and the commercialisation 
of nanotechnology. 
• We will drive the delivery of synergies and 
enhanced collaboration. For example, in 
R&D we will prioritise our high‑impact 
projects and resource them from across 
the Group.
• We will evolve our existing “tools and 
service” model and move up the value 
chain by providing our customers with 
enhanced solutions, information and 
support that will drive advances in 
innovation and productivity. 
• We will transform our operational model 
to embed consistency and excellence 
across our businesses, measured by clearly 
defined core capabilities that will enhance 
our competitive advantage. 
Over the past ten years, Oxford Instruments 
has focused on being a leading provider 
of high technology tools and service to 
research communities all over the world. 
Nanotechnology is now well established 
as a fundamental and integral driver for 
delivering advances across the sciences and 
commercial end markets. We will build on 
our leadership and expertise in the fabrication, 
manipulation and analysis of materials down 
to the molecular and atomic scale. We will 
support the changing needs of our customers 
by evolving to become a leading provider of 
high technology solutions, information 
and support. We will be known for 
unprecedented performance, ease of use and 
service that will add value to our customers’ 
capabilities and productivity. 
The year has been one of transition with a new strategy, 
associated portfolio changes and the formation of a new 
leadership team.
Summary
• Horizon strategy underway, 
repositioning the Group for  
long‑term growth
• Continued strength and 
improved profitability across 
NanoTechnology Tools sector
• Steady performance in 
Industrial Products 
• Increased demand for services 
related to our own products 01: Strategic Report 02: Governance 03: Financial Statements 04: Company Information

New operational model
Within Horizon, we will actively manage our 
portfolio of businesses and products, selecting 
those markets with long‑term growth drivers 
where we can maintain or grow leading 
positions. We will focus on those markets 
where nanotechnology has the potential to 
address some of the world’s most complex and 
pressing challenges and where we can deliver 
enhanced solutions and service excellence. 
Global drivers for our core markets are: 
Healthcare where growth is driven by 
demand for improvements in disease detection 
and the understanding of fundamental 
mechanisms;
• Our advanced imaging and analysis 
solutions, such as our Dragonfly optical 
system and our newly launched video 
rate Atomic Force Microscope are 
examples of where we are providing 
enhanced capabilities and productivity 
for investigators working in this area.
Energy where improved efficiencies and 
sustainability remain core drivers, and includes 
work in photovoltaics and batteries.
• Our deposition and etch processes, and 
our characterisation solutions are essential 
for our customers in the development of 
their current and next generation devices. 
Plasma Technology, Asylum Research 
and NanoAnalysis are particularly well 
aligned to support these markets with new 
processing and characterisation capabilities.
IT and Communications where there is 
a focus on speed, security and capacity.
• Again, it is our ability to provide the 
fabrication capabilities for new materials 
and device structures, and the subsequent 
characterisation of their performance 
that helps our customers, for example 
in photonics, semiconductors and data 
storage devices. Our solutions are being 
utilised by fundamental science right 
through to the practical application of new 
materials within this area, and will support 
growth across our NanoTechnology 
Tools portfolio. 
We have made notable progress in establishing a more 
synergistic portfolio.

Advanced Materials where we can help 
customers lead the race to develop lighter, 
stronger, higher functioning and more 
affordable materials.
• This remains a core market for our 
businesses and we continue to build 
strong relationships with the leaders in this 
field, ranging from Nobel Prize winners 
through to Quality Assurance for leading 
manufacturers.
Quantum Technology is the exploitation of 
the regime where quantum effects dominate 
and radically change the ‘rule book’ of 
what is possible. For example, the quantum 
interaction between remote particles has 
the potential for new paradigms in secure 
communications, computing and sensors.
• Our cryogenics, advanced fabrication, 
imaging and characterisation capabilities 
are all critical to the advancement of 
this field.
Within our core markets, we have identified a 
number of niche segments that are particularly 
attractive to us, such as biodynamics, quantum 
computing and advanced batteries, where we 
will focus to gain competitive advantage.
As part of Horizon we have undertaken a 
strategic review of the growth opportunities, 
competitive landscapes and leadership 
capabilities across the Group to inform 
our portfolio management. We have 
made notable progress in establishing 
a more synergistic portfolio. In November, 
we announced the disposal of our 
Superconducting Wire business and since the 
year end we have announced the agreed sale 
of our Industrial Analysis business to Hitachi 
High‑Technologies. 
Horizon will change the way by which we 
operate and will embed clearly defined core 
capabilities across our businesses in the 
following areas: 
Market Intimacy: We will further develop 
in‑depth understanding of our customer 
segments and align our innovation and 
product development initiatives to customers’ 
strategic roadmaps.
Innovation and Product Development: 
We will focus our R&D investment on higher 
growth segments, prioritising our efforts 
on the most valuable product development 
opportunities. 
Customer Support: We will build on the 
growing customer demand and offer a 
higher level and broader range of services 
and support. 
Operational Excellence: We will drive 
improvements in cost, time and defects 
to become a more delivery and outcome 
focused business. 
Horizon will drive a culture of continuous 
improvement and best practice across all 
of our businesses, which will deliver clear 
competitive advantage and long‑term 
shareholder value. I am excited by the 
potential of the Horizon strategy which 
builds on our heritage and is the next stage 
in the evolution and commercialisation of 
Oxford Instruments.

Chief Executive’s Review continued
Results
Looking back over the previous financial year, 
the Group delivered a stable performance, 
supported by stronger second‑half trading 
in line with our expectations and currency 
tailwinds. This was despite an uncertain 
macroeconomic background, which has seen 
a sustained period of slow global academic 
and R&D funding and continued softness 
across industrial end markets. 
Progress in the year has been underpinned 
by the continued strength and improved 
profitability across our NanoTechnology 
Tools Sector. Industrial Products delivered 
a steady performance against continued 
challenging end markets supported by new 
product launches. In our Service sector, the 
increased demand for services related to our 
own products was more than offset by the 
previously flagged weaker performance from 
our OI Healthcare business in the US.
Orders in the period increased by 4.3% 
to £350.7 million (2016: £336.1 million), 
orders at constant currency were down 
7.3%, predominantly due to lower orders 
in OI Healthcare and Industrial Analysis. 
Orders in NanoTechnology Tools increased 
by 7.9% but were marginally down on the 
previous year at constant currency. The order 
book for future deliveries at the end of the 
year increased by 9.3% to £144.5 million 
(2016: £132.2 million), representing a 
constant currency increase of 0.5% at a Group 
level and 0.5% and 5.0% for NanoTechnology 
Tools and Service respectively.
Reported revenue in the period was up 9.0% 
to £348.5 million (2016: £319.7 million), 
down 3.7% at constant currency, reflecting 
the weaker performance across our Industrial 
Products and OI Healthcare businesses. On a 
geographical basis, demand for our products 
reflected global trends in funding and capital 
expenditure, resulting in an exceptionally 
strong performance in Asia, growth in Europe 
and a relatively flat performance in the USA. 
Reported revenue grew in Europe, North 
America and Asia by 4.2%, 0.7% and 22.3% 
respectively. Revenue on a constant currency 
basis grew 7.2% in Asia supported by 
continued strong growth in China. Constant 
currency revenue declined in Europe by 
5.9% with growth in France and Germany 
being more than offset by reduced volumes 
from the Rest of Europe, principally from 
lower shipments from Plasma Technology, 
and it declined in North America by 12.0%, 
predominantly due to reduced volumes in 
OI Healthcare and Asylum Research.
Adjusted profit before tax from continuing 
operations increased by 7.1% to £36.0 million 
(2016: £33.6 million) with improvements 
across NanoTechnology Tools and Industrial 
Products more than offsetting a fall in Service. 
Adjusted operating profit margin fell to 
12.2% (2016: 12.9%) reflecting the reduced 
profit from OI Healthcare and the uplift to 
revenue due to the movement in currency 
exchange rates.
We recorded a loss before tax of £25.5 million 
after the impairment of non‑current assets 
and other adjusting items of £45.8 million, 
primarily reflecting deterioration in the 
financial performance from Asylum Research, 
OI Healthcare and our joint venture, 
ScientaOmicron. While we have plans 
that address the weaknesses and issues 
within all three businesses, the impairment 
reflects the actions and time required to 
improve profitability. 
Continuing adjusted basic EPS grew by 5.5% 
to 47.8 pence (2016: 45.3 pence). Basic EPS 
was a negative 44.0 pence (2016: 12.2 pence) 
after reflecting the impairments of non‑current 
assets and other adjusting items. 
Net debt at the end of the period fell to 
£109.3 million (2016: £128.2 million), largely 
due to good cash conversion and proceeds 
received from the sale of Superconducting 
Wire business in November 2016. 
Turning to the individual sectors: 
NanoTechnology Tools saw reported 
revenue growth of 11.4% to £208.7 million 
(2016: £187.4 million), adjusted operating 
profit grew 20.2% to £25.6 million 
(2016: £21.3 million), with an increase in 
adjusted operating margin by 90 basis points 
to 12.3%. The improved performance is 
due to the success of recently launched 
higher margin products across the portfolio 
combined with a focus on operational 
efficiencies. We continued to see enhanced 
performance from Andor Technology and 
NanoAnalysis; while Plasma Technology and 
NanoScience both continued to make progress 
in the year and contributed strongly to the 
improved performance. Asylum Research 
underperformed against the previous year 
having been disproportionally impacted 
by reduced academic funding levels and a 
delay in launching new products. As a result 
of prioritising investments and delivering 
operational efficiencies we expect to see an 
improvement in the profitability of the Asylum 
business, albeit still below original projections 
at the time of acquisition. 
Progress in the year has been underpinned by the 
continued strength and improved profitability across  
our NanoTechnology Tools Sector. 01: Strategic Report 02: Governance 03: Financial Statements 04: Company Information
Oxford Instruments plc Report and Financial Statements 2017 09
In Industrial Products, reported revenue 
increased by 5.0% to £56.7 million 
(2016: £54.0 million), excluding discontinued 
contributions from the Superconducting Wire 
business, which was divested in November. 
Reported adjusted operating profit increased 
to £1.7 million (2016: £1.1 million) with 
an associated increase of 100 basis points 
in adjusted operating margin to 3.0%. 
This represents a stable performance 
in the face of continued challenging 
end‑market conditions. 
In Service, reported revenue increased by 
6.1% to £83.2 million (2016: £78.4 million). 
This was driven by the increased demand 
for services relating to our own products. 
As previously flagged, the OI Healthcare 
business in the US, which offers refurbished 
imaging systems, mobile imaging solutions 
and maintenance services, had a slower year 
due to a change in the software licensing 
policy on second hand systems by one of the 
main system manufacturers. This significantly 
reduced the number of refurbished systems 
sold in the year and, despite improved profit 
and operational margin from the servicing of 
our own products, resulted in a fall in reported 
adjusted operating profit to £15.2 million 
(2016: £18.8 million). We have taken the 
necessary actions to align the business to the 
new software licensing model for refurbished 
imaging systems and the OI Healthcare 
business is now positioned to deliver an 
improved performance going forward. 
From a customer perspective, our end‑market 
distribution has remained relatively unchanged 
compared to the previous year. Over half of 
the Group’s revenue came from academic and 
commercial research customers, of which a 
quarter was engaged in Bio and Life Sciences. 
The Group continues to invest in future 
products and services and in the year we 
increased investment in R&D by 7.1% 
to £30.3 million (2016: £28.3 million). 
We monitor the proportion of our revenue 
which originates from products launched in 
the last three years (our Vitality Index). Our 
Vitality Index stands at 31%, and is in the 
range we expect from a high technology 
business. This reflects the continued strength 
of our existing leading products and the 
successful uptake of more recently launched 
products. Some of the new products launched 
in the year are outlined in the Operational 
Review. We continue to have a healthy 
pipeline of new products in development 
that push the boundaries of scientific 
understanding and technical performance 
and increase our market reach.
People
Our staff are central to the successful delivery 
of our Horizon strategy. We will focus on 
resourcing our core capabilities through the 
development of our existing workforce and 
targeted recruitment. 
To further support the delivery of Horizon, 
I have reshaped our Management Board. 
The Management Board develops and 
embeds our business processes across the 
Group and the new structure will drive the 
exploitation of synergies and efficiencies 
across our businesses. 
The progress we have made so far in our 
transformation is largely due to the talented 
workforce we have at Oxford Instruments. 
I would like to thank all our employees 
for their positive response to the new 
strategy and the resulting changes, their 
continued enthusiasm and their dedication 
to our customers.
Outlook
In a year of transition, the Group delivered a 
stable performance, supported by currency 
tailwinds. Whilst academic and R&D funding 
levels remain uncertain, we believe that 
progress with our strategic initiatives and 
favourable currency effects will deliver an 
outcome for the year in line with expectations.
Our focus is on markets with long‑term 
growth drivers where nanotechnology has 
the potential to address some of the world’s 
most complex and pressing challenges. 
Fundamental improvements to our structure, 
operations and strategy are underway 
and give us a solid platform to return to 
sustainable growth, at improved margins 
over the medium term.

contamination-controlled conditions in a cleanroom. 01: Strategic Report 02: Governance 03: Financial Statements 04: Company Information
Oxford Instruments plc Report and Financial Statements 2017 15
Our NanoTechnology Tools sector experienced  
continued strength and improved profitability. 
The NanoTechnology Tools sector comprises 
two divisions: NanoCharacterisation, which 
includes NanoAnalysis, Andor Technology and 
Asylum Research; and NanoSolutions, which 
includes NanoScience, Plasma Technology and 
our minority share in the ScientaOmicron JV. 
Our NanoTechnology Tools sector experienced 
continued strength and improved profitability. 
This was largely due to the success of recently 
launched, higher margin products and an 
ongoing focus on operational efficiencies 
across the sector. Whilst overall academic 
funding remains subdued, we continue 
to see demand in the nanotechnology 
arena, including the characterisation of 
materials associated with current and next 
generation batteries; biomedical imaging in 
the exploration and improved understanding 
of disease mechanisms and with particular 
growth in the newly emerging quantum 
technology segment. In addition we are 
seeing an increased demand from commercial 
organisations seeking to gain competitive 
advantage from the exploitation of 
nanotechnology. Our focus on solutions that 
offer increased performance and ease of use 
is creating more value for our academic and 
commercial customers, providing them with 
new capabilities, additional information and 
higher productivity.
Our NanoAnalysis business delivers innovative 
solutions and services that enable materials 
characterisation and sample manipulation 
down to the nanoscale. Our products 
are used in conjunction with electron 
microscopes and ion‑beam systems to 
provide the critical compositional, structural 
and phase information that determines 
material properties from plastics through 
to advanced aerospace components and 
quantum devices. Our solutions are market 
leading, being used in most of the world’s 
leading academic institutions and companies, 
with applications ranging from renewable 
energy storage, semiconductors, advanced 
materials research, mining, metallurgy and 
forensics. NanoAnalysis continues to deliver 
a strong technical and financial performance 
in a relatively stable market. We continue 
to extend our range of products, and have 
experienced particular success providing 
analytical systems supporting production 
in commercial applications such as data 
storage and automotive markets. In addition, 
our flagship XMax Extreme product has 
delivered strong growth since its launch in 
the previous year, with customers using its 
unique performance to undertake materials 
research at a resolution and sensitivity that 
was previously unobtainable.

Operations Review continued
In particular, Extreme offered researchers 
new capabilities to characterise current and 
next generation batteries and semiconductor 
structures at the nanoscale. Whilst the metals 
markets remained subdued during the year, 
we saw increasing interest and positive 
developments in the Advanced Materials and 
Biomedical markets driven by investment 
in new manufacturing technologies, such 
as additive manufacturing and a continued 
investment in biomedical research.
Andor Technology is a global leader in the 
design and manufacture of high performance 
scientific imaging cameras, spectroscopy 
solutions and microscopy systems for research 
and industrial markets. During the year, 
Andor continued to build sales and service 
presence and expand the portfolio of imaging 
and microscopy solutions. We significantly 
enhanced our offering into combustion and 
plasma research markets with the launch of 
an intensified camera solution with market 
leading speed and sensitivity. Several of 
our core technologies have been adopted 
by quantum imaging researchers who are 
studying quantum applications including 
quantum communication and quantum 
computing. At the core of our microscopy 
business strategy was the launch this year 
of our Dragonfly confocal microscope 
platform and its associated experiment 
sequencing software, Fusion. Combined, 
these investments have received exceptional 
customer feedback as they enable 3D imaging 
through thicker samples and larger areas 
at unprecedented resolution and speed. 
A solid order book, dedicated sales team 
and customer interest support our high 
expectations of this segment in the next 
financial year and beyond. The year also 
delivered exceptional performance from our 
associated analysis software platform Imaris, 
where we continue to embrace our customers’ 
need to manage and process large complex 
data sets, often derived from our Dragonfly 
systems. Imaris will deliver smooth handling 
of extremely large data sets, which are a core 
requirement for the growing brain imaging 
market sector.
Asylum Research is the technology leader 
in atomic force microscopy (“AFM”) for 
both materials and bioscience applications. 
While Asylum continues to take a leadership 
position when it comes to advanced 
technology, this was a difficult year for us 
and other AFM providers. The market has 
been disproportionately impacted by reduced 
academic funding levels in the US and 
Europe and for us this has offset a stronger 
performance in Asia. Increased interest 
in battery energy storage, photovoltaics, 
industrial polymers and two dimensional 
materials such as graphene contributed 
to a stronger second half to the year. Our 
electrochemistry solution, which is based 
on our Cypher AFM platform, enables the 
measurement and observation in real time of 
reactions for critical processes in their normal 
environment. This is particularly important 
for battery research where the electrolyte, 
temperature and electrical bias all affect 
performance and chemical response. Towards 
the end of the year we launched our Video 
Rate (“VRS”) AFM which is also based on the 
versatile Cypher platform. It is the first and 
only full‑featured video‑rate atomic force 
microscope and sets a new benchmark for 
speed, enabling high resolution imaging of 
dynamic events at the nanoscale across a 
range of applications including biodynamics, 
cosmetics, pharmaceuticals, semiconductor 
processing and catalysis. 
Plasma Technology provides material etch 
and deposition processes and solutions to 
semiconductor research laboratories and 
advanced specialised production facilities 
that develop devices and materials for novel 
applications in nanotechnology. Our focus 
on developing advanced process recipes 
to complement our etch and deposition 
platforms, combined with a focus on 
operational effectiveness, has helped deliver 
a significant improvement in the performance 
of the business. Our proprietary processes 
have helped us to win a number of orders 
into specialist production facilities for 
power semiconductors and the production 
of sensors. Our new hardware platforms 
are delivering the anticipated operational 
improvements and efficiencies through their 
increasing standardisation and modular 
design. We expect to see continuing interest 
from nanotechnology research with building 
interest in our solutions for atomic‑scale 
processing of materials for power conversion 
and storage. We were pleased to receive the 
‘High Volume Manufacturing’ award from 
the Compound Semiconductor industry 
recognising our development of SiC plasma 
etch processes, which are delivered through 
our PlasmaPro 100 Polaris system launched 
in the previous year.

NanoScience designs, manufactures and 
supports market‑leading products that create 
unique environments and measurement 
solutions primarily for the physical science and 
quantum technology research community. 
Our portfolio includes ultra‑low temperature 
cryogenic systems, specialised high field 
superconducting magnets and associated 
measurement solutions which are enabling 
the advances in quantum technologies, new 
materials and device development as well as 
fundamental research in the physical sciences. 
Demand for our specialist magnet systems 
remains strong, including installations into 
leading institutes across China, Europe and 
the US. In addition, increased investment in 
existing beamline facilities drove demand 
for high value, specialised superconducting 
magnet systems. In the year we made 
successful installations into several leading 
facilities including OakRidge National 
Laboratory in the US and the Rutherford 
Appleton Laboratory in the UK. We have 
benefited from the global increase of funding 
into quantum‑related technologies, fuelled by 
quantum computing and quantum sensors in 
particular. This has driven increased demand 
across our cryogenic and related optical 
measurement solutions. Our market leading 
portfolio of cryogenic and measurement 
solutions are well positioned to benefit from 
the forecast increase in quantum funding 
initiatives across Europe, the US and China. 
The ScientaOmicron joint venture created 
the largest player in the Ultra‑High Vacuum 
surface science field. While the integration and 
ongoing restructuring continue, the business 
has been impacted by the subdued academic 
funding and slower than planned product 
launches. This is being addressed by more 
focused investment to address product gaps 
and a continued focus on driving operational 
efficiencies. The Group has a 47% share in the 
joint venture. 
A loss before tax of £17.4 million (2016: profit 
of £9.0 million) for NanoTechnology Tools is 
after the impairment of non‑current assets, 
amortisation of acquired intangibles and other 
adjusting items. Total impairment costs of 
£31.3 million relate to Asylum (£23.3 million) 
and ScientaOmicron (£8.0 million). 
Amortisation of acquired intangibles 
was £10.6 million. Other adjusting items 
comprise £0.8 million of charges relating to 
ScientaOmicron and acquisition related costs 
of £0.3 million. 
We are seeing an increased demand from commercial 
organisations seeking to gain competitive advantage 
from the exploitation of nanotechnology.

After the previously announced disposal 
of our Superconducting Wire business, 
Industrial Products comprises the X‑ray 
Technology, Magnetic Resonance and 
Industrial Analysis businesses. Since the close 
of the year, we have announced the agreed 
sale of our Industrial Analysis business to 
Hitachi High‑Technologies in line with our 
Horizon strategy. 
The sector experienced a stable performance 
given the continued challenging end 
market conditions driven by subdued oil 
and commodity prices and reduced steel 
production in China. The launch of new 
products, combined with improved efficiencies 
across this sector, maintained a stable 
performance from the Industrial portfolio. 
Our X‑ray Technology business supplies 
X‑ray sources to leading OEMs for industry, 
research and medical applications including 
material composition analysis, real‑time 
medical imaging and analysis of multi‑layer 
printed circuit boards. X‑ray Technology made 
progress in the year despite challenging 
markets. While growth of traditional 
laboratory and ROHS‑driven analysis markets 
have slowed, the imaging markets and 
industrial analysis markets are becoming 
an increasingly important part of our 
market focus.

Industrial Analysis designs and sells a range 
of spectrometers into a broad range of 
industrial markets. Our customers span global 
industries from metals, steel foundries and 
scrap recycling through to automotive, solar, 
petrochemicals, cement, recycling, and food 
and agriculture. The business reinforced its 
market position through a number of key 
product launches across our Optical Emission 
Spectroscopy and Hand Held Analyser 
portfolio. For example, our recently launched 
Vulcan handheld laser induced breakdown 
spectroscopy analyser, offers portable 
analysis at lower cost and without ionising 
radiation. Vulcan has had a successful take 
up since launch and is targeted at quality 
control applications in general manufacturing 
as well as metals recycling. In the year we 
also added the “Optimum” model to the 
FOUNDRY‑MASTER range of compact optical 
emission spectrometers, which provides 
unparalleled analytical performance for the 
entry‑level quality assurance, quality control 
and metal production applications. 
A loss before tax of £2.1 million (2016: loss 
of £3.1 million) is after the impairment 
of non‑current assets, amortisation of 
acquired intangibles and other adjusting 
items. Total impairment costs of £1.1 million 
relate to a write‑down of superseded 
intellectual property within Industrial Analysis. 
Amortisation of acquired intangibles was 
£1.3 million. Other adjusting items comprise 
£0.2 million of restructuring charges and 
acquisition related costs of £1.2 million.
The consumer electronics, printed circuit board 
inspection and oil and gas markets continued 
to be subdued. However, there was growth 
in medical imaging applications as demand 
for mini and micro CT, bone density and 
biopsy equipment increased, driven by trends 
in reduced footprint, portability and reduced 
patient dosage. Battery inspection is another 
increasing application area and we are further 
improving our products to provide enhanced 
offerings to this sector. The regulatory 
legislations that were expected in China to 
control metals in food and water have not 
yet materialised and represent potential 
future growth. 
Our Magnetic Resonance business uses 
fundamental physical processes to provide 
essential information about the nature 
and behaviour of materials and products. 
We provide instruments to academic and 
industrial researchers that are simple to 
operate, providing essential information 
that relates directly to the performance of 
our customers’ products. We continue to 
see interest in Pulsar, the highest resolution 
benchtop NMR spectrometer on the market. 
Pulsar is an affordable system that allows 
researchers to have their own NMR analyser 
in‑house rather than having to go to high cost, 
low throughput specialist service laboratories.  20 Oxford Instruments plc Report and Financial Statements 2017

The Service sector comprises the Group’s 
maintenance service contracts, billable repairs 
and spare part sales for Oxford Instruments’ 
own products; and the service, sale and 
rental of refurbished third party MRI and 
CT machines under the OI Healthcare brand.
The improved profit and operational margin 
we saw from the servicing of our own 
products was unfortunately offset by a poor 
performance in our OI Healthcare business. 
The OI Healthcare business in the US, which 
offers refurbished imaging systems, mobile 
imaging solutions and maintenance services, 
was impacted by a change in the software 
licensing policy on second‑hand systems by 
one of the main system manufacturers and by 
the high level of activity in the comparative 
period. As a result, the number of refurbished 
systems sold in the year and revenue 
generated from leasing were significantly 
reduced. We are taking the necessary steps 
to improve sustainable profitability, including 
driving operational efficiencies and improving 
management capabilities in specific areas 
of focus.

1. Calculated as adjusted operating profit divided by revenue.
2. Cash conversion is defined as the ratio of adjusted operating cash generated to adjusted operating profit (see Income Statement). Adjusted operating cash is defined as adjusted EBITDA, less 
movement in working capital, capitalised development expenditure and net capital expenditure on property, plant and equipment.
3. Calculated as adjusted operating profit less amortisation (but before impairment) of intangible assets divided by capital employed. Capital employed is defined as assets (excluding cash, tax and 
derivative assets) less liabilities (excluding tax, debt, derivative and pension liabilities).
4. To ensure this metric better reflects the performance of those business which invest in R&D, the revenue from the Group’s OI Healthcare division has been excluded from this metric. 
Results from previous years have been restated to show this.
5. The Net Promoter Score is a metric which is compiled by asking customers whether they would recommend Oxford Instruments to a friend or colleague. Customers give a score between zero 
and ten. Those customers who score nine or ten are promoters, those customers who score seven or eight are neutral and customers who score six or less are detractors. The net promoter 
score is the difference between the numbers of promoters and the number of detractors (both expressed as a percentage of the number of replies received). The score can range between 
‑100 (no customers are promoters) and +100 (all customers are promoters). A positive score indicates that the Company has fewer detractors than promoters.  01: Strategic Report 02: Governance 03: Financial Statements 04: Company Information

Viability Statement
In accordance with provision C.2.2 of the 
UK Corporate Governance Code 2014, the 
Directors have performed an assessment of 
the Group’s viability over a period longer 
than the twelve months required for the 
going concern statement. In keeping with 
the assessment performed for the first time 
last year, the assessment covers a three year 
period. The Directors consider that three 
years remains an appropriate time frame for 
assessing the Group’s longer‑term viability, 
on the basis that there is a well established 
medium‑term planning process in place which 
is supported by a strategic plan covering 
key elements such as product development. 
Further, we consider that we have good 
visibility of markets during this period, albeit 
there are inherent uncertainties relating to 
Brexit which is expected to occur in March 
2019. This year’s assessment, therefore, covers 
the period from 1 April 2017 to 31 March 
2020 (the “Viability Assessment Period”). 
Key criteria applied  
in the assessment
The Directors consider that the Group’s 
viability can reasonably be assured if it is 
able to operate within parameters where net 
debt is less than three times EBITDA. In such 
circumstances, the Directors consider that 
the Group will continue to operate and meet 
its liabilities as they fall due. Of particular 
importance in the Viability Assessment 
Period, the Group’s revolving credit facility 
falls due for renewal in February 2020. The 
Directors consider that performance within the 
parameters set out above should enable the 
Group to refinance its revolving credit facilities, 
if necessary. 
Methodology and  
sensitivities applied
The viability assessment is informed by the 
principal risks and uncertainties which are 
faced by the Group and which are disclosed 
on pages 23 to 25 of this Annual Report. 
The assessment considered the potential 
financial impact if the risks identified 
were to arise and the measures available 
to the Directors to mitigate their impact. 
For 2017/18, the sensitivities were applied to 
the detailed budget for the year and for the 
two financial years ending 31 March 2019 and 
31 March 2020, the reference point was the 
medium‑term plan (“MTP”). 
The most significant risks (in terms of the 
potential financial impact in the Viability 
Assessment Period) relate to the potential 
decline in revenue and potential increases in 
input costs which would result in a decrease in 
gross profit/contribution. Reduced gross profit/
contribution are potential consequences for 
risks 1 to 7 as set out in the list of principal 
risks and uncertainties. While the impact 
of the loss of a key customer or market in 
an individual business unit might be severe 
at the business unit level, these risks at a 
Group level are mitigated by operating in 
diverse geographic markets and by not being 
overly reliant on a single customer or source 
of funding. Consequently, these risks were 
modelled in aggregate, at a Group level, 
rather than by applying sensitivities at an 
individual business unit level.
The impact of a number of the Group’s 
principal risks and uncertainties, should they 
materialise, would likely result in an increase in 
the level of non‑recurring, overhead costs. This 
is considered to be a potential consequence 
for risks 5, 8, 9, 10 and 12 as disclosed. 
The potential impact of these risks arising is 
considered in aggregate across the whole 
Viability Assessment Period by the inclusion of 
a net contingency against budgeted overhead 
costs of £11.7 million (before tax) in the first 
year of the Viability Assessment Period. For 
the purposes of the assessment, the adverse 
impact on both cash and EBITDA of this net 
contingency is assumed to arise in the first 
year of the Viability Assessment Period. 
Over the past ten years, Oxford Instruments has been 
successfully driving the adoption of nanotechnology by 
industrial and research communities all over the world.  01: Strategic Report 02: Governance 03: Financial Statements 04: Company Information
Oxford Instruments plc Report and Financial Statements 2017 27
In performing the viability assessment, the 
Directors also considered the extent to 
which other downside risks were effectively 
mitigated in the budget/MTP for the three 
year period. For example, currency exposure 
(risk 11) in the first year of the viability 
assessment is mitigated to a certain extent by 
the Group’s hedging programme. Therefore, 
the potential impact on earnings of an adverse 
exchange rate movement on un‑hedged 
foreign currency exposure was included 
against the budget baseline for the first year 
of the Viability Assessment Period. However, 
the baseline financial forecasts used in the 
two years covered by the MTP were based on 
foreign exchange rates which are considered 
to be prudent compared to current rates.
1
 
On this basis no sensitivity for adverse foreign 
exchange movements in those years was 
considered necessary. 
Based on the above, the key sensitivities 
modelled in the viability assessment relate to 
a decline in sales revenue and increases to 
cost of sales which, taken together, would 
lead to reduced gross margins/contribution. 
Over the Viability Assessment Period as a 
whole, the impact of the downside risks 
modelled resulted in a decrease to the 
baseline EBITDA of just over 40%.
Outcome
The outcome of the assessment, by 
quantifying the financial impact of downside 
risks, and taking into account mitigating 
actions available to reduce the impact of those 
risks on EBITDA and/or net debt, result in the 
Group staying within the parameters described 
above (i.e. the ratio of net debt to EBITDA is 
lower than 3:1 in each year of the Viability 
Assessment Period). 
On the basis of this assessment, which 
evaluates the potential impact of both the 
principal risks and uncertainties and the 
mitigating actions that could be taken, the 
Board has a reasonable expectation that the 
Group will be able to continue in operation 
and meet its liabilities as they fall due over the 
next three years. This is based on the explicit 
assumption, set out above, that operating 
within such parameters will enable the Group 
to obtain external funding, if required, when 
the current revolving credit facility falls due for 
renewal in February 2020. 
This assessment supports not only the viability 
statement above, but also the statement on 
going concern, set out further below.
Impact of the disposal of 
Industrial Analysis on the  
viability assessment
The viability assessment performed is based 
on the current Group structure (i.e. including 
Industrial Analysis) as the disposal is subject 
to a number of conditions precedent. 
A high‑level assessment of the impact of 
the sale of Industrial Analysis shows that 
completion of the sale would have a positive 
impact on the viability assessment. This arises 
because the reduction in net debt arising from 
the sale would outweigh the reduction in 
future EBITDA and cash flows in the model. 
Going concern statement
The Group’s business activities and factors that 
are considered likely to affect its performance 
and position in the future are set out in 
the Strategic Report on pages 1 to 27. 
The Finance Review on pages 28 to 33 
discloses information relevant to the Group’s 
financial position, its cash flows, borrowing 
facilities and liquidity. 
The Directors have considered the Group’s 
current financial position and future prospects 
and, as set out in the viability statement 
above, have performed an assessment of 
longer‑term viability up to 31 March 2020. 
On this basis, the Directors conclude that 
there is a reasonable expectation that the 
Group will continue in operational existence 
for the foreseeable future and that there 
are no material uncertainties that may cast 
significant doubt over its ability to continue 
as a going concern. 
As a result, the Directors continue to prepare 
the Financial Statements under the going 
concern basis.

The Group had a stable performance in 
2017 with total adjusted profit in line with 
expectations. Reported revenue grew by 9.0% 
to £348.5 million (2016: £319.7 million). 
Revenue, excluding currency effects, declined 
by 3.7%, with the movement in average 
currency exchange rates over the last year 
positively impacting reported revenue by 
£40.6 million. At the end of the year the 
Group’s order book for future deliveries stood 
at £144.5 million (2016: £132.2 million), 
growth of 9.3% on a reported basis and 
0.5% at constant currency. 
Adjusted operating profit from continuing 
operations increased by 3.2% to £42.5 million 
(2016: £41.2 million). Adjusted operating 
profit from continuing operations, excluding 
currency effects, declined by 5.8%. Adjusted 
operating margin from continuing operations 
declined by 70 basis points to 12.2% 
(2016: 12.9%), with a decline in Service 
margin more than offsetting an increase 
in the NanoTechnology Tools margin.
Adjusted profit before tax grew by 7.1% to 
£36.0 million (2016: £33.6 million). A pre‑tax 
adjusted profit of £1.3 million from the 
Superconducting Wire business for the seven 
months of ownership, prior to its sale in 
November 2016, is included in discontinued 
operations. For the twelve months to March 
2016 the Superconducting Wire business 
delivered an operating profit of £3.4 million. 
Including discontinued operations, the Group 
achieved reported adjusted profit before tax of 
£37.1 million (2016: £37.0 million).
Following a decline this year in financial 
performance from our US Healthcare and 
Asylum businesses, we have concluded that 
our projections of future cash flows do not 
support the level of goodwill and intangibles 
held on the balance sheet. We have also made 
a small impairment of acquired intellectual 
property in Industrial Products and written 
down inefficient capitalised development 
costs on the Group’s new ERP system. 
Consequently, goodwill and intangibles to the 
value of £37.8 million have been impaired. 
In addition, we have written down the 
carrying value of our investment in the 
ScientaOmicron joint venture by £8.0 million. 
The combined impairment of £45.8 million in 
non‑current assets is a non‑cash adjustment.
Non‑recurring items and acquisition related 
costs were £3.1 million and the movement 
in the mark‑to‑market valuation of currency 
hedges for future years gave rise to a gain of 
£1.2 million.
Adjusted profit before tax from 
continuing operations of £36.0 million 
(2016: £33.6 million) represents a margin of 
10.3% (2016: 10.5%). After the impairment 
of goodwill and intangible assets and other 
adjusting items, the Group recorded a loss 
before tax of £25.5 million from continuing 
operations (2016: profit of £9.7 million).
Finance Review
The Group had a stable performance in 2017  
with total adjusted profit in line with expectations.
Summary
• Reported revenue up 9.0%,  
down 3.7% at constant currency
• Adjusted profit before tax up 
7.1%, in line with our expectations
• Adjusted operating margin down 
70 basis points, reflecting lower 
returns in Service and higher 
returns in NanoTechnology Tools
• Dividend maintained at 13.0p  
for the full year 01: Strategic Report 02: Governance 03: Financial Statements 04: Company Information
Oxford Instruments plc Report and Financial Statements 2017 29
Continuing adjusted basic earnings 
per share grew by 5.5% to 47.8 pence 
(2016: 45.3 pence). Continuing earnings 
per share were a loss of 44.0 pence 
(2016: profit of 12.2 pence).
Operating cash flow (as defined in the cash 
flow section on page 32) decreased by 14.4% 
to £39.7 million, primarily due to a planned 
reduction in payables compared to the 
previous year end. Adjusted operating cash 
(defined as adjusted EBITDA, less movement 
in working capital, capitalised development 
expenditure and capital expenditure) 
represents 86.1% (2016: 110.4%) of adjusted 
operating profit. Net debt decreased from 
£128.2 million to £109.3 million, representing 
a net debt to EBITDA ratio (for banking 
covenant purposes) of 2.1 times, comfortably 
within our banking covenant of 3.0 times. 
During the year the Group disposed of its 
Superconducting Wire business and this has 
been treated as a discontinued operation 
in the Financial Statements. Accordingly, 
the numbers detailed in the Finance Review 
exclude the results of Superconducting Wire 
in both the current and prior periods.
Adjusted operating profit is stated before 
impairment and amortisation of goodwill 
and acquired intangibles, non‑recurring 
items and acquisition‑related costs, and 
the mark‑to‑market valuation of unexpired 
currency hedges, as set out in Note 1 to the 
Financial Statements.

Finance Review continued
Revenue
Reported revenue of £348.5 million 
(2016: £319.7 million) increased by 
9.0%. NanoTechnology Tools grew by 
11.4%, Industrial Products by 5.0% 
and Service, 6.1%.
The depreciation of Sterling against the US 
Dollar, Euro and Japanese Yen has increased 
reported revenue by £40.6 million. Revenue 
growth, excluding currency effects, showed a 
decline of 3.7%, with NanoTechnology Tools 
falling by 1.2%, Industrial Products by 7.0% 
and Service by 7.1%. 
At constant currency, revenue grew by 
7.2% in Asia, with strong growth in China. 
Revenue in Europe, North America and Rest 
of World declined by 5.9%, 12.0% and 
28.2% respectively.
The transfer of our Omicron business into 
a joint venture, ScientaOmicron, led to a 
reduction in revenue of £2.0 million compared 
to the comparative period as under equity 
accounting we no longer consolidate the joint 
venture’s revenue.
Gross profit
Adjusted gross profit grew by 16.8% to 
£181.7 million (2016: £155.5 million), 
representing an adjusted gross profit margin 
of 52.1%, an increase of 350 basis points over 
last year.
Operating profit
Adjusted operating profit increased by 
3.2% to £42.5 million (2016: £41.2 million), 
representing an adjusted operating profit 
margin of 12.2%, a decrease of 70 basis 
points against last year. The NanoTechnology 
Tools margin rose by 90 basis points to 
12.3% (2016: 11.4%) and the Industrial 
Products margin rose by 100 basis points to 
3.0% (2016: 2.0%). Lower US Healthcare 
revenue, due to a large fall in equipment 
sales, led to a fall in Service margin to 18.3% 
(2016: 24.0%). Adjusted operating profit 
includes realised losses on the maturity 
of currency hedges resulting from the 
devaluation of Sterling against the US Dollar, 
Euro and Japanese Yen since the inception of 
the hedges.
Our share of the ScientaOmicron joint venture 
showed an adjusted loss of £0.8 million in 
the period, an improvement of £1.0 million 
against the comparative period (which 
includes ten months when the joint venture 
was in operation and two months when 
Omicron was a fully owned subsidiary of the 
Group) but below the financial performance 
envisaged in the investment case. Our share 
of the ScientaOmicron joint venture 
loss was £1.4 million after our share of 
restructuring costs.
Currency effects (including the impact 
of transactional currency hedging) have 
increased reported adjusted operating profit 
by £3.7 million when compared to blended 
hedged exchange rates for the comparative 
period, blended hedged exchange rates for 
the US Dollar, Euro and Japanese Yen against 
Sterling are all at stronger rates than last year.
At constant currency the adjusted operating 
profit margin was 12.6%, a decline of 
30 basis points.
Operating profit was a loss of £20.0 million 
(2016: profit of £20.8 million), reflecting 
an impairment of non‑current assets of 
£45.8 million, amortisation of acquired 
intangibles of £13.8 million and non‑financial 
net adjusting costs of £2.9 million.
Adjusting items
Amortisation of acquired intangibles of 
£13.8 million relates to intangible assets 
identified on acquisitions, being the value 
of technology, customer relationships 
and brands.
During the year the financial performance of 
our Healthcare business in the US deteriorated 
with business operating profit falling 
significantly from last year’s level. Performance 
has been impacted by a lower level of sales of 
refurbished imaging systems compared to the 
previous year, which we expect to continue. 
This has been driven by both a particularly 
high level of activity in the prior year but also 
a change in software licensing policy by one of 
the large original equipment manufacturers. 
We have revised our financial projections for 
the business, consistent with a new strategy 
and the actions and time required to improve 
profitability and operational efficiency. 
We concluded that goodwill and acquired 
intangible assets of £11.2 million could no 
longer be supported by projected cash flows, 
resulting in an impairment of the same. 
The Group had a stable performance in 2017  
with total adjusted profit in line with expectations. 01: Strategic Report 02: Governance 03: Financial Statements 04: Company Information
Oxford Instruments plc Report and Financial Statements 2017 31
During the year the financial performance of 
our Asylum business deteriorated with the 
business performing below our expectations. 
Performance has been impacted by a 
slowdown in academic funding in US and 
European markets, resulting in a contraction 
in the overall scanning probe microscopy 
market, compounded by delays in new 
product launches. We have revised our 
financial projections for the business in light 
of the trading environment, and planned 
launch dates of new products. We concluded 
that goodwill of £22.6 million (of which 
£10.9 million was apportioned goodwill from 
the Andor acquisition) could no longer be 
supported by projected cash flows, resulting 
in an impairment of the same. 
Within our Industrial Analysis division we have 
impaired acquired intellectual property valued 
at £1.1 million that has been superseded by 
new product development. The write‑down 
of intangible assets also incorporates a 
£2.2 million charge for inefficient capitalised 
costs against the Group’s new ERP system and 
a charge of £0.7 million for the impairment of 
capitalised development costs in Asylum that 
had been made at the half year.
An impairment charge of £8.0 million 
relating to our investment in ScientaOmicron 
is a consequence of the 2016 financial 
performance and lower projected cash 
flows. This has resulted in a reassessment 
of the joint venture’s expected future 
business performance and the actions and 
time required to improve profitability and 
operational efficiency. 
Other net non‑recurring costs and acquisition 
related items during the period were 
£3.1 million. These comprise £1.5 million 
of professional fees relating to the sale of 
Superconducting Wire and the impending 
sale of Industrial Analysis and £1.6 million 
of restructuring and charges relating to the 
ScientaOmicron venture. 
The Group uses derivative products to 
hedge its exposure to fluctuations in foreign 
exchange rates. It is Group policy to have in 
place at the beginning of the financial year 
hedging instruments to cover 75% of its 
forecast transactional exposure for that year. 
The Group has decided that the additional 
costs of meeting the extensive documentation 
requirements of IAS 39 to apply hedge 
accounting to these foreign exchange 
hedges cannot be justified. Accordingly, the 
Group does not use hedge accounting for 
these derivatives.
Net movements on marking‑to‑market 
derivatives in respect of the next financial 
year are disclosed in the Income Statement as 
financial expenditure and excluded from our 
calculation of adjusted profit before tax.
The mark‑to‑market gain in respect of 
derivative financial instruments was 
£1.2 million (2016: £2.7 million loss). 
This reflects a reduction in the fair value 
liability on currency derivatives that are 
hedging future transactional currency 
exposures for the Group compared to the 
previous year end. The un‑crystallised balance 
sheet liability is attributable to a fall in the 
value of Sterling at the balance sheet date 
against the US Dollar, Euro and Japanese Yen, 
against a blended rate achieved on hedges in 
place for the 2017/18 financial year. 
Net finance costs
The Group’s adjusted net finance costs 
fell by £1.1 million to £6.5 million 
(2016: £7.6 million) with finance charges 
falling by £0.3 million to £5.6 million, pension 
financing charges falling by £0.6 million 
to £1.1 million and financial income rising 
to £0.2 million.
Total net finance charges were £5.5 million 
reflecting the unwind of discount in respect of 
contingent consideration and mark‑to‑market 
movements in respect of derivative 
financial instruments.
Profit before tax
Continuing adjusted profit before tax 
increased by 7.1% to £36.0 million 
(2016: £33.6 million). The continuing adjusted 
profit before tax margin decreased by 20 basis 
points to 10.3% (2016: 10.5%).
A loss before tax of £25.5 million  
(2016: profit of £9.7 million) is after the 
impairment of goodwill and acquired 
intangibles and other adjusting items.
Tax
The adjusted tax charge of £8.7 million 
(2016: £7.7 million) represents an effective tax 
rate of 24.1% (2016: 22.9%). The increase 
is primarily due to a reduction in deferred tax 
assets (excluding deferred tax on adjusted 
items) recognised in the US and an increase 
in specific tax provisions.
The statutory effective tax rate is 1.5%, 
lower than would be expected due to some 
impairment charges not deductible for 
tax purposes. 
Earnings per share
Continuing adjusted basic earnings per share 
and adjusted diluted earnings per share, 
before adjusting items, both increased 
by 5.5% to 47.8 pence and 47.7 pence 
respectively. Continuing basic and diluted 
earnings per share both decreased to a loss 
of 44.0 pence. 
Undiluted weighted average shares have 
stayed flat at 57.1 million.
Foreign exchange
The Group faces transactional and 
translational currency exposure, most notably 
against the US Dollar, Euro and Japanese 
Yen. For the full year, approximately 12% 
of Group revenue was denominated in 
Sterling, 54% in US Dollars, 19% in Euros, 
10% in Japanese Yen and 5% in other 
currencies. Translational exposures arise on the 
consolidation of overseas company results into 
Sterling. Transactional exposures arise where 
the currency of sale or purchase transactions 
differs from the functional currency in which 
each company prepares its local accounts.
The Group maintains a hedging programme 
against its net transactional exposure using 
internal projections of expected currency 
trading transactions expected to arise over 
a period extending from 12 to 24 months. 
As at 31 March 2017 the Group had currency 
hedges in place extending up to twelve 
months forward.
Dividend
The Group’s policy is to increase the dividend 
each year in line with the increase in 
underlying earnings. However, taking into 
account the impact on the Group of business 
disposals, currency effects and our progressive 
strengthening of the balance sheet, the Board 
has proposed to hold the dividend at last 
year’s level. This results in a final dividend of 
9.3 pence, bringing the total dividend for 
the year to 13.0 pence. The final dividend 
will be paid, subject to Shareholder approval, 
on 19 October 2017 to Shareholders on the 
register as at 22 September 2017. 32 Oxford Instruments plc Report and Financial Statements 2017

Cash flow
The Group cash flow is summarised below. Adjusted operating cash flow excludes rental assets held for resale and profits or losses on disposal of 
fixed assets, both of which are included within expenditure on tangible and intangible fixed assets.

Note: Adjusted EBITDA is earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, intangible amortisation, mark‑to‑market of financial derivatives and other non‑cash adjusting items.
Adjusted operating cash flow
Adjusted operating cash flow in the year 
decreased by 14.4% to £39.7 million 
(2016: £46.4 million). Adjusted operating cash 
(defined as adjusted EBITDA, less movement 
in working capital, capitalised development 
expenditure and capital expenditure) 
represents 86.1% (2016: 110.4%) of adjusted 
operating profit due to an outflow of working 
capital over the period.
The working capital outflow of £4.4 million 
reflects an increase in inventories of 
£1.5 million, a decrease in receivables of 
£0.6 million and a decrease in payables 
of £3.5 million. The increase in inventories 
primarily reflects a build up of refurbished 
imaging system inventory prior to sale or 
rental. We have experienced a planned 
reduction in payables as we move to a 
smoother phasing of payments compared 
to the previous year end. 
Interest
Net interest paid was £5.0 million 
(2016: £5.6 million). The difference from last 
year is primarily due to lower financing costs 
arising from a lower level of average net debt 
compared to the comparative period.
Tax
Tax paid was £2.1 million (2016: £3.5 million), 
the reduction reflecting utilisation of brought 
forward tax losses in Germany and the UK. 
Losses in Germany arose from the Omicron 
business while losses in the UK related to 
restructuring costs and the roll‑forward of 
R&D credits.
Investment in research and development (“R&D”)
Total cash spend on R&D in the year was £30.3 million, equivalent to 8.7% of sales, (2016: £28.3 million, 8.9% of sales).  
A reconciliation between the amounts charged to the Income Statement and the cash spent is given below:

Acquisitions and disposals
In the first half of the year acquisition payments comprised US$ 10.1 million (£6.5 million) for the final deferred consideration on Medical Imaging 
Resources, Inc (“MIR”) and £0.3 million attributable to the purchase of Asylum Research Corporation (“Asylum”). In the second half of the year 
£3.0 million was paid for deferred consideration on an inherited Andor earn‑out. 
The Superconducting Wire business was sold on 17 November 2016 for US$17.5 million (£14.2 million). Cash proceeds of £12.2 million reflect 
deferred consideration and cash transferred on disposal.
Net debt and funding
Net debt
Net debt decreased in the period from £128.2 million to £109.3 million. Operating cash flow was £39.7 million. Expenditure of £9.8 million 
relates to deferred consideration payable for MIR, Asylum and financial commitments made by Andor prior to acquisition. Disposal proceeds of 
£12.2 million relate to the sale of Superconducting Wire. The Group invested in tangible and intangible assets of £4.1 million and capitalised 
development costs of £7.9 million.

Funding
The Group has in place an unsecured 
multi‑currency revolving facility agreement 
which is committed until February 2020. 
The facility has been entered into with 
a group of three banks and comprises a 
Sterling denominated multi‑currency facility 
of £100 million and a US Dollar denominated 
multi‑currency facility of $37.0 million. 
The Group has also issued a bilateral 
private placement note of £44.5 million, 
which matures in 2021 and a £25.0 million 
amortising fixed rate loan from the European 
Investment Bank that matures in 2020. In 
addition, the Group has uncommitted facilities 
of £20.0 million.
Debt covenants are net debt to EBITDA less 
than 3.0 times and EBITDA to interest greater 
than 4.0 times. As at 31 March 2017 net 
debt to EBITDA was at 2.1 times and EBITDA 
to interest was 9.5 times, both comfortably 
within our banking covenants.
Pensions
The Group has defined benefit pension 
schemes in the UK and USA. Both have been 
closed to new entrants since 2001 and closed 
to future accrual from July 2010.
At 31 March 2017, the net liability arising 
from our defined benefit scheme obligations 
was £25.1 million (2016: £35.0 million), a fall 
of £9.9 million. 
The reduction in the deficit was due to a 
fall in the discount rate which was offset 
by a reduction in inflation and mortality 
projections rates combined with deficit 
recovery contributions. Total scheme assets 
at 31 March 2017 were £287.9 million 
(2016: £239.5 million) while liabilities were 
£313.0 million (2016: £274.5 million).
The annual deficit recovery payment to the 
UK scheme was £6.9 million for the financial 
year, payable through to and including 2021. 
For the years up to and including 2018, the 
payment will rise by the higher of inflation and 
growth in dividend per share; thereafter, the 
payment will increase in line with inflation. 
Going concern
The Group’s business activities, together 
with the factors likely to affect its future 
development, performance and position, 
are set out in the Performance, Strategy and 
Operations sections. The financial position of 
the Group, its cash flows, liquidity position 
and borrowing facilities are described in the 
Finance Review.
The diverse nature of the Group, combined 
with its financial strength, provides a solid 
foundation for a sustainable business. 
The Directors have reviewed the Group’s 
forecasts and flexed them to incorporate a 
number of potential scenarios relating to 
changes in trading performance. 
The Directors believe that the Group will 
be able to operate within its existing debt 
facilities. This review also considered hedging 
arrangements in place. The Directors believe 
that the Group is well placed to manage its 
business risks successfully.
The Financial Statements have been prepared 
on a going concern basis, based on the 
Directors’ opinion, after making reasonable 
enquires, that the Group has adequate 
resources to continue in operational existence 
for the foreseeable future.

Corporate responsibility enables us to adapt to the changing landscapes we operate within and to 
engage with local communities whilst being mindful of the needs of our customers, employees and 
investors. By supporting these needs and being aware of our environmental impact we are able to 
ensure that we continue to operate in a socially responsible manner.
The key areas in which we  
focus our efforts are: 
• brand and employee engagement; 
• diversity and inclusion; 
• health and safety and 
environmental monitoring; and
• business ethics, including human 
rights and business malpractice. 
Oxford Instruments is committed to 
the following guiding principles of 
corporate responsibility:
• establishing and maintaining 
long‑term, effective stakeholder 
relationships;
• offering our people an excellent 
employment experience;
• strengthening our business through 
diversity and inclusion; and
• operating in an ethical, 
sustainable and environmentally 
responsible manner.
Our stakeholders
Investors
We continue to ensure our investors receive 
regular and transparent communications 
from Oxford Instruments. In their first year, 
the Chief Executive and the Group Finance 
Director have met a number of investors and 
analysts. In November we hosted over 30 fund 
managers at our Tubney Woods site, providing 
them with an overview of the Group and a 
number of demonstrations from our Industrial 
Analysis and NanoScience businesses. We also 
held a site visit for Aviva at our High Wycombe 
site earlier this year. 
We continue to make a recording of our 
results presentations available on our 
website. This year we added the ability 
to watch our results presentation live 
via a webcast. This allowed our analysts, 
investors and employees even greater ease 
of access to this presentation. The investor 
pages on the Oxford Instruments website 
continue to provide links to investor‑related 
materials and to our businesses.

Corporate Responsibility continued
Customers
We have a wide and diverse range of 
customers across many different industries. 
It is important that we continue to deliver 
customer satisfaction and to keep on top of 
this we measure our net promoter score to 
see how our customers feel we are doing. 
The net promoter system asked our customers 
whether they would recommend Oxford 
Instruments plc to others. This year we have 
received our highest score for several years.
We continue to build on this in our new 
Horizon strategy by ensuring that our 
customers are the central focus of all we do. 
By developing a better understanding of our 
customers’ needs, and, by building deeper 
relationships, gaining insights into their 
behaviours, we will be able to anticipate the 
next set of challenges they may face. This 
will allow us to create the solutions that our 
customers will need in the future.
We look to build on our wide range of 
communication channels, taking advantage 
of the increasing popularity of social media, 
to build two‑way communications. Through 
Horizon, we will offer more personalised 
and relevant messaging for our customers 
to ensure they are kept aware of all we offer 
that is relevant to them. 
Employees
At Oxford Instruments, our employees are 
fundamental to our business success. We 
continually invest in our people, developing 
the capabilities that we will need to succeed 
over the longer term. We are committed to 
being the Company where the best in our 
sector want to work. We strive to offer the 
opportunities that will attract, motivate and 
retain talented employees, enabling them to 
give their best.
Our people vision is to be proud to be 
recognised as the leaders in what we do and 
for the difference we make in the world. 
Our aim is to retain, attract and enable the 
best people to perform, creating an inclusive 
environment and culture, where difference is 
valued and people are recognised for what 
they deliver and bring to the team.
To improve the quality, speed and predictability 
of our people‑related decisions, we are 
investing in a leading cloud‑based Human 
Resources Information System. This will 
provide significant advantages in terms of how 
we operate across the business and provide 
an opportunity to standardise, simplify and 
automate many of our key people‑related 
processes. The system will provide managers 
with key metrics and employees will be able 
to carry out personal transactions, which will 
deliver efficiencies across the business. 
Developing capability 
To ensure we can deliver our long‑term 
growth plans, each business has undertaken 
a capability review. This has allowed them to 
develop a strategically aligned capability plan, 
which will ensure that we have the resources 
required to grow the businesses over the 
longer term. 
A key element of developing capability is 
our ability to identify key talent. To support 
this, our talent management activities are 
moving into a new phase. We are focusing on 
ensuring that those within our Group that are 
ready to take on a more complex or higher 
level role have the opportunities and support 
to reach their potential. We also continue 
to make strides in relation to strengthening 
our succession planning through identifying 
credible successors for each of our key 
leadership and technical expert positions. 
Our Talent Framework outlines the behaviours 
and skills that employees should have to 
be successful at Oxford Instruments. We 
use this insight to develop our Oxford 
Instruments Academy portfolio to offer a 
range of relevant training courses, providing 
our employees with programmes that can 
help build their capability and careers. 
Our flagship Management Development 
Programme (“MDP”) covers many of the skills 
needed to be a successful manager in Oxford 
Instruments. We see the positive impact that 
the MDP has on our employees, with 99% of 
participants recommending it to a colleague 
and 97% reporting a positive impact on 
their performance. 
We are focused on building our communication approaches 
to ensure that all employees across the Group understand 
our strategy and how the business is performing.
Management Development Programme (“MDP”)
Since June 2014, nine new MDP cohorts have run, including one in Japan.  
16% of participants have been promoted after completing the programme.

To further support our technologists and 
engineers to deliver innovative products and 
solutions that continually meet and exceed our 
customers’ expectations, we have introduced 
a Technical Development Programme. 
This programme integrates with our technical 
career ladder, offering technical employees 
a clear career path within Oxford Instruments, 
without the need to take on people 
management roles. This enables us to attract 
and retain the best engineers and scientists.
We offer Industrial Post Doctoral placements 
to high‑calibre researchers providing them the 
opportunity to experience a role in industry. 
In many cases these individuals have decided 
to join us on a permanent basis, helping to 
ensure that our technical skill base remains 
at the cutting edge. 
Our Early Career Programme continues 
to introduce high potential candidates to 
the business. We have adjusted the hiring 
cycle to better align with the academic 
cycle to support our aim of attracting the 
best candidates. 
Diversity and inclusion
Our objective is to ensure that we have a high 
capability, diverse workforce that enables us to 
better understand our customers and markets; 
with a broad range of perspectives and 
experiences that maximise our capability to 
innovate, make the right decisions and exceed 
our customers’ expectations. In order to retain, 
attract and enable the best people to perform, 
we need to create an inclusive environment 
and culture, where difference is valued and 
people are recognised for what they bring to 
the team and what they deliver. 
To support this, we are enhancing our focus 
on the social environment and culture that 
we create globally. Selection, promotion and 
succession planning processes ensure that we 
recruit, train and promote the best candidates 
based on suitability for the role. Our managers 
receive unconscious bias training through our 
MDP . In addition we have enhanced our leave 
and flexible working schemes to attract and 
retain a diverse workforce.
We continue to work towards an environment 
where the gender balance of our managers 
also reflects the Company’s gender 
balance globally. 
Reward and recognition
This year we have aligned our reward schemes 
with our Horizon strategy to provide clarity 
and focus on performance expectations. 
We have streamlined and simplified our core 
annual performance bonus schemes and 
launched a new Growth Incentive Plan so 
that all employees can take part in a scheme 
that rewards performance against targets and 
goals within their business.
We continue to look at ways to enhance the 
benefits we offer our employees. We provide 
our Extra intranet site to offer benefits such 
as discounts on local activities, merchandise, 
insurance, dental cover, a key focus being our 
employee wellbeing. We provide Employee 
Assistance Programmes, which provides a 
host of counselling, coaching and digital 
resources. Communication of the benefit 
programmes is also a key focus and includes 
total reward statements, benefit road shows 
and interactive sessions.
Communication
We are focused on building our communication 
approaches to ensure that all employees 
across the Group understand our strategy and 
how the business is performing. We make 
extensive use of the intranet and recordings 
of key presentations which are made available 
across the Company. 
Many of our businesses hold “Espresso” 
meetings, short informal presentations over 
coffee or lunch, where topics of interest can 
be discussed. Examples of these presentations 
include a focus on new products and 
understanding our strategy. 
Suppliers and partners
The Group recognises that relationships 
built on trust and respect with our business 
partners establish mutually beneficial relations. 
This includes our suppliers, banks and 
collaborative associates. We have now started 
the initial roll out of our new ERP system, 
which will offer a more efficient means to 
manage our supplier relationships, including 
how we purchase materials and serve our 
customers. 
We perform regular inspections and audits and 
strategic reviews are in place for key suppliers. 
In accordance with ISO 9001 and ISO 14001, 
only quality approved organisations are 
used. There is a Group supplier management 
process in place that promotes a common 
supply chain strategy split by commodity, 
driving the business towards fewer, high level, 
quality suppliers.

Corporate Responsibility continued
Local communities
We want to help make our local communities 
better places to work and live in. We recognise 
the impact we have socially and economically 
and aim to support those around us in a 
number of ways. We encourage our sites to 
support their communities through charity and 
community activities. This year we have raised 
money for a range of charities and staff have 
engaged in a range of fundraising activities, 
including football matches between sites, 
bake‑offs and quiz nights.
It is also vitally important to us that we play 
a role in encouraging the next generation 
of scientists and engineers. Many of our 
businesses continue to work with local 
schools and colleges to help introduce 
science and engineering to a new audience. 
We offer work experience to school leavers 
interested in careers in a Company like 
Oxford Instruments and continue to offer 
both summer and gap‑year placements 
to promising University students. 
We also work with several Universities in 
the UK, USA, Asia and Europe, sponsoring 
technology prizes and getting involved in 
career events to open up the opportunities 
available in a technology Company for Science 
and Engineering graduates and postgraduates. 
Ethics
We have a Code of Business Conduct 
and Ethics that supports our commitment 
to operate appropriately and ethically. 
All employees are made aware of this Code 
and have full access to it. We endeavour to 
build a culture of trust and inclusiveness, and 
expect any person or company who represents 
us or provides services for us, to act in a 
way that is consistent with our Code and its 
principles. We perform regular due diligence 
on our agents, distributors and suppliers to 
minimise the risk of any unethical behaviour. 
Suppliers are required to prove they do not 
employ workers under the age of 15 or, in 
those countries subject to the developing 
country exception of the ILO Convention 138, 
employ no children under the age of 14.
We take a risk‑based approach to define 
our anti‑bribery and corruption policies and 
procedures. All employees are required to 
complete our anti‑bribery and corruption 
training, with additional refresher training at 
appropriate intervals. We do not tolerate any 
form of bribery, corruption or fraud. 
The Board regularly reviews and updates 
the range of policies in place to support 
our Code of Conduct. Clear guidelines exist 
regarding the reporting and management 
of any perceived risk and all employees are 
made aware of and regularly reminded about 
Safecall, a fully independent, confidential 
service, where they can report any 
wrongdoing in the business. 
Oxford Instruments does not make 
political donations.
Many of our businesses continue to work with local schools 
and colleges to help introduce science and engineering to a 
new audience.

Oxford Instruments plc Report and Financial Statements 2017 39
We are a Company united by strong standards and values; 
our employees have the right to expect that their basic 
human rights and dignity are respected.
Human rights
We continue to review our policies and 
systems supporting human rights. Our policy 
is guided by the United Nations Guiding 
Principles on Business and Human Rights. 
Our Human Rights Policy states our intent to 
be inclusive, supportive and safe, covering 
matters including forced labour, child labour, 
discrimination and the right to form or join a 
trade union and to bargain collectively.
We expect every employee to adhere to the 
spirit of our policy and it is fully supported 
by our Board. All members of the Group’s 
Executive Committee take responsibility for 
ensuring its implementation within their part 
of the Group. We also extend our expectations 
on human rights to those we work with; our 
partners, contractors and suppliers. 
We are committed to preventing acts of 
modern slavery and human trafficking from 
occurring within our business and supply 
chain and put in place effective systems and 
controls in order to do so. We have reviewed, 
and improved, our supplier due diligence and 
audit procedures. We have a zero‑tolerance 
approach to all forms of modern slavery, 
including servitude, forced, bonded and 
compulsory labour and human trafficking 
and we expect our suppliers to adopt the 
same approach.
Health and safety
The number of accidents has reduced by  
23% compared to the previous year. 
Health and Safety within Oxford Instruments 
is managed at the Executive level by Charles 
Holroyd, Group Business Development 
Director, who is assisted by Dave Wales, 
the Group Health, Safety and Environment 
Manager. Each Group site has a nominated 
Health, Safety and Environment manager or 
representative responsible for ensuring that 
day‑to‑day activities are carried out safely. 
All of our large sites are audited annually by 
the Group Health, Safety and Environment 
auditing team, comprising auditors from our 
four UK businesses. 
Three of our largest sites are certified to 
ISO 14001, ISO 9001 and OHSAS 18001 
management system standards. These sites 
are subjected to twice‑yearly external auditing 
from their nominated certification body. 
Global accident figures  
remain at a low level 
The total number of accidents recorded 
worldwide during 2016/17 showed a 
significant fall to 57 compared with 74 in 
the previous year. The substantial reduction 
in accidents over the previous five years has 
been broadly maintained. This demonstrates 
our commitment to the Health and Safety 
of our staff, which we take very seriously 
and work hard together as a team to effect 
improvements. Our sites are operating in as 
safe a manner as possible with the majority 
of accidents recorded being very minor cuts 
and bruises. 
The number of accidents per employee 
dropped to 0.030 in 2016/17 from  
0.037 in 2015/16. 
Globally, three reportable accidents occurred 
during the year, an increase from two in 
the previous year. For reporting purposes, 
global reportable accidents were normalised 
using the UK definition of over seven days’ 
absence from work.
We continue to focus on making our sites 
safer places to work. The six year picture 
in the graph below shows a continuing 
positive trend.

has an Energy Champion at a local level who 
is responsible for monitoring energy use, 
waste streams, recycling and emissions to 
air, water and land. They also continuously 
look for innovative ways to reduce energy 
consumption.
We monitor our global energy use. During 
the 2016 calendar year, we saw a significant 
reduction in the Group Carbon Footprint to 
9,604 tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent 
(“tCO
2
e”) from 11,666 tCO
2
e in 2015. This 
was due to several factors, including a general 
improvement in energy efficiency, and the 
disposal of our Superconducting Wire business 
in November. This business consumed more 
energy than our other manufacturing sites. 
We also strive to minimise our waste 
outputs and ensure that as little as possible 
goes to landfill. Several of our sites are 
now “zero waste to landfill” where waste 
is recycled either directly e.g. cardboard, 
metals, wood, paper and food, or indirectly 
for non‑recyclable general waste that is 
sent to waste sites where it can be used to 
produce energy.
Oxford Instruments consumed 16.73GWh of 
energy globally in 2016/17. The Company’s 
measure of energy efficiency was 
45.15MWh/£million revenue compared 
to 58.75 MWh/£million revenue in the 
previous year. 
Oxford Instruments is a full participant in the 
UK Carbon Reduction Commitment Energy 
Efficiency Scheme (“CRC”). The Company 
purchases carbon allowances to cover its 
emissions from energy generation and 
burning gas for heating and hot water. 
For the 2016/17 year, 3,681 carbon 
allowances were required to meet UK 
carbon emissions.

These were purchased in advance and will 
be surrendered in September. Due to lower 
consumption, only 3,000 carbon allowances 
will be purchased in the current year to cover 
carbon emissions. 
Oxford Instruments measures the energy 
equivalent of employee air travel for its UK 
and USA operations. Air travel for the 2016/17 
financial year totalled 14.85 million kilometres, 
a 12.5% reduction on the previous year. This 
equated to a carbon footprint of 2,229 tCO
2
e 
based on 80% long haul and 20% short 
haul flights, as detailed in the chart opposite.
In accordance with our Energy and 
Environmental Policies the Group is 
committed to improving our energy efficiency. 
We continue to invest in energy‑reducing 
technologies at our sites, such as LED lighting. 
The Group complies with all environmental 
legislation in countries where it operates. 
This includes European Directives such as the 
Waste Electronic and Electrical Equipment 
(“WEEE”) Directive, the Restriction on use of 
Hazardous Substances (“RoHS”) regulations 
and the Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation 
of Chemicals (“REACh”) Directive. From 
July 2017 all products that are sold into 
Europe will comply with the RoHS regulations. 
As part of the UK Companies Act 2006 
(Strategic Report and Directors’ reports) 
Regulations 2013, Oxford Instruments has 
a mandatory duty to report greenhouse 
gas emissions as tonnes of carbon dioxide 
equivalent (“tCO
2
e”). The Group’s measure 
of carbon emissions is tonnes of carbon 
dioxide equivalent per £million of revenue. 
This year the global carbon emissions figure 
is 18.17 tCO

(“GHG”) emissions 
Oxford Instruments is a global business with 
operations in many parts of the world. It 
has been monitoring energy use and carbon 
emissions since 2008. Emissions from 17 
company sites are monitored and are reported 
as below. Some small sales offices where 
energy consumption is less than 0.01% of the 
Group’s total energy consumption are omitted. 
The amount of recorded hydro-fluorocarbons 
is below 5kg globally and has therefore not 
been included in the figures.
Intensity ratio
The Company’s declared intensity ratio for 
Greenhouse Gas Reporting is tonnes of 
CO

With revenues for the year at £348.5 million 
and the total emissions of carbon dioxide 
equivalent of 6334 tonnes, this gives an 
intensity ratio as follows:

Corporate Governance
The Board is committed to conducting 
business responsibly and maintaining high 
standards of corporate governance. 
Dear Shareholders
I am pleased to introduce the Group’s 
corporate governance report on behalf  
of the Board. The corporate governance 
statement provides an insight into how the 
Board operated during the year. The Board is 
committed to conducting business responsibly 
and maintaining high standards of corporate 
governance. This will, when underpinned by 
our business strategy, enhance performance 
and grow the business of Oxford Instruments. 
The approach to governance is set by the 
Board and the Management Board ensures 
that the approach is effectively implemented 
across Oxford Instruments’ businesses around 
the world. 
The main Group‑wide governance documents 
are the Oxford Instruments Code of 
Business Conduct and Ethics together with 
the policies which sit within our statement 
on Corporate and Social Responsibility. 
These can be found on our website at  
www.oxford-instruments.com/investors/
corporate-and-social-responsibility
These policies and statements set out the 
values and standards that we expect our 
employees to meet. These documents, 
together with our policies, govern how we 
conduct our business and set the standards 
that drive performance. Compliance training 
and, in some areas, standard procedures, 
help to enforce this. Board oversight, reviews 
and audits form part of the monitoring 
and supervision process. Risk processes are 
embedded and reviewed on an ongoing basis 
across the organisation. 
The last few years’ succession planning 
for both Executive and Non‑Executive 
Directors has seen considerable change in 
the constitution of our Board over the past 
year. We have welcomed a new executive 
team with Ian Barkshire, Chief Executive, 
and Gavin Hill, Group Finance Director. 
I was brought in to succeed Nigel Keen as 
Chairman in September 2016. At our AGM in 
September, we also said goodbye to two of 
our Non‑Executive Directors, Jock Lennox and 
Jennifer Allerton. 
During the latter half of the year, we started a 
search for a Non‑Executive Director with skills 
to complement those already on the Board. 
On 13 June 2017 we announced that Stephen 
Blair, until recently Chief Executive of e2v, 
will be joining the Board. Our Board is now 
in good shape to guide Oxford Instruments 
through its next phase of development.
I encourage all Shareholders to attend 
the AGM which will be held at the 
Company’s Head Office in Tubney Woods, 
Oxfordshire, on Tuesday 12 September 
2017. This event provides an opportunity 
for Shareholders to meet the Executive and 
Non‑Executive Directors.

Compliance
The Board endorses the main and supporting 
principles and the provisions set out in the 
2014 UK Corporate Governance Code 
(“the Governance Code”) and considers 
that, throughout the period under review, 
the Group has complied with the provisions 
recommended in the Governance Code 
save for provision A.4.1. The Board did not 
designate a Non‑Executive Director as Senior 
Independent Director after Jock Lennox stood 
down from the Board after the AGM on 
13 September 2016. Instead, the Chairman, 
Alan Thomson, who was appointed on 
12 September 2016, undertook a review 
of the Board and commenced a search 
for a new Non‑Executive Director. This has 
culminated with the appointment of Stephen 
Blair to the Board on 1 July 2017 as an 
Independent Non‑Executive Director and he 
has been designated as Senior Independent 
Director. The 2016 UK Corporate Governance 
Code was issued in April 2016 and applies 
to accounting periods beginning after 
16 June 2016.
Taken together with the reports of the 
Nomination Committee, Audit and Risk 
Committee, the report on remuneration 
and the report on corporate responsibility, 
this Statement explains how Oxford 
Instruments has applied the principles of 
good corporate governance as set out in the 
Governance Code.
Resolutions for the election of all Directors 
will be put to Shareholders at the Company’s 
forthcoming AGM. Once passed, this will 
continue to deliver a Board which meets 
the requirements of Provision B.1.2 of the 
Governance Code.
Preservation of value
The basis on which the Group generates and 
preserves value over the longer term and the 
strategy for delivering the objectives of the 
Group are to be found in the Strategic Report.
Board of Directors and 
management structure
Board of Directors
The Board as at the date of this Report 
comprises the Chairman, three Non‑Executive 
Directors (rising to four with effect from 
1 July 2017) and two Executive Directors. 
The Directors’ biographies and details of 
length of service are shown on pages 42 and 
43. All the Directors have written letters of 
appointment that have been approved by the 
Board and which are available for inspection 
at the Company’s Annual General Meeting. 
The Chairman is responsible for leadership 
of the Board and ensuring its effectiveness 
on all aspects of its role. The division of 
responsibilities between the role of Chairman 
and the Chief Executive has been set out in 
writing and agreed by the Board.
The Board is responsible to Shareholders 
for good corporate governance, 
setting the Group’s strategic objectives, 
values and standards, and ensuring the 
necessary resources are in place to achieve 
the objectives. 
The Board has delegated Group responsibility 
for the management of health, safety and the 
environment to Ian Barkshire and he reports to 
the Board on these matters at each meeting.

Management Board
The Board delegates management of the 
business to the Chief Executive. To assist 
in this, the Chief Executive has created a 
Management Board that consists of the 
Executive Directors, senior managers with 
Group‑wide functional responsibilities and 
the heads of the principal businesses of the 
Group’s activities. 
The Management Board meets monthly either 
physically or by video or telephone conference 
and focuses on Group‑wide performance, 
strategy and risk management.
Operation of the Board
The Board is responsible to Shareholders 
for delivering sustainable incremental 
Shareholder value through entrepreneurial 
leadership within a framework of controls 
for managing risk. The Board sets the Group’s 
strategy, maintains the policy and decision 
making framework in which this strategy 
is implemented, verifies that the necessary 
financial and human resources are in place 
to meet strategic aims, monitors performance 
against key financial and non‑financial 
indicators, oversees the system of risk 
management and sets values and standards 
in governance matters.
The details of the way the Board operates, 
including a schedule of matters reserved to 
the Board for decision, are set out in the 
Board Reference File. The Board’s policies 
and procedures are documented in the 
Board Reference File, which sets out the 
roles and delegated authorities applying 
to the Directors, the Board and the Board 
Committees. The Board Reference File is 
reviewed annually by the Board as part of 
the annual governance review undertaken 
by the Chairman. 
The Board retains control over strategy, 
investments and capital expenditure, and 
limits the decisions which can be taken by 
management in the areas of strategic and 
financial management and shareholder 
reporting. The Board also decides on the 
Group’s capital structure, corporate actions, 
mergers and acquisitions, major contracts and 
other commitments, litigation and regulatory 
proceedings, remuneration and share 
incentive plans.
Where the Board delegates authority to 
management it is on a structured basis, which 
requires that proper management oversight 
exists at the appropriate level.
The Board meets on a regular basis, at least 
seven times a year, and otherwise as required. 
Board meetings are held at a number of 
Group locations during the year. The Board 
also held one meeting specifically to discuss 
the Company’s strategic direction during 
the year. 46 Oxford Instruments plc Report and Financial Statements 2017
Corporate Governance continued
Board meetings involve reviews of financial 
and business performance against the plan 
approved by the Board. Risk management 
review, both at Group level and also for each 
of the business units, is embedded in the 
reporting system. On a rotating basis, the 
Board receives presentations from the business 
units and key functional areas enabling it 
to explore specific issues in more detail. 
Any matter requiring a decision by the Board 
will be supported by a pre‑circulated paper 
analysing all relevant aspects of the proposal 
and recommending a course of action.
Board papers are distributed in advance of the 
relevant meeting in sufficient time to allow 
the Directors to prepare for meetings. Minutes 
of Committee meetings are circulated to the 
relevant Directors. In the very few instances 
when a Director has not been able to attend 
Board or Committee meetings, his/her 
comments on the papers to be considered at 
the meeting are communicated in advance to 
the relevant Chairman.
The Non‑Executive Directors meet without 
the Executive Directors at least annually, 
with the Chairman leading these meetings. 
The Non‑Executive Directors also meet 
annually without the Chairman in attendance. 
The Senior Independent Director chairs these 
meetings. During the year, whilst a new Senior 
Independent Director was being recruited, 
Richard Friend chaired this meeting.
The Company Secretary and the Company 
Secretary’s office are responsible for 
implementing Board procedures and 
for advising the Board on corporate 
governance matters.
Board balance and independence
The Governance Code requires the Board 
should be of sufficient size that the balance 
of skills and experience is appropriate for the 
requirements of the business and that there 
is a balance of Executive and Non‑Executive 
Directors such that no individual or small 
group of individuals can dominate the 
Board’s decision making. The composition 
of the Board and the combination of 
diverse backgrounds and expertise of the 
Non‑Executive Directors meet these principles.
Alan Thomson, Chairman, was appointed to 
the Board as an Independent Non‑Executive 
Director on 1 June 2016 and appointed 
Chairman on 13 September 2016. He has a 
Masters degree from Glasgow University and 
is a Member and past President of the Institute 
of Chartered Accountants of Scotland. He is 
Chairman of Hays pc and Bodycote plc. 
On 30 March 2017 Bodycote announced that 
Alan will be retiring from his role of Chairman 
but that he will stay on until a successor 
is found. Previously, he was Chairman of 
Polypipe Group plc and a Non‑Executive 
Director of Laporte Plc, Alstom SA and of 
Johnson Matthey Plc. Earlier in his career, 
he worked on a variety of audits for Arthur 
Andersen and Price Waterhouse, followed by 
senior management positions with Rockwell 
International plc, Raychem Ltd and Courtaulds 
plc and was Group Finance Director of Rugby 
Group plc and then Smiths Group plc.
Alan is Chairman of the Nomination 
Committee and a member of the 
Remuneration Committee. 
Richard Friend was appointed to the Board 
as an Independent Non‑Executive Director 
on 1 September 2014. Richard is a Fellow 
of the Royal Society and Fellow of the Royal 
Academy of Engineering. He is also Cavendish 
Professor of Physics and a Fellow of St. John’s 
College at the University of Cambridge. 
His research encompasses the physics, 
materials science and engineering of 
semiconductor devices made with 
carbon‑based semiconductors. His research 
advances have shown that these materials 
have significant applications in LEDs, solar 
cells, lasers and electronics. He was knighted 
for services to physics in the Queen’s Birthday 
Honours List in 2003. He has also been 
directly involved in the commercialisation 
of technology through several spin‑out 
companies from the University of Cambridge. 
Richard is a member of the Audit and Risk, 
Remuneration and Nomination Committees. 
Thomas Geitner was appointed to the Board 
as an Independent Non‑Executive Director 
on 15 January 2013. He is a graduate of the 
Technische Universität München and holds an 
INSEAD MBA. 
Thomas has extensive international experience in 
the technology and engineering sectors, having 
spent more than 30 years in businesses operating 
across the globe. Having worked in a number of 
global companies he understands the importance 
of remuneration connecting with strategy to 
appropriately incentivise the executive team.
The Board believes that his skills, experience 
and knowledge make Thomas well suited to 
chair the Remuneration Committee. Thomas 
is also a member of the Audit and Risk and 
Nomination Committees. 
Mary Waldner was appointed to the Board 
as an Independent Non‑Executive Director 
on 4 February 2016. She is now Chief 
Financial Officer at Lloyd’s Register and was 
Group Finance Director of Ultra Electronics 
plc until April 2016. She has a masters 
degree in physics from Oxford University 
and is a Fellow of the Chartered Institute of 
Management Accountants. 
Mary has a broad range of experience in 
high technology companies that operate 
internationally and has worked in a number of 
senior financial roles with major public limited 
companies, including Group Finance Director 
of Ultra Electronics plc until April 2016.
The Board believes that Mary’s background 
gives her the various insights needed to 
make her a well qualified Chairman of the 
Audit and Risk Committee. Mary is also 
Chairman of the Audit and Risk Committee 
and a member of the Remuneration and 
Nomination Committees.
Following the year end and date of this report, 
it has been announced that Stephen Blair 
will be joining the Board as an Independent 
Non‑Executive Director, with effect from 
1 July 2017. He will also be designated as  
Senior Independent Director from the same date. 
Stephen was Chief Executive of Teledyne e2v 
Limited (previously e2v technologies plc), a 
manufacturer of sensors, radio frequency 
generators and semiconductors and a 
listed company until its recent acquisition 
by Teledyne Technologies in March 2017. 
Previously he was Business Group Director 
for Spectris plc. He has broad operational 
experience and a breadth of experience 
covering established and high growth 
emerging markets, strategic planning and 
portfolio development.  01: Strategic Report 02: Governance 03: Financial Statements 04: Company Information

Independence of  
Non-Executive Directors
In the opinion of the Board, Alan Thomson, 
Mary Waldner, Thomas Geitner and Richard 
Friend are independent. Stephen Blair was 
considered independent on appointment.
The Board considers that they are each 
independent in character and judgement and 
do not have relationships which are likely to 
affect their judgement. This opinion is based 
on current participation and performance 
on both the Board and Board Committees 
including consideration of the length of 
service at Oxford Instruments plc and for 
Stephen Blair was demonstrated through the 
recruitment process.
Term of appointment of 
Non‑Executive Directors
Each Non‑Executive Director was appointed 
for an initial term of three years. In line 
with provision B.7.1 of the Governance 
Code, the Board has determined that all 
Directors of the Board are to be subject 
to annual re‑election by Shareholders and 
accordingly the appropriate resolutions will 
be put to Shareholders at the Company’s 
forthcoming AGM.

Board development  
and evaluation
Board development
On appointment, Directors undertake an 
induction process which is designed to 
develop knowledge and understanding of 
the Group’s businesses through visits to 
various Group operating sites, discussion 
of relevant technology, as well as product 
demonstrations, briefings from management 
and familiarisation with investor perceptions 
of the Group. This induction is supported 
by briefing papers prepared by the 
Company Secretary. 
The operating business units’ senior 
management teams and functional leaders 
present to the Board on a regular basis. 
Non‑Executive Directors are encouraged 
to meet individual members of the senior 
management team and have done so during 
the year under review.
Throughout the year, Non‑Executive Directors 
attend Oxford Instruments’ events, exhibitions 
and award presentations.
The Company Secretary and her office act as 
advisers to the Board on matters concerning 
governance and ensure compliance with Board 
procedures. All Directors have access to this 
advice and a procedure also exists for Directors 
to take independent professional advice at the 
Group’s expense. No such advice was sought 
during the year. The appointment and removal 
of the Company Secretary are matters for the 
Board as a whole.
Board evaluation
In light of the provisions of Section B.6.2 of 
the Governance Code which expects that an 
externally facilitated evaluation of the Board 
be carried out at least triennially, in 2014/15 
Colin Mayer, the Peter Moores Professor of 
Management Studies at Said Business School, 
University of Oxford, and a Board Member of 
the European Corporate Governance Institute, 
carried out a thorough review of the way the 
Board operates. Professor Mayer determined 
that Oxford Instruments is well governed, 
well run and a successful company which 
comfortably fulfils the requirements of the 
Governance Code in terms of the structure 
and conduct of its governance. He considered 
the formal governance and procedures in 
Oxford Instruments are significantly better 
than in most companies of a similar size. 
Professor Mayer suggested a number of areas 
in which the Company’s governance could 
be strengthened with a view to promoting its 
development from a successful medium sized 
firm to a truly global company of international 
significance. 
This year, the Board carried out its annual 
effectiveness evaluation exercise, including 
a specific review of the effectiveness of its 
principal Committees and members. This 
was an internal exercise under the control of 
the Chairman using a detailed questionnaire 
completed by all Directors in relation to the 
key areas of Board accountability and the 
arrangements in place to enable effective 
focus on these areas. Topics covered included 
Group strategy, performance, delegation and 
accountability, success, development and 
reward, Board and Committee composition, 
Board induction and training, internal 
control and risk management. At the 
individual one‑to‑one interviews which the 
Chairman holds with each Director, individual 
performance and the operation of the Board 
and its Committees have been discussed 
in more detail. The Chief Executive is also 
involved in the process by giving his input 
on the way the Board helps him in his role. 
Each Committee Chairman also reviewed 
the effectiveness of his/her committee in a 
similar way. The output from these evaluations 
allows the Chairman to review objectively the 
overall balance and effectiveness of the Board. 
The Non‑Executive Directors met during the 
year, chaired by Richard Friend, and appraised 
the Chairman’s performance.
The Board evaluation covered the activities 
of the Board and each of its Committees. 
The Board and its Committees are considered 
to be working well. Arising from the 
exercise it was concluded that the Board is 
working well together and providing good 
challenge and support to the Executive. 
The overall conclusion is that the Board and 
its Committees are performing well and have 
good governance standards.  48 Oxford Instruments plc Report and Financial Statements 2017

Board committees
The Board has formed the following 
Committees: Audit and Risk, Nomination, 
Remuneration and Administration.
Membership of Board Committees, which is 
set out on pages 42 and 43, is determined 
by the Board and is reviewed regularly. 
The written terms of reference of the Board 
Committees are reviewed annually by each 
Committee and the Board and are  
available on the Company’s website at  
www.oxford-instruments.com/investors 
and from the Company on request. They will 
be on display at the Annual General Meeting.
Detail on the operation of each of the Audit 
and Risk, Remuneration and Nomination 
Committees is to be found within the relevant 
Committees’ reports. 
Nomination Committee
The Nomination Committee comprises all 
the Non‑Executive Directors, under the 
chairmanship of the Chairman of the Board. 
The Nomination Committee is responsible 
for assisting the Board in the formal selection 
and appointment of Directors and considers 
succession planning for the Board. The 
Nomination Committee reviews succession 
plans annually. 
Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee comprises all 
the Independent Non‑Executive Directors and 
the Chairman of the Board. Thomas Geitner 
is the Chairman of the Committee. The Board 
considers that Thomas, with his experience of 
working at senior levels in global companies, 
including high technology companies, has 
an appropriate blend of skills to make a 
successful Chairman of the Remuneration 
Committee. The members of the Committee 
are appointed by the Board.
The Remuneration Committee is responsible 
for recommending to the Board the 
remuneration packages for Executive Directors 
and the bonus and share option strategy for 
the Group’s executive management. 
Independent professional advice is sought 
when considered necessary. The Chairman 
and the Executive Directors are responsible for 
fixing the remuneration of the Non‑Executive 
Directors and the Remuneration Committee 
is responsible for fixing the remuneration of 
the Chairman. No Director is involved in the 
process that sets his/her own remuneration.
The Chief Executive is invited to attend 
all or part of Remuneration Committee 
meetings as deemed appropriate, for example 
when consideration is being given to the 
performance of other Executive Directors and 
on significant Group‑wide changes in salary 
structure and terms and conditions affecting 
other employees at senior executive level. 
Audit and Risk Committee
The Audit and Risk Committee comprises 
all the Independent Non‑Executive Directors 
and its Chairman is Mary Waldner. Mary 
took over from Jock Lennox as Chairman 
of the Committee on 16 June 2016. Other 
members of the Board, senior management 
and the external auditor are invited to attend 
all or part of any meetings. The Board has 
determined that Mary, with her background in 
financial management, will be the designated 
financial expert from 16 June 2016 and that 
Jock Lennox, as a Chartered Accountant and 
former Senior Audit Partner at EY, was the 
designated financial expert until 16 June 2016.
The Audit and Risk Committee’s main 
responsibilities are focused on financial 
reporting, external audit, internal audit, 
internal controls and risk management. 
Full details of the operation and the work of 
the Audit and Risk Committee are included in 
the Audit and Risk Committee Report set out 
on pages 51 to 57.
Administration Committee
The Administration Committee consists of 
a minimum of two Directors and deals with 
items of a routine and administrative nature. 
At each of its meetings, the Board receives a 
summary outlining all matters decided by the 
Administration Committee since the previous 
Board Meeting. 01: Strategic Report 02: Governance 03: Financial Statements 04: Company Information
49 Oxford Instruments plc Report and Financial Statements 2017
Annual General Meeting (“AGM”)
The AGM is an opportunity for the Board 
to meet Shareholders. At its AGM, the 
Group complies with the provisions of the 
Governance Code relating to the disclosure 
of proxy votes, the separation of resolutions 
and the attendance of Committee Chairmen. 
The Group arranges for the Annual Reports 
and Financial Statements and related papers 
to be posted on its website and, where 
Shareholders have elected to receive paper 
copies, posted to Shareholders so as to allow 
at least 20 working days for consideration 
prior to the AGM. The next AGM will be held 
on 12 September 2017 at the Group’s offices 
in Tubney Woods, Oxfordshire.
Investor relations
The Group places considerable importance on 
regular communications with its Shareholders, 
with whom it has an ongoing programme of 
dialogue. All Shareholders are encouraged to 
participate in the AGM at which the Chairman 
and Chief Executive present an overview of 
the Group’s business, review the results and 
make comments on strategy and current 
business activity.
The Non‑Executive Directors meet informally 
with Shareholders both before and after the 
AGM and respond to Shareholder queries 
and requests. The Chairman and the Senior 
Independent Director make themselves 
available to meet Shareholders as required.
All Group announcements are posted  
on the Group website,  
www.oxford-instruments.com/investors, 
as soon as they are released. The Investor 
Relations section of the website provides 
financial and other information on the Group 
and the website itself carries additional 
information on the Group’s products, services 
and markets.
Risk management
Within the Group there is an ongoing 
embedded process for identifying, evaluating 
and managing the significant risks faced by 
the Group. Day‑to‑day management of this 
process has been delegated by the Board to 
the Executive Directors. Detail of the process 
is set out in the Audit and Risk Committee 
Report on pages 51 to 57. This process has 
been in place for the year under review and 
up to the date of approval of the Annual 
Report and Financial Statements. It is 
regularly reviewed by the Board of Directors 
and accords with the principles of the 
Governance Code.
The Board has carried out a robust assessment 
of the principal risks facing the Group, 
including those which threaten its business 
model, future performance, solvency and 
liquidity. Details of all major risks identified, 
and the mitigating actions in place, are 
reported to and reviewed by the Board  
and/or Audit and Risk Committee. The 
Principal Risks (pages 23 to 25) gives an 
overview of the major risks and uncertainties 
faced by the Group. A standard process is 
in place throughout the Group that requires 
the senior management of each business 
to identify significant business risks and 
to classify them both as to probability and 
potential impact. Once identified, mitigating 
action, where possible, is formulated and 
responsibility within the management team 
assigned. On a regular basis each business 
reviews and updates its risk summary which 
is then reported to the Chief Executive. If a 
material risk changes or arises, the Managing 
Director of the business reports this in writing 
to the Chief Executive at which time there is a 
discussion on the adequacy of the mitigating 
actions taken. 
In addition, the Board and the Audit and 
Risk Committee consider risks to the Group’s 
strategic objectives which are not addressed 
within the Group’s businesses and develops 
appropriate actions to manage and mitigate 
these risks.
Internal audit and assurance
The Group’s internal audit function has 
responsibility for independently assessing 
the adequacy and effectiveness of the 
management of significant risk areas and 
provides an oversight view of operational 
management’s front line and assurance 
activities. Further details of the internal audit 
activities are set out in the Audit and Risk 
Committee Report on pages 51 to 57.
Internal control
The Board has accountability for reviewing 
and approving the adequacy and effectiveness 
of internal controls operated by the 
Group, including financial, operational and 
compliance controls and risk management. 
The management of each business is 
responsible for risk management and control 
within their business and, through the 
Management Board, implementing Board 
policies on risk and control. 
The internal control framework includes 
central direction, oversight and risk 
management of the key activities within the 
Group. As part of this framework there is a 
financial planning process which includes a 
three year planning model and the preparation 
of an annual budget approved by the Board. 
The results of the business units are reported 
monthly and compared with the budget. 
Forecasts are also prepared monthly. 
Control activities include policies and practices 
covering appropriate authorisation and 
approval of transactions, the application of 
financial reporting standards and reviews 
of significant judgements and financial 
performance. Financial, regulatory and 
operational controls, procedures and risk 
activities across the Group are reviewed by 
the Group’s assurance function. 
The internal control framework has been 
designed to manage rather than eliminate 
material risks to the achievement of strategic 
and business objectives and can provide only 
reasonable, and not absolute, assurance 
against material misstatement or loss. Because 
of inherent limitations, internal controls over 
financial reporting may not prevent or detect 
all misstatements. There has been no material 
change to the Group’s internal control 
framework during the period covered by this 
Report and Financial Statements.  50 Oxford Instruments plc Report and Financial Statements 2017
Corporate Governance continued
Internal control continued
The key components designed to provide 
effective internal control within the Group are 
as follows:
• there is a formal schedule of matters 
reserved to the Board for decision; other 
than these matters, the Board delegates 
to the Chief Executive and reviews the 
delegation of authorities throughout the 
management structure;
• the Group’s management structure 
is headed up by the Management 
Board. Its membership comprises the 
Executive Directors, senior managers with 
Group‑wide functional responsibilities 
and the heads of the principal businesses 
of the Group’s activities. Day‑to‑day 
responsibility for the management of the 
Group is delegated to the Management 
Board. The responsibility is based on 
the identification of separate businesses 
for each of the Group’s activities for 
which there are clearly defined lines of 
management responsibilities at all levels 
up to and including the Group Board and 
the Group’s accounting and reporting 
functions reflect this organisation;
• financial executives within Group 
businesses report to their own operational 
head but there is also a well established 
and acknowledged functional reporting 
relationship through to the Group 
Finance Director;
• the Board reviews strategic issues and 
options formally once a year during the 
annual strategic planning process and 
during the year as appropriate. In addition 
the Executive Directors maintain a three 
year planning model of the Group and its 
individual businesses;
• annual budgets are prepared for each 
of the Group’s businesses which include 
monthly figures for turnover, profit, capital 
expenditure, cash flow and borrowings. 
The budgets are reviewed through the 
Group management structure and result 
in a Group financial budget which is 
considered and approved by the Board;
• the businesses prepare monthly 
management accounts which compare 
the actual operating result with both the 
budget and the prior year. The businesses 
also prepare rolling reforecasts for orders, 
turnover, operating profit and cash. Both 
are reviewed by the Board at each of its 
scheduled meetings;
• the Board approves all acquisition and 
divestment proposals and there are 
established procedures for the planning, 
approval and monitoring of capital 
expenditure;
• for all major investments the performance 
of at least the first twelve months against 
the original proposal is reviewed by 
the Board;
• each Group site, except for representative 
sales offices, is required to submit 
a self‑assessment internal control 
questionnaire annually;
• internal audit is carried out through a 
system of regular reviews of the financial 
and non‑financial internal controls at each 
site and this is further reported on in the 
Audit and Risk Committee Report on pages 
51 to 57. These reviews are coordinated 
by the Group Internal Audit and Risk 
Manager;
• the Board receives regular updates on 
pensions, corporate social responsibility, 
business ethics and health and safety and 
the Audit and Risk Committee regular 
updates on treasury, tax, insurance 
and litigation;
• authorisation limits are set at appropriate 
levels throughout the Group; compliance 
with these limits is monitored by the Group 
Finance Director and the Group Internal 
Audit and Risk Manager;
• all requests to quote for substantial fixed 
price contracts are reviewed by the Chief 
Executive and/or the Group Finance 
Director to assess both technical and 
financial risk and to fix an appropriate 
balance between risk and reward. 
However, no procedure can guarantee the 
avoidance of losses on fixed price contracts 
of a technical nature; and
• with respect to the UK pension scheme, 
the Group nominates half of the trustee 
directors of the corporate trustee to the 
pension scheme, involves as necessary 
its own independent actuary with whom 
actuarial assumptions are reviewed, 
agrees the investment policy with the 
trustee, works with the trustee on its 
investment sub‑committee to deal with 
day‑to‑day investment matters and to act 
as a co‑ordinator between the investment 
advisers, investment managers and the 
trustee, ensures there is an independent 
actuarial valuation every three years and 
agrees funding levels to provide adequate 
funding to meet the benefit payments of 
the members as they fall due.

Audit and Risk Committee Report
I am pleased to present the Audit and Risk 
Committee report having taken over as 
Chairman of the Committee in June 2016. 
Mary Waldner
Audit and Risk Committee Chairman
Dear Shareholder, 
As part of my handover from my predecessor, 
Jock Lennox, we discussed key areas of historical 
importance and potential areas of risk which 
may require scrutiny in the future. I would like 
to take the opportunity to thank Jock for his 
assistance in this transition in particular and 
also, more broadly, for the work he performed 
during his tenure as Chairman of this Committee.
The role of the Audit and Risk Committee 
has remained broadly stable during the year, 
against a period of change in the Group’s 
leadership. The appointments of Ian Barkshire 
as CEO and Gavin Hill as Group Finance 
Director have brought a new executive team 
to the Board. Ian brings 20 years of experience 
within Oxford Instruments, most recently as 
the sector head of Nano Characterisation 
and Gavin comes with valuable external 
perspective, as the former Group Financial 
Director of Synergy Health plc. Further, in 
2016/17 Alan Thomson was appointed as 
Chairman of the Board. 
The Committee has the responsibility for 
assurance over financial controls as well as 
over other functions of key importance to 
the Group such as New Product Innovation, 
Information Technology and Security, 
Health Safety and Environment and HR. The 
Committee is also responsible for reviewing 
the effectiveness of internal audit, oversees 
the relationship with the external auditor 
(including the Group’s policy on the 
provision of non‑audit services) and monitors 
the integrity of the Financial Statements, 
including the application of significant 
financial judgements. 
During the year the Committee continued to 
evolve its focus to reflect the risk environment. 
The Audit and Risk Committee and the new 
Group Finance Director agreed to focus the 
internal audit function on the fundamentals 
of the financial control environment, in order 
to gain assurance over the effective operation 
of key financial controls. In addition, the 
audit programme has maintained a risk based 
element and has also delivered ad hoc work, 
to address specific risks, mandated by the 
Group Finance Director. This approach will 
continue in 2017/18. 
Key areas of activity for the Audit and 
Risk Committee in the last twelve months 
have included: 
• a review of the Group Risk Register at each 
meeting of the Committee;
• a detailed review of specific subjects on 
the Group Risk Register (e.g. IT and cyber 
security) and of certain business units’ 
principal risks;
• a review of treasury and tax matters;
• a half‑yearly review of significant litigation;
• a review of the Group’s Viability Statement 
including the methodology used in the 
forecasts and key assumptions on which 
it is based; 
• a review of the key financial risks such as 
adverse movements in foreign exchange 
and the pension deficit, together with key 
mitigating strategies (e.g. hedging policy);
• a review of the effectiveness of internal audit;
• an assessment of the effectiveness of the 
external audit process; 
• a review of the statement issued at the 
Annual General Meeting; and
• a bi‑annual review of the Financial 
Statements and the significant accounting 
judgements used in their compilation. 
(The significant accounting judgements 
relating to the 2017 Financial Statements 
are set out on page 54.)
The rest of this report sets out the 
composition of the Audit and Risk Committee; 
summarises its role and responsibilities; 
provides a summary of key activities it has 
undertaken over the course of the year and 
the Committee’s view of significant matters 
related to the Financial Statements. It also 
explains how the Committee has fulfilled its 
responsibilities in each area of its remit. 
I will be at the AGM in September. In the 
meantime, if you have any questions or 
comments I should be delighted to hear 
from you. 
Mary Waldner
Audit and Risk Committee Chairman
13 June 2017 52 Oxford Instruments plc Report and Financial Statements 2017
Audit and Risk Committee Report continued
Composition 
The members of the Audit and Risk 
Committee are Mary Waldner, Sir Richard 
Friend and Thomas Geitner. Mary was 
appointed as Chairman on 16 June 2016. 
Jock Lennox and Jennifer Allerton retired from 
the Committee in September 2016 when they 
stepped down from the Board. 
In keeping with the FRC’s Guidance on 
Audit Committees, the Audit and Risk 
Committee’s terms of reference require that 
at least one member of the Committee has 
recent and relevant financial experience. 
Mary Waldner is the current Chief Financial 
Officer of Lloyd’s Register and has previously 
held senior financial roles at a number of 
quoted companies including, most recently, 
Ultra Electronics plc. On this basis, the Board 
considers that Mary fulfils the requirement to 
have recent and relevant financial experience 
and is also independent. Both Professor Sir 
Richard Friend and Thomas Geitner bring 
relevant sector experience to the Committee. 
The Committee invites participation from 
non‑members at its meetings as required. 
This may include auditors (external and 
internal); members of the Board; and subject 
matter experts (e.g. the Chief Information 
Officer). The Committee has the opportunity 
to speak with the external auditor without 
the presence of the executive management 
at each meeting attended by the external 
auditor. The Company Secretary acts as 
secretary to the Committee.
Role and responsibilities
The Committee’s key duties are  
summarised below and are detailed in 
full in the terms of reference, a copy of 
which can be found on our website at  
www.oxford-instruments.com/investors. 
The main responsibilities of the Committee 
are focused on the following areas:
Financial reporting 
• Reviewing and challenging significant 
financial reporting judgements and 
accounting policies and compliance with 
accounting standards.
• Monitoring the integrity of the 
Financial Statements and associated 
announcements. 
• Advising the Board on whether the 
Annual Report and Financial Statements, 
taken as a whole, are fair, balanced and 
understandable and whether all material 
matters such as contingent liabilities have 
been considered in their preparation.
• Monitoring compliance with relevant 
statutory and listing requirements.
External audit
• Oversight of the external audit relationship.
• Holding regular meetings with the external 
auditor, including meetings without 
executive directors, including meetings 
for audit planning and reporting.
• Reviewing and approving the annual audit 
plan and audit findings
• Responsible for evaluating the effectiveness 
of the external audit process and assessing 
the external auditor’s independence 
and objectivity.
• Providing recommendations to the Board 
for the appointment or re‑appointment of 
the external auditor.
• Reviewing and monitoring the non‑audit 
services policy and the level of non‑audit 
services provided.
Effectiveness of the internal  
control environment
• The Audit and Risk Committee considered 
information from a number of sources to 
evaluate the effectiveness of the internal 
control environment. This included, 
inter alia, reports from both internal and 
external audit. Further, on the basis of 
those reports, the Committee assessed 
whether internal audit activities were 
appropriately directed to provide the 
required level of assurance. The Committee 
concluded that the cyclical programme 
of internal financial audits provided an 
effective mechanism to assess internal 
controls and, based on the reports 
received, controls were generally found 
to be operating effectively.
• Following discussions with the CEO 
and the Group Finance Director, it was 
agreed that the delegation of authorities 
would be updated in order to implement 
a number of changes arising from the 
revised risk appetite of the Board and to 
ensure that revised limits were effectively 
communicated throughout the Group. 
The revised delegation of authorities was 
finalised and distributed in September 
2016. Specific tests of adherence are 
included in the internal audit programme 
for 2017/18.
Internal audit and risk management
• Annual consideration of the resources 
required for an effective internal audit 
and risk management function.
• Approval of internal audit’s annual 
audit programme.
• Reviewing the Group’s internal control 
and risk management systems.
• Regular review of the Group’s key risks 
(both inherent risks and emerging 
risks) and associated monitoring 
process, together with a regular review 
of the output from the Group’s risk 
management processes.
Business malpractice 
• Reviewing the adequacy and security of 
the Group’s whistle‑blowing arrangements 
and the provision of proportionate and 
independent investigation of any matters 
raised through those channels.
• Reviewing the Group’s procedures for 
detecting fraud and its processes and 
controls to prevent bribery.
Reporting 
• Compilation of a report on its activities, 
in accordance with the UK Corporate 
Governance Code.
• Reporting to the Board on any matter it 
considers requires action or improvement.
• Advising the Board on Directors’ 
responsibilities relating to the 
Financial Statements.
The Committee periodically reviews its 
terms of reference and its effectiveness 
and recommends to the Board any changes 
required as a result of such review.  01: Strategic Report 02: Governance 03: Financial Statements 04: Company Information

Activities of the Audit and Risk Committee in respect of the financial year ended 31 March 2017
The Committee has worked largely to a recurring and structured programme of activities developed from its terms of reference and designed to 
fulfil its responsibilities throughout the financial year. A summary of the items discussed in each meeting is set out in the table below:

Annual review of treasury arrangements       • 
Annual review of tax        • 
The Committee’s remit extends beyond financial risk and considers assurance activities in relation to a number of key, non‑financial areas. These 
include New Product Innovation (“NPI”), a core area in the Group’s strategy for success, and key enabling functions such as HR (with a particular 
focus on succession management and potential challenges arising from Brexit) and IT. The Committee has renewed its focus on data/cyber security 
and breach response as its evaluation of external threats in this domain continues to rise. The Committee also receives reports on the operational 
audit programme and health and safety, and environmental performance and compliance. The Committee considers these areas provide 
proportionate coverage and assurance over the most significant areas of potential risk faced by the Group. 
In accordance with the 2014 UK Corporate Governance Code, the Board requested that the Committee advise it on whether the Annual Report, 
taken as a whole, is fair, balanced and understandable and provides the information necessary for Shareholders to assess the Group’s position and 
performance, business model and strategy. This work formed part of the review of the draft Financial Statements that was undertaken in May and 
June 2017. 54 Oxford Instruments plc Report and Financial Statements 2017
Audit and Risk Committee Report continued
Significant matters related  
to the Financial Statements
The Committee reviews all significant issues 
concerning the Financial Statements. The 
principal areas of significant accounting 
judgement considered in relation to the 2017 
Financial Statements were:
Disposal of OST Wire  
and Industrial Analysis
Following its disposal in November 2016, 
the OST Wire business has been treated as 
a discontinued operation. As a result, the 
after‑tax profit of the OST Wire operation has 
been presented as a single line item at the 
foot of the Income Statement.
This treatment is considered to be correct 
because, inter alia, the OST Wire was a 
significant component of the Group; was 
disclosed as an operating segment to the 
Board; had its own management team; 
had a distinct customer base and business 
model; and was a separate calculation 
component within the model which creates 
the segmental analysis included within the 
Financial Statements.
With regard to the disposal of Industrial 
Analysis, the Committee takes the view that 
as at 31 March 2017, the transaction was not 
highly probable. At that time, a number of 
significant commercial issues relating to the 
disposal were outstanding; there was still a 
possibility of a material reduction in Hitachi’s 
offer (which may have made it unattractive to 
the Board); and the transaction had not been 
approved by the Board of either company.
Accordingly, the Industrial Analysis business 
has not been treated as a held for sale asset as 
at 31 March 2017 and its results are included 
within continuing operations for the year.
Carrying Value of Acquired 
Intangible Assets (including 
Capitalised Goodwill)
Intangible assets total £181.0 million (Note 17) 
of which acquired intangible assets amount 
to £160.7 million. This comprises capitalised 
goodwill of £84.5 million and other intangible 
assets from acquisitions of £76.2 million. 
The most significant elements of acquired 
intangibles relate to Andor at £118.4 million 
(of which £61.4 million relates to goodwill). 
As set out in Note 17 to the Financial 
Statements, the carrying value of goodwill 
for each investment has been assessed 
for impairment. 
Impairment charges were recognised in the 
year against the carrying value of goodwill in 
both the Asylum and OI Healthcare businesses 
amounting to £28.8 million with a further 
£5.0 million of impairments against other 
intangibles in these two business units. 
This arose from a detailed review of the future 
performance expected from these business 
units and as a result, management considered 
it was no longer appropriate to retain any 
goodwill balance against those acquisitions. 
The Committee has received detailed 
explanations and supporting information 
relating to both the impairment charges 
recognised and the current carrying value of 
intangible assets. The Committee is satisfied 
with the methodology used in assessing the 
position at 31 March 2017. 
Valuation of investment  
in associate undertaking
Following the disposal of the Omicron 
businesses in May 2015 to Scienta Scientific 
AB, the Group has held a 47% shareholding 
in the resultant business combination. 
The Group has a minority shareholding and 
appoints two out of five directors to Scienta 
Scientific AB’s board. On this basis, the 
Committee is satisfied with management’s 
assessment that the Group does not control 
Scienta Scientific AB. Accordingly it has been 
treated in the Group Financial Statements as 
an investment in an associate.
The investment in Scienta Scientific AB is 
accounted for under the equity method of 
accounting and is assessed for impairment. 
As set out at Note 7 to the Financial 
Statements, management performed a review 
of the carrying value of this investment and 
determined that an impairment of £8.0 million 
was required to reduce the value of its equity 
investment to £3.8 million. The Audit and 
Risk Committee has reviewed a detailed paper 
on this impairment and is satisfied that it has 
been performed appropriately. 
Provisions for product warranty  
and related matters
The Group faces an inherent risk of 
potential claims in relation to product 
quality or intellectual property infringement. 
Management has presented its analysis of 
potential exposure to these risks and the Audit 
and Risk Committee has also discussed the 
level of provisions recognised in the Financial 
Statements with KPMG. Given the inherent 
uncertainty in such matters it is likely that 
the actual settlement cost arising from any 
potential claim would vary from the amounts 
provided. The methodology to estimate 
potential exposure in this area has been 
calculated in a manner consistent with the 
prior year. 
UK defined benefit scheme
IFRS requires the Group to value its pension 
deficit at the difference between the net 
present value of the scheme liabilities and 
the assets of the scheme as at the balance 
sheet date. The reported deficit has reduced 
by £9.5 million to £21.5 million as at 
31 March 2017.
IFRS requires the Group to appoint an 
external actuary to give advice as to suitable 
assumptions and to calculate the value of 
the liabilities at the balance sheet date. 
The Group has appointed Aon Hewitt, 
the pension scheme‘s actuary, to perform 
bi‑annual valuations on its behalf for 
accounting purposes. 01: Strategic Report 02: Governance 03: Financial Statements 04: Company Information
55 Oxford Instruments plc Report and Financial Statements 2017
AON Hewitt recommended suitable 
assumptions which were, except as noted 
below, in line with previous years. These 
recommendations were accepted by 
management and form the basis of the 
updated valuation.
The valuation of the scheme assets was 
provided by PSolve (the scheme’s investment 
manager) in accordance with market practice 
for valuing investment assets.
In calculating the deficit AON Hewitt used 
member data from the March 2015 triennial 
valuation prepared for the scheme’s Trustees.
In respect of the calculation of the discount 
rate, the actuary has refined the methodology 
so as to exclude debt issued by universities 
from the group of borrowers used to establish 
an AA rated bond yield. The Group considers 
this more accurately reflects the financing 
cost of companies which are similar to Oxford 
Instruments. This change was first adopted at 
the half year. This change in methodology has 
the impact of reducing the reported deficit by 
£6.5 million compared to the previous basis.
Further, the actuary used the latest mortality 
tables which give lower life expectancies than 
those used in the past. The impact of this 
revision was to reduce the reported deficit 
at 31 March 2017 by £5.6 million.
Tax provisions
The Group has a number of tax positions 
where the outcome is uncertain and ultimately 
depends on the view taken by tax authorities, 
both in the UK and overseas. The net tax 
liability reported in the Financial Statements is 
effectively reduced as a result of tax efficient 
activities including claims for technology 
related tax reliefs, benefits from a tax efficient 
financing structure, and deferred tax assets 
(e.g. timing differences and carried forward 
losses). In preparing the provisions, judgement 
has been exercised by management with the 
aim of recording assets and liabilities at the 
fair value of the most likely outcome. The 
Committee is satisfied that judgement has 
been applied consistently with prior years.
Adjusted profit and EPS
As explained in Note 1 to the Financial 
Statements, the Group applies adjustments 
to the statutory definition of profit and EPS 
to present adjusted profitability and earnings 
as the Board believes they present a clearer 
picture of the financial performance of the 
Group. In the year ended 31 March 2017, 
adjustments before taxation totalled 
£61.5 million of which £48.7 million relate to 
the amortisation and impairment of acquired 
intangible assets. A further £8.0 million 
relates to the impairment charge against 
the investment in the Scienta Omicron joint 
venture and impairments against other 
intangible assets amounted to £2.9 million. 
Other adjustments arose from non‑recurring 
and acquisition and disposal related activities 
(together a charge of £3.1 million) and 
a mark‑to‑market gain of £1.2 million 
on derivative financial instruments. The 
Committee has received a detailed analysis 
from management to demonstrate that the 
Group’s definitions have been consistently 
applied. These items involve careful judgement 
and the Committee is satisfied that they have 
been rigorously considered by management 
and appropriately disclosed.
Misstatements
Management reported to the Committee 
that they were not aware of any material 
misstatements or immaterial misstatements 
made intentionally to achieve a particular 
presentation. The auditor reported a 
schedule of unadjusted audit differences to 
the Committee. Following discussion with 
management and the auditor, the Committee 
were satisfied that the adjustments were 
not material to the Financial Statements 
and therefore remained unadjusted. 
The Committee concluded that it was satisfied 
that the auditor had fulfilled its responsibilities 
with diligence and professional scepticism.
After reviewing the presentations and reports 
from management, and after consulting, 
where necessary, with the external auditor the 
Committee was satisfied that the Financial 
Statements appropriately addressed the critical 
judgements and key estimates (both in respect 
to the amounts reported and the disclosures). 
The Committee was also satisfied that the 
significant assumptions used for determining 
the value of assets and liabilities, including the 
pension commitments of the Group, had been 
appropriately scrutinised and challenged.
External auditor
The Committee monitors the performance, 
objectivity and independence of the external 
auditor. It also recommends the appointment 
of the external auditor to the Board and is 
responsible for approval of its fees. 
At the Audit and Risk Committee meeting in 
January 2017, KPMG, the external auditor, 
set out its plan for undertaking the external 
audit. KPMG’s audit planning memorandum 
set out its proposed audit methodology, 
scope and draft materiality for its audit of 
the Financial Statements for the year ended 
31 March 2017. It was compiled following 
meetings with, inter alia, the Group Finance 
Director, Chairman of the Board and Chairman 
of the Audit and Risk Committee. Further, 
it covered KPMG’s assessment of key areas 
of audit risk and its planned approach for 
addressing them. After due consideration, the 
Committee approved KPMG’s audit strategy 
and planning memorandum. 
The Committee assesses the effectiveness 
of the audit process through the reporting 
received from KPMG at the half year 
and year end and through feedback 
from key stakeholders at all levels across 
Oxford Instruments. Its assessment of the 
effectiveness of the process for the year ended 
31 March 2017 will take place in July 2017.
KPMG was reappointed as auditor following 
a tender process in 2014. Under the rules for 
audit tendering and rotation implemented 
in June 2016, the Group shall be required 
to replace KPMG as auditor by no later 
than 31 March 2021. In the meantime, the 
Committee shall monitor the reappointment 
of KPMG on an annual basis and will arrange 
for a tender process when it considers it is 
appropriate to do so. 56 Oxford Instruments plc Report and Financial Statements 2017
Audit and Risk Committee Report continued
Auditor independence 
In its assessment of the independence of the 
auditor the Committee receives confirmation 
of any relationships between the Group 
and KPMG that may have a bearing on its 
independence and receives confirmation that 
it is independent of the Group.
To further safeguard the objectivity and 
independence of the external auditor and to 
mitigate the risk of the external auditor firm’s 
independence becoming compromised, the 
Committee has a formal policy governing 
the engagement of the external auditor 
to provide non‑audit services. In light of 
changes to the Corporate Governance Code 
that took effect in June 2016, all non‑audit 
related engagements over £50,000 require 
formal advance approval by the Committee. 
The details of the audit fees for the year, 
together with fees for non‑audit services, are 
set out in Note 4 (page 100) to the Financial 
Statements. In the year ended 31 March 2017, 
audit fees paid to KPMG were £421,000 and 
non‑audit fees were £142,000. This represents 
a non‑audit to audit fee ratio of 0.34:1.
Internal audit
The Audit and Risk Committee seeks 
assurance over the effective design and 
operation of internal controls from the internal 
audit function. This is delivered through the 
annual internal audit programme which 
includes a core focus on internal financial 
controls. These financial controls audits are 
performed at business units on a rotational 
basis and are complemented by a number 
of risk based audit topics which are typically 
performed across all operational business 
units. The internal audit methodology for 
financial audits was updated in the first half 
of 2016/17 and delivery of the updated 
programme commenced in the second half 
of the financial year. 
In the course of the second half of 2016/17, 
the revised internal financial audit programme 
was delivered at three operational business 
units (NanoAnalysis, NanoScience and Plasma 
Technology) and at the German Federal Office. 
The internal audit plan for 2017/18 includes 
coverage of five further operational business 
units and two Federal Offices.
The current internal audit strategy is to focus 
on the fundamentals of financial controls 
and governance, to establish whether there 
is an effective control environment at a 
business unit level and to identify potential 
opportunities for improvement. In addition to 
the audits performed at business units, the 
audit programme will be delivered across the 
principal Federal Offices. 
The internal audit plan for 2017/18 was 
approved by the Audit and Risk Committee in 
January 2017. It considered whether the scope 
of the plan was sufficient to address the key 
requirements of the audit strategy. Factors that 
were considered included the levels of risk, 
other assurance activities and findings from 
previous audits (both internal and external). 
The Chairman of the Audit and Risk 
Committee and the Group Internal Audit and 
Risk Manager have regular meetings during 
the year. The latter has a direct reporting 
line to the Chairman of the Audit and Risk 
Committee and also meets regularly with the 
external auditor, independently from senior 
management, to discuss areas of potential 
risk and audit focus. All financial internal 
audit reports are provided to the Audit and 
Risk Committee and the external auditor on a 
timely basis once finalised, in addition to the 
relevant business unit/Federal Office and the 
Group Finance Director. 
The Committee monitors the resources and 
scope of work of the Group internal audit 
function to ensure that its activities are 
directed to the most appropriate areas, taking 
into account the requirements of corporate 
governance and specific risks identified from 
the risk management process. 
Internal control and  
risk management
The maintenance of effective internal 
controls and risk management systems are 
critical to mitigating the risks faced by the 
Group. As both the Group and the external 
environment change, we are required to 
respond and consider whether existing 
mechanisms are sufficient to provide the 
assurance required. During the year, the 
Audit and Risk Committee has evaluated 
the effectiveness of internal audit and the 
mechanisms used for risk management. 
The Board has also considered its approach 
to risk, setting its risk appetite and the means 
used to cascade this throughout the Group. 
The Audit and Risk Committee maintains a 
critical role in its oversight of the risk agenda 
and the operation of internal controls. 
The Group risk register is a key output of risk 
management activities. It consolidates and 
aggregates risks identified within the various 
business units and overlays those business 
unit risks with risks that materialise at a Group 
level (e.g. financing risks). The CEO and Group 
Finance Director hold a meeting with the Head 
of Internal Audit and Risk Management every 
quarter to review and update the Group Risk 
Register. Once complete, this document forms 
the basis for discussions on risk at Board level 
and is reviewed at each meeting of the Audit 
and Risk Committee. On occasions, the Board 
instructs a review/audit of key risks identified 
in the Group Risk Register to evaluate existing 
mechanisms for mitigating the risk and to 
identify areas for improvement. 01: Strategic Report 02: Governance 03: Financial Statements 04: Company Information
57 Oxford Instruments plc Report and Financial Statements 2017
Following the result of the UK referendum in 
June 2016, the Board instructed the creation 
of a Brexit Committee to identify and report 
on key risks to the Group arising from Brexit. 
The Committee meets on a monthly basis 
and reports to the Management Board. 
A detailed list of Brexit‑related risks has been 
identified and reported. Where relevant, 
mitigating actions have been identified and 
are being monitored. 
The Committee reviewed the system of 
internal financial control on behalf of the 
Board and satisfied itself that the Group is 
meeting the required standards both for the 
year ended 31 March 2017 and up to the 
date of approval of this Report and Financial 
Statements. No concerns were raised with 
the Committee in the year about possible 
improprieties in matters of financial reporting.
In coming to these conclusions, the 
Committee reviewed reports from internal 
audit and from the external auditor on internal 
control findings. It obtained reviews into the 
control environment and risk management 
process and considered the outputs from 
other assurance activities relating to 
operations, health and safety, NPI, human 
resources and IT. 
Whistle-blowing
The Group’s Business Malpractice Policy 
comprises an internal process that has been 
communicated directly to all employees 
by which employees can raise a concern, 
including concerns relating to fraud, 
bribery and/or corruption, damage to the 
environment, criminal activity or danger to 
health and safety, in the knowledge that it 
will be taken seriously, treated as confidential 
and that no action will be taken against the 
employee raising the concern. Reporting 
channels include an independent third party 
provider that provides summary reports to 
the Group Compliance Team (comprising 
the Director of Legal Affairs and the Group 
Internal Audit and Risk Manager). There is 
also provision within the policy for employees 
to raise concerns directly with the Senior 
Independent Director. This policy is reviewed 
annually by the Committee. The Head 
of Internal Audit and Risk Management 
maintains a log of all matters reported through 
the confidential third‑party provider and their 
resolution. No serious matters were reported 
during the year ended 31 March 2017. 
Summary
The Committee has concluded that, as a result 
of its work during the year, it has acted in 
accordance with its terms of reference and 
fulfilled its responsibilities. I will be available 
at the AGM to answer any questions.

Nomination Committee Report
The Committee supports the Board 
in operating a formal, rigorous and 
transparent process for the appointment  
of new Directors to the Board.
Alan Thomson
Chairman of the Nomination Committee
Dear Shareholder,
I am pleased to introduce the Nomination 
Committee report for 2016/17. The 
Committee’s key objective is to support the 
Board in fulfilling its responsibilities to ensure 
there is a formal, rigorous and transparent 
process for the appointment of new Directors 
to the Board and to ensure that effective 
succession planning processes are in place 
across the Group.
There have been a number of changes to 
the membership of the Board over the last 
18 months, culminating with three Directors, 
including Nigel Keen, Chairman, and Jock 
Lennox, Senior Independent Director, stepping 
down at the AGM in September 2016. After 
my appointment as Chairman I undertook a 
review of the composition of the Board and 
determined with the Committee that the 
Board would benefit from the appointment 
of a further Non‑Executive Director who 
could also potentially serve as Senior 
Independent Director. With the help of the 
Zygos Partnership, we have undertaken 
such a search and have met with a number 
of interested candidates. We are pleased to 
report that Stephen Blair has agreed to join 
our Board as a Non‑Executive Director and 
Senior Independent Director with effect from 
1 July 2017.
The Committee will continue to focus 
on ensuring that the present and future 
composition of the Board is appropriate for 
the delivery of the Group’s strategy and that 
all relevant Governance Code requirements 
continue to be met.

The Nomination Committee 
The Nomination Committee comprises 
all the Non‑Executive Directors, under the 
chairmanship of the Chairman of the Board.
• The Committee is responsible for assisting 
the Board in the formal selection and 
appointment of Directors. It considers 
potential candidates and recommends 
appointments of new Directors to 
the Board. 
• The appointments are based on merit 
and against objective criteria including 
time available and the commitment that 
will be required of the potential Director.
• There is a formal, rigorous and 
transparent procedure for the 
appointment of new Non‑Executive 
Directors to the Board, the prime 
responsibility for which is delegated 
to the Nomination Committee. Each 
appointment process begins with an 
evaluation of the balance of skills, 
knowledge and experience existing 
on the Board that is effected through 
a series of meetings between the 
Committee Chairman and Directors. 
• The Nomination Committee 
takes external advice when 
considered appropriate.
• The Committee also considers succession 
planning for the Board and the top level 
of senior management. 
Principal activities of the 
Committee during the year
Constitution of the Board
• Jennifer Allerton advised the Committee 
that she was not putting herself forward 
for re‑election as a Non‑Executive Director 
at the 2016 AGM. As reported last year, 
Jock Lennox and Nigel Keen stood down 
at the 2016 AGM and successors for 
Chairman of the Audit and Risk Chairman 
and Chairman to the Board had already 
been identified and are now in place.
• After the AGM, the Committee carried 
out a review of the constitution of the 
Board. With the changes to the Board in 
2016, and taking into account the skills, 
knowledge and experience on the Board, 
it decided that a further Non‑Executive 
Director be appointed. 
• The Committee evaluated the balance 
of skills, knowledge and experience 
on the Board and used the output of 
this evaluation to identify the skills it 
would like introduced to the Board. 
The Committee, with the help of 
executive search consultants, the Zygos 
Partnership, drew up a description of 
the role and desired capabilities for 
candidates and, taking into account 
both diversity within, and the balance 
of skills on, the Board, developed a 
shortlist of qualifying candidates. 
• Candidates met with the Chairman 
and Chief Executive and the 
proposed candidate met several 
Directors individually. 
• Following these meetings, the 
Nomination Committee considered 
each Director’s feedback and made a 
final recommendation to the Board of 
the appointment of an Independent 
Non‑Executive Director who also 
had the experience necessary to be 
an appropriately qualified Senior 
Independent Director. 
• Following this process, it has been 
announced that Stephen Blair will be 
appointed to the Board as an Independent 
Non‑Executive Director with effect from 
1 July 2017 and will be appointed Senior 
Independent Director from the same date.
All Directors of the Board are put forward for 
re‑appointment by Shareholders each year at 
the AGM and this includes those appointed 
during the year. The Committee, taking into 
account the performance and value that each 
Director brings to the Board, has considered 
whether each of the Non‑Executive and 
Executive Director appointments should be 
renewed for a further year and has confirmed 
that this is indeed the case and accordingly 
a resolution to reappoint each Director will 
be put to Shareholders at the Company’s 
forthcoming AGM. 
Succession planning
• The Group HR Director and the Chief 
Executive presented the work that had 
been carried out within the business on 
succession planning, talent management, 
and leadership, including at Management 
Board and Executive Director level. 
• The Chairman updated the 
Board’s succession plan for 
Non‑Executive Directors. 
Other
• The Nomination Committee also carried 
out its annual review of the performance 
of the Chief Executive and it, excluding the 
Chairman, also reviewed the performance 
of the Chairman.

61 Oxford Instruments plc Report and Financial Statements 2017
Dear Shareholder,
It has been another busy year for the 
Remuneration Committee. On top of the 
usual standing agenda items this year the 
Committee’s time has been spent reviewing 
the Directors’ remuneration policy in 
preparation for our 2017 AGM, which has 
coincided with the appointment of our new 
CEO and GFD and their review of the Group’s 
overall business strategy. 
The former CEO and GFD left during 2016/17. 
Their remuneration arrangements on cessation 
were determined and disclosed in last year’s 
Remuneration Report. Salary, benefits and 
pension were paid to the date of cessation 
with no annual bonus for the period of 
employment during 2016/17 and all long‑term 
incentive awards lapsing on cessation. 
Corporate performance 
and annual bonus payments 
for 2016/17
The annual bonus for 2016/17 is determined 
by a combination of cash, sales and profit 
financial targets, and non‑financial strategic 
targets. As in previous years, the Committee 
set stretching performance targets which 
were clearly linked to the strategy and 
financial performance of the Group. Group 
performance has overall been in line with 
expectations with the organic sales and cash 
conversion targets being met and profit 
before tax just above threshold performance. 
In relation to the strategic targets set for 
a small part of the bonus, the Committee 
carefully reviewed performance against the 
objectives and scored the CEO at 95% and the 
GFD at 100%, noting the strong performance 
of our new Executive Directors in driving 
the strategic repositioning of the Group. 
Full details of the annual bonus outturn of 
56.25% of maximum for the CEO and 57% 
of maximum for the GFD are set out in the 
Annual Report on Remuneration. 
There were no long‑term incentive awards 
with performance periods ending during the 
year under review. 
Review of Remuneration Policy 
Shareholders must approve our Directors’ 
Remuneration Policy at least every three years. 
Our current Policy was approved in 2014 
and re‑approval is therefore required at our 
2017 AGM.
The Remuneration Committee reviewed the 
current policy carefully in light of the evolving 
strategy and concluded that no fundamental 
changes are required to the current quantum 
and structure of pay. Accordingly, limited 
changes will be made as follows:
• greater flexibility to select performance 
conditions for the Performance Share Plan 
(“PSP”) which are best aligned to the 
business strategy, rather than as currently 
having specific measures (EPS and TSR) 
bound into the Policy; 
• adding a two‑year holding period 
on vested PSP awards and increasing 
shareholding guidelines for Executive 
Directors from 100% to 150% of base 
salary, which will bring the policy into line 
with current investor expectations; 
• a harder PSP award limit so that, other 
than in truly exceptional circumstances 
such as recruitment, there is a cap of 
150% of salary, which is aligned to 
the current grant level. Previously the 
PSP limit could be exceeded in normal 
circumstances, up to 250% of salary, with 
shareholder consultation; and
• all incentive payments will ultimately be 
at the discretion of the Committee, which 
may override the formulaic outturn of the 
annual bonus or PSP if, for example, it fails 
to represent the shareholder experience of 
performance over the performance period. 
Implementation of  
Policy for 2017/18
Executive Directors
Effective from 1 July 2017, the Executive 
Directors’ salaries will be increased by 
2.5%, in line with general workforce 
increases. Annual bonus and PSP award 
levels are unchanged at 100% and 150% 
of salary respectively. 
As explained in more detail in our Strategy 
section on pages 12 and 13, our strategy 
focuses on improving the profitability of the 
Group, its capital efficiency and the business 
portfolio to develop higher margin and growth 
businesses. To this end, the performance 
metrics for the incentive awards are being 
adjusted to better mirror these objectives.
Small changes are being made to the 
weighting of metrics for the 2017/18 annual 
bonus with profit before tax (45%), revenue 
growth (10%), cash flow (20%) and strategic 
objectives (25%). This represents a slight shift 
in weighting from revenue (‑10%) to strategic 
objectives (+10%) to link more of the bonus 
to clear and defined strategic objectives as the 
Company undergoes a period of transition. 
There is still significant emphasis on revenue, 
profit and cash to retain a strong focus on 
improving financial performance at the same 
time as strategically repositioning the business. 
Appropriately stretching sliding scales will 
be set for each financial metric, with full 
disclosure of targets and performance against 
them being made in next year’s Report and 
Financial Statements.
For the FY2018 PSP awards a ROCE target will 
be set for 50% of the award in place of the 
current TSR metric. This will provide a tighter 
link to the business strategy over the next few 
years to support and incentivise management 
to make the changes needed to our business 
portfolio by ensuring that there is efficient 
redeployment of our capital into higher

Implementation of Policy  
for 2017/18 continued
Executive Directors continued
EPS growth targets will be set for the other 
50% of the award reflecting the continued 
importance of growth in profitability. The 
Committee considered retaining an element 
of TSR so that there are three metrics but 
this would make the PSP overly complex. 
The two‑year holding period for PSP awards 
and enhanced share ownership requirements 
will ensure that there is a strong long term 
alignment of interest between executives and 
Shareholders, particularly in the absence of a 
TSR measure. 
The targets set for the annual bonus and PSP 
awards take into account the impact of the 
recently announced disposal of our Industrial 
Analysis business and the EPS and ROCE 
targets for the 2017/18 PSP awards are set 
out in the Annual Report on Remuneration. 
Non‑Executive Directors’ fees
Following a Board review, the Non‑Executive 
Director fees, which were last reviewed in 
July 2014, will be increased by 8% from 
1 July 2017. The Chairman’s fee will increase 
by 2.5%, in line with the salary increases 
for the general workforce. In addition, 
the additional fee for the role of Senior 
Independent Director will increase from 
£5,000 to £7,500. The additional fee for 
chairing the Remuneration and Audit and 
Risk Committees remains at £7,500.
Conclusion
Two resolutions on remuneration will be 
brought to Shareholders at our AGM to be 
held on 12 September 2017. The first is the 
binding vote to approve our new Policy and 
the second is the annual advisory vote to 
approve the Annual Report on Remuneration, 
which sets out the remuneration outcomes for 
the year under review and how the policy will 
be implemented for the year ahead. 
I hope that you will be supportive of both 
resolutions. If you have any queries in the 
meantime I will be pleased to engage with 
you either at the AGM or beforehand.
Yours sincerely

Part A: Directors’ Remuneration Policy
This part of the Remuneration Report sets out the Group’s remuneration policy for its Directors. As it is three years since our 
last policy vote, a revised Policy will be submitted to a binding Shareholder vote at our AGM on 12 September 2017. Subject to 
shareholder approval the new Policy will take effect from that date and, unless changed with Shareholders’ prior agreement, 
will stay in place until September 2020.
Summary of the changes to the 
current Remuneration Policy
The Committee is proposing some changes 
to the current Policy to bring it in line with 
latest investor guidance and to provide a 
little more flexibility in its operation. There 
are no changes proposed to actual quantum 
or structure.
The changes are as follows:
• the normal Performance Share Plan award 
limit is reduced from 250% of base salary 
to 150% of base salary. This lower limit 
reflects the current PSP grant level and our 
needs for the policy period. Awards can 
only be made to the 250% of salary limit 
in truly exceptional circumstances; 
• there will be flexibility to choose a broader 
range of performance metrics for the 
Performance Share Plan than the current 
policy of just EPS and TSR; 
• there will be an explicit provision for the 
Committee to be able to over‑ride the 
formulaic outturn of any incentive payment 
if, for example, there are circumstances 
where such a payment fails to reflect wider 
company performance and shareholder 
experience;
• there will be a two‑year holding period 
applied to vested PSP awards for awards 
granted in 2017/18 onwards; and
• share ownership guidelines will be 
increased from 100% to 150% of 
base salary.
Policy overview
The remuneration Policy promotes the delivery 
of the Group’s strategy and seeks to align the 
interests of Directors and Shareholders. The 
Committee regularly reviews the link between 
its incentive structures and strategy to ensure 
that remuneration packages are appropriate 
to attract, motivate and retain the high calibre 
Executives that are needed to deliver the 
Group’s strategy. 
The Company seeks to reward Executives 
fairly and responsibly based on Group 
performance and their individual contribution. 
The Company has a strategy aimed at 
delivering significant, balanced and sustainable 
long‑term growth and it is important 
for motivation and retention that the 
remuneration of the Executives reflects this. 
The Committee considers carefully the 
motivational effects of the incentive structure 
in order to ensure that it is effective and 
does not have any unintentionally negative 
impact on matters such as governance, 
environmental or social issues. More generally, 
the Committee ensures that the overall 
Remuneration Policy does not encourage 
inappropriate risk taking. 
Other matters taken 
into consideration in 
determining policy 
The Committee reviews the Executive 
Directors’ packages periodically, taking 
account of the level of remuneration 
paid for comparable positions in similar 
companies. Comparative pay data is used 
carefully recognising the potential for an 
upward ratchet in remuneration caused by 
over‑reliance on such data. 
In determining the remuneration of the 
Executive Directors, the Committee also 
takes into account the general trends in pay 
and conditions across the Group as a whole. 
The Committee seeks to ensure that the 
underlying principles which form the basis for 
decisions on Directors’ pay are consistent with 
those on which pay decisions for the rest of 
the workforce are taken. Employees are not 
currently consulted on Executive pay. However, 
the Committee will keep this under review.
The Committee considers feedback from 
Shareholders received at each AGM, together 
with any feedback from additional meetings, 
as part of any review of Executive Director 
remuneration. In addition, the Committee 
engages proactively with Shareholders where 
any material changes to the remuneration 
policy are proposed.  64 Oxford Instruments plc Report and Financial Statements 2017

Remuneration Policy
The following table summarises the key features of our Remuneration Policy.
Element of pay Purpose and link to strategy Operation Maximum opportunity 
Base salary • To provide a competitive and appropriate 
level of basic fixed pay to recruit and 
retain superior talent and avoid excessive 
risk taking that might otherwise result 
from an over‑reliance on variable 
remuneration.
• Reflects the experience, performance and 
responsibilities of the individual.
• Reviewed annually with any increase 
usually effective 1 July.
• Takes account of experience, 
performance and responsibilities as well 
as the performance of the Company, 
the complexity of the role within the 
Group and salary increases for employees 
generally. 
• Set with regard to market data 
for comparable positions in 
similar companies in terms of size, 
internationality, business model, structure 
and complexity, including within 
the industry. 
• There is no maximum or maximum 
annual increase.
• Higher increases than the average 
percentage for the workforce may be 
appropriate, for example, where an 
individual changes role, where the 
complexity of the Group changes, where 
an individual is materially below market 
comparators or is appointed on a below 
market salary with the expectation 
that his/her salary will increase with 
experience and performance. 
Benefits • Provided on a market‑competitive 
basis, aids retention and follows reward 
structure for all employees.
• Currently include but are not limited 
to the cost of:
• life assurance;

efficiently at the Head Office and 
other Company sites.

amendment from time to time by the 
Committee within this policy.
• Relocation costs and other incidental 
expenses may be provided as necessary 
and reasonable.
• Benefits are not part of 
pensionable earnings.

cap. Benefit costs are monitored and 
controlled and represent a small element 
of total remuneration costs. 
Pension • To provide a market‑competitive benefit 
for retirement.

financial metrics and the balance on 
non‑financial strategic metrics.

misstatement, error or misconduct.
• 75% of salary at year end payable at 
target performance.
• 100% of salary at year end payable for

65 Oxford Instruments plc Report and Financial Statements 2017
Element of pay Purpose and link to strategy Operation Maximum opportunity 
Long-term 
incentives
• To incentivise the Executives and reward 
them for meeting stretching targets in 
the long term which accrue substantial 
value to and align the Directors’ interests 
with Shareholders’.
• Facilitates share ownership to provide 
further alignment with Shareholders.
• Annual awards under the 2014 
Performance Share Plan of performance 
shares (or nil‑cost options) with 
vesting subject to achievement of 
performance targets. Both the vesting 
and performance period will be over a 
minimum of three years.
• The Committee will set targets each 
year based on long‑term financial 
performance and/or a stock market 
based metric.
• 25% of the awards will vest at threshold 
performance under each performance 
condition.
• Clawback may be applied for 
misstatement, error or misconduct.
• For PSP awards granted from 2017/18, 
vested awards must be held for a further 
two years before sale of the shares (other 
than to pay tax).
• The maximum normal award limit 
is 150% of salary. This limit may be 
exceeded in exceptional circumstances 
e.g. recruitment, up to the limit in the 
PSP rules of 250% of base salary. 
• Dividend equivalents may accrue on the 
PSP awards over the vesting period and 
for awards granted from 2018 to the end 
of the post vesting holding period and 
be paid out either as cash or as shares 
on vesting or at the end of the holding 
period as appropriate and in respect of 
the number of shares that have vested.
All-employee 
share schemes
• To encourage employee share 
participation.
• The Company may from time to time 
operate tax‑approved share schemes 
(such as the HMRC‑approved Share 
Incentive Plan (“SIP”)) for which 
executive Directors could be eligible.
• The SIP is open to all UK permanent staff 
employed for at least six months.
• The schemes are subject to the limits 
set by tax authorities.
Shareholding 
guideline
• To further align Executive Directors’ 
interests with Shareholders’.
• The Committee has established 
shareholding guidelines which encourage 
the Executive Directors to build and 
retain a holding of Company shares 
equivalent to 150% of base salary.
• Until the guideline is met in full, 
Executive Directors are expected to 
retain or acquire shares equivalent to 
the value of 50% of the net amount 
realised from exercise/ vesting of share 
awards as appropriate after allowing for 
tax payable.
• Not applicable.
Non-Executive 
Director fees
• To remunerate the Chairman and  
Non‑Executive Directors.
• Reviewed annually.
• Determined and reviewed taking into 
account time commitment, experience,

role as well as market data for similar 
roles in other companies of a similar size 
and/or business to Oxford Instruments.
• Out of pocket expenses including travel 
may be reimbursed by the Company in 
accordance with the Company’s expenses 
policy including tax thereon “grossed 
up” as appropriate.
• There is no prescribed maximum 
or maximum annual increase. 66 Oxford Instruments plc Report and Financial Statements 2017
Remuneration Report continued
Differences in the Remuneration 
Policy of the Executive Directors 
and the general employees
There are no material differences in the 
structure of remuneration arrangements 
for the Executive Directors and senior 
management population, aside from quantum 
and participation levels in incentive schemes, 
which reflect the fact that a greater emphasis 
is placed on performance‑related pay for 
Executive Directors and the most senior 
individuals in the management team. Outside 
the senior management team, the Company 
aims to provide remuneration structures for 
employees which reflect market norms. 
Choice of performance measures 
and approach to setting targets
The Committee selects financial and strategic 
measures for the annual bonus that are key 
performance indicators for the business over 
the short term. For the long‑term incentives, 
the Committee will select a combination 
of measures that provide a good focus on 
the outcomes of the Company strategy 
together with sustainable improvements 
in long‑term profitability. 
The Committee sets appropriate and 
demanding targets for variable pay in the 
context of the Company’s trading environment 
and strategic objectives. The targets for 
the annual bonus plan will be set each 
year with reference to the Company’s 
budget and business and strategic plan. 
The Committee will review the performance 
conditions and targets for awards under the 
PSP each year prior to awards being made 
taking account of the Company’s internal 
financial planning, market forecasts and the 
business environment. 
Discretions retained by the 
Committee in operating its 
incentive plans
The Committee may adjust the formula‑driven 
outturn for an annual bonus or PSP 
performance condition in the event that 
the Committee considers that the quantum 
would be inappropriate in light of wider 
Company performance or overall shareholder 
experience. Any such use of discretion 
would be detailed in the Annual Report 
on Remuneration in Part B.
The Committee operates the Group’s various 
incentive plans according to their respective 
rules and in accordance with HMRC rules 
where relevant. To ensure the efficient 
administration of these plans, the Committee 
may apply certain operational discretions. 
These include the following:
• select the participants in the plans;
• determine the timing of grants  
and/or payments;
• determine the quantum of grants  
and/or payments;
• determine the extent of vesting based  
on the assessment of performance;
• determine “good leaver” status, and 
where relevant, the extent of vesting in 
the case of the share‑based plans;
• where relevant determine the extent of 
vesting in the case of share‑based plans 
in the event of a change of control;
• making the appropriate adjustments 
required in certain circumstances (e.g. 
rights issues, corporate restructuring 
events, variation of capital and special 
dividends); and
• the annual review of weighting of 
performance measures, and setting targets 
for annual bonus plan and discretionary 
share plans from year to year.
The Committee may adjust the targets and/or 
set different measures and alter weightings for 
existing annual bonus plan and share‑based 
awards only if an event occurs which causes 
the Committee to reasonably consider that the 
performance conditions would not without 
alteration achieve its original purpose and the 
varied conditions are no less difficult to satisfy 
than the original conditions. Any changes, and 
the rationale for those changes, will be set out 
clearly in the Annual Report on Remuneration 
in respect of the year in which they are made.
Legacy arrangements
In approving this Directors’ Remuneration 
Policy, authority is given to the Company 
to honour any commitments entered into 
with current or former Directors (such as 
the payment of a pension or the vesting or 
exercise of past share awards) that have been 
disclosed to and approved by Shareholders 
in previous remuneration reports. Details of 
any payments to former Directors will be set 
out in the Annual Report on Remuneration as 
they arise.

1. Fixed pay comprises salary levels as at 1 July 2017, pension contribution of 14% and the value of benefits received in 
2016/17.
2. The on‑target level of bonus is 75% of the maximum opportunity, i.e. 75% of salary. 
3. The on‑target level of vesting under the annual PSP is taken to be 50% of the face value of the award at grant,  
i.e. 75% of salary.
4. The maximum level of bonus and vesting under the PSP is 100% of the bonus opportunity and 100% of the face value of the 
PSP award at grant, i.e. 100% and 150% of salary respectively.
5. No share price appreciation has been assumed for the PSP awards and for simplicity SIP awards, as well as dividend 
equivalents, are excluded.  01: Strategic Report 02: Governance 03: Financial Statements 04: Company Information
67 Oxford Instruments plc Report and Financial Statements 2017
Recruitment and promotion 
policy for Executive Directors
In setting total remuneration levels and in 
considering quantum for each element of 
the package for a new Executive Director, the 
Committee takes into account the skills and 
experience of the individual, the market rate 
for a candidate of that experience and the 
importance of securing the relevant individual.
The Company seeks to align the remuneration 
package with the Remuneration Policy 
approved by Shareholders, including the 
maximum plan limit for the long‑term 
incentives and an annual bonus entitlement in 
line with that of the other Executive Directors. 
Salary is provided at such a level as required 
to secure the most appropriate candidate. 
For new appointments base salary and total 
remuneration may be set initially at below 
normal market rates on the basis that it may 
be increased once expertise and performance 
has been proven and sustained.
Specific variable remuneration performance 
targets can be introduced for an individual 
where necessary for the first year of 
appointment if it is appropriate to do so to 
reflect the individual’s responsibilities and the 
point in the year in which he or she joined 
the Board.
Flexibility is retained to offer additional cash 
and/or share‑based payments on appointment 
in respect of deferred remuneration or benefit 
arrangements forfeited on leaving a previous 
employer. The Committee would look to 
replicate the arrangements being forfeited 
as closely as possible and in doing so, will 
take account of relevant factors including 
the nature of the deferred remuneration, 
performance conditions, attributed expected 
value and the time over which they would 
have vested or been paid. Such awards may 
be made under the terms of the PSP or as 
permitted under the Listing Rules.
For an internal appointment, any variable 
pay element awarded in respect of the prior 
role may be allowed to pay out according to 
its terms, adjusted as relevant to take into 
account the appointment. In addition, any 
other ongoing remuneration obligations 
existing prior to appointment may continue. 
For external and internal appointments, the 
Committee may agree that the Company will 
meet certain relocation, legal and any other 
incidental expenses as appropriate. 
Executive Directors’ service contracts and policy on cessation
Details of the service contracts of the Executive Directors, available for inspection at the 
Company’s registered office and at the Company’s AGM, are as follows:
  Unexpired 
 Contract date term of contract
Ian Barkshire 11 May 2016 Rolling contract
Gavin Hill 9 February 2016 Rolling contract
Details of contractual terms and the policy on cessation of employment are summarised in the 
table below.
Contractual 
provision Detailed terms
Notice period Twelve months by the Company or by the Director.
Termination  
payment
A Director’s service contract may be terminated without notice and without any 
further payment or compensation, except for sums accrued up to the date of 
termination, in the event of gross misconduct. 
For termination in other circumstances, the Company has a right to pay salary in 
lieu of the notice period (or part thereof) if it so determines.
In addition, any statutory entitlements in connection with the termination would 
be paid as necessary, and at the Committee’s discretion if deemed necessary 
and appropriate outplacement, legal fees and settlement of claims or potential 
compensation claims.
Remuneration 
entitlements 
Pro‑rata bonus may also become payable for the period of active service along with 
vesting for outstanding share awards (in certain circumstances – see below).
Change  
of control
No Executive Director’s contract contains additional provisions in respect of a 
change of control. 
Any share‑based entitlements granted to an Executive Director under the Company’s share plans 
will be determined based on the relevant plan rules. The default treatment for existing awards 
is that any unvested awards lapse on cessation of employment. However, in certain prescribed 
circumstances, such as death, injury, ill health, disability, retirement or other circumstances at 
the discretion of the Committee, “good leaver” status may be applied. For good leavers, under 
the ESOS awards will vest at cessation to the extent the performance condition is satisfied, but 
with the Committee having discretion to vest on the normal vesting date if appropriate and to 
waive the performance condition. Under the 2014 PSP , awards to good leavers will vest on the 
normal vesting date, subject to the satisfaction of the relevant performance conditions at that 
time and be scaled back to reflect the proportion of the performance period actually served. 
The Committee has discretion in exceptional circumstances to disapply time pro‑rating and/or to 
measure performance to and vest awards at the date of cessation. Vesting at cessation would be 
the default position where a participant dies.
In the event of a takeover, awards vest to the extent the performance condition is satisfied and 
are scaled back to reflect the actual period of service with the Committee having the discretion, 
acting fairly and reasonably, not to scale back. 68 Oxford Instruments plc Report and Financial Statements 2017
Remuneration Report continued
External appointments
The Board encourages Executive Directors to 
accept appropriate external Non‑Executive 
appointments provided the aggregate 
commitment is compatible with their duties 
as Executive Directors. The Executive Director 
concerned may retain fees paid for these 
services, which will be subject to approval by 
the Board. Currently, Executive Directors do 
not hold any outside Directorships.
Non-Executive Directors 
For the appointment of a new Chairman or 
Non‑Executive Director, the fee arrangement 
would be in accordance with the approved 
remuneration policy in place at the time.
Non‑Executive Directors do not have service 
contracts but are appointed under letters of 
appointment for an initial period of three 
years with subsequent reviews. Non‑Executive 
Director appointments are now renewed for 
periods of one year terminating at the next 
AGM. Their appointment can be terminated 
without notice and with no compensation 
payable on termination, other than accrued 
fees and expenses.

PART B: Annual Report on Remuneration 
The financial information in this part of the report has been audited where indicated.
The Remuneration Committee (unaudited)
The Remuneration Committee (the “Committee”) is responsible for recommending to the Board 
the remuneration packages for Executive Directors and has oversight of the bonus and share 
incentive strategy for the Group’s executive management. The Chairman and the Executive 
Directors are responsible for determining the remuneration of the Non‑Executive Directors, 
and the Remuneration Committee, with the exception of the Chairman, is responsible for 
determining the remuneration of the Chairman. 
The role of the Committee includes:
• considering and determining the remuneration policy for the Executive Directors;
• within this agreed policy, considering and determining the various elements and total 
remuneration packages of each Executive Director of the Company;
• approving the design and performance targets for all performance‑related plans for 
Executives as well as the overall total payments made under such plans;
• reviewing and noting remuneration trends across the Group and considering these in terms 
of the Executive Directors’ remuneration; and
• determining the policy for pension arrangements, service agreements, recruitment terms and 
termination payments to Executive Directors.
The members of the Committee are appointed by the Board and currently comprise all the 
Independent Non‑Executive Directors: Thomas Geitner, Richard Friend, Mary Waldner; and the 
Chairman of the Board, Alan Thomson. Thomas Geitner is the Chairman of the Committee. 
All members served throughout the year except for Alan Thomson who joined the Board and 
the Committee on 1 June 2016. Nigel Keen, Jennifer Allerton and Jock Lennox served on the 
Committee until they ceased to be Directors of the Company on 13 September 2016. 
The Chief Executive, the Group HR Director and other Executives are invited to attend 
Committee meetings as deemed appropriate. For example the Chief Executive is able to make a 
significant contribution when considering the performance of other Executive Directors and to 
discuss the wider Group remuneration policy and structure and terms and conditions affecting 
other employees. However, no Executive Director is present when the Committee is determining 
his or her remuneration.

The Committee acts within its agreed written terms of reference (which are published on the company’s website:  
www.oxford-instruments.com/investors) and complied with the provisions of the 2014 UK Corporate Governance Code regarding 
remuneration. 
The performance of the Committee is reviewed at least once a year as part of the wider Board evaluation process.
During the year the Committee fulfilled its duties, as laid down in the Committee’s terms of reference. 
New Bridge Street (a trading name of Aon Hewitt Limited and part of Aon plc) (“NBS”) was the Committee’s independent remuneration 
consultants until September 2016. The Committee conducted a tender process to appoint a new remuneration consultant over the summer and 
from this process Korn Ferry Hay Group (“KFHG”) was appointed the Committee’s independent remuneration consultants from September 2016. 
NBS and KFHG were appointed by the Committee to provide advice on all aspects of Executive remuneration as required by the Committee. 
NBS and KFHG are signatories to the Remuneration Consultants’ Code of Conduct and each has confirmed to the Committee that it adheres to 
the Code. During the year KFHG met with the Committee Chairman to discuss remuneration matters which are of particular relevance to the 
Company and how best it can work with the Committee to meet the Company’s needs.
Fees are charged predominately on a “time‑spent” basis. The total fees paid for the advice provided to the Committee during the year to NBS was 
£13,400 and to KFHG was £15,000. 
During the year in question Aon Hewitt Limited acted as both Scheme Actuary and Scheme Administrator to the Company’s UK defined benefit 
pension scheme and the Scheme Actuary also provided the Company with its IAS 19 pension calculations and non‑contentious pension advice. 
The Committee is satisfied that the advice it has received from NBS is objective and independent.

Bonus 
It has been a year of structural, operational and strategic transition for the Group. Against this background of strategic activity, the business 
delivered a stable performance in line with expectations against an extremely challenging market backdrop of slower academic funding in the 
US and Europe and the deterioration of the OI Healthcare business. The NanoTechnology Tools sector performed strongly. 
As in previous years, the Committee set stretching performance targets for the annual bonus which are clearly linked to the strategy and financial 
performance of the Group. The organic sales and cash conversion targets were met in full paying out at 100% of the maximum for those 
measures. Adjusted PBT was slightly above threshold with 4.45% of that part of the bonus being payable. The targets set at the beginning of the 
year were based on the OST wire business being part of the Group for the full year. In assessing performance against the organic sales target the 
Committee therefore adjusted the sales outcome to recognise the part‑year contribution of the business to the date of disposal.

The Committee carefully reviewed performance against the strategic objectives set for the annual bonus which were critical to laying the 
foundations for future growth. For the CEO, these comprised targets relating to developing a new vision for the Group and an executable strategy 
to develop sustainable growth and margin improvement, building an effective leadership team, relieving pressure on the balance sheet as well as 
building his leadership profile across the Group and in the investment community. For the GFD, his strategic targets comprised improving financial 
reporting processes and developing key KPIs, building efficiencies across the federal office and finance structures, delivering a strategic and 
investment plan for the US healthcare business and leading the implemention of the new ERP system to deliver business efficiencies in a timely 
and cost effective manner. 
The maximum payable under this element of their bonus arrangements is 15% of salary. As identified elsewhere in the Annual Report there has 
been excellent progress made against the business objectives and after careful consideration of each of the objectives set and what has been 
achieved during the year, the Committee concluded that the personal strategic objectives were achieved at a level of 95% of the maximum award 
for the CEO and 100% of the maximum award for the GFD.
The on‑target and maximum bonus potentials for the Executive Directors as well as the amount actually payable for the year ended 31 March 2017

Long Term Incentive Plans (audited)
Both Jonathan Flint and Kevin Boyd held PSP awards granted in October 2014 and June 2015 with a three‑year performance period and vesting 
on the third anniversary of grant. All unvested awards held by these Executives were forfeited on their cessation and the performance targets 
were not tested as the awards lapsed before the end of the performance period. There are no other share awards held by Executive Directors with 
performance periods ending in 2016/17.

Achievement of performance conditions (unaudited)
The calculation of the TSR performance conditions are independently measured. EPS performance conditions are measured using the audited 
accounts of the Company. All performance conditions are then verified by the Remuneration Committee. 
Dilution limits (unaudited)
The Company’s share plans provide that overall dilution through the issuance of new shares for employee share schemes should not exceed an 
amount equivalent to 10% of the Company’s issued share capital over a ten‑year period. The SIP scheme only uses market purchased shares.
The Committee monitors the position prior to the making of any award under these share schemes to ensure that the Company remains within 
this limit. As at the date of this Report, the Company’s headroom position remains within the 10% limit. 
Shareholding requirements (audited)
The Executive Directors are required to build and retain a shareholding in the Company equivalent in value to 100% of basic salary (increasing 
to 150% of basic salary for 2017/18). Until the requirement is met, whenever ESOS or 2014 PSP awards are exercised Executive Directors are 
expected to retain or purchase shares equivalent to the value of 50% of the net amount realised from exercise of the awards after allowing for 
tax payable.

Pension arrangements 
Executive Director Pension Arrangements (audited)
Under the terms of their service contracts, Executive Directors can ask the Company to contribute to a pension plan of their choice. The Company 
contributes a maximum of 14% of base salary. Only base salary is pensionable and contributions are not included in the calculation of bonus and 
share award entitlements. Where the Company’s pension contribution exceeds the annual allowance a balancing payment is paid by the Company 
to the Director, which is taxed as income. In line with the policy for all UK employees, this cash payment is reduced by 12.12% to cover employer’s 
national insurance costs.
During the year, the Company contributed £7,478 (2016: £11,786) into the Company’s Group Personal Pension Plan in respect of Ian Barkshire 
and £9,167 (2016: n/a) into a personal defined contribution plan in respect of Gavin Hill. Balancing payments to 14% of base salary (net of 
employer’s national insurance contributions) were paid as cash. 
Ian Barkshire is a deferred member of the defined benefit scheme and is no longer accruing benefits in the scheme. In accordance with the 
rules of the Scheme his deferred benefits are subject to increases in line with statutory revaluation. The transfer value of his accrued benefits at 
31 March 2017 was £579,101 (2016: £444,608). 
Payments for loss of office (audited)

Performance graph and CEO’s remuneration (unaudited)
The graph below shows for the nine years ended 31 March 2017 the Total Shareholder Return (“TSR”) on a holding of the Company’s ordinary 
shares compared with a hypothetical holding of shares made up of shares of the same kind and number as those by reference to which the FTSE 
SmallCap, FTSE Techmark and FTSE 350 Electronic and Electrical Equipment indices are calculated. These indices have been chosen as they are 
considered to be the most appropriate comparator groups for the Company. TSR has been calculated by reference to the relevant share price for 
each constituent company assuming dividends are reinvested.
This graph shows the value, by 31 March 2017, of £100 invested in Oxford Instruments plc on 31 March 2009 compared with the value of £100 
invested in the FTSE SmallCap, FTSE250, FTSE Techmark and FTSE 350 Electronic and Electrical Equipment indices. The other points plotted are the 
values at intervening financial year ends.

How the policy will be applied in 2017/18 (unaudited)
Base salaries
In line with the general workforce, the Executive Directors will receive salary increases of 2.5% for 2017/18 effective from 1 July 2017. The CEO’s 
salary as a result of the increase will be £420,250 and the GFD’s £328,000.
Benefits and pension
These will be made in accordance with the approved policy. Benefits will be in line with those received in 2016/17. The Committee has authorised 
that the CEO may use the services of a chauffeur for travel to and from work to enable him to make best use of his travelling time.
Annual bonus
The maximum opportunity under the annual bonus plan for 2017/18 will be 100% of base salary for both the CEO and GFD. 01: Strategic Report 02: Governance 03: Financial Statements 04: Company Information
75 Oxford Instruments plc Report and Financial Statements 2017
A combination of financial (75%) and non‑financial strategic (25%) metrics will be used to determine the level of payment under the annual bonus 
and as detailed in the table below:
 Weighting as a % of opportunity
Measure        CEO GFD
Organic sales (£m)        10% 10%
Profit (£m)        45% 45%
Cash generation (£m)        20% 20%
Strategic objectives        25% 25%
Non‑financial strategic objectives have been agreed and are broadly linked to the development and implementation of the Horizon strategy. 
The Committee has chosen not to disclose, in advance, the performance targets for the forthcoming year as these include matters which the 
Committee considers commercially sensitive. Retrospective disclosure of the performance against them will be made in next year’s Annual Report 
on Remuneration to the extent the targets are not commercially sensitive at that time.
Long‑term incentives in respect of the 2017/18 financial year
The 2017/18 PSP awards will be over shares with a market value at grant of 150% of salary for the CEO and GFD. Vesting will be subject to the 
performance conditions as set out below measured over a three‑year performance period commencing 1 April 2017. 
Half of the award Half of the award
EPS growth – 4% p.a. (25% vesting) to 10% p.a. (100% vesting)  ROCE 13.0% in the final year of the performance period 
over three financial years commencing with the 2017/18 financial year. (2019/20 financial year) (25% vesting) to 15.5% (100% vesting).
The EPS and ROCE targets are based on the underlying business performance (excluding the disposal of the Industrial Analysis (“IA”) business). 
The Committee is comfortable that these targets remain equivalently stretching as prior to the disposal. However, the Committee has agreed to 
review the targets once the transaction has completed and all necessary adjustments have been made to the Financial Statements to exclude the 
effect of IA. If, on its review at that time, the Committee concludes that the targets set are not as stretching as prior to the IA disposal then an 
appropriate adjustment will be made at that time. Any subsequent adjustments to the base year or actual targets, as appropriate to take account

Report of the Directors
The Directors present their Report and the 
Financial Statements of Oxford Instruments plc 
for the year ended 31 March 2017.
Principal activity and  
business reviews
The Company is the ultimate holding company 
of a group of subsidiary undertakings 
(“the Group”) engaged in the research, 
development, manufacture, rental, sale and 
service of high technology tools and systems. 
The Company is required to set out in this 
report a true and fair view of the business of 
the Group during the financial year ended 
31 March 2017, the position of the Group at 
the end of the financial year and a description 
of the principal risks and uncertainties facing 
the Group. The information which fulfils 
these requirements includes an Operations 
and Finance Review on pages 14 to 33 and 
Corporate Responsibility on pages 34 to 
41, which are incorporated in this report by 
reference. The operations, the strategic review, 
the research and development activities 
and likely future prospects of the Group are 
reviewed in the Strategic Report on pages 
1 to 41.
Results and dividends
The results for the year are shown in the 
Consolidated Statement of Income on 
page 90. The Directors recommend a final 
dividend of 9.3 pence per ordinary share, 
which together with the interim dividend of 
3.7 pence per ordinary share makes a total 
of 13.0 pence per ordinary share for the year 
(2016: 13.0 pence). Subject to Shareholder 
approval, the final dividend will be paid on 
19 October 2017 to Shareholders registered at 
close of business on 22 September 2017.
Risks and uncertainties
The Board exercises proper and appropriate 
corporate governance for the Group. 
It ensures that there are effective systems 
of internal controls in place to manage 
Shareholders’ interests and the Group’s 
assets, including the assessment and the 
management of the risks to which the 
businesses are exposed, and to monitor 
and manage the compliance with all the 
legal requirements that affect the Group’s 
worldwide business activities. However, such 
systems are designed to manage rather than 
eliminate the risk of failure to achieve business 
objectives and can provide only reasonable 
and not absolute assurance against material 
misstatement or loss.
The Executive Directors report to the Board on 
changes in the business and in the external 
environment which may affect the risks which 
the Group faces. The Executive Directors also 
provide the Board with monthly financial 
information. Key performance indicators are 
reviewed periodically.
There are a number of risks and uncertainties 
which may have a material effect on the 
Oxford Instruments Group. These are 
described in KPIs and Principal Risks on pages 
22 to 25.
Directors
Biographies of all the Directors at the date 
of this report, including the Non‑Executive 
Directors, appear on pages 42 and 43. 
During the year:
• Alan Thomson was appointed an 
Independent Non‑Executive Director on 
1 June 2016 and succeeded Nigel Keen as 
Chairman of the Board after the AGM on 
13 September 2016;

• Nigel Keen retired as Chairman  
of the Board;
• Jennifer Allerton stepped down as a 
Non‑Executive Director; and
• Jock Lennox stepped down as a 
Non‑Executive Director and Senior 
Independent Director.
Directors’ conflicts of interest
With effect from 1 October 2008, the 
Companies Act 2006 allows Directors of public 
companies to authorise conflicts and potential 
conflicts of interest, where appropriate. Only 
Directors with no interest in the matter under 
consideration may participate in the relevant 
decision and in doing so they must act in a 
way which they consider in good faith will be 
most likely to promote the Company’s success. 
A conflicts policy has been drawn up and a 
register of conflicts and potential conflicts 
is maintained.
Directors’ interests
The beneficial interests of the Directors in the 
Company’s share capital, all in fully paid up 
shares at 31 March 2017, are shown below.
Details of share options for the Executive 
Directors are shown in the Directors’ 
Remuneration Report on pages 60 to 75.

No Director was beneficially interested in the 
shares of any subsidiary company at any time 
during the year. In the year to 31 March 2017 
no Director had a material interest in any 
contract of significance with the Company or 
any of its subsidiaries other than as described 
in the Directors’ Remuneration Report on 
pages 60 to 75. Since the year end, there have 
been no changes to the above shareholdings. 01: Strategic Report 02: Governance 03: Financial Statements 04: Company Information
77 Oxford Instruments plc Report and Financial Statements 2017
Insurance cover and  
Directors’ indemnities
For a number of years, the Group has 
purchased insurance to cover its Directors 
and Officers against their costs in defending 
themselves in legal proceedings taken 
against them in that capacity and in respect 
of damages resulting from the unsuccessful 
defence of any proceedings. In addition, to 
the extent permitted by UK law, the Group 
indemnifies its Directors and Officers for 
liabilities arising from such proceedings.
Neither the insurance nor the indemnity 
provides cover for situations where the 
Director has acted fraudulently or dishonestly.
Share capital
The Company only has one class of share 
capital which comprises ordinary shares of 
5 pence each. All shares forming part of the 
ordinary share capital have the same rights 
and carry one vote each. There are no unusual 
restrictions on the transfer of a share. The 
full rights and obligations attaching to the 
Company’s ordinary shares, as well as the 
powers of the Directors, are set out in the 
Company’s Articles of Association, a copy of 
which is available on the Company’s website. 
These can also be obtained from Companies 
House or by writing to the Company Secretary.
During the year to 31 March 2017 the issued 
share capital was increased by 0.03% with the 
issue of 17,005 ordinary shares (2016: 7,575) 
following the exercise of options under 
the Company’s share option schemes. 
At 31 March 2017, the issued share capital 
of the Company was therefore 57,315,916 
ordinary shares of 5 pence each. In connection 
with the Company’s equity incentive 
plans, a separately administered trust held 
183,145 ordinary shares at 31 March 2017 
(representing 0.3% of the total issued share 
capital of the Company). No shares in the 
Company were acquired by the Company 
during the year (2016: nil). Details of the 
share capital and options outstanding as at 
31 March 2017 are set out in Notes 24 and 
13 respectively to the Financial Statements. 
At this year’s Annual General Meeting, the 
Directors propose to renew the authorities 
granted to them at last year’s AGM to: 
a) allot ordinary shares up to an aggregate 
nominal value of one‑third of the 
Company’s issued share capital and, where 
full pre‑emption rights are applied, up to 
an aggregate nominal value of two‑thirds 
of the Company’s issued share capital; 
b) allot ordinary shares up to an aggregate 
nominal value of 10% of the Company’s 
issued share capital without first offering 
them to existing Shareholders; and 
c) buy back up to 10% of the Company’s 
issued share capital. 
Shareholders will be requested to renew these 
authorities at the AGM, details of which are 
set out in the notice of the meeting.
Substantial shareholdings
The following are beneficial interests of 3% or 
more (where the holding is direct), or of 5% 
or more (where the holding is indirect), which 
have been notified to the Directors of the 
Company, in accordance with Chapter 5 of 
the Disclosure and Transparency Rules, of the 
Company’s issued ordinary share capital, the 
only class of voting capital, at 5 June 2017:

Lady KA Wood Direct 3,105,530 5.4
Baillie Gifford & Co Indirect 2,917,516 5.1
Payment of suppliers
The Group does not follow a standard 
payment practice but agrees terms and 
conditions for its business transactions with 
each of its suppliers. Payment is then made 
in accordance with these terms. At 31 March 
2017 trade creditors of the Company and the 
Group’s UK subsidiaries were equivalent to 
5 days (2016: 26) and 64 days (2016: 74) of 
purchases respectively, based on the amounts 
invoiced by suppliers during the year and the 
amounts owed to trade creditors at the end 
of the year.
Charitable donations
During the year, the Group made charitable 
donations of £8,585 (2016: £2,542). There 
have been no political donations during 
the year.
Fixed assets
Whilst the market value of some fixed assets 
may differ from book value, the Directors 
believe that the differences are not material. 
Disclosure of  
information to auditor
Pursuant to Section 418(2) of the Companies 
Act 2006 the Directors who held office at 
the date of approval of this Directors’ Report 
confirm that, so far as they are each aware, 
there is no relevant audit information of which 
the Company’s auditor is unaware; and each 
Director has taken all the steps that he or she 
might reasonably have been expected to have 
taken as a Director to make himself or herself 
aware of any relevant audit information and to 
establish that the Company’s auditor is aware 
of that information.
Annual General Meeting
The Notice of the Annual General Meeting 
to be held on 12 September 2017 is set out 
in a letter to Shareholders together with 
explanatory notes relating to the resolutions.
A resolution to re‑appoint KPMG LLP as 
Auditor and to authorise the Directors to set 
their remuneration will be proposed at the 
Annual General Meeting.
Change of control arrangements
There are a number of agreements that take 
effect, alter or terminate upon a change of 
control of the Company following a takeover, 
such as banking agreements and company 
share plans. On a change of control, the 
Company’s committed credit facilities may 
be cancelled by lenders by giving not less 
than three days’ notice. It is also possible that 
pension plan funding arrangements would 
need to be changed following a change of 
control if that resulted in a weakening of the 
employer covenant.

Board announced that it has agreed to sell 
its Industrial Analysis business to Hitachi 
High‑Technologies Corporation for a 
consideration of £80 million. The transaction 
is subject to regulatory approval in Austria, a 
share transfer filing in China and completion 
of a pre‑sale reorganisation to carve out the 
relevant businesses. Assuming satisfaction of 
these conditions, the transaction is expected  
to close in the second quarter of the 
2017/18 fiscal year. Further details on 
the announcement can be found at

79 Oxford Instruments plc Report and Financial Statements 2017
The Directors are responsible for preparing 
the Annual Report and the Group and Parent 
Company Financial Statements in accordance 
with applicable law and regulations. 
Company law requires the Directors to 
prepare Group and Parent Company Financial 
Statements for each financial year. Under that 
law they are required to prepare the Group 
Financial Statements in accordance with IFRSs 
as adopted by the EU and applicable law and 
have elected to prepare the Parent Company 
Financial Statements in accordance with UK 
Accounting Standards, including FRS 101 
Reduced Disclosure Framework. 
Under company law, the Directors must not 
approve the Financial Statements unless they 
are satisfied that they give a true and fair view 
of the state of affairs of the Group and Parent 
Company and of their profit or loss for that 
period. In preparing each of the Group and 
Parent Company Financial Statements, the 
Directors are required to: 
• select suitable accounting policies and then 
apply them consistently; 
• make judgements and estimates that are 
reasonable and prudent; 
• for the Group financial statements, state 
whether they have been prepared in 
accordance with IFRSs as adopted by 
the EU; 
• for the Parent Company Financial 
Statements, state whether applicable UK 
Accounting Standards have been followed, 
subject to any material departures 
disclosed and explained in the Parent 
Company Financial Statements; and 
• prepare the Financial Statements on 
the going concern basis unless it is 
inappropriate to presume that the Group 
and the Parent Company will continue 
in business. 
The Directors are responsible for keeping 
adequate accounting records that are 
sufficient to show and explain the Parent 
Company’s transactions and disclose 
with reasonable accuracy at any time the 
financial position of the Parent Company 
and enable them to ensure that its financial 
statements comply with the Companies 
Act 2006. They have general responsibility 
for taking such steps as are reasonably 
open to them to safeguard the assets of 
the Group and to prevent and detect fraud 
and other irregularities. 
Under applicable law and regulations, the 
Directors are also responsible for preparing a 
Strategic Report, Directors’ Report, Directors’ 
Remuneration Report and Corporate 
Governance Statement that comply with that 
law and those regulations. 
The Directors are responsible for the 
maintenance and integrity of the corporate 
and financial information included on the 
Company’s website. Legislation in the UK 
governing the preparation and dissemination 
of financial statements may differ from 
legislation in other jurisdictions. 
Responsibility statement of the 
Directors in respect of the annual 
financial report
We confirm that to the best of our knowledge:
• the Financial Statements, prepared in 
accordance with the applicable set of 
accounting standards, give a true and 
fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial 
position and profit or loss of the Company 
and the undertakings included in the 
consolidation taken as a whole; and
• the Strategic Report/Directors’ Report 
include a fair review of the development 
and performance of the business and the 
position of the issuer and the undertakings 
included in the consolidation taken as 
a whole, together with a description of 
the principal risks and uncertainties that 
they face.
We consider the annual report and accounts, 
taken as a whole, is fair, balanced and 
understandable and provides the information 
necessary for Shareholders to assess the 
Group’s position and performance, business 
model and strategy.

Independent Auditor’s Report 
to the members of Oxford Instruments plc only
Opinions and conclusions arising from our audit
1. Our opinion on the financial statements is unmodified
We have audited the financial statements of Oxford Instruments plc for the year ended 
31 March 2017 set out on pages 90 to 133. In our opinion:
• the financial statements give a true and fair view of the state of the group’s and of the parent 
company’s affairs as at 31 March 2017 and of the group’s loss for the year then ended; 
• the group financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with International 
Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union;
• the parent company financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with UK 
Accounting Standards, including FRS 101 Reduced Disclosure Framework; and
• the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the 
Companies Act 2006; and, as regards the group financial statements, Article 4 of the 
IAS Regulation. 
2. Our assessment of risks of material misstatement
• In arriving at our audit opinion above on the financial statements the risks of material 
misstatement that had the greatest effect on our audit, in decreasing order of audit 
significance, were as follows (unchanged from 2016 with the exception of the removal of 
Valuation of Investment in Associate):
• We continue to perform procedures over the investment in associate. However, due to the 
group equity accounting for this investment it has not been fair valued in the year and so we 
have not assessed this as one of the risks that had the greatest effect on our audit. It is not 
therefore separately identified in our report this year.
The risk Our response
Recoverability of acquired intangible assets 
(£160.7 million (2016: £201.0 million))
Risk vs 2016 t u
Refer to page 54 (Audit committee report), 
page 84 (accounting policy) and pages 108 to 110 
(financial disclosures) 
Forecast based valuation:
The Group balance sheet includes a significant 
amount of goodwill and other acquired intangible 
assets that have arisen as a result of acquisitions.
Goodwill and other acquired intangibles, 
particularly in the OI Healthcare and Asylum 
businesses, are at risk of impairment due to weaker 
than forecast demand and market changes.
The OI Healthcare market has faced significant 
challenges due to a change in software licensing 
policy on second hand systems from one of the 
main system manufacturers which has reduced 
its income.
In the NanoTechnology Tools division performance 
in the Asylum business has been lower than 
expected having been affected by reduced 
academic funding levels and delays in launching 
new products.
Furthermore, there is inherent uncertainty and 
complexity involved in estimating future cash flows, 
long-term growth rates and discount rates that are 
the basis for the assessment of recoverability and, 
as such, this is one of the key judgement areas our 
audit is focussed on. 
Our procedures included:
Benchmarking assumptions: Performing our 
own assessment of the key assumptions used to 
estimate recoverable amount such as forecast cash 
flows, long-term growth rates and the discount rate 
applied with reference to historical performance 
of similar lines of business and externally derived 
data including, industry growth rates and market 
interest rates.
Control design: Testing the budgeting procedures 
upon which the cash flow forecasts are based. 
Historical comparisons: Considering historical 
forecasting accuracy, by comparing previously 
forecasted cash flows to actual results achieved.
Comparing valuations: Comparing the sum of 
the discounted cash flows to the group’s market 
capitalisation to assess the reasonableness of those 
cash flows. 
Sensitivity Analysis: Performing our own 
sensitivity analysis in relation to the key 
assumptions.
Assessing transparency: Assessing whether 
the Group’s disclosures regarding the sensitivity 
of the impairment assessment, to changes 
in key assumptions, appropriately reflected 
the risks inherent in the valuation of acquired 
intangible assets.

Risk vs 2016 q
The risk has decreased in significance in comparison 
to the prior year as a result of a no bill and hold 
transactions being recorded at the period end.
Refer to page 84 (accounting policy) and pages 
97 to 99 (financial disclosures)
2017/2018 sales:
There is a risk that revenue is recognised on 
sales of individual products produced by the 
Group’s NanoTechnology Tools segment before 
the significant risks and rewards of ownership 
have passed. 
Given the complex nature of the products, 
judgement is required in determining whether 
the risks and rewards have passed by assessing 
a number of factors, notably, whether shipping 
terms have been met, customer acceptance 
of the product received and the complexity of 
any installation element of the sale. As such 
there is a risk that, revenue is recognised in the 
incorrect period. 
Furthermore, due to the seasonality of the business, 
a significant proportion of NanoTechnology Tools 
divisional revenue is recognised in period 12 
resulting in an increased risk of revenue being 
recognised in the incorrect period. 
Consequently this is one of the key areas our audit 
is focussed on. 
Our procedures included:
Tests of details
Testing, on a sample basis, whether specific 
revenue transactions around the year end had been 
recognised in the appropriate period by assessing 
whether the significant rewards of ownership had 
passed, with reference to, nature of products, the 
terms of sale within the associated contracts, the 
status of customer acceptance of the product and 
the relative complexity of product installation. 
Considering whether a sample of credit notes 
issued after the year end should reduce revenue in 
the period and challenging those that were not by 
obtaining evidence.
Assessing a sample of year end deferred and 
accrued income against contractual terms and 
evidence of transfer of risks and rewards to 
determine whether revenue for this sample has 
been recognised in the correct period.
Completeness and accuracy of provisions in 
respect of product related claims
Risk vs 2016 t u
Refer to page 54, page 84 (accounting policy) 
and page 121 (financial disclosures)
Omitted exposure:
The Group designs and builds customised, 
high technology products, notably in the 
NanoTechnology Tools segment, and as such there 
is a risk that the Group is subject to customer claims 
in respect of products not meeting contractual 
specifications.
In addition, since the Group’s products incorporate 
specific complex design features and intellectual 
property there is a risk that the Group inadvertently 
infringes the intellectual property belonging to 
third parties. 
This could result in a material unrecorded provision 
for compensation required to be paid to customers 
or third parties respectively.
Subjective estimate:
The estimation of any provision required for product 
related claims is inherently subjective based on the 
wide range of potential outcomes.
Omitted exposure procedures:
Management enquiry: Enquiring with Group 
management and Group’s internal legal counsel 
regarding new and previously unrecorded product 
related claims and the likelihood of the claims.
Compliance data scrutiny: Inspecting the 
Group’s litigation register for unrecorded claims 
and assessing whether a provision is required for 
these claims.
Considering the specific circumstances around 
claims which have arisen by inspecting 
correspondence between the Group and other 
parties, such as legal advisors and customers. 
Subjective estimate procedures:
Our sector experience: Challenging the 
reasonableness of the key assumptions made 
by the Group, such as potential royalty rates 
payable in respect of intellectual property claims, 
estimates of amounts payable to customers in 
respect of claims relating to a failure to meet 
bespoke product specification and likelihood of an 
outflow of resources, against our own expectations 
based on our historical knowledge, experience, 
and understanding.
Personnel interviews: Evaluating assumptions 
through discussion of claims with internal legal 
counsel and relevant management. 
Benchmarking assumptions: Assessing the level 
of provisions held against the nature and status of 
claims, range of possible outcomes and likelihood 
discussed in the correspondence between the 
Group and legal advisors and customers. 82 Oxford Instruments plc Report and Financial Statements 2017

3. Our application of materiality 
and an overview of the scope 
of our audit
The materiality for the financial statements 
as a whole was set at £1.1 million 
(2016: £0.9 million). This has been 
determined with reference to a benchmark 
of group profit before tax from continuing 
operations normalised for the items disclosed 
in Note 1 to the financial statements, 
excluding amortisation of acquired intangibles, 
of £22.2 million, of which it represents 5.0% 
(2016: same basis, 4.4%). 
We report to the audit committee any 
corrected or uncorrected misstatements 
exceeding £55,000 (2016: £45,000), in 
addition to other identified misstatements that 
warranted reporting on qualitative grounds.
Of the Group’s 70 (2016: 65) reporting 
components, 15 (2016: 17) were subject 
to audit procedures for group reporting 
purposes. The components within the scope 
of our work accounted for 93% (2016: 93%) 
of total group revenue; 92% (2016: 82%) of 
group loss before taxation from continuing 
operations; and 89% (2016: 89%) of total 
group assets. 
For the remaining components, we 
performed analysis at an aggregated group 
level to re-examine our assessment that 
there were no significant risks of material 
misstatement within these. The Group 
audit team instructed component auditors 
as to the significant areas to be covered, 
including the relevant risks detailed above 
and the information to be reported back. 
The Group audit team approved each 
component teams audit materiality, which 
ranged from £0.6 million to £0.8 million 
(2016: £0.4 million to £0.7 million), having 
regard to the size and risk profile of the 
Group across the components. 
The Group audit team visited 12 (2016: 19) 
component locations in the UK, United States, 
Germany and Sweden (2016: UK, United 
States and Germany). The work performed 
for the US components was undertaken by 
the Group audit team. Telephone conference 
meetings were also held with the component 
auditors in China (2016: China and Japan). 
At these visits and meetings, the findings 
reported to the Group audit team were 
discussed in more detail, and any further work 
required by the Group audit team was then 
performed by the component auditor. The 
Group audit team reviewed the significant 
risk areas of the component audit files for 
individually financially significant components.
The group team performed procedures on the 
items excluded from normalised group profit 
before tax.

Report to be audited has been properly 
prepared in accordance with the 
Companies Act 2006; and
• the information given in the Strategic 
Report and the Directors’ Report for 
the financial year is consistent with the 
financial statements.
Based solely on the work required to be 
undertaken in the course of the audit of the 
financial statements and from reading the 
Strategic Report and the Directors’ Report:
• we have not identified material 
misstatements in those reports; and 
• in our opinion, those reports have 
been prepared in accordance with the 
Companies Act 2006. 
5. We have nothing to report on 
the disclosures of principal risks
Based on the knowledge we acquired during 
our audit, we have nothing material to add or 
draw attention to in relation to:
• the directors’ statement of viability 
assessment on pages 26 and 27, 
concerning the principal risks, their 
management, and, based on that, the 
directors’ assessment and expectations of 
the group’s continuing in operation over 
the 3 years to March 2020; or
• the disclosures on page 27 concerning 
the use of the going concern basis of 
accounting.
6. We have nothing to report 
in respect of the matters on 
which we are required to report 
by exception
Under ISAs (UK and Ireland) we are required to 
report to you if, based on the knowledge we 
acquired during our audit, we have identified 
other information in the annual report that 
contains a material inconsistency with either 
that knowledge or the financial statements, 
a material misstatement of fact, or that is 
otherwise misleading.
In particular, we are required to report to 
you if:
• we have identified material inconsistencies 
between the knowledge we acquired 
during our audit and the directors’ 
statement that they consider that the 
annual report and financial statements 
taken as a whole is fair, balanced 
and understandable and provides the 
information necessary for shareholders 
to assess the group’s position and 
performance, business model and strategy;

committee. 
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are 
required to report to you if, in our opinion:
• adequate accounting records have not 
been kept by the parent company, or 
returns adequate for our audit have not

statements and the part of the Directors’ 
Remuneration Report to be audited are not 
in agreement with the accounting records 
and returns; or
• certain disclosures of directors’ 
remuneration specified by law are not 
made; or
• we have not received all the information 
and explanations we require for our audit.
Under the Listing Rules we are required 
to review:

13 June 2017 84 Oxford Instruments plc Report and Financial Statements 2017
Oxford Instruments plc (the “Company”) is 
a company incorporated and domiciled in 
the UK.
The Group Financial Statements have been 
prepared and approved by the Directors 
in accordance with International Financial 
Reporting Standards as adopted by the EU 
(“Adopted IFRS”). The Company has elected 
to prepare its Parent Company Financial 
Statements in accordance with FRS 101; 
these are presented on pages 124 to 133.
The accounting policies set out below 
have, unless otherwise stated, been applied 
consistently to all periods presented in these 
Group Financial Statements.
The Financial Statements have been prepared 
on a going concern basis based on the 
Directors’ opinion, after making reasonable 
enquiries, that the Group has adequate 
resources to continue in operational existence 
for the foreseeable future.
The Group’s business activities, together 
with the factors likely to affect its future 
development, performance and position, are 
set out in the Strategy section on pages 11 
to 13. The financial position of the Group, its 
cash flows, liquidity position and borrowing 
facilities are described in the Finance Review 
on pages 28 to 33.
The relatively diverse nature of the Group 
together with its current financial strength 
provides a solid foundation. The Directors have 
reviewed the Group’s forecasts and flexed 
them to incorporate a number of potential 
scenarios relating to changes in trading 
performance and believe that the Group will 
be able to operate within its existing debt 
facilities which expire between February 2021 
and March 2022. This review also considered 
hedging arrangements in place. As a 
consequence, the Directors believe that the 
Group is well placed to manage its business 
risks successfully. Further information can be 
found in the Viability Statement on page 26.
The Financial Statements were authorised for 
issuance on 13 June 2017.
(a) New accounting standards
The following standards and interpretations 
are applicable to the Group and have been 
adopted as they are mandatory for the year 
ended 31 March 2017:
• Amendments to IFRS 2 – 
Share-based Payments;
• Amendments to IFRS 3 – 
Business Combinations;
• Amendments to IFRS 8 –  
Operating Segments;
• Amendments to IFRS 13 –  
Fair Value Measurement;
• Amendments to IAS 16 –  
Property, Plant and Equipment;
• Amendments to IAS 24 –  
Related Party Disclosures; and
• Amendments to IAS 38 –  
Intangible Assets.
The adoption of these standards has not 
had a material impact on the financial 
statements. There are no other new standards, 
amendments to standards or interpretations 
mandatory for the first time for the year 
ended 31 March 2017.
(b) Basis of preparation
The Financial Statements are presented in 
Sterling, rounded to the nearest £0.1m and 
are prepared on the historical cost basis except 
as described on page 85 under the heading 
“Financial instruments”.
The preparation of Financial Statements 
in conformity with adopted IFRSs requires 
management to make judgements, estimates 
and assumptions that affect the application of 
policies and reported amounts of assets and 
liabilities, income and expenses. The estimates 
and associated assumptions are based on 
historical experience and various other factors 
that are believed to be reasonable under 
the circumstances, the results of which form 
the basis of making the judgements about 
carrying values of assets and liabilities that 
are not readily apparent from other sources. 
Actual results may differ from these estimates.
The estimates and underlying assumptions 
are reviewed on an ongoing basis. The most 
significant judgements and estimates made 
in applying the Group accounting policies 
relate to:
Impairment of intangible assets 
(including goodwill), tangible assets 
and investment in associate
Goodwill is held at cost and tested annually 
for impairment. Amortised intangibles, 
tangible assets and the Group’s investment 
in associate are tested for impairment where 
there are indications of impairment. These 
impairment tests require the Group to make 
an estimate of the expected cash flows and to 
select suitable discount rates. These require an 
estimation of the value in use of these assets 
(see Notes 7 and 17).
Provisions
Provisions are recognised in the period 
when it becomes probable that there will 
be a future outflow of funds resulting 
from past expectations or events which 
can be reasonably estimated. The timing 
of recognition requires the application of 
judgement to existing facts and circumstances 
which can be subject to change. Amounts 
provided represent the Group’s best 
estimate of exposure based on currently 
available information.
Key assumptions surrounding estimation 
uncertainty relate to future warranty costs 
of the Group’s products, which are based on 
historical return rates and any known product 
quality issue; as well as estimating potential 
royalty or profit sharing rates surrounding any 
product-related intellectual property claims.
Revenue recognition
Revenue is recognised when, in the opinion of 
the Group, the significant risks and rewards 
of ownership have transferred to the buyer. 
The complex technical nature of the Group’s 
products, particularly in the NanoTechnology 
Tools sector, means that the application 
of judgement is required in determining 
whether those risks and rewards have passed 
by assessing a number of factors, notably 
whether shipping terms have been met, 
customer acceptance of the product received 
and the complexity of any installation element 
of the sale.
Accounting Policies  01: Strategic Report 02: Governance 03: Financial Statements 04: Company Information
85 Oxford Instruments plc Report and Financial Statements 2017
The following other significant judgements 
and estimates were made in applying the 
Group accounting policies:
Measurement of defined benefit 
scheme liabilities
The Group recognises and measures costs 
relating to defined benefit pension schemes 
in accordance with IAS 19 (Revised) Employee 
Benefits. In applying IAS 19 (Revised) the costs 
are assessed in accordance with the advice of 
independent qualified actuaries. This requires 
the exercise of judgement in relation to the 
estimation of future changes in salaries and 
inflation, as well as mortality rates, expected 
returns on plan assets and the selection 
of suitable discount rates. Further detail is 
provided in Note 26.
Capitalised development costs
Capitalised development costs involve 
judgements around the future economic 
benefits that will flow from the associated 
development activity and in particular the 
Group’s assessment of the technical and 
commercial feasibility of the product to 
be developed.
Deferred tax assets
A deferred tax asset is recognised in the 
period if it is probable that future taxable 
profits will be available against which the asset 
can be utilised. This requires the exercise of 
judgement in relation to the estimation of 
future taxable profit.
Revisions to accounting estimates are 
recognised in the period in which the estimate 
is revised if the revision affects only that period 
or in the period of the revision and future 
periods if the revision affects both current and 
future periods. The key areas where estimates 
have been used and assumptions applied are 
in the calculation of provisions, the valuation 
of acquired intangible assets, the impairment 
testing of goodwill and the estimation of 
defined benefit pension plan liabilities. 
Contingent purchase consideration 
Contingent purchase consideration is 
measured at fair value at the date of 
acquisition and tested annually against 
the criteria for payment, with movements 
in fair value being recorded in the Income 
Statement. The key judgements involved 
are the estimation of future cash flows and 
profitability of the acquired business and the 
selection of a suitable discount rate.
Fair value measurements on business 
combinations (prior year risk only)
The measurement of fair values on a business 
combination requires the recognition and 
measurement of the identifiable assets, 
liabilities and contingent liabilities.  
The key judgements involved are:
• the identification and valuation of 
intangible assets which require the 
estimation of future cash flows and the 
selection of a suitable discount rate  
(see Note 17); and
• the initial valuation of investment in 
Scienta Scientific AB which required 
the estimation of future cash flows and 
the selection of a suitable discount rate 
(see Note 7).
(c) Basis of consolidation
The Group Financial Statements include the 
accounts of Oxford Instruments plc and its 
subsidiary companies adjusted to eliminate 
intra-Group balances and any unrealised gains 
and losses or income and expenses arising 
from intra-Group transactions.
Subsidiaries are entities controlled by the 
Group. Control exists when the Group is 
exposed to or has rights to variable returns 
from its investment with the investee and has 
the ability to affect those returns through its 
power over the investee. In assessing control, 
potential voting rights that are currently 
exercisable or convertible are taken into 
account. The results of subsidiary companies 
are included in the consolidated Financial 
Statements from the date that control 
commences until the date that control ceases. 
The acquisition method is used to account for 
the acquisition of subsidiaries.
Associates are those entities in which the 
Group holds more than 20% of the shares 
and voting rights and has significant influence, 
but not control, over the financial and 
operating policies. 
The Group financial information includes the 
Group’s share of the total comprehensive 
income of the associate on an equity 
accounted basis, from the date that significant 
influence commences until the date that 
significant influence ceases. When the 
Group’s share of losses exceeds its interest 
in associate, the Group’s carrying amount is 
reduced to £nil and recognition of further 
losses is discontinued except to the extent that 
the Group has incurred legal or constructive 
obligations or made payments on behalf of 
an associate.
The assets and liabilities of foreign operations, 
including goodwill and fair value adjustments 
arising on consolidation, are translated into 
Sterling at exchange rates ruling at the end of 
the reporting period. Income statements and 
cash flows of foreign operations are translated 
into Sterling at average monthly exchange 
rates which approximate foreign exchange 
rates at the date of the transaction. Foreign 
exchange differences arising on retranslation 
are recognised directly in a separate 
translation reserve.
(d) Foreign currency
An individual entity’s transactions in foreign 
currencies are translated at the foreign 
exchange rate ruling at the date of the 
transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities 
denominated in foreign currencies at the 
reporting date are translated at the foreign 
exchange rate ruling at that date. Foreign 
exchange differences arising on translation 
are recognised in profit or loss. Non-monetary 
assets and liabilities that are measured in 
terms of historical cost in a foreign currency 
are translated using the exchange rate at the 
date of the transaction.
(e) Financial instruments
Financial assets and liabilities are recognised 
in the Group’s Consolidated Statement of 
Financial Position when the Group becomes 
a party to the contractual provisions of the 
instrument. Derivative financial instruments of 
the Group are used to hedge its exposure to 
interest rate, foreign currency and commodity 
pricing risks arising from operational, financing 
and investment activities. The Group does not 
hold or issue derivative financial instruments 
for trading purposes. All derivatives are 
initially recognised at fair value; attributable 
transaction costs are recognised in profit or 
loss as incurred. Derivatives comprising interest 
rate swaps, foreign exchange contracts and 
options and metal futures contracts are 
classified as “fair value through profit and 
loss” under IAS 39, unless designated as 
hedges. Subsequent to initial recognition, 
derivatives are measured at fair value and 
gains or losses on the settlement of such 
derivatives are recognised in operating 
expenses. Where such derivatives relate to the 
following year’s exposure, any gains or losses 
resulting from the change in fair value are 
taken to the mark-to-market gains/(losses) line 
within financial income or expense. 86 Oxford Instruments plc Report and Financial Statements 2017
Accounting Policies continued
(e) Financial instruments continued
Changes in the fair value of the derivative 
hedging instruments designated as cash flow 
hedges are recognised in equity to the extent 
that the hedge is effective. To the extent that 
the hedge is ineffective, changes in fair value 
are recognised in the Consolidated Statement 
of Income. If the hedging instrument 
no longer meets the criteria for hedge 
accounting, expires or is sold, terminated 
or exercised, then hedge accounting is 
discontinued prospectively. The cumulative 
gain or loss previously recognised in equity 
remains there until the forecast transaction 
occurs. When the hedged item is a non-
financial asset, the amount recognised in 
equity is transferred to the carrying amount of 
the asset when it is recognised. In other cases 
the amount recognised in equity is transferred 
to the Consolidated Statement of Income in 
the same period that the hedged item affects 
profit or loss.
The fair value of interest rate swaps is based 
on broker quotes. Those quotes are tested 
for reasonableness by discounting estimated 
future cash flows based on the terms and 
maturity of each contract and using market 
interest rates for a similar instrument at the 
measurement date.
The fair value of forward exchange contracts 
is their market price at the Consolidated 
Statement of Financial Position date, being the 
present value of the forward price. The gain 
or loss on remeasurement to fair value of 
forward exchange contracts is recognised 
immediately in the Consolidated Statement 
of Income.
Contingent purchase consideration is 
measured at fair value at the date of 
acquisition and subsequently carried at fair 
value, with movements recognised in the 
Income Statement. 
Interest-bearing borrowings are recognised 
initially at fair value less attributable 
transaction costs. Subsequent to initial 
recognition, interest-bearing borrowings are 
stated at amortised cost with any difference 
between cost and redemption value being 
recognised in profit or loss over the period of 
the borrowing on an effective interest basis.
(f) Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment is stated at 
historical cost less provisions for impairment 
(see accounting policy l) and depreciation 
which, with the exception of freehold land 
which is not depreciated and rental assets 
(see below), is provided on a straight-line basis 
over each asset’s estimated economic life. 
Depreciation is provided based on historical 
cost less estimated residual value. The 
principal estimated economic lives used for 
this purpose are:
• Freehold buildings, long  50 years 
leasehold land and buildings 
• Leasehold improvements  Period 
(less than 50 years’ duration)  of lease 
• Furniture and fittings 10 years 
• Machinery and other  5 to 10 
equipment years 
• Computer equipment 4 years 
• Vehicles 4 years
Fixed assets held for rental as part of the 
Group’s service business are depreciated using 
the reducing balance method at a rate of 3% 
per month.
Proceeds on disposal of rental assets which 
have been refurbished by the Group are 
recorded as revenue with associated costs 
recorded in cost of sales. Otherwise gains and 
losses on disposal of an item of property, plant 
and equipment are determined by comparing 
the proceeds from disposal with the carrying 
amount of property, plant and equipment and 
are recognised in the Income Statement.
(g) Intangible assets
(i) Goodwill
All business combinations are accounted for 
by applying the acquisition method. Goodwill 
represents amounts arising on acquisition of 
subsidiaries. In respect of business acquisitions 
that have occurred since 31 March 2004, 
goodwill represents the difference between 
the cost of the acquisition and the fair value of 
the assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities 
acquired. In respect of acquisitions prior to this 
date, goodwill is included on the basis of its 
deemed cost, which represents the amount 
recorded under previous GAAP .
The Group expenses transaction costs 
associated with its acquisitions and 
movements in liabilities relating to contingent 
consideration within the Income Statement in 
conformity with IFRS 3. 
Goodwill arising on acquisitions is stated at 
cost less any accumulated impairment losses 
and allocated to cash generating units that are 
anticipated to benefit from the combination. 
It is not amortised but is tested annually for 
impairment (see accounting policy l), or more 
frequently when there is an indicator that the 
unit may be impaired.
(ii) Development costs
Research and Development costs are charged 
to the Consolidated Statement of Income in 
the year in which they are incurred unless 
development expenditure is applied to a 
plan or design for the production of new or 
substantially improved products, in which 
case they are capitalised. The criteria for 
capitalisation include demonstration of the 
technical feasibility of completing a new 
intangible asset that will be available for sale 
and that the asset will generate probable 
future economic benefits. Where expenditure 
meets the criteria, development costs are 
capitalised and amortised through the 
Consolidated Statement of Income over their 
useful economic lives.
(iii) Acquired intangible assets
An intangible asset acquired with a subsidiary 
undertaking is recognised as an intangible 
asset if it is separable from the acquired 
business or arises from contractual or 
legal rights, is expected to generate future 
economic benefits and its fair value can be 
reliably measured. The asset is amortised 
through the Consolidated Statement of 
Income over it useful economic life.
(iv) Amortisation
Amortisation of intangible assets is charged to 
the Consolidated Statement of Income on a 
systematic basis in proportion to the use of the 
assets over their estimated useful economic 
lives as follows:
• Capitalised development  3 to 5 
costs years 
• Technology related  5 to 12 
acquired intangibles years 
• Customer related  6 months 
acquired intangibles to 15 years 
• Development costs  10 years 
acquired intangibles
• Software 10 years 01: Strategic Report 02: Governance 03: Financial Statements 04: Company Information
87 Oxford Instruments plc Report and Financial Statements 2017
(h) Trade and other receivables
Trade and other receivables are initially 
recognised at fair value and subsequently 
stated at their amortised cost less appropriate 
allowances for amounts which are expected to 
be non-recoverable.
(i) Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and 
net realisable value. Cost includes materials, 
direct labour, an attributable proportion 
of production overheads based on normal 
operating capacity and all other expenditure 
incurred in acquiring the inventories and 
bringing them to their existing location and 
condition. Net realisable value is the estimated 
selling price in the ordinary course of business, 
less the estimated costs of completion and 
selling expenses.
Provision is made for obsolete, slow-moving 
and defective stock where appropriate in light 
of recent usage, expected future requirements, 
new product introduction plans and likely 
realisable values.
(j) Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents are carried 
in the Statement of Financial Position at 
amortised cost.
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash 
balances and call deposits and are carried 
at amortised cost. Bank overdrafts that are 
repayable on demand and form an integral 
part of the Group’s cash management are 
included as a component of cash and cash 
equivalents for the purpose of the Statement 
of Cash Flows.
(k) Non-current assets  
held for sale
A non-current asset is classified as held for 
sale if its carrying amount will be recovered 
principally through sale rather than through 
continuing use, it is available for immediate 
sale and sale is highly probable within 
one year.
Immediately before classification as held for 
sale, the measurement of the assets is brought 
up-to-date in accordance with applicable IFRS. 
Then, on initial classification as held for sale, 
non-current assets are recognised at the lower 
of their carrying amount and fair value less 
costs to sell.
Impairment losses on initial classification as 
held for sale are included in the Consolidated 
Statement of Income, even when the asset 
has previously been revalued. The same 
applies to gains and losses on subsequent 
remeasurement.
(l) Impairment of  
non-current assets
All non-current assets are tested for 
impairment whenever events or circumstances 
indicate that their carrying value may be 
impaired. Additionally, goodwill is subject 
to an annual impairment review.
For the purposes of impairment testing assets 
are grouped together into the smallest group 
of assets that generates cash flows from 
continuing use that are largely independent of 
the cash inflows from other groups of assets.
An impairment loss is recognised in the 
Consolidated Statement of Income as under 
the administration and shared services 
heading, to the extent that an asset’s carrying 
value, or a cash generating unit’s carrying 
value, exceeds its recoverable amount, which 
represents the higher of its net realisable value 
and its value in use. Value in use is the present 
value of the future cash flows expected to 
be derived from the asset or from the cash 
generating unit to which it relates. The present 
value is calculated using a discount rate that 
reflects the current market assessment of the 
time value of money and the risks specific to 
the asset concerned.
Impairment losses recognised in previous 
periods for an asset other than goodwill 
are reversed if there has been a change 
in estimates used to determine the asset’s 
recoverable amount, but only to the extent 
that the carrying amount of the asset does 
not exceed its carrying amount had the 
impairment loss not been recognised in 
previous periods. Impairment losses in respect 
of goodwill are not reversed.
Impairment losses recognised in respect of 
cash generating units are allocated first to 
reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill 
allocated to cash generating units and then 
to reduce the carrying amount of the other 
assets in the unit.
(m) Employee benefits
The Group operates a number of defined 
benefit and defined contribution plans 
which require contributions to be made to 
independent trustee-administered funds. 
(i) Defined contribution plans
Obligations for contributions to defined 
contribution pension plans are recognised as 
an expense in the Consolidated Statement of 
Income as incurred.
(ii) Defined benefit plans
The Group’s net obligation in respect of 
defined benefit pension plans is calculated 
separately for each plan by estimating the 
amount of future benefit that current and 
past employees have earned in return for 
their service in prior periods. That benefit is 
discounted to determine its present value 
and the fair value of any plan assets is 
deducted. The calculation is performed by 
a qualified actuary using the projected unit 
credit method.
All actuarial gains and losses in calculating the 
Group’s net obligation are recognised in the 
Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive 
Income in the year.
The charge to the Consolidated Statement 
of Income reflects the current service cost. 
The interest expense or income is calculated 
on the net defined benefit liability by 
applying the discount rate to the net defined 
benefit liability, and is included within 
financial expenditure or financial income 
in the Consolidated Statement of Income 
respectively.
(iii) Share-based payment transactions
The fair value of equity-settled share option 
programmes is measured at grant date and 
charged to the Consolidated Statement 
of Income, with a corresponding increase 
in equity, on a straight-line basis over the 
period during which the employees become 
unconditionally entitled to the options. The 
fair value of the options granted is measured 
using an option valuation model, taking into 
account the terms and conditions upon which 
the options were granted.
The amount recognised as an expense is 
adjusted to reflect the actual number of share 
options that vest, except where forfeiture is

(n) Provisions
A provision is recognised in the Consolidated 
Statement of Financial Position when the 
Group has a present legal or constructive 
obligation as a result of a past event and it is 
probable that an outflow of economic benefits 
will be required to settle the obligation. 
A provision for warranty and product related 
liability is recognised when the underlying 
products are sold. A provision for restructuring 
is recognised when the Group has approved 
a detailed and formal restructuring plan and 
the restructuring has either commenced or 
has been announced publicly. A provision 
for onerous contracts is recognised when 
the expected benefits to be derived by the 
Group from a contract are lower than the 
unavoidable cost of meeting its obligations 
under the contract. A provision for a claim 
or dispute is made when it is considered 
probable that an adverse outcome will 
occur and the amount of the loss can be 
reasonably estimated.
Contractual and other provisions represent the 
Directors’ best estimate of the cost of settling 
future obligations where the Directors, taking 
into account professional advice received, 
assess that it is more likely than not that such 
proceedings may be successful.
If the effect is material, provisions are 
determined by discounting the expected 
future cash flows at a pre-tax rate that reflects 
current market assessments of the time value 
of money and, where appropriate, the risks 
specific to the liabilities.
(o) Trade and other payables
Trade and other payables are initially 
recognised at their fair value and subsequently 
stated at amortised cost.
(p) Government grants
Grants from Governments are recognised at 
their fair value where there is a reasonable 
assurance that the grant will be received 
and the Group will comply with all 
attached conditions. 
Government grants relating to costs are 
deferred and recognised in the Income 
Statement over the period necessary to match 
them with the costs they are intended to 
compensate. Government grants relating to 
property, plant and equipment are included 
in other current liabilities and are credited to 
the Income Statement on a straight-line basis 
over the expected useful economic lives of the 
related assets.
(q) Interest-bearing borrowings
Interest-bearing borrowings are recognised 
initially at fair value less attributable 
transaction costs. Subsequent to initial 
recognition, interest-bearing borrowings are 
stated at amortised cost with any difference 
between cost and redemption value being 
recognised in the Income Statement over 
the period of the borrowings on an effective 
interest basis.
(r) Revenue
Revenue is recognised in the Consolidated 
Statement of Income when the significant 
risks and rewards of ownership have 
transferred to the buyer. In the Industrial 
Products segment this is generally considered 
to be on dispatch, as products have a low 
level of customisation, are manufactured on a 
routine basis and typically have no installation 
requirement. In the NanoTechnology Tools 
segment products are generally bespoke 
and customer contracts more complex. 
As such, there are a number of conditions 
which must be satisfied before revenue can 
be recognised. These can include: legal; 
contractual ownership; passing internal quality 
control testing; dispatch from manufacturing 
sites; installation at customer sites; customer 
inspection both before and after installation; 
and/or, ultimately, customer acceptance. 
Given these conditions, a greater degree of 
consideration is given as to whether the terms 
of sale have been met and whether revenue 
can be recognised for each product. In the 
Service segment, revenue for maintenance 
and support is recognised on a pro-rata 
basis over the length of the contract period. 
Revenue relating to the rental of machinery 
is recognised on a straight-line basis over the 
life of the lease. Where the Service segment 
makes asset sales, similar considerations as 
those set out for the NanoTechnology Tools 
segment are applied. Revenue excludes value 
added tax and similar sales-based taxes and is 
stated before commission payable to agents.
(s) Income tax
Income tax on the profit or loss for the year 
comprises current and deferred tax. Income 
tax is recognised in profit or loss except to 
the extent that it relates to items recognised 
directly in equity, in which case it is recognised 
in equity.
Current tax is the expected tax payable on 
the taxable income for the year, using tax 
rates enacted or substantively enacted at the 
reporting date, and any adjustment to tax 
payable in respect of previous years.
Deferred tax is recognised in respect of 
temporary differences between the carrying 
amounts of assets and liabilities for financial 
reporting purposes and the amounts used for 
taxation purposes. The following temporary 
differences are not provided for: the initial 
recognition of goodwill; the initial recognition 
of assets or liabilities that affect neither 
accounting nor taxable profit; and differences 
relating to investments in subsidiaries to the 
extent that they will probably not reverse in 
the future.
The amount of deferred tax provided is based 
on the expected manner of realisation or 
settlement of the carrying amount of assets 
and liabilities, using tax rates enacted or 
substantively enacted at the Statement of 
Financial Position date.
A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the 
extent that it is probable that future taxable 
profits will be available against which the asset 
can be utilised. Deferred tax assets are reduced 
to the extent that it is no longer probable that 
the related tax benefit will be realised.
Additional income taxes that arise from 
the distribution of dividends are recognised 
at the same time as the liability to pay the 
related dividend.
(t) Lease payments
Payments made under operating leases are 
recognised in profit or loss on a straight-line 
basis over the term of the lease. Lease 
incentives received are recognised in the 
Income Statement as an integral part of the 
total lease expense. 01: Strategic Report 02: Governance 03: Financial Statements 04: Company Information
89 Oxford Instruments plc Report and Financial Statements 2017
(u) Segment reporting
An operating segment is a distinguishable 
component of the Group that engages in 
business activities from which it may earn 
revenues and incur expenses, including 
any revenues and expenses that relate 
to transactions with any of the Group’s 
other components. Operating components 
are combined into aggregated operating 
segments to the extent that they have 
similar economic characteristics. Aggregated 
operating segments’ operating results are 
reviewed regularly by the Group’s Board of 
Directors to make decisions about resources 
to be allocated to the segment and to 
assess its performance, for which discrete 
financial information is available. Segment 
results that are reported to the Board include 
items directly attributable to a segment as 
well as those that can be allocated on a 
reasonable basis.
A reportable segment is an aggregated 
operating segment in respect of which 
revenue or profit exceeds 10% of the Group 
total. Discrete financial information is disclosed 
for each reportable segment.
(v) Dividends
Interim and final dividends are recognised 
as a liability when they are no longer at the 
discretion of the Company.
(w) New standards and 
interpretations not yet adopted
A number of new standards, amendments 
to standards and interpretations have been 
issued by the IASB and endorsed by the EU 
and are effective for annual periods beginning 
after 1 April 2016. They have not been applied 
in preparing these consolidated Financial 
Statements. None of these standards are 
expected to have a significant impact on the 
Group Financial Statements.
A number of other new standards, 
amendments to standards and interpretations 
have been issued by the IASB, although they 
are not yet endorsed by the EU, and are 
effective for annual periods beginning after 
1 April 2016. They have not been applied 
in preparing these consolidated Financial 
Statements. The standards which may be 
relevant to the Group are set out below:
• IAS 7 Statement of Cash Flows: which 
becomes mandatory for the Group’s 
consolidated Financial Statements for the 
annual period beginning on 1 April 2017. 
This standard is not expected to have a 
significant impact on the Group Financial 
Statements;
• IAS 12 Income Taxes: which becomes 
mandatory for the Group’s consolidated 
Financial Statements for the annual period 
beginning on 1 April 2017. This standard is 
not expected to have a significant impact 
on the Group Financial Statements;
• IFRS 9 Financial Instruments: which 
becomes mandatory for the Group’s 
consolidated Financial Statements for the 
annual period beginning on 1 April 2018 
and could change the classification and 
measurement of financial assets;
• IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with 
Customers: which becomes mandatory 
for the Group’s consolidated Financial 
Statements for the annual period 
beginning 1 April 2018. The potential 
impact on the Group of the new standard 
is still being assessed; and
• IFRS 16 Leases: which becomes mandatory 
for the Group’s consolidated Financial 
Statements for the annual period 
beginning 1 April 2019. The potential 
impact on the Group of the new standard 
is still being assessed. 90 Oxford Instruments plc Report and Financial Statements 2017

Acquisition related costs comprise professional fees incurred in relation to mergers and acquisitions activity and any consideration which, under 
IFRS 3 (revised), falls to be treated as a post-acquisition employment expense.
Restructuring costs comprise one-off costs in respect of the cost reduction programme which began in March 2015. Restructuring costs relating to 
the Group’s associate relate to exceptional costs incurred by the associate arising from the merger of the Scienta and Omicron businesses. 
During the year the Group settled various claims totalling £0.4m relating to the disposal of its Omicron business in the prior year. In the prior year 
the Group made a loss on disposal of £0.9m in respect of the disposal on Omicron.
In order to assist with comparability between peers, adjusted profit excludes the non-cash amortisation and impairment of acquired intangible 
assets and goodwill and the unwind of discounts in respect of contingent consideration relating to business combinations.
During the year the Group recognised an impairment of £8.0m relating to its equity accounted associate investment. See Note 7 for further details
The one off impairment of capitalised development costs relates to a specific internal systems project that has been stopped as the Group focuses 
and directs resources so as to accelerate key projects.
The one off impairment of capitalised software costs has been carried out following a reassessment of the future value expected to be derived 
from internally developed software.
The Group reports ineffectiveness of its hedging as an adjusting item. In the current year this includes losses on certain contracts relating to 
the hedging of the Japanese Yen which were not required for ordinary trading and which were re-allocated for use against the remittance of 
net income of the Group’s Japan operations. Additionally, under IAS 39, all derivative financial instruments are recognised initially at fair value. 
Subsequent to initial recognition, they are also measured at fair value. In respect of instruments used to hedge foreign exchange risk and interest 
rate risk the Group does not take advantage of the hedge accounting rules provided for in IAS 39 since that standard requires certain stringent 
criteria to be met in order to hedge account, which, in the particular circumstances of the Group, are considered by the Board not to bring 
any significant economic benefit. Accordingly, the Group accounts for these derivative financial instruments at fair value through profit or loss. 
To the extent that instruments are hedges of future transactions, adjusted profit for the year is stated before changes in the valuation of these 
instruments so that the underlying performance of the Group can be more clearly seen. 01: Strategic Report 02: Governance 03: Financial Statements 04: Company Information

In the prior year:
• the reversal of acquisition related fair value adjustments to inventory and property, plant and equipment were excluded from adjusted profit to 
provide a measure that includes results from acquired businesses on a consistent basis over time to assist comparison of performance; and 
• £4.9m was released relating to contingent consideration on the acquisition of Asylum Research Corporation following the end of the 
earnout period.
2 Earnings per share
The calculation of basic and adjusted earnings per share is based on the profit for the year as shown in the Consolidated Statement of Income 
and the adjusted profit for the year as shown in Note 1 respectively. Basic and adjusted earnings are divided by the weighted average number of 
ordinary shares outstanding during the year, excluding shares held by the Employee Share Ownership Trust.

3 Segment information
The Group has seven operating segments. These operating segments have been combined into three aggregated operating segments to the 
extent that they have similar economic characteristics, with relevance to products and services, type and class of customer, methods of sale and 
distribution and the regulatory environment in which they operate. Each of these three aggregated operating segments is a reportable segment.
The Group’s internal management structure and financial reporting systems differentiate the three aggregated operating segments on the basis of 
the economic characteristics discussed below:
• the NanoTechnology Tools segment contains a group of businesses, supplying similar products, characterised by a high degree of customisation 
and high unit prices. These are the Group’s highest technology products serving research customers in both the public and private sectors;
• the Industrial Products segment contains a group of businesses supplying high technology products and components manufactured in medium 
volume for industrial customers; and
• the Service segment contains the Group’s service, rental and refurbished asset sales business as well as service revenues from other parts of the Group.
Reportable segment results include items directly attributable to a segment as well as those which can be allocated on a reasonable basis. 
Inter-segment pricing is determined on an arm’s length basis. The operating results of each are regularly reviewed by the Chief Operating Decision 
Maker, which is deemed to be the Board of Directors. Discrete financial information is available for each segment and used by the Board of 
Directors for decisions on resource allocation and to assess performance. No asset information is presented below as this information is not 
presented in reporting to the Group’s Board of Directors.  98 Oxford Instruments plc Report and Financial Statements 2017

6 Acquisitions – prior period only
Medical Imaging Resources, Inc
On 1 May 2015 the Group acquired 100% of the issued share capital of Medical Imaging Resources, Inc (“MIR”) for a net cash consideration of 
£8.7m. Further contingent consideration of up to £6.3m was payable based on the performance of the Oxford Instruments Healthcare business in 
the year to 31 March 2016. MIR specialises in the build, lease, service and sale of mobile medical imaging labs. 
The book and fair values of the assets and liabilities acquired are given in the table below. Fair value adjustments have been made to better align 
the accounting policies of the acquired business with the Group accounting policies and to reflect the fair value of assets and liabilities acquired. 
The business was acquired for the purpose of integrating into the Oxford Instruments Healthcare business where it was believed that a number 
of synergies could be obtained.

The goodwill arising is not tax deductible and is considered to represent the value of the acquired workforce and synergistic benefits expected to 
arise from the acquisition. No deferred tax liability was recognised relating to the fair value of acquired intangibles due to the Company making a 
Section 338 election in the USA to treat this acquisition as a trade and assets purchase for tax purposes.  01: Strategic Report 02: Governance 03: Financial Statements 04: Company Information
101 Oxford Instruments plc Report and Financial Statements 2017
Contingent consideration of £6.5m was paid during May 2016 based on the performance of the Oxford Instruments Healthcare business in the 
year to 31 March 2016. The difference of £0.2m between contingent consideration provided at acquisition and that paid in May 2016 was due 
to foreign currency movements.
The book value of receivables in the tables above represents the gross contractual amounts receivable. 
7 Investment in associate
During the prior year the Group entered into a strategic alliance with GD Intressenter AB of Sweden (“GDI”) to create the world’s largest company 
in the highly specialised ultra high vacuum surface science field. The alliance comprised Oxford Instruments’ Omicron Nanotechnology GmbH 
(“Omicron”) and associated subsidiaries and GDI’s Scienta Scientific AB (“Scienta”) and associated subsidiaries. Scienta Scientific AB is registered 
and has its principal place of business in Sweden. 
In consideration for new shares in Scienta, Oxford Instruments transferred all of its shares in the capital of Omicron to Scienta. Oxford Instruments 
holds a 47% interest in the ordinary share capital of Scienta and GDI holds 53%. The investment has been accounted for as an associate taking 
into account the following factors:
• the Group holds substantial, but minority, voting rights (47%). All other rights are controlled by a single shareholder;
• the Group has a minority number of Non-Executive Board seats (two of five), with the remaining seats held by representatives of GDI; and
• whilst the Group has certain veto rights in respect of certain decisions, it cannot unilaterally direct the activities of the Scienta Group.
The book value of the net assets disposed of was £14.9m. The value of the shareholding acquired in Scienta was considered to be £14.6m and as 
a result an £0.3m loss on disposal arose on the transaction in 2015/16.
During the current year the Group:
• settled various claims totalling £0.4m relating to the disposal of its Omicron business in the prior year.; and
• recognised an impairment charge of £8.0m in respect of its investment in Scienta.
The Group’s share of loss in its equity accounted associate for the year was £1.2m (2016: £1.5m). The Group did not receive any dividends from 
the associate in either period.

During the year the Group recognised an impairment charge of £8.0m relating to its investment in ScientaOmicron due to the associate’s financial 
performance for the year ended 31 December 2016 and lower projected cash flows. This resulted in a reassessment of ScientaOmicron’s expected 
future business performance and the actions and time required to improve profitability and operational efficiency.
The £8.0m impairment has been reported in the results of the NanoTechnology Tools segment. As at 31 March 2017, the estimate of the 
recoverable amount of the Group’s investment in ScientaOmicron, being its value in use, was calculated as £3.9m. The pre-tax discount rate 
used to arrive at this estimate was 15.5%.

According to the terms of the transaction, no dividend could be paid by the associate until 27 May 2017. Following that date, any dividend paid 
must be agreed by both Oxford Instruments plc and GD Intressenter AB, up to a maximum of 50% of the previous year’s profit after tax. At the 
date of signing these Financial Statements no dividend has been declared or paid. 102 Oxford Instruments plc Report and Financial Statements 2017

Discontinued operations
In the year to 31 March 2017 the Group’s Superconducting Wire business was classified as a discontinued operation; and in the year to 
31 March 2016 the Group’s Austin Scientific business was classified as a discontinued operation. They were considered major classes of business 
on the basis that they were previously operating segments and referred to in the Group Strategic Report. 
The 2016 Financial Statements have been re-presented to reflect the classification of the Group’s Superconducting Wire business as a 
discontinued operation.

13 Share option schemes
The Group operates three share option schemes:
All employee Share Incentive Plan (“SIP”)
All UK employees are eligible to participate in the Group’s HM Revenue and Customs approved SIP . Participating employees make a cash 
contribution to the plan each month. The Group contributes a further amount equal to 20% of the employee’s contribution. Independent trustees 
then purchase matching shares in the market on behalf of the employees. The matching shares vest on the completion by the participating 
employee of a further three years’ service and can be withdrawn from the plan tax-free after five years’ service.
Executive Share Option Scheme (“ESO”)
Options awarded under the Executive Share Option Scheme are made annually to certain senior managers. The exercise prices are determined 
according to the mid-market closing share price on the day before the date of grant. Options have a life of ten years and a vesting period of 
three years. 
Senior Executive Long Term Incentive Scheme (“SELTIS”)
Options awarded under the Senior Executive Long Term Incentive Scheme are made annually to certain senior managers. The exercise prices are nil. 
Options have a life of seven years and a vesting period of three years.
Both the Executive Share Option Scheme and Senior Executive Long Term Incentive Scheme are subject to performance conditions which can be 
found in the Remuneration Report on pages 60 to 75.
Performance Share Plan Scheme (“PSP”)
Under the Performance Share Plan awards of performance shares (or nil-cost options) are made annually to certain senior managers. Awards have 
a life of ten years with vesting subject to achievement of performance targets and a vesting period of a minimum of three years (but may be up to 
five years).
Administrative expenses include a charge of £0.5m (2016: £0.4m) in respect of the cost of providing share-based remuneration. The cost of share 
options is calculated by estimating the fair value of the option at grant date and spreading that amount over the vesting period after adjusting for 
an expectation of non-vesting.
Fair values are determined using an internal valuation model based on a modified Black-Scholes model. Expected volatility has been based on 
historical volatility over a period of time of the same length as the expected option life and ending on the grant date. Half of the ESO options 
issued before 2009, half of the PSP options and all SELTIS options use total shareholder return (“TSR”) as a performance condition. As TSR is a 
market-based performance condition, the accounting treatment differs from that for options subject to non-market performance conditions. This 
means that the TSR performance conditions have been incorporated into the calculation of the fair value as a discount in calculating the fair value.
For options granted in the years ended 31 March 2017 and 2016, the fair value per option granted and the assumptions used in the calculation 
are as follows:

A reduction in the UK corporation tax rate from 21% to 20% (effective from 1 April 2015) was substantively enacted on 2 July 2013. Further 
reductions to 19% (effective from 1 April 2017) and to 18% (effective from 1 April 2020) were substantively enacted on 26 October 2015, and 
an additional reduction to 17% (effective from 1 April 2020) was substantively enacted on 6 September 2016. This will reduce the Company’s 
future current tax charge accordingly. The UK deferred tax liability at 31 March 2017 has been calculated based on those rates. The Group carries 
tax provisions in relation to uncertain tax provisions arising from the possible outcome of negotiations with tax authorities. Such provisions are a 
reflection of the geographical spread of the Group’s operations and the variety of jurisdictions in which it carries out its activities.

Goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated, at acquisition, to the cash generating units (“CGUs”) that are expected to benefit from 
that business combination. The carrying amount of goodwill was allocated to individual CGUs as follows:

The Group tests goodwill annually for impairment, or more frequently if there are indications that goodwill might be impaired.
Accounting standards require an impairment test to be carried out by determining the recoverable amount of each CGU which contains goodwill. 
The recoverable amount is calculated as the higher of the fair value less costs to sell or the value in use of the CGU. In the Group’s case the 
recoverable amount is based on value in use calculations. Value in use is calculated by discounting expected future cash flows and in particular 
(except as noted below) Board-approved five year cash flow forecasts, prepared by the management of each CGU, are used together with 3% per 
annum growth for the subsequent 20 years. These rates are considered to be at or below long-term market trends for the Group’s businesses.
During the year the Group made impairments in respect of intangible assets as follows:
• £22.6m in respect of the Goodwill of the Asylum CGU;
• £6.2m in respect of the Goodwill of the OI Healthcare CGU;
• £5.0m in respect of Customer Relationships which arose on the acquisition of MIR in 2015;
• £2.2m in respect of bespoke software development;
• £1.1m in respect of a technology related acquired intangible which was superseded by a new product; and
• £0.7m in respect of a development project which was stopped in order to allow the Group to focus and direct resources so as to accelerate 
key projects.
During the year the financial performance of the Group’s Asylum CGU deteriorated with the business performing below expectations. Performance 
has been impacted by a slowdown in academic funding in US and European markets, resulting in a contraction of the overall scanning probe 
microscopy market, compounded by delays in new product launches. The Group has revised its financial projections for the business and planned 
launch dates for new products in light of the trading environment.
The financial performance of the Group’s Healthcare business also deteriorated in the US during the year, with business operating profit falling 
significantly from last year’s level. Performance has been impacted by a lower level of sales of refurbished imaging systems compared to the 
previous year, which is expected to continue. This has been driven by both a particularly high level of activity in the prior year but also a change 
in software licensing policy by one of the large original equipment manufacturers. The Group has revised its financial projections for the business, 
consistent with a new strategy and the actions and time required to improve profitability and operational efficiency.
The Asylum and OI Healthcare CGUs are business operations and the goodwill and acquired intangible assets relating to each are held in the 
NanoTechnology Tools and Service segments respectively. As at 31 March 2017, the estimates of the recoverable amounts of the Asylum and 
OI Healthcare CGUs, being their value in use, were calculated as £16.0m and £9.0m respectively. The discount rates used in arriving at these 
estimates were 13.2% for Asylum and 15.5% for OI Healthcare.
In respect of the impairment tests for Asylum and OI Healthcare, specific forecasts were prepared for the purpose of the impairment test taking 
into account the latest available information regarding business and market conditions. 
The £2.2m impairment of software costs represents inefficient capitalised costs relating to the Group’s new ERP system and has been reported as 
part of unallocated central costs in the segmental disclosure. The £1.1m impairment of technology related acquired intangible assets represents 
the write down of intellectual property obtained as part of a previous acquisition that has since been superseded by a new product. The asset 
belonged to the Industrial Products segment.
The £0.7m impairment of capitalised development costs arose as a result of the termination of a specific project that was stopped in order to focus 
and direct resources so as to accelerate key projects. The impaired capitalised development costs were held in the NanoTechnology Tools segment. 110 Oxford Instruments plc Report and Financial Statements 2017

Key assumptions
The key assumptions are those regarding discount rates, growth rates, expected selling volumes and prices and direct costs during the period.
The growth rates are based on industry growth factors. Changes in selling prices and direct costs are based on past practices and expectations of 
future changes in the market.
The pre-tax weighted average costs of capital used for NanoTechnology Tools, Industrial Products and Service in impairment testing are  
12.8%-13.6% (2016: 12.1%-12.9%), 12.4%-13.1% (2016: 13.0%-13.4%) and 15.5% (2016: 13.3%) respectively in line with the risk associated 
with each of the business segments. Management have estimated these discount rates by reference to past experience and an industry average 
weighted cost of capital as adjusted for appropriate risk factors reflecting current economic circumstances and the risk profiles of each CGU.
Sensitivity analysis
Since impairments have been made in respect of the Asylum and OI Healthcare CGUs, any further adverse change in assumptions would result 
in a further impairment to the remaining acquired intangible assets held by these two CGUs. There is no remaining goodwill allocated to these 
businesses. A sensitivity analysis has been performed in respect of the other CGUs as follows.
The Group’s estimate of impairments is most sensitive to changes in the discount rate and forecast growth rate. Sensitivity analysis has been carried 
out by reference to both of these assumptions and demonstrated that large headroom remained across the businesses even after significant

Deductible temporary differences       1.7 1.0
Tax losses        9.8 9.1

The tax losses and the deductible temporary differences do not expire under current tax legislation. Deferred tax assets have not been recognised 
in respect of these items as it is not probable that future taxable profits will be available in the subsidiaries concerned against which the Group can 
utilise the brought forward tax losses.
No deferred tax liability has been recognised in respect of £25.7m (2016: £33.1m) of undistributed earnings of overseas subsidiaries since the 
majority of such distributions would not be taxable. In other cases the Group considers that it is able to control the timing of remittances so that 
any tax is not expected to arise in the foreseeable future.

The amount of inventory recognised as an expense was £147.1m (2016: £143.6m). In the ordinary course of business, the Group makes 
impairment provisions for slow-moving, excess and obsolete inventory as appropriate. Inventory is stated after charging impairments of £0.4m 
in the current period (2016: £1.9m). In the current year, £0.2m (2016: £0.2m) was reversed relating to previous impairments. Impairments are 
included within gross profit.
Inventory carried at fair value less costs to sell is £nil (2016: £nil).

22 Financial risk management
The Group’s multinational operations and debt financing expose it to a variety of financial risks. In the course of its business, the Group is exposed 
to foreign currency risk, interest rate risk, liquidity risk, commodity risk and credit risk. Financial risk management policies are set by the Board of 
Directors. These policies are implemented by a central treasury function that has formal procedures to manage foreign exchange risk, interest rate 
risk and liquidity risk, including, where appropriate, the use of derivative financial instruments. Commodity risk is managed locally by the operating 
businesses. The Group has clearly defined authority and approval limits.
In accordance with its treasury policy, the Group does not hold or use derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. 
Such instruments are only used to manage the risks arising from operating or financial assets or liabilities or highly probable future transactions.
The Group uses derivative financial instruments to hedge its exposure to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, interest rates and certain 
commodity prices.
The Group has adopted hedge accounting for a limited number of related commodity contracts as outlined below. However, in common with a 
number of other companies, the Group has decided that the additional costs of meeting the extensive documentation requirements of IAS 39 to 
apply hedge accounting to derivative financial instruments used for hedging exposure to foreign currency and interest rate volatility cannot be 
justified. Accordingly, the Group does not use hedge accounting for such derivatives.
Foreign currency risk
Foreign currency risk arises both where sale or purchase transactions are undertaken in currencies other than the respective functional currencies 
of Group companies (transactional exposures) and where the results of overseas companies are consolidated into the Group’s reporting currency 
of Sterling (translational exposures). The Group has operations around the world which record their results in a variety of different local functional 
currencies. In countries where the Group does not have operations, it invariably has some customers or suppliers that transact in a foreign currency. 
The Group is therefore exposed to the changes in foreign currency exchange rates between a number of different currencies but the Group’s 
primary exposures relate to the US Dollar, the Euro and the Japanese Yen. To reduce uncertainty, the Group maintains a rolling hedge of forward 
contracts equivalent of to 75% (2016: 80%) of the exposure expected to arise over the following twelve months. The remaining 25% is sold on 
the spot market. The fair value of outstanding currency contracts recognised as a liability as at 31 March 2017 amount to £5.0m (2016: £5.8m) 
and those recognised as an asset amount to £0.6m (2016: £1.5m). 01: Strategic Report 02: Governance 03: Financial Statements 04: Company Information
113 Oxford Instruments plc Report and Financial Statements 2017
Movements in the fair value of derivative financial instruments are recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Income immediately. However, in 
order to facilitate a more meaningful comparison of the Group’s performance year on year the element of these movements that relate to hedges 
in respect of future sales are treated as an adjusting item in the calculation of adjusted earnings (Note 1).
The Group’s translational exposures to foreign currency risks can relate both to the Consolidated Statement of Income and net assets of overseas 
subsidiaries. The Group’s policy is not to hedge the translational exposure that arises on consolidation of the Consolidated Statements of Income of 
overseas subsidiaries. 
Interest rate risk
Interest rate risk comprises both the interest rate price risk that results from borrowing at fixed rates of interest and also the interest cash flow 
risk that results from borrowing at variable rates. The Group’s policy is to use a mixture of revolving short- and medium-term floating rate debt 
underpinned by longer-term fixed rate debt. The short- and medium-term floating rate debt provides flexibility to reduce debt levels as appropriate. 
The longer-term fixed rate debt provides stability and cost certainty to the Group’s financing structure. 
Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk represents the risk that the Group will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due. The Group’s approach to managing 
this risk is to ensure, as far as possible, that it will always have sufficient liquidity to meet its liabilities when due, under both normal and stressed 
conditions, without incurring unacceptable losses or risking damage to the Group’s reputation. The Group manages this risk by maintaining 
adequate committed lines of funding from high quality lenders. The facilities committed to the Group as at 31 March 2017 are set out in Note 25.
Credit risk
Credit risk arises because a counterparty may fail to perform its obligations. The Group is exposed to credit risk on financial assets such as cash 
balances, derivative financial instruments, trade and other receivables. The Group’s credit risk is primarily attributable to its trade receivables 
and cash balances. The amounts recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position are net of appropriate allowances for doubtful 
receivables, estimated by the Group’s management based on prior experience and their assessment of the current economic environment. Trade 
receivables are subject to credit limits and control and approval procedures in the operating companies.
Due to its large geographic base and number of customers, the Group is not exposed to material concentrations of credit risk on its trade 
receivables. Credit risk associated with cash balances and derivative financial instruments is managed by transacting with financial institutions 
with high quality credit ratings. In particular, a Board-approved policy sets out guidelines for which categories of institutions may be used and 
the maximum amount which may be invested with each institution within a particular category. Accordingly, the Group’s associated credit risk 
is limited. The Group has no significant concentration of credit risk. The Group’s maximum exposure to credit risk is represented by the carrying 
amount of each financial asset, including derivative financial instruments, in the Group Consolidated Statement of Financial Position.
Exposure to credit risk
The carrying amount of financial assets represents the maximum credit exposure. The maximum exposure to credit risk at 31 March 2017 was 
£109.6m (2016: £99.9m).

Forward exchange contracts       0.6 1.5
        109.6 99.9
The maximum exposure to credit risk for trade receivables is discussed in Note 20.
Other receivables include £2.8m (2016: £3.1m) in respect of VAT and similar taxes which are not past due date.
Commodity risk
The Group was exposed to changes in commodity prices, particularly in respect of copper used as a major component in one of the Group’s USA 
operations. It managed this exposure using derivative commodity hedging instruments.
At 31 March 2017, the Group had outstanding commodity hedge contracts with a fair value liability of £nil (2016: £0.1m fair value liability) 
that were designated and effective as cash flow hedges of committed and highly probable forecast transactions. Fair value movements of these 
contracts have been deferred in equity until the hedged transaction takes place. There are no contracts held as at the date of the Consolidated 
Statement of Financial Position.
A £nil loss net of tax (2016: £0.1m net loss) has been deferred in equity as at 31 March 2017 in respect of these contracts. A gain of £0.1m 
(2015: £0.2m gain) has been recycled to current assets (inventory) in respect of contracts designated as cash flow hedges that have matured 
during the year to 31 March 2017. 114 Oxford Instruments plc Report and Financial Statements 2017

Capital management
The Board considers capital to comprise share capital, reserves and the net cash or net debt position of the Company. The Company was in a net 
debt position at the year end. Total capital at the end of the current year totalled £241.8m (2016: £271.2m). 
The Board’s long-term objective is to have an efficient capital structure by maintaining a balance between the higher returns that might be possible 
with higher levels of borrowings and the advantages and security afforded by a sound capital position. This is monitored by reference to the ratio 
of net debt to earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (“EBITDA”) and the Board has set itself internal limits, which are well 
inside any covenants the Group has with lenders. The Group maintains the right to purchase its own shares in the market; the timing of these 
purchases would depend on market prices. Buy and sell decisions are made on a specific transaction basis by the Board.
The Board carefully considers dividend payments and the Company moved from a fixed dividend policy to a progressive one in the year ended 
March 2011. In doing this, the Board will look to increase dividends as adjusted earnings per share increase although there will not be a direct 
correlation. The Board does not have a policy to pay a fixed dividend yield or to maintain a fixed rate of dividend cover, but assess both of these 
metrics together with dividends paid by peers when assessing what dividend to recommend.
As set out in the Chief Executive’s Statement, the Group will actively manage its portfolio of businesses and products, selecting those markets 
with long term growth drivers where we can maintain or grow leading positions. We will focus on those markets where nanotechnology has the 
potential to address some of the world’s most complex and pressing challenges and where we can deliver unique solutions and service excellence. 
In line with the objective of maintaining a balance between borrowings and equity, the Group would seek to finance organic growth (e.g. through 
investment in Research and Development) and smaller “bolt-on” acquisitions from operating cash flow thus maintaining balance sheet efficiency. 
Larger acquisitions would be financed either by equity or a mixture of equity and debt so as to ensure the Group has a manageable ratio of net 
debt to EBITDA.
The Board encourages employees to hold shares in the Company. As well as various share option plans (full details of which are given in Note 13), 
from April 2008 all UK employees have been offered the opportunity to take part in a Share Incentive Plan (“SIP”). Under this plan, employees are 
able to invest up to £1,500 each tax year in shares in the Company. The Company awards one additional free share (a matching share) for every 
five shares bought by each employee.
There were no changes to the Group’s approach to capital management during the year. Neither the Company nor any of its subsidiaries 
are subject to externally imposed capital requirements.

The following summarises the major methods and assumptions used in estimating the fair values of financial instruments reflected in the 
above table.
Derivative financial instruments
Derivative financial instruments are marked to market using market prices.
Fixed and floating rate borrowings
The fair value of fixed and floating rate borrowings is estimated by discounting the future contracted principal and interest cash flows using the 
market rate of interest at the reporting date.
Trade and other receivables/payables
For receivables/payables with a remaining life of less than one year, the carrying amount is deemed to reflect the fair value. All other receivables/
payables are discounted to determine their fair value. Advances received are excluded from other payables above as these are not considered to be 
financial liabilities.
Contingent consideration
The fair value of contingent consideration is estimated based on the forecast future performance of the acquired business over a timeframe 
determined as part of the acquisition agreement, discounted as appropriate. Key assumptions include growth rates, expected selling volumes and 
prices and direct costs during the period.
Fair value hierarchy 
The table above gives details of the valuation method used in arriving at the fair value of financial instruments. The different levels have been 
identified as follows:
• Level 1: quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets and liabilities;
• Level 2: inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly 
(i.e. derived from prices); and
• Level 3: inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data. 
There have been no transfers between levels during the year.

Sensitivity analysis
The Group has estimated the impact on the Consolidated Statement of Income and on Equity of the following changes in market conditions at the 
balance sheet date:
• one percentage point increase in interest rates;
• ten percentage point weakening in the value of Sterling against all currencies; and
• ten percentage point strengthening in the value of Sterling against all currencies.
The sensitivities above represent the Directors’ view of reasonably possible changes in each risk variable, not worst case scenarios or stress tests. 
The outputs from the sensitivity analysis are estimates of the impact of market risk assuming that the specified changes occur at the year end and 
are applied to the risk exposures at that date. Accordingly, they show the impact on the balance sheet of an instantaneous shock. The calculations 
include all hedges in place at the year end.
Actual results in the future may differ materially from these estimates due to commercial actions taken to mitigate any potential losses from such 
rate movements, to the interaction of more than one sensitivity occurring and to further developments in global financial markets. As such, this 
table should not be considered as a projection of likely future gains and losses.

The Group has agreed a basis for deficit recovery payments with the trustees of the UK pension scheme. The annual deficit recovery payment 
to the UK scheme was £6.9m (2016: £6.8m) for the financial year, payable through to and including 2021. For the years up to and including 
2018, the payment will rise by the higher of inflation and growth in dividend per share; thereafter, the payment will increase in line with inflation. 
The weighted average durations of the UK and US defined benefit obligations at 31 March 2017 were 19 years and 16 years respectively 
(2016: 20 years and 16 years).
The Group has considered the requirements of IFRIC14 and concluded that there is no impact on the amounts recognised in respect of retirement 
benefit obligations.
The Group expects to contribute approximately £7.6m to defined benefit plans in the next financial year.
The pension costs are recorded in the following lines of the Consolidated Statement of Income:

Sensitivity analysis
The table below shows the sensitivity of the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position to changes in the significant pension assumptions:
      Balance at  Discount rate Inflation rate Life expectancy 
      31 March 2017 (-0.1% p.a.) (+0.1% p.a.) (+one year)

Deficit      25.1 30.8 30.7 37.3
The valuation of defined benefit liabilities is most sensitive to changes in the discount rate, inflation rate and mortality rate. The sensitivities have 
been calculated by running the liability calculations in full using the alternative assumptions. In each case, only the indicated assumption has 
changed by the amount stated. For the inflation sensitivity, the impact on the assumptions that are based on RPI inflation, such as CPI inflation 
and the inflation-linked pension increases, has been included. 01: Strategic Report 02: Governance 03: Financial Statements 04: Company Information

Warranty provisions
Product warranty provisions reflect commitments made to customers on the sale of goods in the ordinary course of business and included within 
the Group companies’ standard terms and conditions. Warranty commitments typically apply for a twelve-month period. The provision represents 
the Directors’ best estimate of the Group’s liability based on past experience.
Restructuring provision
The Restructuring provision relates to amounts provided as a result of the cost reduction programme initiated during 2015/16. The remaining 
provision relates principally to onerous leases arising as a result of the restructuring programme. The provision represents the Directors’ best 
estimate of the liability arising. The Directors believe these amounts may have to be settled within the next twelve months. 
Other provisions
Other provisions relate to various obligations including obligations in respect of onerous leases, obligations to employees in Japan on termination 
of their employment and claims and disputes such as intellectual property claims arising against the Group in the ordinary course of business. 
The Company has on occasion been required to take legal or other actions to defend itself against proceedings brought by other parties. Provisions 
are made for the expected costs associated with such matters, based on past experience of similar items and other known factors, taking into 
account professional advice received, and represent the Directors’ best estimate of the likely outcome. The timing of utilisation of these provisions 
is frequently uncertain reflecting the complexity of issues and the outcome of various court proceedings and negotiations. Contractual and 
other provisions represent the Directors’ best estimate of the cost of settling future obligations and reflect the Directors’ assessment of the likely 
settlement method, which may change over time. However, no provision is made for proceedings which have been, or might be brought by other 
parties against Group companies unless the Directors, taking into account professional advice received, assesses that it is more likely than not that 
such proceedings may be successful. The Group’s expectation is that the other provisions are likely to be utilised within a twelve-month period. 
29 Operating leases
Leases
Non-cancellable future total minimum operating lease rentals are payable as follows:

During the year ended 31 March 2017, £4.5m was recognised as an expense in the Consolidated Statement of Income in respect of operating 
leases (2016: £3.0m). 
The majority of operating leases relate to properties occupied by the Group in the course of its business. There are no material contingent rent 
payment arrangements, purchase options or escalation clauses. It is expected that most leases could be renewed on the existing or similar terms. 
The leases do not impose any material restrictions in respect of dividends, additional debt requirements or further leasing. 122 Oxford Instruments plc Report and Financial Statements 2017

Total        1.6 1.7
Short-term employee benefits comprise salary and benefits earned during the year and bonuses awarded for the year.
The share-based payment credit of £0.2m (2016: £nil) arose due to the reversal of the share option charge relating to options previously issued to 
Jonathan Flint.
During the year the Company paid £0.1m (2016: £0.2m) to Imperialise Limited, a company for which Nigel Keen is a Director. The payment was 
for his services as Chairman of the Group. The liability due to Imperialise Limited at the year end was £nil (2016: £nil).
During the year, the Group supplied services and materials to, and purchased services and materials from, its associate on an arm’s length basis.

33 Subsequent events
The interim dividend of 3.7p per share (total cost £2.1m) was paid after the year end. In addition on 13 June 2017, the Directors proposed a 
final dividend of 9.3p per ordinary share (total cost £5.3m). The total amount of £5.3m has not been provided for and there are no income tax 
consequences.
On 26 April 2017, the Group announced that it had agreed to sell its Industrial Analysis business to Hitachi High-Technologies Corporation (“HHT”) 
for a consideration of £80m on a cash and debt-free basis. HHT will acquire the companies, assets and liabilities that comprise the Industrial 
Analysis business.
The transaction is expected to close in the second quarter of the 2017/18 financial year. Proceeds will be used to reduce existing borrowings. 
The current Industrial Analysis management team will transfer with the business. 01: Strategic Report 02: Governance 03: Financial Statements 04: Company Information

Notes to the Parent Company Financial Statements
year ended 31 March 2017
(a) Accounting policies
Oxford Instruments plc is a company 
incorporated and domiciled in the UK. 
These Financial Statements were prepared 
in accordance with Financial Reporting 
Standard 101 Reduced Disclosure Framework 
(“FRS 101”). The amendments to FRS 101 
(2013/14 Cycle) issued in July 2015 and 
effective immediately have been applied.
In preparing these Financial Statements, 
the Company applies the recognition, 
measurement and disclosure requirements of 
International Financial Reporting Standards 
as adopted by the EU (“Adopted IFRS”), 
but makes amendments where necessary in 
order to comply with Companies Act 2006 
and has set out below where advantage 
of the FRS 101 disclosure exemptions has 
been taken. 
In these Financial Statements, the Company 
has applied the exemptions available under 
FRS 101 in respect of the following disclosures: 
• a Cash Flow Statement and related notes; 
• comparative period reconciliations for share 
capital, tangible fixed assets, intangible 
assets and investment properties; 
• disclosures in respect of transactions with 
wholly owned subsidiaries; 
• disclosures in respect of capital 
management; 
• the effects of new but not yet effective 
IFRS; and 
• disclosures in respect of the compensation 
of key management personnel. 
As the consolidated Financial Statements of 
Oxford Instruments plc include the equivalent 
disclosures, the Company has also taken the 
exemptions under FRS 101 available in respect 
of the following disclosures:
• IFRS 2 Share-based Payments in respect of 
Group settled share-based payments;
• certain disclosures required by IAS 36 
Impairment of Assets in respect of the 
impairment of goodwill and indefinite life 
intangible assets; and
• certain disclosures required by IFRS 
13 Fair Value Measurement and the 
disclosures required by IFRS 7 Financial 
Instrument Disclosures.
The accounting policies set out below 
have, unless otherwise stated, been applied 
consistently to all periods presented in these 
Financial Statements.
Measurement convention
The Financial Statements are prepared on the 
historical cost basis except that the following 
assets and liabilities are stated at their fair 
value: derivative financial instruments.
Going concern
The Financial Statements have been prepared 
on a going concern basis, based on the 
Directors’ opinion, after making reasonable 
enquiries, that the Company has adequate 
resources to continue in operational existence 
for the foreseeable future.
Taxation
Income tax on the profit or loss for the year 
comprises current and deferred tax. Income 
tax is recognised in profit or loss except to 
the extent that it relates to items recognised 
directly in equity, in which case it is recognised 
in equity.
Current tax is the expected tax payable on 
the taxable income for the year, using tax 
rates enacted or substantively enacted at the 
reporting date, and any adjustment to tax 
payable in respect of previous years.
Deferred tax is recognised in respect of 
temporary differences between the carrying 
amounts of assets and liabilities for financial 
reporting purposes and the amounts used for 
taxation purposes. The following temporary 
differences are not provided for: the initial 
recognition of goodwill; the initial recognition 
of assets or liabilities that affect neither 
accounting nor taxable profit; and differences 
relating to investments in subsidiaries to the 
extent that they will probably not reverse in 
the future.
The amount of deferred tax provided is 
based on the expected manner of realisation 
or settlement of the carrying amount of 
assets and liabilities, using tax rates enacted 
or substantively enacted at the Balance 
Sheet date.
A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the 
extent that it is probable that future taxable 
profits will be available against which the asset 
can be utilised. Deferred tax assets are reduced 
to the extent that it is no longer probable that 
the related tax benefit will be realised.
Additional income taxes that arise from 
the distribution of dividends are recognised 
at the same time as the liability to pay the 
related dividend.
Non-derivative financial instruments
Non-derivative financial instruments comprise 
trade and other debtors, cash and cash 
equivalents, loans and borrowings, and trade 
and other creditors.
Trade and other debtors 
Trade and other debtors are recognised initially 
at fair value. Subsequent to initial recognition 
they are measured at amortised cost using 
the effective interest method, less any 
impairment losses.
Trade and other creditors 
Trade and other creditors are recognised 
initially at fair value. Subsequent to initial 
recognition they are measured at amortised 
cost using the effective interest method.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash 
balances and call deposits. 
Interest-bearing borrowings
Interest-bearing borrowings are recognised 
initially at fair value less attributable 
transaction costs. Subsequent to initial 
recognition, interest-bearing borrowings are 
stated at amortised cost using the effective 
interest method, less any impairment losses. 
Details of the Group’s interest-bearing 
borrowings are included in Note 25 to the 
Group Financial Statements.
Intra-Group lending
The Company has lent funds to and from its 
UK subsidiaries on interest-free terms. These 
amounts are repayable on demand. They are 
stated at cost less any impairment losses.
Derivative financial instruments
The Company’s accounting policies for 
financial instruments are the same as the 
Group’s accounting policies under IFRS, 
namely IAS 32 Financial Instruments: 
Presentation, IAS 39 Financial Instruments: 
Recognition and Measurement and 
IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures. 
These policies are set out in accounting policy 
“(e) Financial instruments” in the Group 
accounting policies, on pages 85 and 86. 
Tangible fixed assets
Tangible fixed assets are stated at cost less 
accumulated depreciation and accumulated 
impairment losses.
Where parts of an item of tangible fixed assets 
have different useful lives, they are accounted 
for as separate items of tangible fixed assets. 01: Strategic Report 02: Governance 03: Financial Statements 04: Company Information
127 Oxford Instruments plc Report and Financial Statements 2017
Depreciation is charged to the profit and 
loss account on a straight-line basis over the 
estimated useful lives of each part of an item 
of tangible fixed assets. The estimated useful 
lives are as follows:
• Computer equipment 4 years
• Motor vehicles  4 years
Depreciation methods, useful lives and 
residual values are reviewed at each balance 
sheet date. 
Intangible assets 
Intangible assets represents internally 
developed software. Amortisation is 
charged to the profit and loss account on a 
straight-line basis over the estimated useful 
lives of intangible assets unless such lives are 
indefinite. Intangible assets are amortised 
from the date they are available for use. 
The estimated useful lives are as follows:
• Computer software 10 years
Impairment excluding  
deferred tax assets
Financial assets (including  
trade and other debtors)
The Company assesses at each Balance Sheet 
reporting date whether there is any objective 
evidence that a financial asset, or group of 
financial assets, is impaired. A financial asset, 
or group of financial assets, is deemed to 
be impaired if, and only if, there is objective 
evidence of impairment as a result of one 
or more events that have occurred after the 
initial recognition of the asset (an incurred 
“loss event”) and that loss event has an 
impact on the estimated future cash flows of 
the financial asset or group of financial assets 
that can be reliably estimated.
Non-financial assets
The carrying amounts of the Company’s 
non-financial assets, other than deferred tax 
assets, are reviewed at each reporting date to 
determine whether there is any indication of 
impairment. If any such indication exists, then 
the asset’s recoverable amount is estimated. 
The recoverable amount of an asset or cash 
generating unit is the greater of its value 
in use and its fair value less costs to sell. In 
assessing value in use, the estimated future 
cash flows are discounted to their present 
value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects 
current market assessments of the time value 
of money and the risks specific to the asset. 
For the purpose of impairment testing, assets 
that cannot be tested individually are grouped 
together into the smallest group of assets 
that generates cash inflows from continuing 
use that are largely independent of the cash 
inflows of other assets or groups of assets (the 
“cash generating unit” or “CGU”).
An impairment loss is recognised if the 
carrying amount of an asset or its CGU 
exceeds its estimated recoverable amount. 
Impairment losses are recognised in profit or 
loss. Impairment losses recognised in respect 
of CGUs are allocated first to reduce the 
carrying amount of any goodwill allocated 
to the units, and then to reduce the carrying 
amounts of the other assets in the unit (group 
of units) on a pro-rata basis. 
Impairment losses recognised in prior periods 
are assessed at each reporting date for any 
indications that the loss has decreased or no 
longer exists. An impairment loss is reversed 
if there has been a change in the estimates 
used to determine the recoverable amount. 
An impairment loss is reversed only to the 
extent that the asset’s carrying amount does 
not exceed the carrying amount that would 
have been determined, net of depreciation 
or amortisation, if no impairment loss had 
been recognised.
Employee benefits
Defined contribution plans
A defined contribution plan is a 
post-employment benefit plan under which 
the Company pays fixed contributions into 
a separate entity and will have no legal 
or constructive obligation to pay further 
amounts. Obligations for contributions 
to defined contribution pension plans are 
recognised as an expense in the profit and loss 
account in the periods during which services 
are rendered by employees.
Defined benefit plans
A defined benefit plan is a post-employment 
benefit plan other than a defined contribution 
plan. The Company’s net obligation in respect 
of defined benefit pension plans is calculated 
by estimating the amount of future benefit 
that employees have earned in return for 
their service in the current and prior periods; 
that benefit is discounted to determine 
its present value, and the fair value of any 
plan assets (at bid price) are deducted. The 
Company determines the net interest on the 
net defined benefit liability/(asset) for the 
period by applying the discount rate used to 
measure the defined benefit obligation at the 
beginning of the annual period to the net 
defined benefit liability/(asset).
The discount rate is the yield at the reporting 
date on bonds that have a credit rating 
of at least AA that have maturity dates 
approximating the terms of the Company’s 
obligations and that are denominated in the 
currency in which the benefits are expected to 
be paid.
Remeasurements arising from defined benefit 
plans comprise actuarial gains and losses, the 
return on plan assets (excluding interest) and 
the effect of the asset ceiling (if any, excluding 
interest). The Company recognises them 
immediately in other comprehensive income 
and all other expenses related to defined 
benefit plans in employee benefit expenses 
in profit or loss.
The calculation of the defined benefit 
obligations is performed by a qualified actuary 
using the projected unit credit method. 
When the calculation results in a benefit to 
the Company, the recognised asset is limited 
to the present value of benefits available in 
the form of any future refunds from the plan 
or reductions in future contributions and 
takes into account the adverse effect of any 
minimum funding requirements.
The Company is the sponsoring employer of 
a Group-wide defined benefit pension plan. 
The net defined benefit cost of the plans is 
charged to participating entities on the basis 
of the proportion of scheme membership 
attributable to each legal entity at the 
reporting date. The contributions payable by 
the participating entities are determined using 
an agreed ratio which has been in place for 
approximately ten years. 
Short-term benefits
Short-term employee benefit obligations are 
measured on an undiscounted basis and are 
expensed as the related service is provided. 
A liability is recognised for the amount 
expected to be paid under short-term cash 
bonus or profit-sharing plans if the Company 
has a present legal or constructive obligation 
to pay this amount as a result of past service 
provided by the employee and the obligation 
can be estimated reliably. 128 Oxford Instruments plc Report and Financial Statements 2017
Notes to the Parent Company Financial Statements continued 
year ended 31 March 2017
(a) Accounting policies continued
Termination benefits
Termination benefits are recognised as an 
expense when the Company is demonstrably 
committed, without realistic possibility of 
withdrawal, to a formal detailed plan to either 
terminate employment before the normal 
retirement date, or to provide termination 
benefits as a result of an offer made to 
encourage voluntary redundancy. Termination 
benefits for voluntary redundancies are 
recognised as an expense if the company has 
made an offer of voluntary redundancy, it is 
probably that the offer will be accepted, and 
the number of acceptances can be estimated 
reliably. If benefits are payable more than 
twelve months after the reporting date, then 
they are discounted to their present value.
Share-based payment transactions
The grant date fair value of share-based 
payments awards granted to employees is 
recognised as an employee expense, with 
a corresponding increase in equity, over 
the period in which the employees become 
unconditionally entitled to the awards. 
The fair value of the awards granted is 
measured using an option valuation model, 
taking into account the terms and conditions 
upon which the awards were granted. The 
amount recognised as an expense is adjusted 
to reflect the actual number of awards for 
which the related service and non-market 
vesting conditions are expected to be met, 
such that the amount ultimately recognised 
as an expense is based on the number of 
awards that do meet the related service and 
non-market performance conditions at the 
vesting date. For share-based payment awards 
with non-vesting conditions, the grant date 
fair value of the share-based payment is 
measured to reflect such conditions and there 
is no true-up for differences between expected 
and actual outcomes.
Where the Company grants options over 
its own shares to the employees of its 
subsidiaries it recognises, in its individual 
Financial Statements, an increase in the cost 
of investment in its subsidiaries equivalent 
to the equity settled share-based payment 
charge recognised in its consolidated Financial 
Statements with the corresponding credit 
being recognised directly in equity. Amounts 
recharged to the subsidiary are recognised 
as a reduction in the cost of investment in 
subsidiary. If the amount recharged exceeds 
the increase in the cost of investment the 
excess is recognised as a dividend.
Own shares held by ESOP trust
Transactions of the Company-sponsored 
ESOP trust are treated as being those of the 
Company and are therefore reflected in the 
Company Financial Statements. In particular, 
the trust’s purchases and sales of shares in the 
Company are debited and credited directly 
to equity.
Provisions
A provision is recognised in the Balance Sheet 
when the Company has a present legal or 
constructive obligation as a result of a past 
event, that can be reliably measured and it is 
probable that an outflow of economic benefits 
will be required to settle the obligation. 
Provisions are determined by discounting the 
expected future cash flows at a pre-tax rate 
that reflects risks specific to the liability.
Leases
Payments (excluding costs for services and 
insurance) made under operating leases are 
recognised in the profit and loss account on a 
straight-line basis over the term of the lease. 
Lease incentives received are recognised in the 
profit and loss account as an integral part of 
the total lease expense.
Foreign currencies
The Company enters into forward exchange 
contracts and options to mitigate the 
currency exposures that arise on sales and 
purchases denominated in foreign currencies. 
Transactions in foreign currencies are 
converted into Sterling at the rate ruling 
on the date of the transaction. Monetary 
assets and liabilities denominated in foreign 
currencies are translated at the rates ruling at 
the Balance Sheet date or at the appropriate 
forward contract rates. Exchange profits and 
losses arising from the above are dealt with in 
the profit and loss account.
Own shares held by Employee  
Benefit Trust (“EBT”)
Transactions of the Group-sponsored EBT are 
included in the Group Financial Statements. 
In particular, the trust’s purchase of shares in 
the Company are debited directly to equity.
Investments
Investments in subsidiaries are stated at cost, 
less any provision for impairment, where 
appropriate. 
Provisions
Provisions are recognised in the period 
when it becomes probable that there will 
be a future outflow of funds resulting 
from past expectations or events which 
can be reasonably estimated. The timing 
of recognition requires the application of 
judgement to existing facts and circumstances 
which can be subject to change. Amounts 
provided represent the Group’s best estimate 
of exposure based on currently available 
information.
Dividends on shares presented  
within Shareholders’ funds
Dividends unpaid at the Balance Sheet date 
are only recognised as a liability at that date 
to the extent that they are appropriately 
authorised and are no longer at the discretion 
of the Company. Unpaid dividends that do not 
meet these criteria are disclosed in the notes 
to the Financial Statements.
Financial guarantee contracts
Where the Company enters into financial 
guarantee contracts to guarantee the 
indebtedness of other companies within its 
Group, the Company considers these to be 
insurance arrangements and accounts for 
them as such. In this respect, the Company 
treats the guarantee contract as a contingent 
liability until such time as it becomes probable 
that the Company will be required to make a 
payment under the guarantee.
(b) Loss for the year
The Company’s loss for the financial year 
was £6.7m (2016: loss of £5.4m). Other 
Comprehensive Income in the year was 
£1.7m (2016: £3.5m). The expense will not 
subsequently be reclassified to profit or loss. 
The auditor’s remuneration comprised 
£140,000 (2016: £150,000) for the 
statutory audit.
The average number of people employed by 
the Company (including Directors) during the 
year was 51 (2016: 51). All of these individuals 
were involved in administration. 01: Strategic Report 02: Governance 03: Financial Statements 04: Company Information

A reduction in the UK corporation tax rate from 21% to 20% (effective from 1 April 2015) was substantively enacted on 2 July 2013. Further 
reductions to 19% (effective from 1 April 2017) and to 18% (effective from 1 April 2020) were substantively enacted on 26 October 2015, 
and an additional reduction to 17% (effective from 1 April 2020) was substantively enacted on 6 September 2016. This will reduce the company’s 
future current tax charge accordingly. The UK deferred tax liability at 31 March 2017 has been calculated based on those rates. 
(i) Pension commitments
Defined benefit scheme
The Oxford Instruments Pension Scheme (The “Scheme”), a defined benefit scheme, was closed to new members from 1 April 2001 and to future 
accrual from the year to 31 March 2011. The Company continues to make deficit recovery contributions to this Scheme. Contributions are based 
on the pension deficit of the Group as a whole. The assets of the Scheme are held in a separate trustee-administered fund. 
During the prior year, the Group went through a detailed exercise to attempt to identify an employer for each member of the scheme. The actuary 
used this data to apportion the pension liability of each member to the appropriate employing company. For approximately one quarter of 
members it was not possible to identify an employing company. The liability in respect of these members has been allocated to the employers in 
proportion to the known liabilities for each employer.
Details of the scheme and most recent actuarial valuation can be found in Note 26 to the Group Financial Statements. The contributions paid by 
the Company to the Oxford Instruments Pension Scheme were £0.4m (2016: £0.4m).
Stakeholder pension scheme
The Company makes contributions to a stakeholder pension scheme. The pension costs charge for the year represents contributions payable by 
the Company to the scheme. These amounted to £0.1m (2016: £0.2m). There were no outstanding contributions at the end of the financial year 
(2016: £nil). 
(j) Guarantees
The Company has given a guarantee to the pension scheme in respect of the liability of its UK subsidiaries to the pension scheme. The guarantee 
is for the excess of 105% of the liabilities of the scheme, calculated on the basis of Section 179 of the Pensions Act 2004, over the assets of 
the scheme.
The Company and its UK subsidiaries have entered into a cross-guarantee for £10.0m (2016: £10.0m) in respect of overdraft facilities of which £nil 
(2016: £nil) was drawn at the year end.
(k) Commitments
At 31 March 2017, capital commitments contracted were £nil (2016: £nil) and authorised were £nil (2016: £nil). 
(l) Subsequent events
See Note 33 to the Group Financial Statements for details of dividends paid or declared after the Balance Sheet date.
(m) Related party transactions
The Company has a related party relationship with its Directors and Executive Officers and with its wholly owned subsidiary companies.
Transactions with key management personnel are disclosed in the Remuneration Report on pages 60 to 75. There were no other significant 
transactions with key management personnel in either the current or preceding year other than the following.
During the year the Company paid £0.1m (2016: £0.2m) to Imperialise Limited, a company for whom Nigel Keen is a Director. The payment was 
for his services as Chairman of the Group. The liability due to Imperialise Limited at the year end was £nil (2016: £nil). 134 Oxford Instruments plc Report and Financial Statements 2017
