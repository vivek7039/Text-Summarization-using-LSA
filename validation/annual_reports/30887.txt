Annual Report 2017
Strategic report Governance Financial statements The year in review
There is no doubt that 2017 was a successful 
year and, most importantly, a year in which 
the leadership baton was smoothly and 
efficiently passed over to Charles Woodburn 
as Chief Executive of the Group.
The Company’s long-term health and growth 
were further underpinned by contracts 
successfully secured during the year on major 
programmes in our principal and international 
markets. Notably, these included contracts to 
supply frigates and submarines for the Royal 
Navy, new and upgraded land vehicles for 
the US, M777 howitzers for India, and strong 
global demand for our world-class defence 
and commercial electronic systems capabilities. 
In December, we entered into a contract 
to supply Typhoon aircraft to Qatar, subject 
to financing conditions, and we remain 
cautiously optimistic of securing further 
aircraft sales to international customers. 
Our cyber and intelligence capability 
remains in high demand from government 
and commercial customers around the world, 
in a challenging market environment. It is 
equally critical in ensuring best-in-class cyber 
protection for our own defence platforms, 
products and services. In recent years, we 
have leveraged our capabilities into the 
commercial sector, where on occasions 
increased volume has been achieved at 
the expense of value. This has now been 
addressed through a change of management 
and by refocusing the business into markets 
where specialised skills provide competitive 
edge and attractive returns.
During the second half of the year, our 
organisation structure was simplified and aligned 
with the demands of the business today.
 “There is no doubt that 2017 
was a successful year.”

Chairman’s 
letter These changes acknowledge the increasing 
requirement for in-country production by 
our customers, the need to continuously hone 
our competitive edge in all markets and the 
emphasis that must be placed on efficient 
execution of a strong order book.
For my part, as Chairman, I have been pleased 
to witness the Company’s ability to manage 
structural and leadership change in a 
turbulent year.
It has been made clear to me by customers, 
shareholders, employees and partners that 
all have valued the preservation of seasoned 
executive experience with the introduction 
of fresh thinking and renewed energy in 
the management team at a time of 
geopolitical turbulence.
Relationships and reputation are, of course, key 
to the success of any business. In this context, 
it is pleasing that close liaison with governments 
in the UK, US, the Gulf, Australia, India and 
many other key international markets, continues 
to ensure the strength of our relationships at the 
highest levels and underline our commitment 
to contributing to national priorities across 
the globe. This will be particularly important 
in 2018 in the pursuit of major business 
opportunities in air, maritime, land and 
cyber currently under negotiation. 
The year ahead, therefore, remains 
demanding, both in delivering the order 
book we have and building an even 
stronger backlog for the long-term future 
of the business, but we approach it with 
confidence and enthusiasm.
Our strategy
Whilst market conditions may fluctuate, 
our strategy remains clear. We are an 
international defence company operating in 
the domains of air, maritime, land and cyber 
with major business interests in the UK, US, 
the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and Australia.
We manage a balanced business of products 
and services, employing world-class skills 
in technology and engineering to meet our 
customers’ current and future needs. We 
use these capabilities primarily in the defence 
sector but, where appropriate, extend our 
reach into related and adjacent commercial 
market areas.
We develop the skills necessary to supply 
our customers by a commitment to 
apprenticeships, graduate training and 
life-long learning. 
The cash we generate from the business 
is used to pay our people, pay our taxes, 
meet our pension obligations, invest in the 
business through research and technology 
and capital expenditure, reward shareholders 
and make acquisitions, when appropriate.
To deliver this strategy, we have a well-defined 
operational framework, underpinned by a 
strong culture which seeks to be trusted, 
innovative and bold.
Our culture
As a company, we focus not simply on how 
much money we make but, more importantly, 
how we make money. The tone is set at the 
top and cascades throughout the organisation.
We are proud of what we do and committed 
to serve and equip those that serve and 
protect us. We aim to inspire and excel in the 
work we do and the technology we develop.
The management ethos is to work with 
customers in the spirit of partnership, 
striving to go the extra mile in the products 
we make and the service we offer, 
recognising that we must earn everything 
and are entitled to nothing.
As Chairman, I believe we should place 
safety above profit, people above process, 
and ethics above outcomes, in an environment 
that promotes merit and values diversity. 
Our Corporate Responsibility Committee 
monitors performance in these areas.
Our Remuneration Committee focuses on 
the importance of rewarding management 
commensurate with performance and 
creating a structure that is fair, transparent 
and inclusive in recruiting, securing and 
retaining the best talent.
We believe it is only by adopting these 
principles that we can win the backing of 
our stakeholders and the support of society 
at large.
The Audit Committee continues to be the 
check and balance that we have to ensure 
we account conservatively, manage prudently 
and manage risk effectively. In discharging 
these responsibilities, the Committee works 
closely with management, internal audit 
and the external audit team to gather 
their perspectives and ensure the integrity, 
accuracy and veracity of our financial 
reporting to a high standard.

BAE Systems
Annual Report 2017
Strategic report Governance Financial statements At the heart of the business are the people 
we employ and the talent we build from 
apprentice to boardroom. As an international 
leader in engineering and technology, we 
believe we have a responsibility to develop 
a deep pool of expertise through high-quality 
training and apprenticeships, with some 
2,000 apprentices and 500 graduates 
currently in training in the UK.
Board and Executive Committee
With effect from 1 July, Charles Woodburn 
succeeded Ian King as Chief Executive. 
Ian retired after a career spanning more than 
40 years at the Company, including leading 
BAE Systems as Chief Executive since 2008. 
Building a pipeline of talent and managing 
succession at all levels in the business is, of 
course, an essential part of strategic planning. 
Our Nominations Committee consistently 
reviews membership of the Board and 
Executive Committee. In this respect, in 2017, 
we were fortunate to recruit Revathi Advaithi 
as a non-executive director bringing wide 
international operational experience with 
strong engineering and digital credentials, 
and Karin Hoeing as Group Human Resources 
Director and member of the Executive 
Committee. As we look forward, beyond 
the current year, we will continue to refresh 
the Board and Executive Committee to ensure 
our experience and skillset is fit for purpose 
in a changing world.
To avoid complacency and in the pursuit 
of excellence, we conduct rigorous annual 
reviews of the Board with the employment 
of an external advisor every other year. The 
key findings of the 2018 Independent Board 
Evaluation are outlined in the Chairman’s 
Governance letter on page 72 of this report. 
As a Board, we debate and review our 
culture each year to ensure we continue to 
treat everyone respectfully, trade responsibly, 
act with integrity and govern scrupulously.
Summary
In summary, we have been pleased to deliver 
another year of good performance with sales 
of £19.6bn and underlying earnings per share 
of 43.5p, underpinned by an order backlog 
of £41.2bn.
Against the background of a strong Board, 
and a refreshed and committed management 
team, we are both content with the year’s 
performance and positive about our future 
prospects. 
The Board therefore has recommended a final 
dividend of 13p for a total of 21.8p per share 
for the full year. Subject to shareholder 
approval at the May 2018 Annual General 
Meeting, the dividend will be paid on 1 June 
2018 to holders of ordinary shares registered 
on 20 April 2018.

Annual Report 2017
Chairman’s letter 
continued  “BAE Systems delivered a 
good performance in 2017 , 
consistent with our 
expectations for the year.”
Charles Woodburn Chief Executive
Introduction
BAE Systems delivered a good performance 
in 2017, consistent with our expectations for 
the year. We are taking the actions necessary 
to address costs and to meet our customers’ 
affordability challenges. Despite economic 
and political uncertainties, governments in 
our major markets continue to prioritise 
defence and security, with strong demand 
for our capabilities. We are investing in our 
business, our people, and in the technology 
and skills we need to drive the business 
forward. With an improving outlook for 
defence budgets in a number of our markets 
and a solid foundation for medium-term 
growth, we are well placed to generate 
good returns for shareholders.
Since taking on the role of Chief Executive, 
I have reiterated that we are a strong company, 
with a number of key advantages, pursuing 
the right strategy.
We have a broad geographic footprint and 
diversified market positions. Importantly, 
our track record of successful partnerships in 
international markets to develop local industry, 
employment and skills is now becoming a key 
requirement to do business in those markets.
We have world-class technologies in the fields 
of electronic warfare, autonomous systems, 
advanced manufacturing, robotics and data 
analytics, and we continue to invest in 
research and development, often alongside 
our customers, to identify and develop 
emerging technologies. The speed of change 
in technology means that we must continually 
build on our technological advantage, and 
attract and retain the right talent in order 
to stay competitive. 
It is important to recognise that in a tough, 
competitive market, we need to become a 
stronger, smarter and sharper organisation 
to win new business and grow, which means 
increasing our focus and efforts in three 
priority areas:
Operational excellence
We have a number of major programmes 
under way on which we are ramping up 
production, so it is vital that we maintain 
our focus on operational excellence by 
delivering for our customers. There is simply 
no better way to highlight our skills and 
capabilities and, therefore, win new business.

Annual Report 2017
Strategic report Governance Financial statements
Chief Executive’s 
review Our US electronics business delivered good 
operational performance across our core 
franchise positions in the high-technology 
areas of electronic warfare, precision-guided 
munitions, Intelligence, Surveillance and 
Reconnaissance, and electro-optics. 
BAE Systems has sustained its leadership 
position in the US electronic warfare market 
and production is ramping up to execute orders 
across a number of programmes, some of 
which are classified. As the electronic warfare 
system supplier on the F-35 Lightning II 
combat aircraft programme, we are increasing 
production and are well positioned to meet 
further increases in output rates over the 
coming years to meet the requirements 
of both US and international customers. 
On F-15, upgrade programmes are contracted 
and progressing for the US Air Force and 
international customers.
The Group’s US-based combat vehicles 
business is underpinned by programmes for 
the manufacture of Armored Multi-Purpose 
Vehicles and M109A7 self-propelled 
howitzers, and Bradley upgrades which all 
progressed in the year. In the amphibious 
vehicle market, 16 prototypes have been 
delivered to the US Marine Corps under the 
Amphibious Combat Vehicle 1.1 programme. 
We are one of two competitors for this 
programme, with final down-selection 
expected in 2018.
BAE Systems is a leading supplier of ship 
repair services to the US Navy and continues 
to adjust its workforce and facilities to meet 
evolving demand. Additional dry dock capacity 
at our San Diego shipyard became operational 
in February 2017 and accepted its first ship 
during the year. 
Whilst market conditions remain highly 
competitive and continue to evolve, our 
US-based Intelligence & Security business 
is focused on delivering on its contracts 
and maintaining a high level of bid activity.
UK
Defence and security remains a priority for 
the UK government. We expect this to be 
reaffirmed in the National Security Capability 
Review, and in the Modernising Defence 
Programme, which was announced in 
January 2018 by the Defence Secretary. 
Transition arrangements after March 2019 
will be important to enable companies to 
prepare for potential changes in the regulatory 
environment. As there is relatively limited 
UK-EU trading and movement of EU nationals 
into and out of BAE Systems’ UK businesses, 
the resulting Brexit impact on the business is 
likely to be limited, depending on the terms 
of any transition and final agreements for 
the UK’s future relationship with the 
European Union.
We will support the government in achieving 
its aim to ensure that the UK maintains its key 
role in European security and defence 
post-Brexit, and to strengthen bilateral 
relationships with key partners in Europe. This 
will be important for ongoing collaboration in 
the development of defence capabilities.
In December, BAE Systems and the 
Government of Qatar entered into a contract, 
valued at approximately £5bn, for the supply 
of 24 Typhoon aircraft. Alongside supplying 
the aircraft, the agreement provides for the 
supply of ground support to the Qatar 
Armed Forces and delivery of technical and 
pilot training in Qatar. The contract is subject 
to financing conditions and receipt by the 
Group of first payment which are expected 
to be fulfilled no later than mid-2018.
Discussions with current and prospective 
operators of the Typhoon aircraft continue 
to support the Group’s expectations for 
additional Typhoon contract awards. However, 
there can be no certainty as to the timing of 
these orders. 
As a result of reducing production activity 
on Typhoon and Hawk, and also taking into 
account the changes to support requirements 
as the Royal Air Force transitions from Tornado 
to F-35 Lightning II, the business announced 
in October a total proposed headcount 
reduction of up to 1,400 roles over the 
next three years.
Competitiveness
Good progress has been made in making 
the organisation more efficient over the 
last few years, and there are further 
opportunities with procurement and 
enhanced collaboration at the forefront.
Technological innovation
We have a long heritage of developing 
and integrating cutting-edge technologies 
to create complex systems that give our 
customers a capability advantage. The 
accelerating pace of technological change 
is a disruptive force and a key driver of 
competitive advantage and, increasingly, 
a determinant for our customers in 
awarding new business. 
Driving performance in these three areas 
will be key for the development of the 
business as we execute on our strategy 
in 2018 and beyond. 
2017 performance
US
After seven months under a Continuing 
Resolution that maintained funding at the 
prior year’s level, the fiscal year 2017 defence 
budget ultimately rose by approximately 
4%. Similarly, fiscal year 2018 has begun 
under multiple Continuing Resolutions. 
On 9 February 2018, Congress passed, and 
the President signed, a budget agreement 
that supports the medium-term planning 
assumptions for our US businesses. This 
budget agreement increases the budget 
caps for two years, and extends the current 
Continuing Resolution to 23 March 2018 
to allow lawmakers to pass a fiscal year 
2018 omnibus appropriations bill.
We see continued support for increased 
defence spending in the President’s 
recently-released fiscal year 2019 budget 
request. This request maintains positive 
momentum in funding for military readiness 
and modernisation, and provides greater 
near-term certainty. Our US-based portfolio 
remains well aligned with customer 
priorities and growth areas, such as the 
ramp-up of production on a number of 
our long-term programmes.

iMOTR™, a new 
product designed 
to improve radar 
accuracy
In August, our Intelligence & Security 
business launched a new product, iMOTR
™
. 
This innovative, mobile, multiple-object 
tracking radar uses commercial off-the-shelf 
solutions to provide military test and 
evaluation ranges with a higher degree of 
accuracy in tracking the time, space and 
position information for several objects in 
flight compared with current radars. 
The iMOTR
™
 solution, developed over 
two years with Group-funded research 
and development expenditure, features 
enhanced capabilities that offer more precise 
flight path tracking for objects travelling 
close to the ground and allow tracking 
information to be shared in real time with 
other radars or data collection sensors. 
These added capabilities will allow our 
customers to assess larger, more complex 
scenarios that are critical to developing the 
next generation of solutions to address 
national security threats.

The Typhoon aircraft’s progression towards 
the Royal Air Force Centurion standard will 
enable transition of capability from Tornado 
to Typhoon as the UK Tornado fleet is 
scheduled to come out of service at the 
end of the decade.
UK-based production of rear fuselage 
assemblies for the F-35 Lightning II aircraft 
increased to 82 in the year, with most of the 
advanced manufacturing investment in place 
to achieve the planned increase in production 
volumes. In readiness for the arrival of the 
UK’s first F-35 Lightning II aircraft in 2018, 
good progress has been made on the support 
facilities for the stand-up of the operational 
service at RAF Marham in Norfolk.
In the maritime domain, there remains 
pressure on the Navy’s near-term budgets.
On the aircraft carrier programme, HMS Queen 
Elizabeth successfully concluded initial sea 
trials and entered HM Naval Base, Portsmouth, 
for the first time in August, with operational 
handover to the Royal Navy in December.
Following contract award for the first batch 
of three Type 26 frigates, worth £3.7bn, 
production for the first ship, Glasgow, 
commenced in July. The National Shipbuilding 
Strategy announced in September committed 
to all eight Type 26 frigates to be built in our 
Scottish manufacturing facilities. In October, 
we announced a teaming agreement with 
Cammell Laird for their bid for the UK Ministry 
of Defence’s proposed Type 31e general 
purpose frigate programme.
Submarine activity is increasing with the 
Astute and Dreadnought class submarines 
now both in production and major

The Saudi Arabian In-Kingdom Industrial 
Participation programme continues to make 
good progress and we have commenced 
discussions with the new Saudi Arabian 
Military Industries (SAMI) organisation to 
explore how we can collaborate to deliver 
further In-Kingdom Industrial Participation. 
All of these activities are aligned with our 
long-term industrialisation strategy, as well 
as the Saudi Arabian government’s National 
Transformation Plan and Vision 2030.
On the Salam Typhoon programme, all 
contracted 72 aircraft have now been delivered 
and the Typhoon support contracts are 
operating well, exceeding the baseline flying 
programme contracted with the customer. 
Discussions with the Saudi Arabian customer 
through 2017 resulted in contractual 
agreements under the Saudi British Defence 
Co-operation Programme being formalised. 
These provide support services to the Royal 
Saudi Air Force and Royal Saudi Naval Forces 
for a further five years to 31 December 2021. 
In Australia, the business is underpinned by 
long-term support contracts, whilst activity 
progresses on two major bid opportunities.
Firstly, as one of two tenderers for the 
Land 400 Phase 2 Combat Reconnaissance 
Vehicle programme, we have completed 
the Risk Mitigation Activity contract and 
submitted our final proposal, with final 
preferred tender selection anticipated in 
the first half of 2018.
Secondly, our initial tender response for 
the Commonwealth’s nine-ship SEA 5000 
Future Frigate programme was submitted 
in August and we anticipate a preferred 
tender selection in 2018.
The MBDA joint venture has continued 
to win orders in both domestic and export 
markets. The increase in business volumes 
has resulted in the requirement to expand 
production capacities in the UK and France. 
Our strategy in action
Advanced 
manufacturing 
facilities for 
F-35 Lightning II
In 2017, we demonstrated our military aircraft 
manufacturing expertise as we achieved a 
significant milestone on the F-35 Lightning II 
programme. With the delivery of the 318th 
rear section of the aircraft during the year, 
10% of the projected global customer aircraft 
requirement has now been produced. The 
achievement of this milestone has only been 
possible through investments made in our 
advanced manufacturing facilities and our 
close working relationship with the supply 
chain. Our focus in these areas will enable 
us to meet the ramp-up in production on 
the programme in the coming years.
As a key partner on F-35 Lightning II, 
a premier defence programme, we are 
responsible for approximately 15% of the 
work on each aircraft, excluding propulsion, 
and we play a major role in the programme 
across multiple markets, including the US, 
UK and Australia.

Annual Report 2017
Chief Executive’s review 
continued Cyber security
Applied Intelligence achieved sales growth 
from the continued delivery of national 
security solutions for the UK and international 
governments. In addition, we have deployed 
anti-fraud, regulatory compliance, and cyber 
security products and services across a large 
range of commercial customers.
In 2017, Applied Intelligence reported an 
underlying loss of £61m, including a £24m 
restructuring charge. The first half loss of 
£27m was followed by a reduced second 
half loss, before the restructuring charge, 
of £10m as cost reduction actions started 
to deliver bottom-line benefit. A goodwill 
impairment of £384m was taken in 2017 
reflecting the future level and timing of 
expected returns from the business.
Effective 1 January 2018, the business 
changed its operating model to deliver a 
more targeted portfolio of products and 
services focused on customers within three 
core business units: Government; Financial 
Services; and Technology & Commercial. 
The restructuring will enable a greater 
focus on customer needs and higher levels 
of operational efficiency, in the commercial 
business, that will accelerate improvements 
in competitiveness and profitability.
Balance sheet and capital allocation
The Group’s balance sheet is managed 
conservatively, in line with its policy, to retain 
its investment grade credit rating and to 
ensure operating flexibility. Consistent with 
this approach, the Group expects to continue 
to meet its pension obligations, invest in 
research and technology and other organic 
investment opportunities, and plans to 
pay dividends in line with its policy of 
long-term sustainable cover of around 
two times underlying earnings and to make 
accelerated returns of capital to shareholders 
when the balance sheet allows. Investment 
in value-enhancing acquisitions will be 
considered where market conditions are 
right and where they deliver on the 
Group’s strategy.
Pension schemes
The 2017 UK triennial pension funding 
valuations concluded in November, with the 
aggregate funding deficit as at 31 March 2017 
across the UK schemes at £2.1bn. The deficit 
recovery plan on the Group’s largest pension 
scheme, the BAE Systems Pension Scheme, 
continues to March 2026, with the other 
schemes now with reduced repayment 
periods or fully funded.
The UK funding deficit at 31 March 2017 is 
some £3bn lower than the accounting deficit, 
using like-for-like mortality assumptions and 
asset values at 31 December 2017, largely due 
to lower liabilities as a result of the discount 
rate assumption based on the expected returns 
on the investments held by the schemes.
Research and technology
BAE Systems has developed some of the 
world’s most innovative technologies and 
invests in research and development to 
generate future products and capabilities. 
We embrace disruptive technology, drive 
innovation and invest appropriately both 
on a self-funded basis and in conjunction 
with our customers, universities, and small 
and medium-sized enterprises. Company-
funded research and development contributes, 
along with customer funding, in driving 
focused investment in areas such as defence 
and commercial electronics, military aircraft, 
precision weapons and cyber security.
Responsible business
We continue to build a culture where our 
people are empowered to make the right 
decisions and know where to go to seek 
help or guidance. During 2017, we rolled 
out further ethics training across the Group 
to support employees and, in January 2018, 
launched our revised Code of Conduct.
The safety of our employees, and anybody 
who works on, or visits, our sites, remains 
a key priority. Our safety culture and our 
employees demand high standards for all 
aspects of health and safety. In 2017, there 
was a 3% reduction in the Recordable Accident 
Rate and a 28% reduction in the total number 
of major injuries recorded as we continued to 
focus on reducing risk and embedding safety 
culture to drive improvement.
Recruiting and retaining talented people 
is a key priority. We want every employee 
to reach their full potential within a diverse 
and inclusive work environment. We have 
programmes in place across the business to 
support strategic workforce planning, career 
development and retention, as well as to 
improve diversity and inclusion.
Organisational changes
In October, we announced a restructure of 
our operations outside of the US-managed 
business in support of our three priorities 
of delivering operational excellence, honing 
our competitive edge and accelerating our 
technology innovation. The new operating 
model, effective 1 January 2018, will simplify 
our management structure to create 
strengthened Air and Maritime reporting 
segments, whilst changes to our UK-based 
Applied Intelligence cyber security business 
are focused on meeting customer needs and 
accelerating improvements in competitiveness 
and profitability.
Our 2017 results are re-presented on page 
56 to reflect the organisational changes and 
our segmental guidance for 2018 is presented 
on page 57 on a consistent basis. On pages 
58 and 59, we summarise the short- to 
medium-term prospects for our five principal 
reporting segments from 1 January 2018.
Summary
Our business benefits from a large order 
backlog, strong franchises and established 
positions on long-term programmes in the 
US, UK, Saudi Arabia and Australia. Our 
strategy is clear and well defined, with 
governments in our major markets continuing 
to prioritise defence and security, with strong 
demand for our capabilities. Through 
execution of a consistent strategy, we are well 
placed to maximise opportunities, deal with 
the challenges and continue to generate good 
shareholder returns.

BAE Systems
Annual Report 2017
Group strategic  
framework Supporting our customers
Our strategy is focused on providing a 
vital advantage to our customers across US, 
UK and international markets. In particular, 
we have built strong positions aligned with 
our core defence platforms to support our 
customers in our four principal markets. 
These principal markets – the US, UK, the 
Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and Australia – 
have been identified as having a significant 
and sustained commitment to defence and 
security. BAE Systems has established strong 
and enduring relationships in these markets 
and is recognised as playing a key role in the 
industrial capability of each of these countries.
Our unique position and capabilities
Our strong position in the US through the 
Special Security Agreement, together with 
our standing as the leading defence contractor 
in the UK, provides us with unique capabilities 
that can be leveraged across the Group to 
support our customers. In addition, our diverse 
portfolio, including leading cyber capabilities, 
provides us with a comprehensive offering for 
our customers, with cyber now recognised as 
a defence domain in its own right.
Responding to a changing character 
of conflict
Our business continues to respond to 
geopolitical and technology trends that will 
influence the future character of conflict and 
shape our customers’ requirements. Our 
excellence in complex engineering, developing 
cutting-edge technology and seeking 
innovative solutions enables us to respond 
to our customers’ requirements for greater 
agility, global reach, and advanced technology 
products and services.
International growth aspirations 
Following a number of years of defence 
spend contraction, global defence markets 
are stabilising, with a number of nations 
returning to growth in response to an 
increasingly uncertain security environment.
We continue to recognise the importance and 
requirements of our international customers. 
We have a significant international presence, 
one of the broadest amongst the defence 
primes, supported by long-standing customer 
relationships and diverse capabilities, leveraged 
across the Group.

2. Includes £0.9bn (4%) of sales generated under the 
Typhoon workshare agreement with Eurofighter 
Jagdflugzeug GmbH.
The US continues to represent 
the single largest defence 
market in the world and 
BAE Systems remains a top 
ten defence supplier in the US.
After seven months under a Continuing 
Resolution that maintained funding at the 
prior year’s level, the fiscal year 2017 defence 
budget ultimately rose by approximately 4%. 
Whilst the fiscal year 2018 budget remains 
under a Continuing Resolution, the bipartisan 
budget agreement passed on 9 February 2018 
would increase the US defence budget by 
approximately 10% over current levels, 
reflecting continued growth in defence 
spending to $700bn (£518bn) for the fiscal 
year ending 30 September 2018. This budget 
agreement increases the budget caps for two 
years and extends the Continuing Resolution 
to 23 March 2018 to allow lawmakers to pass 
a 2018 spending bill.
The US defence budget is expected to 
experience continued growth.
The portfolio of the US-based business is 
well aligned with customer priorities and 
growth areas, which include combat vehicles, 
precision-guided munitions, naval ship repair 
and modernisation services, electronic 
warfare, and space security. BAE Systems 
has strong positions on a number of premier 
defence programmes, including F-35 
Lightning II, Paladin self-propelled howitzer 
and Armored Multi-Purpose Vehicle, and we 
are a leader in advanced electronic systems, 
real-time intelligence and analysis, naval gun 
systems and artillery systems.
In addition to our position on US defence 
programmes, the US-based portfolio is also 
focused on Foreign Military Sales and direct 
international sales to allied nations.
We continue to deliver on existing commercial 
programmes, including engine and flight 
controls, and electric drive propulsion systems. 
BAE Systems remains the 
largest defence company 
in the UK, with strong and 
long-standing relationships 
with the Ministry of Defence.
The UK is Europe’s largest defence market 
and, after a period of budgetary decline, 
defence spending has stabilised. The 2017 
Spring Budget reinforced previous 
commitments to increase defence spending, 
as well as the continued pledge to maintain 
spending at 2% of GDP. This provides the 
context for the Modernising Defence 
Programme announced in January 2018 
by the Defence Secretary, the outcome 
of which is aimed to be announced by 
the summer of 2018.
In light of the UK’s referendum decision to 
leave the EU, the government has signalled 
its intent to continue to play a major role in 
defence and security co-operation in Europe.
The UK government provides vital support 
in the pursuit of international export 
opportunities, recognising the value that 
BAE Systems and the defence industry 
contributes to the UK economy.
BAE Systems plays an important role in 
providing capabilities to support the UK 
government and armed forces across the 
air, maritime, land and cyber domains. 
Our involvement across the major UK 
defence programmes, including Typhoon 
aircraft, Queen Elizabeth Class aircraft 
carriers, Type 26 frigates, and Astute and 
Dreadnought Class submarines, maintains 
our diverse skillsets, allowing us to provide 
a vital advantage to our customers.
Our cyber business has a focused 
investment strategy to ensure that we 
support our commercial and government 
customers as cyber security becomes an 
increasingly important part of a sophisticated 
and persistent threat environment.

Annual Report 2017
Our markets 
continued The Kingdom of Saudi 
Arabia continues to be 
a leading military power 
and one of the largest 
defence markets globally.
Saudi Arabia has a strong commitment 
to defence and security spending driven 
by regional security instability. 
Saudi Arabia’s Vision 2030 strategy to 
promote In-Kingdom industrialisation and 
diversification away from reliance on oil 
continues to shape our activities in support 
of Saudi Arabia’s national objectives of 
technology development, local skills, and the 
development of indigenous defence industry 
and capability. Through the restructuring 
of the Group’s portfolio of interests in a 
number of industrial companies, building 
on our strong history in Saudi Arabia, we 
are working in partnership to deliver these 
priorities and we have commenced discussions 
with the new Saudi Arabian Military Industries 
(SAMI) organisation to explore how we can 
collaborate to deliver further In-Kingdom 
Industrial Participation.
We remain well placed as a leading 
in-country contractor in support of air 
defence platforms and training systems 
for the Royal Saudi Air Force, as well as 
support for mine countermeasure vessels 
for the Royal Saudi Naval Forces.
BAE Systems is one of the 
largest defence companies 
in Australia, with strong 
activities across all domains.
Regional instability and the pace of military 
modernisation in the Asia-Pacific region 
continue to drive the government’s 
commitment to defence spending, with 
major recapitalisation programmes expected 
in the air, maritime and land domains.
In addition to a number of key priorities 
highlighted in the Australian Defence White 
Paper, the government indicated its intent 
to grow defence spending by committing to 
spend 2% of GDP by 2020/21. As part of 
this commitment, the government has made 
clear its objective to build a stronger and 
more sustainable domestic defence industry, 
ensuring that over time the nation has in place 
a sovereign industrial base that has the skills, 
knowledge and capability to manage and 
support the platforms and systems it has 
invested in.
We are well positioned to support Australia’s 
initiative for growing domestic capabilities, 
through an established business and a 
workforce based at more than 25 sites across 
the country, in addition to our ability to 
leverage our international positions within 
the Group.
We provide support to the Australian 
Defence Force through engineering, 
programme management and sustainment 
solutions, including Jindalee Operational 
Radar Network upgrade, Hawk Lead-In 
Fighter support, F-35 Lightning II sustainment, 
and Anzac frigate support and upgrade.
BAE Systems has many strong 
and enduring relationships in 
other international markets.
Regional security tensions, the growing 
emphasis on indigenous capabilities and 
varying economic conditions continue to 
influence defence spending internationally. 
With high growth in Asia-Pacific and the 
Middle East, BAE Systems has developed 
relationships with partners and customers 
in a number of countries, working directly 
with local industry.
In Malaysia, we are a supplier to the armed 
forces, both directly and through joint 
ventures. We have set up a Global Engineering 
Centre in Kuala Lumpur focusing on local 
delivery and global support of our cyber and 
financial crime detection services.
We have signed a contract to provide Typhoon 
aircraft to Qatar, subject to financing conditions 
and receipt by the Group of first payment. We 
provide support to Typhoon and Hawk aircraft 
and naval vessels supplied to Oman.
In 2017, we signed a contract to collaborate 
on the first development phase of an 
indigenous fifth-generation fighter jet, 
TF-X, for the Turkish Air Force. Our footprint 
in Turkey is growing through our armoured 
combat vehicles joint venture, FNSS.
We have a strong presence in Sweden 
through our BAE Systems Hägglunds business 
supplying and supporting tracked vehicles 
for international customers.
Our US businesses export combat vehicles 
to international customers, including Brazil 
and Japan.
In India, we have long-established relationships 
with local industry partners. We have a strong 
partnership with Hindustan Aeronautics Limited 
on Hawk aircraft and, more recently, with 
Mahindra Defence Services on M777 howitzers.
Through our shareholding in MBDA, our 
position in the missiles and missile systems 
market continues to grow in European and 
other international markets.

Strategic report Governance Financial statements Supporting STEM 
workshops in Oman
In 2017, our UK and Omani engineering 
graduates ran STEM workshops at schools in 
Adam and Nizwa, close to the Adam air base, 
home to Typhoon aircraft in Oman. The students 
participated in hands-on exercises introducing 
them to engineering, and listened to our 
graduates’ experiences of their time abroad 
and with BAE Systems in Oman.
Engineering and technological disciplines are 
core to the future plans for Oman’s national 
economy. The workshops undertaken by 
BAE Systems in Oman continue to have the full 
backing of the Omani Ministry of Education.
Recruiting and retaining the best people from 
the widest possible talent pool is a key priority 
for BAE Systems.
We value our employees and the contribution 
they make, and we are committed to creating 
an inclusive culture where everyone can fulfil 
their potential. This is essential if we are to 
attract and retain talented people, and drive 
creativity, innovation and our ability to solve 
our customers’ complex challenges.
Our approach
Our human resources strategy prioritises 
employee welfare and development, 
empowerment and knowledge transfer. 
Our Group Human Resources Director 
reports directly to our Chief Executive and 
chairs the HR Council to ensure that our 
strategy supports the Integrated Business 
Plan and People Policy. The Group’s strategy 
is dependent on its ability to recruit and 
retain people with appropriate talent and 
skills, and we have identified this as a 
principal risk (see page 71).
Our People Policy sets out our people 
management expectations, including 
with regard to diversity and inclusion, 
training and development, reward and 
employee engagement. 
Diversity and inclusion
We are committed to creating an inclusive 
environment with a diverse workforce, which 
reflects the communities in which we work. 
Our Chief Executive leads the Enterprise 
Diversity and Inclusion Council which has 
three key priorities:
– build a culture of inclusion and inclusive 
leadership globally;
–  drive a heightened awareness and 
education of diversity and inclusion 
across the organisation; and
– foster diversity and inclusion throughout 
the organisation.
Our businesses are tasked with developing 
strategies and programmes that support 
these priorities and we are implementing 
measures to track progress. 
We are determined to bridge the historical 
gender gap in our industry by encouraging 
more women to join the Company and 
promoting development so that we ultimately 
increase the number of women in senior 
executive positions.
We have employee-led networks supporting 
Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender and Allies 
called OutLink in the UK and US. In the UK, 
this has resulted in a jointly developed 
Transgender Policy being established in 2017. 
Identifying and recruiting talent 
We need to recruit a diverse range of 
professionals to help solve our customers’ 
challenges, including engineers, designers, 
software developers and project managers. 
We look to draw people from a wide range 
of backgrounds and cultures. 
We have been focusing our recruitment 
on the next generation to replace the skills 
and experience we are losing as our 
workforce retires, to mitigate Science, 
Technology, Engineering and Mathematics 
(STEM) skills shortages, and to accelerate 
diversity within our leadership. For example, 
we have partnered with Cranfield University 
to provide the UK’s first-ever Masters-level 
post-graduate engineering apprenticeship 
scheme, with 76 BAE Systems engineers 
starting the programme in January 2018.
Training and development
We want every employee to reach their full 
potential and feel rewarded for what they do. 
We support this through our comprehensive 
career frameworks, development programmes 
and the breadth of our operations. Continual 
improvement of competence and skills transfer 
helps us to continue to develop world-leading 
technologies that give our customers a 
critical advantage.
Our focus on professional development 
throughout our employees’ careers supports 
their personal and professional growth, and 
ensures that we have the skills to meet our 
customers’ current and future requirements.

BAE Systems
Annual Report 2017
Our  
people Reward
We provide our employees with competitive 
reward packages which include a range of 
benefits, and we recognise individual and 
team successes.
The UK government has introduced gender 
pay gap reporting regulations for companies 
with more than 250 employees. For 2017, the 
average gender pay gap for our UK workforce 
was 11.2%, which is lower than the current 
UK national average of 18.1%. We have a 
gender pay gap because we employ around 
four times more men than women and a 
greater proportion of our senior leadership 
team is male. This trend is not unusual for 
companies like ours which employ large 
numbers of people with qualifications in 
STEM-related fields. With the number of 
women who study and work in these fields 
significantly less than the number of men, 
we recruit from a much smaller pool of 
female talent. We continue to work hard 
to increase the number of females we 
employ to improve our gender balance 
and become a more diverse organisation.
Engagement
Effective engagement enables our 
employees to contribute to improving 
business performance and helps us to gauge 
our success in creating an environment in 
which everyone can fulfil their potential.
We encourage employees to become 
shareholders in BAE Systems and, in some 
markets, offer share schemes to support this. 
We keep employees informed about what 
is happening across the business, including 
Company results, major business decisions 
and other matters which affect them, using 
a variety of media, including our intranet and 
e-mail, through podcasts, newsletters and 
leadership blogs, and also through team briefs 
and team meetings where we seek to listen 
to employees’ views and opinions. Employees 
have the opportunity to share their views 
through our employee surveys. 
We seek to maintain constructive relationships 
with our trade unions in the UK and Australia, 
and our labour unions in the US. We have 
structures in place to work with trade union 
representatives in our local markets, where 
it is appropriate and legally acceptable.
Social and community matters
It is important to us and our employees 
that we give back to the communities 
where we have a presence and can make 
a positive difference.
Globally, during 2017, we contributed 
more than £11m
5
 to local, national and 
international charities and not-for-profit 
organisations through our Community 
Investment programme.
Community investment management
Our Community Investment Policy requires us 
to develop and maintain a Global Community 
Investment Strategy which outlines how we 
support our primary focus areas, where a 
measurable impact to the community can 
be demonstrated. 
Our primary focus areas are:
– Customer – supporting active service 
personnel, veterans and their families;
– Education – inspiring young people to 
consider STEM subjects and careers; and
– Local community – working to support 
the communities in which we operate.
An outcome of our Community Investment 
Policy is that each market develops its own 
programme in support of the Global 
Community Investment Strategy and which 
is relevant to their lines of business, charitable 
needs and culture. 
Community investment funding is not paid 
to third-party fundraisers or directly to 
individuals. As part of our due diligence 
procedures, prior to a charitable sponsorship 
or charitable donation being committed, the 
charity is vetted through a recognised external 
organisation to ensure that the funding will 
be used for charitable purposes.
To avoid the risk of conflicts of interest, any 
community investment activity is tested against 
the principle that it does not place, or does 
not appear to place, actual or potential 
customers, suppliers or government officials 
under any obligations. 
The Global Community Investment Committee 
reports to the Executive Committee on all 
community investment activities, including 
employee fundraising activities. 
The impact of the work we do
We have strong ties with armed forces charities 
and organisations that assist serving personnel, 
veterans and their families. In the UK, we 
are proud to be a founder donor (£5m over 
five years) to the Defence and National 
Rehabilitation Centre due to open in 2018. 
Volunteering is important to us and our 
employees, so we enable and encourage 
it to be identified as a personal 
development goal.
In the US, during the 2017 Military Appreciation 
Month integrated campaign, ‘Remember. 
Honor. Support.‘, employee donations to 
selected organisations were double-matched 
by the Company (up to $5,000 per employee) 
for a total of nearly $180,000 (£133,000).
Recruiting the next generation
Our apprenticeship programme is one of the biggest and most progressive in the UK, and is rated 
‘outstanding’ by the Office for Standards in Education (Ofsted). In 2017, we recruited 576 apprentices 
and trainees, 190 graduates and 79 interns. By the end of 2017, we had approximately 2,000 apprentices 
and 500 graduates in training across our UK business, approximately 6% of the workforce. 
Our 2017 apprentice intake figures provided our best ever diversity and inclusion statistics, with 27% female 
and 5% black, Asian and minority ethnic. From a social mobility perspective, in 2016, 18% of our apprentices 
were recruited from the top 20 most deprived wards in England.

Strategic report Governance Financial statements Laser Directed Energy Weapons – changing the nature 
of warfare
Recognising the potential for Laser Directed Energy Weapons (LDEWs) to change the nature of 
warfare, we are leveraging our engineering expertise across our UK and US businesses to accelerate 
the development and introduction of laser capabilities. 
Using focused light energy, LDEWs could be used in a range of operations across the air, maritime 
and land domains, and our aim is to show our customers the potential capabilities of these weapons, 
whilst prioritising safety and affordability. 
We are collaborating with the university community to consider how to protect our platforms 
from LDEWs and how we can shape our future platform designs to ensure protection is built in 
to their development. 1. Including share of equity accounted investments.
We leverage our technology and engineering 
capabilities and invest in research and development 
to deliver competitive solutions for our customers 
now and in the future.
How our business works
Our approach
Technology and innovation are central to our 
business; they underpin our strategy and the 
development of our products and services. 
We scan emerging technologies from 
around the world to assess their potential for 
application in defence and security. We develop 
embryonic technology before selecting 
technologies to mature for use in our products 
and services. To do this, we work across our 
business and we work with our customers, 
academia and other industry partners. In some 
cases, we will acquire other organisations to 
secure exclusive access to technologies that 
are critical for our future.
We also work with potential overseas partners 
as part of our international campaigns and this 
can be a major discriminator in some markets. 
An example of this is our participation, for the 
first time, in a technology symposium with 
Singapore’s Defence Science and Technology 
Agency (DSTA) in 2017. Our hope is that this 
will be the first step in working with DSTA to 
identify and prioritise areas of technology that 
we can jointly explore for future collaboration.
Our people are encouraged to innovate 
and embrace disruptive technologies focused 
on those which will ensure our customers are 
equipped to face present and future threats. 
We look for ways that technology can give 
our customers a competitive edge.
We assess the utility of our existing 
technology to determine if we can create 
value through licences and sales of rights 
to other organisations.
Our investment
Our strategic thinking informs where we invest 
our research and development (R&D) funding 
and resource. This in turn helps us to secure 
customer funding from organisations such 
as the UK Ministry of Defence, the Defense 
Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) 
and the US military service laboratories to take 
the development of the technology to the 
next level.
We target investment in customer priority 
areas and in programmes that will give us a 
competitive advantage. Our R&D programmes 
are designed to improve the capability and 
performance of our products and services, 
reduce the cost of production, and provide 
customers with efficiency savings and lower 
through-life costs.
In 2017, we spent £1.6bn (2016 £1.4bn) on 
R&D, of which £238m (2016 £206m) was 
funded by the Group. In addition, the Group’s 
share of the R&D expenditure of its equity 
accounted investments in 2017 was £0.1bn 
(2016 £0.1bn).
Protecting our investment in new technologies 
is important and we have a portfolio of patents 
and patent applications covering approximately 
2,000 inventions internationally.
We look to make value-adding acquisitions in 
emergent new technologies or in technologies 
that will accelerate our R&D programmes 
and, in 2017, we completed the acquisition 
of IAP Research, Inc., a US engineering 
company focused on the development and 
production of electromagnetic launchers, 
power electronics and advanced materials.

Our  
technology Cobotics – delivering 
manufacturing advantage
Traditional manufacturing processes separate 
the complex tasks performed by humans from 
the simple, repeatable tasks performed by robots. 
In contrast, cobotic systems are designed for 
humans to work collaboratively with robots, 
allowing us to merge the efficiency and 
repeatability from the robot with the skill 
and dexterity from the human operator.
Our ongoing development of cobotic technology 
is focused on how we can provide more agility 
in the manufacturing environment, increase 
productivity, reduce costs and deliver improvements 
in safety. Advances in sensor technology, robotics 
design and machine learning will increasingly 
enable humans to work safely alongside machines 
without stopping the production line. Our aim is 
to produce a system with the ability to adapt to 
the user interfacing with it, thereby becoming the 
ultimate manufacturing assistant.
Our areas of focus
Today, there are BAE Systems technologies 
operating from the depths of the ocean to 
the far reaches of space. However, the 
technologies that have brought us to where 
we are today will not see us through the next 
decades. This is why we are investing in key 
technologies that will be important for our 
customers in the future and which will bring 
value to our business over the coming years.
Areas of focus include:
– Big data – developing technologies and 
capabilities that allow us to analyse and 
deduce relevant information from vast 
amounts of data. This is of growing 
importance for both the defence and 
commercial sectors.
– Stealth – continuing to invest in the 
development of materials, design 
approaches, manufacturing techniques 
and support processes that minimise the 
observability of our military products.
– Electronic warfare – developing this 
advanced technology to help pilots identify, 
monitor, analyse and respond to potential 
threats. We are also investing to improve 
our efficiency and capacity in defence 
electronics production.
– Autonomy – investing in the development 
and integration of autonomous systems 
technologies. They will play an increasingly 
important role in future conflict by removing 
armed forces personnel from dull, dirty 
and dangerous tasks while ensuring humans 
remain in control, continuing to make 
critical military decisions. 
– Laser Directed Energy Weapons – 
commencement of a programme to 
develop a laser weapon integration 
capability and accelerate its introduction 
into operational service.
– Advanced manufacturing – positioning 
our manufacturing capability to meet future 
product and platform demands through 
the development and exploitation of novel 
materials and advanced manufacturing 
technologies.
Chief Technology Officer
Technology is a key priority for our business 
and a new Chief Technology Officer (CTO) 
was appointed at the start of 2018 to focus 
on our investment in, and development 
and exploitation of, technologies across 
our products, services and operations. 
Nigel Whitehead, a member of the Executive 
Committee, assumed the role of CTO and, 
working with the BAE Systems, Inc. business, 
he will also oversee functional collaboration 
across the Group on technology, IT and 
digital strategy; manufacturing; engineering; 
support; and project management.

Annual Report 2017
Group financial  
review Net finance costs, including equity 
accounted investments, were £380m 
(2016 £619m). The underlying interest 
charge, excluding pension accounting, and 
fair value and foreign exchange adjustments 
on financial instruments and investments 
decreased marginally to £245m (2016 £257m). 
Net interest expense on the Group’s pension 
deficit was £173m (2016 £177m). There was 
a credit in respect of fair value and foreign 
exchange adjustments of £38m (2016 £185m 
charge) on exchange translation of US 
dollar-denominated bonds.
Taxation expense, including equity accounted 
investments, of £287m (2016 £249m) reflects 
the Group’s underlying effective tax rate for 
the year of 21%, partially offset by a £40m 
credit in respect of US tax reform enacted in 
December 2017. The US federal tax rate has 
been reduced from 35% to 21% with effect 
from 1 January 2018, while the estimated 
state tax rate has increased from 5% to 6%. 
In line with this change, the rate applying 
to US deferred tax assets and liabilities at 
31 December 2017 has been reduced from 
40% to 27%, creating a rate adjustment 
in 2017, which is partly reflected in the 
income statement.
The calculation of the underlying effective tax 
rate is shown in note 6 to the Group accounts 
on page 155.
The underlying effective tax rate for 2018 
is expected to reduce from 21% to around 
18% benefiting from US tax reform, with 
the final rate dependent on the geographical 
mix of profits.
Looking beyond 2018, the effective tax rate 
will depend principally on whether there are 
any changes in tax legislation in the Group’s 
most significant countries of operation, the 
geographical mix of profits and the resolution 
of open issues.

Group financial review 
continued Cash flow
Operating business cash flow was 
£1,752m (2016 £1,004m), which includes 
cash contributions in respect of pension 
deficit funding, over and above service 
costs, for the UK and US schemes totalling 
£271m on a funding basis.
The remainder of the advances received 
in 2012 on the Omani Typhoon and Hawk 
order, as well as European Typhoon 
production, are almost all now consumed. 
On the Saudi support contracts renewal, 
some £300m of cash was received in 2017 
representing advance funding to be utilised 
in 2018 and 2019. Costs have been incurred 
against provisions created in previous years as 
the US commercial shipbuilding programmes 
are closed out. Approximately £100m of 
VAT payments rolled from December 2017 
into January 2018.
Taxation payments increased to £227m 
(2016 £187m) in line with the increase in 
adjusted profit before taxation as calculated 
in note 6 to the Group accounts on page 155.
Net capital expenditure and financial 
investment was £444m (2016 £450m). 
As planned, capital investment was made 
in support of the production ramp-up 
in our US Electronic Systems and Combat 
Vehicles businesses.
Dividends received from equity 
accounted investments of £72m (2016 
£38m) is primarily receipts from MBDA, 
FNSS and Advanced Electronics Company. 
There was a higher dividend from MBDA 
in 2017.
Interest received was £23m (2016 £10m).
The cash outflow in respect of acquisitions 
and disposals in 2017 of £11m reflects 
costs incurred in respect of the disposal of 
BAE Systems San Francisco Ship Repair and 
the acquisition of IAP Research, Inc. The cash 
inflow in 2016 of £6m reflected the sale of 
a 4.1% shareholding in a subsidiary company 
in Saudi Arabia.
Interest paid was £204m (2016 £210m).
Equity dividends paid in 2017 represents 
the 2016 final (£404m) and 2017 interim 
(£280m) dividends.
Dividends paid to non-controlling 
interests decreased to £8m (2016 £24m) 
reflecting a lower payment by Saudi 
Maintenance & Supply Chain Management 
Company in which the Group has a 
51% shareholding.
There was a cash outflow from matured 
derivative financial instruments of £83m 
(2016 £480m inflow) from rolling hedges 
relating to balances with the Group’s 
subsidiaries and equity accounted investments. 
The cash flow partially offsets the foreign 
exchange translation on the Group’s external 
US dollar-denominated borrowing (see below).
Net cash flow from loans in 2016 
represented repayment of a $350m (£286m) 
3.5% bond at maturity.
Foreign exchange translation primarily 
arises in respect of the Group’s US dollar-
denominated borrowing. In 2016, this was 
materially offset by the cash flow from 
matured derivative financial instruments 
(see above).

Balance sheet
The £0.9bn decrease in intangible assets 
to £10.4bn (2016 £11.3bn) mainly reflects 
exchange translation (£0.5bn) and the Applied 
Intelligence goodwill impairment (£0.4bn).
Property, plant and equipment, and 
investment property is £2.0bn (2016 £2.0bn).
Equity accounted investments and 
other investments increased to £390m 
(2016 £305m) reflecting the Group’s share 
of profit for the year (£116m) and reduced 
pension allocation from the lower deficit 
(£66m), less dividends received (£72m).
The Group’s share of the net IAS 19 
pension deficit reduced to £3.9bn 
(2016 £6.1bn) mainly reflecting asset returns, 
updated mortality tables and allowances for 
future mortality improvements. The major 
movements in the net pension deficit 
are shown in the bridge chart below.
In November, the 2017 UK triennial funding 
valuations and, where necessary, deficit 
recovery plans were agreed with the trustees 
and certified by the scheme actuaries after 
consultation with the Pensions Regulator.
The funding deficit across the UK schemes at 
31 March 2017 was £2.1bn. The UK accounting 
deficit, using like-for-like mortality assumptions 
and asset values at 31 December 2017, is 
approximately £3bn higher than the funding 
deficit. The discount rate applied to liabilities 
for accounting purposes reflects the yield on 
high-quality corporate bonds. The discount

Annual Report 2017
Group financial review 
continued rate for funding purposes reflects a prudent 
assessment of expected returns on the 
investments held by the schemes. Based 
on the new funding valuations, the Group 
will increase current annual deficit recovery 
payments to the UK schemes to £220m 
a year from 1 April 2018.
Details of the Group’s pension schemes are 
provided in note 21 to the Group accounts 
on page 174.
A net deferred tax asset of £0.7bn (2016 
£1.2bn) relating to the Group’s pension 
deficit is included within net tax assets 
and liabilities.
In aggregate, there was a £0.2bn decrease 
in working capital largely reflecting advance 
funding on support contracts in Saudi Arabia 
and timing of VAT payments, partly offset by 
previous advances now largely utilised.
The Group’s net debt at 31 December 
2017 is £752m, a net decrease of £790m 
from the net debt position of £1,542m at 
the start of the year. There are no material 
debt maturities before 2019. The maturity 
of the Group’s borrowings is shown in the 
chart opposite. 
Cash and cash equivalents of £3,271m 
(2016 £2,769m) are held primarily for the 
repayment of debt securities, pension deficit 
funding, payment of the 2017 final dividend 
and management of working capital.
Net assets held for sale represents the 
Aircraft Accessories and Components 
Company expected to be sold in 2018.
Accounting policies
Critical accounting policies
Certain of the Group’s significant accounting 
policies are considered by the directors to be 
critical because of the level of complexity, 
judgement or estimation involved in their 
application and their impact on the 
consolidated financial statements:

Changes in accounting policies
Effective 1 January 2018, BAE Systems 
adopted IFRS 15, Revenue from Contracts with 
Customers. The Group’s results announcement 
for the half year ending 30 June 2018 will be 
the first to be prepared under IFRS 15.
The new Standard does not change the way 
in which we manage our contracts under 
Lifecycle Management, our mandated 
project management process, or the lifetime 
profitability and cash flow.
Revenue on the majority of contracts, currently 
being recognised based on the completion of 
milestones or deliveries, will cumulatively be 
recognised earlier.
The provisional impact of restating our results 
for the adoption of IFRS 15 is a reduction in 
underlying earnings per share of 1.4p to 42.1p 
for the year ended 31 December 2017 and an 
increase in net assets of £57m at 31 December 
2017. The restated results will be used as the 
comparatives for the Group’s financial 
statements for the year ending 31 December 
2018. The earnings impact on 2018 and 
beyond is not expected to be material.
Details of the impact of IFRS 15 are provided in 
note 34 to the Group accounts on page 199.
Capital
Objectives
Maintain the Group’s investment grade credit 
rating and ensure operating flexibility, whilst:
– meeting its pension obligations;
– pursuing organic investment opportunities;
– paying dividends in line with the Group’s 
policy of long-term sustainable cover of 
around two times underlying earnings;
– making accelerated returns of capital to 
shareholders when the balance sheet allows 
and when the return from doing so is in 
excess of the Group’s Weighted Average 
Cost of Capital; and
– investing in value-enhancing acquisitions, 
where market conditions are right and 
where they deliver on the Group’s strategy.
Policies
The Group funds its operations through 
a mixture of equity funding and debt 
financing, including bank and capital 
market borrowings.
The capital structure of the Group reflects the 
judgement of the directors of an appropriate 
balance of funding required. Three credit rating 
agencies publish credit ratings for the Group:

Dividends
As part of the Group’s capital allocation policy, 
the Group plans to pay dividends in line with 
its policy of long-term sustainable cover of 
around two times underlying earnings.
The Board has recommended a final dividend 
of 13p per share making a total of 21.8p per 
share for the year, an increase of 2% over 
2016. At this level, the annual dividend is 
covered two times. Subject to shareholder 
approval at the 2018 Annual General Meeting, 
the dividend will be paid on 1 June 2018 
to holders of ordinary shares registered 
on 20 April 2018. The ex-dividend date 
is 19 April 2018.
At 31 December 2017, the Company had 
retained earnings of £2.6bn (2016 £2.1bn), the 
non-distributable portion of which is £649m 
(2016 £604m) (see page 202). Total external 
dividends relating to 2017 are £694m (2016 
£677m), including the interim dividend paid 
during the year of £280m (2016 £273m) and 
the final dividend proposed of approximately 
£414m (2016 £404m). On an annual basis, 
the Company receives dividends from its 
subsidiaries to increase further its distributable 
reserves and, accordingly, the Company expects 
to have sufficient distributable reserves to 
support its dividend policy.
The Group’s dividend policy is underpinned 
by its viability and going concern statements 
(see page 81).

Strategic report Governance Financial statements Treasury
The Group’s treasury activities are overseen by 
the Treasury Review Management Committee 
(TRMC). Two executive directors are members 
of the TRMC, including the Group Finance 
Director who chairs the Committee. The TRMC 
also has representatives with legal and tax 
expertise. The Group operates a centralised 
treasury department that is accountable to 
the TRMC for managing treasury activities 
in accordance with the treasury policies 
approved by the Board.
Objectives/policies
Net debt
Maintain a balance between the continuity, 
flexibility and cost of debt funding through 
the use of borrowings from a range of 
markets with a range of maturities, 
currencies and interest rates, reflecting 
the Group’s risk profile.
– Material borrowings are arranged by the 
central treasury department and funds 
raised are lent onward to operating 
subsidiaries as required.
Interest rates
Manage the exposure to interest rate 
fluctuations on borrowings through varying 
the proportion of fixed rate debt relative to 
floating rate debt with derivative instruments, 
including interest rate and cross-currency 
swaps.
– A minimum of 50% and a maximum of 
90% of gross debt is maintained at fixed 
interest rates.
Liquidity

 190 Note 28 to the Group accounts
Tax strategy
The Group’s tax strategy is to:
– ensure compliance with all applicable tax 
laws and regulations; and
– manage the Group’s tax expense in a way 
that is consistent with its values and its legal 
obligations in all relevant jurisdictions.
The Group does not tolerate activities 
designed to facilitate tax evasion offences.
The Group promotes collaborative professional 
working with tax authorities in order to build 
open, transparent and trusted relationships. 
As part of this, the Group engages in open 
and early dialogue to discuss tax planning, 
strategy, risks and significant transactions, 
and discloses any significant uncertainties 
in relation to tax matters. Queries and 
information requests by tax authorities are 
responded to in a timely fashion and the 
Group ensures that tax authorities are kept 
informed about how issues are progressing. 
The Group seeks to resolve issues in real time 
and before returns are filed where possible. 
Fair, accurate and timely disclosures are made 
in tax returns, reports and documents that the 
Group files with, or submits to, tax authorities. 
Where disagreements over tax arise, the 
Group works proactively to seek to resolve 
all issues by agreement (where possible) 
and reach reasonable solutions. In the UK, 
the Group is subject to an annual risk 
assessment by HM Revenue & Customs 
and strives to achieve as low a risk rating as 
can be achieved by a group of BAE Systems’ 
size and complexity.
Whilst the Group aims to maximise the tax 
efficiency of its business transactions, it does 
not use structures in its tax planning that are 
contrary to the intentions of the relevant 
legislature. The Group interprets relevant tax 
laws in a reasonable way and ensures that 
transactions are structured in a way that is 
consistent with a relationship of co-operative 
compliance with tax authorities. It also actively 
considers the implications of any planning for 
the Group’s wider corporate reputation.
The Group is open and transparent with 
regard to decision-making, governance and 
tax planning in its business, keeping tax 
authorities informed of who has responsibility, 
how decisions are reached, how the business 
is structured and where different parts 
of the business are located.
BAE Systems operates internationally and is 
subject to tax in many different jurisdictions. 
The Group employs professional tax managers 
and takes appropriate advice from reputable 
professional firms. The Group is routinely 
subject to tax audits and reviews which can 
take a considerable period of time to 
conclude. Provision is made for known issues 
based on management’s interpretation of 
country-specific legislation and the likely 
outcome of negotiations or litigation. The 
assessment and management of tax risks are 
regularly reviewed by the Audit Committee, 
as is the Group’s tax strategy.
Arm’s-length principles are applied in the 
pricing of all intra-group transactions of 
goods and services in accordance with 
Organisation for Economic Co-operation and 
Development guidelines. Where appropriate, 
the Group engages with governments in 
relation to proposed legislation and tax 
policy. The Group endorses the statement of 
tax principles issued by the Confederation of 
British Industry in May 2013 (www.cbi.org.uk/
cbi-prod/assets/File/pdf/statement-of-tax-
principles.pdf).

Electronic Combat
BAE Systems has sustained its leadership 
position in the US electronic warfare market 
and production is ramping up across a 
number of programmes, some of which 
are classified.
Low-Rate Initial Production (LRIP) hardware 
deliveries for the F-35 Lightning II programme 
continue with Lot 10 and 11 deliveries. We 
have received initial Lot 12 funding, with an 
anticipated final award value in excess of 
$300m (£222m), and a Request for Proposal 
for a potential block buy encompassing 
multiple lots. 
BAE Systems reached a price agreement 
with Lockheed Martin on a $155m (£115m) 
Electronic Warfare Performance Based 
Logistics contract. The award provides 
Electronic Warfare material availability 
and support for the F-35 Lightning II 
aircraft over a five-year period. 
The business is under contracts from Boeing 
and Warner Robins Air Logistics Complex, 
totalling more than $1.0bn (£0.7bn), to install 
the Digital Electronic Warfare System on 
select new F-15 aircraft, upgrade existing 
F-15 aircraft, and to provide spare units and 
modules for an international customer. The 
programme remains on schedule. BAE Systems 
has also received a $311m (£230m) contract to 
provide the Digital Electronic Warfare System 
to support the sale of new F-15 aircraft to 
another international customer.
Following our selection by Boeing in 2015 to 
develop and manufacture the next-generation 
digital electronic warfare system for the 
US Air Force’s Eagle Passive Active Warning 
Survivability System programme to upgrade 
up to 400 F-15 aircraft, we are currently 
executing the $161m (£119m) engineering 
and manufacturing development contract. 
The programme could be worth more than 
$1.0bn (£0.7bn) over its life. 
We have been awarded $87m (£64m) worth 
of modifications to a competitively awarded 
contract for an electronic warfare system for 
the US Air Force Special Operations Command’s 
fleet of C -130J aircraft. The total value of the 
contract, including all options, could exceed 
$300m (£222m). This award extends our 
position to include our electronic warfare 
capabilities on large, fixed-wing aircraft.
Production of our sensor technology for the 
Long Range Anti-Ship Missile has commenced 
following a $40m (£30m) order from prime 
contractor Lockheed Martin. We provided the 
sensor technology that supported a successful 
launch of the missile, demonstrating its ability 
to address the US Navy’s requirement for 
versatile, multi-platform precision munitions 
that enable distributed operations.
For over a decade, we have provided full 
lifecycle support as the prime mission system 
integrator for the US Air Force’s EC -130H 
Compass Call stand-off electronic attack 
platform. We are under contract to cross-deck 
the mission electronics onto a new Gulfstream 
G550 business jet for the US Air Force. 
BAE Systems will continue to sustain the 
existing EC -130H electronics as we develop, 
manufacture, procure, integrate and sustain 
the electronics. The programme could be 
worth more than $2.0bn (£1.5bn) over the 
next decade. 
Due to the sensitive nature of electronic 
combat systems and technology, many of 
our programmes are classified. As a world 
leader in electronic warfare, we continue 
to experience growth in these increasingly 
important areas.
Survivability, Targeting & Sensing
Our Advanced Precision Kill Weapon System 
(APKWS
™
) laser-guided rocket is experiencing 
growing demand, with over 13,000 units 
delivered as at 31 December 2017. In addition 
to expanding its use in the US military, the 
system is generating strong international 
attention, with 19 nations expressing interest. 
The programme received awards totalling 
approximately $300m (£222m) during the year.
We continue to execute on the Terminal 
High-Altitude Area Defence programme. 
We have received a $30m (£22m) production 
contract for long-lead material on Lots 9 and 
10, and anticipate that additional units will 
be added in response to increasing demand. 
On the $236m (£174m) Common Missile 
Warning System programme, we continue 
to deliver to schedule. 
Under the five-year, $434m (£321m) 
Enhanced Night Vision Goggle III and 
Family of Weapon Sights – Individual 
Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity 
contract, we continued to progress the 
production qualification testing.
The US Army’s Family of Weapon Sights 
– Crew Served programme completed its 
System Critical Design Review during the 
year. This seven-year contract awarded 
in 2016 has a potential value of up to 
$384m (£284m).
The LiteHUD
®
 Head-Up Display has been 
selected by critical launch customers for 
integration on multiple platforms. In 2017, 
it had its first flights on a C -130J aircraft, 
a Textron Scorpion jet and our advanced 
Hawk demonstrator aircraft.
In December, the US Department of Defense 
announced that we were awarded a contract 
by the US Army for the Limited Interim Missile 
Warning System programme.
C4ISR Systems
In September, the Communications & 
Navigation Solutions product line joined the 
Intelligence, Surveillance & Reconnaissance 
business to form a new C4ISR Systems 
business that spans the entire mission 
lifecycle (sensing, processing, exploitation 
and dissemination). 
As a leading provider of space-qualified 
subsystems and components, we continue to 
experience growth in the areas of integrated 
on-board processors, reconfigurable processing 
payloads and secure communications.
We have been awarded an $81m (£60m) 
contract for the Network Tactical Common 
Data Link programme to provide the US Navy 
with the ability to simultaneously transmit 
and receive real-time intelligence, surveillance 
and reconnaissance data over multiple data 
links with a system to be fielded on various 
surface ship types.
Since winning the Geospatial Data Services 
Foundational GEOINT Content Management 
programme in 2014, we have been awarded 
orders valued at $214m (£158m). The business 
is meeting all delivery requirements in assisting 
US intelligence community customers with the 
development of advanced geospatial intelligence 
data collection and processing solutions. 
As a provider of signals intelligence capabilities, 
we are executing the $132m (£98m) Tactical 
Signals Intelligence Payloads programme for 
the US Army’s Gray Eagle unmanned aircraft.

Global Analysis & Operations
We are pursuing task orders under a new 
Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity 
contract with an estimated value of more 
than $400m (£296m) to expand our work 
in motion-imagery analysis, analytic training, 
multi-media support and research for the 
US intelligence community. During the year, 
the business secured six task order contracts 
valued at more than $180m (£133m).
We won a position on a US Department of 
Treasury programme to support the Office 
of Terrorism and Financial Intelligence. The 
maximum lifecycle value of all task orders 
to be awarded under the programme is 
estimated at $135m (£100m).

The business is executing on the second year 
of a five-year, sole-source contract worth up to 
$368m (£272m) to provide systems engineering 
services to the US Navy’s Strategic Systems 
Programs office. The programme provides 
support for weapons systems on board 
US Ohio and UK Vanguard Class submarines, 
as well as future Ohio Class replacement and

eight awardees could reach $487m (£360m).
Our strategy in action
Upgrading 
and securing
communications 
capabilities on
US Army vehicles
In October, our engineers achieved a 
significant milestone, successfully upgrading 
the C4I
1
 capabilities of the 5,000th 
mine-resistant tactical vehicle for US and 
allied forces. 
The upgrades, which are performed at 
our state-of-the-art facility in Summerville, 
South Carolina, US, enhance vehicle 
communications systems, intercom systems, 
mobile network systems and soldier 
protective systems on a variety of 
Mine-Resistant Ambush Protected (MRAP)
vehicles, including the MRAP All-Terrain 
Vehicle (M-ATV), MaxxPro Dash and 
RG-31 platforms. 
This important milestone comes as the 
US Army seeks to improve the mission 
capabilities of its tactical vehicle fleet and 
enhance situational awareness for soldiers.

Cyber & Intelligence The US Navy has also selected BAE Systems 
to provide equipment and support services 
for Space and Naval Warfare Systems Center 
Atlantic. As one of several companies involved, 
we will pursue future orders as part of this 
five-year, Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite 
Quantity contract. The total value of all orders 
to be awarded over the life of the contract is 
estimated at $180m (£133m).
On the US Air Force Intercontinental Ballistic 
Missile Integration Support Contractor 
programme, we were awarded over $29m 
(£21m) of additional engineering change 
proposals in 2017, raising the total lifecycle 
value of the contract to $922m (£682m). 
Our work includes programme management, 
systems sustainment, and cyber security 
assessment and defence.
We continue to pursue task orders on 
a nine-year Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite 
Quantity contract to support the US Army 
in developing next-generation technologies 
for space, high-altitude and missile defence.
IT Solutions
Our contract to connect a number of US 
agencies under one shared IT environment 
passed significant security testing and was 
authorised for adoption into the government 
IT infrastructure. Although we executed on 
our task orders and provided IT services to 
foster greater systems integration and 
information sharing for the intelligence 
community, we have been advised that 
future contract options will not be exercised 
as the government reassesses its acquisition 
strategy in favour of a more federated desktop 
approach. We therefore do not anticipate 
any future awards beyond the $164m (£121m) 
of funding to date.
Our business was awarded a contract 
increase of $160m (£118m) to extend the 
period of performance of a major software 
development and IT support contract for 
a US intelligence community customer. 
We received a five-year, $41m (£30m) 
contract with the US Department of 
Homeland Security, National Protection and 
Programs Directorate to provide data analytics, 
risk scoring and systems engineering support, 
as well as cyber security assessment, 
governance and training to ensure all federal 
civilian agencies are in compliance with 
government cyber security regulations.
Organisational changes
Effective 12 February 2018, the business moved 
to a revised operating model to position for 
growth through three customer-focused 
business areas: Integrated Defence Solutions; 
Intelligence Solutions; and Air Force Solutions.
Applied Intelligence
The business has delivered revenue growth 
from the continued delivery of national 
security solutions for the UK and international 
governments, as well as deployment of 
anti-fraud, regulatory compliance, and 
cyber security products and services to 
commercial customers.
UK Services
The business continues to invest in engineering 
disciplines and specialist expertise in the 
cyber, digital and data domains to support 
our customers in national security intelligence, 
national-scale cyber defence, commercial 
cyber security and regulatory compliance. 
We have won a number of contracts with 
both UK government and commercial 
enterprises, helping our customers to 
maximise the benefits of secure IT 
transformation and cyber defence.
International Services & Solutions
The business was underpinned by significant 
demand for our national-scale cyber defence 
capabilities. We continue to work with key 
national security customers in Asia-Pacific 
and the Middle East. Our technical capability 
in multi-source intelligence analytics has 
advanced significantly. In order to improve 
the cost competitiveness of our engineering, 
we are continuing to expand our off-shore 
service operations and delivery centres.
Commercial Solutions
We have a focused set of cyber security, 
anti-fraud and regulatory compliance solutions. 
We continue to see demand for our 
NetReveal
™
 anti-fraud and compliance suite, 
with solutions being deployed to an increasing 
number of prominent multi-national customers 
in the financial services sector. Customers are 
increasingly consuming these solutions as 
multi-year managed services.
We are continuing to renew existing long-term 
customer contracts where we deploy a 
comprehensive portfolio of products. Provision 
of our anti-fraud and anti-money laundering 
capabilities continues to see demand with 
financial services customers.
Organisational changes
In the second half of the year, the business 
commenced a restructuring that resulted 
in a headcount reduction and, effective 
1 January 2018, the business moved to a 
revised operating model to deliver a more 
targeted portfolio of products and services 
focused on customers within three core 
business units: Government; Financial 
Services; and Technology & Commercial. 
The restructuring will enable a greater focus 
on customer needs and higher levels of 
operational efficiency, in the commercial 
business, that will accelerate improvements 
in competitiveness and profitability.

Nearing Full-Rate 
Production on the Paladin 
Integrated Management 
programme
In December, the US Army awarded us 
a $414m (£306m) contract for the third 
and final Low-Rate Initial Production 
option for the M109A7 self-propelled 
howitzer. The award includes options 
to initiate Full-Rate Production which,

US Combat Vehicles
The business continues to perform on a 
number of key franchise combat vehicle 
programmes across both domestic and 
international markets.
On the US Army’s Armored Multi-Purpose 
Vehicle programme, we have nearly 
concluded deliveries of the first 29 vehicles 
under the engineering and manufacturing 
development phase. The contract, which has 
a potential value of $1.2bn (£0.9bn), including 
options for 289 vehicles in Low-Rate Initial 
Production, brings the US Army closer to 
achieving its objective to replace its legacy 
M113 armoured personnel carriers. 
In December, we received a $414m (£306m) 
contract for the third and final option for 
Low-Rate Initial Production of 48 M109A7 
self-propelled howitzers and M992A3 
ammunition carriers under the Paladin 
Integrated Management programme. With 
options for Full-Rate Production of a further 
180 vehicle sets over three years, the award 
is worth approximately $1.7bn (£1.3bn).
The business is executing a $286m (£211m) 
engineering and manufacturing development 
contract to address the space, weight, power 
and cooling limitations of the Bradley family 
of vehicles and to prepare the vehicle for 
communication network upgrades. The 
US customer’s production decision regarding 
the upgrade of approximately 500 vehicles 
over a three-year period is expected in 2018.
In September, we received a contract from 
the US Army worth up to $69m (£51m) 
for the conversion of the next 20 M88A1 
recovery vehicles to the more capable 
Heavy Equipment Recovery Combat Utility 
Lift Evacuation Systems (HERCULES) 
configuration. In March, we received a 
contract from the US Army worth up to 
$112m (£83m) for technical support and 
sustainment of M88 recovery vehicles.
Teamed with Iveco Defence, we completed 
deliveries of the 16 Amphibious Combat 
Vehicle (ACV) 1.1 prototypes to the US Marine 
Corps for testing under the $158m (£117m) 
engineering and manufacturing development 
phase of the programme. We are one of two 
competitors for this programme, with final 
down-selection expected in 2018.
Whilst we have encountered some production 
challenges, work continues on multiple 
contracts totalling $165m (£122m) for Assault 
Amphibious Vehicles (AAVs) for the Japanese 
Ministry of Defence, including a contract for 
30 new AAVs, and an $82m (£61m) contract 
with Brazil to provide 23 upgraded AAVs.
Weapon Systems
BAE Systems remains a leading provider of 
gun systems and precision strike capabilities. 
In February 2017, we completed the acquisition 
of IAP Research, Inc., a US engineering 
company focused on the development and 
production of electromagnetic launchers, 
power electronics and advanced materials.
We continue to execute on a £183m contract 
to provide the gun system known as the 
Maritime Indirect Fire System for the Royal 
Navy’s Type 26 frigate. 
Following the contract modification received 
in 2016 from the Swedish government 
formalising its purchase of an additional 
24 Archer systems, production work continues 
with deliveries expected to begin in 2018. 
In October, we received a contract to deliver 
additional Bofors 155mm BONUS smart 
anti-armour munitions to the Swedish Army 
in 2019. 
In January 2017, we received a $542m 
(£401m) Foreign Military Sale contract from 
the US government to provide 145 M777 
lightweight howitzers to the Indian Army. 
We will build the first 25 guns in our facilities, 
with the remaining systems assembled in 
India by Mahindra Defence Services, our 
selected supplier to establish an assembly, 
integration and test facility in India. The first 
two guns were shipped during the year and 
are progressing through in-country testing.
In July, we received a $47m (£35m) contract 
for the continued development of the 
precision-guided Hypervelocity Projectile, a 
next-generation, low-drag projectile capable 
of executing multiple missions from a number 
of gun systems.
In the complex ordnance manufacturing 
business, we continue to manage the 
US Army’s Radford and Holston munitions 
facilities, operating near capacity. In 2017, 
we received additional funding of $177m 
(£131m) to continue construction of a new 
nitrocellulose facility in Radford. At Holston, 
we are performing on modernisation contracts 
totalling $135m (£100m) for waste water 
management and a $146m (£108m) contract 
for the construction of a nitric acid recovery 
facility to produce larger quantities of 
insensitive munitions.
US Ship Repair
As a leading provider of US Navy ship repair 
and modernisation services, we secured 
firm orders across our US shipyards totalling 
approximately $1.3bn (£1.0bn) in 2017, 
including a $140m (£104m) contract for 
the modernisation of the USS Tortuga at 
our Norfolk shipyard. 
We continue to adjust our workforce 
and facilities to meet evolving customer 
demand, including the new dry dock in 
our San Diego shipyard, which completed 
operational certification in February and 
welcomed the USS New Orleans as its first 
vessel for servicing.
One of the final two commercial ships is 
complete and awaiting acceptance sea trials 
pending identification of a buyer following 
the original customer’s decision not to take 
delivery of the vessel. Construction of the 
final ship is nearing completion and the ship 
is expected to be delivered in the first half 
of 2018.

Our strategy in action
A new concept 
for full-spectrum 
air defence
We take pride in working closely with 
our customers to understand and develop 
the capabilities they require to complete 
their missions. During the 2017 AUSA 
(Association of the United States Army) 
exhibition in October, BAE Systems unveiled 
its Manoeuvre-Short Range Air Defence 
(M-SHORAD) concept vehicle based on a 
Bradley Infantry Fighting Vehicle designed 
to address the US Army’s short-range air 
defence requirements.
The integration of M-SHORAD on an 
existing Bradley vehicle demonstrates 
our ability to bring innovative solutions to 
existing, adaptable platforms. M-SHORAD, 
a multi-spectral solution consisting of 
detection, identification, tracking and 
engagement capabilities to defeat air 
threats, such as unmanned air vehicles, 
integrated on the Bradley would provide 
a full-spectrum air defence solution to 
the US Army.

Military Air & Information
In December, BAE Systems and the 
Government of Qatar entered into a contract, 
valued at approximately £5bn, for the supply 
of 24 Typhoon aircraft. Alongside supplying 
the aircraft, the agreement provides for 
the supply of ground support to the Qatar 
Armed Forces and delivery of technical and 
pilot training in Qatar. The contract is subject 
to financing conditions and receipt by the 
Group of first payment which are expected 
to be fulfilled no later than mid-2018.
In the year, 20 Typhoon aircraft were 
delivered from the UK final assembly facility, 
of which four were delivered to Saudi Arabia, 
completing the contract for 72 aircraft. All 236 
Tranche 2 aircraft have been delivered to the 
UK, Germany, Italy and Spain, together with 
51 of the 88 contracted Tranche 3 aircraft.
There were eight Typhoon and eight Hawk 
aircraft deliveries to the Oman customer in 
the year, with the remaining four Typhoon 
aircraft scheduled to be delivered in 2018.
Good progress continues to be made on 
airframe manufacture for the contract to 
supply 28 Typhoon aircraft to Kuwait secured 
by Italian Eurofighter partner, Leonardo, in 
2016, with fuselage deliveries due to 
commence in 2018.
Development towards the Royal Air Force 
Centurion standard continues, which will 
enable transition of air capabilities from 
Tornado to Typhoon. Flight testing for 
Storm Shadow and Meteor weapons 
capability enhancements was completed 
during the year. Integration of the Captor 
E-Scan radar continues.
We have continued to support our UK and 
European customers’ Typhoon and Tornado 
aircraft and their operational commitments. 
The ten-year partnership arrangement with 
the Ministry of Defence to support the UK 
Typhoon fleet continues as planned, with 
availability of aircraft being sustained at 
contractual levels.
The initial support package has been 
substantially delivered as part of the 
contract to commence operations at a 
new operating air base at Adam in Oman.
On the F-35 Lightning II programme, full 
contract award was secured on Lot 10 and 82 
rear fuselage assemblies were manufactured 
for the Low-Rate Initial Production Lot 10 
and 11 contracts. Negotiations continued 
on Lot 11, with additional order intake received 
in the year of £248m. Lot 11 negotiations are 
expected to conclude during the first quarter 
of 2018, with the balance of the order intake 
also expected in this timeframe.
At RAF Marham in Norfolk, good progress 
has been made on construction of the 
engineering and training facilities and the 
stand-up of the operational service in 
readiness for the arrival of the UK’s first 
F-35 Lightning II aircraft in 2018.
Following the announcement that the UK 
had been chosen as a major European repair 
hub for the maintenance, repair, overhaul 
and upgrade of F-35 Lightning II avionics 
and components, we have established a joint 
venture with the UK Ministry of Defence and 
Northrop Grumman, and progress on 
establishing the repair facility and capability 
continues to plan.
Support continues to be provided to users 
of Hawk trainer aircraft around the world. 
The long-term support contract for the 
Royal Air Force’s UK fleet of Hawk fast jet 
trainer aircraft continues to deliver against 
all contractual milestones.
Discussions continue with the Government 
of India and Hindustan Aeronautics Limited 
(HAL) for the supply of additional kit sets 
which will result in aircraft built under 
licence by HAL for the Indian Air Force 
and Indian Navy.
Following an extensive review with our partner, 
Northrop Grumman, of the requirements and 
conditions of the US Air Force future trainer 
programme, both companies decided not to 
proceed with the competitive bid.
An initial contract for the Anglo-French 
unmanned combat air system feasibility and 
definition phase of £16m was received during 
the year. It is anticipated that an Anglo-French 
follow-on programme will be agreed in 2018.
A £1 19m contract was secured for collaboration 
on the first design and development phase of 
an indigenous fifth-generation fighter jet for 
the Turkish Air Force.
As a result of reducing production activity 
on Typhoon and Hawk, and also taking into 
account the changes to support requirements 
as the Royal Air Force transitions from Tornado 
to F-35 Lightning II, the business announced 
in October a total proposed headcount 
reduction of up to 1,400 roles over the 
next three years.
Maritime
On the aircraft carrier programme, HMS 
Queen Elizabeth successfully concluded 
initial sea trials and entered HM Naval Base, 
Portsmouth, for the first time in August. 
Operational handover and acceptance 
by the Royal Navy took place in December. 
HMS Prince of Wales floated out of the 
dock at Rosyth in December. Large volume 
installation activities continue to progress, 
with commissioning of systems planned to 
commence in 2018 and sea trials beginning 
in 2019.
The full £3.7bn production contract was 
signed in June for the first batch of three 
Type 26 frigates, with £2.8bn of order intake 
in the year, following funding in previous years 
for long-lead items. Production of the first ship, 
Glasgow, commenced in July. The programme 
currently employs over 1,000 people and 
production activities will progressively build 
up during 2018 as more of the ship transitions 
from completion of the detailed design through 
to production readiness. 
The first Offshore Patrol Vessel (OPV), HMS 
Forth, completed sea trials in December and 
was accepted by the Ministry of Defence in 
January 2018. Construction of the remaining 
four OPVs on the Clyde continues.
Under the Maritime Support Delivery 
Framework contract, which the Ministry 
of Defence has agreed in principle to extend 
until 31 March 2020, we provide services 
at HM Naval Base, Portsmouth, and support 
to half of the Royal Navy’s surface fleet. We 
remain on track to achieve target cost. The 
business was unsuccessful on a competitive 
bid to provide equipment procurement and 
equipment management services for the 
Queen Elizabeth Class aircraft carriers and 
Type 45 destroyers.

Production of 
T ype 26 frigates 
for the Royal 
Navy commences
The UK programme to manufacture the 
Type 26 frigate for the Royal Navy is under 
way following the receipt of the full £3.7bn 
production contract for the initial batch of 
three frigates. Progress on the programme 
was highlighted by the cutting of steel on 
Glasgow, the first of the new ships, in July.
Highly-advanced and adaptable, the Type 26 
frigate will be able to fulfil multiple missions 
around the world, from submarine hunting 
to humanitarian assistance. Designed for a 
service life of at least 25 years, the Type 26 
frigates will be a critical part of the future 
Royal Navy surface fleet.

BAE Systems provides significant support 
and maintenance to the Royal Navy’s fleet 
of Type 45 destroyers, and has responded 
to a Ministry of Defence competitive proposal 
on its power improvement project, with the 
award decision expected in 2018.
Progress continues on the £270m Spearfish 
torpedo upgrade demonstration and 
manufacture phases, with the demonstration 
phase forecast to complete in 2020.
Evolving customer requirements and a focus 
on improved efficiency and removing cost 
in the Maritime Services business have led to 
the announcement in October of a proposed 
headcount reduction of around 375 roles. 
The proposed rationalisation will more closely 
align capacity with workload and improve 
competitiveness to retain and grow our 
position on key programmes, while retaining 
critical skills.
The first three Astute Class submarines are 
in operational service with the Royal Navy. 
Progress continues on the manufacture of 
the remaining four boats, with launch of 
the fourth boat, Audacious, achieved in 
April. A full contract award for the sixth 
boat, Agamemnon, was secured in March 
for £1.4bn, with £0.6bn of order intake in 
the year after order intake in previous years 
for long-lead items. Further funding of 
£80m was received for the seventh boat.
Functional and spatial design, and the 
production of the first of class continues 
to advance on the Dreadnought Class 
submarine, the replacement for the 
Royal Navy’s Vanguard Class submarine. 
The next phase of the contract is 
scheduled to commence in April 2018.
The major programme of building works 
at the Barrow site continues, with contracts 
in place totalling more than £500m, with 
two further major buildings being completed 
during the year. 
The detailed arrangements for the 
Dreadnought Alliance, including the 
organisational, governance and commercial 
arrangements between the three parties, 
the Ministry of Defence, BAE Systems and 
Rolls-Royce, continue to be developed. 
Land UK
The business continues to provide UK and 
international customers with a full range 
of light and heavy munitions, with orders 
totalling £133m received in the year. 
During the year, 131 40mm cased-telescopic 
cannons were delivered to the Ministry of 
Defence by CTA International, a joint venture 
between BAE Systems and Nexter, bringing 
cumulative deliveries to 160 of 515. This is the 
first entirely new medium calibre cannon and 
ammunition system qualified by the British 
Army since the late 1960s.
The business has continued to provide support 
to previously supplied armoured vehicles and 
bridging systems, with orders of £48m 
received in the year. The business is one of 
two contenders delivering the design stages 
of the Challenger 2 Life Extension Programme 
and the British Army’s bridging system.

Supporting the operational 
capabilities of the Royal 
Saudi Air Force
Throughout 2017, we have continued 
to provide support to the Royal Saudi 
Air Force Typhoon and Tornado fleets. 
We have delivered against our contractual 
requirements ensuring that, as part of our 
commitment to support the defence needs 
of the Kingdom, an efficient and affordable 
support service is always available.
Building on our success in reducing 
through-life costs for the UK Royal Air 
Force, we have met our commitments in 
supporting Saudi Arabian aircraft across 
maintenance, training, logistics and 
servicing, as well as identifying cost savings 
and process efficiencies. We have done this 
without compromising the effectiveness of 
the aircraft, enabling the Royal Saudi Air 
Force to continue to conduct its vital role 
in the defence of the Kingdom.
In Saudi Arabia, the business provides 
operational capability support to the 
country’s air and naval forces through 
UK/Saudi government-to-government 
programmes. The Saudi British Defence 
Co-operation Programme and Salam 
Typhoon project provide for multi-year 
contracts between the governments.
In Australia, the business delivers production, 
upgrade and support programmes for 
customers in the defence and commercial 
sectors across the air, maritime and land 
domains. Services contracts include the 
provision of sustainment, training solutions 
and upgrades.
In Oman, the business is developing its position 
building on a long history of relationships 
with the Omani armed forces through the 
provision, support and upgrade of defence 
platforms and cyber security services. Business 
generated in Oman is executed through our 
relevant reporting segments.
MBDA is a leading global prime contractor 
of missiles and missile systems across the air, 
maritime and land domains.
Organisational changes

Upgrading 
Australia’s radar 
defence network
In June, we were advised that we have been 
selected as the preferred tenderer to help 
sustain Australia’s radar defence network 
beyond 2042. The Jindalee Operational 
Radar Network (JORN), a network of three 
remote over-the-horizon radars, provides 
wide-area surveillance and the upgrade 
programme will see us carry out important 
work to insert new technologies and extend 
the operational life of the network.
The JORN programme offers further 
opportunities for Australian suppliers as 
our 100% Australian approach will see us 
developing Australian small and medium-
sized enterprises in the supply chain. This 
also ensures that Australia retains control 
of its strategically important sovereign asset 
which plays a vital role in supporting the 
Australian Defence Force’s air and maritime 
operations, border protection, disaster relief, 
and search and rescue operations.

Saudi Arabia
On the Salam Typhoon programme, with four 
deliveries in the year, all 72 contracted aircraft 
have been delivered to the customer. Typhoon 
capability development programmes continue 
to progress. 
The Typhoon support contracts are operating 
well and a contract for support to additional 
flying hours was agreed in April. 
Discussions have continued with the Saudi 
Arabian customer though 2017, resulting in 
contractual agreements under the Saudi British 
Defence Co-operation Programme to provide 
ongoing support services to the Royal Saudi 
Air Force and Royal Saudi Naval Forces for a 
further five years to 31 December 2021. 
Final aircraft deliveries for the first batch 
of 22 Hawk aircraft were completed in the 
second half of the year. The first major units 
of the second batch of 22 aircraft, contracted 
in 2015, have been delivered on schedule 
to Saudi Arabia allowing final assembly 
to commence. 
Under the Royal Saudi Naval Forces’ 
Minehunter mid-life update programme, 
acceptance of the third and final ship is 
expected in the first half of 2018.
Under the planned reorganisation of our 
portfolio of interests in a number of industrial 
companies in Saudi Arabia, Riyadh Wings 
Aviation Academy LLC acquired a 4.1% 
shareholding in a Group subsidiary, Overhaul 
and Maintenance Company, during 2016 
and is expected to acquire a further interest 
up to a maximum of 49%. The reorganisation

) The Saudi Arabian In-Kingdom Industrial 
Participation programme continues to make 
good progress. During 2017, there has been 
further capability and knowledge transfer on 
the Typhoon and Hawk platforms. The first 
Hawk aircraft assembled in Saudi Arabia 
will come off the production line in 2018 
for delivery to the Royal Saudi Air Force.
We have commenced discussions with 
the new Saudi Arabian Military Industries 
(SAMI) organisation to explore how we can 
collaborate to deliver further In-Kingdom 
Industrial Participation. All of these activities 
are aligned with our long-term industrialisation 
strategy, as well as the Saudi Arabian 
government’s National Transformation 
Plan and Vision 2030.
Australia
We have continued to provide in-service 
support to the Navy’s two Landing Helicopter 
Docks under a four-year support contract 
awarded in 2014. Final acceptance of these 
vessels is expected in 2018.
HMAS Stuart, the final Anzac Class frigate 
to be modernised under the Anti-Ship Missile 
Defence programme, has been accepted into 
service by the Commonwealth.
The scope of activities for the next five years 
of sustainment and upgrade of the Anzac 
fleet under the Warship Asset Management 
Alliance has been agreed and contracts 
totalling A$561m (£324m) have been 
awarded to BAE Systems. 
The next upgrade cycle for the Anzac frigate 
fleet, the Mid-Life Capability Assurance 
Programme, has commenced, with the first 
ship, HMAS Arunta, being docked at our 
Henderson shipyard during the second half 
of the year. The upgrade programme is 
planned to run through to 2023.
The delayed JP 2008 Phase 3F programme 
to provide enhanced defence satellite 
communications services was formally accepted 
by the Commonwealth in November. We will 
continue to provide in-service support to the 
system under a five-year support contract. 
Mobilisation activities for sustainment of the 
Regional F-35 Lightning II fleet continues to 
progress at our Williamtown facility, with an 
increased scope following the announcement 
in August that BAE Systems was assigned the 
role of F-35 Regional Warehouse provider for 
the Asia-Pacific region.
Our existing Hawk Mk127 Lead-in 
Fighter sustainment contracts continue 
to perform strongly. 
The Capability Assurance Programme to 
upgrade the Hawk fleet to meet the training 
requirements of the fifth-generation F-35 
Lightning II is progressing ahead of schedule, 
with 20 of the 33 aircraft modified at the end 
of 2017. During 2017, the Australian Air Force 
customer declared achievement of initial 
operating capability and has commenced 
training with the aircraft.
In June, the Commonwealth announced 
that we have been selected as the preferred 
tenderer for the Jindalee Operational Radar 
Network upgrade programme. If successful, 
the expected value of the contract over the 
initial award term of ten years is approximately 
A$1.0bn (£0.6bn).
Following down-select in 2016 as one of 
two tenderers for the Land 400 Phase 2 
Combat Reconnaissance Vehicle programme, 
we have completed the Risk Mitigation 
Activity contract and submitted our final 
proposal to the Commonwealth in August. 
Customer evaluation is ongoing, with final 
preferred tender selection anticipated in the 
first half of 2018.
Our tender response for the Commonwealth’s 
nine-ship SEA 5000 Future Frigate programme 
was submitted in August. The Commonwealth 
continues to fund Schedule Protection Activity 
to support its evaluation timetable and we 
anticipate a preferred tender selection in the 
first half of 2018.
Oman
The Oman Typhoon and Hawk aircraft 
programme, being undertaken by Platforms 
& Services (UK), completed delivery of the 
first eight Typhoon aircraft and all eight 
Hawk trainer aircraft in 2017. The remaining 
four Typhoon aircraft are scheduled to be 
delivered in 2018.
Separately, we continue to fulfil our legacy 
industrial participation obligations in Oman 
through delivery of an agreed training and 
knowledge transfer programme.
MBDA
In March, MBDA secured a contract from the 
UK and French governments for a three-year 
concept phase of the Future Cruise/Anti-Ship 
Weapon, which will prepare for the 
replacement of the existing missiles deployed 
by the UK and French armed forces. This 
contract follows on from the joint UK-France 
2016 programme for the mid-life refurbishment 
of their current inventory of missiles.
In July, MBDA finalised the financing 
package to secure effectivity of the Qatari 
contracts signed in 2016, which will supply 
air defence systems and anti-ship missiles 
for the naval surface fleet along with coastal 
defence systems.
The German Ministry of Defence and 
MBDA have entered into a formal negotiation 
process for the German ground-based air 
defence system, TLVS, a key element of the 
German defence strategy. Lockheed Martin 
will be the joint venture partner with MBDA 
on this programme.
Significant progress has been made in 
securing positions on a number of fast jet 
platforms. The Meteor Beyond Visual Range 
Air-to-Air Missile is already in operational 
service on Gripen with the Swedish Air Force 
and has now achieved qualification for both 
Typhoon and Rafale aircraft. A contract has 
been received to procure further Brimstone 
missiles to equip Typhoon. Integration of 
MBDA missiles on F-35 Lightning II has 
progressed well, with successful Advanced 
Short Range Air-to-Air Missile qualification 
firings achieved and contracts received from 
the UK to integrate Meteor.
In December, MBDA entered into a contract 
with Qatar for the supply of Brimstone and 
Meteor missiles. The contract is subject to 
financing conditions and receipt by MBDA 
of first payment which are expected to be 
fulfilled no later than mid-2018.
Success in both domestic and export markets 
has significantly increased MBDA’s production 
volumes resulting in the requirement to expand 
production capacities. A new manufacturing 
facility is fully operational in Bolton, UK, and 
a capacity enhancement is under way in 
Bourges, France.

Annual Report 2017
Re-presentation  
of 2017 results Electronic Systems
– High single-digit sales growth is expected 
in 2018 driven by a number of electronic 
warfare contracts with some 70% 
of projected sales in the 2017 closing 
order backlog.
– Margins
1
 are expected to be in a range 
of 14% to 16%.
Cyber & Intelligence
Comprising the US Intelligence & Security 
sector (70% of Cyber & Intelligence sales 
in 2017) and Applied Intelligence:
– In aggregate, sales in 2018 are expected 
to be marginally higher than 2017. Sales 
in Intelligence & Security are expected to 
be largely unchanged, with some growth 
coming from the UK Services and 
International Services & Solutions divisions 
of Applied Intelligence.
– Margins
1
 are expected to improve to 
around 5%. The Intelligence & Security 
business is expected to contribute around 
8% margin, with Applied Intelligence 
moving to an overall break-even position.
Platforms & Services (US)
– Sales growth of 10% to 15% is expected, 
with increasing volumes from the US 
Combat Vehicles and Weapon Systems 
businesses, as well as higher ship repair 
activity. Almost 75% of guidance is in 
the closing order backlog.
– Another year of margin
1
 improvement to 
a range of 9% to 10% is expected in 2018 
absent further charges on the commercial 
shipbuilding contracts.
Air
– Sales are expected to be some 5% 
lower as activity on Typhoon for the 
European, Saudi and Oman contracts 
is largely complete. Around 85% of 
guidance is in the closing order backlog.
– Margins
1
 are expected to be in the 11% 
to 13% range.
Maritime
– Sales are expected to be stable as activity 
levels on Carrier reduce and are largely 
offset by increases on submarine 
programmes. Around 90% of guidance 
is in the closing order backlog.
– Margin
1
 levels are expected to be within 
the 8% to 9% range.
HQ
– HQ costs are expected to be similar  
to 2017.
– Underlying finance costs are expected 
to be around 15% lower, benefiting from 
the weaker US dollar, reduced charges 
arising from our share of equity accounted 
investments and lower net present value 
adjustments.
– The underlying effective tax rate for 2018 
is expected to reduce from 21% to around 
18% benefiting from US tax reform, with 
the final rate dependent on the geographical 
mix of profits.

Guidance  
for 2018 Cyber & Intelligence comprises the 
US-based Intelligence & Security 
business and UK-headquartered 
Applied Intelligence business, and 
covers the Group’s cyber security, 
secure government, and commercial 
and financial security activities.
Intelligence & Security
The outlook for the US government services 
sector is stable, although market conditions 
remain highly competitive and continue 
to evolve.
Whilst the government’s decision not to 
exercise future options on our contract to 
develop a shared IT environment for US 
agencies could impact revenue in 2018, the 
shift in the government’s IT strategy could 
present new opportunities for the business. 
With effect from 12 February 2018, the 
business has restructured to better align with 
its customer base and position the business 
to more effectively compete and grow in 
critical, mission-focused areas with three 
business areas: Integrated Defence Solutions; 
Intelligence Solutions; and Air Force Solutions.
Applied Intelligence
With effect from 1 January 2018, the Applied 
Intelligence business has restructured to focus 
on a more targeted portfolio of products and 
services, delivering for customers within three 
core business units: Government; Financial 
Services; and Technology & Commercial. 
The restructuring will enable a greater focus 
on customer needs and higher levels of 
operational efficiency, in the commercial 
business, that will accelerate improvements 
in competitiveness and profitability.
Sales growth is expected to continue as 
cyber security is an increasingly important 
part of government security and a core 
element of stewardship for commercial 
enterprises in a sophisticated and persistent 
threat environment.
Electronic Systems comprises 
the US and UK-based electronics 
activities, including electronic 
warfare systems, electro-optical 
sensors, military and commercial 
digital engine and flight controls, 
precision guidance and seeker 
solutions, next-generation military 
communications systems and 
data links, persistent surveillance 
capabilities, and hybrid electric 
drive systems.
Electronic Systems is well positioned to address 
current and evolving priority programmes 
from its strong franchise positions in 
electronic warfare, precision guidance and 
seeker solutions. Electronic Systems has a 
long-standing programme of research and 
development, and its focus remains on 
maintaining a diverse portfolio of defence 
and commercial products and capabilities 
for US and international customers.
The business expects to benefit from its 
ability to apply innovative technology solutions 
that meet defence customers’ changing 
requirements. That, along with strong 
programme positions, particularly on F-35 
Lightning II and F-15 upgrades, and specific 
products such as APKWS
™
, position the 
business well for the medium term. 
In the commercial aviation market, Electronic 
Systems’ technology innovations are enabling 
the business to maintain its long-standing 
customer positions and to compete for, 
and win, new business.

Segmental  
looking forward Platforms & Services (US), with 
operations in the US, UK and 
Sweden, manufactures combat 
vehicles, weapons and munitions, 
and delivers services and 
sustainment activities, including 
ship repair and the management 
of government-owned 
munitions facilities.
The land vehicles business is underpinned by 
strong positions on key franchise programmes. 
These include the US Army’s Armored 
Multi-Purpose Vehicle, M109A7 self-propelled 
howitzer and Bradley upgrade programmes, 
and the CV90 and BvS10 export programmes 
from our BAE Systems Hägglunds business.
The business continues to pursue a range 
of domestic and international opportunities 
in combat and amphibious vehicles as well 
as weapon systems.
FNSS has grown its order book with both 
domestic and international orders.
These long-term contracts and our franchise 
position in tracked vehicles, which offer 
opportunities in international markets, make 
the land business well placed for growth in 
the medium term.
In the maritime domain, the Group has a 
strong position on naval gun programmes 
and US Navy ship repair. Additional dry dock 
ship repair capacity has been established in 
San Diego to support the US Navy’s increased 
requirements in the Asia-Pacific region.
The Group remains a leading provider of 
gun systems and precision strike capabilities 
and, in the complex ordnance manufacturing 
business, we continue to manage the 
US Army’s Radford and Holston munitions 
facilities under long-term contracts.
Air comprises the Group’s UK-based 
air activities for European and 
International markets and US 
Programmes and its businesses in 
Saudi Arabia and Australia, together 
with its 37 .5% interest in the 
pan-European MBDA joint venture.
In the UK, as current export contracts for 
Typhoon and Hawk complete, and UK 
Tornado support ends, sales are underpinned 
by our workshare on Typhoon for Kuwait, 
Typhoon and Hawk support, and F-35 
Lightning II production and support. UK-based 
production of rear fuselage assemblies for 
F-35 Lightning II will increase over the next 
three years to reach its expected peak rate 
for the next decade. We play a significant 
role in the F-35 Lightning II sustainment 
programme in support of Lockheed Martin.
Discussions continue with current and 
prospective operators on contract awards 
for Typhoon and Hawk, and we continue 
to develop long-standing international 
partnerships in the air domain, maintaining 
our skills and capabilities.
The UK and Saudi support operations are 
underpinned by long-term contracts. In Saudi 
Arabia, the In-Kingdom Industrial Participation 
programme continues to make good progress 
consistent with our long-term strategy, as well 
as the Saudi Arabian government’s National 
Transformation Plan and Vision 2030.
In Australia, the business is structured 
around long-term sustainment and upgrade 
activities, and we are progressing significant 
opportunities with the Australian government 
in the maritime and land domains. 
MBDA has a strong order book which is 
driving increasing production and sales. 
Development programmes continue to 
improve the long-term capabilities of 
the business.
Maritime comprises the 
Group’s UK-based maritime 
and land activities.
Maritime
In Maritime, there remains pressure on 
the Navy’s near-term budgets and a 
highly-competitive environment in ship 
support and upgrade.
Within submarines, the business is executing 
on the Astute Class programme, with four 
boats still in build. On the Dreadnought 
programme, production on the first boat 
of four commenced in 2016. Investment 
continues in the Barrow facilities to provide 
the capability on these long-term 
programmes through the next decade.
In shipbuilding, sales are underpinned by the 
contracts to manufacture the Queen Elizabeth 
Class aircraft carriers, Type 26 frigates and 
River Class Offshore Patrol Vessels. 
The through-life support of surface ship 
platforms provides a sustainable business 
in technical services and mid-life upgrades.
Land UK
The Land UK business continues to deliver 
support to armoured vehicle and bridging 
systems in UK and international markets, 
munitions under the 15-year Munitions 
Acquisition Supply Solution partnering 
agreement secured in 2008 and 40mm

Whilst we continue to operate under a Continuing Resolution, the bipartisan budget agreement passed on 9 February 2018 
would increase the US defence budget by approximately 10% over current levels, reflecting continued growth in defence spending 
to $700bn (£518bn) for the fiscal year ending 30 September 2018. This budget agreement increases the budget caps for two years 
and extends the Continuing Resolution to 23 March 2018 to allow lawmakers to pass a 2018 spending bill.

Strategic report Governance Financial statements Corporate responsibility in action
Launch of the revised 
Code of Conduct
We regularly review and update our 
Code of Conduct to ensure that it reflects 
best practice, emerging issues and new 
regulations. This was done in 2017 and 
the revised Code of Conduct was launched 
in January 2018. As part of the revision 
process, the Code of Conduct was 
externally benchmarked with two 
organisations, the Institute of Business 
Ethics and the Corporate Executive Board. 
Further review was conducted by internal 
consultation and collaboration across 
the Group, including trade union 
representatives. The final version was 
approved by the Board in December.
The Board delegates the detailed oversight 
of corporate responsibility matters to the 
Corporate Responsibility Committee, 
which is chaired by a non-executive 
director (see page 87). The Corporate 
Responsibility Committee meets as 
part of the Board’s annual schedule of 
meetings (see page 80), and agrees the 
Group’s responsible business priorities 
relating to our employees, trust and 
integrity, health and safety, and 
resource efficiency. 
The Chief Executive is responsible for 
ensuring we meet our own standards 
and the expectations of our stakeholders. 
He is supported by the Managing Director 
Operational Governance with guidance 
and oversight from the Board via the 
Corporate Responsibility Committee. 
The performance review process is used 
to flow down corporate responsibility 
objectives through the Company. 
For information on how our business 
model is underpinned by our commitment 
to corporate responsibility, see page 23.
Our Operational Framework (see page 76) 
sets out the way we do business. We set 
Group-wide policies, which are enacted 
at a local level by our businesses, and help 
business leadership to make informed 
decisions about the business opportunities 
we pursue. 
The Operational Framework is reviewed 
and approved by the Board each year. 
The twice-yearly Operational Assurance 
Statement (OAS) process is used to 
monitor compliance with the Operational 
Framework. The Internal Audit Director 
owns the OAS Policy, and is responsible 
for the consolidation and reporting of the 
OAS submissions from the businesses to 
the Group Audit Review Board, the Audit 
Committee and the Corporate Responsibility 
Committee. The Internal Audit Director 
reports functionally to the Audit Committee 
and, for day-to-day operations, to the Chief 
Executive. The Corporate Responsibility 
and Audit Committees hold a joint meeting 
each year to review the OAS and assurance 
matters as both committees are concerned 
with both financial and non-financial risk.
Corporate responsibility is a key enabler for our business, 
supporting sustainable long-term performance by 
managing non-financial risks that can impact reputation 
and shareholder value.

Corporate  
responsibility Our corporate responsibility programmes 
focus on:
– developing an inclusive, diverse workplace 
to drive innovation and performance, and 
engaging with the communities in which 
we operate (see page 24);
– supporting our employees in making the 
right decisions (see below);
– continuously improving employee wellbeing 
and standards of safety for employees and 
those we work with (see page 63); and
– managing the environmental impacts of 
our facilities and products (see page 64).
Trust and integrity
We aim to be a recognised leader in business 
conduct. This helps us to earn and maintain 
stakeholder trust and sustain business 
success.
We consider it fundamental to maintain a 
culture focused on embedding responsible 
business behaviours. All employees are 
expected to act in accordance with the 
requirements of the Company’s policies, 
including the Code of Conduct, at all times. 
As well as being the right thing to do, this 
reduces the risk of compliance failure and 
supports us in attracting and retaining 
high-calibre employees. Our principal risks 
include risks relating to laws and regulations, 
and our people (see pages 70 and 71, 
respectively). 
We work to build a culture where our people 
are empowered to make the right decisions 
and know where to go to seek help or 
guidance. Our Code of Conduct sets out 
clear expectations on ethical conduct and 
we offer training and support to help people 
understand the right thing to do.
During 2017, we rolled out face-to-face 
ethics training that covered realistic, issue-
based scenarios. This training, delivered by 
line managers to their teams across the Group, 
was designed to stimulate conversations 
around difficult issues faced by employees in 
their workplace. Certain employees received 
additional training according to their role, 
such as anti-corruption training.
Employees can speak up via our network 
of over 160 Ethics Officers or by contacting 
our 24-hour Ethics Helpline by phone, e-mail 
or an external website to ask for support or 
report concerns, anonymously if preferred.
We collect data on ethics enquiries and 
dismissals for reasons relating to unethical 
behaviour (see opposite). In 2017, there 
were 1,280
1
 ethics enquiries, an increase 
of 14% on 2016. This positive trend reflects 
our efforts to encourage people to speak up 
and we will continue to communicate to our 
employees the methods of making contact. 
Our 2017 anonymity rate of 24% compares 
favourably with international benchmarks.
In 2017, 53% of the ethics enquiries received 
were requests for guidance and advice, 
which we believe reflects our employees 
coming to us before a situation has worsened 
and requires investigation. We encourage 
employees to contact us as early as possible 
when a potential incident can still be 
prevented by timely advice.
All ethics enquiries reported which required 
investigation were reviewed and reported 
either to the Ethics Review Committee or, 
in BAE Systems, Inc., to the Ethics Review 
Oversight Committee.

Strategic report Governance Financial statements Anti-bribery and anti-corruption
We have well-established anti-bribery and 
anti-corruption policies aimed at ensuring 
adherence to the associated legal and 
regulatory requirements. Our commitment 
to comply with all applicable laws and 
regulations, including those addressing 
anti-bribery and anti-corruption, and our 
commitment never to offer, give or receive 
bribes or inducements is also clearly set out 
in the Code of Conduct. 
The policies referred to above include the 
following:
– Advisers Policy – which governs the 
appointment, management and payment 
of third parties who are engaged to assist 
with our sales and marketing activities; 
– Gifts and Hospitality Policy – which 
governs the reasonableness and 
proportionality of offering or receipt 
of gifts or hospitality; 
– Conflict of Interest Policy – designed 
to ensure that personal conflicts of interest 
do not impair employees’ judgement and 
damage the Company’s integrity and 
interests; and 
– Facilitation Payments Policy – designed 
to ensure that the Company and its 
employees seek to eliminate the practice 
of facilitation payments.
Other policies, including our Export Control 
Policy, Lobbying Policy and Offset Policy, 
include measures to address bribery and 
corruption risks. 
An outcome of these policies is our extensive 
due diligence procedures implemented to 
address the issues mentioned above. In 
particular, the Advisers Policy requires that 
intermediaries who are engaged to assist with 
our sales and marketing activities are approved 
via procedures which include appropriate 
internal and external due diligence and 
authorisation. Sales and marketing advisers 
with whom the Company has an ongoing 
relationship go through this process every 
two years.
For the principal risks relating to compliance 
with anti-bribery and anti-corruption 
regulations and how the risk is mitigated, 
see the laws and regulations risk description 
on page 70.
Suppliers
We work with suppliers and their supply 
chains to provide fully compliant, cost-
effective equipment, goods, services and 
solutions. Our supplier relationships are often 
long term due to the length of our product 
lifecycles, so we aim to work with suppliers 
who share our values and who embrace 
standards of ethical behaviour consistent 
with our own.
Our policy is to identify and select suppliers 
who meet our standards, and support them 
by managing risks throughout the lifecycle 
of any commercial arrangement. We manage 
risk with our suppliers in accordance with our 
Procurement Policy, our Lifecycle Management 
Framework and our Supplier Principles. Our 
business leaders and the Global Procurement 
Council oversee compliance with the policies 
and principles. Our procurement teams 
assess suppliers against anti-bribery 
and anti-corruption criteria.
After selection, we continue to engage with 
our suppliers for ongoing assurance at all 
stages of a project. Our key supplier and 
procurement policies are compliant with 
national and international laws. In 2017, 
we reconfirmed our commitment to the 
enhanced UK Government Prompt Payment 
Code and were one of the inaugural 
signatories to the Australian Small Business 
Supplier Payment Code.
Human rights
We are committed to respecting human 
rights. This applies equally to our employees, 
our suppliers and business partners, all of 
whom are expected to adopt the same or 
similarly high standards of ethical behaviour. 
We are committed to conducting business 
responsibly and to maintaining and improving 
systems and processes to reduce the risk of 
slavery or human trafficking in our business 
or supply chain.
Our Code of Conduct and other global 
policies and processes mandated under the 
Operational Framework, together with our 
supporting principles and guidance on 
responsible trading and suppliers, support 
our commitment to human rights. This results, 
for example, in due diligence being carried out 
during the supplier evaluation stage against 
non-financial risks, including human rights, 
working hours, harassment and unlawful 
discrimination, anti-whistleblowing, slavery, 
human trafficking and child labour.
Suppliers are regularly reviewed throughout 
their contractual relationships against such 
non-financial risks. In 2017, we published our 
response to the UK Modern Slavery Act and 
a statement in response to the California 
Transparency in Supply Chain Act on our 
website, baesystems.com.
Working with others
We continue to work with peers across 
the defence industry to improve ethical 
standards. During 2017, we continued to 
participate in the International Forum on 
Business Ethical Conduct’s Council and 
worked with the Institute of Business Ethics 
to set up a UK Defence Practitioners Group. 
This group met several times in 2017 to share 
experiences and best practice on ethical 
issues of particular concern to the industry 
and to receive expert briefings. 
2018 priorities
We will roll out the revised Code of 
Conduct to all employees. Managers will 
distribute the Code of Conduct to their 
direct reports alongside face-to-face, 
scenario-based training. This forms part 
of our continuing efforts to build a culture 
of responsible behaviour and ethical 
decision-making.

Corporate responsibility 
continued Health and safety 
Our collective focus on employee wellbeing 
and the health and safety of employees and 
those who work on, or visit, our sites is a 
contributory factor to the success of our 
organisation. Our safety culture and our 
employees demand high standards for all 
aspects of health and safety. This is supported 
both by our mandated Health and Safety 
Policy and the principles contained within 
our Code of Conduct for employees. 
Employee wellbeing
We promote wellbeing through a wide variety 
of programmes, ranging from exercise and 
fitness promotion to occupational health 
checks. We know that good mental and 
physical health contributes to better decision-
making, greater productivity and higher levels 
of employee satisfaction. We run campaigns 
to encourage employees to take responsibility 
for their health problems, such as heart 
disease, diabetes and cancer. Our Employee 
Assistance Programme is a confidential service 
available to employees and includes support 
and advice on personal matters. 
Safety
Our business is highly complex and our 
employees are exposed to many risks. These 
range from slips, trips and falls in an office 
environment, confined space working and 
machinery hazards within manufacturing to 
fire and explosion risks associated with the 
manufacture and storage of munitions. Many 
of our employees operate heavy equipment, 
work at height or do physically demanding 
work in high-risk environments.
In order to ensure consistency, all businesses 
are required to comply with our Health and 
Safety Policy, which outlines and prescribes 
the responsibilities and arrangements in place 
for ensuring safety. It is the responsibility of 
individual business leaders to ensure that their 
organisations comply with the policy. We aim 
to mitigate or manage safety risks by finding 
new ways to enhance safety standards, 
increase awareness and continually drive 
a strong safety culture.
Due to the varied risk profiles and work 
environments within the Group, we operate 
safety management systems within each 
business, many of which are externally 
accredited to the OHSAS
1
 18001 standard. 
These systems identify and control risk, 
and are used to assure that processes and 
procedures are protecting our people and 
others who may be affected by our 
operations. Teams of safety specialists assist 
management in ensuring safety management 
systems are effective and that operational 
control of risk is maintained. Health and 
safety specialists provide expert advice and 
tools to put our safety policies into practice. 
Some employees may be exposed to 
long-term health risks from hazardous 
substances and other physical hazards. 
We aim to reduce exposure levels to 
hazardous substances and to seek alternatives, 
where possible. We provide our employees 
with health surveillance to understand and 
reduce the impact of workplace health risks.
We use the Recordable Accident Rate as 
a key performance indicator to measure 
workplace injuries. This metric, along with 
the number of major injuries, is used to 
determine an element of executive bonus 
(see page 101). In 2017, there was a 3% 
reduction in the Recordable Accident Rate, 
a 28% reduction in the total number of 
major injuries recorded and no fatalities as 
we continued to focus on reducing risk and 
embedding safety culture to drive improvement. 
2018 priorities
We will continue to drive towards a

Strategic report Governance Financial statements Resource efficiency
Resource efficiency is an important measure of 
business effectiveness for us and is embedded 
within our Environmental Policy. As a major 
manufacturer, our operations have an impact 
on the environment – from the energy and 
resources we use to the products we 
manufacture and the waste we generate. 
We are committed to minimising the risk 
of environmental impact of our operations 
and products, reducing our environmental 
footprint and, in turn, decreasing our 
operational costs. In line with the 
Environmental Policy, our businesses and 
operational sites devise their own ways of 
addressing their environmental priorities, 
given the diverse geographic and sectoral 
spread of our business.
Alongside the policy, the revised Code 
of Conduct supports our commitment 
to environmental management – every 
employee is to contribute to the efficient 
use of resources and compliance with 
environmental practices and policies. 
An outcome of our Environmental Policy is 
that ongoing environmental performance 
is reported to our senior management team 
through Quarterly Business Reviews and 
adherence to our Environmental Policy is 
monitored by the environmental teams in 
our businesses via the Operational Assurance 
Statement process. 
Our businesses set annual environmental and 
resource efficiency targets. Whilst the priorities 
and targets differ locally, our businesses are 
tackling resource efficiency challenges that 
are global in nature, chiefly materials resilience, 
energy and climate change, and waste, 
emissions and discharges.
Materials resilience
Where applicable, we adapt our materials 
management and use according to regulations 
as they are implemented. We have an 
overall aim to reduce the hazardous materials 
used at our sites during the manufacture of 
our products. 
Corporate responsibility in action
Growth of our 
hybrid-electric 
transport systems
To date, we have over 8,000 hybrid-
electric systems in service on buses from 
London to California. Each year, these 
buses transport over one billion passengers, 
whilst saving 17 million gallons of fuel and 
eliminating 170,000 tonnes of CO 2 from 
entering the atmosphere. 
Using BAE Systems’ hybrid and electric 
systems, transit bus agencies around the 
world are taking initiatives to clean up 
their cities and provide sustainable, quieter 
options for public transportation. In 
alignment with these initiatives, we have 
introduced a next-generation hybrid, our 
Series-ER, which extends the electric driving 
range, and have brought to market a new 
energy storage system and direct drive motor 
to compete in our European markets. We are 
prepared to respond to market demand for 
zero-emissions with our Series-EV technology, 
including a full-battery electric solution and 
our hydrogen fuel cell technology solution. 
We have taken our proven, green bus 
technology to the water with the 
introduction of three hybrid and electric 
solutions: HybriGen
®
 provides hybrid power 
for boat accessories and cleaner, quieter 
vessel propulsion; HybriGen
®
 Zero addresses 
the inland towboat market with hybrid 
power, saving fuel, space and maintenance 
costs; and Hybrid Assist uses a parallel hybrid 
configuration to drive a vessel on electric 
power at low speeds with a boost of power 
for high speeds when required.

Methodology
The greenhouse gas emissions data is reported in line with the 
Greenhouse Gas Protocol Corporate Accounting and Reporting 
Standard ‘Operational Control’ approach, and emission factors 
for fuels and electricity are published at www.gov.uk/government/ 
collections/conversion-factors-for-company-reporting.
The CO 2 e associated with carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous 
oxide is reported. Greenhouse gas emissions associated with 
hydrofluorocarbons, perfluorocarbons and sulphur hexafluoride 
are estimated to be immaterial to total emissions and are, 
therefore, not reported.
The principal record of the Group’s worldwide facilities is its 
legal department’s Global Property Database.
Greenhouse gas emissions are primarily calculated from 
energy consumption records reported via the Group’s global 
environmental database. Where actual usage data is not 
available for facilities and residences within the Global Property 
Database, an estimated consumption is used based on the type 
of building.
Greenhouse gas emissions related to business travel include air 
travel data for the majority of the global business and rail data 
for business units operating in the UK and US. These data are 
taken from travel suppliers’ procurement records.
Emissions from joint ventures and pension scheme properties 
not occupied by the Group are not included. Where a business 
or facility is acquired during a reporting year, it will be included 
in our reporting in the next full reporting year after the change.
The Scope 2 greenhouse gas emissions associated with the 
Greenhouse Gas Protocol ‘market-based’ method have been 
calculated as 592,745 tonnes CO 2 e. Supplier-specific emission 
factors have been sought for our most significant operating 
regions, but were either deemed of insufficient quality to use 
at present or were unavailable. Therefore, in line with the 
Greenhouse Gas Protocol guidance, this figure has been 
calculated using residual-mix emission factors where available 
for our UK and US operations. In our other significant operating 
regions, residual-mix emission factors are either unavailable or 
the resulting absolute emissions at Group level are within the 
margin of error and, therefore, the latter has been used.
1. See summary of Deloitte LLP assurance opposite.
2. Excluding share of equity accounted investments.
Energy and climate change
We are improving energy efficiency and 
de-carbonising our energy supply to reduce 
greenhouse gas emissions. The nature of 
our business, with large-scale projects and 
fluctuations in orders, makes it challenging to 
set a Group-wide emissions reduction target. 
Energy targets are set at business level and 
contribute to an overall energy reduction 
target for the Group.
We collect data on greenhouse gas emissions. 
The Group’s total greenhouse gas emissions 
have decreased by 8% in the 12 months to 
31 October 2017. 
Our largest 20 sites accounted for 83% of 
our greenhouse gas emissions on average 
over 2014 to 2016. Of these sites, 18 are 
certified to ISO 14001 and the other two 
have an environmental management system 
in place. In line with these environmental 
management systems, the top 20 sites are 
actively aiming to reduce the emissions 
they produce. 
Waste, emissions and discharges 
Targets to reduce waste, emissions and 
discharges are set by each business reflecting 
the scale and maturity of their facilities and 
the nature of their activities. The efficient 
use of resources and a decrease in waste 
produced reduces our environmental 
footprint and provides cost-saving benefits 
for the organisation. 
We use our engineering expertise to improve 
resource efficiency and make our products 
more sustainable. We work to reduce 
environmental impacts at every stage of 
their lifecycle – from concept, design and 
manufacture through to use and disposal.
2018 priorities
We will continue to drive improvements 
in the management of materials and 
resources across all businesses.

Annual Report 2017
Strategic report Governance Financial statements Effective management of risks and opportunities is essential 
to the delivery of the Group’s strategic objectives and the 
creation of sustainable shareholder value.
Board
The Board has overall responsibility for 
determining the nature and extent of the risk 
it is willing to take, and ensuring that risks are 
managed effectively across the Group.
Risk is a regular agenda item at Board meetings 
and the Board reviews risk as part of its annual 
strategy review process. This provides the 
Board with an appreciation of the key risks 
within the business and oversight of how 
they are being managed.
The Board delegates oversight of certain 
risk management activities to the Audit 
and Corporate Responsibility committees 
as follows:
Audit Committee
The Audit Committee monitors the Group’s 
key risks identified by the risk assessment 
processes and reports its findings to the Board 
twice a year. It is also responsible for reviewing 
in detail the effectiveness of the Group’s 
system of internal control policies, and 
procedures for the identification, assessment 
and reporting of risk.
Corporate Responsibility Committee
The Corporate Responsibility Committee 
monitors the Group’s performance in managing 
the Group’s significant non-financial risks, 
including those arising in respect of business 
conduct, health and safety, and the 
environment. The Committee reports its 
findings to the Board on a regular basis.
Approach
The Group’s Risk Management Policy is 
set out in the Operational Framework, the 
Group’s detailed governance framework.
The Group’s approach to risk management 
is aimed at the early identification of key risks, 
mitigating the effect of those risks before 
they occur and dealing with them effectively 
if they crystallise.
The Group is committed to the protection 
of its assets, which include human resources, 
intellectual and physical property, and 
financial resources, through an effective risk 
management process, underpinned where 
appropriate by insurance.
Reporting within the Group is structured 
so that key issues are escalated through 
the management team and ultimately to 
the Board where appropriate. The underlying 
principles of the Group’s risk management 
processes are that risks are monitored 
continuously, associated action plans reviewed, 
appropriate contingencies provisioned and 
this information reported through established 
management control procedures.
The Board has conducted a review of the 
effectiveness of the Group’s systems of risk 
management and internal control processes, 
including financial, operational and compliance 
controls and risk management systems, in 
accordance with the UK Corporate Governance 
Code. The Company has developed a system 
of internal controls that was in place throughout 
2017 and to the date of this report.
As with any system of internal control, the 
policies and processes that are mandated in 
the Operational Framework are designed to 
manage rather than eliminate the risk of failure 
to achieve business objectives and can only 
provide reasonable, and not absolute, assurance 
against material misstatement or loss.
Financial and non-financial risks
Financial risks expose the Group to potential 
costs which are quantifiable on the basis 
that their probability and impact can be 
understood adequately and related to the 
financial statements.
Non-financial risks cannot be assessed readily 
in financial terms and, therefore, cannot be 
reflected reliably in the financial statements.
Process
Businesses
The responsibility for risk identification, 
analysis, evaluation and mitigation rests 
with the line management of the businesses. 
They are also responsible for reporting and 
monitoring key risks in accordance with 
established processes under the Group’s 
Operational Framework.
The Group’s risk management process is set 
out in the Risk Management Policy, a mandated 
policy under the Operational Framework, 
and, in respect of projects, in the Lifecycle 
Management Framework, a core business 
process under the Operational Framework. 
Further guidance is provided by a Risk 
Management Maturity self-assessment tool.
Identified risks are documented in risk 
registers showing: the risks that have been 
identified; characteristics of the risk; the basis 
for determining mitigation strategy; and 
what reviews and monitoring are necessary. 
Each risk is allocated an owner who has 
authority and responsibility for assessing 
and managing it.
Project risks are reported and monitored in 
Group-mandated format Contract Review 
Packs, which are reviewed by management 
at monthly Contract Reviews. The financial 
performance of projects is reported and 
monitored using Contract Status Reports, 
which form part of the Contract Review Pack. 
These include programme margin metrics, 
which are reviewed regularly by the Executive 
Committee and Board. Project margin is 
recognised after making suitable allowances 
for technical and other risks related to 
performance milestones yet to be achieved.
In addition, every six months, the businesses 
complete an Operational Assurance Statement 
(OAS), which is a mandated policy under the 
Operational Framework. The OAS is in two 
parts: a self-assessment of compliance with 
the Operational Framework; and a report 
showing the key financial and non-financial 
risks for the relevant business. Together with 
reviews undertaken by Internal Audit and 
the work of the external auditors, the OAS 
forms the Group’s process for reviewing the 
effectiveness of the system of internal controls.
Executive Committee
The key financial and non-financial risks 
identified by the businesses from the risk 
assessment processes are collated and reviewed 
by the Executive Committee to identify those 
issues where the cumulative risk, or possible 
reputational impacts, could be significant.
Management responsibility for the management 
of the Group’s most significant non-financial 
risks is determined by the Executive Committee. 
The OAS and non-financial risk registers are 
reviewed regularly by the Executive Committee 
to monitor the status and progression of 
mitigation plans, and these key risks are 
reported to the Board on a regular basis.
Principal risks
The Board has carried out a robust assessment 
of the principal risks facing the Company, 
including those that would threaten its 
business model, future performance, solvency 
and liquidity. Such risks have been identified 
as principal based on the likelihood of 
occurrence and the potential impact on the 
Group, and have been identified through the 
application of the policies and processes 
outlined above. These risks, together with 
details of how they are being mitigated and 
managed, are detailed on pages 68 to 71.

1. Defence spending
The Group is dependent on defence spending.
In 2017, 92% of the Group’s sales were 
defence-related.
Defence spending by governments can fluctuate 
depending on change of government policy, 
other political considerations, budgetary 
constraints, specific threats and movements 
in the international oil price.
There have been constraints on government 
expenditure in a number of the Group’s principal 
markets, in particular in the US and UK. A National 
Security Capability Review is being undertaken by 
the Cabinet Office, and a Modernising Defence 
Programme was announced in January 2018 by 
the Defence Secretary. The outcome of both is 
aimed to be announced by the summer of 2018.
The result of the EU referendum in the UK has 
led to a period of uncertainty and, in the longer 
term, there is a risk relating to the Group’s ability 
to participate in further collaborative defence 
programmes in Europe.
Lower defence spending by the 
Group’s major customers could 
have a material adverse effect 
on the Group’s future results 
and financial condition.
The business is geographically spread across US, UK and 
international defence markets:
– In the US, after seven months under a Continuing Resolution 
that maintained funding at the prior year’s level, the fiscal 
year 2017 defence budget ultimately rose by approximately 
4%. Whilst the fiscal year 2018 budget remains under a 
Continuing Resolution, the bipartisan budget agreement 
passed on 9 February 2018 would increase the US defence 
budget by approximately 10% over current levels, reflecting 
continued growth in defence spending to $700bn (£518bn) 
for the fiscal year ending 30 September 2018. This budget 
agreement increases the budget caps for two years and 
extends the Continuing Resolution to 23 March 2018 to allow 
lawmakers to pass a 2018 spending bill. The US business has 
become adept at managing through Continuing Resolutions 
and brief government shutdowns, mitigating any short-term 
interruptions across our portfolio. 
– The UK is Europe’s largest defence market and, after a 
period of budgetary decline, defence spending has stabilised. 
The 2017 Spring Budget reinforced previous commitments 
to increase defence spending, as well as the continued 
pledge to maintain spending at 2% of GDP. 
– In Saudi Arabia, regional tensions continue to dictate that 
defence remains a high priority.
The diverse product and services portfolio is marketed across 
a range of defence markets. BAE Systems benefits from a large 
order backlog, with established positions on long-term 
programmes in the US, UK, Saudi Arabia and Australia.
BAE Systems has a growing portfolio of commercial businesses, 
including commercial avionics and the commercial areas of the 
Applied Intelligence business.
We will support the government in achieving its aim to ensure 
that the UK maintains its key role in European security and 
defence post-Brexit, and to strengthen bilateral relationships 
with key partners in Europe. This will be important for ongoing 
collaboration in the development of defence capabilities.
2. Government customers
The Group’s largest customers are governments.
The Group has long-standing relationships 
and security arrangements with a number of 
its government customers, including its three 
largest customers, the governments of the 
US, UK and Saudi Arabia, and their agencies. 
It is important that these relationships and 
arrangements are maintained.
In the defence and security industries, 
governments can typically modify contracts 
for their convenience or terminate them at 
short notice. Long-term US government 
contracts, for example, are funded annually 
and are subject to cancellation if funding 
appropriations for subsequent periods are 
not made. Governments also from time to 
time review their terms of trade and underlying 
policies and seek to impose such new terms 
and policies when entering into new contracts.
The Group’s performance on its contracts 
with some government customers is subject 
to financial audits and other reviews which 
can result in adjustments to prices and costs.
Deterioration in the Group’s principal 
government relationships resulting 
in the failure to obtain contracts or 
expected funding appropriations, 
adverse changes in the terms of its 
arrangements with those customers 
or their agencies, or the termination 
of contracts could have a material 
adverse effect on the Group’s future 
results and financial condition.
Government customers have sophisticated procurement 
and security organisations with which the Group can have 
long-standing relationships with well-established and 
understood terms of business.
In the event of a customer terminating a contract for 
convenience, the Group would typically be paid for work 
done and commitments made at the time of termination.
Risks are identified based on the likelihood of occurrence 
and the potential impact on the Group. The Group’s 
principal risks are identified below, together with a 
description of how we mitigate those risks.

Our principal  
risks Description Impact Mitigation
3. International markets
The Group operates in international markets.
BAE Systems is an international company 
conducting business in a number of regions, 
including the US and the Middle East.
The risks of operating in some countries include: 
social and political changes impacting the 
business environment; economic downturns, 
political instability and civil disturbances; the 
imposition of restraints on the movement of 
capital; the introduction of burdensome taxes 
or tariffs; change of government policy and 
regulations in the UK, US and all other relevant 
jurisdictions; and the inability to obtain or 
maintain the necessary export licences.
The Group is exposed to volatility arising 
from movements in currency exchange rates, 
particularly in respect of the US dollar, euro, 
Saudi riyal and Australian dollar. There has 
been volatility in currency exchange rates in 
the period since the EU referendum in the UK.
In July 2017, the High Court of England and Wales 
ruled that the UK government has been acting 
lawfully in granting defence export licences to 
the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. The Court of 
Appeal is currently considering whether to 
permit an appeal of the High Court’s decision.
The occurrence of any such events 
could have a material adverse effect 
on the Group’s future results and 
financial condition.
The Group has a balanced portfolio of businesses across a 
number of markets internationally. The Group benefits from 
a large order backlog, with established positions on long-term 
programmes in the US, UK, Saudi Arabia and Australia.
The Group’s policy is to hedge all material firm transactional 
currency exchange rate exposures.
The Group’s contracts are often long-term in nature and, 
consequently, it may be able to mitigate these risks over 
the terms of those contracts.
Political risk insurance is held in respect of export contracts 
not structured on a government-to-government basis.
BAE Systems has a well-established legal and regulatory 
compliance structure aimed at ensuring adherence to 
regulatory requirements and identifying restrictions that 
could adversely impact the Group’s activities, including 
export control requirements.
4. Competition in international markets
The Group’s business is subject to significant competition in international markets.
The Group’s business plan depends upon 
its ability to win and contract for high-quality 
new programmes, an increasing number of 
which are expected to be in markets outside 
the US and UK.
The Group is dependent upon US and UK 
government support in relation to a number 
of its business opportunities in export markets.
The Group’s business and future 
results may be adversely impacted 
if it is unable to compete adequately 
and obtain new business in the 
markets in which it operates.
The Group has an international, multi-market presence, 
a balanced portfolio of businesses, leading capabilities 
and a track record of delivery on its commitments to 
its customers.
The Group continues to invest in research and development, 
and to reduce its cost base and improve efficiencies, to 
remain competitive.
In the UK, export contracts can be structured on a 
government-to-government basis and government support 
can also involve military training, ministerial support for 
promotional activities and financial support through UK 
Export Finance. In the US, most of the Group’s defence 
export sales are delivered through the Foreign Military Sales 
process, under which the importing government contracts 
with the US government.

BAE Systems
Annual Report 2017
Strategic report Governance Financial statements Description Impact Mitigation
5. Laws and regulations
The Group is subject to risk from a failure to comply with laws and regulations.
The Group operates in a highly-regulated 
environment across many jurisdictions and 
is subject, without limitation, to regulations 
relating to import-export controls, money 
laundering, false accounting, anti-bribery 
and anti-boycott provisions. It is important that 
the Group maintains a culture in which it focuses 
on embedding responsible business behaviours 
and that all employees act in accordance with 
the requirements of the Group’s policies, 
including the Code of Conduct, at all times. 
Export restrictions could become more 
stringent and political factors or changing 
international circumstances could result in 
the Group being unable to obtain or maintain 
necessary export licences.
Failure by the Group, or its sales 
representatives, marketing advisers 
or others acting on its behalf, to 
comply with these regulations could 
result in fines and penalties and/or 
the suspension or debarment of the 
Group from government contracts 
or the suspension of the Group’s 
export privileges, which could 
have a material adverse effect 
on the Group.
Reduced access to export markets 
could have a material adverse effect 
on the Group’s future results and 
financial condition.
BAE Systems has a well-established legal and regulatory 
compliance structure aimed at ensuring adherence to regulatory 
requirements and identifying restrictions that could adversely 
impact the Group’s activities.
Internal and external market risk assessments form an 
important element of ongoing corporate development 
and training processes.
A uniform global policy and process for the appointment 
of advisers engaged in business development is in effect.
BAE Systems continues to reinforce its ethics programme globally, 
driving the right behaviours by supporting employees in making 
ethical decisions and embedding responsible business practices.
The special compliance officer, appointed pursuant to 
commitments concerning ongoing regulatory compliance made 
in the course of the 2011 settlement with the US Department 
of State, concluded his monitorship in May 2014 and, at the 
invitation of BAE Systems, agreed to remain in a limited capacity 
for a limited further period of time.
6. Contract risk and execution
The Group has many contracts, including a small number of large contracts and fixed-price contracts.
In 2017, 47% of the Group’s sales were generated 
by its 15 largest programmes. At 31 December 
2017, the Group had five programmes with order 
backlog in excess of £1bn.
A significant portion of the Group’s revenue is 
derived from fixed-price contracts. Actual costs 
may exceed the projected costs on which the 
fixed prices are agreed and, since these contracts 
can extend over many years, it can be difficult 
to predict the ultimate outturn costs.
It is important that the Group maintains a culture 
in which it delivers on its projects within tight 
tolerances of quality, time and cost performance 
in a reliable, predictable and repeatable manner.
The inability of the Group 
to deliver on its contractual 
commitments, the loss, expiration, 
suspension, cancellation or 
termination of any one of its large 
contracts or its failure to anticipate 
technical problems or estimate 
accurately and control costs on 
fixed-price contracts could have 
a material adverse effect on the 
Group’s future results and 
financial condition.
Contract-related risks and uncertainties are managed under 
the Group’s mandated Lifecycle Management process.
A leadership development programme for project directors 
has been deployed across the Group, covering the leadership 
competencies required to manage complex projects containing 
significant levels of risk and uncertainty.
A significant proportion of the Group’s largest contracts are 
with the UK Ministry of Defence. In the UK, development 
programmes are normally contracted with appropriate levels of 
risk being initially held by the customer and contract structures 
are used to mitigate risk on production programmes, including 
where the customer and contractor share cost savings and 
overruns against target prices.
The Group has a well-balanced spread of programmes and 
significant order backlog which provides forward visibility.
The Group has limited exposure to fixed-price design and 
development activity which is in general more risk intensive 
than fixed-price production activity.
Robust bid preparation and approvals processes are well 
established throughout the Group, with decisions required to 
be taken at the appropriate level in line with clear delegations 
of authority.
7. Contract awards and cash profiles
The Group is dependent on the award timing and cash profile of its contracts.
The Group’s profits and cash flows are 
dependent, to a significant extent, on the 
timing of, or failure to receive, award of 
defence contracts and the profile of cash 
receipts on its contracts.
Amounts receivable under the 
Group’s defence contracts can 
be substantial and, therefore, the 
timing of, or failure to receive, awards 
and associated cash advances and 
milestone payments could materially 
affect the Group’s profits and cash 
flows for the periods affected, 
thereby reducing cash available to 
meet the Group’s cash allocation 
priorities, potentially resulting in 
the need to arrange external funding 
and impacting its investment grade 
credit rating.
The Group’s balance sheet continues to be managed 
conservatively in line with its policy to retain an investment 
grade credit rating and to ensure operating flexibility.
The Group monitors a rolling forecast of its liquidity 
requirements to ensure that there is sufficient cash to meet 
its operational needs and maintain adequate headroom.

Our principal risks 
continued Description Impact Mitigation
8. Pension funding
The Group has an aggregate funding deficit in its defined benefit pension schemes.
In aggregate, there is an actuarial deficit 
between the value of the projected liabilities 
of the Group’s defined benefit pension 
schemes and the assets they hold.
The funding deficits may be adversely affected 
by changes in a number of factors, including 
investment returns and anticipated members’ 
longevity.
Increases in pension scheme 
deficits may require the Group 
to increase the amount of cash 
contributions payable to these 
schemes, thereby reducing cash 
available to meet the Group’s 
other cash allocation priorities.
In the UK, new employees have been offered membership 
of defined contribution rather than defined benefit schemes 
since April 2012 and, in the US, employees have not accrued 
salary-related benefits in defined benefit schemes since 
January 2013.
In November, the 2017 UK triennial funding valuations and, 
where necessary, deficit recovery plans were agreed with the 
trustees and certified by the scheme actuaries after consultation 
with the Pensions Regulator. The funding deficit across the 
UK schemes at 31 March 2017 was £2.1bn. Based on the 
new funding valuations, the Group will increase current annual 
deficit recovery payments to the UK schemes to £220m a 
year from 1 April 2018. The deficits in each of the schemes 
are expected to be cleared between 2021 and 2026. Under 
the last agreement made in 2014, all scheme deficits were 
only projected to be cleared in 2026.
9. Information technology security
The Group could be negatively impacted by information technology security threats.
The security threats faced by the Group 
include threats to its information technology 
infrastructure, unlawful attempts to gain access 
to its proprietary or classified information and 
the potential for business disruptions associated 
with information technology failures.
Failure to combat these risks 
effectively could negatively impact 
the Group’s reputation among its 
customers and the public, cause 
disruption to its business operations, 
and could result in a negative impact 
on the Group’s future results and 
financial condition.
The Group has a broad range of measures in place, including 
appropriate tools and techniques, to monitor and mitigate 
this risk.
10. People
The Group’s strategy is dependent on its ability to recruit and retain people with appropriate talent and skills.
Delivery of the Group’s strategy and business 
plan is dependent on its ability to compete 
to recruit and retain people with appropriate 
talent and skills, including those with innovative 
technological capabilities.
The Group’s business plan is targeting an 
increasing level of business in international export 
markets outside the US and UK. It is important 
that the Group recruits and retains management 
with the necessary international skills and 
experience in the relevant jurisdictions.
The loss of key employees or 
inability to attract the appropriate 
people on a timely basis could 
adversely impact its ability to deliver 
its strategy, meet the business plan 
and, accordingly, have a negative 
impact on the Group’s future 
results and financial condition.
The Group recognises that its employees are key to delivering 
its strategy and business plan, and focuses on developing the 
existing workforce and hiring talented people to meet current 
and future requirements.
The Group has well-established graduate recruitment and 
apprenticeship programmes and, in order to maximise the 
contribution that its workforce can make to the performance 
of the business, has an effective through-career capability 
development programme.
In order to seek to maximise its talent pool, the Group is 
committed to creating a diverse and inclusive environment 
for its employees.
Additional risks and uncertainties currently unknown to the Group, or which the Group currently deems immaterial, may also have an adverse 
effect on the business or financial condition of the Group.

Annual Report 2017
Strategic report Governance Financial statements Dear Shareholders,
The importance of having a clearly defined 
strategy for management to pursue and the 
right culture to guide behaviour and drive 
performance to implement the strategy 
remains a priority focus for the Board, as 
I highlight in the Chairman’s letter in this 
report (see pages 10 to 12).
Effective engagement with our stakeholders is 
equally an essential part of good governance, 
with particular emphasis on shareholders 
and customers.
Our shareholder contact is typically through 
our investor relations team on a day-to-day 
basis, which is supplemented by face-to-face 
meetings with our major shareholders by our 
Chief Executive and Group Finance Director 
at the time of our annual and half-year results. 
To ensure that our performance is viewed in 
the context of our broader Board policy, as 
Chairman, I try to meet with our major 
shareholders at least once a year to discuss 
governance, strategy, culture and succession.
Our Senior Independent Director is, of course, 
available to speak to shareholders at all times 
if an alternative or additional channel of 
communication is required. 
This year, we decided to widen the circle of 
contact with Board members by inviting a 
small group of shareholders to engage directly 
with the Board in an informal gathering to 
discuss the requirements of shareholders in 
general, and to review BAE Systems in 
particular. The meeting proved to be valuable 
to both parties and we will continue this 
practice in the years ahead.
Our second additional measure was to invite 
shareholders to a more formal morning 
meeting with our non-executive directors 
and Chief Executive for a brief presentation 
by each of the non-executive committee 
chairs on our remuneration, audit and 
corporate responsibility policies and 
procedures. The presentations were followed 
by an open question and answer session, 
which enabled shareholders to probe more 
deeply into the methods and mindsets of 
the non-executive team. Feedback on this 
session was particularly positive, and we will 
continue to conduct this type of meeting on 
a two-yearly basis or when there is material 
change in Board membership.

Chairman’s  
governance letter Governance highlights
– Executive succession planning – the planned succession process whereby Charles Woodburn 
succeeded Ian King as Chief Executive was completed in an orderly manner.
– Non-executive directors – Revathi Advaithi was appointed to the Board as an independent 
non-executive, further strengthening it, particularly with regards to multinational business 
leadership, and engineering and manufacturing experience and expertise.
– Audit re-tender – after a comprehensive and robust selection process led by the Audit 
Committee, Deloitte was selected for appointment to succeed KPMG as the Company’s 
auditors with effect from the Annual General Meeting in 2018.
– Shareholder engagement – the Board as a whole engaged directly with major shareholders, 
including the hosting of an event at which governance arrangements for the Board and its 
committees, and employee engagement activities were presented and discussed.
– Customer engagement – in order to help directors to develop their understanding of 
the Company’s performance and relationship with key UK customers at first-hand, during 
the year, the Board visited a customer site and also met with senior Royal Navy and 
Ministry of Defence officials.
– Reporting – the Board’s reporting on governance matters in these reports has been 
enhanced further, including greater focus on how the directors discharge their duties 
and promote the success of the Company.
Our customer contact is undertaken at all 
levels on a daily basis to ensure that the 
relationships we have continue to be open, 
transparent and productive. From a Board 
perspective, however, we felt it was important 
to provide the non-executive directors with 
first-hand knowledge of the challenges and 
opportunities with each of our major UK 
customers. To achieve this objective, we 
invited senior members of the Royal Navy and 
Ministry of Defence to join the Board for an 
open exchange on our strengths, weaknesses 
and opportunities. The forum provided a 
robust discussion which was both instructive 
and encouraging. We intend to extend 
invitations to other customers in the coming 
year in order to deepen our understanding 
of their needs and reinforce the relationships 
we enjoy.
As a discipline, a number of Board meetings 
are held on operational sites throughout 
the year which provide an opportunity for 
interaction with employees and a chance for 
non-executive directors to develop deeper 
insights into the quality of our current senior 
management and the potential for succession 
in the next generation.
During such visits, we meet individuals 
for breakfast and dinner, tour the sites 
and conduct town hall sessions with the 
workforce. During 2018, the Board will 
also accompany the executive management 
team to meet colleagues and customers in 
the US and the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.
Additionally, the Corporate Responsibility 
Committee makes independent visits to 
operational sites across the world to evaluate 
and encourage the adoption of the highest 
standards of corporate behaviour.
To further our practice of Board involvement in 
2018, we intend to nominate a non-executive 
director to accompany Charles Woodburn to 
participate in one of his regular meetings with 
trade unions representatives in the UK. 
As we look forward to the year ahead, we are 
determined to continue this policy of deeper 
engagement with all stakeholders to ensure 
we understand and respect the needs of our 
shareholders, our suppliers, our colleagues 
and our customers.
Sir Roger Carr Chairman
Board evaluation
Period of evaluation
January/February with feedback and review 
taking place at a Board meeting held on 
21 February 2018.
Evaluation process
Externally-facilitated self-assessment of the 
Board conducted in accordance with best 
practice described in the UK Corporate 
Governance Code and other guidance.
Facilitator
Ffion Hague at Independent Board Evaluation 
(IBE), which provides no other services to 
BAE Systems.
Description of process
All directors interviewed by the facilitator for 
1.5 hours based on a set agenda that had 
been tailored for BAE Systems. Ten senior 
executives were also interviewed.
Feedback
A comprehensive report was produced by 
IBE, which was provided to directors ahead 
of the Board meeting at which the principal 
findings were presented by Ms Hague. 
Among other things, the report covered 
shareholder and stakeholder relations; 
strategy; governance and compliance; 
Board focus; risk management; succession 
planning; Board composition; Board culture; 
relationship with senior management; 
decision-making; induction; papers; and 
Board resources.
Feedback from the evaluation will be 
provided to individual directors by the 
Chairman. Feedback on the Chairman’s 
own performance will be provided by the 
Senior Independent Director after he has 
met with all the non-executive directors 
to consider the material provided by IBE.
Resulting actions
The Board discussed the report and agreed 
actions concerning:
– executive and non-executive succession 
planning;
– employee engagement, and diversity 
and inclusion; and
– the provision of additional Board time 
for wider and more open-ended discussion 
of certain matters.
The Board will work on implementing 
these in 2018.

BAE Systems
Annual Report 2017
Financial statements Governance The directors of BAE Systems – and those 
of all UK companies – must act in accordance 
with a set of general duties. These duties 
are detailed in the UK’s Companies Act 
and include a duty to promote the success 
of the Company, which is summarised here.
As part of their induction, the directors are 
briefed on their duties and they can access 
professional advice on these – either through 
the Company or, if they judge it necessary, 
from an independent provider.
It is important to recognise that in large and 
complex companies, such as BAE Systems, 
the directors fulfil their duties partly through 
a governance framework that delegates 
day-to-day decision-making to employees 
of the Company.
The Board recognises that such delegation 
needs to be much more than simple financial 
authorities and, in this section of the report, 
we have summarised our governance 
structure, which covers: the values and 
behaviours expected of our employees; 
the standards they must adhere to; how 
we engage with stakeholders; and how the 
Board looks to ensure that we have a robust 
system of control and assurance processes.
For more detail on our governance structure, 
see pages 76 and 77.
Section 172 of the UK’s Companies Act
In summary, as required by Section 172 
of the UK’s Companies Act, a director 
of a company must act in the way he 
considers, in good faith, would most 
likely promote the success of the company 
for the benefit of its shareholders. In doing 
this, the director must have regard, 
amongst other matters, to the:
– likely consequences of any decisions 
in the long term;
– interests of the company’s employees;
– need to foster the company’s business 
relationships with suppliers, customers 
and others;
– impact of the company’s operations on 
the community and environment;
– company’s reputation for high standards 
of business conduct; and
– need to act fairly as between members 
of the company.
Shareholders
A board needs to communicate effectively with 
its shareholders and understand their views.
The Annual Report is the principal means by which 
the Board reports to shareholders on its stewardship 
of the Company. This report and other matters are 
put to shareholders for their consideration and 
approval at the Company’s Annual General 
Meeting, where the Board engages directly with 
shareholders. In addition, the Chairman meets 
regularly with our largest shareholders and provides 
feedback to the Board following these meetings.

Risk management
Risk management is the identification of 
key risks that could threaten the success of 
a company, and taking steps to reduce or 
eliminate them. A board needs to ensure 
that a company has effective risk 
management processes.
The Company has well-developed risk management 
processes, for which the Board has overall 
responsibility. The Audit and Corporate Responsibility 
committees jointly review the Operational Assurance 
Statement Risk Register and Non-financial Risk 
Register regularly. The Board considers risk as part 
of its annual strategy review process and also when 
considering major new business bids.
How we  
manage risk

Culture and values
The right corporate culture underpins how 
a company creates and sustains value over 
the longer term, and is a key element of 
maintaining a reputation for high standards 
of business conduct. Culture and values are 
important in setting the behavioural standards 
expected of employees.
During the year, the Board, which sets the Company’s 
values, considered the Company’s culture and the 
behaviours this is seen to be driving. The Board uses 
employee engagement surveys to help understand 
corporate culture across the Group. The Corporate 
Responsibility Committee monitors the types of 
issues reported through the Company’s Ethics 
Helpline and Ethics Officers to assist in monitoring 
corporate culture.

The Board approves the Company’s strategy and 
business plan. Each year, in November, it spends a 
whole day reviewing and agreeing strategy, which 
is detailed in the Company’s Integrated Business 
Plan (IBP). Through the year, and in preparation for 
the IBP, the Board undertakes a series of strategic 
updates with each of the Group’s business sectors.

Robust governance
In order to carry out their legal duties effectively, 
the directors of large companies should ensure 
they have a robust governance structure – 
underpinned by the right culture and values 
– which will ensure decisions are made at the 
appropriate level and, where necessary, by 
reference to required policies and procedures.
The Operational Framework documents the roles 
of the directors and executive management, 
detailing how and by whom key decisions are to 
be made. The Board and Audit Committee regularly 
review the effectiveness of the internal controls 
detailed in the Operational Framework, supported 
by our assurance processes. The Board uses its 
annual evaluation process to help ensure that it is 
effective in discharging its responsibilities.
Operational  
framework
76
Employees
A company’s employees are central to the 
long-term success of a company, as such a 
board needs to consider their interests, and 
have means of engaging with and 
understanding their views.
The Company has a well-developed structure 
through which senior management, including the 
Chief Executive, engages regularly with senior trade 
union officials to discuss and understand, in an 
open and well-informed basis, matters concerning 
UK employees. The Chief Executive briefs the Board 
on matters raised at these meetings. Board members 
engage with employees when visiting Company 
sites around the world, and it has held ‘town hall’ 
meetings as part of such visits.
Our  
people

Major decisions
Many of the decisions and actions of large 
companies are made on the basis of authority 
delegated by the board. However, to ensure 
that major decisions – particularly those not in 
the normal course of business, involving large 
values or with a possible impact on the 
reputation of the company – are considered 
and taken by the directors. A board should 
reserve certain matters for its own decision.
The Operational Framework clearly details the 
matters that the Board has reserved for its own 
decision. Where matters are delegated, financial and 
other limits are set to ensure that major decisions are 
referred to the Board. This includes major business 
opportunities, capital expenditures and the nature 
of the business that the Company should undertake.
Operational  
framework
76
Business relationships
Fostering business relationships with key 
stakeholders, such as customers and suppliers, 
is key to a company’s success. As such, a board 
should have oversight of these relationships.
The Board’s annual programme provides opportunities 
for it to engage with our principal customers, and 
gain at first-hand an understanding of their 
requirements and the Company’s performance in 
meeting these. The Chairman is engaged actively 
in developing customer relationships at the most 
senior level and reports regularly on this to the 
Board. During the year, the Corporate Responsibility 
Committee undertook a deep dive into how we 
engage with suppliers.
Group strategic

Assurance
A board needs assurance that a company’s 
financial reporting, risk management, 
governance and internal control processes 
are operating effectively. This is essential to 
the success of the company and its long-term 
reputation.
The Board, principally through the Audit and 
Corporate Responsibility committees, engages 
throughout the year with the Company’s auditors 
and internal audit function, and receives feedback 
on their audit and review activities. In addition, it 
has put in place certain key assurance processes, 
such as the Operational Assurance Statement.
Operational Assurance 
Statement
77
Performance oversight
The board of a large company will normally 
delegate day-to-day management to executive 
management. However, it must maintain 
oversight of the company’s performance and 
ensure that management is acting in 
accordance with its delegated authority, and 
the values and standards that underpin this.
At each Board meeting, the directors receive a 
comprehensive report from the Chief Executive on 
the performance of the Company. The effectiveness 
of such reporting is supported by a system of risk 
management and internal control processes – all of 
which is underpinned by the values and standards 
mandated in our Operational Framework.

Remuneration and incentives
A board needs to ensure that executive 
management and other employees are 
remunerated and incentivised in a manner 
that is consistent with the directors’ duty 
to promote the success of the company 
and the consequences of their decisions 
in the long term.
In addition to setting the remuneration of the 
executive directors, the Board’s Remuneration 
Committee reviews and approves the remuneration 
structure for all senior executives, including 
incentive targets and their outcomes. It also 
oversees the operation of the all-employee share 
plans that reward and incentivise employees across 
the Group.

Standards
To promote the success of a company and 
maintain a reputation for high standards 
of business conduct, a board should set the 
expectations and requirements with regards 
to the behaviours and standards required by 
its employees and others associated with it.
Through the Operational Framework, which 
includes our Code of Conduct, the Board has 
agreed policies that set the standards of behaviour 
and business practice. Also, through these policies, 
the Board sets standards and requirements with 
regards to key governance matters, including: 
our people; our commitment to the community 
and the environment; standards of business 
conduct; and our relationship with suppliers.

Board  
governance Core business processes
These core business processes are mandated by the Operational Framework and designed to ensure consistent planning, 
reporting and review of business performance across all businesses:
How we work
The Operational Framework sets out the principles of 
good governance which, together with our culture, guide 
our work and behaviour in support of the strategy set in 
our Group strategic framework (see page 18). Here we 
set out the values that we ask all our employees to 
demonstrate in their day-to-day work, wherever they 
are in the world.
Organisation
From the Board downwards, we set out how we are 
organised and the responsibilities of the Board, the 
Chairman, the Chief Executive, the Executive Committee, 
our Functional Councils (such as Engineering, Human 
Resources and Procurement) and the senior executives 
charged with running our businesses.
Governance
The UK Corporate Governance Code’s (the Code) principles are embedded in the Operational Framework, and 
its policies and processes underpin all the disclosures made by the Board pursuant to the Code’s provisions.
How we conduct our business is fundamental to the success of BAE Systems. The Operational Framework sets 
out our approach and the standards to which we adhere. It includes the following:
Code of Conduct
Lays out the 
standards that are 
expected of each 
of us, to support 
us in doing the right 
thing. All employees 
receive annual 
training designed 
to stimulate 
conversations 
about ethical 
decision-making.
Responsible 
Trading Principles
We do not 
compromise on the 
way we do business 
and here we mandate 
a principles-based 
approach to our 
business activity.
Internal controls
Provide assurance 
regarding:
– the reliability 
and integrity of 
information;
– compliance with 
policies, processes, 
laws, regulations 
and contracts;
– the safeguarding 
of assets and 
protection against 
fraud; and 
– the economical 
and efficient use 
of resources.
Risk framework
This is how we 
identify, analyse, 
evaluate and 
mitigate risk 
(see page 66).
Workplace and 
operational 
environment
This covers how we 
expect our people 
to be managed and 
the obligations 
placed on us all 
concerning avoiding 
conflicts of interest, 
anti-bribery, and 
managing the 
security of our 
people, information 
and other assets.
Delegated 
authorities
As part of a robust 
system of internal 
controls, the Board 
has delegated 
certain authorities 
to executive 
management. 
Delegation is subject 
to financial limits 
and other 
restrictions, above 
which matters 
must be referred 
to the Board.
IBP
(Integrated Business Planning)
Approved by the Board annually, 
creates a consistent approach 
to strategic planning, aligning 
resources with the delivery of 
forecast financial performance 
and strategic objectives.
LCM
(Lifecycle Management Policy)
How we plan and manage the 
execution of all projects above a 
certain minimum level, providing 
decision gate reviews at key 
stages from initial opportunity 
to final closure.
M&A
(Mergers & Acquisitions Policy)
A structured approach to 
mergers, acquisitions and 
disposals.
TPL
(T otal Performance Leadership)
A set of people-related 
activities that help to identify, 
select, manage and reward 
leaders, and facilitates 
succession planning.
Operational Assurance Statement (OAS)
This key governance process requires that a return is completed every six months by each operational and functional business 
head, reporting their formal view against such matters as compliance with law and regulation, ethical business conduct, 
financial controls, risk management, compliance with business planning processes, health and safety, conflicts of interest, 
delegated authorities, appointment of advisers and product safety. There is a separate OAS process for our joint ventures. 
Our Internal Audit function owns the OAS process. It is managed independently from management functions. The Internal 
Audit Director reports functionally to the Audit Committee and, for day-to-day operations, to the Chief Executive.

Annual Report 2017
Board  
information Risk management and internal 
control statement
The Board is responsible for the Company’s 
risk management and internal control systems. 
It has delegated responsibility for reviewing in 
detail the effectiveness of these systems to the 
Audit Committee, which reports to the Board 
on its findings so that all directors can take a 
view on the matter. 
An overview of the processes used to identify, 
evaluate and manage the principal risks can be 
found on pages 66 and 67. These processes 
are an integral part of our governance 
framework, the Operational Framework, 
details of which can be found on page 76. 
The Operational Framework mandates the 
Operational Assurance Statement process, 
which is owned by the Company’s Internal 
Audit function and is one of the principal 
processes used by the Board in monitoring 
the effectiveness of control systems.
The risk management and internal control 
systems detailed in the Operational Framework 
were in place throughout the year and the 
Board, having reviewed their effectiveness, 
believes they accord with the Financial 
Reporting Council’s Guidance on Risk 
Management, Internal Control and Related 
Financial and Business Reporting.
Viability statement
Assessment
As required by the provisions of the Code, the 
Board has undertaken an assessment of the 
future prospects of the Company taking into 
account the Company’s current position and 
principal risks. This assessment was informed 
by the following business processes: 
Risk management process – the Company 
has developed a structured approach to the 
management of risk (see above) and the 
principal risks identified are considered as part 
of the Board’s annual review of the Integrated 
Business Plan. 
Integrated Business Plan (IBP) – the IBP 
represents a common process with standard 
outputs and requirements that produces an 
integrated strategic and business plan for the 
Group and also for each of its businesses over 
the following five years. The use of a five-year 
period provides a robust planning tool against 
which long-term decisions can be made 
concerning, amongst other things, strategic 
priorities, funding requirements (including 
commitments to Group pension schemes), 
returns made to shareholders, capital 
expenditure and resource planning. Longer-
term strategic inputs also form part of the 
IBP process and, where activity is required 
to meet such long-term priorities, this is 
provided for in the plan. 
The detailed plan is reviewed each year 
by the Board as part of its strategy review 
process. Once approved by the Board, the 
IBP provides the basis for setting all detailed 
financial budgets and strategic actions across 
the businesses, and is subsequently used 
by the Board to monitor performance. 
Liquidity analysis – the Board regularly 
reviews an analysis based on the financial 
output from the IBP, looking at the forecast 
working capital requirements, cash flow, 
and committed borrowing and other funding 
facilities available to the Company over the 
five-year period covered by the IBP. This 
analysis includes ‘stress testing’ of the 
Company’s liquidity under severe, but 
plausible, scenarios as developed from the 
IBP, including the following:
– the Company being unable to access debt 
markets to renew term debt facilities; 
– an unfavourable change to the terms of 
trade the Company enjoys with certain 
principal customers; 
– the Company failing to win certain major 
export contracts; and
– potential change of UK government policy.
The scenarios tested included the impact 
of multiple adverse factors.
Conclusion
In undertaking its review of the IBP in 2017, 
the Board considered the prospects of the 
Company over the five-year period covered 
by the process. On the basis of this and other 
matters considered and reviewed by the 
Board, the Board has reasonable expectations 
that the Company will be able to continue in 
operation and meet its liabilities as they fall 
due over the following five years. It is 
recognised that such future assessments are 
subject to a level of uncertainty that increases 
with time and, therefore, future outcomes 
cannot be guaranteed or predicted with 
certainty. Also, this assessment was made 
recognising the principal risks that could have 
an impact on the future performance of the 
Company (see pages 68 to 71).
Going concern statement
Accounting standards require that directors 
satisfy themselves that it is reasonable for 
them to conclude whether it is appropriate 
to prepare financial statements on a going 
concern basis and the Code requires that, if 
appropriate, this report includes a statement 
to that effect. Following review, the directors 
have concluded that it is appropriate to 
adopt the going concern basis for these 
financial statements and have not identified 
any material uncertainties concerning the 
Company’s ability to do so in the 12-month 
period from the date of approving them.
For this reason, they continue to adopt the 
going concern basis in preparing the accounts.
Directors
In compliance with the Code, all directors are 
subject to annual election by shareholders. 
The Chairman has confirmed that, based on 
the formal performance evaluations undertaken 
in 2017, all remain committed to the role and 
the individual performance of all directors 
continues to be effective. Also, in compliance 
with the Code, the Company ensures that 
non-executive directors have sufficient time 
to fulfil their obligations. This is assessed when 
a director is appointed and also in the event 
of there being a material change to an 
individual’s circumstances. 
At the beginning of 2018, Elizabeth Corley, 
a non-executive director of the Company, 
was appointed as a non-executive director 
of Morgan Stanley, a US listed company. 
One of its UK subsidiary companies provides 
corporate broking services to the Company 
and, consequently, an assessment has been 
undertaken to determine whether this 
relationship has a bearing on her independence 
for the purposes of provision B.1.1 of the 
Code. After review, it was determined that this 
was not a material business relationship given 
the relatively low value of the contractual 
arrangements and the nature of the 
relationship, i.e. broking services are provided 
by a UK subsidiary of Morgan Stanley and her 
appointment is to the board of the US parent 
company and non-executive in nature.
Should there be any change to either 
Elizabeth Corley’s role with Morgan Stanley 
or a material change in the services its UK 
subsidiary provides to the Company, this 
decision will be reconsidered.
In addition to being a non-executive director 
of the Company, Ian Tyler is chairman of two 
listed FTSE 250 companies, Bovis Homes Group 
and Cairn Energy, and also two non-listed 
companies, AWE Management, a private 
company owned by three joint-venture partners, 
and Amey, a subsidiary of a Spanish listed 
company. The Chairman has reviewed Ian 
Tyler’s other commitments and is satisfied that 
they do not impinge on his ability to discharge 
his responsibilities to BAE Systems effectively. 
He will keep this matter under review.
All directors undertake a structured induction 
programme when they first join the Board, 
thereafter they regularly update and refresh 
their knowledge of the Company.
The Company considers that all of the 
non-executive directors identified on pages 
78 and 79 of this report are independent in 
accordance with Code provisions.
UK Corporate Governance Code (the Code) compliance
The Company was compliant with the provisions of the 
Code throughout 2017 and the Board has applied its principles 
in its governance structure and operations. The following 
statements are made in compliance with the Code.

disclosures Dear Shareholders,
The section on the Audit Committee’s year 
on page 86 provides an overview of the 
work that we have undertaken in the last 
12 months and I would like to focus here 
on specific aspects of that activity.
We reported last year on progress to date on 
our audit tender which has been conducted 
in accordance with the audit tender and 
transition timeframe set out in the graphic 
below. I am pleased to report that the 
tender exercise was completed to timescale, 
enabling the Audit Committee to make a 
recommendation to the Board in May 2017 
which it subsequently endorsed. Subject to 
shareholder approval at the 2018 Annual 
General Meeting (AGM), Deloitte LLP will 
succeed KPMG LLP as the Company’s auditor 
at the end of that meeting. More detail on 
the audit re-tender is set out on page 83.
My Audit Committee colleagues and I are 
highly appreciative of the time and effort 
that audit firms expend in preparing their 
responses to tenders and would like to thank 
the participating firms for their professionalism 
and diligence in this regard.
Audit rotation regulations going forward 
will require large companies to re-tender 
their external audit service no less frequently 
than every ten years. 
Our focus since the recommendation was 
endorsed by the Board has been two-fold: 
ensuring that audit quality is maintained 
for the 2017 half-year and full-year audits 
from the outgoing auditor, whilst at the same 
time ensuring that the proposed incoming 
auditor is readying itself for the engagement in 
terms of both audit engagement compliance 
issues and familiarisation with the business. 
More detail on work undertaken by Deloitte 
on the transition arrangements is set out on 
page 83.
Audit re-tender and transition aside, the 
Committee has continued its monitoring 
of the financial reporting process and 
its integrity, risk management systems 
and assurance.
During the year, we have reviewed the initial 
disclosures for IFRS 15, Revenue from Contracts 
with Customers, and related briefings on the 
impact on the financial statements. Further 
information on IFRS 15 is provided in note 34 
to the Group accounts on pages 199 to 201.
As reported on page 21, the Group has 
been restructuring its portfolio of interests 
in a number of industrial companies in 
Saudi Arabia in order to support the 
Kingdom’s Vision 2030 industrialisation 
strategy. During the year, we have focused 
on controls in our Saudi business, as well 
as governance in relation to this portfolio 
of collaborative partnerships.
We have continued in our efforts to leverage 
optimal use of the Internal Audit function 
within the risk environment. An external 
assessment of the function originally 
scheduled to be undertaken in 2017 has been 
deferred until 2018 following organisational 
changes taking effect from 1 January 2018. 
The assessment has been commissioned and 
will commence in the first quarter of 2018.

Chairman of the Audit Committee Audit re-tender
Key elements of the audit re-tender were as follows:
– overseen by the Audit Committee who agreed the scope 
of the Request for Proposal (RFP);
– assessment of tender participants informed by complexity 
of the Group and scale of its international business;
– tender competed by highly capable and experienced 
international audit firms with strong track records and 
technical expertise;
– no contractual obligations restricted the selection of firms 
participating in the audit;
– current incumbent, KPMG LLP (and its predecessors), had 
been in place as the Company’s auditors since 1981 without 
re-tender and was thus not invited to tender;
– evaluation criteria in the RFP included:
– audit quality and independence;
– understanding of the Group’s business;
– capability of audit team in terms of skills, experience 
and geographic reach;
– clear planning and audit approach; and
– robust challenge, insight and proactivity;
– business meetings and site visits scheduled to enable 
the participating firms to gain an understanding of the 
Group’s business;
– presentations made to the Audit Committee by participating 
firms, with question and answer sessions; 
– Audit Committee put forward formal recommendation to the 
Board that, of two audit firms capable of undertaking the audit 
appointment, Deloitte LLP was its preferred choice; and
– Board endorsed the Committee’s recommendation and 
will recommend the appointment of Deloitte LLP at the 
2018 AGM.
Audit transition
Activity undertaken by Deloitte, as the incoming auditor
1
 for the

with the Committee and finance teams across the Group;
– held regular meetings with Group Finance Director, 
Director, Financial Control and Reporting, and business

– worked closely with Internal Audit to understand their 2017 
and 2018 work programmes, and used the outputs to inform 
the 2018 Audit Plan and risk assessment process;

reported regularly on independence and audit transition 
plan status; and

Annual Report 2017
Financial statements Governance Audit Quality Review (AQR) 
The Financial Reporting Council’s AQR team 
monitors the quality of audit work of certain 
UK audit firms through inspections of a sample 
of audits and related procedures at individual 
audit firms. During the year, the 2016 external 
audit of the Group by KPMG was reviewed 
by the AQR. The review covered certain items 
of the Group-level audit (including retirement 
benefit obligations, taxation, procedures in 
relation to the risks of bribery and corruption, 
and the quality of communications with the 
Audit Committee) and the audit of recognition 
of revenues and profits on long-term contracts 
by two of the business unit audit teams. I met 
with the AQR to gain an understanding of 
its report and the Committee discussed the 
review findings with KPMG. The AQR 
reported a number of recommendations for 
improvement and also areas of high standard. 
The recommendations were incorporated 
into the 2017 audit work and the Committee 
is satisfied that they have been properly 
addressed. The Committee does not consider 
any of the findings to have a significant impact 
on KPMG’s audit approach. We will make the 
lessons learned from this report available to 
our incoming auditor, Deloitte.
Audit independence 
We have reviewed in detail the confirmation 
and information received from KPMG on 
the arrangements that they have in place 
to safeguard auditor independence and 
objectivity, including specific safeguards in 
place where they are providing permissible 
non-audit services to the Group. 
As part of the auditor transition arrangements, 
we have reviewed on a regular basis the steps 
being taken by Deloitte, the proposed incoming 
auditor, to achieve audit independence from 
1 January 2018 onwards. 
Non-audit services policy
The Committee has a formal policy 
governing the engagement of the auditors 
to provide non-audit services which we 
review on an annual basis. The policy 
prohibits certain activities from being 
undertaken by the auditors and also places 
restrictions on the employment of former 
employees of the auditors. 
Recognising that the auditors are best placed 
to undertake certain work of a non-audit 
nature, the policy permits the provision of 
Audit-Related Services and Permitted 
Non-Audit Services up to limits that are 
pre-approved by the Committee, with specific 
approvals required beyond such limits by the 
Committee. A copy of the policy is available 
on the Company’s website, baesystems.com.
As reported last year, we made revisions 
to the policy in order to ensure compliance 
with the Financial Reporting Council’s revised 
regulations on ethical standards for auditors 
and EU regulations adopted by the UK which 
apply prohibitions to a range of engagements 
that could result in an auditor facing a 
conflict of interest. As a result, certain services 
formerly provided by KPMG, primarily tax 
services and investor information services, 
were no longer provided by them with effect 
from 1 January 2017. 
Details of fees payable to the auditors are 
set out on page 151. In 2017, non-audit fees 
represented 15% of the audit fee. The principal 
non-audit services provided by the auditors 
related to the interim review and accounting 
advice primarily in respect of IFRS 15. 
Financial statements
The Committee reviews all significant issues 
concerning the financial statements. The 
principal matters we considered concerning 
the 2017 financial statements were:
Recognition of revenue, profit
and provisioning
We reviewed key estimates and judgements 
prior to publication of the financial statements. 
Our review included the key estimates and 
assumptions applied in determining the 
financial status of the more significant 
programmes, including Typhoon, UK aircraft 
carrier programme, Astute Class submarine 
programme and Saudi British Defence 
Co-operation Programme. 
Pensions
Recognising the scale of the Group’s pension 
obligation, we reviewed the key assumptions 
supporting the valuation of the retirement 
benefit obligation. This included a comparison 
of the discount and inflation rates used against 
externally-derived data. We reviewed the 
methodology used to allocate a proportion 
of the retirement benefit obligation to equity 
accounted investments and concluded that 
this was appropriate with reference to 
agreements between the Company and those 
companies. We also considered the adequacy 
of disclosures in respect of the sensitivity of 
the deficit to changes in these key assumptions, 
as well as the results of the UK triennial funding 
valuations (see note 21 to the Group accounts 
on pages 174 to 183).
How we ensure that the Group’s 
financial statements, taken as a 
whole, are fair, balanced and 
understandable
The process is: 
– comprehensive guidance issued to all 
the contributors at operational level;
– a verification process dealing with the 
factual content of the reports;
– comprehensive reviews undertaken 
at different levels in the Group that 
aim to ensure consistency and overall 
balance; and
– comprehensive review by the directors 
and the Executive Committee.
How the effectiveness of the external 
audit process was assessed
Who we surveyed:
– Executive directors
– Operating group/sector and line 
of business management
– Internal Audit Director
– Other senior executives, including 
key finance roles
Areas we covered:
– Understanding of the Group’s risks
– Audit plan
– Robustness of audit processes
– Objectivity
– Quality of communications
– Ability to provide a seamless 
service across differing jurisdictions
as well as interaction with the Committee 
members.
This review related to KPMG’s final 
audit prior to rotating off our account. 
The feedback has been shared with them 
and will also help inform our discussions 
on audit scope and process with Deloitte, 
our incoming auditor.

continued outputs of general financial and LCM controls 
testing, and any required improvement 
actions, with management, and internal and 
external audit, with a view to ensuring the 
ongoing robustness of programme execution 
and risk mitigation. 
We have reviewed the ongoing effectiveness 
of the Company’s risk management processes 
as part of our wider review of internal controls. 
The Group’s principal risks are set out on 
pages 68 to 71.
Internal audit
Internal Audit plays an integral role in the 
Company’s governance structure and provides 
regular reports to the Committee, including 
the outputs of the twice-yearly OAS process 
and the tracking of remedial action in the case 
of any control failures. 
The annual Internal Audit programme is 
agreed jointly by the Audit and Corporate 
Responsibility committees to ensure that 
the overarching programme covers not only 
financial risk, but also the assessment of 
the effectiveness of key areas of ethical and 
reputational risk. The assurance programme 
covers a broad range of audits covering areas 
such as mandated governance, OAS outputs, 
risk register findings, change programmes, 
structural and business changes, and areas 
relating to responsible behaviour and 
non-financial risk. Internal Audit may also 
from time-to-time undertake other work 
within the context of the risk environment. 
As part of this year’s process, we reviewed 
the scope of annual audits and recalibrated 
them against the current risk environment.
During the year under review, and separate 
from the normal regular sessions we hold 
with the Internal Audit Director without 
management present, we held a separate 
session with him, his heads of internal 
audit and the external auditor, which 
has helped inform our view on how 
to optimise internal audit resource for 
value-added assurance. 
After discussion of the 2017 evaluation 
output with the Internal Audit Director, the 
Committee concluded that the Internal Audit 
function remains effective. As reported earlier, 
an external assessment of the function will 
commence in the first quarter of 2018.
Nick Rose
Chairman of the Audit Committee
Goodwill
We considered the level of goodwill held 
on the Group’s balance sheet in respect of 
a number of past major transactions and 
whether, given the future prospects of these 
businesses, the value of goodwill held on 
the balance sheet remains appropriate. The 
methodology for impairment testing used by 
the Group is set out in note 8 to the Group 
accounts on page 158. As a result of this 
review, there has been an impairment of 
goodwill held in respect of Applied Intelligence 
of £384m reflecting the future level and timing 
of expected returns from the business. 
Taxation
Whilst tax policy is ultimately a matter for 
the Board’s determination, we reviewed the 
Group’s tax strategy as set out on page 34. 
Twice during the year, we reviewed the 
Group’s tax charge, tax provisions and the 
basis of recoverability of the deferred tax 
asset relating to the Group’s pension deficit. 
Going concern and viability statements
The Committee agreed the parameters 
of, and reviewed the supporting report for, 
the going concern statement (see page 81) 
and the statement on the Board’s assessment 
of the prospects of the Company (the viability 
statement on page 81) over the five-year 
period used in the Integrated Business Plan.
Internal control and risk
The Board has delegated to the Committee 
responsibility for reviewing in detail the 
effectiveness of the Company’s risk 
management and internal control system. 
The Committee’s review of the effectiveness 
of internal controls has encompassed a review 
of the reports relating to the six-monthly 
Operational Assurance Statements (OAS), which 
are submitted by each business or function 
as a mandated policy under the Group-wide 
Operational Framework, controls reports, and 
reports from both internal and external auditors.
A key focus for the Committee is the controls 
environment surrounding the Company’s 
Lifecycle Management (LCM) process, the 
bedrock of our programme execution and 
management. LCM is integral to the successful 
execution of the Group’s projects and 
programmes, and of particular importance 
in the early identification of programme risk 
and the determination of profit recognition or 
provisioning which, you will see from above, 
tend to be areas where we are required to 
exercise judgement. We have discussed the 
Competition and Markets 
Authority Audit Order
The Committee has complied with 
the provisions of the Competition and 
Markets Authority Audit Order in respect 
of committee responsibilities and audit 
re-tendering disclosures.
Committee composition and evaluation
The breadth of experience of the 
Audit Committee members is set out 
on page 79. The performance evaluation 
of the Committee is undertaken as part 
of the wider Board evaluation and the 
Board believes the Committee to have 
the appropriate composition, skills and 
experience to discharge its responsibilities.
How the Committee assesses the 
effectiveness of Internal Audit
Who we survey:
– Group-wide heads of Audit Review 
Boards
– Other business leaders
– External auditors
Areas for requested feedback include:
– Role of Internal Audit and 
independence
– Audit planning, processes and 
execution
– People resources and skilling
– Communications and reporting

Annual Report 2017
Audit Committee report 
continued Ian T yler 
Chairman of the Corporate Responsibility Committee
Dear Shareholders,
It is my pleasure to once again be reporting 
to you on the business of the Corporate 
Responsibility Committee during 2017. 
Through this report I aim to give you an 
insight into the programme of work that 
we have undertaken, our areas of focus 
during 2017 and how we aim to develop 
these into 2018. 
The corporate responsibility landscape 
continues to evolve and, as such, the 
Committee monitors developments to 
ensure that our agenda remains relevant, 
whilst keeping a keen eye on the matters 
that have been our principal focus for some 
time. During 2017, we increased the intensity 
of our review of diversity and inclusion across 
the different areas of the business. We also 
looked at responsible trading, the way in 
which the Company interacts with our 
suppliers and how the Company engages 
with employees. I will provide detail on each 
of these areas through this report and begin 
with a discussion of our health and safety 
agenda, which remains a key priority.
Safety
Safety continues to be a key priority for the 
Committee and we remain focused on making 
progress towards achieving world-class 
performance wherever possible. During the 
year, we carried out a deep-dive review of the 
safety performance of the US business to 
understand the factors driving these specific 
safety performance metrics. In 2017, there 
was a 3% reduction in the Recordable 
Accident Rate and a 28% reduction in the total 
number of major injuries recorded. To ensure 
that we do not lose focus on this important 
area, the Board continues to prioritise safety 
in the business through the inclusion of a 
specific safety objective that is designed to 
be realistic, but stretching, and which forms 
part of our executive annual incentive scheme 
(see page 101).
Diversity and inclusion
In July, we welcomed Charles Woodburn to 
the Board in the position of Chief Executive. 
Charles has now taken on the role of 
Chairman of the Company’s Diversity and 
Inclusion Council, and he will be engaging 
with the Committee on the Council’s priorities 
and the progress that is being made to drive 
business performance. 
In my report last year I explained that, 
during 2016, the Committee sought to gain 
an understanding from management on the 
Company’s objectives and plans with regard 
to diversity and inclusion. At the conclusion 
of our programme of work in 2016, it was 
clear to me that, whilst taking a top-level view 
had been helpful to set the scene, it did not 
provide us with a rich enough view of what 
the challenges were at business unit level. 
Each business has its distinct challenges, and 
the Committee was keen to understand what 
these were and how the management boards 
were addressing them. We therefore invited 
each line of business to meet with the 
Committee to discuss how they were building 
the diversity and inclusion strategy into their 
work. From the discussions we held with the 
line leaders, we gained a more informed view 
of the progress being made, but we also gained 
an appreciation of why this is an evolving issue 
and one that we as a Committee need to 
continue to focus on in 2018. 
The Committee held a very useful discussion 
on the particular challenges that the Saudi 
Arabian business faces in terms of local 
recruitment and retention, and gender diversity 
in particular. One of the issues that sits 
alongside our consideration of diversity and 
inclusion is the development of talent across 
all backgrounds and it is promising to see that 
developments in the educational opportunities 
for women are being translated into changes 
to the demographic of our employees. 
At the end of 2017, the Committee had 
reviewed the diversity and inclusion approach 
for each line of business which has given the 
Committee a better understanding of the 
actions that are taking place at management 
board level to embed a culture of diversity and 
inclusion. During 2018, the Committee will 
continue to keep this high on its agenda as we 
consider the accountability measures that are 
required to ensure that we have the necessary 
commitment and engagement to deliver 
further improvement.
Responsible trading
The Committee has continued to review 
the issue of responsible trading. During 
the year we reviewed the anti-bribery and 
anti-corruption policies, which included the 
Lobbying, Adviser, and Gifts and Hospitality 
policies. These policies set out the expectations 
that we have of our employees.

Focus on diversity and inclusion
The Corporate Responsibility Committee continued to focus on diversity and inclusion 
throughout 2017 and this has remained a key agenda item at each of the quarterly 
meetings. Our goal is to build a culture of inclusion and inclusive leadership globally, 
and the Committee has played a key role in driving and supporting the development of 
market plans and strategies to foster diversity and inclusion throughout the organisation.
The Corporate Responsibility Committee has reinforced accountability for diversity and 
inclusion through the promotion of:
– demographic data analysis to identify targeted diversity and inclusion actions;
– numeric goals and milestones to increase the representation of minority groups and 
accelerate diversity;
– recruitment processes that support increasing pipelines and mitigate unconscious bias;
– inclusive leadership training programmes;
– employee resource groups and local councils; and
– a focus on early careers and next-generation recruitment to address retirement risk and 
Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics skills shortages.

Annual Report 2017
Financial statements Governance
Corporate Responsibility  
Committee report The Committee also reviewed the different 
ways in which the Company assesses and 
makes judgements on the types of products 
and services that are developed and sold 
and the customers that we will do business 
with. We considered some of the key export 
markets where we operate and held in-depth 
discussions with the management team on 
our approach to existing and new business 
opportunities, and how we engage with 
governments and customers. In particular, the 
Committee reviewed and carefully considered 
the manner in which the Company operates 
in these markets, looking at government 
relationships and the controls we have in 
place aimed at ensuring that we operate 
legally and in accordance with our responsible 
business policies.
For all of these areas we aimed to understand 
how management assesses risk, from both 
an operational and reputational perspective. 
In support of this we also looked at the 
Product Trading Policy which looks to ensure 
that the required standards of integrity are met. 
We are continuing to focus on responsible 
trading as part of our 2018 agenda.
Responsible procurement
The Committee undertook a deep dive into 
the way in which the Company engages with 
suppliers. In 2016, the Company embarked 
on a major programme of change within 
its procurement function. The Committee 
therefore met with the Chief Procurement 
Officer to discuss the changes made to the 
global Procurement Policy, the structure and 
role of the Procurement Council and the 
Supplier Principles, launched in January 2017.
The Committee was interested in understanding 
two aspects of procurement in particular. The 
first was how the Company can be confident 
that its suppliers, and their supply chains in 
turn, are meeting similar responsible business 
standards to those that we set for ourselves. 
The Supplier Principles detail what the Company 
expects and these have been benchmarked 
against global best practice. The second 
aspect was how we as a customer engage 
with our supply chain and the relationships we 
build with this crucial element of our business. 
The Committee will revisit this topic in 2018 
to review the progress that has been made.
Employee engagement
The Committee has considered how the 
Company engages with employees to gain 
an understanding of their views and opinions. 
There are challenges to engaging effectively 
with a large number of employees across a 
number of countries. To meet this challenge 
new engagement surveys have been developed, 
and we reviewed the way in which the ‘Agile’ 
survey is being used to gain a quick response 
from employees on specific topics. Each 
business has the ability to tailor the questions 
asked to suit their specific engagement needs 
which gives a new agility to the process. The 
Committee was also interested to understand 
how management responds to these surveys. 
It was encouraging to see that both the 
quantitative results and the qualitative 
comments were considered in detail by the 
management teams as part of their 
engagement process. The Committee will 
continue to review the employee engagement 
agenda during 2018.
Next year
As in previous years, the agenda for 2018 
will be developed to ensure that we maintain 
a focus on our rolling agenda of safety, ethics, 
diversity and inclusion, and responsible 
business conduct. In addition to this, we look 
to include deep dives on other areas to 
broaden our understanding of the challenges 
and opportunities across the business in 
relation to corporate responsibility.
Ian Tyler
Chairman of the Corporate 
Responsibility Committee
Focus on employee 
engagement
It is important for the members of the 
Board to be able to understand the views 
and opinions of employees. The Company 
engages with employees in a number of 
different ways to gain feedback on what 
is happening across the business and to 
build a dialogue on key issues. This 
includes meeting with employees and 
the use of employee engagement surveys. 
The opportunity to have face-to-face 
engagement with employees is regularly 
included in the agenda for site visits 
undertaken by the Board. These 
discussions are one of the ways in which 
the Board can gauge the success of the 
engagement and to listen directly to the 
views of employees.
During 2017, the Corporate Responsibility 
Committee reviewed the output of the 
employee engagement surveys and, in 
2018, we will look closely at the ways 
in which the Board will develop the 
frameworks for how it engages with 
employees across the business.

Annual Report 2017
Financial statements Governance Dear Shareholders,
I’m pleased to report that 2017 saw a 
successful conclusion to the Chief Executive 
succession planning process – as managed 
by the Nominations Committee – with 
Charles Woodburn succeeding Ian King on 
1 July. It was back in March 2015 that the 
Committee first identified Charles as a 
possible candidate for the role, and I would 
like to thank him and Ian for the professional 
and helpful manner in which they conducted 
themselves during a rigorous and lengthy 
selection and handover process. 
Charles is well supported in his new role 
by two very able and experienced fellow 
executive directors; Jerry DeMuro, who 
leads our US business, and Peter Lynas, 
Group Finance Director. I’m pleased that 
Peter has agreed to take a wider management 
role, and since November last year he has 
been responsible for UK Shared Services, 
Procurement and Group Mergers & 
Acquisitions. 
Last year, I committed to further strengthen 
the non-executive representation on the 
Board. I’m delighted that we were able 
to achieve this with the appointment of 
Revathi Advaithi on 1 January this year. 
With an international industrial sector 
background and a good understanding of 
the digital economy, Revathi’s knowledge 
and experience will be an asset to the Board. 
Heidrick & Struggles – JCA Group

 worked 
with the Committee to assist in her 
recruitment and Spencer Stuart

 performed 
a similar role in the Chief Executive search.
Looking ahead, next year Nick Rose, who 
chairs our Audit Committee and is also our 
Senior Independent Director, will have served 
on the Board for nine years and has indicated 
that he will retire in 2019. Consequently, the 
Committee has initiated a search process to 
identify a suitable candidate to succeed Nick 
in leading the Audit Committee. 
BAE Systems recognises the value of being an 
inclusive employer with a diverse workforce. 
This also applies at Board level, and we 
continue to make good progress in increasing 
the diversity of the Board. In terms of gender, 
36% of Board members are women, which 
exceeds our previously stated policy target 
of 33% or greater by 2020 – as targeted by 
the Hampton-Alexander Review. This remains 
our policy concerning gender. In terms of 
other aspects of Board diversity, our policy 
is to continue, over time, to create a Board 
that not only brings together individuals with 
the right skills, knowledge and experience, 
but also has a diversity that reflects the 
multi-national nature of our Company and 
the increasingly global nature of the business 
world in general. However, individual merit 
will always be the prime consideration when 
making appointments to the Board. We will 
continue to engage with search consultants 
to identify candidates in a manner that is 
consistent with achieving an appropriately 
diverse board. 
One of the Committee’s objectives over the 
last couple of years has been to develop a 
better understanding of the depth of our 
management resource. This has meant making 
time for the non-executive directors to meet 
with executives who either currently occupy 
senior management positions just below our 
Executive Committee, or show the potential 
to reach that level. Using informal events 
scheduled around our Board meetings, we 
have been successful in significantly increasing 
the Board’s engagement with executives. 
This activity has helped the members of the 
Nominations Committee to perform the 
important role they undertake in overseeing 
succession planning and executive 
development across the Group. 
This work will be a key priority for the 
Committee in 2018. We know we employ 
some highly talented people, and will 
engage with the Chief Executive and our 
new Group Human Resources Director in 
ensuring that they are developed and given 
the opportunities to lead this Company in 
the years to come.

Committee report
Sir Roger Carr 
Chairman of the Nominations Committee Dear Shareholders,
The Remuneration Committee (the Committee) 
is pleased to provide this update on our 
progress in implementing the remuneration 
policy approved at the May 2017 AGM (the 
Policy). We appreciated the high level of 
support we received (95.09% in favour) and 
the continuing constructive dialogue we have 
had with a number of you. The Committee 
remains sensitive to the broad range of themes 
regarding executive remuneration expressed 
by investors, the UK government and the 
wider public, particularly as regards to restraint 
when setting quantum. We believe such 
restraint is appropriate as long as remuneration 
remains reflective of the business environment 
and contains appropriate incentives to achieve 
the Group’s business objectives. In keeping 
with this theme, I believe you will find that 
our changes for 2018 are quite modest but 
are nevertheless responsive to the feedback 
that the Committee received during the last 
shareholder consultation cycle. To confirm, 
for 2018, no revisions are proposed to our 
executive remuneration framework which 
would constitute a change to the Policy.
Key changes proposed and approved 
at our 2017 AGM include:
– adoption of common metrics 
(50% on Earnings per Share, 50% 
on Total Shareholder Return) for all 
performance-related share awards;
– introducing reasonable discretion 
for the Committee to modify the final 
outcome of awards vesting in light 
of important factors in the business; 
– amending the structure of our 
Long-Term Incentive Plan applicable 
to our UK executive directors to ensure 
a minimum period from grant to final 
release, based on a three-year performance 
period with a further two-year holding 
period for all awards to be granted from 
2018 onwards; and
– a simplification of the Long-Term Incentive 
construct applicable to the US executive 
director.
2017 was a crossroads year for BAE Systems 
and the application of our Policy reflected 
these circumstances. Ian King retired from the 
Company at the end of June having served for 
over 40 years, including leading BAE Systems 
as Chief Executive since 2008. His retirement 
was handled precisely according to our Policy. 
This transition had been anticipated and the 
decision-making with respect to succession 
and remuneration was undertaken with an eye 
to ensuring a smooth transition of leadership 
through a period of significant change in the 
business environment. Thus, our then Chief 
Operating Officer, Charles Woodburn, was 
appointed Chief Executive with effect from 
1 July 2017 and his remuneration was adjusted 
in accordance with the Policy. Our Group 
Finance Director, Peter Lynas, was subsequently 
asked to undertake enhanced responsibility for 
Procurement, Group Mergers & Acquisitions 
and UK Shared Services. As previously 
announced, the base salary of the Group 
Finance Director was increased to reflect 
these expanded responsibilities with effect 
from 1 November 2017 and this adjustment 
was also in accordance with the Policy.

Remuneration 
Committee report
Paula Rosput Reynolds 
Chairman of the Remuneration Committee The Company remains subject to rapidly-
changing political, economic, defence and 
security conditions around the world. Such 
circumstances require that we be responsive 
to the environment and innovate for the 
long-run health of the business. Thus, in 
October, we announced a restructure of 
various of our operations, resulting in a 
number of senior leadership changes. The 
Committee adjusted remuneration for the 
affected senior executives to reflect new 
roles and enhanced responsibilities. In doing 
so, the Committee adhered to the Policy. 
Throughout this period of transition, the 
Committee’s overarching goal has remained 
constant – to ensure that we are providing 
compelling incentives for sustainable high 
performance by our executive team in a way 
that is transparent to our stakeholders and is 
supported by them. Further, our remuneration 
programmes are designed to assure that 
there is strong alignment between business 
results and rewards conferred. In reading 
this report, we hope you will agree that the 
results of our deliberations are consistent 
with these purposes.
Context to the Committee’s decisions
The Committee is responsible for the full 
spectrum of executive employment matters: 
recruiting, promoting and retaining the best 
top-level leaders, setting the incentives under 
which these leaders operate, and monitoring 
the results they produce and the manner 
in which they produce them. Our overall 
remuneration framework has a number of 
specific goals. It is designed to motivate 
our key talent to achieve the Company’s 
strategic objectives, to deliver on customer 
commitments, to lead and inspire employees, 
and to drive value for our shareholders. It is 
also designed to be competitive in the various 
markets in which we operate and compete 
for talent. 
There are multiple considerations in the 
design of the overall framework. First, is 
the balance of short-term and long-term 
incentives. Second, is the interplay between 
Group and business segment results and 
individual accomplishments, as well as the 
level of reward afforded to employees in 
the wider Group. Third, is to distinguish 
between the precise numerical results 
and the character of the results themselves, 
including the manner in which they are 
achieved. Fourth, is the balance between 
absolute shareholder value creation and 
the Group’s performance relative to peers. 
Our short-term programme metrics are tied 
to Group performance, business segment 
performance and individual goals, including 
the leadership behaviours that underpin 
BAE Systems’ Total Performance culture. 
Our long-term incentive programme measures 
absolute performance of the Group and 
performance relative to peers. Our framework 
is intended to foster accountability for 
sustaining and growing the Group in a 
responsible manner.
In addition to developing the overall 
remuneration framework, the Committee 
assesses the level of challenge within our 
annual and long-term incentive plan targets. 
Annually, in November, the full Board reviews 
and adopts the Integrated Business Plan. 
Thereafter, the Committee reviews the 
specific business targets/metrics for the one 
and three-year periods and examines the 
underlying assumptions, including the degree 
of ‘stretch’ contained within them. After 
setting one and three-year targets, the 
Committee periodically reviews progress 
towards the attainment of the objectives. 
After the close of each year, the Committee 
undertakes a thorough review of annual 
and three-year performance. Separately, 
the Committee regularly considers the overall 
construct of the remuneration package to 
ensure that potential pay outcomes are 
appropriate and reasonable against different 
performance scenarios.
Summary of key decisions 
for 2017
– Approval of early retirement for 
outgoing Chief Executive (Ian King) 
in June 2017.
– Approval of remuneration package 
applicable to newly-appointed 
Chief Executive (Charles Woodburn) 
in July 2017.
– Salary of the Chief Executive is 
being increased by 2.5% from 
1 January 2018.
– As a result of his expanded role and 
increased responsibilities, the salary of 
the Group Finance Director increased 
by 6.9% on 1 November 2017. His 
salary is being increased by 2.5% 
from 1 January 2018.
– Salary of the President and Chief 
Executive Officer of BAE Systems, Inc. 
is being increased by 3% from 
1 January 2018.
– Approval of remuneration packages 
for newly appointed Executive 
Committee members.
– Awards granted in spring 2017 of 
Performance Shares, Share Options 
and (to US executive director only) 
Restricted Shares.
– Performance Shares subject to 
(i) 50% on Earnings per Share (EPS) 
growth (3% to 7% average annual 
growth requirement); and (ii) 50% 
on the Total Shareholder Return (TSR) 
percentile ranking against sector peer 
comparator group and the companies 
in the FTSE 100 index, with each 
group having equal weight.
– Elimination of Share Options for 
UK executive directors and maintaining 
expected value in Performance Shares 
for 2018 awards.

Annual Report 2017
Remuneration Committee report 
continued 2018 remuneration
As noted above, the changes for 2018 are 
quite modest but are nevertheless responsive 
to the feedback that the Committee received 
during the last shareholder consultation cycle. 
The following actions will apply to our 
framework for 2018 and all are entirely in 
accordance with the bounds of the approved 
Policy. In line with our commitment to 
continued transparency and engagement 
with our shareholders, we have engaged 
with our major shareholders on these 
changes for 2018.
In order to increase focus on the 
achievement of non-financial objectives 
designed to support the Group’s strategy, 
the weighting on non-financial performance 
measures will increase from 20% to 25%, 
with 75% remaining on financial metrics 
relating to Group EPS, Group cash and 
Group order intake.
Long-Term Incentive (LTI) design 
simplification
As a further step towards simplification of 
our LTI framework, having already taken the 
decision to eliminate the use of Share Options 
as part of the construct applicable to our 
US executive director, the Committee will 
also cease the award of Share Options to 
the UK executive directors for 2018 onwards. 
Consistent with the flexibility contained 
within the Policy, LTI awards will be 
delivered using Performance Shares only. 
This change will result in a lower total face 
value of the award without, we believe, 
diluting the incentive to achieve long-term 
sustainable value.

Chief Executive 185 550 370

The conversion from Share Options to 
Performance Shares has been calculated 
in line with the methodology explained 
in our Policy on page 120 and is shown 
in the table below.
This approach significantly simplifies our 
LTI arrangements without changing the 
underlying market-competitive expected 
values of 185% for the Chief Executive 
and 167.5% for the Group Finance Director.

Salary Wider employee agenda
Recognising the public interest in pay 
differentials, and the expected proposed 
legislation in this area, we are continuing 
to voluntarily disclose the pay ratio of our 
Chief Executive to that of the average 
employee of the Group. 
The level of salary adjustment for the 
executive directors is in line with the 
average increase for employees generally 
across the Group in 2018.
To support the Committee in taking a 
greater responsibility for demonstrating 
how pay and incentives are aligned across 
the Company, the Committee undertook 
a reward framework deep-dive session 
covering information on the structure of 
remuneration across the Group, including 
pension benefits.
In February 2018, BAE Systems published 
its gender pay report in accordance with 
UK legislation. Our average gender pay gap 
is 11.2%. This is lower than the UK national 
average of 18.1%. We have a gender pay gap 
because we employ around four times more 
men than women in the UK and a greater 
proportion of our senior leadership team 
is male. We are determined to bridge the 
gender gap in our industry by encouraging 
more women to join BAE Systems and we 
have put in place a number of programmes 
and initiatives to support the development 
and progression of women into senior 
executive positions.
Concluding comments
On behalf of my colleagues on the Committee, 
and indeed the entire Board, we appreciate 
the input we have received from shareholders 
and representatives of institutional investors. 
The Committee remains committed to our 
policy of paying for performance. The 
changes for 2018 simplify the LTI construct 
considerably whilst ensuring that the 
incentive arrangements for executives remain 
meaningful and are aligned to the Company’s 
strategic goals and the interests of our 
shareholders. The Remuneration Committee 
is actively engaged in monitoring performance 
and continuing to ensure that the level of 
challenge within our annual and long-term 
incentive plans remains appropriate.

Directors’ remuneration in the year ending 31 December 2018
For the purposes of the Companies Act 2006, the Directors’ remuneration policy 
(the Policy) has been operating in practice since the date of its approval on 10 May 
2017 at the 2017 AGM. The remuneration for 2018 will be implemented as follows:
– The salary of the Chief Executive is being increased by 2.5% to £897,000 with 
effect from 1 January 2018.
– The salary of the Group Finance Director is being increased by 2.5% to £641,650 
with effect from 1 January 2018.
– The salary of the President and Chief Executive Officer of BAE Systems, Inc. 
is being increased by 3% to $1,053,700 with effect from 1 January 2018. 
– Annual and Long-Term Incentive opportunity levels remain in line with 2017 
approved Policy.
– Long-Term Incentive awards of Performance Shares only for UK executive 
directors, and Performance Shares and Restricted Shares for US executive director.
– The performance measures and weightings for 2018 for the Annual Incentive 
and Long-Term Incentives are set out on page 116.
– The Committee is of the view that bonus targets for the Annual Incentive 
are commercially sensitive and that it would be detrimental to the Company 
to disclose them in advance. The targets will be disclosed retrospectively after 
the end of the relevant financial year. 
– The fee for the Chairman is set at £700,000 per annum until February 2020.
As agreed by the Non-Executive Directors’ Fees Committee (whose composition is

Sir Roger Carr was appointed as Chairman on 1 February 2014 on a fixed annual fee of £650,000 throughout 
his initial three-year term as Chairman. As reported last year, his fee was reviewed in 2016 and was increased 
to £700,000 per annum with effect from 1 February 2017. This fee will not be reviewed again for the remainder 
of his current three-year term.
Non-executive directors
As reported last year, the fee structure for the non-executive directors was reviewed and was increased for the first 
time since 2012. With effect from 1 April 2017, the fee structure on a per annum basis is as follows: (i) Chairman, Audit 
Committee: £105,000 (2016 £100,000); (ii) Chairman, Corporate Responsibility Committee: £105,000 (2016 £95,000); 
(iii) Chairman, Remuneration Committee: £105,000 (2016 £95,000); (iv) other non-executive directors: £80,000 (2016 
£75,000); and (v) additional fee for Senior Independent Director: £25,000 (2016 £20,000). These amounts are shown 
in the ‘Fees’ column above. A travel allowance of £4,500 (2016 £4,500) per meeting is also paid on each occasion that 
a non-executive director’s travel necessitates air travel of more than five hours (one way) to the meeting location, subject 
to a maximum of six travel allowances per year. These amounts are shown in the ‘Other’ column. The amounts in the 
‘Benefits’ column relate to travel expenses and subsistence.

The above table has been subject to audit.
1.  The benefits received by Ian King include the provision of a car allowance and the private use of a chauffeur-driven car 
(2017 £28k; 2016 £47k). In addition, upon his retirement, Ian King received a leaving gift totalling £5k, with any tax due 
on this payment being settled by the Company. The benefits received by Charles Woodburn include the provision of a car 
allowance and the private use of a chauffeur-driven car (2017 £23k; 2016 £17k). The benefits received by Peter Lynas 
include the provision of a car allowance and the private use of a chauffeur-driven car (2017 £21k; 2016 £19k). In addition, 
Peter Lynas received a second residence allowance of £8k (2016 £15k) on the basis disclosed in previous years. Jerry 
DeMuro’s benefits include private use of a chauffeur-driven car and parking (2017 £3k; 2016 £4k); medical and dental 
benefits (2017 £14k; 2016 £12k); insured life and disability benefits (2017 £9k; 2016 £8k); and the private use of a 
company aircraft (2017 £9k; 2016 £1k).
2.  Further detail on bonus payments is provided on page 101. One-third of the net bonus paid to Charles Woodburn, 
Peter Lynas and Jerry DeMuro will be deferred compulsorily into BAE Systems shares for a three-year period, without 
additional performance conditions. The same deferral treatment applies to the net bonus paid to Ian King in respect 
of the pro-rated bonus for his six months of service in 2017.
3.  This column relates to the estimated or actual value of Long-Term Incentive Plans for which the performance period 
ended in the relevant financial year. With respect to the 2015 LTIP PS
EPS
 award, average annual EPS growth over the 
three-year performance period was approximately 4.75% and, consequently, 46.9% of the shares under this award 
will vest. The 2015 LTIP PS
TSR
 and LTIP SO awards (for which the performance periods also ended on 31 December 2017) 
did not meet their TSR performance condition and will lapse (see page 104 for further detail).
4.  The figures for Ian King and Peter Lynas in this column reflect defined benefit arrangements and have been calculated 
in line with the method set out in Section 229 of the Finance Act 2004 using a capitalisation factor of 20 to assess 
the increase in the value of the pension promise over the year under review, net of inflation. The figures for Ian King 
show the added pension value received in the defined benefit schemes from 1 January 2017 to the date of his 
retirement on 30 June 2017 (see note 2 on page 107 for details on pension paid for the six months from retirement 
to 31 December 2017). The figures for Peter Lynas allow for the impact of a pension sharing order effective in 2017. 
These figures are also sensitive to salary increases and Consumer Prices Index (CPI) inflation as follows:
– Salary increase: Pensionable salary is averaged over three years. The figures for Peter Lynas reflect salary increases 
since 31 December 2016.
– CPI inflation: In a year with high CPI inflation, the increase in the value of the pension promise would be lower than 
in a year with lower CPI inflation. For the 2017 figures, the reference CPI inflation was 1%.
  The figures for Charles Woodburn relate to a salary supplement in lieu of Company pension contributions.
  The figures for Jerry DeMuro include company contributions paid into his Section 401(k) defined contribution arrangement.
5.  This column includes (i) the value of Free Share awards under the UK all-employee Share Incentive Plan (SIP) of £505 for 
Charles Woodburn and Peter Lynas, and Matching Shares under voluntary investment in the SIP for Ian King (for the 
six months to 30 June 2017) and Charles Woodburn; and (ii) for Jerry DeMuro, the value of the 2017 grant of Restricted 
Shares (£837k). This award formed part of Jerry DeMuro’s 2017 LTIP allocation but is required to be reported under 
‘Other’ as it has no performance conditions attached; his prior year figure relates to a similar Restricted Shares award in 
2016. The balance of the 2017 figure (£113k) relates to the value of notional reinvested dividends in respect of his 2014 
Restricted Share Plan award which vested in March 2017, the third anniversary of grant. The value of the related award 
was reported in the 2014 Remuneration report. The prior year figure for Charles Woodburn includes the cash payment 
of £1,620,000 to recognise forfeited compensation from his previous employer, as set out in note 7 below.

BAE Systems
Annual Report 2017
Financial statements Governance 6.  As previously reported, Ian King retired from the Company on 30 June 2017 having served for over 40 years, 
including leading BAE Systems as Chief Executive since 2008. His leaving arrangements were as follows:
(a)  His retirement constituted early retirement with Company consent for share plan and pension purposes and, 
accordingly: (i) he was entitled to an immediate pension. Under the rules of the 2000 Pension Plan and Executive 
Pension Scheme, a pension of 1/30th of three-year final average salary for each year of service subject to the 
payment of members’ contributions (currently 8%) is payable at 62 years of age. Benefits paid prior to age 62 
are subject to actuarial reduction, currently a reduction of 4% to annual benefits for each year that retirement 
takes place prior to age 62, with proportionate reductions applied in respect of part years. He was 61 at the date 
of his retirement and his pension payments were reduced accordingly; (ii) unvested share awards and options 
under the Company’s Long-Term Incentive Plan will vest at the normal vesting date, subject to testing of the 
relevant performance conditions at the end of the normal performance period. Share awards were reduced 
pro-rata on the basis of complete months from the grant date to 30 June 2017. Any share options that vest will 
remain exercisable for a period of six months from the vesting date; and (iii) unvested deferred bonus awards 
were preserved and will vest at the normal vesting dates. 
(b)  He will continue to be covered by the Company’s Directors’ and Officers’ insurance policy and his director’s 
indemnification arrangements will remain in force. 
(c)  He will continue to be bound by those provisions of his service agreement which continue to apply following 
cessation of employment, including post-termination restrictive covenants and confidentiality provisions. 
(d)  He was eligible for an Annual Incentive payment for 2017, determined by the Committee, based on an assessment 
of individual and Company performance. Any bonus was to be pro-rated for his six months of service during 2017 
and will be paid at the normal date following the end of the 2017 financial year. One-third of the net bonus will be 
compulsorily deferred into shares in the normal way (see page 101 for further detail). 
(e)  No award was granted under the Long-Term Incentive Plan in 2017. 
(f)  No termination payment was paid. 
(g)  Taxable benefits comprising the provision of a car allowance and the private use of a chauffeur-driven car ceased 
from 30 June 2017. 
7.  As previously reported, Charles Woodburn was appointed as Chief Operating Officer on 9 May 2016 and joined the 
Board as an executive director on the same date. His salary on appointment was £750,000, with a maximum bonus 
opportunity of 200% of salary, of which one-third will be deferred in shares for a period of three years. He also 
received LTIP awards at the following levels: Performance Share award of 230% of salary and Share Option award 
of 300% of salary. In addition, he received the following awards to take into account the fair value of the awards 
being forfeited which significantly extend the vesting/holding period of the incentives being given up: 
(i)  cash payment of £1,620,000 in respect of incentives earned and payable within six months, of which 50% of 
this net amount was to be used to purchase BAE Systems shares within 120 days following payment. Due to 
BAE Systems being in a closed period from 1 January 2017 until the announcement of the Company’s results 
on 23 February 2017, the Remuneration Committee agreed to extend the period in which Charles was required 
to buy the shares to the end of February 2017. These shares continue to be held in accordance with BAE Systems’ 
Minimum Shareholding Requirement; and
(ii)  a one-off grant of Performance Shares equal to 266% of salary, subject to the same performance conditions 
applicable to awards made under the LTIP with vesting in equal tranches of one-third in 2019, one-third in 
2020 and the final third in 2021.
 His pension arrangements are set out on pages 107 and 108. 
  On his appointment as Chief Executive on 1 July 2017, his salary increased to £875,000 per annum. All other 
provisions of his remuneration package are as set out in the Company’s remuneration policy in respect of the 
Chief Executive role. 
8.  Jerry DeMuro is paid in US dollars with the disclosed figures above being converted into sterling at the required 
exchange rate. The 2017 salary reflects his 3.0% salary increase and the exchange rate fluctuations experienced 
in 2017.

The above table has been subject to audit.
1. Adjusted to be on a like-for-like basis with the targets.
2. Performance against the safety element of the bonus was determined by the Corporate Responsibility Committee (whose composition is stated on 
page 87) taking account of the level of significant risk reduction and improvement in safety culture, as well as targeted improvements against key 
safety indicators including a reduction in recordable accidents. While the Group achieved a 3% reduction in recordable accidents, it did not meet the 
10% target level. A 30% reduction in the most severe accidents was delivered resulting in an overall performance award factor of 40% of maximum.
Annual bonus
Annual bonuses for the 2017 year are paid in March 2018. Annual bonus is made up of financial metrics, safety and 
personal objectives, designed to support the achievement of certain strategic outcomes necessary for sustaining the Group’s 
long-term vitality. The breakdown of bonus measures, achievement and pay-out for each executive director is shown below. 
One-third of the net bonus payment is subject to compulsory deferral into BAE Systems shares for a three-year period, for 
which there is no additional performance condition. As previously reported, one-third of the net bonus due to Ian King for 
the six-month period he served in 2017 will be compulsorily deferred into shares in the normal way.

 award (for which the performance 
period ended on 31 December 2017), the growth of EPS over the three-year performance period was approximately 
4.75% and, consequently, 46.9% of the shares under this portion of the award will vest. The Committee is satisfied 
that there has been a sustained improvement in the Company’s underlying financial performance and that it is 
appropriate for vesting of 46.9% of the EPS portion.

The percentage change from 2016 to 2017 in remuneration of the Chief Executive and average UK employee is shown in 
the table below. As required by statute, the table shows the details for the Chief Executive role and, therefore, includes a 
combination of the remuneration of Ian King and Charles Woodburn for the 2017 financial year. The relevant remuneration 
figures applying for 2017 in respect of the Chief Executive role are included in the table for reference. As Charles 
Woodburn’s overall remuneration is lower than Ian King’s, the calculation for 2017 results in a downward movement in 
the year-on-year percentage change. If the table below reflected Ian King’s remuneration for the full financial year, the 
percentage movement on a like-for-like basis would be a 0% increase in salary and a decrease of 7.9% in bonus.

BAE Systems
Annual Report 2017
Financial statements Governance Pay ratio of Chief Executive to average employee
The ratio of remuneration of the Chief Executive to the average employee of the entire Group over the last four years 
was as follows:
2014 2015 2016 2017
Chief Executive’s remuneration (£’000) 3,519 2,929 3,463 3,365
Average employee remuneration (£’000) 58 62 67 72
Ratio 60:1 47:1 52:1 47:1
The Chief Executive’s remuneration is calculated on the same basis as the single total figure of remuneration table. The 
Chief Executive’s remuneration in 2017 includes a combination of the remuneration of Ian King and Charles Woodburn. 
As Charles Woodburn’s overall remuneration is lower than Ian King’s, the calculation for 2017 results in a downward 
movement in the pay ratio.
Average employee remuneration is based on staff costs calculated on the same basis as note 3 to the Group accounts, 
excluding social security costs and US healthcare costs.
The Committee is mindful of the relationship between Chief Executive remuneration and remuneration of the wider 
BAE Systems employee population. Therefore, in line with our commitment to transparency, the table above provides 
the ratio of remuneration of the Chief Executive to the average employee of the Group for the past four years. As can 
be seen, the ratio has typically been around 50:1, with the ratio being higher in 2014 as a result of the partial vesting 
of Long-Term Incentive awards in that year. The ratio could range from around 20:1 to 100:1 depending on the level of 
performance against the measures which drive the Annual and Long-Term Incentive Plans.

*Retired on 30 June 2017.
1.  The defined benefit figure includes both funded and unfunded arrangements for Ian King and Peter Lynas. Accrued 
benefit for Ian King and Peter Lynas is annual pension payable on retirement prior to any reduction for early payment 
or exchanging pension for cash.
2.  Ian King’s accrued benefit in this column is his accrued benefit at his retirement date of 30 June 2017, prior to any 
reduction for early retirement. There was no further accrual of benefit between 30 June 2017 and 31 December 2017. 
He retired at 30 June 2017 with a pension of £745,229 per annum (with his pension payments totalling £372,615 
for the six months from retirement to 31 December 2017) and a cash lump sum of £1,132,032 (excluding Additional 
Voluntary Contributions). These figures allow for a reduction in respect of Early Retirement Factors to allow for the 
benefit being drawn before his Normal Retirement Age. The brought forward accrued benefit figure as at 1 January 
2017 has been reduced by £3,516 from that disclosed in 2016 to properly reflect the longevity adjustment factor 
that applies.
3.  Peter Lynas has accrued defined benefit pension which is reduced if taken before normal retirement age. In addition, 
a longevity adjustment factor is applied to pension accrued after 5 April 2006 to mitigate against life expectancy 
changes. The figures allow for the current factors in force, whereas in practice the factors are updated annually and 
those in force at retirement will be applied. Accrued benefit figures for Peter Lynas include the impact of a pension 
sharing order effective in 2017.
4.  Accrued benefit for Charles Woodburn is the total value of his defined contribution account, including employee 
contributions and investment returns. Accrued benefit for Jerry DeMuro is the total value of his Section 401(k) 
account, including both employee and company contributions as well as investment returns.
The above table has been subject to audit.
Peter Lynas is a member of the BAE Systems Executive Pension Scheme (ExPS) and the BAE Systems 2000 Pension Plan 
(2000 Plan) which together provide a pension for executive directors payable at 62 of 1/30th of three-year average final 
salary for each year of service subject to the payment of members’ contributions (currently 8%). Benefits paid prior to 
age 62 for ExPS and age 65 for 2000 Plan will be subject to actuarial reduction.
The ExPS tops up the underlying employee plan to provide a target benefit for executive directors payable from normal 
retirement age of 1/30th of Final Pensionable Pay (FPP) for each year of ExPS pensionable service (subject to a maximum 
of two-thirds of FPP). FPP is defined as annual base salary averaged over the last 12 months prior to leaving service in 
respect of service accrued to 5 April 2006 and 36 months prior to leaving in respect of service from 6 April 2006. The 
ExPS also provides a lump sum death-in-service benefit equal to four times base salary at date of death, and a spouse’s 
death-in-service pension equal to two-thirds of the prospective pension at normal retirement age. Spouses’ pensions 
are also payable upon death in retirement and death after leaving the Company’s employment with a deferred pension. 
Once in payment, pensions are increased annually by the rise in the Retail Prices Index subject to a maximum increase of 
5% per year in respect of pre-6 April 2006 service and 2.5% per year in respect of service from 6 April 2006. Peter Lynas 
joined the ExPS in 1999.
107
BAE Systems
Annual Report 2017
Financial statements Governance The 2000 Plan provides a pension of 1/50th of Final Pensionable Earnings (FPE) for each year of pensionable service, 
payable from a normal retirement age of 65 and members pay contributions of 8% of Pensionable Earnings. FPE under 
the 2000 Plan is the best consecutive three-year average of base salary and bonus in the ten Plan Years prior to leaving, 
less an offset for State pensions. The Company decided in 2006 to limit pensionable bonuses in the 2000 Plan in the 
2006/07 Plan Year to 20% of base salary and to 10% of base salary for the 2007/08 Plan Year and thereafter. However, 
there is a guarantee that the FPE figure for benefits in respect of service prior to 6 April 2007 will not be less than the 
FPE figure at 5 April 2007 to ensure that employees do not lose the benefit of contributions paid on past bonuses. 
Peter Lynas has 32 years and two months’ service in the 2000 Plan.
The review of pension policies carried out in 2010 by the Committee concluded that the pension benefits should 
continue to be based on the Company’s registered pension schemes and that, in appropriate circumstances, the 
Company will continue to have the option to offer an unfunded pension promise so as to mitigate the impact of further 
reductions to the Lifetime Allowance and the impact of the reduced Annual Allowance. Peter Lynas was given the choice 
to remain in the current arrangement and pay the increased tax or to take an unfunded promise; he elected for the latter. 
The Committee has decided that in cases where the Company is to pay an unfunded promise, executives will be given 
the choice to commute some or all of the benefit for a taxable lump sum, or take it as pension. Where an unfunded 
pension is taken, ten years after retirement, the executive will be given a further opportunity to commute the residual 
value of the unfunded pension for a lump sum.
Therefore, Peter Lynas’ total pension is the sum of his 2000 Plan benefits plus the top-up from the ExPS, most of which 
is provided through the unfunded promise referred to above.
Ian King is a member of the ExPS (which he joined in 1999) and the 2000 Plan, with benefits in line with those set 
out above and had opted to take an unfunded promise. At his retirement on 30 June 2017 he had 34 years’ service 
in the 2000 Plan and became a pensioner member. As reported last year, when he retired as a director and ceased 
employment on 30 June 2017, his retirement constituted early retirement with Company consent for pension purposes 
and, accordingly, he was entitled to an immediate pension. Under the rules of the 2000 Plan and the ExPS, and as set 
out above, a pension of 1/30th of three-year final average salary for each year of service subject to the payment of 
members’ contributions (currently 8%) is payable at 62 years of age. Benefits paid prior to age 62 for ExPS and age 65 
for 2000 Plan will be subject to actuarial reduction, currently a reduction of 4% to annual benefits for each year that 
retirement takes place prior to 62 for ExPS and 65 for 2000 Plan, with proportionate reductions applied in respect 
of part years. Ian King was 61 at the date of his retirement and his pension payments were reduced accordingly. 
Charles Woodburn participates in the BAE Systems Executive Pension Scheme Defined Contribution Retirement Plan 
(EPS DCRP), which is a defined contribution arrangement for senior executives. Charles Woodburn contributes the 
maximum £10,000 per annum into the EPS DCRP arrangement as permitted by the Annual Allowance limit and a 
19% salary supplement is paid in lieu of the Company contributions.
Jerry DeMuro participates in a Section 401(k) defined contribution arrangement set up for US employees in which 
the company will match his contributions up to a maximum contribution of 6% of salary, up to US regulatory limits 
(2018 $18,500; 2017 $18,000). In 2017, the company paid contributions of $14,628 into this arrangement. 
External directorships
Fees retained in 2017 by executive directors, during the period in which they served in that capacity, in respect 
of non-executive directorships were: Peter Lynas £85,000 in respect of his directorship of SSE plc; Jerry DeMuro 
$50,000 in respect of his directorship of Aero Communications, Inc.; and Ian King £35,000 in respect of his 
non-executive directorship of Schroders plc for the six months to 30 June 2017.
These amounts are not included in the remuneration table on page 99.

Key: LTIP – Long-Term Incentive Plan. PS – Performance Shares. SO – Share Options. RS – Restricted Shares.
Note: Performance Shares and Restricted Shares – Shares under award attract dividends prior to vesting. Performance Shares are intended to be free share 
awards and are structured as a nil cost option to give the participant more flexibility as to the timing of the benefit. For the US executive director, awards 
of Performance Shares are classified as conditional share awards (rather than share options) and are deliverable on the third, fourth and fifth anniversary of

No grant of awards was made to Ian King in March 2017 in view of his previously announced retirement on 30 June 2017.

Performance Share Plan (PSP)/LTIP Performance Shares
Shares under award vest after satisfaction of the three-year performance condition. Awards that vest are capable of 
exercise in three equal tranches on a phased basis from the third, fourth and fifth anniversary of grant. Any unexercised 
awards will lapse on the seventh anniversary of grant*. For US participants, the awards are automatically delivered at the 
end of years three, four and five, subject to the performance condition being achieved. Since 2015, shares have been 
awarded under the LTIP (a single umbrella plan) that was approved at the 2014 AGM as detailed on page 119 and are 
termed ‘Performance Shares’. Shares under award attract dividends prior to tranche vesting.
 * From 2018, awards to non-US executive directors remain subject to the three-year performance period but will not vest until the fifth anniversary of grant 
(see the UK executive director graphic on page 93). They will be exercisable until the seventh anniversary of grant.
Awards made to the UK executive directors since 2008, and to date to the US executive director, have been weighted 
50% on the EPS performance condition and 50% on the TSR performance condition. The TSR comparator groups are 
shown below.

is satisfied that there has been a sustained improvement in the Company’s underlying financial performance. In taking 
such a view, the Committee may consider (but not exclusively) the following financial metrics: net cash/debt; order book; 
risk; and project performance.

companies and 50% is on a TSR percentile ranking against the companies in the FTSE 100 index. Under both the 
sectoral and FTSE 100 comparator groups, no shares vest if the Company’s TSR is below the top 50% of TSRs achieved 
by the comparator group, with 25% vesting at median, 100% vesting if it is in the top quintile and vesting on a 
straight-line basis between these two parameters; and

Statement of directors’ shareholdings and share interests
Minimum Shareholding Requirement (MSR)
Executive directors are compulsorily required to establish and maintain a minimum personal shareholding equal to a 
set percentage of base salary. An Initial Value must be achieved as quickly as possible using shares vesting or options 
exercised through the executive share option schemes and Long-Term Incentive schemes by retaining 50% of the net 
value (i.e. the value after deduction of exercise costs and tax) of shares acquired under these schemes. Once the Initial 
Value is achieved, a Subsequent Value must be achieved in the same way, except that a minimum of 25% of the net 
value must be retained on each exercise or acquisition. Shares owned beneficially by the director (including the portion 
of net annual bonus deferred compulsorily into BAE Systems shares) and his/her spouse count towards the MSR. The 
MSR does not apply after the individual has ceased to be a director. Any case of non-compliance would be dealt with 
by the Committee. 
The following table sets out MSR Initial Value and Subsequent Value: 
Initial Value Subsequent Value
Ian King* 150% 300%
Charles Woodburn 150% 300%
Peter Lynas 100% 200%
Jerry DeMuro 175% (212.5% from 2018) 350% (425% from 2018)
*Retired on 30 June 2017.
Peter Lynas was in excess of his ‘Subsequent Value’ MSR at 31 December 2017, as was Ian King on 30 June 2017, 
the date of his retirement. Jerry DeMuro joined the Board in 2014 and his personal holding of shares in the Company 
at 31 December 2017 stood at 153%. The higher MSR values applicable to Jerry DeMuro recognise the higher LTI 
opportunity and broader US market practice. Charles Woodburn joined the Board in May 2016 and his personal 
shareholding in the Company at 31 December 2017 stood at 63%.
There are MSR requirements in place for all of the employee population who receive LTIPs.
There are no shareholding requirements for the Chairman or the non-executive directors.

Annual Report 2017
Financial statements Governance Directors’ remuneration for 2018
For 2018, it remains our intention to operate the Policy that was agreed 
by shareholders at the 2017 AGM. This section sets out how the Policy 
will apply in 2018.
As set out in our Remuneration Committee Chairman’s letter on pages 
91 to 94, the Committee intends to make the following changes to our 
executive remuneration arrangements for 2018 which do not constitute 
a change to the Policy approved by shareholders in 2017.
Long-Term Incentive (LTI) construct for UK executive directors
As a further step towards simplification of our LTI framework, having 
already taken the decision to eliminate the use of Share Options as 
part of the LTI construct applicable to our US executive director, 
the Committee also will cease the award of Share Options to the 
UK executive directors for 2018 onwards. 
Consistent with the flexibility contained within the Policy, LTI awards 
will be delivered using Performance Shares only. This change will 
result in a lower total face value of the award without, we believe, 
diluting the incentive to the achievement of long-term sustainable 
value. The conversion from Share Options to Performance Shares 
has been calculated in line with the methodology explained in the 
Policy on page 120 and is shown in the table below:
Current total 
expected value
Current aggregate  
face value of awards  
(Performance Shares 
and Share Options)
New face value  
associated with 
Performance Share  
award only
Chief Executive 185% 550% 370%
Group Finance Director 167.5% 515% 335%
This approach significantly simplifies our LTI arrangements without 
changing the underlying market-competitive expected values of 185% 
for the Chief Executive and 167.5% for the Group Finance Director.
Metrics and weightings applicable in 2018
– The performance metrics and weightings applicable to the 2018 
annual incentive are 75% on financial metrics relating to Group 
EPS, Group cash and Group order intake, 5% on safety and 20% 
on personal objectives designed to support the Group’s strategy.
– Performance Shares will continue to have 50% of the award 
based on TSR performance as follows: 50% of the TSR measure 
on the current peer comparator group of 13 other international 
defence companies and 50% on a TSR percentile ranking against 
the companies in the FTSE 100 index. For 2018, the remaining 
50% of the award is subject to the EPS condition with a performance 
range of 3% to 7% average annual EPS growth requirement. For US 
participants, other than members of the Executive Committee, 50% 
of the awards made in 2018 are subject to the long-term operating 
cash performance of the US business in place of TSR growth.
– There is no change in 2018 to the criteria and weightings applying 
to Restricted Shares. As set out previously, the US executive director 
will receive an equal weight in expected value in Performance Shares 
and Restricted Shares.
– As set out above, from 2018, UK executive directors will receive 
Performance Shares only.
Illustration of application of policy for 2018
The following charts show the value of the package each 
of the executive directors would receive based on 2018 base 
salaries, remuneration and 2018 LTI awards assuming the 
following scenarios: minimum fixed pay (including salary, 
benefits and pension as provided in the single total figure 
table on page 99), and the Restricted Shares award for 
the US executive director; pay receivable assuming on-target 
performance is met; and maximum pay assuming variable 
elements pay out in full. The scenarios below exclude any 
share price appreciation and dividends.
UK legislation requires that these charts are given in relation 
to the first year in which the remuneration policy takes legal 
effect (see page 125). The charts below are reporting the

BAE Systems
Annual Report 2017
Preface to the Directors’  
remuneration policy This Directors’ remuneration policy (the Policy) will take legal effect from the conclusion of the 2017 Annual General 
Meeting (AGM) subject to shareholder approval at the 2017 AGM
1
.
The Remuneration Committee (the Committee) considers remuneration policy annually to ensure that it remains aligned 
with business needs and is appropriately positioned relative to the market. However, in the absence of exceptional or 
unexpected circumstances which may necessitate a change to the Policy, there is currently no intention to revise the 
Policy more frequently than every three years. We use target performance to estimate the total potential reward and 
benchmark it against reward packages paid by BAE Systems’ competitors.
The Policy is to set base salary with reference to the relevant market-competitive level. Actual total direct reward reflects 
the performance of the individual and the Company as a whole. The aim is to deliver an overall remuneration package for 
executive directors which provides an appropriate balance between short-term and long-term reward and between fixed 
and variable reward as described in the table below.
Whilst our Long-Term Incentive Plan provides the Committee with discretion in respect of vesting outcomes that affect the 
actual level of reward payable to individuals, as explained on page 120, such discretion would only be used in exceptional 
circumstances and, if exercised, disclosed at the latest in the report on implementation of the Policy (i.e. the Annual 
remuneration report) for the year in question.
Changes compared to the policy approved at the 2014 AGM
The Policy contains no components which were not in the remuneration policy approved at the 2014 AGM. However, 
the material changes from the policy approved in 2014 are summarised below with the supporting rationale provided 
in the Remuneration Committee Chairman’s letter on pages 79 to 82 of the 2016 Annual Report.
Salary
– Clarity on cap on salary increases.
Annual incentive
– Introduction of separate maximum for Chief Operating Officer.
– Introduction of limits for new executive director role.
– Incorporation of malus and clawback mechanisms.
Long-Term Incentives (LTI)
– Introduction of reasonableness discretion.
– Introduction of separate maximum for Chief Operating Officer.
– Introduction of limits for new executive director role.
– Clarity on flexibility to vary weightings of different award types and the associated impact on opportunity 
levels subject to the parameters set out.
– Incorporation of malus and clawback mechanisms.
– Introduction of two-year holding period for shares acquired on vesting of awards to non-US directors.
– Introduction of Earnings per Share (EPS) alongside Total Shareholder Return (TSR) on share options with 
equal weighting.
– Removal of Share Options for US executive director and redistribution into Performance Shares and Restricted 
Shares to maintain current Expected Value.
– Increase in Minimum Shareholding Requirement for US executive director.
Pension
– Participation in executive defined contribution retirement plan (or cash equivalent) introduced as default pension 
vehicle for new directors.
– Inclusion of salary supplement as vehicle to offset impact of Lifetime Allowance and/or Annual Allowance.
Non-executive directors’ fees
– Introduction of maximum for Chairman’s fees and benefits.
1. Approved at the AGM on 10 May 2017.

BAE Systems
Annual Report 2017
Financial statements Governance
Directors’  
remuneration policy Base salary
Purpose and link to strategy
Recognise market value of role and individual’s skills, experience and performance to ensure the business can attract 
and retain talent.
Operation
Salaries are reviewed annually. Business and individual performance, skills, the scope of the role and the individual’s time in the role are 
taken into account when setting and assessing salaries, as is market data for similar roles in the relevant market comparator group.
The comparator group for UK executive directors is comprised of selected companies from the FTSE 100 and is constructed to position 
BAE Systems around the median in terms of market capitalisation. For the President and Chief Executive Officer of BAE Systems, Inc., 
the comparator group is drawn from companies in the US aerospace and defence sectors, together with similar organisations in the 
general industry sector where BAE Systems, Inc. is positioned at the median of the comparator group by reference to revenue size.
Maximum opportunity
When considering salary increases for the executive directors in their current roles, the Committee considers the general level of 
salary increase across the Group and in the relevant external market.
Actual increases for the executive directors in their current roles will generally not exceed the average percentage increase for 
employees as a whole, taking account of the level of movement within the relevant UK/US comparator group.
As a maximum, in exceptional circumstances (such as a material increase in job size or complexity while performing the same role, 
or a recently appointed executive director where the salary is positioned low against the market), the increase will not exceed 10% 
in any single year for executive directors performing the same role. If an individual’s role changes then a salary increase above 10% 
may be awarded in any single year to position their salary appropriately in accordance with the base salary principles described under 
‘Operation’ above. As a matter of policy, no new executive director role will have a salary greater than the Chief Executive at that time.
Performance metrics used, weighting and time period applicable
None.
Annual incentive
Purpose and link to strategy
Drive and reward annual performance of individuals and teams on both financial and non-financial metrics, including 
leadership behaviours in order to deliver sustainable growth in shareholder value. 
Compulsory deferral into shares increases alignment with shareholder interests.
Operation
The annual incentive is driven off in-year financial performance, corporate responsibility and other non-financial objectives 
measured at the Group and individual level. 
One-third of the total annual incentive amount is subject to compulsory deferral for three years in BAE Systems shares without 
any matching.
A malus mechanism may be applied to any bonus, and a clawback mechanism may be applied to the deferred bonus shares until 
up to the end of the three-year deferral period, in respect of 2015 or subsequent years where:
– the Company is entitled to terminate employment for cause or the participant has engaged in misconduct (including breach 
of policy) which gives rise to other disciplinary sanction;
– the results of the Company and/or relevant business or businesses for any period have been restated or subsequently appear 
materially inaccurate or misleading; and/or
– any Group company or business unit has made a material financial loss.
Cash dividends are payable to the participants on the shares during this three-year deferral period.

continued Annual incentive continued
Maximum opportunity
Chief Executive and the President and Chief Executive Officer of BAE Systems, Inc.: 225% of salary
Chief Operating Officer: 200% of salary
Group Finance Director: 160% of salary
Where a new executive director role is established, the maximum opportunity will not exceed that of the Chief Operating Officer 
role as set out above.
The pay-out for maximum performance is double the payout for on-target performance. The pay-out for target performance is half 
of the respective maximum percentages above. The pay-out for achieving a threshold performance is 40% of the payout for on-target 
performance (i.e. 20% of maximum), with no pay-out for achieving less than this. Pay-out for performance between targets is calculated 
on a straight-line basis.
Performance metrics used, weighting and time period applicable
Performance is assessed on an annual basis, using a combination of the Group’s main performance indicators for the year and other 
objectives designed to support the Group’s strategy. Metrics, which will include financial and non-financial metrics as well as the 
achievement of personal objectives, will be determined and weighted each year according to business priorities. 75-80% will relate 
to financial metrics.
Metrics and weightings to be determined annually. Proposed metrics and weightings applicable in 2017:
Group EPS – 40%
Group cash – 25%
Order intake – 15%
Safety – 5%
Personal objectives designed to support the Group’s strategy – 15%
See notes 4 and 5 on page 124 regarding the selection and weighting of performance metrics.
Notwithstanding performance against the applicable metrics, all bonus payments are at the discretion of the Committee, which will 
be based on an assessment of the individual’s personal contribution to business performance over the relevant year and leadership 
behaviours demonstrated in making that contribution, relative to others.
Long-Term Incentives (LTI)
Operation
Long-term incentives will operate under the BAE Systems Long-Term Incentive Plan approved by shareholders at the 2014 AGM.
The size of awards granted is based on a percentage of salary, which is divided by the share price to determine the number of 
shares subject to the award.
Dividend equivalents in respect of vested shares may be paid at the time of vesting (or exercise, in the case of options) and are 
not taken into account when determining individual limits.
A malus and clawback mechanism may be applied, until two years after vesting, or if sooner, the fifth anniversary of grant, or 
the occurrence of certain corporate events, to all awards granted on or after 25 March 2015 where:
– the Company is entitled to terminate employment for cause or the participant has engaged in misconduct (including breach 
of policy) which gives rise to other disciplinary sanction;
– the results of the Company and/or relevant business or businesses for any period have been restated or subsequently appear 
materially inaccurate or misleading;
– any Group company or business unit has made a material financial loss; and/or
– the measurement of any performance condition does not reflect the actual performance of the Company over the 
performance period.
The Committee will establish the targets for each measure at the start of each performance period based on Group projections and 
market expectations for the business. The performance conditions for previous awards are described in the Annual remuneration report.
Awards and performance conditions can be adjusted to take account of variations of share capital and other transactions or events.
On a change of control or similar transaction, awards generally will vest to the extent performance conditions are then satisfied 
(if applicable) and then be pro-rated to reflect the acceleration of vesting unless the Committee decides otherwise. Alternatively, 
awards may be exchanged for equivalent awards over shares in the acquiring company.
The share plan rules may be amended from time-to-time by the Committee in certain circumstances including minor changes 
for administrative, tax or other regulatory purposes.
Subject to this Policy, performance conditions of awards already granted may be amended in accordance with their terms or if 
anything happens which causes the Committee reasonably to consider it appropriate to do so.
Performance metrics used, weighting and time period applicable
See notes 4 and 5 on page 124 regarding the selection and weighting of performance metrics.

BAE Systems
Annual Report 2017
Financial statements Governance Long-Term Incentives (LTI) continued
Maximum opportunity
Over the lifetime of this Policy, the Committee will have discretion to vary the weighting of different types of awards within the 
framework set out below, but the overall LTI Expected Value (EV) will remain the same (assuming the LTI EV is calculated as 50% 
of face value for Performance Shares, 20% of face value for Share Options and 100% of face value for Restricted Shares):
– UK executive directors’ awards will consist of a mix of Performance Shares and Share Options (with Share Options comprising 
no more than 50% of overall LTI EV).
– US executive directors’ awards will consist of a mix of Performance Shares and Restricted Shares (with Restricted Shares comprising 
no more than 50% of overall LTI EV).
Performance metrics used, weighting and time period applicable
See below in relation to Performance Shares and Share Options. 
In addition to the primary performance tests set out below, the Committee confirms and recognises its obligation to judge the 
overall reasonableness of the rewards received relative to the overall business actions and results achieved. When determining the 
final performance condition outcome under Performance Share and Share Option awards, the Committee will have discretion over 
the number of awards vesting in light of other important factors in the business (reasonable discretion). The discretion may result in 
vesting of awards going upwards (subject to maximum 100% vesting of awards) as well as downwards. Any factors will be properly 
considered as they arise and any discretion to the calculated results will be applied in a highly disciplined manner and the rationale 
and impact will be reported transparently. The use of reasonableness discretion would apply to LTI awards granted to executive 
directors after the commencement of this Policy.
See notes 4 and 5 on page 124.
Long-Term Incentives – Performance Shares
Purpose and link to strategy
Drive and reward delivery of sustained long-term EPS and TSR performance aligned to the interests of shareholders.
Operation
For non-US executive directors, awards, typically in the form of nil-cost options, will vest subject to performance and service conditions 
on the fifth anniversary of grant. These will be exercisable between the fifth and tenth anniversary of grant or such shorter period as 
may be specified by the Committee.
For US executive directors, awards are delivered as conditional share awards (RSUs). To maintain the competitiveness of the LTI offering 
in the US, awards will vest automatically on the third, fourth and fifth anniversary of grant, subject to performance conditions.
Policy maximum opportunity
Award levels applicable to UK executive directors for normal annual grants (assuming the current LTI EV weightings in Performance 
Shares and Share Options) are as follows:
Chief Executive: 250% of salary
Chief Operating Officer: 230% of salary
Group Finance Director: 215% of salary
Award levels applicable to US executive directors for normal annual grants (assuming the current LTI EV weightings in Performance 
Shares and Restricted Shares) are as follows:
President and Chief Executive Officer of BAE Systems, Inc.: 298% of salary
Note the percentages above could be exceeded if the LTI EV weightings were to be varied (see above).
Where a new executive director role is established, the maximum opportunity will not exceed that of the Chief Operating Officer 
role as set out above.

Performance metrics used, weighting and time period applicable
Metrics and weightings will be as follows (subject to the Committee’s ability to adjust as set out below):
– 50% of award based on TSR relative to one or more appropriate comparator groups over the three-year performance period as 
selected by the Committee at the time of grant:
– Vesting of each comparator group is determined as: nil vesting if TSR ranked below median in the peer group; 25% vesting if 
TSR ranked at the median; 100% vesting if TSR ranked in the upper quintile; pro-rata vesting for performance between median 
and upper quintile.
– If more than one comparator group is used, vesting of the TSR portion of the award will be determined by the average of the 
vesting outcomes from each comparator group.
– Award subject to a secondary financial measure as set out on page 110.
– 50% of award based on average annual EPS growth over the three financial years starting with that in which the award is granted, 
with 25% vesting for threshold performance, 50% vesting for target performance and 100% vesting for stretch performance. 
Pro-rata vesting for intermediate performance.
The metrics and weightings applicable in 2017 are as follows:
– 50% of award based on TSR relative to the following two comparator groups over the three-year performance period:
– At least ten other international defence companies selected by the Committee at the time of grant.
– All companies in the FTSE 100 index.

with threshold performance requirement as average annual EPS growth of 3%, target performance requirement as average annual 
EPS growth of 5% and stretch performance requirement as average annual EPS growth of 7%.
Note that awards granted to executive directors from the date of the 2017 AGM would be subject to application of reasonableness 
discretion in light of other important factors in the business as described earlier.
The Committee can adjust the weighting of the EPS and TSR conditions and, if considered appropriate, the Committee may introduce 
an alternate performance condition aligned to the Company’s strategy.

Benefits
Purpose and link to strategy
Provide employment benefits which ensure that the overall package is market competitive when these elements are 
taken into account.
Operation
Benefits include provision of a company car (or cash equivalent), life assurance and ill-health benefit cover which are provided directly 
or through membership of the Company’s pension schemes. The main benefits in the UK include a car allowance (currently £16,000 
per annum), private use of a chauffeur-driven car and annual medical screening, plus life assurance and ill-health benefit cover provided 
through membership of the Company’s pension schemes.
Opportunity for UK executive directors to participate in the Share Incentive Plan, a tax approved all-employee plan.
In the US, benefits include a cash allowance for car and parking (currently $20,900 per annum) and private use of a chauffeur-driven 
car, medical and dental benefits, and insured life and disability benefits.
Additional benefits, such as relocation assistance, may also be provided in certain circumstances if considered reasonable and 
appropriate by the Committee. Relocation assistance comprises reimbursement for direct items of expenditure, such as legal, 
estate agency, removals and temporary accommodation.
Directors’ and Officers’ insurance cover is also provided for all executive directors.
Maximum opportunity
Benefits are set at a level which the Committee considers to be appropriate against comparable roles in companies of similar size 
in the relevant market.
Benefits are as reported and itemised within the single total figure shown as part of the Annual remuneration report on page 99. 
The maximum cost of such benefits will reflect the associated market-competitive cost of provision. Relocation assistance is based 
on actual costs incurred which are linked to the size and value of the property, plus a maximum relocation allowance of £2,500.
Participation limits for the Share Incentive Plan are those set by the UK tax authorities from time-to-time.

 are members of the BAE Systems Executive Pension 
Scheme and members of an underlying employee pension plan, which together provide a target benefit for executive directors 
payable at normal retirement age (62) of 1/30th of final pensionable earnings (FPE) for each year of service up to a maximum of 
two-thirds of FPE. Member contributions are currently 8% of salary. Further detail is provided on page 107 as part of the Annual 
remuneration report.
The current Chief Operating Officer
1
 as at 22 February 2017
2
 is a member of the defined contribution section of the BAE Systems 
Executive Pension Scheme (EPS DCRP). In line with our policy, Company contributions are 19% of salary and member contributions 
are 6% of salary. Where the Annual Allowance (AA) is breached, as is the case with the Chief Operating Officer, he will pay member 
contributions up to the AA limit and the Company contributions will be paid as a salary supplement.
For any new externally-appointed UK executive directors, or internally appointed UK executive directors who are not members of 
a BAE Systems defined benefit scheme, membership of the BAE Systems EPS DCRP is offered with contribution requirements set 
as a percentage of base salary dependent on grading. Individuals may elect to receive some or all of their Company contributions as 
a cash allowance. For any internally-appointed UK executive directors who are already members of a BAE Systems defined benefit 
scheme, the Company may offer to maintain their membership in that pension arrangement (with the contribution rates appropriate 
to that arrangement), or the choice of membership of the BAE Systems EPS DCRP as set out above.
Where UK executive directors’ pension entitlement or accrual is restricted to the Lifetime Allowance (LTA) and/or the AA, the 
Company may offer an unfunded pension promise or salary supplement to offset the impact of these restrictions.
The current President and Chief Executive Officer of BAE Systems, Inc. as at 22 February 2017
2
 participates in a Section 401(k) 
defined contribution arrangement in which the company matches his contributions up to a maximum of 6% of salary, subject 
to US regulatory limits.
Any new externally-appointed US executive directors, or internally-appointed US executive directors who are not members of a pension 
plan, would be offered membership of the US Section 401(k) defined contribution plan. For any internally-appointed US executive 
directors who are members of the 2006 Plan and Non-Qualified Plan, these plans provide a cash sum at retirement equal to the sum 
of the annual accruals, currently set at $1,000 from the 2006 Plan and $500 from the Non-Qualified Plan. The Company may offer 
to maintain membership of the 2006 Plan and Non-Qualified Plan, in addition to membership of the US Section 401(k) defined 
contribution plan.
Maximum opportunity
The BAE Systems EPS DCRP provides a maximum Company contribution of 19% (in addition to employee contribution of 6%) 
of base salary.
Under the existing executive defined benefit scheme, a maximum of two-thirds of FPE is accrued at 1/30th for each year of service.
Where UK executive directors’ pension entitlement or accrual is restricted to the LTA and/or the AA, the Company may offer an 
unfunded pension promise or salary supplement to offset the impact of these restrictions.
The US Section 401(k) defined contribution plan provides 100% company matching contributions up to a maximum of 6% of base 
salary, subject to US statutory limits.
For US executive directors who are members of the 2006 Plan and Non-Qualified Plan, these plans provide a cash sum at retirement 
equal to the sum of the annual accruals, currently set at $1,000 from the 2006 Plan and $500 from the Non-Qualified Plan.

Financial statements Governance Notes to the executive directors’ policy table 
Remuneration policy for other employees
1.  The Company’s approach to annual salary reviews is consistent across the Group, with consideration given to the scope of the role, 
level of experience, performance and market data for similar roles in other companies.
2.  All leaders may participate in an annual bonus scheme with similar metrics to those used for the executive directors. Other employees 
may participate in performance-based incentive plans which vary by organisational level and with relevant metrics for the particular 
area of the business.
3.  LTI grants may be made to the most senior managers in the business (approximately 400 individuals globally). The nature of the 
awards depends on the individual’s location, roles and responsibilities, in particular:
– performance conditions and targets for performance share grants made to UK and Rest of World participants are made 
in line with those applying to executive directors; 
– for US participants below Executive Committee level, performance share grants are normally subject to BAE Systems, Inc. 
operating cash flow and EPS performance conditions and targets; 
– Performance Shares applicable to participants below executive director level vest on the third anniversary subject to performance 
conditions and are exercisable (or released in the case of US participants) in equal tranches on the third, fourth and fifth anniversary 
of grant; 
– Share Options are granted to participants below executive director level; there are no performance conditions attached and they 
vest and are exercisable after three years; and
– Restricted Share grants are currently made to the most senior managers in the US businesses reflecting competitive market practice 
and vest after three years.
Performance measures and targets
4.  The Committee selected the performance conditions because these are central to the Company’s overall strategy and are the 
key metrics used by the executive directors to oversee the operation of the business. Any non-financial performance targets are 
determined by the Committee in consultation with the Corporate Responsibility Committee.
5.  The performance conditions and targets are determined annually by the Committee (within the parameters set out above), taking 
account of the Group’s strategic objectives, the internal business plan and budgets, as well as external market expectations and 
general economic conditions. The Committee is of the view that the performance targets for the annual bonus are commercially 
sensitive and that it would be detrimental to the interests of the Company to disclose them before the start of the financial year. 
The targets will be disclosed retrospectively after the end of the relevant financial year.
Minimum Shareholding Requirement (MSR)
6.  The Committee has agreed a policy whereby the executive directors are required to establish and maintain a minimum personal 
shareholding equal to a set percentage of base salary. An Initial Value must be achieved as quickly as possible using shares vesting or 
options exercised through the executive share option schemes and other LTI schemes by retaining 50% of the net value (i.e. the value 
after deduction of exercise costs and tax) of shares acquired under these schemes. Once the Initial Value is achieved, a Subsequent 
Value must be achieved in the same way, except that a minimum of 25% of the net value must be retained on each exercise or 
acquisition. The Committee has discretion to increase the Initial Value and/or Subsequent Value (see below). Shares owned beneficially 
by the director and his/her spouse count towards the MSR. The MSR does not apply after the individual has ceased to be a director. 
Any case of non-compliance would be dealt with by the Committee.
The following table sets out MSR Initial Value and Subsequent Value applicable from 2018: 
Initial Value Subsequent Value
Chief Executive 150% 300%
Chief Operating Officer 100% 200%
Group Finance Director 100% 200%

Financial statements Governance Non-executive directors’ (NEDs) policy table
Fees
Purpose and link to strategy
To attract NEDs who have a broad range of experience and skills to provide independent judgement on issues of strategy, 
performance, resources and standards of conduct.
Operation
NEDs’ fees are set by the Non-Executive Directors’ Fees Committee.
NEDs receive a basic fee with an additional fee for those who are chairmen of committees and/or undertake the role of Senior 
Independent Director.
NEDs also receive a travel allowance per meeting on each occasion that a scheduled Board meeting necessitates air travel of more 
than five hours (one way) to the meeting location, subject to a maximum of six travel allowances per year. 
Fees are typically reviewed annually, taking into account time commitment requirements and responsibility of the individual roles, 
and after reviewing practice in other comparable companies. 
The Chairman’s fees are set by the Remuneration Committee on a three-year basis and not normally subject to review during 
that period.
Maximum opportunity
Actual fee levels are disclosed in the Annual remuneration report for the relevant financial year.
The current Chairman’s fee has been set at £700,000 from 1 February 2017 and is fixed at this level for three years.
The aggregate cost of fees and benefits paid to NEDs (including the Chairman) will not exceed an annual limit of £2.5m and the cost 
of fees and benefits paid to the Chairman will not exceed £1.25m annually.
Performance metrics used, weighting and time period applicable
None.
Benefits
Purpose and link to strategy
Reimbursement for reasonable and documented expenses incurred in the performance of duties.
Operation
NEDs are not eligible to participate in any pension benefits provided by the Company, nor do they participate in any performance-
related incentives.
The Chairman is provided with a chauffeur-driven car. This may be used for non-Company business, but the cost of the benefit 
of such usage shall be paid by the Chairman. 
Reimbursement of travel and subsistence costs (including payment of the associated tax cost) incurred by the director or his/her 
spouse whilst undertaking duties on behalf of the Company that may be assessed as a benefit for tax purposes. Directors’ and 
Officers’ insurance cover is also provided for all directors.
Maximum opportunity
See the aggregate limit under ‘Fees’ above.
Prior commitments 
For the duration of this Policy, the Company will honour any commitments made in respect of executive director and non-executive 
director remuneration and benefits before the date on which either: (i) the Directors’ remuneration policy becomes effective; or (ii) an 
individual becomes a director, even where such commitments are not consistent with the policy set out in this report or prevailing at 
the time any such commitment is fulfilled. This includes (without limitation) all existing share awards as detailed on page 102 of the 
2013 Annual Report under the PSP, SMP, RSP, ExSOP and ExSOP
2012
 that remain outstanding, Peter Lynas’ second residence allowance 
as detailed on page 93 of the 2013 Annual Report, and any commitments entered into (such as grants of share awards) consistent with 
a previously approved Directors’ remuneration policy that was applicable at the relevant time.

BAE Systems
Annual Report 2017
Directors’ remuneration policy 
continued Approach to recruitment remuneration
The recruitment policy provides an appropriate framework within which to attract individuals of the required calibre to lead a company 
of BAE Systems’ size, scale and complexity. The Remuneration Committee determines the remuneration package for any appointment 
to an executive director position, either from within or outside BAE Systems. 
Operation
The Remuneration Committee will take into consideration all relevant factors, including overall total remuneration, the type of 
remuneration being offered and the jurisdiction from which the candidate was recruited, and will operate in order to ensure that 
arrangements are in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders without paying more than is necessary to secure the 
individual of the required calibre.
The fees and benefits applicable to the appointment of any new non-executive directors will be in accordance with the policy table 
on page 126.
Opportunity
The Committee seeks to align the remuneration package offered with the policy set out in the executive directors’ policy table above 
recognising that participation under the policy above varies by geography. 
– For UK and other non-US executive director appointments, participation in annual incentive plans will not exceed 225% of annual 
salary and long-term awards under this Policy will not exceed 550% of annual salary. 
– For US executive director appointments, participation in annual incentive plans will not exceed 225% of annual salary and long-term 
awards under this Policy will not exceed 500% of annual salary.
The Committee may make awards on hiring an external candidate to ‘buy-out’ existing equity or, in exceptional circumstances, other 
elements of remuneration forfeited on leaving the previous employer. In doing so, the Committee will take account of relevant factors 
including any performance conditions attached to these awards, the form in which they were granted (e.g. cash or shares) and the 
time over which they would have vested. Buy-out awards would be capped to be no higher, on recruitment, than the fair value of 
those forfeited. Full details will be disclosed in the next Annual remuneration report following recruitment which will include details 
of the need to grant a buy-out award.
Fixed elements (base salary, retirement and other benefits)
The salary level will be set in accordance with the principles for setting base salary described in the executive directors’ policy 
table above.
The executive director shall be eligible to participate in applicable BAE Systems’ employee benefit plans, including coverage under 
applicable executive and employee pension and benefit programmes in accordance with the terms and conditions of such plans, as 
may be amended by the Company in its sole discretion from time to time.
In the case of promotion of an existing Group employee to an executive directorship on the Board, commitments made before such 
promotion will continue to be honoured whether or not they are consistent with the remainder of this Policy.
Annual Incentive Plan
The appointed executive director will be eligible to earn a discretionary annual bonus in accordance with the annual incentive 
framework as described in the executive directors’ policy table above.
The level of opportunity will be consistent with the policy disclosed in the executive directors’ policy table in this report and subject 
to the maximums referred to therein and under ‘Opportunity’ above.
Long-Term Incentive Plan
The executive director will be eligible for equity awards in such amounts as the Committee may determine in its sole discretion, 
subject to this Policy and the rules of the Long-Term Incentive Plan.
The level of opportunity will be consistent with the policy set out in the executive directors’ policy table above and subject to the 
maximums referred to therein and under ‘Opportunity’ above.
Other
For internal and external appointments, the Committee may agree that the Company will meet certain relocation expenses in 
accordance with the provisions described under the Benefits section of the policy table on page 122.

90 days’ notice of non-renewal.
Notice period
The Committee’s policy is that the service contracts of executive directors will not exceed 12 months. In exceptional circumstances, in 
relation to newly recruiting an executive director operating in a US environment, the notice period may be extended to a maximum of 
24 months and structured such that it reduces to no more than 12 months by no later than the end of the first complete year of service.
Change of control
No executive director has provisions in his service contract that relate to a change of control of the Company.
Chairman
The Chairman’s appointment is documented in a letter of appointment and he is required to devote no fewer than two days a week 
to his duties as Chairman. His appointment as Chairman (which commenced on 1 February 2014) will automatically terminate if he 
ceases to be a director of the Company. The Chairman’s appointment was reviewed by the Nominations Committee prior to the end 
of his initial three-year term and has been extended until February 2020, unless it is terminated earlier in accordance with the Company’s 
Articles of Association or by the Company or the Chairman giving not less than six months’ notice.

The non-executive directors are normally appointed for an initial three-year term that, subject to review, may be extended subsequently 
for further such terms. Any third term of three years is subject to rigorous review, taking into account the need progressively to refresh 
the Board. Non-executive directors do not have periods of notice.
In accordance with the UK Corporate Governance Code, all directors are subject to annual election or re-election at the Company’s AGM.
Policy on payment for loss of office 
Operation
The policy on payment for loss of office provides a clear set of principles that govern the payments that will be made for loss of office, 
and take account of the need to ensure a smooth transition for leadership roles during times of change. The policy that will apply for 
a specific executive director’s payments for loss of office will be the policy that was in place at the point when the payments for loss 
of office were agreed for the executive director in question.
Any termination payment made in connection with the departure of an executive director will be subject to approval by the 
Committee, having regard to the terms of the service contract or other legal obligations and the specific circumstances surrounding 
the termination, including whether the scenario aligns to an example under the approved leaver criteria, performance, service and 
health or other circumstances that may be relevant. 
In addition to payments described below, the Committee may pay such amounts as are necessary to settle or compromise any claim 
or by way of damages, where the Committee views it as in the best interests of the Company to do so. In the event of the termination 
of an executive director’s contract, it is the Committee’s policy to seek to limit any payment to not more than one year’s base salary.

Annual Report 2017
Directors’ remuneration policy 
continued Notice and pay in lieu of notice
Executive directors’ contracts allow for termination with contractual notice from either party or termination by way of payment of base 
salary in lieu of notice, at the Company’s discretion. Neither notice nor a payment in lieu of notice will be given in the event of gross 
misconduct. Any new executive director contracts since 2016 (including the Chief Operating Officer) concerning payment in lieu of 
notice provisions allow for the Committee to exercise discretion to apply phased payments and mitigation on that executive director 
securing alternative employment.
Jerry DeMuro’s contract of employment automatically renews for one-year periods from 31 December each year, unless one party 
gives at least 90 days’ notice of non-renewal. If the employment is (a) terminated by the Company (other than for cause as defined 
in the contract) or (b) he resigned for a ‘Good Reason’ (as defined in his contract), he is entitled to a termination payment equal to 
(i) one year’s base salary and (ii) a bonus payable at target level pro-rated for service for the relevant financial year. He will also be 
entitled to a continuation of medical benefits for 18 months (or a cash payment in lieu).
Other than notice payments, the Company has no obligation to make any termination payments when the Chairman’s appointment 
terminates. Non-executive directors do not have periods of notice and the Company has no obligation to make any termination 
payments when their appointment terminates, other than to pay fees in accordance with the appointment letters.
Retirement benefits
As governed by the rules of the relevant pension plan. No enhancement for leavers will be made.
Annual Incentive Plan
Where an executive director’s employment is terminated after the end of a performance year but before the payment is made, the 
executive director will remain eligible for an annual incentive award for that performance year subject to an assessment based on 
performance achieved over the period. No award will be made in the event of gross misconduct. 
The Committee may, as set out below, exercise its discretion to allow an annual incentive payment for the year of cessation as part 
of the termination package for executive directors. Where it does so, the exercise of the discretion and reason why the Committee 
considered such action appropriate will be disclosed. 
Where an executive director leaves during the relevant performance year by reason of death, ill-health, disability, retirement, a transfer 
of business or redundancy, the Committee may use its discretion to determine that an executive director will remain entitled to receive 
a bonus (subject to an assessment based on performance over the performance year and pro-rated for time) in respect of the financial 
year in which the individual ceased employment. One third of the bonus will be subject to compulsory deferral as set out previously, 
unless the Committee decides otherwise.
The Committee’s policy is not to award an annual incentive for any portion of the notice period not served.
The treatment set out above does not apply to the President and Chief Executive Officer of BAE Systems, Inc.
Long-Term Incentive Plans
The treatment of outstanding share awards in the event that an executive director leaves is governed by the relevant share plan rules.
Under the Long-Term Incentive Plan, where an executive director leaves the Group by reason of ill-health, injury, disability, retirement 
with the agreement of the Company, sale of a business or employing company, redundancy or leaving in such circumstances as the 
Committee determines (each an ‘approved leaver’), unvested awards and options generally continue and vest on the normal vesting 
date (or, in the case of Performance Shares held by US executive directors, the first normal vesting date or, if later, cessation), unless 
the Committee determines that the awards should vest on cessation. Any performance conditions will be applied at the time of vesting.
On vesting, the number of shares under award will, unless the Committee decides otherwise, be reduced pro-rata to reflect the 
period in which the executive director was in employment as a proportion of the relevant vesting period (or in the case of Performance 
Shares held by US executive directors or Performance Shares granted prior to the 2017 AGM, as a proportion of the initial three-year 
vesting period).
In the event of death, awards generally vest at the time of death subject to the satisfaction of any performance conditions at that time. 
Awards are then pro-rated as set out above.
Where an executive director’s employment is terminated for any other reason, his unvested awards and options will lapse. Options 
normally remain exercisable for six months after cessation (or vesting, if later) and 12 months after death. 
If the Committee exercises its discretion to treat a director as an approved leaver as permissible under the leaver provisions of the share 
plan rules, the exercise of the discretion and reason why the Committee considered such action appropriate will be disclosed.
Where an executive director’s employment is terminated or an executive director is under notice of termination for any reason at the 
date of award of any Long-Term Incentive awards, no Long-Term Incentive awards will be made.
Consideration of employment conditions elsewhere in the Company
The Committee does not consult directly with employees as part of the process for reviewing executive pay. When considering 
salary increases for the executive directors, the Committee considers the general level of salary increase across the Group and 
in the external market.
Stakeholder considerations
The Committee conducts an annual programme of consultation with major shareholders in order to seek their input to the 
development of remuneration policy or plans.

instrument of transfer of shares unless the 
instrument of transfer is in respect of only

Restrictions on voting deadlines
The notice of any general meeting shall specify

Appointment and replacement of directors
Subject to certain nationality requirements 
mentioned below, the Company may by 
ordinary resolution appoint any person to 
be a director.
The directors also have the power to make 
appointments to the Board at any time. 
Any individual so appointed will hold office 
until the next AGM and shall then be eligible 
for re-election.
The majority of directors holding office must 
be British. Otherwise, the directors who are 
not British shall vacate office in such order 
that those who have been in office for the 
shortest period since their appointment shall 
vacate their office first, unless all of the 
directors otherwise agree among themselves. 
Any director who holds the office of either 
Chairman (in an executive capacity) or Chief 
Executive shall also be British.
The Company must have not less than six 
directors holding office at all times. If the 
number is reduced to below six, then such 
number of persons shall be appointed as 
directors as soon as is reasonably practicable 
to reinstate the number of directors to six. 
The Company may by ordinary resolution 
from time to time vary the minimum number 
of directors.
At each AGM of the Company, any director 
who was elected or last re-elected at or 
before the AGM held in the third calendar 
year before the then current calendar year 
must retire by rotation and such further 
directors must retire by rotation so that in 
total one-third of the directors retire by 
rotation each year. A retiring director is 
eligible for re-election. It is the Board’s 
intention that all directors will stand for 
election or re-election in 2018 in compliance 
with the UK Corporate Governance Code.
Amendment of the Company’s Articles 
of Association
The Company’s Articles of Association may 
only be amended by a special resolution at a 
general meeting of shareholders. Where class 
rights are varied, such amendments must be 
approved by the members of each class of 
shares separately.
In addition, certain provisions of the Articles 
of Association cannot be amended without 
the consent of the Special Shareholder. These 
provisions include the requirement that no 
foreign person, or foreign persons acting in 
concert, can have more than a 15% voting 
interest in the Company, the requirement that 
the majority of the directors are British, and 
the requirement that the Chief Executive and 
any executive Chairman are British.
Powers of the directors
The directors are responsible for the 
management of the business of the Company 
and may exercise all powers of the Company 
subject to applicable legislation and 
regulation, and the Articles of Association.
At the 2017 AGM, the directors were given 
the power to buy back a maximum number 
of 317,752,630 ordinary shares at a minimum 
price of 2.5p each. The maximum price 
was the higher of (i) an amount equal to 
105% of the average of the middle market 
quotations of the Company’s ordinary shares 
as derived from the London Stock Exchange 
Daily Official List for the five business days 
immediately preceding the day on which 
such ordinary shares are contracted to be 
purchased, and (ii) the higher of the price 
of the last independent trade and the 
highest current independent bid on the 
London Stock Exchange as stipulated by 
Regulatory Technical Standards adopted 
by the European Commission pursuant to 
article 5(6) of the Market Abuse Regulation. 
This power will expire at the earlier of the 
conclusion of the 2018 AGM or 30 June 2018. 
A special resolution will be proposed at the 
2018 AGM to renew the Company’s authority 
to acquire its own shares.
At the 2017 AGM, the directors were given 
the power to issue new shares up to a nominal 
amount of £26,476,737. This power will expire 
on the earlier of the conclusion of the 2018 
AGM or 30 June 2018. Accordingly, a 
resolution will be proposed at the 2018 AGM 
to renew the Company’s authority to issue 
further new shares. At the 2017 AGM, the 
directors were also given the power to issue 
new issue shares up to a further nominal 
amount of £26,476,737 in connection with an 
offer by way of a rights issue. This authority too 
will expire on the earlier of the conclusion of 
the 2018 AGM or 30 June 2018, however, no 
resolution to renew this additional authority 
will be proposed at the 2018 AGM.

Statutory and other information 
continued Conflicts of interest
As permitted under the Companies Act 2006, 
the Company’s Articles of Association contain 
provisions which enable the Board to authorise 
conflicts or potential conflicts that individual 
directors may have.
To avoid potential conflicts of interest the 
Board requires the Nominations Committee 
to check that any individuals it nominates for 
appointment to the Board are free of potential 
conflicts. In addition, the Board’s procedures 
and the induction programme for new 
directors emphasise a director’s personal 
responsibility for complying with the duties 
relating to conflicts of interest. The procedure 
adopted by the Board for the authorisation 
of conflicts reminds directors of the need to 
consider their duties as directors and not grant 
an authorisation unless they believe, in good 
faith, that this would be likely to promote the 
success of the Company. As required by law, 
the potentially conflicted director cannot vote 
on an authorisation resolution or be counted 
in the quorum. Any authorisation granted may 
be terminated at any time and the director is 
informed of the obligation to inform the 
Company without delay should there be any 
material change in the nature of the conflict 
or potential conflict so authorised.
Directors’ indemnities
The Company has entered into deeds of 
indemnity with all its current directors and 
those persons who were directors for any 
part of 2017 which are qualifying indemnity 
provisions for the purpose of the Companies 
Act 2006.
The directors of BAE Systems Pension Funds 
Trustees Limited, BAE Systems 2000 Pension 
Plan Trustees Limited, BAE Systems Executive 
Pension Scheme Trustees Limited and Alvis 
Pension Scheme Trustees Limited benefit from 
indemnities in the governing documentation 
of the BAE Systems Pension Scheme, the 
BAE Systems 2000 Pension Plan, the 
BAE Systems Executive Pension Scheme and 
the Alvis Pension Scheme, respectively, which 
are qualifying indemnity provisions for the 
purpose of the Companies Act 2006.
All such indemnity provisions are in force as 
at the date of this Directors’ report.

be contrary to the defence, national security 
or national interest of the UK, then the 
change of control shall not proceed until

The directors are responsible for preparing 
the Annual Report, and the Group and parent 
company financial statements in accordance 
with applicable law and regulations.
Company law requires the directors to

of the state of affairs of the Group and parent 
company, and of their profit or loss for that 
period. In preparing each of the Group and 
parent company financial statements, the 
directors are required to:
– select suitable accounting policies and 
then apply them consistently;

reasonable, relevant, reliable and prudent;
– for the Group financial statements, 
state whether they have been prepared 
in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by 
the EU;
– for the parent company financial

Annual Report 2017
Financial statements Governance Opinions and conclusions arising 
from our audit
1. Our opinion is unmodified
We have audited the financial statements of 
BAE Systems plc (the Company) for the year 
ended 31 December 2017 which comprise the 
Consolidated income statement, the Consolidated 
statement of comprehensive income, the 
Consolidated statement of changes in equity, 
the Consolidated balance sheet, the Consolidated 
cash flow statement, the Company Statement of 
comprehensive income, the Company Statement 
of changes in equity, the Company Balance sheet 
and the related notes, including the accounting 
policies, on pages 144 to 207. 
In our opinion: 
– the financial statements give a true and fair view 
of the state of the Group’s and of the parent 
company’s affairs as at 31 December 2017 and 
of the Group’s profit for the year then ended; 
– the Group financial statements have been 
properly prepared in accordance with International 
Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the 
European Union; 
– the parent company financial statements have 
been properly prepared in accordance with 
UK accounting standards, including FRS 101, 
Reduced Disclosure Framework; and 
– the financial statements have been prepared 
in accordance with the requirements of the 
Companies Act 2006 and, as regards the 
Group financial statements, Article 4 of the 
IAS Regulation. 
Basis for opinion 
We conducted our audit in accordance with 
International Standards on Auditing (UK) 
(ISAs (UK)) and applicable law. Our responsibilities 
are described below. We believe that the audit 
evidence we have obtained is a sufficient and 
appropriate basis for our opinion. Our audit 
opinion is consistent with our report to the 
Audit Committee. 
We were appointed as auditor by the directors 
during the period of the Company’s incorporation 
in 1981. The period of total uninterrupted 
engagement is for the 37 financial years ended 
31 December 2017. We have fulfilled our ethical 
responsibilities under, and we remain independent 
of the Group in accordance with, UK ethical 
requirements including the FRC Ethical Standard 
as applied to listed public interest entities. No 
non-audit services prohibited by that Standard 
were provided during 2017 by KPMG. 
2. Key audit matters: our assessment 
of risks of material misstatement
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our 
professional judgement, were of most significance 
in the audit of the Group financial statements 
and include the most significant assessed risks 
of material misstatement (whether or not due to 
fraud) identified by us, including those which had 
the greatest effect on: the overall audit strategy; the 
allocation of resources in the audit; and directing 
the efforts of the engagement team. We summarise 
below the key audit matters, in decreasing order 
of audit significance, in arriving at our audit opinion 
above, together with our key audit procedures to 
address those matters and, as required for public 
interest entities, our results from those procedures. 
These matters were addressed, and our results are 
based on procedures undertaken, in the context 
of, and solely for the purpose of, our audit of the 
financial statements as a whole, and in forming 
our opinion thereon, and consequently are 
incidental to that opinion, and we do not provide 
a separate opinion on these matters.
Group financial statements
2.1. Net retirement benefit obligations
Refer to page 84 (Audit Committee report) and pages 
174 to 183 (accounting policy and financial disclosures)
Group’s share of the net IAS 19 deficit: 
£3,920m (2016 £6,054m)
Risk versus 2016:  
The risk: Subjective valuation
The valuation of the defined benefit pension deficit 
depends on a number of judgemental assumptions 
and estimates, including the discount rates used to 
calculate the current value of the future payments 
the Group expects to pay pensioners, the rate of 
inflation that must be incorporated in the estimate 
of the future pension payments and the life 
expectancy of pension scheme members. 
There is a considerable amount of judgement 
required in setting the above assumptions and, 
given the size of the schemes, a small change in the 
assumptions and estimates may have a significant 
impact on the retirement benefit obligations.
Further assumptions are made in the determination 
of the Group’s share of assets and liabilities of the 
multi-employer schemes in which it participates 
and the corresponding amounts attributed to 
other participating employers.
Our response
Our audit procedures included:
Our actuarial expertise: We used our own 
actuarial specialists to challenge key assumptions 
and estimates used in the calculation of the pension 
deficit. The key assumptions and estimates we 
tested included the discount rate, inflation and life 
expectancy assumptions that were applied to the 
valuation. We also compared the IAS 19 valuation 
with the triennial funding valuations of the UK 
schemes notwithstanding that they were prepared 
on a different basis and as at different dates.
Benchmarking assumptions: We performed 
a comparison of key assumptions against our 
own benchmark ranges which are derived from 
externally-available data as well as comparing 
against those used by other companies reporting 
on the same period. 
Methodology assessment: We used our own 
actuarial specialists to assess the appropriateness 
and consistency of the methodology applied 
by management in setting the key assumptions. 
We challenged the reasons for any changes 
in methodology and considered the presence 
of indicators for bias. 
Multi-employer allocation: We challenged 
management in respect of their selection of the 
basis upon which to allocate a portion of the 
multi-employer retirement benefit obligations 
to other participating employers and, in respect of 
the largest participating employer (being MBDA), 
agreed the amount allocated to their records. 
Assessing transparency: We considered the 
adequacy of the Group’s disclosure in respect of 
retirement benefits, in particular the net retirement 
benefit obligation and the assumptions used, which 
are set out in note 21 to the financial statements. 
Results
We found the valuation of the net retirement 
benefit obligation to be acceptable (2016 result: 
acceptable).

BAE Systems
Annual Report 2017
Independent Auditor’s report
to the members of BAE Systems plc only 2.2. Recognition of revenues and profits 
on long-term contracts
Refer to page 84 (Audit Committee report) and pages 
148 to 150 (accounting policy and financial disclosures)
Revenues: £11,910m (2016 £11,659m)
Risk versus 2016:  
The risk: Subjective estimate
Long-term contracts include complex technical 
and commercial requirements and often specify 
performance milestones to be achieved throughout 
the contract period, which can last many years. 
At each balance sheet date, estimates and 
assumptions involving a high degree of judgement 
and estimation uncertainty are required in order to:
– assess the proportion of revenues to recognise 
in line with milestones achieved and progress 
made on contracts;
– forecast the outturn profit margin on each 
contract, incorporating appropriate allowances 
for technical and commercial risks related to 
performance milestones yet to be achieved, 
particularly in the case of fixed-price 
contracts; and
– appropriately identify, value and provide for 
loss-making contracts.
The directors have detailed procedures and 
processes, called Lifecycle Management (LCM), 
in place to manage the commercial, technical 
and financial aspects of long-term contracts. 
The LCM process includes the regular preparation 
of a Contract Status Report (CSR), which includes 
key accounting and forecast information for the 
relevant contract.
The contracts requiring the highest degree of 
judgement that occupied a significant proportion 
of the audit effort included:
– Typhoon aircraft (European, Saudi and Omani);
– Astute Class submarines;
– Queen Elizabeth Class aircraft carrier;
– US commercial shipbuilding contracts; and
– Saudi British Defence Co-operation Programme.
Our response
Our audit procedures included:
Control design, observation and operation: 
We tested the design and operating effectiveness 
of key controls within the LCM process that support 
contract-related balances, including:
– transactional controls that underpin the production 
of long-term contract-related balances, including 
cost information on contracts: We tested the 
operation of purchase-to-pay cycle and payroll 
controls;
– programme-level controls: We inspected 
results from periodic peer reviews performed 
by experienced employees independent to the 
contract to challenge assumptions made and 
judgements taken at pre-determined stages 
of the contract lifecycle; and
– higher-level controls: We observed monthly 
contract review meetings, quarterly business 
unit review meetings and Group-level 
review meetings. 
For significant contracts (including those listed in 
our audit risk description), determined on the basis 
of the current and future technical or commercial 
complexity, financial significance and any forecast 
to be in significant loss-making positions:
Personnel interviews: We obtained an understanding 
of the performance and status of the contract 
through discussion with contract project teams, 
Group and business unit directors, as well as through 
attendance at project teams’ contract review 
meetings. We applied our cumulative knowledge 
of the status of the contracts and challenged the 
appropriateness of the contract position at the 
reporting date, including any central overlays to 
positions reported by subsidiaries and whether 
or not there were any indications of management 
override of controls or management bias.
Benchmarking assumptions: We challenged the 
Group’s positions through the examination of 
externally-available evidence, such as customer 
correspondence, and, in the case of one significant 
programme, met the customer directly to further 
corroborate the status of contracts and 
recoverability of work-in-progress and receivables.
Our valuations expertise: In the case of one specific 
project, we used our own valuation specialist to 
assess the valuation performed on behalf of the 
Group by an external valuation expert.
Results
The results of our testing were satisfactory and we 
considered the amount of revenue and profit on 
long-term contracts recognised to be acceptable 
(2016 result: acceptable). 
2.3. Valuation of goodwill
Refer to page 85 (Audit Committee report) and pages 
158 to 160 (accounting policy and financial disclosures)
Goodwill: £9,996m (2016 £10,902m)
Risk versus 2016: 
The risk: Forecast-based valuation
The Group holds a significant amount of goodwill 
relating to UK and overseas (principally US) 
acquisitions during the past 20 years. The Group 
estimates recoverable amounts based on value in 
use which requires significant estimation and 
judgement in forecasting future cash flows and 
determining discount rates. 
The US Department of Defense fiscal year 2018 
budget and the current programme of work 
support the planning assumptions for the Group’s 
US businesses. However, future year budgets and 
the allocation of the budget between the Group 
and its competitors remains uncertain. This places 
continued importance on the US business to secure 
export contracts. Both of these factors contribute 
to the risk that the goodwill allocated to the 
Group’s US Cash-Generating Units (CGUs) may 
not be recoverable, although we consider this 
risk to have reduced from the prior year.
The Applied Intelligence CGU with an allocated 
goodwill balance of £0.2bn at the reporting date 
(2016 £0.6bn) operates in a highly competitive and 
fragmented market where significant investment is 
required for growth and where the future business 
pipeline is much shorter than in most other 
business units in the Group. As such, we consider 
the uncertainty in forecasting cash flows higher 
and the valuation of this CGU to have a higher risk 
due to these sector-related factors. An impairment 
charge of £384m was recognised in respect of this 
CGU in 2017 (2016 £nil).
The remaining goodwill of £1.9bn is primarily 
allocated to CGUs based in the UK. Whilst there 
remains an inherent risk in the forecasting of 
future cash flows for these businesses, many of 
them hold sizeable order backlogs, much of which 
is with government agencies, providing increased 
support to the forecasts. We consider the 
valuation risks around these CGUs to be lower 
than Applied Intelligence.

Annual Report 2017
Financial statements Governance Our response
Our audit procedures included:
Historical comparison: Assessing the reasonableness 
of the directors’ assumptions by reference to past 
performance.
Benchmarking assumptions: Assessing the 
reasonableness of the directors’ assumptions by 
reference to publicly-available information, such 
as future defence expenditure. We also compared 
the directors’ assumptions to externally-derived 
data (for example, bond yields and inflation 
statistics) and internally-derived data to challenge 
other key inputs, such as projected economic 
growth and gearing leverage. 
Comparing valuations: We compared the sum 
of the discounted cash flows to the Group’s 
market capitalisation to assess the reasonableness 
of those cash flows and challenged management’s 
explanation in reconciling the two.
Our sector experience: Our valuation specialists 
assisted in evaluating the reasonableness of 
assumptions and methodologies underlying the 
discount rates adopted by the directors, including 
the discount rate applied in the valuation of the 
Applied Intelligence CGU.
Sensitivity analysis: We have run scenario-specific 
models, including changes to the discount rate, 
forecast cash flows and break-even analyses 
to stress-test the valuations of CGUs’ recoverable 
amounts.
Assessing transparency: We considered the 
adequacy of the Group’s disclosure in respect 
of the sensitivities to changes in key assumptions 
and the risks inherent in the valuation of goodwill. 
Results
We found the Group’s assessment of the 
recoverable amount of goodwill to be acceptable 
(2016 result: acceptable).
2.4. Tax accruals
Refer to page 85 (Audit Committee report) and page 171 
(accounting policy and financial disclosures)
Tax accruals: £351m (2016 £365m)
Risk versus 2016:  
The risk: Dispute outcomes
Accruals for tax contingencies require the directors 
to make judgements and estimates in relation to 
tax risks. This is one of the key judgement areas 
that our audit is concentrated on due to the Group 
operating in a number of tax jurisdictions, the 
complexities of local and international tax legislation, 
and the number of years which some matters can 
take to resolve.
The tax matters are at various stages, from 
the first identification of risks to discussions 
with tax authorities and through to tax tribunal 
or court proceedings.
Our response
Our audit procedures included:
Our taxation expertise: Our tax specialists assisted 
in assessing the Group’s tax positions, its exposure 
to future cash outflows and the assumptions 
used by the directors to estimate the tax accruals. 
This included an inspection of the Group’s 
correspondence with the relevant tax authorities 
and the Group’s external tax advisers. 
Benchmarking assumptions: We used our 
knowledge and experience of the application of 
the international and local legislation by the relevant 
authorities and courts in order to challenge the 
positions taken by the directors. In support of 
these positions, we separately met with certain 
key external tax advisers of the Group. In respect 
of certain matters, we compared the position taken 
by the directors with outcomes of similar cases.
Assessing transparency: We have also considered 
the adequacy of the Group’s tax disclosures.
Results
The results of our testing were satisfactory and 
we found the resulting estimate of tax accruals 
to be acceptable (2016 result: acceptable).
2.5. Deferred tax assets
Refer to page 85 (Audit Committee report) and pages 
169 to 171 (accounting policy and financial disclosures)
Deferred tax assets: £724m (2016 £1,251m)
Risk versus 2016: 
The risk: Subjective estimate
The directors are required to estimate the valuation 
of deferred tax assets and to record those assets 
to the extent their recovery is probable. This requires 
a significant element of judgement.
The majority of the deferred tax asset balance 
is in relation to the Group’s retirement benefit 
obligations. As a result of the reduction in the 
valuation of the Group’s net share of the retirement 
benefit obligations, the Group’s related deferred 
tax asset has also reduced: compared with last year, 
the period required for the Group to recover the 
amount of deferred tax is less. For this reason, we 
have determined that the audit risk has reduced 
from the prior year.
Our response
Our audit procedures included:
Assessing forecasts: We assessed and challenged 
the directors’ judgement as to why it is deemed 
probable that the deferred tax assets recognised 
will be recovered, considering:
– the appropriateness and reliability of 
forecasts used by management to estimate 
the recovery period; 
– the timeframe of the pension deficit recovery 
plan; and
– the consistency of this judgement with other 
assumptions and estimates made by the directors, 
for example, those used to test impairment of 
assets, including goodwill.
Benchmarking assumptions: We considered the 
funding arrangements agreed with the Trustees 
of the UK pension schemes. We compared the 
views and estimates arrived at by the directors 
(as described above) with advice received by the 
Trustees in arriving at the funding arrangements 
on the covenant provided by the Group over the 
deficit recovery periods. 
Tests of detail: We analysed the calculations used 
to determine the estimated recovery period and 
tested the accuracy of these calculations.
Results
As a result of our work, we found the level of 
deferred tax assets recognised to be acceptable 
(2016 result: acceptable).

Annual Report 2017
Independent Auditor’s report 
continued 3. Our application of materiality and an overview of the scope of our audit 
The materiality for the Group financial statements as 
a whole was set at £55m (2016 £55m), determined 
with reference to a benchmark of Group profit 
before taxation from continuing operations, of 
which it represents 4.9% (2016 4.8%).
Materiality for the parent company financial 
statements as a whole was set at £32m (2016 £30m), 
as communicated by the Group audit team. This is 
lower than the materiality we would otherwise 
have determined with reference to a benchmark 
of company net assets and represents 0.8% 
(2016 0.8%) of the Company’s net assets.
We agreed to report to the Audit Committee any 
corrected or uncorrected identified misstatements 
exceeding £3m for income statement items, in 
addition to other identified misstatements that 
warranted reporting on qualitative grounds.
Of the Group’s 41 (2016 41) reporting components, 
we subjected 11 (2016 11) to full-scope audits for 
Group purposes and 14 (2016 14) to specified 
risk-focused procedures. The latter were in our 
opinion not individually financially significant 
enough to require an audit for Group reporting 
purposes, but did present specific individual risks 
that needed to be addressed.
The components within the scope of our work 
accounted for the following percentages of the 
Group’s results:
For the remaining components, we performed 
analysis at an aggregated level to confirm our 
preliminary assessment that there were no significant 
risks of material misstatements within these.
The Group audit team instructed component 
auditors as to the significant areas to be covered, 
including the relevant risks detailed above and the 
information to be reported back. The Group audit 
team approved the component materiality levels, 
which ranged from £2.7m to £32m (2016 £4m 
to £37m), having regard to the mix of size and risk 
profile across the components. The work on seven 
of the 25 (2016 seven of the 25) in-scope 
components was performed by component 
auditors and the remainder, including the audit 
of the parent company, by the Group audit team.
The Group audit team held a global audit conference 
in 2014, where all significant component audit teams 
came together in London to consider the audit risk 
and strategy. Similar planning days took place in 
2017 with the most significant component teams 
from the UK, US and Saudi Arabia. In addition, the 
Group audit team visited component teams in the 
UK, US, Saudi Arabia and Australia to assess the 
audit risk and strategy, discuss and moderate the 
results of controls testing and discuss preliminary 
findings of audit procedures. Video and telephone 
conference meetings were also held with these 
component auditors and any others in our audit 
scope that were not physically visited. At these visits 
and meetings, the findings reported to the Group 
audit team were discussed in more detail, and any 
further work required by the Group audit team 
was then performed by the component auditor.
4. We have nothing to report on going concern 
We are required to report to you if:
– we have anything material to add or draw 
attention to in relation to the directors’ statement 
in the financial statements on page 142 on the 
use of the going concern basis of accounting with 
no material uncertainties that may cast significant 
doubt over the Group and Company’s use of that 
basis for a period of at least 12 months from the 
date of approval of the financial statements; or 
– the related statement under the Listing Rules 
set out on page 81 is materially inconsistent 
with our audit knowledge. 
We have nothing to report in these respects. 
5. We have nothing to report on the other 
information in the Annual Report 
The directors are responsible for the other 
information presented in the Annual Report 
together with the financial statements. Our opinion 
on the financial statements does not cover the other 
information and, accordingly, we do not express an 
audit opinion or, except as explicitly stated below, 
any form of assurance conclusion thereon. 
Our responsibility is to read the other information 
and, in doing so, consider whether, based on our 
financial statements audit work, the information 
therein is materially misstated or inconsistent with 
the financial statements or our audit knowledge. 
Based solely on that work we have not identified 
material misstatements in the other information.

2.6. Amounts relating to Group affiliates
These comprise:
Investments in subsidiary undertakings and 
participating interests: £8,439m (2016 £8,399m)
Amounts owed by subsidiary undertakings and 
Group joint ventures: £2,576m (2016 £2,954m)
Amounts owed to subsidiary undertakings and 
Group joint ventures: £(8,183)m (2016 £(8,461)m)
The risk: Material amounts 
The carrying amount of the Company’s 
investments in subsidiaries held at cost less 
impairment and intercompany receivables 
represent 77% (2016 79%) of the Company’s 
total assets. The Company’s intercompany 
liabilities represent 80% (2016 79%) of the 
Company’s total liabilities.
We do not consider the valuation of these 
investments and recovery of intercompany 
receivables or completeness of intercompany 
liabilities to be at a high risk of significant 
misstatement, or to be subject to a significant 
level of judgement. However, due to their 
materiality in the context of the Company 
financial statements, this is considered to be 
the area that had the greatest effect on our 
overall parent company audit. 
Our response
Tests of detail: We compared the investments 
and receivables to the net assets of the relevant 
entities to identify whether these net assets, being 
an approximation of their minimum recoverable 
amounts, were in excess of the investment carrying 
amounts. We agreed that the intercompany 
liabilities set-off against subsidiary counterparties 
in the Group consolidation.
Our sector experience: We evaluated key 
assumptions in the impairment models for certain 
significant investments, in particular those for 
profit contribution and growth, against our own 
knowledge of the historic trading performance 
of the relevant entities.
Control observation: We tested the automated 
controls over the process for matching and 
elimination of intercompany balances in the 
Group consolidation. 
Results
We found the assessment of the amounts recorded 
to be acceptable.

to add or draw attention to in relation to: 
– the directors’ confirmation within the viability 
statement on page 81 that they have carried out 
a robust assessment of the principal risks facing 
the Group, including those that would threaten 
its business model, future performance, solvency 
and liquidity; 
– the principal risks disclosures describing these 
risks and explaining how they are being managed 
and mitigated; and 
– the directors’ explanation in the viability statement 
of how they have assessed the prospects of the 
Group, over what period they have done so and 
why they considered that period to be 
appropriate, and their statement as to whether 
they have a reasonable expectation that the 
Group will be able to continue in operation and 
meet its liabilities as they fall due over the period 
of their assessment, including any related 
disclosures, drawing attention to any necessary 
qualifications or assumptions. 
Under the Listing Rules, we are required to review 
the viability statement. We have nothing to report 
in this respect. 
Corporate governance disclosures 
We are required to report to you if: 
– we have identified material inconsistencies 
between the knowledge we acquired during 
our financial statements audit and the directors’ 
statement that they consider that the annual 
report and financial statements taken as a whole 
is fair, balanced and understandable, and provides 
the information necessary for shareholders to 
assess the Group’s position and performance, 
business model and strategy; or 
– the section of the Annual Report describing 
the work of the Audit Committee does not 
appropriately address matters communicated 
by us to the Audit Committee.
We are required to report to you if the part of the 
Director’s report section relating to the Company’s 
compliance does not properly disclose a departure 
from the 11 provisions of the UK Corporate 
Governance Code specified by the Listing Rules 
for our review. 
We have nothing to report in these respects. 
6. We have nothing to report on the other 
matters on which we are required to report 
by exception 
Under the Companies Act 2006, we are required 
to report to you if, in our opinion: 
– adequate accounting records have not been 
kept by the parent company, or returns adequate 
for our audit have not been received from 
branches not visited by us; or 
– the parent company financial statements and 
the part of the Directors’ remuneration report 
to be audited are not in agreement with the 
accounting records and returns; or 
– certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration 
specified by law are not made; or 
– we have not received all the information 
and explanations we require for our audit. 
We have nothing to report in these respects. 
7. Respective responsibilities 
Directors’ responsibilities 
As explained more fully in their statement set out 
on pages 134 and 135, the directors are responsible 
for: the preparation of the financial statements, 
including being satisfied that they give a true and 
fair view; such internal control as they determine is 
necessary to enable the preparation of financial 
statements that are free from material misstatement, 
whether due to fraud or error; assessing the Group 
and parent company’s ability to continue as a going 
concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to 
going concern; and using the going concern basis of 
accounting unless they either intend to liquidate the 
Group or the parent company or to cease operations, 
or have no realistic alternative but to do so. 
Auditor’s responsibilities 
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance 
about whether the financial statements as a whole 
are free from material misstatement, whether due 
to fraud or other irregularities (see below), or error, 
and to issue our opinion in an auditor’s report. 
Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, 
but does not guarantee that an audit conducted 
in accordance with ISAs (UK) will always detect a 
material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements 
can arise from fraud, other irregularities or error 
and are considered material if, individually or in 
aggregate, they could reasonably be expected 
to influence the economic decisions of users taken 
on the basis of the financial statements. 
A fuller description of our responsibilities is 
provided on the FRC’s website at www.frc.org.uk/
auditorsresponsibilities
Irregularities – ability to detect
Our audit aimed to detect non-compliance with 
relevant laws and regulations (irregularities) that 
could have a material effect on the financial 
statements. In planning and performing our audit, 
we considered the impact of laws and regulations 
in the specific areas of export control, defence 
contracting and anti-bribery and corruption 
legislation. We identified these areas through 
discussion with the directors and other management 
(as required by auditing standards), from our sector 
experience and from inspection of the Group’s legal 
correspondence. In addition, we had regard to laws 
and regulations in other areas, including financial 
reporting, and company and taxation legislation.
We considered the extent of compliance with those 
laws and regulations that directly affect the financial 
statements, being anti-bribery and corruption and 
as part of our procedures on the related financial 
statement items. For the remaining laws and 
regulations, we made enquiries of directors and 
other management (as required by auditing 
standards), and inspected legal correspondence.
We communicated identified laws and regulations 
throughout our team and remained alert to any 
indications of non-compliance throughout the 
audit. This included communication from the 
Group to component audit teams of relevant laws 
and regulations identified at Group level, with a 
request to report on any indications of potential 
existence of irregularities in these areas, or other 
areas directly identified by the component team.
As with any audit, there remained a higher 
risk of non-detection of irregularities, as these 
may involve collusion, forgery, intentional 
omissions, misrepresentations or the override 
of internal controls.
8. The purpose of our audit work and 
to whom we owe our responsibilities 
This report is made solely to the Company’s 
members, as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 
of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006. Our audit 
work has been undertaken so that we might state 
to the Company’s members those matters we are 
required to state to them in an auditor’s report and 
for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted 
by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to 
anyone other than the Company and the Company’s 
members, as a body, for our audit work, for this 
report, or for the opinions we have formed.

Financial 
statements Preparation
Basis of preparation
The consolidated financial statements of BAE Systems plc have been prepared on a going concern basis, as discussed in the Directors’ report 
on page 81, and in accordance with EU-endorsed International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and the Companies Act 2006 applicable 
to companies reporting under IFRS. 
The consolidated financial statements are presented in pounds sterling and, unless stated otherwise, rounded to the nearest million. They have 
been prepared under the historical cost convention, as modified by the revaluation of available-for-sale financial assets, and other relevant 
financial assets and financial liabilities (including derivative instruments). 
Transactions in foreign currencies are translated at the exchange rates ruling at the dates of the transactions. Monetary assets and liabilities 
denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the exchange rates ruling at the balance sheet date, with the resulting exchange differences 
recognised in the income statement.
Significant accounting policies
The significant accounting policies applied in the preparation of these consolidated financial statements are set out in the relevant notes. These 
policies have been applied consistently to all the years presented, unless otherwise stated. The directors believe that the consolidated financial 
statements reflect appropriate judgements and estimates, and provide a true and fair view of the Group’s financial performance and position.
Critical accounting policies
Certain of the Group’s significant accounting policies are considered by the directors to be critical because of the level of complexity, judgement 
or estimation involved in their application and their impact on the consolidated financial statements. The critical accounting policies are listed 
below and explained in more detail in the relevant notes to the Group accounts: 
Critical accounting policy Description Notes
Revenue and profit recognition The majority of long-term contracts are accounted for under IAS 1 1, Construction Contracts. 
Revenue on long-term contracts is recognised when performance milestones have been 
completed. Profit is recognised progressively as risks have been mitigated or retired.
The ultimate profitability of long-term contracts is based on estimates of revenue and 
costs, including allowances for technical and other risks, which are reliant on the 
knowledge and experience of the Group’s project managers, engineers, and finance and 
commercial professionals. Material changes in these estimates could affect the profitability 
of individual contracts. Revenue and cost estimates are reviewed and updated at least 
quarterly, and more frequently as determined by events or circumstances.
1
Carrying value of goodwill Goodwill is not amortised, but is tested annually for impairment and carried at cost less 
accumulated impairment losses. For the purposes of impairment testing, goodwill is 
allocated to Cash-Generating Units on a consistent basis.
The impairment review calculations require the use of estimates of the future profitability 
and cash-generating ability of the acquired businesses based on the Group’s five-year 
Integrated Business Plan and the pre-tax discount rate used in discounting these 
projected cash flows.
8
Deferred tax asset on retirement 
benefit obligations
The Group has recognised a deferred tax asset in respect of the deficits in its pension/
retirement schemes.
It is management’s judgement that the Group will generate sufficient taxable profits 
to recover the net deferred tax asset recognised. This judgement requires the use of 
estimates of future taxable profits based on the Group’s Integrated Business Plan.
14
Tax provisions Provision is made for known issues based on management’s interpretation of country-
specific legislation and the likely outcome of negotiations or litigation. The Group’s 
approach is to consider each uncertain tax position separately. Where management 
considers it is probable that there will be a future outflow of funds to a tax authority, 
a provision is recognised. The position is reviewed on an ongoing basis.
Provisions are measured using management’s best estimate of the most likely amount, 
being the single most likely amount in a range of possible outcomes. The Group 
discloses any significant uncertainties in relation to tax matters to the relevant tax 
authority. The resolution of tax positions taken by the Group can take a considerable 
period of time to conclude and, in some cases, it is difficult to predict the outcome.
16
Valuation of retirement benefit obligations Defined benefit pension scheme accounting valuations are prepared by independent 
actuaries. The liabilities of the pension schemes are valued based on a number of 
actuarial assumptions.
For each of the actuarial assumptions used there is a range of possible values and 
management estimates the point within that range that most appropriately reflects 
the Group’s circumstances. Small changes in these assumptions can have a significant 
impact on the size of the deficit.

Group  
accounts Preparation continued
Judgements made in applying accounting policies
In the course of preparing the financial statements, no judgements have been made in the process of applying the Group’s accounting policies, 
other than those involving estimates, that have had a significant effect on the amounts recognised in the financial statements.
Sources of estimation uncertainty
The application of the Group’s accounting policies requires the use of estimates. In the event that these estimates prove to be incorrect, there 
may be an adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year. The significant estimates in relation to the 
Group’s critical accounting policies are set out above. The only significant risk of a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and 
liabilities during 2018 relates to the determination of the discount rate and inflation assumptions underpinning the valuation of the liabilities 
of the Group’s defined benefit pension schemes. A description of the discount rate and inflation assumptions, together with sensitivity analysis, 
is set out in note 21 to the Group accounts.
Changes in accounting policies
IFRS 9, Financial Instruments
IFRS 9 is effective from 1 January 2018. The standard, replacing the requirements of IAS 39, Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement, 
introduces new requirements for recognition, classification and measurement, a new impairment model for financial assets based on expected 
credit losses, and simplified hedge accounting.
Any changes to the classification and measurement of financial instruments are applied retrospectively by adjusting opening retained earnings 
at 1 January 2018. There is no requirement to restate comparatives for prior periods. The Group has determined that there is no adjustment to 
retained earnings on transition to IFRS 9.
IFRS 15, Revenue from Contracts with Customers
IFRS 15 is effective from 1 January 2018. The standard requires the identification of performance obligations in contracts with customers and 
allocation of the total contractual value to each of the performance obligations identified. Revenue is recognised as each performance obligation 
is satisfied either at a point in time or over time. The standard will replace IAS 11, Construction Contracts, IAS 18, Revenue, and all other existing 
revenue accounting requirements within IFRS. The impact of the adoption of IFRS 15 on BAE Systems is set out in note 34.
IFRS 16, Leases
IFRS 16 is effective from 1 January 2019. The standard, which replaces IAS 17, Leases, was EU endorsed in October 2017. Whilst lessor accounting 
is similar to IAS 17, lessee accounting is significantly different. Under IFRS 16, the Group will recognise within the balance sheet a right-of-use 
asset and a lease liability for future lease payments in respect of all leases unless the underlying assets are of low value or the lease term is 12 
months or less. Within the income statement, rental expense on the impacted leases will be replaced with depreciation on the right-of-use asset 
and interest expense on the lease liability.
As set out in note 32, BAE Systems has operating lease commitments totalling £1.6bn at 31 December 2017 and, therefore, IFRS 16 will have a 
material impact on the Group. The implications of the standard are currently under review and the Group has not yet determined which transition 
option will be applied. As the impact of transition is dependent on the option chosen, the Group is unable to quantify the effect at this time.
Consolidation
The financial statements of the Group consolidate the results of the Company and its subsidiary entities, and include its share of its joint ventures’ 
results accounted for under the equity method. 
A subsidiary is an entity controlled by the Group. The Group controls a subsidiary when it is exposed, or has the rights, to variable returns from 
its involvement with the subsidiary and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the subsidiary. 
The results of subsidiaries are included in the income statement from the date of acquisition.
Intra-group balances and transactions, and any unrealised income and expenses arising from intra-group transactions, are eliminated in preparing 
the consolidated financial statements.
Joint ventures are accounted for under the equity method where the Consolidated income statement includes the Group’s share of their profits 
and losses, and the Consolidated balance sheet includes its share of their net assets within equity accounted investments. 
The assets and liabilities of overseas subsidiaries and equity accounted investments are translated at the exchange rates ruling at the balance sheet 
date. The income statements of such entities are translated at average rates of exchange during the year. All resulting exchange differences are 
recognised directly in a separate component of equity. 
Translation differences that arose before the transition date to IFRS (1 January 2004) are presented in equity, but not as a separate component. 
When a foreign operation is sold, the cumulative exchange differences recognised in equity since 1 January 2004 are recognised in the income 
statement as part of the profit or loss on sale.

Consolidated cash flow statement 
for the year ended 31 December 1. Segmental analysis
Revenue and profit recognition
Revenue represents income derived from the provision of goods and services by the Company and its subsidiary undertakings.
Long-term contracts
The majority of the Group’s long-term contract arrangements are accounted for under IAS 11, Construction Contracts. Revenue is recognised 
when the Group has obtained the right to consideration in exchange for its performance, which is when a separately identifiable phase 
(milestone) of a contract or development has been completed.
Profit is calculated by reference to reliable estimates of contract revenue and forecast costs after making suitable allowances for technical and 
other risks related to performance milestones yet to be achieved. No profit is recognised until the outcome of a contract can be reliably estimated. 
Profit is recognised progressively as risks have been mitigated or retired. 
When it is probable that total contract costs will exceed total contract revenue, the expected loss is recognised immediately as an expense.
Goods sold and services rendered
Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable, net of returns, rebates and other similar allowances. 
Revenue from the sale of goods not under long-term contract is recognised in the income statement when the significant risks and rewards of 
ownership have been transferred to the buyer, recovery of the consideration is probable, there is no continuing management involvement with 
the goods, and the amount of revenue and costs can be measured reliably. Profit is recognised at the time of sale.
Revenue from the provision of services not under long-term contract is recognised in the income statement in proportion to the stage of 
completion of the contract at the reporting date. The stage of completion is measured on the basis of direct expenses incurred as a percentage 
of total expenses to be incurred for material contracts and labour hours delivered as a percentage of total labour hours to be delivered for 
time contracts.
Revenue from the sale of software licences is recognised on delivery to the customer when the Group has no remaining obligations to perform 
and collection of the consideration is considered probable. In circumstances where the Group has future obligations to perform as part of a 
software licence and related services contract, revenue is recognised over the contract term.
Revenue and profits on intercompany trading are determined on an arm’s-length basis.
Research and development
The Group undertakes research and development activities either on its own behalf or on behalf of customers. 
Where the research and development activity is performed on behalf of customers, the revenue arising is recognised in the income statement 
in accordance with the Group’s revenue recognition policy on long-term contracts.
Reporting segments
During the year ended 31 December 2017, the Group had the following six reporting segments: 
–  Electronic Systems comprises the US and UK-based electronics activities, including electronic warfare systems, electro-optical sensors, military 
and commercial digital engine and flight controls, next-generation military communications systems and data links, persistent surveillance 
capabilities, and hybrid electric drive systems; 
–  Cyber & Intelligence comprises the US-based Intelligence & Security business and UK-headquartered Applied Intelligence business, and covers 
the Group’s cyber security, secure government, and commercial and financial security activities;
–  Platforms & Services (US), with operations in the US, UK and Sweden, manufactures combat vehicles, weapons and munitions, and delivers 
services and sustainment activities, including ship repair and the management of government-owned munitions facilities;
– Platforms & Services (UK) comprises the Group’s UK-based air, maritime, land and shared services activities;
–  Platforms & Services (International) comprises the Group’s businesses in Saudi Arabia, Australia and Oman, together with its 37.5% interest 
in the pan-European MBDA joint venture; and
– HQ comprises the Group’s head office activities, together with a 49% interest in Air Astana. 
Effective 1 January 2018, the Group revised its reporting segments to reflect the organisational changes described on page 17. The Group continues 
to have six reporting segments and there were no changes to the Electronic Systems, Cyber & Intelligence and Platforms & Services (US) reporting 
segments. The Platforms & Services (UK) and Platforms & Services (International) management structures have been removed with the organisation 
streamlined, and Air and Maritime reporting segments created.
Air comprises the Group’s UK-based air activities for European and International markets and UK-based US Programmes, and its businesses in 
Saudi Arabia and Australia, together with its 37.5% interest in the pan-European MBDA joint venture. Maritime comprises the Group’s UK-based 
maritime and land activities. The HQ reporting segment includes the Group’s UK-based head office and shared services activities, as well as a 
49% interest in Air Astana.
These reporting segments align with the Group’s strategic direction, determined with reference to the products and services they provide, 
and the markets in which they operate.
The Board (the chief operating decision maker as defined by IFRS 8, Operating Segments) monitors the results of these reporting segments 
to assess performance and make decisions about the allocation of resources. Segmental performance is evaluated based on Key Performance 
Indicators – sales (see page 149) and underlying EBITA (see page 150). Finance costs and taxation expense are managed on a Group basis.

Key Performance Indicator – Underlying EBITA
Definition Operating profit excluding amortisation and impairment of intangible assets, finance costs and taxation expense of equity accounted 
investments (EBITA), and non-recurring items.
Purpose Provides a measure of operating profitability that is comparable over time.
Amortisation and impairment of intangible assets are excluded because they are not related to the in-year operational performance of the 
business, being driven by the timing and amount of investment in acquired businesses and software.
Finance costs and taxation expense of equity accounted investments are excluded for consistency with pre-interest, pre-tax business performance.
Non-recurring items are not relevant to an understanding of the Group’s underlying performance and include:
2017
The loss of £13m represents the loss on disposal of the BAE Systems San Francisco Ship Repair business.
2016
The loss of £12m represented an impairment against the carrying value of the BAE Systems San Francisco Ship Repair business.

6. Taxation expense
Income tax expense comprises current and deferred tax. Current and deferred tax is recognised in profit or loss except to the extent that it relates 
to a business combination or items recognised directly in equity or other comprehensive income.
Current tax
Current tax is the expected tax payable or receivable on the taxable profit or loss for the year, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted 
at the reporting date, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years.
Deferred tax
Deferred tax is recognised in respect of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting 
purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes. Deferred tax is not recognised for temporary differences:
–  on the initial recognition of assets or liabilities in a transaction that is not a business combination and that affects neither accounting nor 
taxable profit or loss;
–  related to investments in subsidiaries and equity accounted investments to the extent that it is probable that they will not reverse in the 
foreseeable future; and
–  arising on the initial recognition of goodwill.
Deferred tax is measured at the tax rates that are expected to be applied to temporary differences when they reverse, based on the laws that 
have been enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting date.

this change, the rate applying to US deferred tax assets and liabilities at 31 December 2017 has been reduced from 40% to 27%, creating a rate adjustment in 2017, which 
is partly reflected in the Consolidated income statement and partly in the Consolidated statement of comprehensive income.

Annual Report 2017 7. Earnings per share 
Key Performance Indicator – Underlying earnings per share
Definition Basic earnings per share excluding amortisation and impairment of intangible assets, non-cash finance movements on pensions 
and financial derivatives, non-recurring items and, in 2017, the impact of US tax reform enacted in December 2017.
Purpose Provides a measure of underlying performance that is comparable over time.
Amortisation and impairment of intangible assets are excluded because they are not related to the in-year operational performance of the 
business, being driven by the timing and quantum of investment in acquired businesses and software.
Non-cash finance movements on pensions are excluded because they are driven by external factors, such as corporate bond yields and inflation.
Non-cash finance movements on financial derivatives are excluded because they are driven by external factors, such as foreign exchange rates 
and interest rates.
Non-recurring items are not relevant to an understanding of the Group’s underlying performance.
The impact of US tax reform enacted in December 2017 has been excluded because it does not reflect the Group’s in-year underlying tax rate.

8. Intangible assets
Intangible assets are carried at cost or valuation, less accumulated amortisation and impairment losses.
Cost or valuation
Goodwill
Under the acquisition method for business combinations, goodwill is the acquisition-date fair value of the consideration transferred, less the net 
of the acquisition-date fair values of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed. Goodwill on acquisitions of subsidiaries is included 
in intangible assets. Goodwill on acquisitions of joint ventures and associates is included in the carrying value of equity accounted investments. 
Gains and losses on the disposal of an entity include the carrying amount of goodwill relating to the entity sold.
Software
Software includes:
– Computer software licences acquired for use within the Group are capitalised as an intangible asset on the basis of the costs incurred to 
acquire and bring to use the specific software; and
– Software development costs that are directly associated with the production of identifiable and unique software products controlled by the 
Group, and that will probably generate economic benefits exceeding costs beyond one year, are recognised as intangible assets. Group-funded 
expenditure associated with enhancing or maintaining computer software programs for sale is recognised as an expense as incurred.
Development costs
Development costs funded by the Group on activities applied to a plan or design for the production of new or substantially improved products 
are capitalised as an internally generated intangible asset if certain conditions are met. The costs capitalised include materials, direct labour and 
related overheads. 
Programme and customer-related
Intangible assets recognised by the Group include those relating to ongoing programmes within businesses acquired, mainly in respect 
of customer relationships and order backlog.
Other
Other intangible assets includes patents, trademarks and licences.
Amortisation
Goodwill is not amortised. Amortisation on intangible assets, excluding goodwill, is charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis 
over their estimated useful lives. 
For programme-related intangibles, amortisation is set on a programme-by-programme basis over the life of the individual programme. 
Amortisation for customer-related intangibles is also set on an individual basis.
The estimated useful lives are as follows:
Software 2 to 5 years
Development costs up to 10 years
Programme and customer-related up to 15 years
Other up to 20 years
The Group has no indefinite-life intangible assets other than goodwill.
Impairment of intangible assets, property, plant and equipment, investment property and equity accounted investments
The carrying amounts of the Group’s intangible assets (excluding goodwill), property, plant and equipment, investment property and equity 
accounted investments are reviewed at each balance sheet date to determine whether there is any indication of impairment as required by IAS 36, 
Impairment of Assets. If any such indication exists, the asset’s recoverable amount is estimated. For goodwill and intangible assets that are not yet 
available for use, impairment testing is performed annually.
An impairment loss is recognised whenever the carrying amount of an asset or its Cash-Generating Unit exceeds its recoverable amount. 
The recoverable amount is the greater of fair value less costs to sell and value in use. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are 
discounted to their present value using an appropriate pre-tax discount rate. For an asset that does not generate largely independent cash flows, 
the recoverable amount is determined for the Cash-Generating Unit to which the asset belongs. 
Impairment losses are recognised in the income statement.
An impairment loss in respect of goodwill is not reversed. An impairment loss in respect of other intangible assets, property, plant and equipment, 
investment property and equity accounted investments is reversed if the subsequent increase in recoverable amount can be related objectively to 
an event occurring after the impairment loss was recognised or if there has been a change in the estimate used to determine the recoverable 
amount. An impairment loss is reversed only to the extent that the asset’s carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have 
been determined, net of depreciation or amortisation, if no impairment loss had been recognised.

4. Amortisation of £85m includes £82m charged to the income statement as an amortisation expense and £3m recoverable on customer contracts.
Impairment testing
The recoverable amount of the Group’s goodwill is based on value in use estimated using risk-adjusted future cash flow projections from the 
five-year Integrated Business Plan (IBP) and a terminal value based on the projections for the final year of that plan, with growth rate assumptions 
in the range 0% to 2% applied. The IBP process includes the use of historical experience, available government spending data and the Group’s 
order backlog. Pre-tax discount rates, derived from the Group’s post-tax weighted average cost of capital of 6.60% (2016 7.01%) (adjusted for 
risks specific to the market in which the Cash-Generating Unit (CGU) operates), have been used in discounting these projected risk-adjusted 
cash flows.

Other CGUs
The remaining goodwill balance of £2.1bn (2016 £2.5bn) is allocated across multiple CGUs, including £0.2bn (2016 £0.6bn) in the Applied 
Intelligence CGU, with no individual CGU exceeding 10% of the Group’s total goodwill balance. The majority of the projected cash flows within 
these CGUs are underpinned by expected levels of primarily UK government spending on defence, aerospace and security, and the Group’s ability 
to capture a broadly consistent market share. In the case of Applied Intelligence, the future cash flow projections are based on the expectation of 
growth in cyber and intelligence, in the UK and overseas government markets, together with increasing demand for products and services in 
commercial markets.
Impairment
In 2017, the impairment charge of £384m reflects lower growth assumptions in the Applied Intelligence CGU. The recoverable amount of the 
Applied Intelligence CGU is based on value in use calculated using a pre-tax discount rate of 16% (2016 11%).

Annual Report 2017 9. Property, plant and equipment
Cost
Items of property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses. The cost of self-constructed 
assets includes the cost of materials, direct labour and an appropriate proportion of production overheads. The cost of demonstration assets 
is written off as incurred. The reimbursement of the cost of an item of property, plant and equipment by a customer is presented as deferred 
income and recognised in the income statement on a basis consistent with the depreciation of the asset over its estimated useful life. 
Assets held for leasing out under operating leases are included in property, plant and equipment at cost less accumulated depreciation and 
impairment losses.
Depreciation
Depreciation is provided, normally on a straight-line basis, to write off the cost of items of property, plant and equipment over their estimated 
useful lives to any estimated residual value, using the following rates:
Buildings up to 50 years, or the lease term if shorter
Plant and machinery:
Computing equipment and motor vehicles 4 to 5 years
Other equipment 10 to 20 years, or the project life if shorter
For certain items of plant and equipment in the Group’s US businesses, depreciation is normally provided on a basis consistent with cost 
reimbursement profiles under US government contracts. Typically, this provides for a faster rate of depreciation than would otherwise arise 
on a straight-line basis.
No depreciation is provided on freehold land and assets in the course of construction.
The assets’ residual values, useful lives and depreciation methods are reviewed, and adjusted if appropriate, at each balance sheet date. 
Impairment
The carrying amounts of the Group’s property, plant and equipment are reviewed at each balance sheet date to determine whether there 
is any indication of impairment in accordance with the policy shown in note 8.

A joint venture is a joint arrangement whereby the parties that have joint control have rights to the net assets of the arrangement. 
Carrying value
The carrying value of an equity accounted investment comprises the Group’s share of net assets and purchased goodwill, and is assessed for 
impairment as a single asset. The carrying amounts of the Group’s equity accounted investments are reviewed at each balance sheet date to

Annual Report 2017 12. Trade and other receivables
Trade receivables are stated at their cost less provision for bad debts. A provision for bad debt is established when there is objective evidence 
that the Group will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the original terms of the receivables. Significant financial difficulties of 
the debtor, probability that the debtor will enter bankruptcy or financial reorganisation, and default or delinquency in payments are considered 
indicators that the trade receivable is impaired. Receivables with a short-term duration are not discounted.
A loss on provision for bad debt is reversed if the subsequent increase in recoverable amount can be related objectively to an event occurring 
after the impairment loss was recognised.
Amounts due from customers for contract work includes long-term contract balances and amounts due from contract customers, less attributable 
progress payments.
Long-term contract balances are stated at cost less provision for any anticipated losses. Provisions for losses on contracts are recorded when it 
becomes probable that total estimated contract costs will exceed total contract revenues. Such provisions are recorded as write downs of long-term 
contract balances for that portion of the work which has already been completed, and the remainder is included as amounts due to long-term 
contract customers within trade and other payables. Losses are determined on the basis of estimated results on completion of contracts and are 
updated regularly.
Progress payments are amounts received from customers in accordance with the terms of contracts which specify payments in advance of 
delivery and are credited, as progress payments, against any expenditure incurred for the particular contract. Any unexpended balance in 
respect of progress payments is held in trade and other payables as customer stage payments or, if the amounts are subject to advance payment 
guarantees unrelated to Group performance, as cash received on customers’ account.
Amounts due from contract customers represent unbilled income and are stated at cost, plus attributable profit.
US deferred compensation plan assets are measured at fair value in accordance with IAS 19, Employee Benefits.

Derivative financial instruments and hedging activities
The international nature of the Group’s business means it is exposed to volatility in currency exchange rates. In order to protect itself against 
currency fluctuations, the Group’s policy is to hedge all material firm transactional exposures. 
The Group uses interest rate derivative instruments to manage the Group’s exposure to interest rate fluctuations on its borrowings and deposits 
by varying the proportion of fixed rate debt relative to floating rate debt over the forward time horizon. 
The Group uses foreign exchange derivative instruments to manage the Group’s exposure to currency fluctuations on its borrowings and deposits 
with the Group’s subsidiaries and equity accounted investments.
In accordance with its treasury policy, the Group does not hold derivative financial instruments for trading purposes.
The Group aims to achieve hedge accounting treatment for all derivatives that hedge material foreign currency exposures and those interest rate 
exposures where hedge accounting can be achieved. 
Derivative financial instruments are recognised initially at fair value. Subsequent to initial recognition, such instruments are stated at fair value 
at the balance sheet date. The fair values are estimated by discounting expected future cash flows.
Fair value through profit or loss
Gains and losses on derivative financial instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting are recognised in the income statement for 
the period. 
Cash flow hedges
Where a derivative financial instrument is designated as a hedge of cash flows relating to a highly probable forecast transaction (income or 
expense), the effective portion of any change in the fair value of the instrument is recognised in other comprehensive income and presented 
in the hedging reserve in equity. Amounts recognised in equity are reclassified from reserves into the cost of the underlying transaction and 
recognised in the income statement when the underlying transaction affects profit or loss. The ineffective portion of any change in the fair 
value of the instrument is recognised in the income statement immediately. 
Fair value hedges
Where a derivative financial instrument is designated as a fair value hedge, changes in the fair value of the underlying asset or liability attributable 
to the hedged risk, and gains and losses on the derivative instrument, are recognised in the income statement for the period.

Cash flow hedges
The hedged, highly probable forecast transactions denominated in foreign currency are predominantly expected to occur at various stages 
during the next 12 months. The majority of those extending beyond 12 months are expected to have been transacted within five years of 
the balance sheet date.
Amounts credited to the hedging reserve in respect of cash flow hedges were £61m (2016 £87m), including £24m (2016 £74m) 
on reclassification to profit and loss and £37m (2016 £13m credit) on contracts held at 31 December 2017. 
Fair value hedges
The loss arising in the income statement on fair value hedging instruments was £4m (2016 £3m). The gain arising in the income statement 
on the fair value of the underlying hedged items was £4m (2016 £1m).
Debt-related derivative financial instruments
The debt-related derivative financial instruments represent the fair value of cross-currency, interest rate and foreign exchange derivatives 
relating to the US$500m 2.85% bond, repayable 2020, the US$800m 3.8% bond, repayable 2024, the US$750m 3.85% bond, repayable 
2025, the US$500m 7.5% bond, repayable 2027, and the US$550m 4.75% bond, repayable 2044 (see note 19). These derivatives have 
been entered into specifically to manage the Group’s exposure to foreign exchange or interest rate risk.

Annual Report 2017 14. Deferred tax
A deferred tax asset is recognised for unused tax losses, tax credits and deductible temporary differences to the extent that it is probable that 
future taxable profits will be available against which they can be utilised. Deferred tax assets are reviewed at each reporting date and reduced 
to the extent that it is no longer probable that the related tax benefit will be realised.
The most significant recognised deferred tax assets relate to the deficits on the Group’s pension/retirement schemes (see below). This is because 
retirement benefit costs are deducted in determining accounting profit as service is provided by employees, but deducted in determining taxable 
profit either when contributions are paid to the pension/retirement schemes or when retirement benefits are paid. In reviewing the probability 
that taxable profits will be available in the future against which such contributions/payments can be deducted, account has been taken of the 
new deficit recovery plans agreed with the trustees of the relevant schemes in November 2017 under which the deficits are expected to be 
cleared between 2021 and 2026 (see note 21).
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset if there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax liabilities and assets, and they relate to 
income taxes levied by the same tax authority on the same taxable entity, or on different taxable entities, but they intend to settle current tax 
liabilities and assets on a net basis or their tax assets and liabilities will be realised simultaneously.

The Group has not recognised any deferred tax liability on temporary differences totalling £237m (2016 £274m) relating to potentially taxable 
unremitted earnings of overseas subsidiaries and equity accounted investments because any withholding tax due on the remittance of those 
earnings is expected to be insignificant.

Future changes in tax rates
The US federal tax rate has been reduced from 35% to 21% with effect from 1 January 2018, while the estimated state tax rate has increased 
from 5% to 6%. This will reduce future US current tax charges accordingly. Recognised US deferred tax balances as at 31 December 2017 have 
been calculated at a combined federal and state tax rate of 27% (2016 40%).
The UK current tax rate reduced from 20% to 19% with effect from 1 April 2017 and will reduce to 17% with effect from 1 April 2020. This will 
reduce future UK current tax charges accordingly. Both recognised and unrecognised UK deferred tax balances as at 31 December 2017 have 
been calculated at a blended rate of 17.5% (2016 18%).

Current tax for the current and prior periods is recognised as a liability to the extent that it has not yet been settled, and as an asset to the extent 
that the amounts already paid exceed the amount due or the benefit of a tax loss can be carried back to recover current tax of a prior period. 
Current tax assets and liabilities are measured at the amount expected to be paid to or recovered from taxation authorities, using the rates that 
have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.

21. Retirement benefits
Pension schemes
Defined contribution
Obligations for contributions are recognised as an expense in the income statement as incurred. 
Defined benefit
The cost of providing benefits is determined periodically by independent actuaries and charged to the income statement in the period in which 
those benefits are earned by the employees. Remeasurements, including actuarial gains and losses, are recognised in the Consolidated statement 
of comprehensive income in the period in which they occur. Past service costs resulting from a plan amendment or curtailment are recognised 
immediately in the income statement. 
The retirement benefit surpluses and obligations recognised in the Group’s balance sheet represent the fair value of scheme assets, less the 
present value of the defined benefit obligations calculated using a number of actuarial assumptions as set out on page 178. The bid values of 
scheme assets are not intended to be realised in the short term and may be subject to significant change before they are realised. The present 
values of scheme liabilities are derived from cash flow projections over long periods and are, therefore, inherently uncertain.
IAS 19, Employee Benefits, limits the measurement of a defined benefit surplus to the lower of the surplus in the defined benefit scheme and the 
asset ceiling. The asset ceiling is the present value of any economic benefits available in the form of refunds from the scheme or reductions in future 
contributions to the scheme. IFRIC 14, IAS 19 – The Limit on a Defined Benefit Asset, Minimum Funding Requirements and their Interaction, issued 
in 2007, provides an interpretation of the requirements of IAS 19, clarifying that a refund is available if the entity has an unconditional right to a 
refund in certain circumstances. The Group has applied IFRIC 14 and has determined that there is no limit on the recognition of the surpluses in 
its defined benefit pension schemes as at 31 December 2017.
MBDA participates in the Group’s defined benefit schemes and, as these are multi-employer schemes, the Group has allocated a share of the 
IAS 19 pension surpluses and deficits to MBDA based on the relative payroll contributions of active members, which is consistent with prior years. 
Whilst this methodology is intended to reflect a reasonable estimate of the share of the deficit, it may not accurately reflect the obligations of the 
participating employers.
In the event that an employer who participates in the Group’s pension schemes fails or cannot be compelled to fulfil its obligations as a participating 
employer, the remaining participating employers are obliged to collectively take on its obligations. The Group considers the likelihood of this event 
arising as remote.
The Group’s share of the IAS 19 pension deficit allocated to the equity accounted investments is included in the balance sheet within equity 
accounted investments.

Background
Pension schemes
BAE Systems plc operates pension schemes for the Group’s qualifying employees in the UK, US and other countries. The principal schemes in the 
UK and US are funded defined benefit schemes, and the assets are held in separate trustee-administered funds. The two largest funded defined 
benefit schemes are the Main Scheme and the BAE Systems 2000 Pension Plan (2000 Plan) which, in aggregate, represent 81% (2016 69%) of 
the total IAS 19 defined benefit obligation at 31 December 2017. The schemes in other countries are primarily defined contribution schemes. 
At 31 December 2017, the weighted average durations of the UK and US defined benefit pension obligations were 18 years (2016 19 years) and 
12 years (2016 12 years), respectively.
The split of the defined benefit pension liability on a funding basis between active, deferred and pensioner members for the Main Scheme, 2000 
Plan and US schemes in aggregate is set out below:

Regulatory framework
The funded UK schemes are registered and subject to the statutory scheme specific-funding requirements outlined in UK legislation, including 
the payment of levies to the Pension Protection Fund as set out in the Pension Act 2004. These schemes were established under trust and the 
responsibility for their governance lies jointly with the trustees and the Group.
The funded US schemes are tax-qualified pension schemes regulated by the Pension Protection Act 2006 and insured by the Pension Benefit 
Guaranty Corporation (PBGC) up to certain limits. These schemes were established under and are governed by the US Employee Retirement 
Income Security Act 1974 and the BAE Systems Administrative Committee is a named fiduciary with the authority to manage their operation. 
Benefits
The UK defined benefit schemes provide benefits to members in the form of a set level of pension payable for life based on members’ final 
salaries. The benefits attract inflation-related increases both in deferment and payment. All UK defined benefit schemes are closed to new 
entrants, with benefits for new employees being provided through a defined contribution scheme. The Normal Retirement Age for active 
members of the Main Scheme and 2000 Plan is 65. Specific benefits applicable to members differ between schemes. Further details on the 
benefits provided by each scheme are provided on the BAE Systems Pensions website: baesystemspensions.com.
The US defined benefit schemes ceased to be final salary schemes in January 2013. The benefits accrued based on the final salaries of members 
at that point will become payable on retirement. The Normal Retirement Age for the largest scheme in the US is 65. 
Other retirement benefits
The Group operates a number of non-pension retirement benefit schemes, under which certain employees are eligible to receive benefits after 
retirement, the majority of which relate to the provision of medical benefits to retired employees of the Group’s subsidiaries in the US.

Funding 
Introduction
Disclosures in respect of pension funding are provided below. Disclosures in respect of pension accounting under IAS 19 are provided on pages 
178 to 183.
The majority of the UK and US defined benefit pension schemes are funded by the Group’s subsidiaries and equity accounted investments. 
The individual pension schemes’ funding requirements are based on actuarial measurement frameworks set out in their funding policies. 
For funding valuation purposes, pension scheme assets are included at market value at the valuation date, whilst the liabilities are measured 
on an actuarial funding basis using the projected unit credit method and discounted to their present value based on prudent assumptions set 
by the trustees following consultation with scheme actuaries.
The funding valuations are performed by professionally qualified independent actuaries and include assumptions which differ from the actuarial 
assumptions used for IAS 19 accounting purposes shown on page 178. The purpose of the funding valuations is to design funding plans which 
ensure that the schemes have sufficient funds available to meet future benefit payments.
UK valuations
Funding valuations of the Group’s nine UK defined benefit pension schemes are performed every three years. The latest valuations were 
performed as at 31 March 2017. The next funding valuation will have an effective date of no later than 31 March 2020.
In November, the 2017 triennial funding valuations and, where necessary, deficit recovery plans were agreed with the trustees and certified 
by the scheme actuaries after consultation with the UK Pensions Regulator. The funding valuations have resulted in a significantly lower deficit 
than under IAS 19.
The results of the most recent triennial valuations are shown below:
At 31 March 2017
Main
Scheme
£bn
2000  
Plan

Other

Total

Market value of assets 12.8 4.3 4.5 21.6
Present value of liabilities (14.4) (4.6) (4.7) (23.7)
Funding deficit (1.6) (0.3) (0.2) (2.1)
Percentage of accrued benefits covered by the assets at the valuation date 89% 93% 96% 91%
The valuations were determined using the following mortality assumptions:
2017
Life expectancy of a male currently aged 65 (years) 86 – 89
Life expectancy of a female currently aged 65 (years) 88 – 90
Life expectancy of a male currently aged 45 (years) 88 – 92
Life expectancy of a female currently aged 45 (years) 91 – 93
The discount rate assumptions are based on prudent levels of expected returns for the assets held by each of the schemes. The discount rates 
are curves which provide a different rate for each year into the future. The discount rates used in the 2014 valuation were based on a traditional 
gilts yield plus a margin which varied by scheme and over time. The discount rates used in the 2017 valuation are directly based on prudent return 
assumptions for the assets held by the schemes, reflecting the planned investment strategies and maturity profiles of each scheme.
The inflation assumptions are derived using data from the Bank of England which is based on the difference between the yields on index-linked 
and fixed interest long-term government bonds. The inflation assumption is a curve which provides a different rate for each year into the future.
In aggregate, the net funding deficit across the UK schemes at 31 March 2017 was £2.1bn. The funding deficit is approximately £3bn lower 
than the accounting deficit of the equivalent UK schemes prepared under IAS 19, using like-for-like mortality assumptions and asset values at 
31 December 2017, largely due to lower liabilities reflecting the higher discount rate assumption. Under IAS 19, the discount rate for accounting 
purposes is based on third-party AA corporate bond yields whereas, for funding valuation purposes, the discount rate is based on a prudent level 
of expected returns from the broader and mixed types of investments held in the schemes, which are expected to yield higher returns than bonds.
The agreements reached are underpinned by contingency plans, which include a commitment by the Group to a further £50m of deficit funding 
into the largest scheme prior to the next triennial valuation in the event that the scheme funding level was to fall below pre-determined parameters. 
In addition, the Group would be required to pay £187m across its schemes with deficits at the valuation date if the funding levels for those 
schemes were to fall significantly and were to remain at or below those levels for nine months.
There will be no change to the contributions or benefits, as set out in the rules of the schemes, for pension scheme members as a result of the 
new funding valuations.
The results of future triennial valuations and associated funding requirements will be impacted by a number of factors, including the future 
performance of investment markets and anticipated members’ longevity.
US valuations
The Group’s US pension schemes are valued annually, with the latest valuations performed as at 1 January 2017.

Contributions
Under the terms of the trust deeds of the UK schemes, the Group is required to have a funding plan determined at the conclusion of the triennial 
funding valuations.
Equity accounted investments make regular contributions to the schemes in which they participate in line with the schedule of contributions 
and are allocated a share of deficit funding contributions.
In 2017, total contributions to the Group’s pension schemes were £433m (2016 £461m), including amounts funded by equity accounted 
investments of £31m (2016 £50m), and included approximately £209m and £62m of deficit recovery payments in respect of the UK and 
US schemes, respectively. 
Based on the new funding valuations, current annual deficit recovery payments to the UK schemes, including amounts funded by equity 
accounted investments, will increase to £220m a year from 1 April 2018. Deficit contributions will further increase in line with any percentage 
growth in dividend payments made by the Group. Under the new deficit recovery plans, these annual payments would subsequently fall 
by £50m in 2022 as the deficits on certain schemes are expected to be cleared. The annual payments are expected to end in 2026 when 
all deficits are projected to be cleared. Under the last agreement made in 2014, all scheme deficits were projected to be cleared in 2026.
Based on the latest valuations of the Group’s US pension schemes, contributions are expected to remain at a level consistent with 2017 
through to 2022.
In 2018, the Group expects to make total contributions to its pension schemes of £0.5bn.
Risk management
The defined benefit pension schemes expose the Group to actuarial risks, including market (investment) risk, interest rate risk, inflation risk 
and longevity risk. 
Risk Mitigation
Market (investment) risk
Asset returns may not move 
in line with the liabilities and 
may be subject to volatility.
The investment portfolios are highly diversified, investing in a wide range of assets, in order to provide 
reasonable assurance that no single security or type of security could have a materially adverse impact 
on the total portfolio. To reduce volatility, certain assets are held in a matching portfolio, which largely 
consists of index-linked bonds, gilts and swaps, designed to mirror movements in corresponding liabilities.
Some 47% (2016 47%) of the Group’s pension scheme assets are held in equities and pooled investment 
vehicles due to the higher expected level of return over the long term.
Some of the Group’s pension schemes use derivative financial instruments as part of their investment 
strategy to manage the level of market risk. The Main Scheme has a long-dated equity option strategy 
protecting £1.4bn of assets against a significant fall in equity markets.
Interest rate risk
Liabilities are sensitive to 
movements in interest rates, 
with lower interest rates leading 
to an increase in the valuation 
of liabilities.
In addition to investing in bonds as part of the matching portfolio, some of the UK schemes invest in 
interest rate swaps to reduce the exposure to movements in interest rates. The swaps are held with several 
banks to reduce counterparty risk.
The discount rate assumptions set as part of the 2017 UK funding valuations more directly reflect the 
expected returns on assets held by the schemes and, therefore, the liabilities are less sensitive to interest 
rate risk than they were in the 2014 funding valuation. Accordingly, the 2017 approach provides a more 
natural hedge against interest rate risk. The planned investment strategy, which is reflected in the discount 
rate and liability calculation, is for the schemes to increase their investments in bonds or other assets 
which match the liabilities as the schemes mature. Under the 2017 UK funding valuation, the Group 
expects the schemes to be fully hedged against interest rate movements following a five-year transition 
period to the planned investment strategy.
Inflation risk 
Liabilities are sensitive to 
movements in inflation, with 
higher inflation leading to 
an increase in the valuation 
of liabilities.
In addition to investing in index-linked bonds as part of the matching portfolio, the principal UK schemes 
invest in long-term inflation swaps to reduce the exposure to movements in inflation. The swaps are held 
with several banks to reduce counterparty risk. The Group’s US schemes are not indexed with inflation.
The approach to the 2017 UK funding valuation provides a more natural hedge against inflation 
movements and, therefore, the liabilities are less sensitive to inflation risk than they were in the 2014 
funding valuation. Under the 2017 UK funding valuation approach, the Group is already fully hedged 
against inflation movements and, under the planned investment strategy, the Group aims to maintain 
a fully hedged position.
In 2014, the Main Scheme implemented a pension increase exchange to allow retired members to elect 
for a higher current pension in exchange for foregoing certain rights to future pension increases. 
Longevity risk
Liabilities are sensitive to 
life expectancy, with increases 
in life expectancies leading 
to an increase in the valuation 
of liabilities. 
Longevity adjustment factors are used in the majority of the UK pension schemes in order to adjust 
the pension benefits payable so as to share the cost of people living longer with employees. 
In 2013, with the agreement of the Company, the trustees of the 2000 Plan, Royal Ordnance Pension 
Scheme and Shipbuilding Industries Pension Scheme entered into arrangements with Legal & General 
to insure against longevity risk for the current pensioner population, covering a total of £4.4bn of pension 
scheme liabilities. These arrangements reduce the funding volatility relating to increasing life expectancy.

IAS 19 accounting
The disclosures below relate to post-retirement benefit schemes in the UK, US and other countries which are accounted for as defined benefit 
schemes in accordance with IAS 19.
Principal actuarial assumptions 
The assumptions used are estimates chosen from a range of possible actuarial assumptions which, due to the long-term nature of the obligation 
covered, may not necessarily occur in practice.

Rate of increase in pensions in payment (%) 1.6 – 3.7 1.7 – 3.7 1.8 – 3.6 n/a n/a n/a
Demographic assumptions
Life expectancy of a male currently aged 65 (years) 86 – 88 86 – 89 87 – 89 87 87 87
Life expectancy of a female currently aged 65 (years) 88 – 90 89 – 90 89 – 90 89 89 89
Life expectancy of a male currently aged 45 (years) 88 – 90 88 – 91 89 – 91 87 87 87
Life expectancy of a female currently aged 45 (years) 90 – 92 91 – 92 91 – 92 89 89 89
Discount rate
The discount rate assumptions are derived through discounting the projected benefit payments using a third-party AA corporate bond yield 
curve to produce a single equivalent discount rate for the UK and US territories. This inherently captures the maturity profile of the expected 
benefit payments. For the UK territory, the discount rate used for future service differs from that used for past service as it only uses the cash 
flows relating to active members, which have a different duration. Further information on the duration of the schemes is detailed on page 175. 
Retail Prices Index (RPI) inflation
In the UK, the inflation assumptions are derived by reference to the difference between the yields on index-linked and fixed-interest long-term 
government bonds, or advice from the local actuary depending on the available information. In the US, inflation assumptions are not relevant 
as the Group’s US pension schemes are not indexed with inflation.
Rate of increase in salaries
The rate of increase in salaries for the UK schemes is assumed to be RPI inflation of 3.1% (2016 RPI inflation of 3.2%), plus a promotional scale. 
From 1 January 2013, employees in the US schemes no longer accrue salary-related benefits.
Rate of increase in deferred pensions
The rate of increase in deferred pensions for the UK schemes is based on Consumer Prices Index (CPI) inflation of 2.1% (2016 CPI inflation 
of 2.2%), with the exception of the 2000 Plan, which is based on RPI inflation of 3.1% (2016 RPI inflation of 3.2%). For all UK schemes, the rate 
of increase in deferred pensions is subject to inflation caps. 
Rate of increase in pensions in payment
The rate of increase in pensions in payment differs between UK schemes. Different tranches of the schemes increase at rates based on either RPI 
or CPI inflation, and some are subject to an inflation cap. With the exception of two smaller schemes, the rate of increase in pensions in payment 
is based on RPI inflation.
Life expectancy
For its UK pension schemes, the Group has used the Self-Administered Pension Schemes S2 mortality tables based on year of birth (as published 
by the Institute of Actuaries) for both pensioner and non-pensioner members in conjunction with the results of an investigation into the actual 
mortality experience of scheme members and information on the demographic profile of the scheme’s membership. In addition, to allow for 
future improvements in longevity, the Continuous Mortality Investigation 2016 tables (published by the Institute of Actuaries) have been used 
(in 2016, the Continuous Mortality Investigation 2015 tables were used), with an assumed long-term rate of future annual mortality improvements 
of 1.25% (2016 1.25%), for both pensioner and non-pensioner members. 
In October 2015, the Society of Actuaries in the US released updated mortality assumptions reflecting the results of its comprehensive mortality 
study. For the majority of the US schemes, the mortality tables used at 31 December 2017 are a blend of the fully generational RP-2014 Aggregate 
table and the RP-2014 White Collar table, both projected using Scale MP-2017. The IRS have approved the new mortality tables to be adopted for 
funding valuation purposes from 2018.
US healthcare schemes
The latest valuations of the principal schemes, covering retiree medical and life insurance schemes in certain US subsidiaries, were performed by 
independent actuaries as at 1 January 2017. These valuations were rolled forward to reflect the information at 31 December 2017. The method of 
accounting for these is similar to that used for defined benefit pension schemes.
The assumption for long-term healthcare cost increases is 4.9% (2016 4.8%) based on the assumptions that the increases are 7.8% in 2017 
reducing to 4.5% by 2026 and 4.5% each year thereafter for pre-retirement, and 8.5% in 2017 reducing to 4.5% by 2026 and 4.5% each year 
thereafter for post-retirement.

The decrease in liabilities due to changes in mortality assumptions in the UK schemes reflects updated assumptions, both to base tables and 
future improvements.
Contributions in excess of service cost on an IAS 19 accounting basis of £151m are lower than on a funding basis (£271m) because the service 
cost is higher on an IAS 19 accounting basis.

Sensitivity analysis
The sensitivity information has been derived using scenario analysis from the actuarial assumptions as at 31 December 2017 and keeping all other 
assumptions as set out on page 178. 
Financial assumptions
The estimated impact of changes in the discount rate and inflation assumptions on the defined benefit pension obligation, together with the 
estimated impact on scheme assets, is shown in the table below. The estimated impact on scheme assets takes into account the Group’s risk 
management activities in respect of interest rate and inflation risk. The sensitivity analysis on the defined benefit obligation is measured on 
an IAS 19 accounting basis and, therefore, does not reflect the natural hedging in the discount rate used for funding valuation purposes.
(Increase)/decrease

1
£bn
Increase/(decrease)
in scheme assets
1
£bn
Discount rate:
0.1 percentage point increase 0.5 (0.2)
0.1 percentage point decrease (0.5) 0.2
Inflation: 
0.1 percentage point increase (0.5) 0.2
0.1 percentage point decrease 0.5 (0.2)
1. Before allocation to equity accounted investments.
The sensitivity of the valuation of the liabilities to changes in the inflation assumption presented above assumes that a 0.1 percentage point 
change to expectations of future inflation results in a 0.1 percentage point change to all inflation-related assumptions (rate of increase in salaries, 
rate of increase in deferred pensions and rate of increase in pensions in payment) used to value the liabilities. However, upper and lower limits 
exist on the majority of inflation-related benefits such that a change in expectations of future inflation may not have the same impact on the 
inflation-related benefits, and hence will result in a smaller change to the valuation of the liabilities. Accordingly, extrapolation of the above results 
beyond the specific sensitivity figures shown may not be appropriate. To illustrate this, the (increase)/decrease in the defined benefit pension 
obligation resulting from larger changes in the inflation assumption would be as follows:
(Increase)/decrease

22. Provisions
A provision is recognised in the balance sheet when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event, it is probable 
that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation and the amount has been reliably estimated. If the effect is material, 
provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at an appropriate pre-tax discount rate.
Warranties and after-sales service
Warranties and after-sales service are provided in the normal course of business with provisions for associated costs being made based on an 
assessment of future claims with reference to past experience. A provision for warranties is recognised when the underlying products and services 
are sold. The provision is based on historical warranty data and a weighting of possible outcomes against their associated probabilities.
Reorganisations
A provision for restructuring is recognised when the Group has approved a detailed and formal restructuring plan, and the restructuring has either 
commenced or has been publicly announced. The costs associated with the reorganisation programmes are supported by detailed plans and 
based on previous experience as well as other known factors. Future operating costs are not provided for.
Legal, contractual and environmental
The Group holds provisions for expected legal, contractual and environmental costs that it expects to incur over an extended period. Management 
exercises judgement to determine the amount of these provisions. Provision is made for known issues based on past experience of similar items 
and other known factors. Each provision is considered separately and the amount provided reflects the best estimate of the most likely amount, 
being the single most likely amount in a range of possible outcomes.

1. There are no individual provision releases in excess of £10m.
Warranties and after-sales service 
Warranty and after-sales service costs are generally incurred within three years post-delivery. Whilst actual events could result in potentially 
significant differences to the quantum, but not the timing, of the outflows in relation to the provisions, management has reflected current 
knowledge in assessing the provision levels. 
Reorganisations 
Reorganisation costs are generally incurred within one to three years. There is limited volatility around the timing and amount of the ultimate 
outflows related to these provisions. 
Other debtors includes £89m which is reimbursable in respect of reorganisation costs incurred in 2017 (see note 12).
Legal, contractual and environmental 
Reflecting the inherent uncertainty within many legal proceedings, the amount of the outflows could differ significantly from the amount 
provided and the timing of the outflows cannot be reliably estimated.
Other 
There are no individually significant provisions included within other provisions.

Special Share
One Special Share of £1 in the Company is held on behalf of the Secretary of State for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (the Special 
Shareholder). Certain provisions of the Company’s Articles of Association cannot be amended without the consent of the Special Shareholder. 
These provisions include the requirement that no foreign person, or foreign persons acting in concert, can have more than a 15% voting interest 
in the Company, the requirement that the majority of the directors are British, and the requirement that the Chief Executive and any executive 
Chairman are British citizens. The effect of these requirements can also be amended by regulations made by the directors and approved by the 
Special Shareholder.
The Special Shareholder may require the Company at any time to redeem the Special Share at par or to convert the Special Share into one 
ordinary voting share. The Special Shareholder is entitled to receive notice of and to attend general meetings and class meetings of the Company’s 
shareholders, but has no voting right, nor other rights, other than to speak in relation to any business in respect of the Special Share.
Treasury shares
As at 31 December 2017, 281,232,739 (2016 291,449,361) ordinary shares of 2.5p each with an aggregate nominal value of £7,030,818 
(2016 £7,286,234) were held in treasury. During 2017, 10,216,622 (2016 10,358,742) treasury shares were used to satisfy awards and options 
under the Share Incentive Plan, International Share Incentive Plan, Performance Share Plan, Restricted Share Plan and Executive Share Option Plan. 
Own shares held
Own shares held, including treasury shares and shares held by BAE Systems Employee Share Option Plan (ESOP) Trust, are recognised as a deduction 
from retained earnings. 
BAE Systems ESOP Trust 
The Group has an ESOP discretionary trust to administer the share plans and to acquire Company shares, using funds loaned by the Group, to meet 
commitments to Group employees. Dividend waivers were in operation for shares within the ESOP Trust, other than those owned beneficially by 
the participants, for the dividends paid in June and November 2017. 
At 31 December 2017, the ESOP held 1,680,035 (2016 1,327,731) ordinary shares of 2.5p each, with a market value of £10m (2016 £8m). The 
shares held by the ESOP are recorded at cost and deducted from retained earnings until such time as the shares vest unconditionally to employees. 
A dividend waiver was also in operation for the dividends paid in June and November 2017 over shares within the Company’s share incentive plan 
trusts other than those shares owned beneficially by the participants.
Equity dividends
Equity dividends on ordinary share capital are recognised as a liability in the period in which they are declared. The interim dividend is recognised 
when it has been approved by the Board and the final dividend is recognised when it has been approved by the shareholders at the Annual 
General Meeting.
2017

684 670
After the balance sheet date, the directors proposed a final dividend of 13p per ordinary share. The dividend, which is subject to shareholder 
approval, will be paid on 1 June 2018 to shareholders registered on 20 April 2018. The ex-dividend date is 19 April 2018.
Shareholders who do not at present participate in the Company’s Dividend Reinvestment Plan and wish to receive the final dividend in shares 
rather than cash should complete a mandate form for the Dividend Reinvestment Plan and return it to the registrars no later than 10 May 2018.

Merger reserve
The merger reserve arose on the acquisition of the Marconi Electronic Systems (MES) business by British Aerospace in 1999 to form BAE Systems, 
and represents the amount by which the fair value of the shares issued by British Aerospace as consideration exceeded their nominal value. 
Statutory reserve
Under Section 4 of the British Aerospace Act 1980, this reserve may only be applied in paying up unissued shares of the Company to be allotted 
to members of the Company as fully paid bonus shares.
Revaluation reserve
The revaluation reserve relates to the revaluation at fair value of the net assets of the BVT joint venture previously held as an equity accounted 
investment on the acquisition of the remaining 45% interest in 2009.
Capital redemption reserve
The capital redemption reserve represents the cumulative nominal value of the Company’s ordinary shares repurchased and subsequently cancelled. 
Hedging reserve
The hedging reserve comprises the effective portion of the cumulative net change in the fair value of cash flow hedging instruments related 
to hedged transactions that have not yet occurred. 
Translation reserve
The translation reserve comprises all foreign currency differences arising from the translation of the financial statements of foreign operations.
Capital
The Group funds its operations through a mixture of equity funding and debt financing, including bank and capital market borrowings.
At 31 December 2017, the Group’s capital was £4,725m (2016 £3,454m), which comprises total equity of £4,784m (2016 £3,464m), excluding 
amounts accumulated in equity relating to cash flow hedges of £59m (2016 £10m). Net debt was £752m (2016 £1,542m).
The capital structure of the Group reflects the judgement of the directors of an appropriate balance of funding required. The Group’s policy is 
to maintain an investment grade credit rating and ensure operating flexibility, whilst: 
– meeting its pension obligations;
– pursuing organic investment opportunities; 
– paying dividends in line with the Group’s policy of long-term sustainable cover of around two times underlying earnings (see note 7);
– making accelerated returns of capital to shareholders when the balance sheet allows and when the return from doing so is in excess 
of the Group’s Weighted Average Cost of Capital; and
– investing in value-enhancing acquisitions, where market conditions are right and where they deliver on the Group’s strategy.

Annual Report 2017 27. Fair value measurement
Fair value of financial instruments
Certain of the Group’s financial instruments are held at fair value.
The fair value of a financial instrument is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction 
between market participants at the balance sheet date.
The fair values of financial instruments held at fair value have been determined based on available market information at the balance sheet date, 
and the valuation methodologies listed below:
– the fair values of forward foreign exchange contracts are calculated by discounting the contracted forward values and translating at the 
appropriate balance sheet rates; and
– the fair values of both interest rate and cross-currency swaps are calculated by discounting expected future principal and interest cash flows 
and translating at the appropriate balance sheet rates. 
Due to the variability of the valuation factors, the fair values presented at 31 December may not be indicative of the amounts the Group would 
expect to realise in the current market environment.
Fair value hierarchy
The fair value measurement hierarchy is as follows:
– Level 1 – Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities; 
– Level 2 – Inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) 
or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices); and
– Level 3 – Inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (i.e. unobservable inputs).

1. US$500m of the US$800m 3.8% bond, repayable 2024, has been converted to a floating rate bond by utilising interest rate swaps. These derivatives have been designated 
as fair value hedges. Changes in the fair value of the interest rate risk on the bond, and gains and losses on the derivatives are recognised in the income statement. The bond 
has been included in financial instruments not measured at fair value because its carrying value has only been adjusted for the fair value of the interest rate risk on a portion 
of the bond, which has been calculated by discounting the future cash flows and translating at the appropriate balance sheet rate.
All of the financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value are classified as level 2 using the fair value hierarchy. There were no transfers 
between levels during the year. 
Financial assets and liabilities in the Group’s Consolidated balance sheet are either held at fair value or their carrying value approximates to fair 
value, with the exception of loans, most of which are held at amortised cost. The fair value of loans presented in the table above is derived from 
market prices.

28. Financial risk management
Interest rate risk
The Group’s objective is to manage its exposure to interest rate fluctuations on borrowings through varying the proportion of fixed rate debt 
relative to floating rate debt with derivative instruments, including interest rate and cross-currency swaps. 
The Group’s interest rate management policy is that a minimum of 50% (2016 50%) and a maximum of 90% (2016 90%) of gross debt is 
maintained at fixed interest rates. At 31 December 2017, the Group had 82% (2016 81%) of fixed rate debt and 18% (2016 19%) of floating 
rate debt based on a gross debt of £4.0bn, including debt-related derivative financial assets (2016 £4.3bn).
Based on contracted maturities and/or repricing dates, the following amounts are exposed to interest rate risk over the future as shown below:

The floating rate debt has been predominantly achieved by entering into interest rate swaps which swap the fixed rate US dollar interest payable 
on debt into either floating rate sterling or US dollars. At the end of 2017, the Group had a total of $1.0bn (2016 $1.0bn) of this type of swap 
outstanding with a weighted average duration of 5.6 years (2016 2.6 years). In respect of the fixed rate debt, the weighted average period in 
respect of which interest is fixed was 9.5 years (2016 11.6 years).
Given the level of short-term interest rates during the year, the average cost of the floating rate debt was 4.6% (2016 4.1%) on US dollars. 
The cost of the fixed rate debt was 4.9% (2016 4.8%). 
A change of 100 basis points in short-term rates applied to the average fixed/floating mix and level of borrowings would vary the interest cost 
to the Group by £7m (2016 £8m). 
In respect of cash deposits, given the fluctuation in the Group’s working capital requirements, cash is generally invested for short-term periods 
based at floating interest rates. A change of 100 basis points in the average interest rates during the year applied to the average cash deposits 
would vary the interest receivable by £14m (2016 £14m).

Annual Report 2017 28. Financial risk management continued
Borrowing facilities
The Group’s objective is to maintain adequate undrawn committed borrowing facilities. 
At 31 December 2017, the Group had a committed Revolving Credit Facility (RCF) of £2bn (2016 £2bn). The RCF is contracted until 2018 at 
£2bn and from 2018 to 2020 at £1.9bn. The RCF was undrawn throughout the year. The RCF also acts as a back stop to Commercial Paper 
issued by the Group. At 31 December 2017, the Group had no Commercial Paper in issue (2016 £nil).
Cash management
Cash flow forecasting is performed by the businesses on a monthly basis. The Group monitors a rolling forecast of its liquidity requirements 
to ensure that there is sufficient cash to meet operational needs and maintain adequate headroom. 
Surplus cash held by the businesses over and above balances required for working capital management is loaned to the Group’s centralised 
treasury department. Surplus cash is invested in instant-access current accounts, short-term deposits and money market funds, choosing 
instruments with appropriate maturities or sufficient liquidity to provide adequate headroom as determined by cash forecasts. 
The Group’s objective is to monitor and control counterparty credit risk and credit limit utilisation. The Group adopts a conservative approach 
to the investment of its surplus cash which is deposited with financial institutions with strong credit ratings for short periods. The cash and 
cash equivalents balance at 31 December 2017 of £3,271m (2016 £2,769m) was invested with 33 (2016 33) financial institutions. A credit limit 
is allocated to each institution taking account of its market capitalisation, credit rating and credit default swap price. 
The cash and cash equivalents of the Group are invested in non-speculative financial instruments which are usually highly liquid, such 
as short-term deposits. The Group, therefore, believes it has reduced its exposure to counterparty credit risk through this process. 
Currency risk
The Group’s objective is to reduce its exposure to transactional volatility in earnings and cash flows from movements in foreign currency 
exchange rates, mainly the US dollar, euro, Saudi riyal and Australian dollar.
The Group is exposed to movements in foreign currency exchange rates in respect of foreign currency denominated transactions. All material 
firm transactional exposures are hedged and the Group aims, where possible, to apply hedge accounting to these transactions.
The Group is exposed to movements in foreign currency exchange rates in respect of the translation of net assets and income statements of 
foreign subsidiaries and equity accounted investments. The Group does not hedge the translation effect of exchange rate movements on the 
income statements or balance sheets of foreign subsidiaries and equity accounted investments it regards as long-term investments.
The estimated impact on foreign exchange gains and losses in net finance costs of a ten cent movement in the closing US dollar exchange rate 
on the retranslation of US dollar-denominated bonds held by BAE Systems plc is approximately £49m (2016 £59m).
Credit risk 
The Group has material receivables due from the UK, US and Saudi Arabian governments where credit risk is not considered an issue. For the 
remaining trade receivables, a provision for bad debts has been calculated taking into account individual assessments based on past credit history 
and prior knowledge of debtor insolvency or other credit risk, and no one counterparty constitutes more than 2% of the balance (2016 11%).
The ageing of trade receivables is detailed below:

29. Share-based payments
The Group has granted equity-settled share options and Long-Term Incentive Plan arrangements which are measured at fair value at the date 
of grant using an option pricing model. The fair value is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on the Group’s estimate 
of the number of shares that will actually vest.
Details of the terms and conditions of each share-based payment plan are given in the Annual remuneration report on pages 96 to 115.

31. Contingent liabilities
Contingent liabilities are potential future cash outflows which are either not probable or cannot be measured reliably.
The Group has entered into a number of guarantee and performance bond arrangements in the normal course of business and regards these 
as insurance contracts. Various Group undertakings are parties to legal actions and claims which arise in the normal course of business. Provision 
is made for any amounts that the directors consider may become payable (see note 22).
The Group has no individually significant contingent liabilities.
32. Commitments

Annual Report 2017 34. Adoption of IFRS 15, Revenue from Contracts with Customers
Adoption of IFRS 15
From 1 January 2018, the Group will adopt IFRS 15, Revenue from 
Contracts with Customers. The standard replaces IAS 11, Construction 
Contracts, IAS 18, Revenue, and all other existing revenue accounting 
requirements within IFRS. It applies to all revenue arising from contracts 
with customers unless the contracts are within the scope of other 
existing standards, such as IAS 17, Leases.
IFRS 15 outlines principles for the measurement and recognition of 
revenue from contracts with customers, with the core principle being 
that revenue should be recognised at an amount that reflects the 
consideration to which an entity expects to be entitled in exchange for 
the transfer of goods and services to the customer. In order to achieve 
this objective, the standard sets out a five-step model:
1. Identify the contract(s) with a customer.
2. Identify the performance obligations in the contract.
3. Determine the transaction price.
4.  Allocate the transaction price to the performance 
obligations in the contract.
5.  Recognise revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies 
a performance obligation.
The standard also covers the accounting for the incremental costs 
of obtaining a contract and the costs to fulfil a contract, together 
with presentation and disclosure requirements.
The Group will adopt IFRS 15 fully retrospectively in accordance with 
paragraph C3 (a). Comparatives for the year ended 31 December 2017 
will be restated.
Impact of adoption of IFRS 15
Revenue recognition
– Revenue on the majority of contracts, currently being recognised 
based on the completion of milestones or deliveries, will cumulatively 
be recognised earlier.
Under IAS 11, revenue under long-term contracts is recognised when 
a separately identifiable phase (milestone) has been completed. Under 
IAS 18, revenue from the sale of goods not under long-term contracts 
is recognised when the significant risks and rewards of ownership have 
been transferred to the customer, for example, upon delivery.
The Group has determined that the performance obligations identified 
in the majority of its contracts will satisfy the criteria in IFRS 15 for 
recognition over time rather than at a point in time. In order to qualify 
for revenue recognition over time, the Group’s performance must not 
create assets with alternative uses and it must have an enforceable right 
to payment for performance completed to date. The majority of the 
Group’s products are designed and/or manufactured under contract to 
the customer’s individual specifications. The Group is, therefore, limited 
in its ability to sell its products to alternative customers due to the 
substantial rework costs involved.
Under IAS 11, the recognition of revenue over time based on 
milestones gives rise to work-in-progress in respect of costs expended 
in pursuit of milestones which have not been completed at the balance 
sheet date. Under IFRS 15, it is not deemed appropriate to recognise 
significant work-in-progress as an asset on the Group’s balance sheet 
when revenue is recognised over time as the Standard considers the 
control of the work-in-progress to have been transferred to the 
customer. Consequently, under IFRS 15, the Group will recognise 
revenue based on costs incurred reflecting the continuous transfer 
of the benefit of the Group’s performance to the customer.
The adoption of IFRS 15 will not impact contracts for the provision of 
services currently accounted for on the basis of the stage of completion 
measured on the basis of either direct expenses incurred or labour 
hours delivered as these have already been determined to meet the 
criteria for over time revenue recognition.
If the over time criteria for revenue recognition are not met, revenue 
is recognised at the point in time that control is transferred to the 
customer, which is usually when legal title passes and the business 
has the right to payment.

34. Adoption of IFRS 15, Revenue from Contracts with Customers continued
Profit recognition
– Profit on contracts will continue to be recognised progressively 
as risks have been mitigated or retired.
– Profit will be recognised earlier on shorter-term contracts in the 
Group’s US businesses.
– On contracts for both development and production in the Group’s 
MBDA joint venture, there will be lower profit recognised during 
the development phase.
On the majority of the Group’s contracts, profit is calculated by 
reference to reliable estimates of contract revenue and costs after 
making suitable allowances for technical and other risks related 
to performance milestones yet to be achieved. No profit is recognised 
until the outcome of a contract can be reliably estimated. Profit is 
recognised progressively as risks have been mitigated or retired. 
Forecast losses are recognised immediately in full.
On adoption of IFRS 15, profit on these contracts will continue to 
be recognised progressively on this basis.
In the Group’s Platforms & Services (UK) and Platforms & Services 
(International) businesses, contracts are typically longer-term in nature 
than in the Group’s other businesses. Whilst the recognition of revenue 
is accelerated under IFRS 15 as a result of the measure of progress 
being based on costs incurred, there is less impact on the timing of 
recognition of profit as, operationally, the next risk retirement point 
will still not have been achieved on the contract. Conversely, in the 
Group’s US businesses, contracts are typically shorter-term, with 
cumulative profit to date traded at close to out-turn margin. 
Accordingly, the acceleration of revenue recognised under IFRS 15 
will accelerate profit recognition on the Group’s US contracts.
The Group’s MBDA joint venture is undertaking a number of significant 
contracts which include both development and production elements. 
Under IAS 11, MBDA has previously recognised profit on contracts 
with both development and production elements at a single blended 
out-turn profit margin. Under IFRS 15, the development and production 
elements of the contract represent separate performance obligations, 
with development satisfied over time and production, typically, satisfied 
at a point in time. The development activity on these contracts has a 
lower margin than the subsequent production activity and, therefore, 
under IFRS 15, less profit is allocated to development, with more 
allocated to production.
Licence revenue
– Some licence revenue in Applied Intelligence originally recognised 
upfront under IAS 18 will be deferred and recognised over the 
licence term under IFRS 15.
BAE Systems Applied Intelligence generates revenue from the sale of 
licences of its intellectual property. The licences have varying terms and 
conditions and can be provided for a fixed term or in perpetuity. Under 
IAS 18, the Group recognises revenue in respect of software licences in 
line with the substance of those transactions, either on delivery to the 
customer or spread over the licence term (typically five years) or, in 
relation to perpetual licences, over the related customer relationship.
The Group has determined that, under IFRS 15, certain licences that 
qualified for upfront recognition under IAS 18 in its Applied Intelligence 
business represent the right to access the Group’s intellectual property 
on the basis that the customers have an expectation that the Group 
will provide significant updates to the software during the licence term 
to ensure its continuing value to the customer. Accordingly, revenue 
relating to these licences is deferred and recognised over the licence 
term under IFRS 15 rather than being recognised upfront under IAS 18.
Financing
– No financing (as defined by IFRS 15) in the Group’s contracts.
IFRS 15 states that the consideration in a contract must be adjusted 
for the time value of money if the timing of payments either explicitly 
or implicitly provides the customer or the entity with a significant 
benefit of financing the transfer of goods or services to the customer.
In the ordinary course of business, certain of the Group’s businesses 
can receive down-payments from customers in advance of the delivery 
of the contracted products and services. Advances are not significant 
in the Group’s US businesses. At 31 December 2017, advances from 
long-term contract customers totalled £2.9bn.
The advances received are typically utilised within 12 months of 
the balance sheet date. As such, the Group can apply the practical 
expedient in IFRS 15 by which revenue does not have to be adjusted 
for financing if the period between the down-payment and the 
recognition of the related revenue is one year or less.
The Group also had £1.7bn and £0.3bn of progress payments 
allocated to long-term and short-term work-in-progress, respectively, 
at 31 December 2017. On transition to IFRS 15, most of this work-in-
progress, and associated progress payments, will be recognised 
as revenue.
Balance sheet
– Most balance sheet contract work-in-progress replaced with 
a contract receivable representing accrued revenue, based on 
costs incurred, and including attributable profit.
Under IAS 11, fulfilment costs incurred on the Group’s contracts are 
carried in the balance sheet until the associated revenue is recognised 
upon achievement of performance milestones. Under IFRS 15, it is not 
appropriate to recognise significant work-in-progress as an asset 
on the Group’s balance sheet when revenue is recognised over time. 
Accordingly, contract work-in-progress, both short-term and long-term, 
is replaced with a contract receivable representing accrued revenue, 
based on costs incurred, and including attributable profit. Inventories 
will include fulfilment costs incurred in advance of delivery in respect 
of contracts with customers which have been determined to fulfil the 
criteria for point in time revenue recognition, together with products 
manufactured to stock without contract cover.
Impact on reported results
The Group will adopt IFRS 15 fully retrospectively in accordance 
with paragraph C3 (a). Provisional comparatives for the year ended 
31 December 2017 are shown in the following tables.

Prior year restatement
The Company has restated comparatives for the year ended 
31 December 2016 to recognise a £250m increase in investments 
in subsidiary undertakings and a corresponding increase in 
non-distributable retained earnings, representing the cost of the 
Free and Matching elements of the Share Incentive Plan awarded to 
employees of subsidiary undertakings. The Company had previously 
recognised the cost of these awards in the income statement, with 
a corresponding credit in equity. Accordingly, investments and 
non-distributable retained earnings at 1 January 2016 have increased 
by £220m and profit for the year ended 31 December 2016 has 
increased by £30m.

Company audit fee
Fees payable to the Company’s auditor for the audit of the Company’s annual accounts totalled £2,034,000 (2016 £1,776,000).
Related party transactions
Disclosures in respect of related party transactions are provided in note 30 to the Group accounts.
The Company also has amounts receivable from Aircraft Accessories and Co. Limited of £7m (2016 £nil) and Aircraft Research Association Limited 
of £4m (2016 £1m) which are not wholly-owned subsidiaries.
The Company also has a related party relationship with its directors and key management personnel, and pension schemes.
Directors’ emoluments
Under Schedule 5 of the Large and Medium-Sized Companies and Groups (Accounts and Reports) Regulations 2008 (Schedule 5), total directors’ 
emoluments, excluding Company pension contributions, were £8,748,961 (2016 £10,806,172); these amounts are calculated on a different basis 
to emoluments in the Annual remuneration report which are calculated under Schedule 8 of the Large and Medium-Sized Companies and 
Groups (Accounts and Reports) (Amendment) Regulations 2013 (Schedule 8 (2013)). These emoluments were paid for their services on behalf 
of the BAE Systems Group. No emoluments related specifically to their work for the Company. Under Schedule 5, the aggregate gains made 
by the directors from the exercise of share options in 2017 as at the date of exercise was £1,002,325 (2016 £158,125) and the net aggregate 
value of assets received by directors in 2017 from Long-Term Incentive Plans as calculated at the date of vesting was £1,016,511 (2016 £nil); 
these amounts are calculated on a different basis from the valuation of share plan benefits under Schedule 8 (2013) in the Annual remuneration 
report. Retirement benefits are accruing to one director in respect of defined benefit schemes and to two directors in respect of defined 
contribution schemes.
Company guaranteed borrowings
Borrowings by subsidiary undertakings totalling £3,010m (2016 £3,295m), which are included in the Group’s borrowings, have been guaranteed

BEWARE OF SHARE FRAUD
Fraudsters use persuasive and high-pressure tactics to lure investors into scams.
They may offer to sell shares that turn out to be worthless or non-existent, or to buy shares at an inflated price in return for an upfront payment.
While high profits are promised, if you buy or sell shares in this way you will probably lose your money.
Victims of share fraud lose an average of £20,000 to these scams, with as much as £200m being lost in the UK each year.
How to avoid share fraud 
1. Keep in mind that firms authorised by the FCA are unlikely to 
contact you out of the blue with an offer to buy or sell shares.
6. Call the FCA on 0800 111 6768 if the firm does not have contact 
details on the Register or you are told they are out of date.
2. Do not get into a conversation, note the name of the person 
and firm contacting you and then end the call.
7. Search the list of unauthorised firms to avoid at 
scamsmart.fca.org.uk/warninglist
3. Check the Financial Services Register from fca.org.uk 
to see if the person and firm contacting you is authorised 
by the FCA.
8. Consider that if you buy or sell shares from an unauthorised firm 
you will not have access to the Financial Ombudsman Service or 
Financial Services Compensation Scheme.
4. Beware of fraudsters claiming to be from an authorised firm, 
copying its website or giving you false contact details.
9. Think seriously about getting independent financial and 
professional advice before you hand over any money.
5. Use the firm’s contact details listed on the Register if you want 
to call it back.
10. Remember: if it sounds too good to be true, it probably is!
Report a scam 
If you are approached by fraudsters please tell the FCA using the FCA Consumer Helpline on 0800 111 6768, or the share fraud reporting 
form at fca.org.uk/scams, where you can also find out more about investment scams.
If you have already paid money to share fraudsters you should contact Action Fraud on 0300 123 2040 or online at actionfraud.police.uk
