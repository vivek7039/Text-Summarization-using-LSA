OVERVIEW
CHAIRMAN’S STATEMENT 
Dear Shareholder
I am very pleased to present my first 
Annual Report as Chairman, following my 
appointment in January 2018, and am 
delighted to have joined Centaur at such 
an interesting time. A great deal has been 
achieved in the past four years in transitioning 
Centaur Media into a more focused B2B 
information group. I am looking forward 
to working with the Board and supporting 
the broader management team to take 
advantage of the opportunities ahead. 
All businesses are facing challenges driven 
by the constantly evolving digital backdrop 
and the increasing competition for attention 
and performance. Centaur is successfully 
managing its own adaption to this changing 
landscape by reducing its exposure to print 
advertising and growing its higher quality 
digital recurring revenues. 
The Group has invested in building an 
outstanding portfolio of business intelligence 
products that helps its clients by providing 
valuable information, analytics and insight, 
allowing them to maximise the value of this 
through advisory services, media channels 
and events to help connect with their 
customers. 
In the relatively short period that I have  
been Chairman, my time has been spent 
learning about the business, the market 
dynamics and the opportunities ahead.  
I have been impressed by the quality and 
commitment of the team across all areas.  
I am still in the process of fully understanding 
every aspect of the Group, and this is 
my immediate focus. However, my first 
impressions are that there is clear potential 
and I am confident we can build on the 
transformation work already completed and 
take the business forward both organically 
and through further strategic acquisitions. 
Group performance 
It has been a satisfactory year in terms of 
underlying
1
 performance with our continuing 
operations reporting an adjusted operating 
profit² of £4.1m in the year against £4.2m in 
2016. This is despite the continued decline 
in advertising revenues which has been 
compensated for by our expansion into 
capability services through the acquisition  
of MarketMakers.
Including the results of the Home Interest 
Segment to the date of disposal, our 
adjusted operating profit² was £6.6m, down 
from £9.1m in 2016 with revenue remaining 
flat at £72.6m (2016: £72.5m).
Following our strategic decision to dispose 
of our last B2C segment, Home Interest, we 
recorded a £20.9m profit on disposal of this 
area of our business. This drove a reported 
total comprehensive income of £21.9m for 
the year. Fully diluted earnings per share 
were 14.3p (2016: (3.8p)). On an adjusted² 
results basis, earnings per share was 3.2p 
(2016: 4.5p). 
Cash generation has remained excellent 
over the year and I am pleased to report 
continued excellent progress so far in 2018. 
This, combined with the excess proceeds 
of the Home Interest Segment disposal, 
gives us the firepower to drive our strategic 
growth agenda.
Strategic progress
2017 was a year when the Group was able 
to take advantage of the hard work that 
began in 2014. The measurable improvement 
of the quality of the revenue mix reflects 
management’s careful reduction of exposure 
to print and advertising revenues alongside 
development of new insight-led revenue 
streams.
The strategic transactions over the past 
year have reinforced this focus and have 
created greater opportunities to offer 
complementary services to customers. 
The disposal of the B2C Home Interest 
Segment was a key milestone, creating 
a pure B2B focused group and enabling 
the acquisition of MarketMakers, a lead 
generation powerhouse. MarketMakers is 
now fully integrated and is already having 
a positive impact across the Group. Whilst 
growing its own client base it is also creating 
opportunities to cross-sell our services to our 
existing client base. 
Board changes
On behalf of the Board, I would like to 
thank my predecessor, Ron Sandler, for his 
significant contribution to the Group over the 
years. His advice and insight were of great 
value during this important period of change 
and transformation away from a publishing 
media business to a pure play B2B business 
information group. We wish him the very best 
with his future endeavours. 
Governance
Centaur remains fully committed to the 
highest standards of corporate governance 
and the Board takes very seriously its duties 
to operate with integrity, transparency 
and clear accountability. It also pays close 
attention to understanding and managing 
risk. Detail of what this means in practice is 
contained within the Governance section of 
the Annual Report.
Our people
On behalf of the Board, I would like to thank 
all our employees for their commitment and 
hard work this year. Their dedication remains 
essential in helping us to achieve our goals. 
The Group has seen a great deal of change 
but throughout this everyone has remained 
focused on providing the services and 
support our customers’ value. I look forward 
to getting to know more people across 
the business and working with them in the 
months and years ahead.
Dividend
In light of the full year performance, the 
Board is recommending a final dividend of 
1.5p per share, to give an unchanged total 
dividend for the year of 3.0p per share. The 
Board will continue to keep its dividend 
policy under review.
Outlook
I believe there are many opportunities 
available to the business. Last year was a 
year of important operational progress and 
2018 has started well. I am confident in the 
outlook of the Group and focused upon 
ensuring that Centaur delivers long-term 
value for our clients and shareholders.

Centaur Media Plc Annual Report and Financial Statements for the year ended 31 December 2017
STRATEGY
Background and context 
Centaur began its transformation programme in 2014. Its strategy 
is based on the Group’s ability to use legacy print brands, editorial 
expertise and connections to build longer term, sustainable higher 
quality revenue streams. This focus has driven Centaur to reshape 
and refocus its portfolio through organic innovation, disposals  
and acquisitions. 
To achieve this transformation Centaur has to navigate some critical 
yet potentially conflicting hurdles. The Group needs to:
Centaur Media offers professionals products and  
services that accelerate their business performance. 
Explore and build longer term, sustainable,  
higher quality revenue streams – i.e. invest in digital 
intelligence products development
Maximise contribution from the rapidly  
declining but highly profitable advertising  
revenues in the short term
Reshape and focus the portfolio through  
successful execution of organic innovation  
and disposals and acquisitions
Maintain shareholder support 
To achieve its goal within these tight parameters, management is 
employing a gradual, year-on-year ‘balanced’ approach which has 
delivered attractive dividends to shareholders alongside the digital 
product investment required to deliver long-term organic growth.
Early improvements made to the heritage publishing products 
have enabled the Group to maximise highly profitable advertising 
revenues in the short-term, facilitating the digital product investment 
which is slowly reshaping the Group through organic innovation. 
By focusing on content that engages key professional communities, 
the Group is creating insight-led products and services which are 
valued and which professionals are willing to buy and subscribe to.

STRATEGIC REPORT
A higher quality revenue mix
The investment into digital intelligence products and our acquisitions 
in marketing advisory services is enabling us to broaden our 
services to our core clients and build revenues of a higher quality as 
we reduce our reliance on advertising revenues. 
Whilst total print revenue has fallen over the last four years from 
generating 24% of total income in 2014 to 10% in 2017, new paid 
for products like events, e-learning, subscriptions and advisory 
services are successfully replacing the declining advertising 
revenues on which the Group was reliant. 
Recurring and repeat revenues have grown consistently and now 
make up 44% of total revenue:
• Excluding MarketMakers, digital premium content revenues have 
grown from c.£14m in 2014 (19% of total revenue) to £18m in 
2017 (26% of total revenue)
• Exhibition revenues have grown from c.£8.0m to c.£10m 
(excluding Home Interest/Aidex)

This strategy to drive cross selling of business information will not 
only deliver organic growth by improving customer lifetime value,  
but also enables the Group to become less dependent on tactical 
trade advertising. 
Strategic portfolio progress 
The last 12 months was a pivotal year when the Group made the 
switch it had been striving for and became truly digital-first as it 
substantially reduced the number of print magazine issues produced 
each year from over 300 to less than 75. The success of building 
a portfolio of digital intelligence products such as Econsultancy, 
Celebrity Intelligence, Fashion & Beauty Monitor, The Lawyer and 
Platforum, as well as the Business Travel Show and Festival of 
Marketing events, allowed the transition away from challenging 
weekly print schedules. 
Additionally, the transformation and rebuild of B2C assets was 
realised with the disposal of non-core B2C Home Interest Segment 
for a headline price of £32m. This now allows the Group to be 
focused purely on B2B. The funds from Home Interest also enabled 
the acquisition of MarketMakers, a complementary B2B marketing 
services business. 
The MarketMakers acquisition is a further step towards providing 
customers with capability and innovation that helps them to 
accelerate their business growth performance. 
MarketMakers is a new business and lead generation outsourcing 
solution for clients wanting to grow B2B revenues. It offers a rich 
array of marketing services including: market segmentation; data 
analytics; data base enrichment; automated lead generation and 
B2B telemarketing.
Now fully integrated, MarketMakers will begin to work with Centaur 
to accelerate the growth of its digital subscription products and it 
has launched a pilot to improve the ROI for exhibitors by reducing 
lead generation wastage at events.

Centaur Media Plc Annual Report and Financial Statements for the year ended 31 December 2017
PERFORMANCE:
CEO Review
Overview of 2017 
It has been an important year for Centaur Media as we continued 
our transformation to becoming one of the UK’s leading B2B 
business information groups. We have invested in priority digital 
platforms, identified operational improvements and efficiencies 
and reshaped the portfolio through two strategically important 
transactions. 
The quality of revenue continues to improve, with a further increase 
in the percentage of recurring repeat revenues combined with a 
further reduction of exposure to print advertising, which remains 
in structural decline. This places Centaur Media on far stronger 
foundations for long-term growth and value generation. 
Recurring revenues now represent 44% of total revenues with 
underlying
1
 digital premium content and exhibition revenues 28% 
and 19% respectively. This healthily compares to 2014 when  
print and total advertising represented 24% and 31% of Group 
revenue respectively. 
The improvement in revenue mix reflects the successful execution  
of our business strategy with digital products and services that 
advise, inform and connect business professionals through insight, 
data and events. 
We are particularly pleased to have delivered an improved 
operational performance. This is reflected in adjusted operating 
profit
2
 of £6.6m. 
Overall, the underlying momentum of Centaur Media is encouraging, 
and the Board is confident in the long-term prospects of the Group.
Transformation of Centaur Media 
Four years ago, Centaur set off on a strategy to create a Group that 
could take advantage of the editorial expertise and connections 
of its publishing brands and simultaneously move away from the 
reliance on tactical trade advertising. By focusing on clients’ needs 
and challenges, we invested in building valuable content sources 
that our professional communities would be prepared to buy and 
subscribe to, in order to improve their business competitiveness. 
Throughout this period of change, the structural decline in  
print advertising has been well publicised, impacting our legacy  
print businesses. 
Against this background, we have maximised the contribution from 
these highly profitable advertising revenues, reinvesting the profits to 
both grow the reshaped Group and support the dividend policy.
2017 proved the year we were able to start to take advantage of the 
hard endeavours that began in 2014. 
Key highlights include:
• Our task to transform the Home Interest portfolio into a strong, 
competitive business was completed with the disposal of this 
non-core B2C Home Interest segment for a total consideration 
of £32.8m This enabled us to focus purely on B2B and acquire 
MarketMakers for an initial consideration of £13.3m excluding 
working capital. MarketMakers is now integrated, significantly 
enhancing our service to professional marketers. 
• Our success in building digital content products such as The 
Lawyer and events such as Festival of Marketing and Business 
Travel Show allowed us to exit challenging weekly print schedules 
– radically reducing the number of issues produced each year 
from over 300 to less than 75 and reducing our ongoing total print 
exposure to less than 10%. We are now in control of our print 
business and what we want from it.
• We addressed a significant number of finance process 
issues as the business changed its ways of working. This 
materially strengthened several aspects of the Group’s financial 
management whilst improving working capital and cash flow. 
Debtor days were reduced from 77 to 52 and cash conversion in 
2017 was 138% (2016: 133%).
“ We have successfully reshaped the portfolio, 
improved the long-term quality of our revenues 
and reduced our exposure to advertising. We 
are now a business information group with a 
strategy that continues to leverage our audience 
and increase our importance to customers.”

STRATEGIC REPORT
• We created a less complicated, more focused and nimble 
business as a result of strategic action taken in print and the 
B2C disposal. This has led to management identifying internal 
efficiencies which are being realised. Central overheads were 
reduced by £1.7m in 2017. 
In short, Centaur Media is now converting audiences to customers 
and consolidating around its strongest brands. The investment into 
new content sources is building new revenues of a higher quality 
and replacing declining advertising revenues. 
We have become a unique B2B group. We can offer our clients 
end-to-end solutions that combine the strengths of our publishing 
brands’ deep market knowledge with best-in-class business 
consultancy services. We have trusted brands and capabilities 
providing effective solutions for clients searching for information and 
insightful guidance. 
The Group is well placed for growth having strengthened its 
competitiveness, created products and services to meet customer 
demand and built capabilities to unlock its future growth. 
In respect of our three market segments, 86% of Group revenues 
are weighted towards the Marketing and Professional services 
segments with Financial services accounting for the remainder.
Strengthened balance sheet
The completion of the disposal of our Home Interest segment, 
combined with strong cash generation, has significantly 
strengthened our balance sheet. We now have net cash,  
with £25m of untapped credit facilities with which to make  
strategic acquisitions.
Dividend
In light of this performance, the Board is recommending a final 
dividend of 1.5p per share, to give a total dividend for the year of 
3.0p per share.
Positive outlook
Although advertising market conditions remain challenging, they 
represent a decreasing share of Group revenue. 
The Group has made a positive start to 2018 and we remain 
confident that our strategy to invest in digital products and services 
which advise, inform and connect business professionals through 
insight, data and events, will continue to deliver long-term value for 
our clients and shareholders. 
We intend to grow both organically and through acquisition. Organic 
growth is forecast to come from improving customer lifetime value, 
cross-selling and international scalability of digital intelligence 
products. As well as improving profits from our consultancy and 
advisory business, we anticipate further growth following the 
acquisition of MarketMakers, which has already started to positively 
impact our client offering and internal capabilities. 
Segment review
Marketing
This segment includes all the Group’s brands that serve marketing 
and creative professionals including Econsultancy, Marketing Week, 
Festival of Marketing, Celebrity Intelligence, Fashion & Beauty 
Monitor, Design Week, Creative Review, Oystercatchers and 
Centaur’s most recent acquisition, MarketMakers.
The portfolio now represents 56% of the Group’s revenue. It is the 
strongest example of our Group strategy to continue to deliver long-
term value for our clients and shareholders by investment in digital 
products and services.
Marketing Week, alongside Creative Review and Design Week, 
accelerated its move away from print-based revenues in 2017 with 
a digital first, content-led strategy. Unlike 2016, these brands all 
suffered from double-digit decline in traditional advertising revenue 
and recruitment streams as clients throughout the year reduced their 
advertising spend. 
The opportunity now exists for our teams to offer broader horizontal 
client solutions – a key area of development for Centaur’s next 
phase of growth, helping us to further reduce exposure to 
volatile advertising streams by building higher value, longer term 
relationships with clients. 
Our focus on fewer, larger events has worked well with growth in 
profits for both Marketing Week Live and Festival of Marketing. The 
Festival, staged in October 2017, received positive reviews from 
delegates and commercial partners alike. Of particular note was 
the 37% growth in delegate revenues. With over 300 speakers and 
more than 200 hours of content, it is clear that marketers value the 
Festival’s content and are attending in increasing numbers to learn 
and network. Notable speakers included Stephen Fry, Mark Ritson 
and Jo Malone. Customer satisfaction scores (NPS) have increased 
year-on-year, firmly establishing the Festival as a leading global 
event. We’re delighted to see it continue to grow as the only global 
event in the sector where brand marketers comprise over 60% of 
its customer base compared with competitors such as Festival of 
Media and Advertising Week with 10-15%.
Marketing Week’s successful Mini MBA in Marketing underpinned 
the development of a Centaur-wide online classroom platform 
which successfully launched a series of modern-day micro learning 
modules and online classrooms for Econsultancy, Celebrity 
Intelligence and The Lawyer. 
Recognising the loyal and highly valuable audiences drawn together 
collectively through our three heritage publishing brands Marketing 
Week, Creative Review and Design Week, we are beginning to 
leverage their market influence as online digital ‘windows’. It is 
through these shop windows that we expect readers to access and 
purchase additional branded content such as market reports and 
training courses from Econsultancy and other affiliate partners. This 
pilot will continue to be monitored throughout 2018.

Centaur Media Plc Annual Report and Financial Statements for the year ended 31 December 2017
PERFORMANCE:
CEO Review
2017 was a pivotal year for Oystercatchers as it integrated into 
Centaur and built a fresh new proposition combining the best of two 
worlds – Oystercatchers’ unique pitch model, consultancy, training 
and Club, alongside the expert content and events of Centaur 
brands such as Econsultancy and Festival of Marketing. 
The team had success in broadening their remit with clients such 
as EY and Samsung. It onboarded exciting new clients including 
Formula One and Centrica and brought new processes and 
transformational change to the Post Office and Bwin.
As a result of client success, the Financial Times acknowledged 
Oystercatchers as one of the UK’s leading management 
consultancies and awarded the brand four out of six stars in the 
marketing, brand and pricing category alongside AT Kearney, 
Capgemini and LEK Consulting. 
Both Econsultancy and Oystercatchers suffered from a decline in 
face to face training in the second half of the year. However, given 
market demand for Elearning and growth potential, Oystercatchers’ 
training team has been consolidated within Econsultancy creating a 
combined force to deliver digital excellence. In tandem, this internal 
move allows Oystercatchers to focus on its core consultancy 
services and help the wider Centaur Group improve horizontality and 
deliver end-to-end valuable solutions for clients. 
Meanwhile, Econsultancy’s sponsored research division recorded a 
strong year-on-year performance with key projects completed with 
global innovation and technology clients including Microsoft, Google, 
Adobe and LinkedIn.
Having entered 2017 with challenging underlying business trends for 
Econsultancy, Celebrity Intelligence and Fashion & Beauty Monitor 
digital products, we exited the year with a positive upswing. 
The marketing tech and digital product landscape has become 
increasingly competitive with many new entrants taking advantage 
of new cloud technologies leading to lower barriers to entry for 
learning and advisory products. As a result, driving our digital 
product development upgrades became a key focus for 2017 and 
will remain important throughout 2018. 
Along with Celebrity Intelligence and Fashion & Beauty Monitor, 
Econsultancy’s digital product offering will be upgraded to provide 
a more competitive ‘essential marketing learning tool’. With the 
product scope now well defined, dedicated Product Managers are 
building new customer-led product features and functionality which 
will be released throughout H2 2018. 
In 2017, Fashion & Beauty Monitor and Celebrity Intelligence 
benefited from the first overhaul of technical product upgrades 
and have introduced new social media analytics, market insight 
and research reports to their product suite. The Profile Group’s 
2017 technology roadmap involved both customer-facing front end 
development and back end capability infrastructure. 
The incorporation of machine learning and real-time data feeds 
is enabling greater automation across these digital subscription 
products and will deliver further cost reduction. During 2018, an 
expanded suite of e-learning products and advisory services, 
combined with the technical content and UX upgrades, will re-
establish our competitive brand USPs and help to build yield and 
new business. 
MarketMakers, our latest acquisition, is a B2B new business 
powerhouse. It offers creative services, data analytics, lead 
generation, marketing automation and telemarketing. The acquisition 
has enabled Centaur to deploy best practice telemarketing 
capabilities at scale and better leverage data insight. It has also 
created a base from which to exploit growing market demand for 
integrated, automated marketing and intelligence services. 
As we enter 2018 Centaur is trialling an outsourcing of subscription 
new business sales to MarketMakers to take advantage of its 
marketing automation technology and efficient, operational 
telemarketing infrastructure.
We anticipate a good year’s performance as remaining product 
upgrades are completed and the enhanced commercial capability of 
MarketMakers begins to connect.
Overall the Marketing segment continues to make progress. It is 
developing a robust operational infrastructure for scalable and 
sustainable growth coupled with deepening client relationships 
allowing Centaur to advise, inform and connect business 
professionals and sell multiple products across multiple brands.

There was positive momentum across both digital premium 
content billings and live events revenues offset by a 26% decline in 
advertising revenues. Around 35% of this segment’s revenues are 
derived from premium content, with 34% from live events, 18% from 
capability services and 13% from advertising. 
The decline in adjusted operating profits
2
 and margin reflect the 
impact of weaker advertising revenues and an increase in centrally 
allocated overheads following the disposal of the Home Interest 
segment. Reported operating profits were impacted by earn-out 
charges relating to the Oystercatchers acquisition of £0.6m (2016: 
£0.6m) and acquisition costs relating to MarketMakers of £0.6m.
Outlook: this segment is expected to exhibit steady growth into 
2018 driven by recurring digital premium content revenues and 
integration with MarketMakers.
Professional services
The Professional services segment includes two subsidiary markets: 
The Lawyer and Exhibitions. Around 60% of revenue comes from 
live events, 30% advertising and 10% premium content. 
Our exhibitions include Subcon, an exhibition that serves the sub-
contractor industry, Employee Benefits Live, Business Travel Show 
and The Meetings Show.
2017 was a significant year for the portfolio as we reduced our 
exposure to print revenue with the closure of the bi-monthly MWP 
in the engineering space and the move from weekly to monthly 
editions for The Lawyer and Employee Benefits which moved to 
digital only distribution.
The Lawyer 
The Lawyer is a multi-platform intelligence brand with digital 
subscriptions, live event and digital advertising revenue streams. 
Its content strategy continued to progress successfully. Premium 
content now represents 38% (including Clean Energy Pipeline)
of total revenue with over 160 large law firms taking up enterprise 
subscription licences. 
As we move into 2018, a new website is being developed to allow 
paying users to link seamlessly to The Lawyer’s exclusive data 
tables and deal information whilst providing access to market 
insight reports. By linking news, analysis, data and insight in 
one digital platform, The Lawyer is evolving as a market-leading 
digital information service. It has successfully moved away from 
30 years as a weekly print magazine to a monthly analytical 
and features driven magazine with themed issues, reports and 
customer interviews. In recognition of this strategy and successful 
execution, The Lawyer landed the prestigious Periodical Publishers 
Association’s Media Brand of the Year Award in 2017. 
The Lawyer Market Reports continued to deliver reliable revenue 
streams with the UK 200 series generating 9% growth year-on-year. 
Availability of all 17 reports on the new portal in 2018 should enable 
additional opportunities for dedicated account management teams 
to cross-sell subscriptions, data services and reports. 
Exhibitions
Collectively, Exhibitions performed well with underlying
1
 revenue 
growth of 6% on a reported basis as a result of the disposal of 
the Home Interest segment driven largely by the Business Travel 
Show at London’s Olympia Exhibition Centre. In 2017 the event 
hosted over 375 exhibitors, 425 hosted buyers and 7,000 visitors. 
Meanwhile, The Meetings Show continued to develop well with 
strong margin growth of 8% on revenue growth of 14% year-on-
year. Subcon performed well too with 25% visitor growth and 
strong underlying
1
 profit growth of 22%, helped by an increase 
in international exhibitors, and new on-site content and learning 
programmes. 
The Engineer’s focus has been to drive its online audience. Monthly 
page views have grown, with unique visitors up 4% year-on-year. 
Good progress was also made by developing brand-led events. 
‘Collaborate to Innovate’, a unique awards/conference event in its 
sector, launched well with Vince Cable as a keynote speaker.

Legal revenues were 2% below last year, reflecting weaker 
recruitment advertising which were partially offset by good growth in 
premium content revenues. Deferred revenues in the Legal portfolio 
were £1.1m at 31 December 2017, compared to £0.9m at the same 
time last year. The adjusted
2
 operating margin has increased from 
4.5% to 8.9%.
Outlook: The Lawyer and the Exhibition brands, particularly the 
Business Travel Show and Employee Benefits Live are all expected 
to add to the Group’s recurring revenue streams through growing 
exhibition and digital subscription revenues.
Financial services
This year saw a significant move away from traditional print 
platforms with Mortgage Strategy moving from weekly to monthly, 
Fund Strategy moving to digital only and the sale of Corporate 
Adviser. Money Marketing remains in weekly print but with reduced 
frequency during the year. The portfolio also includes subscription 
services Platforum, Taxbriefs and Headline Money.
Platforum continued to build on its reputation as a key reference 
point for asset managers, life companies and platforms on retail 
investment distribution. It is now firmly established as a subscription 
product with renewal rates of 85% by value and a series of  
growing events. 
Beyond Platforum, the Financial Services segment continues to offer 
targeted events for all sectors of the financial services community 
including large scale conferences, awards and exclusive invitation-
only summits for industry leaders. As a portfolio we are deliberately 
selective in our events – opting to support larger scale, repeatable 
events across big brands. Commercial packages are sold across the 
brands to enable cross-media solutions for sponsors and clients.

This segment’s revenues remain reliant on advertising, at 39% of 
the revenue mix, with 37% from premium content and 24% from 
live events. Reflecting the wider economic environment, advertising 
declined by 18% year-on-year, partly due to the move away from 
high frequency print. The second half of 2017 saw performance 
improve significantly. Supporting this is the move to digitally-led 
creative solutions for clients which is gaining traction as we move 
into 2018. 
The operating loss of £7.0m in 2016 was driven by an impairment of 
£7.2m. No impairment has been booked this year.
Outlook: despite the weakness reported in the first half of 2017, 
Financial services has strong brands, premium content and an 
increasingly agile digital delivery platform.

STRATEGIC REPORT
People 
Changes to the senior management team in 2016 have settled 
well and the diverse skills and experience that each Executive 
Committee member brings has allowed the Group to deliver 
significant operational success in 2017.
Whilst continuing to focus on immediate business delivery, the 
Executive Committee is keen to develop a culture that works 
horizontally together to deliver client solutions that advise, inform 
and connect. Our internal training plans are being developed to 
support this ambition. 
Our approach to diversity continues to be proactive through policies 
and working practices. Our male to female ratio is well balanced 
and we retain strong representation of women at a senior level. 
Two out of six (33%) of our Board members are female, and four 
out of six (66%) of our Executive Committee are female. Our family 
friendly policies include enhanced maternity and paternity leave, 
flexible work options, while our return rate of maternity leavers is in 
excess of 90%. A high percentage of staff, both male and female, 
work flexible/reduced hours including our COO, Company Secretary, 
an Oystercatchers Managing Partner, Group Head of HR and a 
Research Director. Two staff made use of shared parental leave 
during 2017.
We are delighted to see our Development Board, comprising some 
of our rising stars, continue to grow from strength to strength. The 
Development Board’s remit is ‘to change Centaur for good’ and 
act as a communications channel between our people and the 
senior leadership. Sponsored last year by Suki Thompson, the 
Development Board now leads our internal charity sponsorship 
activity and has planned and delivered new initiatives including 
a recognition scheme, football and softball teams, regular yoga, 
mindfulness and meditation sessions, lunch and learns, and last 
but not least, a Bike Clinic and Cycle Safety session to encourage 
people to cycle to work.
Through the Apprenticeship Levy we are supporting a number 
of staff to achieve professional qualifications in Management and 
Leadership, Digital Marketing and Data Analysis.
During the year we had many successes with The Lawyer 
winning the blue ribbon PPA Business Media Brand of the Year, 
Econsultancy winning Best technology partner for Marketing Week 
Mini MBA at the AOP Awards and Marketing Week winning ‘Digital 
Brand of the Year’.
Summary
We will continue to enforce our customer focus, enhance our 
products, and, simplify our operating structure.
Our investment into digital products and our improved overall 
revenue mix will enhance performance going forward and we remain 
confident that our strategy is building long-term value for  
our shareholders. 
These results and achievements would not have been possible 
without the full commitment and energy of every Centaurion. I am 
continuously impressed by the expertise of my colleagues across 
the Group. The levels of passion and deep knowledge of our 
content specialists and their commitment to innovate our products 
and services have been critical to enable such radical product 
transformations across the Group.
The ongoing success of Centaur relies on the ideas, the energy and 
our determination to deliver valuable solutions for our customers. 
Thank you to every Centaurion, to our shareholders, our readers 
and our customers. We look forward to continuing our work and 
providing valuable solutions throughout 2018.

Centaur Media Plc Annual Report and Financial Statements for the year ended 31 December 2017
PERFORMANCE:
CFO Review
Overview
The results of the business are presented in accordance with 
accounting standards.
Due to the disposal of the Home Interest segment in August 2017, 
we are required to disclose the turnover and operating profit on 
a continuing operations basis which includes MarketMakers post 
acquisition and excludes the Home Interest segment. The net result 
of the Home Interest segment is disclosed separately on the face 
of the Income Statement as ‘Profit for the period from discontinued 
operations’. Revenue, net operating expenses, finance and taxation 
costs reported on the face of the Income Statement therefore only 
refer to that achieved by our Marketing, Professional and Financial 
services segments.
On a continuing operations basis revenue was £65.4m (2016: 
£59.7m) in the year. However, when considering Group 
performance, we believe it more appropriate to consider total 
revenue and adjusted operating profit
2 
generated over the year. 
Therefore, we have chosen to focus on revenue including the 
Home Interest segment until disposal and MarketMakers from 
acquisition. On this basis revenue was £72.6m (2016: £72.5m). 
Adjusted operating profit
2
 (including MarketMakers from acquisition) 
was £4.1m. The adjusted operating profit
2
 for the period for Home 
Interest was £2.5m. On the face of the income statement we report 
£2.1m of net operating profit for Home Interest which includes 
£0.4m of tax. Therefore, the adjusted operating profit
2
 is £6.6m 
(2016: £9.1m); adjusted
2
 operating margin is 9.1% (2016: 12.6%).
Non-statutory measures
In these results we refer to ‘adjusted’ and ‘statutory’ results, as well 
as other non-GAAP performance measures. Adjusted
2
 results are 
prepared to provide a more comparable indication of the Group’s 
core business performance by removing the impact of certain items 
including exceptional items (material and non-recurring), and volatile 
items predominantly relating to investment activities and other 
separately reported items. Adjusted
2
 results exclude adjusting items 
as set out in the statement of consolidated income and below, with 
further details given in notes 1(b) and 4 of the financial statements. 
In addition, the Group also measures and presents performance in 
relation to various other non-GAAP measures, such as underlying
1
 
revenue growth, adjusted operating cash flow
3
, adjusted
2
 EBITDA 
and net debt
5
.
Adjusted
2
 results are not intended to replace statutory results.  
These have been presented to provide users with additional 
information and analysis of the Group’s performance, consistent with 
how the Board monitors results. Further rationale for each of the 
adjusting items used in these measures, as well as reconciliations  
to their statutory equivalents, can be found in note 1(b) to the 
financial statements.
The Group’s activities are predominantly UK-based and therefore 
currency movements do not have a material impact on the  
Group’s results.

STRATEGIC REPORT
Summary
Commentary on revenues and operating results is set out within the 
CEO’s Review. 
2017 represented a year of significant change for Centaur with the 
disposal of our Home Interest segment completing our strategic 
shift to a pure B2B player. We also completed the acquisition of 
MarketMakers, which has significantly extended the business’s lead 
generation capability and will help further shift our revenue mix to a 
more predictable cashflow than that offered by the Home Interest 
segment, whilst also going some way to reducing the complexity of 
the business.
We are very pleased with the performance of MarketMakers since 
its acquisition and we see it as a key vehicle to drive growth in other 
parts of our business. 
The key underlying trend within the business during the year was 
the continued decline of advertising revenue (21% of total 2017 
revenue, a reduction from 28% in 2016) with its high drop through 
to profit. Combined with the acquisition of MarketMakers this has 
assisted Centaur in increasing recurring revenue from 36% in 2016 
to 44% in 2017.
The Group is pleased to report year end net cash of £4.1m against 
a net debt
5
 position of £14.1m at the end of December 2016. The 
rate of cash conversion
4
 was 138% (2016: 133%). The £18.2m 
improvement in cash is driven not only by the net proceeds of the 
Home Interest segment disposal but also active working capital 
management, including stringent controls over cash management 
and its collection.
In 2016, reflecting a reduced growth outlook in the Financial 
services segment, the Group recognised a non-cash impairment 
charge of £7.2m against goodwill. An annual impairment review 
has been carried out in 2017 and we are pleased to report a nil 
impairment charge.
Revenues
Revenues in 2017 were £72.6m including the Home Interest 
segment (2016: £72.5m). On a continuing operations basis revenue 
was £65.4m (2016: £59.7m). Underlying
1
 trends, adjusting for 
the biennial show, AMS, the acquisitions of MarketMakers and 
Oystercatchers, and the disposal of the Home Interest segment, 
show a decline of 6% primarily due to the continued decline of 
advertising. The acquisition of MarketMakers, which is excluded 
from underlying
1
, recorded £13.9m of revenue in 2017 on a full 
year basis. The Group’s results for 2017 include five months’ 
consolidated MarketMakers’ revenue. Further information on the 
divisional revenue performance and the mix of revenues across 
premium content, live events and advertising is included in the  
CEO’s Review. 
Operating profit

 of 9.1% (2016: 12.6%). Excluding the Home Interest 
Segment and as reported on the face of the Income Statement,

Centaur Media Plc Annual Report and Financial Statements for the year ended 31 December 2017
PERFORMANCE:
CFO Review
Adjusting items
The Directors believe that adjusted
2
 results and adjusted
2
 earnings 
per share provide additional useful information on the core 
operational performance of the Group to shareholders, and review 
the results of the Group on an adjusted
2
 basis internally. Details 
of the Group’s accounting policy in relation to adjusting items are 
shown in note 1(b) to the financial statements. 
Adjusting items generated a loss before tax of (£4.4m) (2016: 
(£12.6m)). In 2016, an impairment charge of £7.2m was recognised 
in the Financial services segment.
Exceptional operating costs of £4.4m (2016: £12.6m) include staff-
related restructuring costs of £0.2m (2016: £0.9m) which principally 
relate to the reorganisation of the business as the Group reduces its 
exposure to print. Whilst similar costs have been incurred previously 
whilst performing other restructuring actions, such costs linked to the 
substantial reduction of print as part of the Group’s transformation 
programme are not expected to recur once this is completed, and as 
such these are deemed to be exceptional in nature.
In the year no separately reported charge for the impairment of trade 
receivables has been made (2016: £1.5m). Cash collection has 
performed strongly in the year following the improvements made to 
front-end billing and credit control processes in 2017. At the end of 
2017, Group DSO stood at 52 days, a reduction of 25 days from 
the end of 2016. This, in addition to the net cash receipts from 
the disposal of the Home Interest segment, has driven the Group 
reporting a net cash position at the end of 2017 of £4.1m (2016: net 
debt
5
 of £14.1m), an improvement of £18.2m.
Earn-out costs of £0.6m (2016: £0.6m) relate to the earn-out 
arrangement on the acquisition of Oystercatchers, which are treated 
as a remuneration expense through the statement of comprehensive 
income until the end of the earnout period. 
Other adjusting items include amortisation of acquired intangible 
assets of £2.5m (2016: £2.2m) and a share-based payment charge 
of £0.5m (2016: credit of (£0.1m)). 
Further analysis on these adjusting items is included in the  
Basis of Preparation section of note 1(b) and note 4 to the financial 
statements.  
Net finance costs
Adjusted
2
 net finance costs were £0.4m (2016: £0.5m). The 
reduction in finance costs reflects lower net debt
5
 during 2017 
compared to 2016. 
Taxation 
A tax charge of £0.4m (2016: £0.1m) has been recognised on 
continuing operations for the year. The adjusted tax charge 
was £0.9m (2016: £0.8m) giving an adjusted effective tax rate 
(compared to adjusted
2
 profit before tax) of 25.3% (2016: 21.9%). 
The Company’s profits were taxed in the UK at a blended rate of 
19.25% (2016: 20%), with the fall in the main rate of UK Corporation 
tax being offset by the impact of overseas earnings taxed at higher 
rates. On a reported basis, the effective tax rate of 50.5% (2016: 
(1.4)%) is driven by a small loss relative to the non-deductible 
acquisition costs in the year and other non-deductible expenses. 
See note 7 for a reconciliation between the statutory and reported 
tax charge.
Share-based payments 
Share-based payments charges in 2017 approached their historical 
level of £0.5m following a credit of £0.1m in 2016, as a result of 
lapses in the LTIP schemes following changes in senior management 
and performance under non-market performance conditions.
Earnings per share
The Group has delivered adjusted
2
 diluted earnings per share for the 
year of 3.2p (2016: 4.5p). Losses per share for the year were (14.3)p 
(2016: (3.8)p). Full details of the earnings per share calculations can 
be found in note 9 to the financial statements.
Dividend
An interim dividend of 1.5p per share was paid in respect of the 
period January to June 2017 (January to June 2016: 1.5p). A final 
dividend in respect of the period July to December 2017 of 1.5p per 
share (July to December 2016: 1.5p) is proposed by the Directors, 
giving a total dividend for the year ended 31 December 2017 of 3.0p 
(2016: 3.0p), in line with 2016.
The final dividend in respect of the year is subject to shareholder 
approval at the Annual General Meeting and, if approved, will be 
paid on 25 May 2018 to all ordinary shareholders on the register at 
close of business on 11 May 2018.
Adjusted dividend cover in the year was 1.2 times (2016: 1.6 times).
Cash flow 
As set out below, the Group has now eliminated net debt
5
 with net 
cash of £4.1m at the of 2017 compared to net debt of £14.1m at 
the end of 2016. The rate of cash conversion
4
 was even stronger 
than 2016 at 138% (2016: 133%).

 is not a measure defined by IFRS. 
Centaur defines adjusted operating cashflow

 as cash flow from 
operations excluding the impact of adjusting items, which are defined 
above. The Directors use this measure to assess the performance of 
the Group as it excludes volatile items not related to the core trading 
of the Group, and includes the Group’s management of capital 
expenditure. A reconciliation between cash flow from operations and 
adjusted operating cash flow
3
 is shown in note 1(b) to the financial 
statements. The cash impact of adjusting items primarily relates to 
exceptional restructuring costs in both years. 
Acquisitions net of disposals generated a cash inflow of £13.5m in 
the year (2016: cash outflow of £1.5m).
Financing and bank covenants
On 8 June 2015, the Group agreed a four year £25m multi-currency 
revolving credit facility, provided by RBS and Lloyds. This facility 
runs to 31 August 2019. The principal financial covenants under 
the facility are: the ratio of net debt
5
 to adjusted EBITDA
2
 shall 
not exceed 2.5:1, and the ratio of EBITDA to net finance charges 
shall not be less than 4:1. The Group remained within its banking 
covenants during the year and has currently not drawn down any of 
its £25m banking facilities. 
Disposal of the Home Interest segment
On 1 August 2017, we successfully completed the disposal of the 
Home Interest segment for consideration of £32.8m allowing the 
Group to strategically focus on B2B. This disposal has resulted in a 
profit on disposal of £20.9m with the funds being partially invested 
in the acquisition of MarketMakers. 
Acquisition of MarketMakers
On 2 August 2017 the Group completed the acquisition of 100%  
of the shares in MarketMakers for a total purchase price of £18.9m, 
subject to meeting earn-out targets. Initial net consideration was 
£16.5m with a further balance due upon successful achievement of 
earn-out targets. We are pleased that MarketMakers has performed 
strongly in 2017 and significantly added value to the Group in 2017. 
We are actively investigating ways in which MarketMakers’ inherent 
competitive advantage in lead generation can drive future growth 
across Centaur as a whole.
Balance sheet 
A summary of the Group’s balance sheet as at 31 December 2017 
and 2016 is set out below: 
 
2017
£m
 2016
£m
Goodwill and other intangible assets 94.2 88.8

5
80.8 81.2
Net cash/(debt)
5
4.1 (14.1)
Net assets 84.9 67.1
The main movement in the Group’s balance sheet is an increase of 
£5.4m in goodwill and other intangible assets, primarily caused by 
the acquisition of MarketMakers and partially offset by the disposal 
of the Home Interest segment. Deferred income has fallen primarily 
due to the disposal of the Home Interest segment. Other current 
assets and liabilities have fallen due to the continual improvement in 
collection of trade debtors during the year, combined with a 2017 
provision for earn-out payments due to MarketMakers. Net cash has 
improved £18.2m due to improved working capital management 
combined with the net proceeds of the disposal of the Home 
Interest segment less monies reinvested into the MarketMakers 
acquisition. Further details on these significant movements can be 
found throughout this report.
Conclusion
2017 has been a transformative period in the Group as it moves 
towards its goal of advising, informing and connecting. The disposal 
of the Home Interest Segment has realised our strategic goal of 
becoming a pure play business information group whilst reducing its 
complexity. The disposal of the Home Interest segment for £32.8m 
not only eliminated the Group’s net debt
5
 position but also funded 
the acquisition of MarketMakers, an exciting driver of future growth. I 
am delighted to see our revenue mix move towards higher recurring 
revenues and replacing declining advertising revenues. 
The Group remains cash generative and is in a strong position to 
move quickly to make further strategic acquisitions with synergy 
opportunities. I am delighted that our working capital position has 
continued to improve during 2017 with days’ sales outstanding 
(DSO) having improved by 25 days over the year. Although we will 
never become complacent, our investors can be assured that debt 
collection and cash management is now well controlled and timely.
We are now well placed to build upon the positive financial and 
operational performance of 2017 and continue the transformation of 
the business in the coming year.

Centaur Media Plc Annual Report and Financial Statements for the year ended 31 December 2017
Risk management approach
The Board has overall responsibility for the effectiveness of the 
Group’s system of risk management and internal controls and these 
are regularly monitored by the Audit Committee.
Details of the activities of the Audit Committee in this financial year 
can be found in the Audit Committee Report on pages 37 to 40.
The Executive Committee is responsible for identifying, managing 
and monitoring material risks in each area of the business and for 
regularly reviewing and updating the risk register, as well as reporting 
to the Audit Committee in relation to risks, mitigations and controls. 
As the Group operates principally from one office and with relatively 
short management reporting lines, members of the Executive 
Committee are closely involved in day-to-day matters and able to 
identify areas of increasing risk quickly and respond accordingly. 
The responsibility for each risk identified is assigned to a member 
of the Executive Committee. The Audit Committee considers 
risk management and controls regularly and the Board formally 
considers risks to the Group’s strategy and plans as well as the risk 
management process as part of its strategic review.
The risk register is the core element of the Group’s risk management 
process. The register is maintained by the Company Secretary with 
input from the Executive Committee. The Executive Committee 
initially identifies the material risks facing the Group and then 
collectively assesses the severity of each risk (by ranking both the 
likelihood of occurrence of the risk and its potential impact on the 
business) and the related mitigating controls. 
As part of its risk management processes, the Board considers 
both strategic and operational risks, as well as its risk appetite in 
terms of the tolerance level it is willing to accept in relation to each 
principal risk, which is recorded in the Company’s risk register. This 
approach recognises that risk cannot always be eliminated at an 
acceptable cost and that there are some risks which the Board will, 
after due and careful consideration, choose to accept. The Group’s 
risk register, its method of preparation and the operation of the 
key controls in the Group’s system of internal control are regularly 
reviewed and overseen by the Audit Committee with reference to the 
Group’s strategic aims and its operating environment. The register is 
also reviewed and considered by the Board.
As part of the ongoing enhancement of the Group’s risk monitoring 
activities, we reviewed and updated the procedures by which we 
evaluate principal risks and uncertainties during the year. 
 
Principal risks 
The Group’s risk register currently includes operational and strategic 
risks. The principal risks faced by the Group in 2017, taken from the 
register, together with the potential effects and mitigating factors, are 
set out below. The Directors confirm that they have undertaken a 
robust assessment of the principal risks facing the Group. Financial 
risks are shown in note 29 to the financial statements.

breach of data protection requirements or direct 
financial impact. See The General Data Protection 
Regulation (‘GDPR’) below. 
• Centaur collects and processes personal data

customers, users and other third parties. Centaur 
is at risk from a serious occurrence of a loss, 
theft or misuse of personal data or confidential 
information on our software/hardware due to the 
actions of a Centaur employee, partner or third 
party. See also GDPR below.
• Appropriate IT security is undertaken for all key 
processes to keep the IT environment safe. 
• Websites are hosted by specialist third-party 
providers who provide warranties relating to 
security standards. 
• All of our websites have been migrated onto a new

during 2015, 2016 and ongoing in 2017.
• External access to data is protected and staff are 
instructed to password protect or encrypt where 
appropriate. 
• The Director of Data and Analytics ensures that 
rigorous controls are in place to ensure that 
warehouse data can only be downloaded by the 
data team. Integration of the warehouse with 
current databases and data captured and stored 
elsewhere is ongoing. 
• Centaur has a business continuity plan which 
includes its IT systems and there is daily, overnight

Stricter requirements regarding 
how Centaur handles personal 
data, including that of 
customers and the risk of a fine 
from the ICO, third party claims 
(e.g. from customers) as well as 
reputational damage if we do 
not comply.
• The General Data Protection Regulation (‘GDPR’), 
which is the new data protection law coming 
into force in May 2018, involves much stricter 
requirements for Centaur regarding its handling of 
personal data.
This includes:
• customers having greater rights on how we use 
their data
• Centaur having to provide specific information to 
our customers on how we use their data
• new rules around how we obtain customers’ 
consent to being contacted 
• personal data being kept more securely; time and 
access
• new contracts being put in place between us and 
suppliers that handle our data 
• new rules about notifying the ICO in the event of a 
breach of GDPR 
• a shorter time period for responding to “subject 
access requests“ from customers
• a requirement to demonstrate how we comply 
with GDPR, which means we need to improve our 
internal record-keeping, etc.
• in the event of a serious breach of the GDPR, 
Centaur could be subject to a significant fine 
from the regulator (the ICO) and claims from third 
parties including customers as well as reputational 
damage.
• a new maximum fine for breach of GDPR is much 
higher than the current maximum fine applicable 
under current UK data protection legislation. 
• Centaur has engaged Wiggin LLP to provide legal 
advice on what changes we are required to make 
in order to comply with GDPR. The measures we 
are taking include:
 − updating the ‘consent’ wording on our 
websites and event registration pages to 
ensure language is specific/ unambiguous 
 − updating our unsubscribe process
 − improving our data complaints procedures 
 − improving our procedures for removing 
individuals from databases where details are 
inaccurate/ not needed
 − updating our standard terms and conditions 
across all products
 − updating our privacy and cookies policy and 
website terms and conditions 
 − amending our contract with suppliers who 
provide us with personal data (ie lists) or who 
handle data on our behalf.

Serious systems failure 
(affecting core systems and 
multiple products or functions) 
or breach of IT network security 
(as a result of a deliberate 
cyber-attack or unintentional 
event). 
• Centaur relies on its IT network to conduct its 
operations. The IT network is at risk of a serious 
systems failure or breach of its security controls. 
This could result from deliberate cyber-attacks or 
unintentional events and may include third parties 
gaining unauthorised access to Centaur’s IT 
network and systems resulting in misappropriation 
of its financial assets, proprietary or sensitive 
information, corruption of data, or operational 
disruption, such as unavailability of our websites 
and our digital products to users or unavailability 
of support platforms. 
• If Centaur suffers further serious cyber-attacks, 
whether by a third party or insider, any operational 
disruption may directly affect our revenues or 
collection activities.
• Centaur may incur significant costs and 
suffer other negative consequences, such as 
remediation costs (including liability for stolen 
assets or information, and repair of any damage 
caused to Centaur’s IT network infrastructure and 
systems). Centaur may also suffer reputational 
damage and loss of investor confidence resulting 
from any operational disruption. 
• Centaur has invested significantly in its IT systems 
and several key IT system upgrades have taken 
place during 2017;
• the ongoing development of CRM (PCI compliance) 
and finance systems introduced in 2015.
• IT system improvements in 2017 and ongoing into 
2018, following completion of an external audit of 
the security of our main IT infrastructure carried 
out by a specialist third party provider i.e. Microsoft 
security against Ransomware attacks 
• where services are outsourced to suppliers, 
contingency planning is carried out to mitigate risk 
of supplier failure.  
• Lockton’s is advising us in relation to any additional 
cover that is appropriate to insure against a serious 
failure of IT network security controls.
• Migration of Econ to our secure platform 
Wordpress in 2018 is underway 
• we are upgrading our policies in Q1 2018 to further 
ensure our staff are clear and accountable for their 
IT compliance. 
The Board 
considers this 
risk to be broadly 
the same as for 
the prior year.

Trends in advertising and direct 
sales of our print products 
result in declining revenues 
from these sources. 
• Print advertising revenues and direct sales of our 
print products continued to decline more steeply 
during the latter part of 2016 as direct revenue 
from print products dipped more sharply than 
expected at the start of the year, and are not 
being replaced like-for-like with online or digital 
products. The non-print media sector has high 
levels of competition from a wider group and low 
barriers to entry. This leads to different pressures 
on audience and customer retention as well as 
pricing.
• This risk has increased since the 2015 reporting 
period due to volatility in advertising spend across 
our markets in the weeks leading up to and 
following the UK’s EU referendum. The uncertainty 
following the EU referendum result in specific 
markets including financial services continued 
throughout 2016 and in the first half of 2017 and 
is expected, at the very least, until firm plans for 
the UK’s exit from the EU are established by the 
UK Government.
• Our Business Plans take into account the market 
shrinkage and where appropriate print products 
are being replaced. Our strategy includes 
identifying the type of content our audiences want 
and how they want to consume the content, 
meaning that we are not simply putting print 
products online to try to replace diminishing print 
revenues for traditional brands. Centaur has been 
rapidly reducing the Company’s exposure to 
print advertising and has significantly increased 
revenues from digital paid-for content. In 2017 
we reduced print volumes by over 60% across 
the financial, legal, marketing and HR portfolios. 
This involved changes in frequency (weekly to 
monthly) and for some brands moving to digital-
only formats supported by profitable events and 
awards.
• We continue to monitor the decline in our print 
products while at the same time investing in 
developing our digital capability and ability to scale 
cross-media marketing solutions. In addition to 
a new, flexible web platform we are developing 
new revenue streams from products, such as the 
Marketing Week Mini MBA, which are exclusively 
digital and derive no revenue from print. 
• We support our product innovation, by hiring 
people with experiences and skills in new areas 
of the market where appropriate. The role of 
our Executive Committee includes anticipating 
future changes in the market and ensuring that 
our business reacts or accelerates our plans 
accordingly.
• However spend cannot be assumed to flow 
directly to replacement products and therefore 
volatility on advertising in our core sectors remain 
a risk factor.
The Board 
considers that 
our exposure 
to this risk has 
decreased 
since the prior 
year due to the 
specific actions 
we have taken 
to reduce our 
dependency on 
print advertising.

STRATEGIC REPORT
Viability statement
In accordance with provision C.2.2 of the UK Corporate Governance 
Code April 2016, the Directors have assessed the viability of the 
Group over a three-year period to December 2020, taking account 
of the Group’s current position, the Group’s strategy, the Board’s 
risk appetite and, as documented above, the principal risks facing 
the Group and how these are managed. Based on the results of 
this analysis, the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the 
Company will be able to continue in operation and meet its liabilities 
as they fall due over the period to December 2020.
The Board has determined that the three-year period to December 
2020 is an appropriate period over which to provide its viability 
statement because the Board’s financial planning horizon covers a 
three-year period. In making their assessment, the Directors have 
taken account of the Group’s existing financing arrangements 
to 2019 (and assumed that financing will be available to replace 
the current facility on similar terms), cash flows, dividend cover 
and other key financial ratios over the period. These metrics are 
subject to stress testing which involves sensitising a number of the 
main assumptions underlying the forecasts both individually and 
in unison. The assumptions sensitised include forecasted EBITDA, 
cash conversion
4
 and capital expenditure. Where appropriate, this 
analysis is carried out to evaluate the potential impact of the Group’s 
principal risks actually occurring, such as print and advertising 
revenues continuing to shrink, staff attrition, UK economic conditions 
and replication of products by competitors. Sensitising the model for 
changes in the assumptions and risks affirmed that the Group would 
remain viable over the three year period to 2020. 
Going concern basis of accounting
In accordance with provision C.1.3 of the UK Corporate 
Governance Code April 2016, the Directors’ statement as to 
whether they consider it appropriate to adopt the going concern 
basis of accounting in preparing the financial statements and their 
identification of any material uncertainties to the Group’s ability to 
continue to do so over a period of at least twelve months from the 
date of approval of the financial statements and for the foreseeable 
future can be found on page 32.

Centaur Media Plc Annual Report and Financial Statements for the year ended 31 December 2017
CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY
Our people
Talent development
Centaur Media is committed to developing a culture of 
environmental awareness and social responsibility and we seek 
where appropriate to incorporate environmentally and socially 
responsible practices into the way we deliver services and products 
to our customers and procure goods and services from third parties. 
The Group has a whistleblowing policy in place enabling employees 
to report any concerns about improper practices, including relating 
to its environmental and social responsibility practices.
Employee engagement
We have adopted a new on-line application which gives employees 
the opportunity to provide feedback on a weekly basis and enables 
management to get a regular temperature check on motivation and 
real time feedback from their teams.
Health and safety
We are committed to the safety of our staff. We have a health and 
safety policy which sets out Centaur’s responsibilities and those 
of its staff concerning health and safety in the workplace. Our 
Health and Safety Committee, which is responsible for overseeing 
the application of this Policy, meets at least every six months and 
reports directly to the Board on all material related matters. Due to 
the nature of the business, risk of work-based accidents is relatively 
low but the Group takes its responsibilities for the health and safety 
of its employees seriously. Our office manager is responsible for 
maintaining a safe environment for employees and an Accident 
Book is available to all staff in Reception. We periodically carry out 
internal health and safety reviews, taking follow up action to maintain 
standards where necessary, and undertake staff training in relation 
to fire safety. Where work-related activities take place which have a 
higher risk attached – such as travel, marketing events and outdoor 
activities – additional planning is undertaken which includes a risk 
assessment and mitigation plan. To minimise risk to the health 
and safety of our employees in the event of a major disaster or 
emergency, we have recently revised our business continuity plan 
and carried out testing of the plan.
Diversity
Centaur Media strongly encourages diversity across the Group 
and is committed to recruiting and promoting the most talented 
people from the widest pool and providing equal opportunities for 
all employees and prospective employees. To support this aim, the 
Group has an Equal Opportunities Policy which covers recruitment 
and selection, promotion, training and development and standard 
contract terms for all staff. We also support apprenticeships which 
increase our talent pool and demonstrates the Group’s commitment 
to reaching out to young people from a variety of backgrounds. We 
offer internships and work experience opportunities for people from 
a variety of backgrounds.
Last year we implemented the provisions of the UK Modern Slavery 
Act 2015 and adopted an anti-slavery and human trafficking policy.
Two out of our six (33%) Board members are female and, four 
out of six (66%) of our Executive Committee are female and, as at 
31 December 2017, our workforce overall was 50% female (397 
employees) and 50% male (394 employees). We proudly support 
flexible working opportunities, and 6% of staff are employed on a 
part-time basis. 
Gender pay
We are currently finalising our analysis for Gender Pay and will be 
submitting and publishing the outcome prior to the 2018 deadline. 
Environment
Our impact on the environment
Centaur Media operates in the media sector, predominantly in the 
United Kingdom, and consequently, while Centaur recognises that 
its business has an impact on the environment, including through 
the use of energy and paper, our impact on the environment is less 
significant than that of companies operating in many other sectors. 
As we continue to increase our digital capabilities and products, 
and to reduce our reliance on print advertising, we are reducing 
our use of consumable items such as paper and plastic over 
time. The majority of our employees work out of a single location 
in Wells Street, London and we have only one other UK location 
in Portsmouth meaning that the Group has been able to take 
advantage of consolidating building-related environmental impacts 
and benefiting from Group sharing of items such as photocopiers. 
The Group also has small offices in New York and Singapore.
The Group actively seeks to minimise adverse environmental 
impacts and to promote good environmental practices wherever 
possible. We increasingly aim to ensure that our major suppliers 
are environmentally responsible. For example, our main paper and 
print supplier holds the ISO 14001 (environmental management) 
accreditation and is certified by the Forest Stewardship Council and 
Programme for the Endorsement of Forestry Certification. 
In the last quarter we introduced Follow-Me-Printing. This will allow 
us to monitor printing across the business. 
We donate used computer equipment to Camera Education, 
which is a social enterprise dedicated to improving education in 
disadvantaged communities across the world. In 2017 we donated 
the following: 
• 30 x Zoostorm desktop PCs
• 30 x 21" iMac’s desktops PCs
• 21 x EizoFflexidesk – 21" monitor

STRATEGIC REPORT
Some of our other measures are:
• use of energy-efficient lighting, including replacing existing 
light fittings with energy efficient LED light fittings in the Wells 
Street building. During the year ended 31 December 2017, this 
programme was extended to include all common parts of the 
Wells Street building;
• installation of motion sensors in offices to control lighting;
• analysing and adjusting the timing of boilers and chillers for office 
air conditioning to increase energy efficiency;
• stopping the use of non-recyclable cups and reducing the use of 
paper hand towels;
• buying paper that is Forest Stewardship Council (‘FSC’) 
accredited which means that the paper has been sourced in an 
environmentally-friendly, socially responsible and economically 
viable manner;
• active engagement in the recycling of cans, tins, plastic, glass, 
cardboard and paper, including the replacement of traditional 
waste bins with recycling bins throughout the Wells Street building 
as part of a new centralised recycling system rolled out in 2015, 
together with a monthly report showing the percentage of waste 
collected that was recycled; 
• recycling of printer cartridges where possible;
• increasing the use of aqueous inks, which limit the release of 
volatile organic compounds; 
• use of eco-friendly taxis and courier vehicles that are less than  
3 years old, and use of cyclist couriers, where possible;
• cycle to work scheme and other measures that facilitate cycling to 
work by employees, such as the provision of showers, changing 
rooms and lockers, as well as bike storage facilities at the Wells 
Street building; and
• encouraging staff to use public transport by provision of season 
ticket loans.
Emissions
We continue to measure our carbon footprint by monitoring our 
energy usage and we are pleased to confirm that we are compliant 
with the EU Energy Efficiency Directive ‘Energy Saving Opportunity 
Scheme’ (‘ESOS’).

of £8,170, a Group contribution of £8,170 and £67,387 in third 
party contributions raised through our events) was donated to The 
Alzheimer’s Society, our chosen charity partner for 2017. In 2016, 
£118,855 (comprising employee contributions of £8,454, a Group 
contribution of £8,454 and £101,947 in third party contributions 
raised through our events) was donated to Childline. We used our 
events to raise money from third parties for The Alzheimer’s Society 
including requesting donations in return for entry for awards and 
taking collections at the events. Every year, the Group offers each 
employee a paid day off to spend volunteering for the not-for-profit 
cause or charity of their choice. Employee contributions were raised 
through a range of Company-wide fundraising events including 
sporting events and bake sales. We also operate a Give As You 
Earn scheme through the payroll and offer employees the option to 
undertake Volunteer Days.
The Strategic Report was approved by the Board of Directors and 
signed by order of the Board.

DIRECTORS’ REPORT
Qualifying third party indemnity provisions
By virtue of article 217 of the Articles of Association of the Company, 
a qualifying third party indemnity provision (within the meaning given 
by section 234 of the Companies Act 2006) is in force at the date of 
this report in respect of each Director of the Company and was in 
force throughout the year. 
The Company has purchased appropriate insurance in respect of 
legal actions against Directors and officers.
Charitable and political donations
During the year the Group made a donation to its nominated 
charity for 2017, Alzheimer’s, of £87,727, which included third 
party donations collected at events of £67,387 (2016: donation to 
Childline of £118,855 including third party collections of £101,947). 
No political donations were made during the year (2016: £nil). 
Employment policy
The Group is an equal opportunities employer and appoints 
employees without reference to age, sex, ethnic group or  
religious beliefs.
It is the Group’s policy to give full consideration to suitable 
applications for employment by disabled persons. Opportunities 
also exist for employees of the Group who become disabled to 
continue in their employment or to be trained for other positions in 
the Group.
The Group actively encourages employee involvement at all levels, 
both through monthly employee briefings and by direct access to 
managers and the Executive Committee. In addition, the Share 
Incentive Plan as described in note 26 encourages employees’ 
participation in the Group’s performance.
All employees are regularly briefed on the financial and economic 
factors affecting the Group’s performance and new initiatives 
through monthly town hall meetings and management cascade 
communication. 
Significant agreements
The Group’s bank facility agreement, referred to in note 24 to the 
financial statements, is a significant agreement that is terminable 
on a change of control of the Company. In addition, awards under 
certain of the long-term incentive plans, details of which are set 
out in note 26, will vest or may be exchanged for awards of a 
purchaser’s shares upon a change of control of the Company.
As part of the acquisition of MarketMakers, an earn-out payment 
was agreed with its former shareholders in the assumption that 
certain EBITDA targets for 2017 were met. We expect this to be 
concluded in the first half of 2018.
Conflicts of interest
Following the implementation of legislation on conflicts of interest, 
reflected in the changes to the Company’s Articles of Association in 
2008, procedures are in place to deal with such conflicts and they 
have operated effectively.
Financial instruments
A statement in relation to the financial risk management and use of 
financial instruments by the Group is presented in note 29 to the 
financial statements.
Information required under the listing rules
In accordance with the UK Financial Conduct Authority’s Listing 
Rules (LR 9.8.4C), the information to be included in the annual 
report and financial statements, where applicable, under LR 9.8.4, 
is set out in this Directors’ report, with the exception of details of 
transactions with controlling shareholders which is set out on  
page 51.
Going concern

DIRECTORS’ STATEMENT ON CORPORATE GOVERNANCE
The Board is committed to high standards of corporate governance 
and supports the UK Corporate Governance Code published in 
April 2016. The Board sets out its report below on how the Group 
has applied the principles of, and complied with, the UK Corporate 
Governance Code during the year.
Compliance statement
The Company has applied the provisions set out in the UK 
Corporate Governance Code throughout the year. The Board is 
committed to maintaining a structure, which establishes a sound 
corporate governance framework on behalf of the Company’s 
shareholders. Throughout the year, the Group has complied with all 
the provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code.
The Board
As at 31 December 2017 the Board had four Non-Executive 
Directors and two Executive Directors (Chief Executive and Chief 
Financial Officer). Biographies for each currently serving director 
are shown on pages 28 to 29. The Board endeavours to maintain 
diversity in its composition with respect to gender, skills, knowledge 
and length of service in order to ensure the balanced and effective 
running of the Company. Neil Johnson (previously Ron Sandler until 
3 January 2018) is Chairman of the Board and is an independent 
Non-Executive Director, who leads the Board and ensures that both 
Executive and Non-Executive Directors make available sufficient 
time to carry out their duties in an appropriate manner, that all 
directors receive sufficient financial and operational information, and 
that there is proper debate at Board meetings.
The Board is responsible for the leadership of the Company and 
the Group, and in discharging that responsibility it makes decisions 
objectively and in the best interests of the Group. The Board sets 
the vision, values and standards for the Group. The balance of 
the Board, together with the advice sought from the Executive 
Committee members and the Company’s external advisors, ensures 
that no one individual has unfettered powers of decision. The Board 
delegates day-to-day responsibility for the running of the Company 
to the Chief Executive. 
The Chairman is responsible for the effective performance of the 
Board through a schedule of matters reserved for approval by the 
Board (comprising issues considered most significant to the Group 
in terms of financial impact and risk) and control of the Board 
agenda. The Chairman conducts Board and shareholder meetings 
and ensures that all directors are properly briefed. The Chief 
Executive, supported by the Chief Financial Officer and Executive 
Committee, is responsible to the Board for running the business 
and implementing strategy. The Board reviews the performance of 
the Executive Directors and the Group against agreed budgets and 
against the Group’s objectives, strategy and values.
The Senior Independent Director is William Eccleshare, who is 
also a member of the Remuneration and Nomination Committees. 
The Company Secretary is Helen Silver. The Company Secretary 
assists the Chairman in ensuring there is efficient communication 
between all directors, the committees and senior management, 
as well as the professional development of directors. Independent 
advisors including lawyers, remuneration specialists and external 
auditors are available to advise the Non-Executive Directors at 
the Company’s expense. All of the Non-Executive Directors are 
independent. Committee meetings are held independently of Board 
meetings and invitations to attend are extended by the Committee 
Chairman to other directors, the Group’s advisors and management 
as appropriate. The terms of reference of the Audit Committee, the 
Nomination Committee and the Remuneration Committee, including 
their roles and the authority delegated to them by the Board, are 
available on request from the Company Secretary and will be 
available at the AGM.

GOVERNANCE REPORT

Board assessment and Directors’ 
performance evaluation 
The Board undertakes a formal evaluation of its own performance 
and that of its committees and individual directors. Individual 
evaluation aims to show whether each director continues to 
contribute effectively and to demonstrate commitment to the role 
(including commitment of time for Board and committee meetings 
and other duties). Evaluations are undertaken annually by self-
assessment and the Chairman’s performance is also evaluated 
by the other Non-Executive Directors at a separate meeting 
for this purpose each year. In addition the Chief Executive is 
subject to an annual performance review with the Chairman. New 
directors receive an induction programme and all the directors are 
encouraged to undertake continuous professional development 
programmes as appropriate. The Group maintains insurance cover 
in respect of legal action against its directors.
Management structure
The Board delegates the day-to-day running of the Company to 
the Executive Directors, who in turn share the operational running 
of the Group with the Executive Committee. Throughout the year, 
the Executive Committee was the primary body implementing 
operational management across the Group. The role of the 
Executive Committee is to review:
• Financial performance and budget (at operational level);
• Human capital management; 
• Operational efficiency and developments (including Group IT, 
procurement and facilities);
• Product development; 
• Market development;
• Business planning;
• Acquisition needs;
• Internal and external communications; and
• Business transformation and change management.
The biographies of the members of the Executive Committee are 
set out on page 30. Supporting the Executive Committee are the 
Portfolio Directors who are responsible for specific market segments 
and the expert leaders who lead the teams delivering functional 
expertise. The focus on our markets and audience enables us 
to build a deeper understanding of the commercial opportunities 
across each market. We know that our customers want flexible 
content that works seamlessly across multiple platforms. By 
leveraging this market insight and an understanding of our 
customer requirements we are able to offer a higher value customer 
proposition. The expert teams provide the expertise and scale 
that allows us to effectively and efficiently support the delivery of 
commercial opportunities across each market. The creation of these 
expert teams also enables us to effectively manage our cost base 
and to prioritise investment across the business.
Relations with shareholders
The Company encourages meaningful dialogue with all 
shareholders. Shareholder communication centres primarily on 
the publication of annual reports, periodic press releases, investor 
presentations and trading updates. The Chairman and Executive 
Directors are available for discussions with shareholders throughout 
the year and particularly around the time of results announcements. 
The Senior Independent Director is also available should any 
shareholder wish to draw any matters to his attention. The Directors 
are available for comment throughout the year and at all General 
Meetings of the Company. Centaur Media values the views of its 
shareholders and recognises their interest in the Company’s strategy 
and performance, Board membership and quality of management. 
The Group therefore has an active programme to meet and 
make presentations to its current and potential shareholders to 
discuss its objectives. The AGM is used to communicate with 
investors and they are encouraged to attend the AGM and to 
participate in proceedings formally or sharing their views with Board 
members informally after the meeting. The Chairmen of the Audit, 
Remuneration and Nomination Committees are available to answer 
questions. Separate resolutions are proposed on each issue so that 
they can be given proper consideration and there is a resolution to 
approve the annual report and financial statements. The Company 
counts all proxy votes and indicates the level of proxies lodged on 
each resolution, after it has been voted on by a show of hands. 
All shareholders can gain access to the annual reports, trading 
updates, announcements, press releases and other information 
about the Company through the Company’s website,  
www.centaurmedia.com. 
Risk assessment
Risks that affect or may affect the business are identified and 
assessed, and appropriate controls and systems implemented to 
ensure that the risk is managed. The Group’s risk register is kept by 
the Company Secretary with the input of the Executive Committee 
and is reviewed by the Audit Committee every six months with 
appropriate mitigation actions also being reported to and overseen 
by the Committee.
The principal risks facing the Group, with associated mitigating 
controls, are detailed on pages 22 to 24 within the Strategic Report.

DIRECTORS’ STATEMENT ON CORPORATE GOVERNANCE
Ethics
The Group carries out its business in a fair, honest and open 
manner, ensuring that it complies with all relevant laws and 
regulations. The Company has specific policies on fraud, director 
conflict, bribery, whistleblowing and slavery and human trafficking, 
which are widely distributed and compliance with these policies is 
monitored. The Board has oversight of the Group’s actions. The 
HR team ensures that new job opportunities are made available 
to existing employees as well as to outside applicants and that all 
employees are able to benefit from training, career development 
and promotion opportunities where appropriate. The recruitment of 
new personnel is made without prejudice and the Group believes 
in equal opportunity and encourages diversity. The analysis of the 
Group’s workforce and Board by gender is set out in the Corporate 
Responsibility Report on page 26.
Through all our interaction with our customers and partners we 
ensure that we treat them fairly and openly whilst abiding by the 
terms of contracts and relevant law. Equally, we treat our suppliers 
fairly and do not exploit them or their employees. 
Monitoring of controls
The Board has overall responsibility for the effectiveness of the 
Group’s system of risk management and internal controls and these 
are regularly monitored by the Audit Committee.
Details of the activities of the Audit Committee in this financial year 
can be found in the Audit Committee Report on page 38.
Greenhouse gas emissions
The disclosure in respect of the greenhouse gas emissions of the 
Group that are attributable to human activity in tonnes of carbon 
dioxide is set out in the Corporate Responsibility Report on page 27.
Fraud
Whilst the Group cannot guarantee to prevent fraud, an internal 
control framework is in place to reduce the likelihood of fraud arising. 
The Group’s whistleblowing policy is available to employees on the 
Company’s intranet, should any employee become aware of any 
incidence of fraud.
Directors’ conflicts
Group and subsidiary directors are required to notify their employing 
company of all directorships they hold. Annual conflict of interest 
disclosures require them to disclose such directorships or other 
relationships, which they or a person connected to them may hold. 
These are reviewed by the Board to assess the impact on the 
Company and whether it would impair the Group’s objectives.
Bribery Act 2010
In response to the Bribery Act 2010, the Board performed a risk 
assessment across the Group and formalised its policy to prevent 
bribery. The Board has in place processes to prevent corruption 
or unethical behaviour. The policy explains what is considered a 
bribe or facilitation payment, which are prohibited, and provides 
guidance over the levels of gifts, entertainment and hospitality that 
are considered reasonable. Training has been mandatory for those 
groups of employees identified and is available as required to new 
joiners. During 2017, an online training programme was made 
available to all employees. The Group’s policy is communicated to 
all appropriate third parties. The more rigorous processes around 
declaring directors’ interests and identifying potential conflicts have 
improved the regular monitoring of the Group’s policy.
Whistleblowing
The Company is committed to the highest standards of integrity and 
honesty. Along with other policies which encourage this behaviour, 
the Group’s whistleblowing policy is available to employees on the 
Company’s intranet. This policy allows all employees to disclose 
openly, in confidence or anonymously, any concerns they may have 
about possible improper practices, in financial or other matters. 
An escalation process has been communicated to employees. 
Any matters raised will be investigated and resolved. The Audit 
Committee will be notified of any issues raised through this process 
and appropriate action taken. However, no incidents were noted 
during the year.
Modern Slavery Act 2015
The Company is committed to implementing and enforcing effective 
systems and controls to ensure modern slavery is not taking 
place anywhere in its business or in any of its supply chains. The 
Company’s slavery and human trafficking statement for the purposes 
of section 54 of the Modern Slavery Act 2015 is available on the 
Company’s website, www.centaurmedia.com. The Group has in 
place an anti-slavery and human trafficking policy which has been 
made available to employees on the Company’s intranet and, from 
2017, is notified to all new joiners. Training has been provided to key 
employees and the policy is communicated to suppliers and other 
third parties where appropriate. 
Capital structure
Information on the share capital structure is included in the Directors’ 
Report on page 31.

AUDIT COMMITTEE REPORT
Dear Shareholder,
I am pleased to present the report of the Audit Committee (‘the 
Committee’) for the year ended 31 December 2017. This report 
details the Audit Committee’s responsibilities and key activities over 
the period. The role of the Committee is to protect the interests of 
shareholders regarding the integrity of financial information published 
by the Group and to oversee the effectiveness of the external audit. 
It does this through reviewing and reporting to the Board on the 
Group’s financial reporting, internal controls and risk management 
processes and the performance, independence and effectiveness of 
the external auditors, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP (‘PwC’). 
Committee composition
During the year, the Committee comprised Non-Executive Directors, 
Robert Boyle (Chairman), Rebecca Miskin and Ron Sandler who 
stood down on 3 January 2018. Their biographies are shown 
on pages 28 and 29. The Group’s Chairman, Neil Johnson, was 
appointed on 3 January 2018 and attends meetings by invitation 
but is not a member of the Committee. The membership of 
the Committee is balanced, and is considered to contain the 
appropriate combination of recent, relevant financial experience 
through the Chairman, as well as competence relevant to the sector.
The Executive Directors, representatives of the external auditors and 
other Group executives regularly attend meetings at the invitation 
of the Committee. The Committee met four times during the year, 
with all members attending. Meetings are held throughout the year, 
and timed to align with the overall financial reporting timetable. At 
least once during the year, the Committee meets separately with the 
external auditors and with management, and as Chairman I am in 
regular direct contact with the external auditors and with the Chief 
Financial Officer. 
Roles and responsibilities
The main roles and responsibilities of the Audit Committee are to:
• Monitor the integrity of the financial statements of the Group 
and any public announcements relating to the Group’s financial 
performance, reviewing (and approving) significant financial 
reporting judgements contained in them;
• Review and monitor the external auditors’ independence and 
objectivity and the effectiveness of the audit process, taking 
into consideration relevant UK professional and regulatory 
requirements;
• Review and assess the Annual Report in order to determine that 
it can advise the Board that, taken as a whole, the Annual Report 
is fair, balanced and understandable, and provides shareholders 
with the information they need to assess the Company’s position 
and performance, business model and strategy as required by 
provision C.1.1 of the UK Corporate Governance Code;
• Make recommendations to the Board in relation to the 
appointment and terms of engagement of the external auditors 
and to review and approve levels of audit and non-audit 
remuneration;
• Develop and implement policy on the engagement of the external 
auditors to supply non-audit services;
• Review the effectiveness of the Group’s internal financial control 
and risk management systems;
• Review the Group’s financial and operational policies and 
procedures to ensure they remain effective and relevant;
• Oversee the whistleblowing arrangements of the Group and to 
ensure they are operating effectively; and
• Report to the Board on how it has discharged its responsibilities.

Financial statements 
During the year and up until the date of this report, the Audit 
Committee undertook the following activities to ensure the integrity 
of the Group’s financial statements and formal announcements:
• Regularly met with management and the Chief Financial Officer 
to discuss the results and performance of the business, including 
regular review of the aged debt position throughout the year;
• Received reports from management on the internal controls 
covering the financial reporting process;
• Reviewed and agreed the external auditors’ strategy in advance of 
their audit for the year; 
• Reviewed compliance with requirements under the UK Corporate 
Governance Code, and in particular its impact on the Strategic 
Report and Viability Statement;
• Discussed the report received from the external auditors regarding 
their audit in respect of the prior year, which included comments 
on significant financial reporting judgements and their findings on 
internal controls; 
• Met with other management personnel including the Head of 
Credit; and
• Reviewed and discussed with management and the Chief 
Financial Officer each formal announcement made by the Group. 
The most significant financial reporting judgements considered by 
the Audit Committee and discussed with the external auditors during 
the year were as follows:
Carrying value of goodwill and intangible assets
The Audit Committee has reviewed management’s assessment of 
the recoverability of the Group’s goodwill and intangible assets and 
whether there is a need for any resulting impairment. The recoverable 
amount of goodwill has been determined through value-in-use 
calculations of each cash-generating unit (‘CGU’) based on formally 
Board approved forecasts for the first three years of the value-in-use 
calculation, and applying a terminal growth rate of 2.0%. 
In 2017 management’s assessment of the recoverability of the 
Group’s goodwill and intangible assets resulted in no impairment 
being recognised against the goodwill. The Committee has paid 
particular attention to the judgements and assumptions used to 
forecast cash flows, particularly around revenue and adjusted
2
 
EBITDA growth rates. The Committee was satisfied that the 
forecasts reflect the CGUs’ historical budgeting performance and 
that reasonable sensitivities were performed, that the value-in-use 
calculation reflects management’s best estimate, and that the booking 
of no impairment against any segment is appropriate. As a result the 
Audit Committee was satisfied with the carrying value of goodwill and 
intangible assets in the Group balance sheet.
Further details on goodwill and the impairment testing are included 
in note 10 to the financial statements.
Recoverability of trade receivables
Gross trade receivables over 90 days overdue fell to £1.6m at 
the end of 2017 from £4.1m (£3.2m excluding Home Interest) at 
the end of 2016. The Committee notes that collectability of trade 
receivables is a judgemental area. The Committee has reviewed 
management’s detailed assessment of the recoverability of the trade 
receivables balance, and the methodology used to determine the 
provision required, which includes a range of sensitivities. The Group 
continues to operate a policy of accruing a certain percentage of 
revenue against a provision for doubtful debts however, it has been 
deemed that no further exceptional provision is required in 2017.
The Committee is pleased that improvements to front-end billing and 
credit control processes have been made during the course of the 
year and the Group continues to make good progress on collecting 
current receivables and reducing the amount of days’ sales 
outstanding (‘DSO’). Both the Audit Committee and the Board have 
paid close attention to quantum and ageing of trade receivables  
throughout the year, reviewed the processes and controls 
implemented to manage the risk of these issues recurring, and have 
received regular reports from management, including the Head of 
Credit. 
Further details on trade receivables and the associated provision are 
shown in notes 18 and 29.
Other areas of judgement discussed with the external auditors were 
as follows:
Adjusting items 
The Audit Committee has challenged management strongly over 
recent financial reporting periods with regard to the presentation 
of exceptional items and other alternative performance measures. 
Adjusting items disclosed in the year include the profit on disposal 
of the Home Interest segment disposal, earn-out consideration and 
amortisation of acquired intangible assets mainly in relation to the 
acquisition of MarketMakers and Oystercatchers (see below), and 
exceptional costs arising in relation to restructuring activities. The 
Committee notes that the restructuring activities (both staff-related 
and corporate) arise from specific change programmes during 
the year, and that they are material and could therefore distort 
the user’s view of the Group’s results. The Committee is satisfied 
that it is appropriate to present these items as adjusting items on 
the basis that they assist the user in assessing the core operating 
performance of the Group. 
The Committee assesses the appropriateness of all alternative 
performance measures disclosed as adjusting and the impact these 
have on the presentation of the Group’s results, and is satisfied that 
they do not inappropriately replace or obscure IFRS measures. 
Further details on adjusting items are included in notes 1(b) and 4 to 
the financial statements.

GOVERNANCE REPORT

Acquisition of MarketMakers
On 2 August 2017, the Group acquired 100% of Market Makers 
Incorporated Limited which constituted a Business Combination 
under IFRS3. 
The acquisition resulted in an initial consideration of £18.9m which 
has been allocated for fair value adjustments in relation to identified 
intangible assets (brand, customer contracts and relationships and 
in-house developed CRM systems) of £5.1m and goodwill of £11m 
cash and working capital amounted to £3.0m. Amortisation of the 
acquired intangibles was £0.6m in the year and would be £1.3m on 
a full year basis.
The Committee has reviewed the results of the purchase price 
allocation exercise performed by management to identify and value 
intangible assets and concluded that it is appropriate.
Details of the acquisition of MarketMakers are set out in notes 14 
and 23 to the financial statements. 
Disposal of Home Interest
On 1 August 2017, the Group completed the disposal of the 
Home Interest Segment for £32.8m. The Committee is satisfied 
that the accounting for its disposal and treatment of the applicable 
transitional services arrangement are fair and appropriate. Details 
of the disposal are set out in notes 8 and 15 to the financial 
statements.
Acquisition of Oystercatchers
On 30 September 2016, the Group acquired the business and 
assets of The Oystercatchers LLP , which constitutes a Business 
Combination under IFRS 3. 
The agreement included contingent consideration relating to an 
earn-out arrangement of up to £1.2m. 
Since payment of this consideration was linked to employees 
remaining in the business up to 31 March 2017, the charge for this 
earnout has been taken through the statement of comprehensive 
income as a remuneration expense. In both 2017 and 2016, 
charges of £0.6m have been treated as an adjusting item in line with 
the Group’s accounting policy. 
The Committee notes that the amounts involved are material 
and require judgement, and concurs with the treatment of the 
acquisition, including its presentation, in the financial statements.
Further details on the business combination are presented in note 
14 to the financial statements.
Going concern and viability
The Audit Committee received a report setting out the going 
concern review undertaken by management which forms the basis 
of the Board’s going concern conclusion. During 2015, the Group 
agreed a four year £25.0m multi-currency revolving bank facility. The 
Committee notes that working capital was strongly positive in the 
year and the Group has now no draw down from the facility. The 
Committee has reviewed forecasts to cover the eighteen months 
from signature date with various downside scenarios explored. The 
Committee has concluded that the adoption of the going concern 
basis is appropriate. 
In addition, the Committee has assessed the statement in relation 
to the longer-term viability of the Group and of the Group’s 
principal risks to viability, including reviewing the long-term financial 
projections for the period over which the statement is made, and 
reviewing qualitative and quantitative analysis and scenario testing 
prepared by management. The Committee concluded that the 
statement in relation to the longer-term viability of the Group in the 
Strategic Report is appropriate.
Risk management
The Group’s management is responsible for the identification, 
assessment and management of risk, as well as for designing 
and operating the system of internal control as set out in the 
Strategic Report on pages 6 to 27. The Committee has assessed 
management’s identification of risk and concluded that appropriate 
mitigating actions are being taken. The Auditor has also detailed 
certain risks in his report and set out the work performed to satisfy 
himself that these have been properly reflected in the Financial 
Statements. The Committee has worked closely with management 
and received detailed information to assess the effectiveness of 
internal financial control and risk assessment and management 
systems, and report on them to the Board (which retains ultimate 
responsibility). Details of financial risks are set out in note 29.
Having monitored the Group’s risk management and internal control 
system, and having reviewed the effectiveness of material controls, 
including financial, operational and compliance controls, the 
Committee confirms on behalf of the Board that it has not identified 
any significant control failings or weaknesses at any time during the 
year and to the date of this report. The Committee is satisfied that 
appropriate actions have been taken to address weaknesses in the 
order to cash cycle following the accounting system implementation 
during 2015, and that significant improvements in cash collections 
have now been instrumental in driving strong cash collection.

AUDIT COMMITTEE REPORT
Risk of fraud 
The Committee considered the risk of fraudulent financial reporting 
in the business, and through its review of the effectiveness of 
internal controls and reporting from management, has concluded 
that adequate controls were in place during the year.
Whistleblowing
The Committee reviewed the Group’s whistleblowing policy and 
is satisfied that this has met FCA rules and good standards of 
corporate governance. Further details of the whistleblowing 
policy are set out within the Directors’ Statement on Corporate 
Governance on page 36.
Internal audit
The Committee considered whether it was appropriate to appoint 
internal auditors and concluded that this is not currently required 
given the size of the business, its relatively centralised operations 
and the risks identified together with the mitigating controls.
External audit 
The Group’s external auditors are PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP . 
The Committee monitors the external audit process to ensure 
high standards of quality and effectiveness. This was assessed 
throughout the year using a number of measures, including:
• Reviewing the quality and scope of planning of the audit and the 
level of fees;
• Monitoring the independence and transparency of the audit; and
• Obtaining feedback from management and the Directors on the 
quality of the audit team, their business understanding and audit 
approach, and approving reappointment.
PwC have been the Company’s external auditor since its 
incorporation in 2004. The appointment was subject to competitive 
tender in 2016.
The Audit Committee has considered the independence and 
objectivity of the external auditors through a careful review of their 
terms of engagement, scope of work and level of fees (which are 
shown in note 3 to the financial statements). This included reviewing 
the nature and extent of non-audit services supplied by the external 
auditors to the Group, seeking to balance objectivity and value  
for money. 
In light of new regulations, the Committee reviewed and approved 
updates to the Group’s policy regarding non-audit services during 
2016. The external auditors are excluded from providing any 
non-audit services that individually, or in aggregate, may impair 
the independence of the auditor. Prior approval from the Audit 
Committee is required for any permitted audit related or other 
services in accordance with the Audit Committee’s policy, and 
effective from 1 January 2017 fees for any such services should not 
exceed 70% of the fee for the external audit in any given year.
During the year, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP provided non-
audit services to the Group in respect of the Group’s Class One 
transactions. Work consisted of providing an Accountant’s Opinion 
On Pro Forma Financial Information provided within the Group’s 
circular and a review of the Group’s working capital provided to 
the Board pursuant to those two Class One transactions. The 
Committee decided that in view of the urgency of the reporting 
requirements and PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP’s familiarity with the 
business being disposed of they were likely to be the lowest risk and 
most financial effective providers of these services. 
Following the update to the Group’s non-audit services policy, 
tax advisory and compliance services have no longer been 
supplied since 31 December 2016. The external auditors’ report 
to the Directors and the Audit Committee also confirmed their 
independence in accordance with auditing standards and the 
Committee concurred. Should such services be required in the 
forthcoming year we are likely to use alternative suppliers.
Self-assessment
During the period the Audit Committee performed a formal, 
questionnaire based, self-assessment of the effectiveness of the 
Audit Committee with satisfactory results.
Report to the Board
The Board has requested the Committee to confirm that in its 
opinion the Board can make the required statement that the Annual 
Report taken as a whole is fair, balanced and understandable and 
provides the information necessary for shareholders to assess 
the Company’s position and performance, business model and 
strategy. The Committee has given this confirmation on the basis of 
its review of the whole Annual Report, underpinned by involvement 
in the planning for its preparation, review of the processes to 
ensure the accuracy of factual content and by assurances from the 
Remuneration Committee.
Independent auditors
A resolution is to be proposed at the Annual General Meeting for  
the re-appointment of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP as auditors of 
the Company.

NOMINATION COMMITTEE REPORT
Dear Shareholder,
I am pleased to present the report of the Nomination Committee 
for the year ended 31 December 2017. This report details the 
Committee’s ongoing responsibilities and key activities over the 
period. The Committee comprised Ron Sandler (Chairman) until 
3 January 2018, myself with effect from 3 January 2018, William 
Eccleshare and Rebecca Miskin, ensuring that there is a majority of 
independent Non-Executive Directors on the Committee.
Nomination Committee Responsibilities
The Committee’s key responsibilities include:
• Reviewing the Board’s structure, size and composition;
• Reviewing the composition of Board Committees;
• Defining the role and competencies required for appointments to 
the Board;
• Identifying, nominating and reviewing candidates for appointment 
to the Board;
• Putting in place plans for succession for the Chairman and 
other members of the Board, the Chief Executive and the Chief 
Financial Officer; and
• Reviewing the leadership needs of the organisation, both 
Executive and Non-Executive.
The appointment of directors is a matter for the Board, which 
considers recommendations of the Nomination Committee. The 
Committee is responsible for ensuring that the Board and the Board 
Committees are properly constituted and balanced in terms of skills, 
experience and diversity. Our policy on Board diversity is set out in 
the Directors’ Report above and during the year we had two female 
Board members, comprising 33% of the Board.
Activities during the year
During the second part of the year, the primary focus of the 
Committee was to identify and appoint a new Chairman in preparation 
for the departure of Ron Sandler. The Committee was led by William 
Eccleshare for this purpose and followed a rigorous process that 
was approved by the Board and supported by executive search 
consultants. Following a comprehensive short list and interview 
exercise, my appointment was recommended to the Board by the 
Committee and I was confirmed as Chairman and a member of the 
Nomination Committee with effect from 3 January 2018.
Zygos Partnership, the external search consultancy used in the 
search process has no other connection with Centaur Media. 
For the remainder of the year the Committee focused on the 
responsibilities set out above, including in particular undertaking a 
review of the Board’s structure, size and composition, as well as the 
effectiveness of the Board and its Committees.

REMUNERATION COMMITTEE REPORT
Annual Statement
Dear Shareholder,
On behalf of the Board, I am pleased to present the Remuneration 
Report for the year ended 31 December 2017. This report is in 
three parts: this Annual Statement; the Remuneration Policy Report; 
and the Annual Report on Remuneration. As no changes are being 
proposed to the existing Remuneration Policy, only the advisory 
shareholder vote on the Annual Report on Remuneration will be 
tabled at the Annual General Meeting on 3 May 2018. 
Committee membership and work of the 
Committee during the year
During the year, Centaur Media‘s Remuneration Committee 
comprised myself (Chairman), Ron Sandler, Robert Boyle, and 
William Eccleshare.
The Committee met four times during 2017. The main Committee 
activities during the year (full details of which are set out in the 
relevant sections of this report) included:
• agreeing Executive Director base salary levels from 1 April 2017;
• agreeing the performance against the targets for the 2016 annual 
bonus awards;
• setting the performance targets for the 2017 annual bonus;
• agreeing the award levels and earnings per share and Total 
Shareholder Return (TSR) targets for the 2017 LTIP awards. This 
included a consultation exercise with the Company’s largest 
investors;
• reviewing the Company’s share dilution position;
• review draft Gender Pay disclosures; and
• agreeing the new Non-Executive Chairman’s fee level and the 
departing arrangements for the outgoing Chairman.
Context for executive remuneration at 
Centaur Media
Executive remuneration consists of a base salary, pension 
contribution, benefit provision and, subject to performance 
conditions, an annual bonus plan, part paid in cash and part 
deferred into shares, and shares awarded annually under an LTIP . 
Incentive pay is subject to clawback and malus provisions and, 
post-vesting, Executive Directors are required to retain 50% of the 
net of tax shares awarded until they have satisfied the Company’s 
share ownership guidelines. The Committee considers that the 
current Remuneration Policy remains appropriate and that it satisfies 
the Committee’s objective to operate a remuneration structure which 
successfully promotes the long-term success of the Group and 
fully aligns the interests of the Executive Directors with those of our 
shareholders. As such, no changes are being proposed at the  
2018 AGM.
Implementation of the Remuneration Policy 
in 2017
• Base salary levels were not increased from 1 April 2017 and there 
were no changes to pension or benefit provision;
• Performance against financial and personal/strategic targets in 
the year ended 31 December 2017 resulted in the Remuneration 
Committee awarding bonuses of 37% and 50% of the maximum 
for the Chief Executive and Chief Financial Officer respectively;
• LTIP awards granted to the Chief Executive in 2015, which 
were due to vest in March 2018, based on performance to 31 
December 2017 will lapse as a result of failing to meet threshold 
EPS and TSR performance targets.
• LTIP awards were granted to the Chief Executive and Chief 
Financial Officer on 24 April 2017 over shares equal to 100% of 
salary based on EPS and TSR performance targets. While the 
original intention was to grant awards over 150% of salary, based 
on EPS, TSR, EBITDA and cumulative free cash flow targets, the 
Remuneration Committee reverted to the normal 100% of salary 
grant level based on EPS and TSR only, following consultation 
with the Company’s major investors.
Implementing the Remuneration Policy  
for 2018
In respect of implementing the Remuneration Policy for Executive 
Directors in 2018:
• Base salary levels for Executive Directors will increase from  
1 April 2018 by 2% in line with general workforce increases;
• There will be no changes to pension and benefit provision;
• The annual bonus will continue to be capped at 100% of salary, 
with the majority of bonus potential measured against financial-
based targets and a minority based on strategic targets. Any 
annual bonus greater than 75% of basic salary will continue to 
be awarded in Centaur Media Plc shares and deferred for three 
years; and
• LTIP awards are expected to be granted on a basis consistent 
with awards granted in prior years in terms of grant levels (100% 
of salary) and performance targets (50% based on EPS, 50% 
based on relative Total Shareholder Return).
We trust that you find this Report to be informative and we hope 
to receive your support for the Annual Report on Remuneration at 
our forthcoming AGM. It is the intention of the Committee to have a 
further review of Remuneration policy which will be discussed with 
shareholders during 2018, ahead of the need to put the policy to 
shareholders for approval in 2019.

DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION POLICY
Centaur Media’s shareholders approved the Directors’ 
Remuneration Policy at the 2016 AGM held on 11 May 2016. We 
have included an updated version of the Policy to provide context 
for the Annual Report on Remuneration. It has been updated only to 
make it easier to follow and to take account of the changes to the 
Board, so the substance remains unchanged. A copy of the Policy 
approved at the 2016 AGM can be found in the 2015 Annual Report 
and at www.centaurmedia.com/investors.
Centaur Media recognises the need to attract, retain and incentivise 
executives with the appropriate skills and talent to manage and 
develop the Group’s businesses, drive the Group’s strategy and 
deliver shareholder value. The main principles of the Directors’ 
Remuneration Policy are:
• To achieve total remuneration packages that are competitive in 
the sector within which the Group operates and with the market 
in general; 
• To provide an appropriate balance between fixed and variable 
remuneration which rewards high levels of performance; and 
• To incentivise and retain management and to align their interests 
with those of shareholders.
Considerations of employment conditions 
elsewhere in the group
The Committee considers the general base salary increases for all 
employees when determining the annual salary increases for the 
Executive Directors. Employees have not been consulted in respect 
of the design of the Group’s Executive Director Remuneration Policy, 
although the Committee will keep this approach under review.
Consideration of shareholder views
The Committee considers shareholder feedback received in relation 
to the Annual Report and AGM each year. This feedback, plus any 
additional feedback received during the course of the year is then 
considered as part of the Company’s annual review of remuneration 
policy. In addition, the Committee will seek to engage directly with 
major shareholders and their representative bodies should any 
material changes be made to the Directors’ Remuneration Policy. 
Details of votes for and against the resolution to approve last 
year’s Remuneration Report are set out in the Annual Report on 
Remuneration. 
Directors’ Remuneration Policy –  
summary table
The table below sets out the remuneration policy that was approved 
by shareholders in 2016 and which became formally effective from 
the date of the 2016 AGM. 
Note that payments may be made under arrangements in place 
prior to this policy becoming effective (including pension, other 
benefits and incentives). 
The remuneration policy offered to employees of the Group will be 
adapted to reflect local market practice and seniority.

Notes
1.
 The Annual Report on Remuneration sets out how the Company implemented the policy presented above in 2017 and will apply it in 2018.
2.
  Not all employees have a bonus opportunity, and below Executive Director level bonus opportunities are generally lower. Participation in the LTIP is limited to Executive Directors 
and certain selected senior management. Other employees are eligible to participate in the Company’s all employee share plan. In general, these differences arise to ensure 
remuneration arrangements are competitive in the market, together with the fact that remuneration of the Executive Directors and senior executives typically has a greater 
emphasis on performance related pay. All bonus schemes are discretionary.
3.
  The choice of performance metrics applicable to the annual bonus plan reflect the Committee’s belief that any incentive compensation should be appropriately challenging and 
primarily tied to financial measures.
4.
  The TSR and EPS performance conditions applicable to the LTIP were selected by the Committee on the basis that they reward the delivery of long-term returns to shareholders 
and the Group’s financial growth, and are consistent with the Company’s objective of delivering long-term value to shareholders.
5.
 Executive Directors may participate in any all-employee share plan, in line with HMRC limits, and to the extent offered.

Notes
Fixed pay consists of salary from 1 April 2018. The value of benefits 
and pension have been estimated for 2018.
1. Target performance is the level of performance required to deliver 
50% of the maximum bonus and 25% of the maximum LTIP value 
(see below). 
2. Maximum performance would result in a maximum bonus 
payment of 100% of salary and full vesting of the maximum LTIP 
award (100% of salary for Andria Vidler and Swag Mukerji).
3. No share price appreciation has been assumed. 
Approach to recruitment and promotions
The remuneration package for a new Executive Director would 
be set in accordance with the terms of the Company’s prevailing 
approved remuneration policy at the time of appointment and would 
take into account the skills and experience of the individual, the 
market rate for a candidate of that experience and the importance of 
securing the relevant individual. 
On recruitment, salary may (but need not necessarily) be set below 
the normal market rate, with phased increases as the executive 
gains experience. The maximum annual bonus would be no more 
than 100% of salary and grants under the LTIP would be limited to 
a maximum of 100% of salary (200% in exceptional circumstances). 
In addition, on recruitment the Company may compensate for 
amounts foregone from a previous employer (using Listing Rule 
9.4.2 if necessary) taking into account the quantum foregone and, 
as far as reasonably practicable, the extent to which performance 
conditions apply, the form of award and the time left to vesting.
For an internal appointment, any variable pay element awarded in 
respect of their prior role should be allowed to pay out according 
to its terms. Any other ongoing remuneration obligations existing 
prior to appointment may continue, provided that they are put to 
shareholders for approval at the earliest opportunity.
The Committee may agree that the Company will meet relocation, 
legal fees or incidental costs where appropriate.
Executive director service contracts and 
loss of office payments
The current Executive Directors have service contracts which have 
a twelve month notice period. In respect of Andria Vidler’s service 
contract (dated 30 October 2013), at the Board’s discretion, a 
payment in lieu of any unexpired notice may be paid, comprising 
an amount for base salary, pension and any accrued holiday 
entitlement. The amount may be paid in one lump sum or in two 
instalments and mitigation will be applied to the second instalment. 
If termination is within six months of a change of control, a payment 
equal to 12 months’ salary, pension and accrued holiday pay is 
payable. Where the Company terminates the contract in any other 
manner, any damages shall be calculated in accordance with 
common law principles including those relating to mitigation of loss. 
Notwithstanding the above, the Company is entitled to terminate 
employment without compensation, damages or payment in lieu of 
notice in specified circumstances (e.g. serious misconduct).
In respect of Swag Mukerji’s service contract (dated 21 September 
2016), at the Board’s discretion, a payment in lieu of any unexpired 
notice may be paid, comprising an amount for base salary, pension 
and any accrued holiday entitlement. The amount may be paid in 
one lump sum or in two instalments and mitigation will be applied 
to the second instalment. If termination is within six months of a 
change of control, a payment equal to 12 months’ salary, pension 
and accrued holiday pay is payable. Where the Company terminates 
the contract in any other manner, any damages shall be calculated 
in accordance with common law principles including those relating 
to mitigation of loss. Notwithstanding the above, the Company is 
entitled to terminate employment without compensation, damages 
or payment in lieu of notice in specified circumstances (e.g. serious 
misconduct).
An annual bonus will normally be payable for the period of the 
financial year served, although it will be pro-rated and paid at the 
normal pay-out date. Any share-based entitlements granted to 
an Executive Director under the Company’s share plans will be 
determined based on the relevant plan rules. However, in certain 
prescribed circumstances, such as death, disability, retirement or 
other circumstances at the discretion of the Committee, ‘good 
leaver’ status may be applied. For good leavers, awards will 
normally vest at the vesting date set out in the relevant award, 
subject to the satisfaction of the relevant performance conditions 
at the time, and reduced pro-rata to reflect the proportion of the 
performance period actually served. However, the Committee has 
discretion to determine that awards vest at cessation of employment 
or to dis-apply time pro-rating.
In addition to the above, outplacement support may be provided 
and legal fees or any other minor incidental costs which are 
considered appropriate may be payable.

The salary increases that will be awarded to the Executive Directors from 1 April 2018 are reflective of the general workforce increase.
Pension and benefits
Pension and benefit provision will be in line with the disclosed policy.
Annual bonus 
The maximum bonus for Executive Directors will remain at 100% of salary. The majority of bonus potential will be measured against financial-
based targets with a minority based on strategic targets. Any annual bonus greater than 75% of basic salary will be awarded in Centaur 
Media Plc shares and deferred for three years.
Long term incentives 
It is intended that LTIP awards granted to Executive Directors in March 2018 under the Centaur Media Long Term Incentive Plan 2016 
(‘2016 LTIP’), will be consistent with awards granted in prior years. The structure and the targets are as follows:
• 50% of the 2018 LTIP award will be based on absolute earnings per share targets. 25% of this part of the award will vest for a threshold 
EPS of 4.15p increasing pro-rata to 100% vesting for a maximum EPS of 7.04p for the year ending 31 December 2020. The EPS target 
range for these awards has been set in line with the Company’s long-term business plan.
• 50% of the 2018 LTIP award will be based on relative total shareholder return (‘TSR’) measured against the constituents of the FTSE 
SmallCap (excluding investment trusts). 25% of this part of the award will vest for median TSR increasing pro-rata to 100% vesting for 
upper quartile TSR over the three years ending 31 December 2020. In addition to the TSR performance condition, the Committee will 
need to be satisfied that the Company’s TSR performance reflects the underlying
1
 financial performance of the Company for this part of 
an award to vest.

Annual bonus for the year (audited)
The Remuneration Committee set performance targets at the start of 2017 in respect of adjusted profit
2
 before tax targets, strategic and 
personal objectives. The adjusted
2
 profit before tax result was £6.6m, against a target of £6.4m. 
The strategic targets were focused on the need to reshape the portfolio based on two strategic transactions – the acquisition of 
MarketMakers and the sale of Home Interest. MarketMakers is now fully integrated and performing well while the post-sale separation of 
Home Interest was completed smoothly whilst the Group continued to perform.
The personal objectives for both Executive Directors were based on improving the revenue mix and cash collection, making progress against 
the operational improvement plan and reducing the company’s exposure to print revenue volatility. Significant progress has been made on 
all three of these. In addition, Andria Vidler had personal objectives to drive customer focus and ensure that content was enriched in order 
to enable further monetisation. Swagatam Mukerji’s additional personal objectives were to improve cash management in the business, 
achieving industry average KPIs whilst reducing the costs of the finance overhead. 
Andria Vidler received a bonus award of £135,000 which comprised £60,000 as a result of profit before tax performance exceeding the 
target, £50,000 in respect of delivering the strategic objectives noted above successfully and £25,000 in respect of the Remuneration 
Committee’s assessment of her strong performance against her personal objectives. 
Swagatam Mukerji received a bonus award of £125,000 which comprised £60,000 as a result of profit before tax performance exceeding 
the target, £50,000 in respect of delivering the strategic objectives noted above and £15,000 in respect of his excellent performance against 
his personal objectives.
Consistent with the approved Remuneration Policy, both annual bonus awards were less than 75% of salary, no bonus deferral will operate 
in respect of the 2017 bonus paid in 2018.

Directors’ shareholding and share interests (audited) 
Share ownership plays a key role in the alignment of our executives with the interests of shareholders. The Executive Directors are expected 
to build up and maintain a shareholding in the Company equal to 100% of salary. Where an executive does not meet this guideline, they are 
required to retain at least 50% of the vested shares net of tax under the Company’s LTIP until the guideline is met. 
The tables below set out details of Executive Directors’ outstanding share awards under LTIP schemes (which will vest in future years,

Performance graph
The graph below shows the total shareholder return (‘TSR’) of Centaur Media Plc compared to the performance of the FTSE SmallCap 
(excluding Investment Trusts) over the last eight and a half years This comparator has been chosen on the basis that it is the group against 
which performance for the purposes of share awards made under the Long-Term Incentive Plan is assessed. Owing to the change to the 
financial year end, there was no financial year ended 30 June 2014 and, instead TSR performance for the 18 months ended 31 December 
2014 is shown.
The graph shows the value, by 31 December 2017, of £100 invested in Centaur Media Plc on 1 July 2009 compared with the value of £100 
invested in the FTSE SmallCap Index (excluding Investment Trusts). The other points plotted represent intervening financial period ends.

ANNUAL REPORT ON REMUNERATION 
External directorships
Swag Mukerji is a non-executive director of Hoppa Limited.
The Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee is responsible for monitoring, reviewing and making recommendations to the Board at least annually on 
the broad policy for the remuneration of the Executive Directors, the Chairman and Company Secretary. It also determines their individual 
remuneration packages, including pension arrangements, bonuses and all incentive schemes and the determination of targets for any 
performance-related pay schemes operated by the Group. The Committee asks the Board, when appropriate, to seek shareholder approval 
for any long-term incentive arrangements, bonuses, incentive payments and any compensation payments and share option entitlements. In 
addition, the Committee monitors and recommends the level and structure of remuneration for senior management.
During the year, the Committee consisted of the following Non-Executive Directors: Rebecca Miskin (Chair), Robert Boyle, William 
Eccleshare and Ron Sandler. The Remuneration Committee meets at least twice each year and met formally four times in 2017. Minutes of 
the Committee are circulated to the Board once they have been approved by the Committee.
External advisors
The Remuneration Committee has access to independent advice where it considers it appropriate. During the year, the Remuneration 
Committee sought advice relating to executive remuneration from FIT Remuneration Consultants (‘FIT’), who were appointed by the 
Remuneration Committee.
The Committee is satisfied that the advice received from FIT in relation to executive remuneration matters during the year under review was 
objective and independent. FIT is a member of the Remuneration Consultants Group and abides by the Remuneration Consultants Group 
Code of Conduct. The fees charged by FIT, on a time spent basis, amounted to £19,813.

STATEMENT OF DIRECTORS’ RESPONSIBILITIES
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report and the financial statements in accordance with applicable law and 
regulations.
Company law requires the Directors to prepare financial statements for each financial year. Under that law the Directors have prepared the 
Group financial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (‘IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union and 
Company financial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union.  
Under company law the Directors must not approve the financial statements unless they are satisfied that they give a true and fair view of 
the state of affairs of the Group and the Company and of the profit or loss of the Group and Company for that period.  In preparing these 
financial statements, the Directors are required to:
• Select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;
• State whether applicable IFRSs as adopted by the European Union have been followed for the Group financial statements and IFRSs as 
adopted by the European Union have been followed for the Company financial statements, subject to any material departures disclosed 
and explained in the financial statements;
• Make judgements and accounting estimates that are reasonable and prudent; and
• Prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Group and Company will 
continue in business.
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain the Group and Company’s 
transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the Group and Company enable them to ensure that 
the financial statements and the Directors’ Remuneration Report comply with the Companies Act 2006 and, as regards the Group financial 
statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation.  
The Directors are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the Group and the hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention 
and detection of fraud and other irregularities.
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the Company’s website.  Legislation in the United Kingdom governing the 
preparation and dissemination of financial statements may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions. 
The Directors consider that the Annual Report and Financial Statements, taken as a whole, is fair, balanced and understandable and 
provides the information necessary for shareholders to assess the Group and Company’s performance, business model and strategy.
Each of the Directors, whose names and functions are listed in the Board of Directors on pages 28 and 29, confirms that, to the best of their 
knowledge:
• The Company financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union, give a true 
and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and loss of the Company;
• The Group financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with IFRS as adopted by the European Union, give a true and 
fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and profit of the Group; and 
The Directors’ Report includes a fair review of the development and performance of the business and the position of the Group and 
Company, together with a description of the principal risks and uncertainties that it faces.  In the case of each director in office at the date 
the Directors’ Report is approved:
• So far as the Director is aware, there is no relevant audit information which the Group and Company’s auditors are unaware; and 
• They have taken all steps that they ought to have taken as a director in order to make themselves aware of any relevant audit information 
and to establish that the Group and Company’s auditors are aware of that information.

• give a true and fair view of the state of the group’s and of the company’s affairs as at 31 December 2017 and of the group’s profit and the 
group’s and the company’s cash flows for the year then ended;
• have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union and, as regards the company’s financial 
statements, as applied in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006; and
• have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 and, as regards the group financial statements, 
Article 4 of the IAS Regulation.
We have audited the financial statements, included within the Annual Report (the ‘Annual Report’), which comprise: the consolidated and 
company statements of financial position as at 31 December 2017; the consolidated statement of comprehensive income, the consolidated 
and company cash flow statements, and the consolidated and company statements of changes in equity for the year then ended; and the 
notes to the financial statements, which include a description of the significant accounting policies.
Our opinion is consistent with our reporting to the Audit Committee.
Basis for opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK) (“ISAs (UK)”) and applicable law. Our responsibilities 
under ISAs (UK) are further described in the Auditors’ responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements section of our report. We 
believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.
Independence
We remained independent of the group in accordance with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the financial statements 
in the UK, which includes the FRC’s Ethical Standard, as applicable to listed public interest entities, and we have fulfilled our other ethical 
responsibilities in accordance with these requirements.
To the best of our knowledge and belief, we declare that non-audit services prohibited by the FRC’s Ethical Standard were not provided to 
the group or the company.
Other than those disclosed in the Directors’ Report, we have provided no non-audit services to the group or the company in the period from 
1 January 2017 to 31 December 2017.

The scope of our audit
As part of designing our audit, we determined materiality and assessed the risks of material misstatement in the financial statements. In 
particular, we looked at where the directors made subjective judgements, for example in respect of significant accounting estimates that 
involved making assumptions and considering future events that are inherently uncertain. 
We gained an understanding of the legal and regulatory framework applicable to the group and company and the industry in which 
it operates, and considered the risk of acts by the group which were contrary to applicable laws and regulations, including fraud. We 
designed audit procedures to respond to the risk, recognising that the risk of not detecting a material misstatement due to fraud is higher 
than the risk of not detecting one resulting from error, as fraud may involve deliberate concealment by, for example, forgery or intentional 
misrepresentations, or through collusion. We focused on laws and regulations that could give rise to a material misstatement in the group 
and company financial statements, including, but not limited to, Companies Act 2006, the Listing Rules and UK tax legislation. Our tests 
included, but were not limited to, agreement of the financial statement disclosures to underlying supporting documentation and enquiries of 
management. There are inherent limitations in the audit procedures described above and the further removed non-compliance with laws and 
regulations is from the events and transactions reflected in the financial statements, the less likely we would become aware of it.
We did not identify any key audit matters relating to irregularities, including fraud. As in all of our audits we also addressed the risk of 
management override of internal controls, including testing journals and evaluating whether there was evidence of bias by the directors that 
represented a risk of material misstatement due to fraud.

INDEPENDENT AUDITORS’ REPORT
Key audit matters
Key audit matters are those matters that, in the auditors’ professional judgement, were of most significance in the audit of the financial 
statements of the current period and include the most significant assessed risks of material misstatement (whether or not due to fraud) 
identified by the auditors, including those which had the greatest effect on: the overall audit strategy; the allocation of resources in the audit; 
and directing the efforts of the engagement team. These matters, and any comments we make on the results of our procedures thereon, 
were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide 
a separate opinion on these matters. This is not a complete list of all risks identified by our audit.
Key audit matter How our audit addressed the key audit matter
Goodwill and intangible assets impairment 
assessment
Refer to page 38 (Audit Committee Report), page 
80 (Key accounting assumptions, estimates and 
judgements) and pages 92 and 93 (Note10).
Determining if an impairment charge is required for 
Goodwill and intangible assets involves significant 
judgements about the future results and cash flows 
of the business, including forecast growth in future 
revenues and EBITDA margins, as well as determining 
an appropriate discount factor and long term growth 
rate. In light of the judgement involved and the 
impairment charges recognised in previous years we 
consider this to be a key audit matter. 
Management used a Value in Use model to compute 
the present value of forecast future cash flows for 
each cash generating unit (‘CGU’) which was then 
compared to the carrying value of the net assets of 
each CGU (including goodwill and intangible assets) to 
determine if there was an impairment.
Management aggregates businesses into CGUs which 
represent the level at which the cash flows of the 
businesses (and goodwill) are monitored and therefore 
this is the level at which management performs its 
impairment assessment.
Market conditions remain challenging and performance 
has varied compared to expectations in certain parts of 
the business. Despite this, management’s impairment 
assessment has not highlighted that any CGU are 
impaired.
We checked and confirmed that the allocation of CGUs to segments was 
consistent with internal management reporting. This has changed from the 
prior year due to the disposal of the Home Interest business which was 
considered a separate CGU. MarketMakers an acquired business during the 
year is included as part of the marketing CGU. 
We reviewed the judgements applied to future forecasts to ensure that these 
included appropriate consideration of historical variances and uncertain market 
conditions. We also considered the appropriateness of sensitivity disclosures 
provided in the financial statements, to explain that impairment amounts would 
not arise from reasonably possible changes to the model’s key assumptions.
We evaluated the Board approved cash flow forecasts for each CGU, and 
understood the process by which these were calculated. We also obtained 
evidence of the Board’s approval of this forecast to 2020.
 − the directors’ key assumptions including revenue and EBITDA growth rates 
used in the cash flow forecasts by comparing them to historical results and 
industry forecasts;
 − the discount rate applied, by assessing the cost of capital for the Group and 
comparable organisations; and
 − the long term growth rate applied, by comparing management’s rate to 
forecast long term GDP growth in the UK and industry growth reports.
We found the key assumptions to be reasonable. The long term growth rate 
applied was within our expected range. The discount rate applied was slightly 
outside our expected range, however sensitivities showed that amending this 
assumption to bring it into our expected range did not cause an impairment in 
any CGU.
With regard to the above procedures, all CGUs showed headroom above the 
carrying value of the net assets including goodwill.
We evaluated the results and disclosure of the sensitivity analyses performed 
by management (as set out in Note10). We determined the results of these 
sensitivities are appropriately disclosed and the sensitivities present a fair 
reflection of reasonably possible changes to assumptions used in the Value in 
Use model. For all CGUs, the sensitivities showed remaining headroom in all 
scenarios. This included Goodwill attributable to the MarketMakers acquisition 
which was included in the impairment testing in respect of the marketing CGU.

Key audit matter How our audit addressed the key audit matter
Recoverability of trade receivables
Refer to page 38 (Audit Committee Report), page 
81 (Key accounting assumptions, estimates and 
judgements) and page 109 (Note 29).
As set out in the Audit Committee Report on page 
38, at the year end £1.3 million of trade receivables 
are aged over 90 days (£1.3 million excluding 
MarketMakers). Significant judgement is required in 
determining the amount to be provided against these 
balances. As a result of the significant judgement 
required and the additional provision established in 
2016 we consider this a key audit matter. Throughout 
2017 management has actively focussed on pursuing 
these amounts and the balance has significantly 
reduced from that held at 31 December 2016.  
At 31 December 2017, trade receivables over 90 days 
past due date was £1.3 million (2016: £4.1 million) 
and the associated provision for impairment of trade 
receivables was £1.5 million (2016: £2.5 million).
The determination of whether trade receivables are collectable involves 
management judgement. Accordingly, with regard to the amount of aged trade 
receivables at the year end, we considered whether management’s judgements 
were appropriate and whether the estimated provision reflected the latest 
available evidence.
We also considered the application of management’s policy for providing 
against aged trade receivables, including the ordinary provisioning policy. 
Management recognise provisions for impairment of trade receivables 
based on specific known facts or circumstances surrounding the invoice or 
customers’ abilities to pay. For example, certain trade receivables may be 
being pursued through legal avenues and these are mainly provided against. 
Customers on direct debit payment plans or where deferred income exists are 
also factors taken into account in determining if a provision for impairment is 
required.
We were able to confirm that the policy for providing against trade receivables 
had been implemented consistently year on year.
For the year end balance, we:
• Tested the ageing of trade receivables and concluded that this was 
accurately determined;
• Tested the accuracy of management’s computations of provisions reflecting 
the history of bad debt write-offs. This included checking that amounts 
excluded from this computation were appropriate, such as amounts invoiced 
in advance of exhibitions (where there is an associated liability held within 
deferred income); and
• Considered the levels of post year end cash received and allocated against 
aged trade receivables at the year end.
We also considered the amount of the provision included in the disposal of the 
Home Interest business and found this to be reasonable.
We considered any residual exposure against the circumstances giving rise to 
the ageing, the ongoing actions taken and in place to collect the aged debt 
(and what has been achieved to date), together with the history of write-offs 
in the business. As noted, determining an appropriate level of provision at the 
year end is a judgemental area and there could therefore be a range of possible 
outcomes. We concluded that the evidence obtained supports the level of 
provision at the year end of £1.5 million and that it is within our acceptable range.
We determined that there were no key audit matters applicable to the company to communicate in our report. The company does not trade 
therefore the key audit matters above are not applicable.

INDEPENDENT AUDITORS’ REPORT
How we tailored the audit scope
We tailored the scope of our audit to ensure that we performed enough work to be able to give an opinion on the financial statements as a 
whole, taking into account the structure of the group and the company, the accounting processes and controls, and the industry in which 
they operate.
The group maintains all of its books and records of its operations in the UK. Therefore the group audit team performed audit procedures on 
the consolidated results and balances. A detailed scoping exercise to determine which entities should be included for testing was therefore 
not performed. 
Materiality
The scope of our audit was influenced by our application of materiality. We set certain quantitative thresholds for materiality. These, together 
with qualitative considerations, helped us to determine the scope of our audit and the nature, timing and extent of our audit procedures on 
the individual financial statement line items and disclosures and in evaluating the effect of misstatements, both individually and in aggregate, 
on the financial statements as a whole. 
Based on our professional judgement, we determined materiality for the financial statements as a whole as follows:
 Group financial statements Company financial statements
Overall materiality £0.3 million (2016: £0.4 million). £0.3 million (2016: £0.4 million).
How we determined it 5% of Adjusted profit before tax (as presented 
on the face of the consolidated statement of 
comprehensive income).
1% of Total Assets (capped to the level of group 
materiality).
Rationale for benchmark applied We believe that Adjusted profit before tax 
provides us with a consistent period on period 
basis for determining materiality and eliminates 
the disproportionate effect of a small number of 
items on the profit before tax. Additionally this is 
how management monitor the performance of 
the group. 
We believe that Total Assets is the primary 
measure used by the shareholders in assessing 
the position of the non-trading holding Company, 
and is an accepted auditing benchmark.
We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to them misstatements identified during our audit above £15,000 (Group audit) 
(2016: £21,500) and £15,000 (Company audit) (2016: £21,500) as well as misstatements below those amounts that, in our view, warranted 
reporting for qualitative reasons.
Going concern
In accordance with ISAs (UK) we report as follows:
Reporting obligation Outcome
We are required to report if we have anything material to add or 
draw attention to in respect of the directors’ statement in the 
financial statements about whether the directors considered it 
appropriate to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in 
preparing the financial statements and the directors’ identification 
of any material uncertainties to the group’s and the company’s 
ability to continue as a going concern over a period of at 
least twelve months from the date of approval of the financial 
statements.
We have nothing material to add or to draw attention to. However, 
because not all future events or conditions can be predicted, this 
statement is not a guarantee as to the group’s and company’s ability 
to continue as a going concern. 
We are required to report if the directors’ statement relating 
to Going Concern in accordance with Listing Rule 9.8.6R(3) is 
materially inconsistent with our knowledge obtained in the audit.
We have nothing to report.

Reporting on other information 
The other information comprises all of the information in the Annual Report other than the financial statements and our auditors’ report 
thereon. The directors are responsible for the other information. Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information 
and, accordingly, we do not express an audit opinion or, except to the extent otherwise explicitly stated in this report, any form of assurance 
thereon. 
In connection with our audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether 
the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit, or otherwise appears to 
be materially misstated. If we identify an apparent material inconsistency or material misstatement, we are required to perform procedures 
to conclude whether there is a material misstatement of the financial statements or a material misstatement of the other information. If, 
based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report 
that fact. We have nothing to report based on these responsibilities. With respect to the Strategic Report, Directors’ Report and Corporate 
Governance Statement, we also considered whether the disclosures required by the UK Companies Act 2006 have been included. 
Based on the responsibilities described above and our work undertaken in the course of the audit, the Companies Act 2006(CA06), ISAs 
(UK) and the Listing Rules of the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) require us also to report certain opinions and matters as described below 
(required by ISAs (UK) unless otherwise stated).
Strategic Report and Directors’ Report
In our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of the audit, the information given in the Strategic Report and Directors’ Report 
for the year ended 31 December 2017 is consistent with the financial statements and has been prepared in accordance with applicable legal 
requirements. (CA06)
In light of the knowledge and understanding of the group and company and their environment obtained in the course of the audit, we did not 
identify any material misstatements in the Strategic Report and Directors’ Report. (CA06)
Corporate Governance Statement
In our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of the audit, the information given in the Corporate Governance 
Statement (pages 33 to 36) about internal controls and risk management systems in relation to financial reporting processes and about 
share capital structures in compliance with rules 7.2.5 and 7.2.6 of the Disclosure Guidance and Transparency Rules sourcebook of the FCA 
(“DTR”) is consistent with the financial statements and has been prepared in accordance with applicable legal requirements. (CA06)
In light of the knowledge and understanding of the group and company and their environment obtained in the course of the audit, we did not 
identify any material misstatements in this information. (CA06)
In our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of the audit, the information given in the Directors’ Statement on Corporate 
Governance (pages 33 to 36) with respect to the company’s corporate governance code and practices and about its administrative, 
management and supervisory bodies and their committees complies with rules 7.2.2, 7.2.3 and 7.2.7 of the DTR. (CA06)
We have nothing to report arising from our responsibility to report if a corporate governance statement has not been prepared by the 
company. (CA06)
The directors’ assessment of the prospects of the group and of the principal risks that 
would threaten the solvency or liquidity of the group
We have nothing material to add or draw attention to regarding:
• The directors’ confirmation on page 22 of the Annual Report that they have carried out a robust assessment of the principal risks facing 
the group, including those that would threaten its business model, future performance, solvency or liquidity.
• The disclosures in the Annual Report that describe those risks and explain how they are being managed or mitigated.
• The directors’ explanation on page 25 of the Annual Report as to how they have assessed the prospects of the group, over what period 
they have done so and why they consider that period to be appropriate, and their statement as to whether they have a reasonable 
expectation that the group will be able to continue in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due over the period of their assessment, 
including any related disclosures drawing attention to any necessary qualifications or assumptions.

INDEPENDENT AUDITORS’ REPORT
We have nothing to report having performed a review of the directors’ statement that they have carried out a robust assessment of the 
principal risks facing the group and statement in relation to the longer-term viability of the group. Our review was substantially less in scope 
than an audit and only consisted of making inquiries and considering the directors’ process supporting their statements; checking that the 
statements are in alignment with the relevant provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code (the “Code”); and considering whether the 
statements are consistent with the knowledge and understanding of the group and company and their environment obtained in the course 
of the audit. (Listing Rules)
Other Code Provisions
We have nothing to report in respect of our responsibility to report when: 
• The statement given by the directors, on page 55, that they consider the Annual Report taken as a whole to be fair, balanced 
and understandable, and provides the information necessary for the members to assess the group’s and company’s position and 
performance, business model and strategy is materially inconsistent with our knowledge of the group and company obtained in the 
course of performing our audit.
• The section of the Annual Report on page 37 describing the work of the Audit Committee does not appropriately address matters 
communicated by us to the Audit Committee.
• The directors’ statement relating to the company’s compliance with the Code does not properly disclose a departure from a relevant 
provision of the Code specified, under the Listing Rules, for review by the auditors.
Directors’ Remuneration
In our opinion, the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited has been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies 
Act 2006. (CA06)
Responsibilities for the financial statements and the audit
Responsibilities of the directors for the financial statements
As explained more fully in the Directors’ Responsibilities Statement set out on page 55, the directors are responsible for the preparation of 
the financial statements in accordance with the applicable framework and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view. The directors 
are also responsible for such internal control as they determine is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free 
from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
In preparing the financial statements, the directors are responsible for assessing the group’s and the company’s ability to continue as a going 
concern, disclosing as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the directors 
either intend to liquidate the group or the company or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.
Auditors’ responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, 
whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditors’ report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, 
but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs (UK) will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. 
Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be 
expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements. 
A further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements is located on the FRC’s website at:  
www.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities. This description forms part of our auditors’ report.
Use of this report
This report, including the opinions, has been prepared for and only for the company’s members as a body in accordance with Chapter 3 of

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
1 SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
The principal accounting policies adopted in the preparation of these consolidated and Company financial statements are set out below, to 
the extent they have not already been disclosed in the other notes below. These policies have been consistently applied to all the periods 
presented, unless otherwise stated. The financial statements are for the Group consisting of Centaur Media Plc and its subsidiaries. Centaur 
Media Plc is a public company limited by shares and incorporated in England and Wales.
(a) Basis of preparation
The consolidated and Company financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards 
(‘IFRS’) as adopted by the European Union and IFRS Interpretations Committee (‘IFRS IC’) and with those parts of the Companies Act 2006 
applicable to companies reporting under IFRS. The financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis. 
Going concern
The financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis. The Directors have carefully assessed the Group’s ability to continue 
trading, and have a reasonable expectation that the Group and Company have adequate resources to continue in operational existence for 
at least 12 months from the date of approval of these financial statements and for the foreseeable future.
Net cash (see reconciliation in note 28) at 31 December 2017 amounted to £4.1m (2016: net debt £14.1m). In June 2015, the Group agreed 
a four year £25m multi-currency revolving credit facility with the Royal Bank of Scotland and Lloyds, which runs to 31 August 2019. Cash 
conversion
4
 during 2017 has remained strong and following the disposal of the Home Interest segment the Group is currently in a strong 
cash positive position. 
The Group has net current liabilities which mainly arise from its normal high levels of deferred income relating to events in the future rather 
than an inability to service its liabilities. An assessment of cash flows for the next three financial years, which has taken into account the 
factors described above, has indicated an expected level of cash generation which would be sufficient to allow the Group to fully satisfy its 
working capital requirements and the guarantee given in respect of its UK subsidiaries, to cover all principal areas of expenditure, including 
maintenance, capital expenditure and taxation during this period, and to meet the financial covenants under the revolving credit facility.
The preparation of financial statements in accordance with IFRS requires the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported 
amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the year. 
Although these estimates are based on management’s best knowledge of the amount, events or actions, the actual results may ultimately 
differ from those estimates.
Having assessed the principal risks and the other matters discussed in connection with the viability statement, the Directors consider it 
appropriate to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing its consolidated financial statements.
New and amended standards adopted by the Group 
None of the new standards and amendments to standards (including the Annual Improvements (2015) to existing standards) that are 
mandatory for the first time for the financial year commencing 1 January 2017 affected any of the amounts recognised in the current period 
or any prior period, and is not likely to affect future periods. 
New standards and interpretations not yet adopted
No new standards, amendments or interpretations effective for the first time for the financial year beginning on or after 1 January 2017 have 
had a material impact on the Group or the Company.
The following new accounting standards and interpretations have been published that are not mandatory for 31 December 2017 reporting 
periods and have not been early adopted by the Group: 
IFRS 9 ‘Financial Instruments’
IFRS 9 addresses the classification, measurement and derecognition of financial assets and financial liabilities, introduces new rules for 
hedge accounting and a new impairment model for financial assets.
Centaur-AR2017.indd   71 26/03/2018   17:26:04 25895  26 March 2018 5:23 PM  Proof Five 25895  26 March 2018 5:23 PM  Proof Five

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
1 SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED
Impact 
The Group has reviewed its financial assets and liabilities and is only expecting trade receivables to be impacted once the new standard is 
adopted on 1 January 2018.
The new impairment model for trade receivables requires the recognition of impairment provisions based on expected credit losses (ECL) 
rather than only incurred credit losses as is the case under IAS 39. The significant majority of the Group’s debt instruments relate to trade 
receivables and as such have been tested using the new impairment model. 
Based on the assessments undertaken to date, the Group does not expect a material change to the loss allowance for trade receivables.
The Group has also reviewed all other financial assets and liabilities, including cash and cash equivalents, and no material impact is 
expected.
Date of adoption by the Group
Must be applied for financial years commencing on or after 1 January 2018. The Group will apply the new rules retrospectively from 
1 January 2018, with the practical expedients permitted under the standard. Comparatives for 2017 will not be restated.
IFRS 15 ‘Revenue from contracts with customers’ 
IFRS 15 sets out the requirements for recognising revenue from contracts with customers, replacing all existing revenue standards. The 
standard requires entities to apportion revenue earned from contracts to individual performance obligations, on a stand-alone selling price 
basis, based on a five-step model framework.
Impact
The Group has performed an impact assessment on the FY17 revenue. The Group’s reported revenue is generated through a high 
volume of low value contracts and therefore a scoping exercise has been performed to identify revenue streams with like commercial 
terms and performance and delivery patterns. Revenue has been reviewed at this level to determine the appropriate revenue recognition 
under IFRS 15.
The results of the impact assessment indicate that there will not be a material change to the timing or quantum of revenue recognition at a 
Group level or at an operating segment level. The impact assessment also indicates that the Group rarely sells products relating to different 
operating segments to the same customer under the same contract. Consequently, a change to revenue recognised in any given operating 
segment is almost wholly the effect of timing differences under IFRS 15.
Date of adoption by the Group
For the Group, transition to IFRS 15 will take effect from 1 January 2018. The half year results for FY18 will be IFRS 15 compliant, with the 
first Annual Report published in accordance with IFRS 15 being that for the year ended 31 December 2018.
As outlined above, given the insignificant change to FY17 reported revenues, the Group does not plan to adopt a fully retrospective transition 
approach and so comparatives for the year ended 31 December 2017 will not be restated.
Other 
There are no other standards that are not yet effective and that would be expected to have a material impact on the entity in the current or 
future reporting periods and on foreseeable future transactions. 
Discontinued operations
In preparing the consolidated financial statements, the results of the Home Interest segment have been reclassified as a discontinued 
operation in both years following disposal of the business on 1 August 2017.
(b) Presentation of non-statutory measures
In addition to statutory measures, the Directors use various non-GAAP key financial measures to evaluate the Group’s performance, and 
consider that presentation of these measures provides Shareholders with an additional understanding of the core trading performance of the 
Group. The measures used are explained and reconciled to their equivalent statutory headings below.

STRATEGIC REPORT

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Adjusted operating profit and adjusted earnings per share
The Directors believe that adjusted results and adjusted earnings per share, split between continuing and discontinued operations, provide 
additional useful information on the core operational performance of the Group to Shareholders, and review the results of the Group on an 
adjusted basis internally. The term ‘adjusted’ is not a defined term under IFRS and may not therefore be comparable with similarly titled profit 
measurements reported by other companies. It is not intended to be a substitute for, or superior to, IFRS measurements of profit.
Adjustments are made in respect of:
• Exceptional items – the Group considers items of income and expense as exceptional and excludes them from the adjusted results 
where the nature of the item, or its magnitude, is material and likely to be non-recurring in nature so as to assist the user of the financial 
statements to better understand the results of the core operations of the Group. Details of exceptional items are shown in note 4.
• Amortisation of acquired intangible assets – the amortisation charge for those intangible assets recognised on business combinations is 
excluded from the adjusted results of the Group since they are non-cash charges arising from investment activities. As such, they are not 
considered reflective of the core trading performance of the Group. Details of amortisation of intangible assets are shown in note 11.
• Share-based payments – share-based payment expenses or credits are excluded from the adjusted results of the Group as the Directors 
believe that the volatility of these charges can distort the user’s view of the core trading performance of the Group. Details of share-based 
payments are shown in note 26.
• Impairment of goodwill – the Directors believe that non-cash impairment charges in relation to goodwill are generally volatile and material, 
and therefore exclude any such charges from the adjusted results of the Group. Previous impairment charges were presented as 
exceptional items. There has not been an impairment charge in the current year. Details of the goodwill impairment analysis are shown in 
note 10.
• Earn-out consideration – deferred or contingent consideration in relation to business combinations recognised in the statement of 
comprehensive income (as a result of being classified as remuneration under IFRS 3) is not considered reflective of the core trading of the 
Group since it results from investment activities and is volatile in nature. As such, statement of comprehensive income items relating to 
business combinations are removed from adjusted results. See notes 14 and 23.
• Acquisition related costs – expenses in relation to business combinations recognised in the statement of comprehensive income is not 
considered reflective of the core trading of the Group since it results from investment activities and is volatile in nature. As such, statement 
of comprehensive income items relating to business combinations are removed from adjusted results. See note 14. 
• Profit or loss on disposal of assets or subsidiaries – profit or loss on disposals of businesses are excluded from adjusted results of 
the Group as they are unrelated to core trading, and can distort a user’s understanding of the performance of the Group due to their 
infrequent and volatile nature. See note 4.
• Other separately reported items – certain other items are excluded from adjusted results where they are considered large or unusual 
enough to distort the comparability of core trading results year-on-year. Details of these separately disclosed items are shown in note 4.
The tax related to adjusting items is the tax effect of the items above that are allowable deductions for tax purposes (primarily exceptional 
items), calculated using the standard rate of corporation tax. See note 7 for a reconciliation between reported and adjusted tax charges.
Further details of adjusting items are included in note 4. A reconciliation between adjusted and statutory earnings per share measures is 
shown in note 9.

Adjusted EBITDA
Adjusted EBITDA is not a measure defined by IFRS. It is defined as adjusted operating profit before depreciation and amortisation of 
intangible assets other than those acquired through a business combination. It is used by the Directors as a measure to review performance 
of the Group, and forms the basis of some of the Group’s financial covenants under its revolving credit facility. Adjusted EBITDA is calculated 
as follows:

Adjusted EBITDA 7.7 8.2
Net debt
Net debt is not a measure defined by IFRS. Net debt is calculated as cash less overdrafts and bank borrowings under the Group’s financing 
arrangements. The Directors consider the measure useful as it gives greater clarity over the Group’s liquidity as a whole. A reconciliation 
between net debt and statutory measures is shown in note 28.
(c) Principles of consolidation
The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of Centaur Media Plc and all of its subsidiaries after elimination of 
intercompany transactions. 
(i) Subsidiaries
Subsidiaries are all entities controlled by the Group. The Group controls an entity when the Group is exposed to, or has rights to, variable 
returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power to direct the activities of the entity. 
Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the Group until the date that the Group ceases to control 
them. In the statement of comprehensive income the results of subsidiaries for which control has ceased are presented separately as 
discontinued operations in the year in which they have been disposed of and in the comparative year.
Intercompany transactions, balances and unrealised gains on transactions between Group companies are eliminated. The accounting 
policies of subsidiaries are consistent with the policies adopted by the Group.

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
1 SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED
(c) Principles of consolidation (continued)
(ii) Business combinations
The acquisition method of accounting is used to account for all business combinations. The consideration transferred for acquisition of 
a subsidiary is measured at the aggregate of fair values of assets transferred, liabilities incurred or assumed to the former owners of the 
acquired business and equity interests issued by the Group in exchange for control of the subsidiary. Acquisition-related costs are expensed 
as incurred and included in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income.
Any deferred consideration to be transferred by the acquirer is recognised at fair value. If the conditions attached to the consideration 
indicate that the payment forms part of the acquisition, a provision is made for the future liability at the acquisition date. Where the deferred 
consideration is contingent on the continued employment of the vendors, such arrangements are recognised in the consolidated statement 
of comprehensive income on a straight-line basis over the period over which the contingent consideration is earned with an associated 
provision on the consolidated statement of financial position. Subsequent changes to the fair value of the contingent consideration are 
recognised in accordance with IAS 39 through the consolidated statement of comprehensive income.
The excess of the aggregate consideration transferred, amount of any non-controlling interest in the acquired entity, and acquisition date fair 
value of any previous equity interest in the acquired entity over the fair value of the net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. 
(d) Foreign currency translation
(i) Functional and presentation currency
Items included in the financial statements of each of the Group’s entities are measured using the currency of the primary economic 
environment in which the entity operates (‘the functional currency’). The consolidated financial statements are presented in pounds sterling, 
which is the Group’s and Company’s functional and presentation currency. 
(ii) Transactions and balances
Foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency using the exchange rates at the dates of the transactions. Foreign 
exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of such transactions and from the translation of monetary assets and liabilities 
denominated in foreign currencies at year end exchange rates are recognised in the statement of comprehensive income. 
(iii) Group companies
The results and financial position of the Group entities that have a functional currency different from the presentation currency are translated 
into the presentation currency as follows:
• Assets and liabilities for each statement of financial position presented are translated at the closing rate at the date of that statement of 
financial position;
• Income and expenses for each statement of comprehensive income are translated at average exchange rates (unless this average is not a 
reasonable approximation of the cumulative effect of the rates prevailing on the transaction dates, in which case income and expenses are 
translated at the rate on the dates of the transactions); and
• All resulting exchange differences are recognised in other comprehensive income. 
On consolidation, exchange differences arising from the translation of the net investment in foreign operations and of borrowings are 
recognised in other comprehensive income. When a foreign operation is sold, exchange differences that were recorded in equity are 
recognised in the statement of comprehensive income as part of the gain or loss on sale. Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the 
acquisition of a foreign entity are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign entity and translated at the closing rate.
(e) Revenue recognition
Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable and represents amounts recoverable by the Group for the 
sales of advertising space, subscriptions and individual publications and revenue from events provided in the normal course of business, net 
of discounts and value added tax.
The Group recognises revenue when the amount of revenue can be reliably measured, it is probable that future economic benefits will flow 
to the entity and specific criteria have been met for each of the Group’s activities as described below.
Sales of advertising space are recognised in the period in which publication occurs. Sales of publications are recognised in the period 
in which the sale is made. Sales of online advertising are recognised over the period during which the advertisements are placed. 
Consideration received in advance for events is deferred and revenue is recognised in the period in which the event takes place.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Revenue from subscriptions to publications and digital services is deferred and recognised on a straight-line basis over the subscription 
period. 
Revenue from project work and consultancy contracts is recognised when the Group has obtained the right to consideration in exchange for 
its performance, which is when a separately identifiable phase (milestone) of a contract has been completed.
(f) Investments
In the Company’s financial statements, investments in subsidiaries are stated at cost less provision for impairment in value. 
(g) Income tax
The tax expense represents the sum of current and deferred tax.
Current tax is based on the taxable profit for the period. Taxable profit differs from profit as reported in the statement of comprehensive 
income because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years, and it further includes items that are 
never taxable or deductible. The Group’s and Company’s liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or 
substantively enacted by the statement of financial position date.
Deferred tax is provided in full, using the liability method, on temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in 
the consolidated financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit. Deferred tax liabilities are 
generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable 
profits will be available to utilise those temporary differences and losses. Such assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary 
difference arises from goodwill or the initial recognition (other than in a business combination) of other assets and liabilities in a transaction 
that affects neither the tax profit nor the accounting profit.
Deferred tax is calculated at the enacted or substantively enacted tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is 
settled or the asset is realised. Deferred tax is charged or credited to the statement of comprehensive income, except when it relates to 
items charged or credited directly to equity, in which case the deferred tax is recognised in other comprehensive income. 
(h) Leases
Agreements under which payments are made to owners in return for the right to use an asset for a period are accounted for as leases. 
Leases that transfer substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership are recognised at the commencement of the lease term as 
finance leases within property, plant and equipment and debt at the fair value of the leased asset or, if lower, at the present value of the 
minimum lease payments. Finance lease payments are apportioned between interest expense and repayments of debt. All other leases are 
classified as operating leases and the cost is recognised in income on a straight-line basis.
(i) Impairment of assets
Assets that are subject to depreciation or amortisation are reviewed for impairment whenever events indicate that the carrying value may not 
be recoverable. An impairment loss is recognised to the extent that the carrying value exceeds the higher of the asset’s fair value less cost 
of disposal and its value-in-use. An asset’s value in use is calculated by discounting an estimate of future cash flows by the pre-tax weighted 
average cost of capital.
(j) Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Work in progress comprises of costs incurred relating to publications and 
exhibitions prior to the publication date or the date of the event.
(k) Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment is stated at historical cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses. The historical cost of 
property, plant and equipment is the purchase cost together with any incidental direct costs of acquisition. Depreciation is calculated to write 
off the cost, less estimated residual value, of assets, on a straight-line basis over the expected useful economic lives to the Group over the 
following periods:
Leasehold improvements – 10 years or the expected length of the lease if shorter
Fixtures and fittings – 10 years
Computer equipment – 3 to 5 years
The estimated useful lives, residual values and depreciation methods are reviewed at the end of each reporting period, with the effect of any 
changes in estimate accounted for on a prospective basis.

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
1 SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED
(l) Intangible assets
(i) Goodwill
Where the cost of a business acquisition exceeds the fair values attributable to the separable net assets acquired, the resulting goodwill 
is capitalised and allocated to the cash-generating unit (‘CGU’) or groups of CGUs that are expected to benefit from the synergies of the 
business combination. Goodwill has an indefinite useful life and is tested for impairment annually on a Group level or whenever events or 
changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.
Each segment is deemed to be a CGU. Goodwill and acquired intangible assets are assessed for impairment in accordance with IAS 36. In 
assessing whether a write-down of goodwill and acquired intangible assets is required, the carrying value of the segment is compared with 
its recoverable amount. Recoverable amount is measured as the higher of fair value less cost of disposal and value-in-use. Any impairment 
is recognised in the statement of comprehensive income (in net operating expenses) and is classified as an adjusting item. Impairment of 
goodwill is not subsequently reversed.
On the disposal of a CGU, the attributable amount of goodwill is included in the determination of the profit or loss on disposal.
(ii) Brands and publishing rights, customer relationships and non-compete arrangements
Separately acquired brands and publishing rights are shown at historical cost. Brands and publishing rights, customer relationships and 
non-compete arrangements acquired in a business combination are recognised at fair value at the acquisition date. They have a finite useful 
life and are subsequently carried at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment losses. 
(iii) Software 
Computer software that is not integral to the operation of the related hardware is carried at cost less accumulated amortisation. Costs 
associated with the development of identifiable and unique software products controlled by the Group that will generate probable future 
economic benefits in excess of costs are recognised as intangible assets when the criteria of IAS 38 ‘Intangible Assets’ are met. They are 
carried at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment losses.
(iv) Amortisation methods and periods
Amortisation is calculated to write off the cost or fair value of assets on a straight-line basis over the expected useful economic lives to the 
Group over the following periods:
Computer software – 3 to 5 years
Brands and publishing rights – 5 to 20 years
Customer relationships – 3 to 10 years or over the term of any specified contract
Separately acquired websites and content – 3 to 5 years
Non-compete arrangements – Over the term of the arrangement
(m) Employee benefits
(i) Post-employment obligations
The Group and Company contribute to a defined contribution pension scheme for the benefit of employees. The assets of the scheme are 
held separately from those of the Group in an independently administered fund. Contributions to defined contribution schemes are charged 
to the statement of comprehensive income when employer contributions become payable.
(ii) Share-based payments 
The Group operates a number of equity-settled share-based compensation plans for its employees. The fair value of the share-based 
compensation expense is estimated using either a Monte Carlo or Black-Scholes option pricing model and is recognised in the statement of 
comprehensive income over the vesting period with a corresponding increase in equity. The total amount to be expensed is determined by 
reference to the fair value of the awards granted:
• Including any market performance conditions;
• Excluding the impact of any service and non-market performance vesting conditions (for example, profitability, sales growth targets, cash 
flow performance and remaining an employee of the entity over a specified time period); and

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
• Including the impact of any non-vesting conditions (for example, the requirement for employees to save.
• The total expense is recognised over the vesting period, which is the period over which all of the specified vesting conditions are to be 
satisfied. At the end of each reporting period, the Group revises its estimates of the number of options that are expected to vest based 
on the non-market vesting and service conditions. It recognises the impact of the revision to original estimates, if any, in the statement of 
comprehensive income, with a corresponding adjustment to equity. The Company issues new shares or transfers shares from treasury 
shares to settle share-based compensation awards. 
The award by the Company of share-based compensation awards over its equity instruments to the employees of subsidiary undertakings 
in the Group is treated as a capital contribution, only if it is left unsettled. The fair value of employee services received, measured by 
reference to the grant date fair value, is recognised over the vesting period as an increase to investment in subsidiary undertakings, with a 
corresponding credit to equity.
(n) Provisions
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past event, it is probable that an 
outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation and the obligation can be reliably estimated.
Provisions for deferred contingent consideration are measured at fair value. Where the deferred consideration is contingent on the continued 
employment of the vendors, such arrangements are recognised in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income on a straight-line 
basis over the period of the arrangement.
(o) Share capital and share premium
Ordinary and deferred shares are classified as equity. The excess of consideration received in respect of shares issued over the nominal 
value of those shares is recognised in the share premium account. Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares or 
options are shown in equity as a deduction, net of tax, from the proceeds.
Where any Group company purchases the Company’s equity instruments, for example as the result of a share buyback or share-based 
payment plan, the consideration paid, including any directly attributable incremental costs (net of income taxes) is deducted from equity 
attributable to the owners of the Company as treasury shares until the shares are cancelled or reissued. Where such ordinary shares are 
subsequently reissued, any consideration received, net of any directly attributable incremental transaction costs and the related income tax 
effects, is included in equity attributable to the owners of the Company.
Shares held by the Centaur Employees’ Benefit Trust are disclosed as treasury shares and deducted from contributed equity. The Company 
also holds a non-distributable reserve representing the fair value of unvested share-based compensation plans.
(p) Dividends
Dividends are recognised in the period in which they are paid or, in respect of the Company’s final dividend for the year, approved by the 
Shareholders in the Annual General Meeting.
(q) Segmental reporting
Operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to the chief operating decision-maker. 
The Executive Committee has been identified as the chief operating decision-maker, responsible for allocating resources and assessing 
performance of the operating segments. The Group operates in three market-facing divisions: Marketing, Financial Services and 
Professional.
(r) Financial instruments
The Group has applied IFRS 7, Financial Instruments: Disclosures, and IAS 39, Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement, as 
outlined below:
(i) Financial assets
The Group classifies its financial assets in the following categories where relevant: at fair value through profit or loss; loans and receivables; 
and available-for-sale. The classification depends on the purpose for which the financial assets were acquired. Management determines the 
classification of its financial assets at initial recognition.
All of the Group’s financial assets have been classified as loans and receivables. Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets 
with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market. They are included in current assets, except for maturities 
greater than 12 months after the statement of financial position date. These are classified as non-current assets. The Group’s loans 
and receivables comprise trade and other receivables and cash and cash equivalents in the statement of financial position. Loans and 
receivables are carried at amortised cost using the effective interest method.

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
1 SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED
(ii) Trade receivables
Trade receivables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, less 
provision for impairment.
A provision for impairment of trade receivables is established when there is objective evidence that the Group will not be able to collect all 
amounts due according to the original terms of the receivables. Significant financial difficulties of the debtor, probability that the debtor will 
enter bankruptcy or financial reorganisation and default or delinquency in payments (more than 90 days overdue) are considered indicators 
that the trade receivable is impaired. The amount of the provision is the difference between the asset’s carrying amount and the present 
value of estimated future cash flows, discounted at the original effective interest rate. The carrying amount of the asset is reduced through 
the use of an allowance account, and the amount of the loss is recognised in the statement of comprehensive income within net operating 
expenses. When a trade receivable is uncollectible, it is written off against the allowance account for trade receivables. Subsequent 
recoveries of amounts previously written off are credited against net operating expenses in the statement of comprehensive income.
(iii) Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents includes cash in hand and deposits repayable on demand or maturing within three months of the statement of 
financial position date.
(iv) Financial liabilities
Debt and trade payables are recognised initially at fair value based on amounts exchanged, net of transaction costs, and subsequently at 
amortised cost. 
Interest expense on debt is accounted for using the effective interest method and is recognised in income.
(v) Trade payables
Trade payables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
(vi) Borrowings
Borrowings are initially recognised at fair value, net of transaction costs incurred and carried subsequently at amortised cost. Costs of 
borrowings are recognised in the statement of comprehensive income as incurred or, where appropriate, across the term of the related 
borrowing.
(vii) Derivative financial instruments
The Group does not hold derivative financial instruments either for trading purposes or designated as hedges.
(s) Key accounting assumptions, estimates and judgements
The preparation of financial statements under IFRS requires the use of certain key accounting assumptions and requires management to 
exercise its judgement and to make estimates. The areas where assumptions and estimates are significant to the consolidated financial 
statements are as follows:
(i) Carrying value of goodwill and other intangible assets
In assessing whether goodwill and other intangible fixed assets are impaired, the Group uses a discounted cash flow model which includes 
forecast cash flows and estimates of future growth. If the results of operations in future periods are lower than included in the cash flow 
model, impairments may be triggered. Further details of the assumptions and sensitivities in the discounted cash flow model are included in 
note 10.
Intangible assets arising on business combinations are identified based on the Group’s understanding of the acquired business and previous 
experience of similar businesses. Consistent methods of valuation for similar types of intangible asset are applied where possible and 
appropriate, using information reviewed at Board level where available. Discount rates applied in calculating the values of intangible assets 
arising on the acquisition of subsidiaries are calculated specifically for each acquisition, and adjusted to reflect the respective risk profile of 
each individual asset based on the Group’s past experience of similar assets.

STRATEGIC REPORT
www.centaurmedia.com
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(ii) Recoverability of trade receivables
The recoverability of trade receivables requires judgement. The Group uses all available evidence to determine the appropriate level of 
provision for impairment of trade receivables, including known disputes, historical trends in write-offs, collections post year end and 
the ageing of the receivables. Further details about trade receivables are included in note 18 and information about the credit risk and 
impairment of receivables are shown in note 29.
(iii) Adjusting items
The term ‘adjusted’ is not a defined term under IFRS. Judgement is required to ensure that the classification and presentation of certain 
items as adjusting, including exceptional items, is appropriate and consistent with the Group’s accounting policy. Further details about the 
amounts classified as adjusting are included in notes 1(b) and 4. 
(iv) Contingent consideration
The valuation of contingent consideration arising from business combinations (‘earn-out’ consideration) requires judgement, including 
assessing the probability and quantum of the expected payment. The Group uses all available information, including current and forecasted 
performance under earn-out arrangements to assess the required level of provision. Items relating to earn-out consideration are treated as 
an adjusting item under the Group’s accounting policy. Further details about the classification of earn-out consideration are included in notes 
1(b) and 4, and details of current and prior year earn-out arrangements and provisions are shown in notes 14 and 23.
(v) Share-based payments
The fair value of the share-based compensation expense recognised in the statement of comprehensive income requires the use of 
estimates. Details regarding the determination of fair value of these costs are set out in note 1(m)(ii).
(vi) Deferred tax
The calculation of deferred tax assets and liabilities requires judgement. Where the ultimate tax treatment is uncertain, the Group recognises 
deferred tax assets and liabilities based on estimates of future taxable income and recoverability. Where a change in circumstances occurs, 
or the final tax outcome is different from the amounts that were initially recorded, such differences will impact the income tax and deferred tax 
balances in the year in which that change or outcome is known. The accounting policy regarding deferred tax is set out above in note 1(g).
(vii) Valuation of intangibles
Intangible assets acquired in a business combination are required to be recognised separately from goodwill and amortised over their useful 
life. The Group has separately recognised computer software, brands and customer relationships in the acquisitions made (see note 14).
The fair value of these acquired intangibles is based on valuation techniques that require inputs based on assumptions about the future and 
estimates related to current market conditions.
The Group also makes assumptions about the useful life of the acquired intangibles as outlined in note 1(l)(iv).

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
2 SEGMENTAL REPORTING
The Executive Committee has been identified as the chief operating decision-maker, reviewing the Group’s internal reporting on a monthly 
basis in order to assess performance and allocate resources. 
The Group is organised around three reportable market-facing segments: Marketing, Financial Services and Professional. The Professional 
segment aggregates the Legal, Human Resources, Engineering and Travel & Meetings portfolios, which are deemed to have similar profiles 
of risk and return. All segments derive revenues from a combination of live events, premium content and advertising revenues. Corporate 
income and costs are allocated to these segments on an appropriate basis, depending on the nature of the costs, including in proportion to 
revenues or headcount. There is no inter-segmental revenue.
Segment assets consist primarily of property, plant and equipment, intangible assets including goodwill, inventories and trade receivables. 
Segment liabilities comprise trade payables, accruals and deferred income. 
Corporate assets and liabilities comprise current and deferred tax balances, cash and cash equivalents and borrowings.
Capital expenditure comprises additions to property, plant and equipment, intangible assets and includes additions resulting from 
acquisitions through business combinations.

Exceptional costs
Staff-related restructuring costs 
During 2017, exceptional restructuring costs of £0.2m were incurred as a result of the reorganisation of the Human Resources function and 
the exit from print. Whilst similar costs have been incurred previously, such costs linked to the Group’s transformation programme are not 
expected to recur once this is completed, and as such these costs are deemed to be exceptional in nature.
In 2016, exceptional restructuring costs of £0.9m were recognised as a result of restructuring activities and cost saving initiatives. 
Costs relating to strategic corporate restructuring initiatives
In the prior year, these costs related to professional fees for strategic corporate restructuring initiatives of £0.2m and non-trading costs 
arising on prior disposals of £0.1m.
Other adjusting items
Other adjusting items relate to the amortisation of acquired intangible assets (see note 11) and share-based payment costs (see note 26) as 
well as the items discussed below:
Earn-out consideration
In 2017, a charge of £0.6m has been recognised in relation to acquisition earn-out consideration for Oystercatcher. See note 14 for  
further details. 
The charge in 2016 of £0.6m also related to the Oystercatchers acquisition earn-out.
Costs relating to the acquisition of business
These costs relate to the acquisition of MarketMakers Incorporated Limited (‘MarketMakers’) (see note 14). These costs include stamp duty of 
£0.1m, sponsors’ fees of £0.1m, legal fees of £0.1m, due diligence and planning fees of £0.1m and various other professional fees of £0.2m.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Profit on disposal of subsidiary
On 1 August 2017, the Group sold its business-to-consumer division, the Home Interest segment, recognising a profit on disposal of 
£20.9m (see note 15 for more detail).
Additional impairment of trade receivables
In the prior year, an additional, separately reported charge was recognised in relation to impairment of trade receivables of £1.8m (£1.5m 
from continuing operations, £0.3m from discontinued operations). As a result of disruption during the second half of 2015 into the early 
part of 2016, arising from a new accounting system implementation in 2015, an amount of legacy and older debt remained unpaid at 
31 December 2016, which was significantly in excess of levels historically experienced by the Group. A detailed review and risk assessment 
to ascertain the recoverability of this debt was undertaken. This review, together with the fact that there was further extended ageing despite 
active pursuit of the amounts in 2016 meant the Group considered it necessary to provide against potentially uncollectible aged debt at 
levels in excess of those which would be required under normal trading conditions. The quantum of this additional provision arises from 
unique circumstances following an accounting system implementation, therefore the charge of £1.8m was separately reported in adjusting 
items. In addition, an ordinary charge of £0.5m was recorded in adjusted operating profit, which was not separately reported.
In 2017, no such additional charge is required.
Impairment of goodwill
During 2017, there was no impairment charge in relation to goodwill (2016: £7.2m impairment charge in relation to goodwill in the Financial 
Services segment).

9 EARNINGS PER SHARE
Basic earnings per share (‘EPS’) is calculated by dividing the earnings attributable to ordinary Shareholders by the weighted average number 
of shares in issue during the year. 91,191 (2016: 91,191) shares held in the employee benefit trust and 6,964,613 (2016: 6,870,437) shares 
held in treasury have been excluded in arriving at the weighted average number of shares.
For diluted earnings per share, the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue is adjusted to assume conversion of all potentially 
dilutive ordinary shares. This comprises share options and awards (including those granted under the share save plan) granted to Directors 
and employees where the exercise price is less than the average market price of the Company’s ordinary shares during the year.
Basic and diluted earnings per share have also been presented on an adjusted continuing and discontinued basis, as the Directors believe 
that this measure is more reflective of the underlying performance of the Group. These have been calculated as follows:

Goodwill by segment 
Each brand is deemed to be a Cash Generating Unit (‘CGU’), being the lowest level at which cash flows are separately identifiable. Goodwill is 
attributed to individual CGUs but is reviewed at the segment level for the purposes of the annual impairment review as this is the level at which 
management monitors goodwill. The majority of the Group’s goodwill arose on the acquisition of Centaur Communications Group in 2004.
Goodwill is allocated to segments as follows:

Impairment testing of goodwill and acquired intangible assets
During the period, goodwill and acquired intangible assets were tested for impairment in accordance with IAS 36. In assessing whether 
a write-down of goodwill and acquired intangible assets is required, the carrying value of the segment is compared with its recoverable 
amount. Recoverable amounts are measured based on value-in-use.
The Group estimates the value-in-use of its CGUs using a discounted cash flow model, which adjusts the cash flows for risks associated 
with the assets and discounts these using a pre-tax rate of 11.4% (2016: 12.6%). The discount rate used is consistent with the Group’s 
weighted average cost of capital and is used across all segments, which are all based predominantly in the UK and considered to have 
similar risks and rewards.

STRATEGIC REPORT
www.centaurmedia.com
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
The key assumptions used in calculating value-in-use are revenue growth, margin, adjusted EBITDA, discount rate and the terminal growth 
rate. The Group has used formally approved forecasts for the first three years of the calculation and applied a terminal growth rate of 2.0% 
(2016: 2.0%). This timescale and the terminal growth rate are both considered appropriate given the cyclical nature of the Group’s revenues.
The assumptions used in the calculations of value-in-use for each segment have been derived based on a combination of past experience 
and management’s expectations of future growth rates in the business.
At 31 December 2017, before impairment testing, goodwill of £48.9m, £21.6m and £5.1m was allocated to the Marketing, Professional 
and Financial Services segments respectively. In a ‘base case’ scenario, and in the sensitised scenarios outlined below, the value-in-use 
calculations exceed the carrying values and therefore no impairment to goodwill is indicated for any of the three segments.
Sensitivity analysis has been performed on the value-in-use calculations, holding all other variables constant, to:
(i) apply a 10% reduction to forecast adjusted EBITDA in each year of the modelled cash flows. No impairment would occur in any of the 
segments. 
(ii) apply a 2.0% increase in discount rate from 11.4% to 13.4%. No impairment would occur in any of the segments.
(iii) reduce the terminal value growth rate from 2.0% to 1.0%. No impairment would occur in any of the segments.

14 BUSINESS COMBINATION
On 2 August 2017, Centaur Communications Limited, a Group company, acquired 100% of the issued share capital of MarketMakers 
Incorporated Limited (‘MarketMakers’), a business-to-business (‘B2B’) telemarketing agency. This acquisition forms a significant aspect 
of Centaur’s transformation into a pure B2B-focused business. MarketMakers will provide a range of higher value-added products and 
services, and will allow Centaur to offer end-to-end lead generation management. The results of MarketMakers are included in the Marketing 
segment. Details of the purchase consideration, the net assets acquired and goodwill are as follows:

STRATEGIC REPORT

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Certain intangible assets have been separately identified on acquisition including brands of £0.8m, customer relationships of £3.6m, and the 
ERP platform of £0.7m. The fair value of the brands has been estimated using a relief from royalty approach, and the customer relationships 
and ERP platform have been valued using an excess earnings approach.
The useful economic life of the intangibles is as follows:
Intangible assets – Brands - 8 years
Intangible assets – Customer contracts and relationships - 3 to 4 years
Intangible assets – ERP platform – 5 years 
The goodwill is comprised of the deferred tax liability on the identified intangible assets, the acquired workforce and, in particular, the ability 
of the business to generate new customer relationships. 
Deferred consideration
£0.1m of deferred consideration is payable in cash upon completion of the Company tax return related to the year ended 31 December 
2017, subject to any claims made under the purchase agreement. £0.1m has been recognised in other liabilities in respect of this deferred 
consideration.
Contingent consideration
In the event that certain pre-determined EBITDA levels are achieved by MarketMakers for the year ended 31 December 2017, additional 
consideration of up to £3.6m may be payable in cash during the first quarter of 2018.
The potential undiscounted amount payable under the agreement is between £nil for EBITDA below £2.0m and £3.6m for EBITDA above 
£2.5m. The fair value of the contingent consideration is undiscounted as the payment is due in less than one year from the acquisition date.
Acquired receivables
The fair value of acquired trade receivables is £2.3m. The gross contractual amount for trade receivables due is £2.3m, all of which is 
expected to be collectible.
Revenue and profit contribution
MarketMakers contributed revenues of £6.1m and net profit of £1.1m to the Group for the period from 2 August 2017 to 31 December 
2017. If the acquisition had occurred on 1 January 2017, MarketMakers pro forma revenue and operating profit for the year ended 31 
December 2017 would have been £13.9m and £2.1m respectively. 
Acquisition costs
Costs relating to the acquisition of MarketMakers amounted to £0.6m (see note 4). These costs include stamp duty of £0.1m, sponsors’ 
fees of £0.1m, legal fees of £0.1m, due diligence and planning fees of £0.1m and various other professional fees of £0.2m.
Prior year business combination
In the prior year, Centaur Communications Limited, a Group company, acquired the business and assets of The Oystercatchers LLP 
(‘Oystercatchers’), a specialist marketing consultancy. The results of Oystercatchers are included in the Marketing segment. The £1.1m 
net identifiable assets of Oystercatchers were acquired for total purchase consideration of £2.3m, resulting in the recognition of £1.2m of 
goodwill. The consideration comprised a mixture of cash and shares, including deferred consideration of £0.2m that has been fully settled in 
cash in the current year. 
At 31 December 2016, and under the sales purchase agreement, there was contingent consideration (earn-out consideration) of £1.2m to 
be settled in cash 75% and shares 25%. In the prior year, an expense and a provision of £0.4m was recognised under IAS 19 (for the cash 
element) and an expense and credit to equity of £0.2m was recognised under IFRS 2 (for the share-based payment element). During the 
period a further expense and provision of £0.4m was recognised under IAS 19 (for the cash element) and an expense and credit to equity 
of £0.2m under IFRS 2 (for the share-based payment element). The total amount of £1.2m was settled wholly in cash during the year and 
therefore an adjustment of £0.4m (£0.2m current year and £0.2m prior year) was made to reverse the share-based payment element under 
IFRS 2 and account for the whole transaction under IAS 19 appropriately. 
Further details of this acquisition can be found in note 13 of the Group’s Annual Report and financial statements for the year ended 
31 December 2016.

Deferred consideration
Deferred consideration at 31 December 2016 related to the acquisition of Oystercatchers. Under the sales purchase agreement, the 
contingent consideration was to be settled in cash 75% and shares 25%. In the prior year, an expense and a provision of £0.4m was 
recognised under IAS 19 (for the cash element) and an expense and credit to equity of £0.2m was recognised under IFRS 2 (for the share-
based payment element).
During the year, a further expense and provision of £0.4m was recognised under IAS 19 (for the cash element) and an expense and credit to 
equity of £0.2m under IFRS 2 (for the share-based payment element).
Per agreement with the former Oystercatchers Shareholders, the total amount of £1.2m was wholly settled in cash during the year and 
therefore an adjustment of £0.2m was made to reverse the share-based payment element recognised in the year under IFRS 2 and account 
for the charge under IAS 19, appropriately resulting in a total charge of £0.6m. A transfer was made for the total share-based payment 
amount of £0.3m held in non-distributable reserves in equity to provisions netting off against the payment made to settle the liability.
Deferred consideration at 31 December 2017 relates to the acquisition of MarketMakers Incorporated Limited (‘MarketMakers’) and is 
payable within 1 year (see note 14). The amount payable is dependent on achieving pre-determined EBITDA levels and has been treated as 
contingent consideration. All amounts represent the Directors’ best estimate of the balance to be paid at the statement of financial position 
date, based on information available at the acquisition date.
Other 
A dilapidation provision was acquired on the acquisition of MarketMakers in relation to the building leased by the Company in Portsmouth. 
The lease expires in December 2022 and therefore the provision is classified as a non-current liability.

The deferred shares reserve represents 800,000 (2016: 800,000) deferred shares of 10p each, which carry restricted voting rights and have 
no right to receive a dividend payment in respect of any financial year. 
Reserve for shares to be issued
The reserve for shares to be issued is in respect of equity-settled share-based compensation plans. The changes to the reserve for shares to

for under IFRS 2.
Own shares reserve
The own shares reserve represents the value of shares held as treasury shares and in an employee benefit trust. At 31 December 2017,

employee benefit trust.
During 2017, the Company purchased 97,176 (2016: 397,447) ordinary shares to be held in treasury in order to meet future obligations 
arising from share-based rewards to employees. The buyback programme was approved by Shareholders at the Annual General Meeting 
held on 9 May 2017 up to a value of £1.0m. The shares were acquired at an average price of 53.58p (2016: 42.75p) per share, with prices 
ranging from 46p to 55p. The total cost of £0.1m (2016: £0.2m) has been recognised in other reserves in the own shares reserve in equity.

Long Term Incentive Plan
The Group operates a Long Term Incentive Plan (‘LTIP’) for Executive Directors and selected senior management. This is an existing 
incentive policy and was approved by Shareholders at the 2006 AGM. The share awards are valued at date of grant and the consolidated 
statement of comprehensive income is charged over the vesting period, taking into account the number of shares expected to vest.
Full details of how the scheme operates are included in the Directors’ Remuneration Report. These awards were priced using the following

2014 Retention Plan
The 2014 Retention Plan was introduced in June 2014 and is now closed to new participants. Awards vested over a period of two or three 
years, with the only condition being continued employment. Awards were granted under this scheme in 2014 for no consideration and no 
exercise price. The Retention Plan did not result in the issue of any new ordinary shares as this plan was not approved by Shareholders. The 
awards were settled from the shares held in the Employee Benefit Trust during 2016.
Senior Executive Long-Term Incentive Plan (‘SELTIP’)
The Centaur Media Plc 2010 Senior Executive Long-Term Incentive Plan (the ‘SELTIP’) was introduced during 2011 and was approved by 
Shareholders at the 2010 AGM. This is not an HMRC approved scheme and vests over a three year period with service and performance 
conditions. Awards were granted under this scheme in 2011 for no consideration and no exercise price. This scheme has closed to new 
awards.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Share Incentive Plan
The Group has a Share Incentive Plan, which is an HRMC approved Tax-Advantaged plan, which provides employees with the opportunity 
to purchase shares in the Company. This plan is open to all employees who have been employed by the Group for more than 12 months. 
Employees may invest up to £1,800 per annum (or 10% of their salary if less) in ordinary shares in the Company, which are held in trust. 
The shares are purchased in open market and are held in trust for each employee. The shares can be withdrawn with tax paid at any time, 
or tax-free after five years. The Group matches the contribution with a ratio of one share for every two purchased. Other than continuing 
employment, there are no other performance conditions attached to the plan. 
The Executive Directors are eligible to participate in the Share Incentive Plan, as are all employees of the Group.

Number of outstanding matching shares 57,532 27,727
Deferred contingent consideration
In the prior year, the Group acquired The Oystercatchers LLP on 30 September 2016 (grant date) which included deferred contingent 
consideration to be partly settled by shares in the Group. The total consideration payable in shares was up to the maximum value of £0.3m 
to be issued at the share price on the settlement date. The total cost was spread over the vesting period from 1 October 2016 to 31 March 
2017 and a charge of £0.2m was recognised in the statement of comprehensive income and equity during the prior year. The fair value of 
the share-based payment was deemed to be the maximum value of consideration payable. See note 14.
During the year a charge of £0.2m was recognised in the statement of comprehensive income and equity. The total deferred contingent 
consideration was settled wholly in cash during the year and therefore an adjustment was made to reverse the current year charge of £0.2m 
from share-based payments under IFRS 2 and recognised as employee compensation under IAS 19. A further adjustment was made to 
reallocate the total amount charged to equity in both years of £0.3m to provisions. See note 14.

29 FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT
Financial risk management
The Board has overall responsibility for the determination of the Group’s risk management policies. The Board receives monthly reports from 
the Chief Financial Officer through which it reviews the effectiveness of policies and processes put in place to manage risk. The Board sets 
policies that reduce risk as far as possible without unduly affecting the operating effectiveness of the Group.
The Group’s activities expose it to a variety of financial risks, including interest rate risk, credit risk, liquidity risk, capital risk and currency risk. 
Of these, credit risk and liquidity risk are considered the most significant. This note presents information about the Group’s exposure to each 
of the above risks.
Categories of financial instruments
Details of the significant accounting policies and methods adopted, including the criteria for recognition, the basis of measurement and the 
basis on which income and expenses are recognised in respect of each class of financial asset, financial liability and equity instrument are 
disclosed in note 1(r). All financial assets and liabilities are measured at amortised cost.

Credit risk
The Group’s principal financial assets are trade and other receivables (note 18) and cash and cash equivalents. Credit risk refers to the risk 
that a counterparty will default on its contractual obligations resulting in financial loss to the Group. The carrying amount of financial assets 
recorded in the financial statements, which is net of impairment losses, represents the Group’s maximum exposure to credit risk in relation to 
financial assets. Credit risk is managed on a Group basis. The Group does not consider that it is subject to any significant concentrations of 
credit risk.
Trade receivables 
Trade receivables consist of a large number of customers, of varying sizes and spread across diverse industries and geographies. The 
Group does not have significant exposure to credit risk in relation to any single counterparty or group of counterparties having similar 
characteristics. The Group’s exposure to credit risk is influenced predominantly by the circumstances of individual customers as opposed to 
industry or geographic trends.
The business assesses the credit quality of customers based on their financial position, past experience and other qualitative and 
quantitative factors. The Group’s policy requires customers to pay in accordance with agreed payment terms, which are generally 30 days 
from the date of invoice. Under normal trading conditions, the Group is exposed to relatively low levels of risk, and potential losses are 
mitigated as a result of a diversified customer base and the requirement for events and certain premium content subscription invoices to be 
paid in advance of service delivery.
The credit control function within the Group’s finance department monitors the outstanding debts of the Group, and trade receivables 
balances are analysed by the age and value of outstanding balances.

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
29 FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT CONTINUED
Any trade receivable balance which is objectively determined to be uncollectible is written off the ledger, with a charge taken through 
the statement of comprehensive income. The Group also records a provision for estimated impairment losses on its trade receivables 
balances. All balances past due are reviewed, with those greater than 90 days past due considered to carry a higher level of credit risk. 
Specific provision is made against customer balances with known credit issues or where debt has been referred to a collection agency. The 
remaining past due balances are then analysed, with balances relating to revenue recognised in advance, customers on payment plans 
and non-payment resulting from administrative queries considered to be of lower risk. A judgement is applied to the net balance based on 
historic experience on a percentage basis, taking into account both the age and the reason items remain unpaid. 
Impairment losses are taken through administrative expenses in the statement of comprehensive income.
The ageing of trade receivables according to their original due date is detailed below:

Over 90 days past due 1.6 (1.5) 4.1 (2.5)
  10.5 (1.5) 15.8 (2.7)
Trade receivables that are less than 3 months past due are generally not considered to be impaired, except where specific credit issues 
or delinquency in payments have been identified. At 31 December 2017, there are debtors greater than 90 days past due with a carrying 
value of £0.1m (2016: £1.6m) which have not been provided against. In making the assessment that these amounts are not impaired, the 
Directors have considered the quantum of amounts included in gross trade receivables which relate to amounts not yet included in income, 
including pre-event debt included in deferred income and amounts relating to VAT. The credit quality of trade receivables not yet due nor 
impaired has been assessed as acceptable.

The Group’s policy requires customers to pay in accordance with agreed payment terms, which are generally 30 days from the date of 
invoice or, in the case of live events related revenue, no less than 30 days before the event. All credit and recovery risk associated with trade 
receivables has been provided for in the statement of financial position. The Group’s policy for recognising an impairment loss is given in 
note 1. Impairment losses are taken through administrative expenses in the statement of comprehensive income.
The Directors consider the carrying value of trade and other receivables approximates to their fair value.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Cash and cash equivalents
Banks and financial institutions are independently rated by credit rating agencies. We choose only to deal with those with a minimum ‘A’ 
rating. We determine the credit quality for cash and cash equivalents to be strong.
Other receivables
Other receivables are neither past due nor impaired. These are primarily made up of sundry receivables, including employee-related debtors 
and receivables in respect of distribution arrangements.
Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due. During the year, the Group was in a 
net borrowings position until the end of July, from which time through to 31 December 2017, the Group maintained a net cash position. The 
Group manages liquidity risk by maintaining adequate reserves and working capital credit facilities, and by continuously monitoring forecast 
and actual cash flows. The total facility available to the Group is £25.0m and is available through to August 2019. As at 31 December 2017, 
the Group had cash of £4.1m (2016: £3.4m) with a full undrawn loan facility of £25.0m (2016: undrawn loan facilities of £7.5m).

The Directors consider that book value is materially equal to fair value.
The book value of primary financial instruments approximates to fair value where the instrument is on a short maturity or where they bear 
interest at rates that approximate to the market.
All trade and other payables are due in one year or less, or on demand. 
Interest rate risk
The Group has no significant interest-bearing assets but is exposed to interest rate risk when it borrows funds at floating interest rates 
through its revolving credit facility. Borrowings issued at variable rates expose the Group to cash flow interest rate risk. The Group evaluates 
its risk appetite towards interest rate risks regularly, and may undertake hedging activities, including interest rate swap contracts, to manage 
interest rate risk in relation to its revolving credit facility if deemed necessary. 
The Group did not enter into any hedging transactions during the current or prior year and, as at 31 December 2017, the only floating rate 
to which the Group is exposed was LIBOR. The Group’s exposure to interest rates on financial assets and financial liabilities is detailed in the

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
29 FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT CONTINUED
Interest rate sensitivity
The Group has exposure to interest rate risk, and sensitivity analysis has been performed based on exposure to variable interest rates at the 
reporting date.
If interest rates had been 50 basis points higher or lower and all other variables were held constant, the Group’s net profit after tax would 
increase / decrease by an insignificant amount.
Capital risk 
The Group manages its capital to ensure that all entities in the Group will be able to continue as a going concern while maximising return to 
stakeholders, as well as sustaining the future development of the business.
The capital structure of the Group consists of net debt/cash, which includes borrowings (note 24) and cash and cash equivalents (note 19), 
and equity attributable to the owners of the parent, comprising issued share capital (note 25), other reserves and retained earnings. The 
Board also considers the levels of own shares held for employee share schemes, and the ability to issue new shares for acquisitions, in 
managing capital risk in the business.
The Group continues to benefit from its banking facilities (as renewed during June 2015), which features both a working capital facility, to 
assist in managing the Group’s liquidity risk, and an acquisition facility to support the Group’s acquisition strategy. The facility, available until 
August 2019, allows for a maximum drawdown of £25m. 
Interest is calculated on LIBOR plus a margin dependent on the Group’s net leverage position, which is remeasured quarterly in line with 
covenant testing. The Group’s borrowings are subject to financial covenants tested quarterly. The principal financial covenants under the 
facility are that the ratio of net debt to adjusted EBITDA (see note 1(b) for explanation and reconciliation of adjusted EBITDA) shall not 
exceed 2.5:1 and the ratio of EBITDA to net finance charges shall not be less than 4:1. At 31 December 2017, and throughout 2017, all of 
these covenants were achieved.
Currency risk
Substantially all of the Group’s net assets are located in the United Kingdom. The majority of revenue and profits is generated in the United 
Kingdom and consequently foreign exchange risk is limited. The Group continues to monitor its exposure to currency risk, particularly as 
the business expands into overseas territories such as North America, however the results of the Group are not currently considered to be 
sensitive to movements in currency rates.
