Forward-looking statements 
The Annual Report and Accounts contains certain 
forward-looking statements with regard to the 
operations, performance and financial condition of the 
Group. By their nature, these statements involve 
uncertainty since future events and circumstances can 
cause results to differ materially from those anticipated. 
The forward-looking statements reflect knowledge and 
information available at the date of preparation of this 
Annual Report and Accounts and the Company 
undertakes no obligation to update these forward-
looking statements. Nothing contained in this Annual 
Report and Accounts should be construed as a profit 
forecast. This report is intended to provide information 
to shareholders, is not designed to be relied upon by any 
other party or for any other purpose, and the Company 
and its directors accept no liability to any other person 
other than that required under English law.
TO FLY
Expertise relied upon by 
customers to enable safe and 
cost effective flight
We balance weight, life span, life-cycle cost, dispatchability, ease of maintenance, short field 
performance and turnaround times to deliver the optimal combination of technical performance and 
operating economics needed for a given aircraft. With decades of experience, an extensive intellectual 
property portfolio and positions on some of the world’s most technologically advanced civil and military 
aircraft, Meggitt plays a critical role in enabling safe and cost effective landings for over 15 million flights 
each year.
TO POWER
Products and services which  
enable customers to reliably 
operate critical infrastructure 
without disruption
Meggitt health monitoring systems are installed on energy infrastructure across the globe, including the 
world’s tallest gravity dam at Grand Dixence, Switzerland. Highly durable sensors placed close to critical 
pieces of equipment relay information on everything from vibration anomalies to electrical currents back 
to a central computer system. By inspecting patterns within the signals, analysts can easily see if their 
equipment is in peak condition or in need of maintenance. Because any potential problems show up early 
on, engineers can schedule physical inspections and repairs for optimal times, when energy demand is 
low. Most important, health monitoring avoids catastrophic failures, potentially saving billions of pounds.
TO LIVE
Innovative technologies which  
make the world more secure
Meggitt is the leading provider of fuel tanks to the US military. Before our crashworthy fuel tanks, over 
42% of survivable helicopter crashes in the US resulted in deaths from fuel fires. Today, Meggitt’s 
crashworthy, self-seal fuel tanks, which meet rigorous standards for flexibility, strength, impact and cut-
and-tear resistance have stopped fuel spillage and reduced fire-related death and injury in such crashes 
to almost zero. If punctured by a high impact explosive 23mm bullet, Meggitt’s ballistically-resistant fuel 
bladders will self-seal in less than two minutes. The wound is encased in a rubber gel, which suppresses 
the ignition source, stops fuel leakage and enables flight crews to return safely to their home base. STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE OTHER INFORMATION

DRIVING VALUE 
CREATION
Chairman’s statement
growing customer programmes and build 
further capacity for growth.
Our second priority is to grow our ordinary 
dividend in line with earnings through the 
cycle. Over the past five years we have 
grown our dividend by 6.1% p.a, during a 
period of significant reinvestment. During 
this period, we have delivered free cash 
flow of more than 140% of our dividend, 
demonstrating the cash generative nature 
of our business model.
Reflecting the continued confident 
outlook for the medium term, the Board 
is proposing a 5% increase to the full year 
dividend to 15.85p per share for 2017  
(2016: 15.10p per share).
With products installed on over 69,000 civil 
and military aircraft, increased content on 
new aircraft and consistent growth in air 
travel, Meggitt is well positioned for growth 
over the medium to long term.
Having passed the peak of investment 
in research and development, the focus 
of the business is now on building the 
capability and capacity to deliver these new 
programmes to our customers and driving 
operational efficiencies that will enhance 
our competitiveness and accelerate growth 
in shareholder returns.
Capital Allocation
To deliver this sustainable growth in 
shareholder returns over the medium to 
long term, the Board has outlined a series of 
priorities for capital allocation. 
Our first priority is investing in the organic 
growth and operational efficiency of the 
business. In 2017, we have continued to 
make significant investments to develop 
new technologies, fund our participation in 
In last year’s report I talked about the significant increases in 
content Meggitt had secured on new generation aircraft 
during a period of unprecedented product renewal by the 
major airframe and engine manufacturers. As we mostly 
supply products as a sole source provider, we are the only 
provider of spare parts on these platforms that will be in 
operation for decades to come.
Dividend growth p.a. over 5 yrs
6.1
%
Our third priority is to target value accretive 
acquisitions in attractive markets where we 
have or can develop a strong competitive 
position. The Board meets regularly to review 
the Group’s strategy and has a clear view 
on the areas of capability we should grow by 
acquisition. This list is refined on an annual 
basis and potential targets are assessed 
against a rigorous set of criteria including 
both financial metrics and more qualitative 
assessments, including cultural fit.
Finally, in the absence of any compelling 
investment opportunities for a prolonged 
period, our fourth priority is to maintain 
an efficient balance sheet in line with the 
Board’s guideline range of 1.5x to 2.5x Net 
debt:EBITDA
1
, designed to ensure clear 
headroom against our covenants. 
Board Changes
In November, we announced that Stephen 
Young would step down from the Board 
and his role as Chief Executive in December 
2017 before retiring in April 2018. Stephen 
has served as our Chief Executive for  
five years and prior to that, for nine years as 
Finance Director. During this 14 year period, 
Group revenue grew fivefold, profitability 
increased by nearly 460% and total 
shareholder returns grew by 420%. We 
thank Stephen for the significant role he has 
played in the development of the Group and 
we wish him well in his retirement.
Stephen has been succeeded by Tony Wood 
who joined Meggitt in December 2016 as 
Chief Operating Officer. With over 30 years of 
experience in senior aerospace roles, both at 
Rolls-Royce and Safran, Tony brings a wealth 
of industry knowledge, skills and extensive 
operational experience that will make him 
an excellent successor. Further details on 
the process to appoint Tony is included in 
the Nominations Committee report on page 
69. As reported last year, Nancy Gioia joined 
the Board in April 2017, replacing Brenda 
Reichelderfer who retired after serving six 
years as a Non-Executive Director.
People
I was pleased to be able to visit a number 
of our sites in 2017 and I continue to be 
impressed by the skills and commitment our 
employees demonstrate. This, combined 
with our specialist capabilities and leading 
positions in our core markets, is at the centre 
of everything we do. I would like to thank all of 
our employees for their hard work this year. 
In 2018, I will ensure the Board continues 
to focus on culture, inclusion, diversity 
and employee engagement, in support of 
executive management’s ambition for Meggitt 
to be an employer of choice.

Chief Executive
Chief Executive’s statement
Meggitt is a leading provider of smart engineering for 
extreme environments. We invest in technologies and 
capabilities that enable our customers to develop 
aircraft, gas turbines and other complex equipment 
that has to perform in challenging conditions.
Over the last few years, investment in our 
portfolio has enabled us to significantly 
increase the number and value of Meggitt 
parts on new platforms that will drive growth 
for decades. We have focused on: improving 
the service we offer to our customers 
including the formation of our Customer 
Services and Support (‘CSS’) organisation; 
enhancing our competitiveness, through 
the deployment of the Meggitt Production 
System (‘MPS’); and building a high 
performance culture, capable of delivering 
superior returns for shareholders over the 
medium term.
Portfolio
In 2017, Meggitt technologies have played a 
critical role in enabling the first flights of new 
aircraft such as the Embraer E2, Comac C919 
and Saab Gripen-E; and the entry into service 
of important new platforms including the 
Boeing 737MAX and Airbus A321neo. Having 
increased our content on these platforms 
compared to their predecessors, these 
milestones represent an important step on 
our journey to increased growth.
To enable us to increase share even further 
on the next generation of aircraft, we have 
continued to prioritise investment in applied 
research and technology, focusing on 
those areas where we expect both market 
demand and our competitive position to be 
strong. One such example is research into 
advanced thermal systems for ultra-high 
bypass engines, where we have secured a UK 
Government grant of £3.7m to build on our 
deep capability in aerospace heat exchangers. 
We have also prioritised investment in 
advanced manufacturing technologies 
such as our Meggitt Modular Modifiable 
Manufacturing (M
4
) initiative and investments 
in additive manufacturing for aerospace 
applications.
To supplement this focus on technologies 
where we have strong competitive positions 
in attractive markets, we announced a series 
of divestments in 2017, which materially 
reduced our exposure to non-core industrial 
markets where the technology requirements, 
route to market and operational dynamics are 
very different to our core aerospace business. 
In June 2017, we completed the sale of Piher 
Sensors & Controls, Piezo Technologies and 
Meggitt Maryland to Amphenol Corporation. In 
November 2017, we reached an agreement to 
sell Thomson Aerospace & Defence to Umbra 
Cuscinetti which is expected to complete 
in March 2018, once customary regulatory 
clearances are received. In January 2018, 
we sold Aviation Mobility to Smart Carte. In 
aggregate, these businesses generated a total 
of £54m of revenue during 2017.
Customers
We continued to enhance our ability to 
support our customers with CSS now in its 
second full year of operation. During 2017, 
CSS has secured a number of new contracts 
to support airlines including Emirates, 
Air France and Vietjet. It has broadened 
partnerships with MRO integrators such 
as Lufthansa Technik. And it has secured a 
series of new distribution agreements with 
providers such as Aviall and Proponent. 
At the same time, we have continued to 
evolve our organisation, moving more 
aftermarket activity into our regional hubs in 
the US, UK and Singapore; and enhancing our 
capabilities in areas such as surplus trading. 
To serve our customers better and accelerate 
growth, we acquired Elite Aerospace in 
March 2017 which, when fully integrated into 
our aftermarket hub in Miami in 2018, will 
extend our capability in repair and overhaul 
of heat transfer, pneumatics and hydraulic 
components for commercial and military 
aircraft. 
Such progress is critical as we continue 
to focus on protecting and growing our 
share of Meggitt spares and repairs whilst 
realising the full value of our significant and 
growing installed base, which we have further 
enhanced during the year with a number of 
new OE contract awards. The most notable 
of these is a dual source contract to provide 
wheels and brakes for the Airbus A321neo.

MEGGITT PLC 9 Annual Report and Accounts 2017
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS GOVERNANCE StrategIc r ep Ort
This strategically significant contract for 
Meggitt, enables us to further demonstrate 
our capability in the large jet market, after 
the entry into service of the Bombardier 
CSeries in 2016 equipped with our Ebrake
TM 
technology, the industry’s second fully electric 
braking system.
In 2017, we have written off an investment 
of £59.5m following Dassault’s cancellation 
of its Falcon 5X programme due to ongoing 
problems related to its Silvercrest engine. 
Programme cancellations are a rare event in 
the aerospace industry. However, Dassault 
has announced its intention to develop a 
replacement Falcon with an alternative engine 
and we are hopeful we will retain our position 
on the successor aircraft. 
Competitiveness
In 2017, MPS – our global approach to 
continuous improvement – has continued to 
go from strength to strength. It was launched 
in 2013 to create a sustainable quality and 
delivery culture that drives competitive 
advantage beyond our technical expertise and 
enables the Group to deliver a higher rate of 
organic growth over the long term. 
In its fifth year, 12 (of our 48) sites have 
now entered the fourth, or bronze, stage of 
MPS where the focus turns to realising the 
financial benefits from improved productivity 
and lower inventories. In 2017, our focus on 
inventory reduction resulted in inventory 
turns increasing from 2.30 to 2.43 and £16m 
of cash being released from working capital. 
As we continue to move more of our sites into 
and beyond the bronze stage over the coming 
years, we expect MPS to make a material 
contribution to the targets we have set for 
margin improvement and cash generation.
During the year, we secured a number 
of supply agreements for important 
commodities such as electronics, fasteners 
and machining and we have invested in our 
Group purchasing organisation to more 
rapidly deploy these agreements in 2018 to 
leverage economies of scale, aligned to our 
target of achieving a net 2% reduction in 
purchased costs each year.
We have also taken a number of important 
steps to rationalise our footprint by 20% by 
2021. In November 2017, we commenced 
consultation ahead of a proposal to 
consolidate a range of manufacturing, 
engineering and support operations into a 
single centre of excellence at Ansty Park in 
Rugby, UK. This £130m total investment, 
developed in conjunction with partners, will 
see a state of the art manufacturing campus 
become operational by late 2019, serving 
as a hub for next generation innovation and 
acting as a catalyst for world-class operational 
performance.
Moving more work into larger, more 
capable sites is a key component of our 
site rationalisation strategy. It enables us to 
eliminate some of the fixed costs required 
to run individual aerospace sites but also 
provides better leverage of investment in 
world class infrastructure that will increase 
efficiency and improve customer service. 
Culture
In 2017, we launched a culture development 
programme which has now been deployed to 
over 800 of our leaders, aimed at fostering 
more effective collaboration and teamwork 
across the Group and to increase employee 
engagement. Talent has also been a key 
priority during the year, with a number of 
significant new hires during 2017. On the 
Executive Committee alone, four of our 
twelve most senior executives are in new or 
expanded roles and a further three are new to 
Meggitt. 
This focus on talent and culture, together 
with our other key priorities, will enable us 
to accelerate the pace of execution which 
remains critical to delivering growth and 
achieving the medium term targets we have 
outlined for margin improvement and cash 
generation.
Performance
Reported revenue increased by 2% to 
£2,027m, with growth from favourable 
currency translation offset by divestments 
completed within the year. Organic growth 
of 2% was in line with our expectations, 
including civil growth of 4%. Underlying 
earnings per share increased by 1% to 35.3p 
(2016: 34.8p), while net debt to EBITDA at the 
end of the year was 1.9x (2016: 2.1x).
Within civil aerospace, original equipment 
revenue grew organically by 3%, with 
increased shipset content on large jets 
offsetting a decline in regional and business 
jets. Aftermarket revenue increased 
organically by 6%, with strong performance 
in large jets and business aviation offsetting 
a flat performance in regional jets where 
de-stocking in the first six months inhibited 
growth.
Military revenues recovered well in the fourth 
quarter, after some delays to cash flowing 
from increased budgets in the US during the 
first nine months. Organic revenue growth 
of 1%, reflected good demand for original 
equipment, particularly on F-35 offsetting 
lower demand for spares on platforms 
including Typhoon, F-16 and Apache. 
As anticipated, energy revenues continued to 
decline with revenues in the Heatric business 
lower than in 2016, when it completed the 
last of its orders to support large capital 
projects in offshore gas applications. The 
power generation part of our energy business 
also declined as a result of lower demand for 
industrial gas turbines during the year. Overall 
energy revenues declined by 8% organically 
during the year. 
Underlying operating margin increased 
by 10 basis points to 19.2%, with the 
financial benefits from strategic initiatives 
partly offset by headwinds from mix and 
depreciation & amortisation together with 
growth in new product introduction costs at 
Meggitt Polymers & Composites (for more 
information see page 27).
Outlook
The outlook for our civil markets is 
encouraging despite continued delays 
to some civil aircraft programmes. In the 
medium term, production of large jets 
is expected to continue to grow and our 
increased shipsets on the latest generation of 
aircraft supports a positive outlook for civil OE 
revenues. In 2018, we expect civil OE to grow 
organically by 2 to 4%.
Available seat kilometres, an important driver 
of our large jet aftermarket, continue to grow 
well above the long-term trend of 5% per 
annum. This, combined with an improving 
outlook for take-offs and landings of regional 
and business jets and our increased share 
on new generation aircraft, signals that we 
will outgrow the market for civil spares in 
the medium term. In 2018, we expect civil 
aftermarket revenue to grow organically by 
3 to 5%.
In military, a growing defence budget in the 
US combined with good positions on the 
fastest growing and hardest worked aircraft 
platforms, means we are well positioned 
for growth over the medium term. In 2018, 
we anticipate organic growth of 3 to 5% in 
military, underpinned by growth of 4% in 
orders in 2017 (book to bill of 1.08).
In energy, we expect to see some recovery 
after a number of years of declining organic 
revenue driven principally by challenging 
market conditions at the Heatric business. A 
strong fourth quarter at Heatric, which grew 
year on year, for the first time since Q1 2014, 
underpins our expectation of a recovery 
in 2018. With benign conditions in power 
generation and an improving outlook in oil and 
gas markets, we expect our energy revenues 
to grow organically by 0 to 5% in 2018.
On the basis of the above, the Group expects 
overall 2 to 4% organic revenue growth in 
2018, and that this growth momentum will 
accelerate over the medium term. 
Having increased margin by 10 basis points in 
2017, the Group expects further improvement 
driven by the growing momentum in our 
strategic initiatives and is targetting a 10 to 40 
basis point improvement in 2018, before the 
impact of IFRS 15. Under IFRS 15, the Group 
expects a 30 basis point headwind from the 
accelerated growth in free of charge OE parts 
which would equate to a target for 2018 of 
17.7% to 18.0% (compared to 17.9% in 2017 
under IFRS 15).
We estimate free of charge shipsets will add 
an incremental 60 basis points headwind 
to margin between 2017 and 2021 and have 
restated our medium term margin target to 
reflect this change in accounting. We now 
expect to deliver a margin improvement of 
at least 200 basis points by 2021, which is 
consistent with our target to achieve a 200 
to 250 basis point improvement prior to the 
adoption of IFRS 15.

INVESTMENT CYCLE 
DEVELOPMENT
Investing in our customers’ competitiveness
As our products require significant cash investments during the technology 
development phases of new programmes, we only commit to those offering visible, 
worthwhile returns. These are typically characterised by sole-source contracts 
for the life of programmes and platforms backed by established original equipment 
manufacturers targeting clear, addressable markets and with ambitious investment 
plans of their own.
PRODUCTION
Revenues start
Revenue is usually generated when a programme moves into production. For 
civil aircraft, production of any one platform can last for up to ten years before it 
is replaced. Military and industrial equipment is manufactured over much longer 
periods. 
MATURITY
Revenues gain momentum
As our products age, they require maintenance or replacement at varying intervals 
based on condition. This drives demand for spare parts and repair services over 
product lifecycles that can extend to over thirty years. Spare parts are priced to 
reflect the investment made during the development phase and as such, the maturity 
phase is typified by strong positive cash flows.

Market review
Meggitt’s core civil aerospace, military and energy markets share a 
common requirement for smart engineering for extreme environments. 
These mission and safety critical components and sub-systems must 
perform to exacting requirements for many years in highly demanding 
operating conditions. Suppliers must be capable of meeting rigorous 
certification. The environments in which many of our products operate 
result in high levels of wear and tear and demand for spares and repairs. 
This drives aftermarket revenues for decades after initial product delivery.
CIVIL AEROSPACE
Civil aerospace accounts for 54% of Group 
revenue, with products and sub-systems 
installed on almost every jet airliner, 
regional aircraft and business jet in service. 
The global fleet has grown significantly in 
recent years, totalling over 47,000 aircraft 
compared with 31,000 a decade ago. New 
aircraft deliveries drive sales of original 
equipment. Aircraft utilisation generates 
demand for spare parts and repairs. The 
growth of our fleet, therefore, is a strong 
indication of future aftermarket revenue. 
The split of civil revenue, is 58% aftermarket 
and 42% original equipment (OE). 
ORIGINAL EQUIPMENT
Meggitt operates in three main segments 
of the civil aerospace market: large jets, 
regional aircraft and business jets. The 
large jet fleet includes over 22,000 aircraft, 
the regional aircraft fleet over 6,000 and 
business jets around 19,000. The Group has 
products on virtually all these platforms and 
hence a very large, and growing, installed 
base. 
We classify civil aircraft by seat capacity: 
large jets (>100 seats), regional aircraft 
(<100 seats) and business jets. Large jet 
deliveries in 2017 stood at a record 1,506, 
4% higher than in 2016. Growth in new 
deliveries of an average 5% per annum to 
2021 is driven by demand for large jets. This 
is underpinned by the order books of Boeing 
and Airbus, the two major civil aircraft 
manufacturers, which extend to between 
five and eight years based on forecast 
production rates. Other manufacturers 
investing in large jets include Bombardier, 
Irkut and COMAC. 
Deliveries of new aircraft have grown at 
an average of 5% per annum over the last 
five years. This has been influenced by 
high oil prices, the low cost of debt and 
newer, more advanced aircraft coming to 
market. Offering greater fuel efficiency, 
lower maintenance costs and quicker 
gate turnaround times, Boeing’s 737MAX, 
Airbus’ A320neo and the CSeries from 
Bombardier enable operators to reduce 
operating costs.
Regional aircraft deliveries of 268 in 2017 
declined by 10% on the previous year, 
with fewer deliveries of both turboprop 
and regional jet aircraft. Regional aircraft 
deliveries are forecast to fall further in 2018 
as airlines continue to opt for smaller large 
jets over existing regional jets.
Business jet deliveries totalled 621 in 2017, 
compared with 647 in 2016. The production 
of large and super mid-size jets has been 
particularly challenged since 2014 with 
deliveries down by 10% per annum during 
this time. In December 2017, Dassault 
announced the cancellation of its Falcon 5X, 
super mid-size business jet, due to ongoing 
problems related to its Silvercrest engine. 
Dassault has announced its intention to 
launch a replacement aircraft with an 
alternative engine which it expects to enter 
service in 2022. 
Looking forward, the market for larger 
business jets is expected to improve in the 
near term, due to continuing improvement 
in global economic conditions, moderately 
increasing oil prices, and a number of new 
platforms entering into service.
Meggitt Performance
Civil OE revenue grew 3% organically. Large 
jet OE, the most significant driver of our 
OE revenue, grew 8% driven principally by 
growth in Airbus A320neo, A350XWB and 
Bombardier CSeries platforms. This was 
partially offset by declining demand for 
Boeing 777X and Airbus A380 platforms 
where deliveries decreased significantly 
during the year. The strong order backlogs 
together with the increased shipset 
content we have secured in areas including 
advanced composites, sensors, engine 
controls, thermal management systems, 
seals and power electronics, gives us 
further confidence in the growth outlook for 
OE revenues. 
Strong growth in large jet OE was offset 
by declining revenue in both regional 
jets (down 6%) and business jets (down 
12%). Our largest exposure to regional 
aircraft and business jets is through our 
wheels and brakes business. Here the 
market model dictates the provision of 
most original equipment free of charge to 
civil aircraft manufacturers for which no 
revenue is recognised. Good success in 
recent competitive tenders means we have

MILITARY
Military business accounted for 34% 
of Group revenues in 2017. We have 
equipment on an installed base of around 
22,000 fixed wing and rotary aircraft and a 
significant number of ground vehicles and 
training applications. Direct sales to US 
customers accounted for 71% of military 
revenue, with 20% to European customers 
and 9% to the rest of the world.
The outlook for defence expenditure in 
the US, our single most important military 
market, continues to look healthy. Military 
budgets increased during 2017 for the first 
time in several years, and there remains 
significant opportunity for retrofit and reset 
activity – such as a contract won in 2017, to 
provide replacement fuel tanks for the  
F/A-18 fleet, much of which has been 
awaiting maintenance to bring it back to 
peak condition following deployment in 
theatre.
Meggitt Performance
Military revenue was up 1% organically, with 
a modest improvement in demand in the 
second half after flat revenue for the first 
six months. Original equipment revenues 
grew by 3%, with good growth at Meggitt 
Equipment Group as a result of strong 
demand for its system of record, small 
arms training systems. OE revenues in our 
other aerospace-focused divisions declined 
during 2017, with good growth on the F-35 
Joint Strike Fighter and P-8 Poseidon offset 
by declining revenue on platforms with 
significant reductions in production rates, 
including the Eurofighter, F-16 Falcon and 
Apache.

AFTERMARKET
The civil aerospace aftermarket is driven 
primarily by aircraft utilisation which, for 
large jets and regional aircraft, is measured 
using available seat kilometres (ASKs). We 
use take-offs and landings as a proxy for 
business jet utilisation. ASKs in the large 
commercial aircraft fleet grew 6.3% in 2017, 
above the 5% long-term average. Traffic 
continues to grow rapidly in the Middle East, 
Europe and Asia Pacific offsetting slower 
growth of 4% in the US. Regional aircraft 
utilisation increased by 1.6% during the year 
but, within this, larger (>70 seat) aircraft 
grew more quickly at 4.3%, demonstrating 
the continued move away from smaller 
aircraft. Business jet utilisation also 
increased, with growth of 1.8% in take offs 
and landings.
We would normally expect our aftermarket 
revenues to follow these leading indicators 
after a lag of a few months. However, 
revenue can be impacted by short-term 
fluctuations arising from destocking and 
restocking cycles, increased pooling of 
spares between airlines and maintenance, 
repair and overhaul (‘MRO’) providers 
and surplus spare parts arising from the 
retirement of old aircraft. 
Meggitt Performance
Civil aftermarket revenue grew organically 
by 6% within which, large jets grew by 8%, 
driven by good growth on Boeing platforms 
including 737, 747 and 787. Aftermarket 
revenues also increased on a number of the 
oldest platforms within our installed base, 
most notably on the DC9, DC10 and MD80. 
This was partly offset by declining revenue 
on modestly younger platforms such as the 
Boeing 727 and Airbus A300.
Our Customer Services and Support 
(CSS) organisation continued to make 
good progress in 2017. During the year, 
civil aftermarket orders grew by 10% and 
we secured a number of agreements with 
airlines, distributors and integrated MRO 
providers which will underpin future revenue 
growth. We had a good year in Asia Pacific 
where revenues at CSS grew by 24% and 
where we secured long term agreements 
with companies including Vietjet, IHI and 
Comac. The acquisition of Elite Aerospace 
has also brought deep expertise in MRO, 
particularly in the field of engine thermal 
management, which will further enhance 
our ability to serve our customers from our 
Miami hub, when fully integrated in the first 
quarter of 2018.
Commercial aircraft utilisation remains 
encouraging, with ASKs continuing to 
track above the long-term average. Further 
reductions in the retirement rate are also 
a positive indicator that the headwind we 
have seen from the premature parting out of 
younger aircraft has continued to subside. 
Over the medium term, we expect to see 
the retirement rate increase as the growing 
production of new single aisle aircraft, 
such as the Boeing 737MAX and Airbus 
A320neo, replace the current generation 
aircraft. However, we remain confident 
about growing revenue above the broader 
civil spares market over the medium term, 
as a result of our increased content on new 
aircraft and the growing capability in CSS 
that will enable us to capture greater growth 
of the available aftermarket.
Flat revenues in regional jet aftermarket 
reflected a strong recovery in the second 
half, after destocking on Bombardier CRJ 
aircraft and lower demand for smaller 
regional aircraft led to a 7% decline in 
the first half. Our position as sole source 
provider of wheels and brakes on the two 
large aircraft platforms that dominate 
traffic growth, the Embraer E-Jet and 
Bombardier CRJ, mean we are well 
positioned to capitalise on this growth. 
However, the introduction of the Embraer 
E2 in 2018 will slowly erode our market 
share as it will be equipped by a competing 
braking system. 
Business jet aftermarket revenue grew 
by 7%, as a result of good growth in 
Gulfstream G-IV and G-V and Hawker 
400/450, partially offset by declining 
revenue on Embraer and Dassault platforms 
including Legacy 450, Falcon 50 and Falcon 
8X. The business jet aftermarket is much 
more concentrated than commercial air 
transport, as the OEMs often meet the 
servicing requirements of their customers. 
As a result, they aggregate demand for 
spares and can often make large purchases 
to build up inventory or defer purchases to 
reduce their inventory of spares, leading to 
lumpy demand from one year to the next. 
Nevertheless our strong gains in market 
share, particularly in wheels and brakes, 
underpin future growth. This should exceed 
the rate of growth in business jet utilisation 
over the medium term. MEGGITT PLC

ENERGY AND OTHER
Energy and other revenues (12% of 
Group total) come from a variety of end 
markets, including power generation 
(3%), oil and gas (2%), medical (1%) and 
automotive (1%). Our energy capabilities 
centre on providing valves and condition-
monitoring equipment for power generation 
installations, including ground-based gas 
and wind turbines, and printed circuit heat 
exchangers used primarily in the offshore oil 
and gas market. 
Market conditions in oil and gas appear to 
have stabilised, with a 13% growth in the 
oil price in 2017. In contrast, demand for 
industrial gas turbines has remained weak.
Meggitt Performance
Energy revenue declined by 8% in 2017 
on an organic basis, including a 21% 
decline at Heatric (our printed circuit heat 
exchanger business) compared to 2016 
when it completed the last of its material 
contracts to supply PCHEs for floating liquid 
natural gas (‘FLNG’) and floating production 
storage and offloading (‘FPSO’) vessels, 
secured before the significant reduction 
in oil price. However, Heatric revenues 
increased sequentially in each quarter and 
grew year on year during the fourth quarter. 
This was the first quarter of year on year 
growth since Q1 2014, and together with 
organic order growth of 80%, underpins 
confidence that Heatric will return to 
revenue growth in 2018.
Organic revenues in power generation 
segments decreased by 5% in the year, 
with Meggitt Sensing Systems experiencing 
weak demand for its sensing systems which 
are typically focused on the large frame 
turbine market. This was only partly offset 
by growth in Meggitt Control Systems which 
is focused on providing valves and actuators 
to small frame and aero-derivative industrial 
gas turbines.
 
The long-term growth expectations for our 
energy businesses, and particularly Heatric, 
remain good. We have differentiated 
technology which plays a critical role in 
the extraction of deep-water offshore gas 
reserves and good opportunity for use 
in adjacent markets. The balance of our 
energy businesses will continue to benefit 
from synergistic relationships across 
business divisions and the long-term 
demand for energy, particularly in emerging 
markets. Divisional review

Operational performance
Meggitt Aircraft Braking Systems (MABS) 
provides wheels, brakes and brake control 
systems for around 35,000 in-service 
aircraft. 
It continues to develop innovative 
technology for new programmes enabling 
the business to retain its leading position in 
its target markets, underscored by the 
strong market share gains in recent years, 
notably on super mid-size and long range 
business jets; and expansion in large jets, 
where in 2017 it has secured a dual source 
contract to provide an alternative braking 
system for the A321neo. 
The division represents 19% of Group 
revenue, generating 90% of its revenue from 
the aftermarket and 10% from OE sales.
MABS’ civil revenue was flat organically, 
with 2% growth in civil aftermarket driven 
by good growth in business jets, particularly 
Gulfstream platforms, and a steady 
recovery during the year in regional jet 
spares, where strong growth on Embraer 
E170 and E190 offset some de-stocking on 
Bombardier CRJ aircraft in the first half and 
lower demand on smaller aircraft. 
Growth in civil aftermarket was offset by a 
21% organic decline in civil OE, reflecting 
lower demand for brake control units 
across a range of regional and business jet 
programmes and for torque tubes on the 
Airbus A380.
MABS’ military revenue declined by 11% 
organically, with significant declines on 
Eurofighter brakes only partly offset by 
growth on F-35. Military orders grew 7% 
organically in 2017, which underpins an 
improving outlook for military revenues 
into 2018. 
Operating margins increased from 36.3% 
to 38.2% in 2017, driven by the positive mix 
effect of a decline in the division’s military 
business during the year.

temperature of oil, fuel and air in aircraft 
engines. The division, which also provides 
fire protection equipment to engines and 
airframes, represents 26% of Group 
revenue, generating 41% of its revenue 
from OE and 59% from the aftermarket. 
Revenue was up by 4% organically. Civil 
aerospace grew by 9%, with good growth in 
OE, driven by particularly strong growth on 
Airbus A320neo, and aftermarket, which 
benefitted from strong demand for spares 
and repairs on Boeing 787, 737 and Airbus 
A340 aircraft. 
Military revenue declined by 14% driven by 
declines on fighter jets, particularly F-15 
and F-16. Energy revenues increased by 2% 
driven by modest growth in demand for 
small frame industrial gas turbine valves. 
Operating margins declined from 24.5% to 
23.5%, reflecting unfavourable revenue 
mix and continued investment to drive 
growth in our CSS organisation.
In January 2018, we sold Aviation Mobility 
to Smart Carte Inc. Aviation Mobility

Operational performance
Meggitt Polymers & Composites (MPC) 
supplies flexible bladder fuel tanks, complex 
composites and seals packages for a broad 
range of civil and military platforms. These 
products are linked by their dependence on 
similar materials technology and 
manufacturing processes. It supplies over 
80% of the US military requirements for fuel 
bladders and ballistically-resistant and 
crashworthy fuel tanks. MPC represents 17% 
of Group revenue and generated 65% of its 
revenue from OE and 35% from the 
aftermarket. 
On an organic basis, MPC revenues were flat 
in 2017 . Civil revenues grew by 9%, with good 
growth on narrowbody large jets (including 
Airbus A320neo and Boeing 737) offset by 
lower demand for widebodies (including 
Airbus A350XWB and A380, Boeing 787 and 
777). 
In contrast, military revenues declined by 
2%, with declining revenue on KC-135, 
Typhoon and Apache, only partly offset by 
good growth on F-35, V-22 and F /A-18.
Growth in orders was strong across all major 
market segments in MPC. In civil aerospace, 
orders grew by 11% organically, reflecting 
strong competitive positions on high volume 
dual source engine programmes. Military 
orders grew by 23%, reflecting particularly 
strong demand for aftermarket including a 
£52m multi-year contract to provide 
replacement fuel tanks for the F /A-18. 
Operating margins decreased from 12.0% to 
7 .1% reflecting an increase in new product 
introduction costs on new programmes, 
where we have significant composites 
content on new engines and where lower 
growth in civil OE than anticipated, 
compromised our ability to fully industrialise 
a broad volume of new parts. 
To address these operational challenges we 
have implemented a series of management 
changes, increased our investment in critical 
capabilities such as programme 
management and taken steps to increase 
capacity in our low cost facilities in Mexico to 
enable the transfer of manufacturing when 
parts are fully industrialised. Increasing build 
rates and the changes we have made in 2017 , 
will enable us to improve margin 
performance in 2018.
The outlook for MPC remains strong given 
the extensive capability we have acquired, 
strong platform positions and potential for 
significant market growth, particularly for 
composite components on new engine 
programmes.

MSS revenue declined by 1% organically, 
with 2% growth in civil aerospace driven by 
growth in aftermarket revenues, as a result 
of increased demand for Boeing 747 and 
787 spares. 
Military revenue declined by 1%, with 
growth in spares for fighter and trainer 
aircraft offset by declining OE revenues on

while benefiting from the wider Meggitt Group’s investment in 
shared services and common processes.
Operational performance
Meggitt Equipment Group (MEG) 
comprises principally our non-engine 
actuation capability and dedicated military 
businesses and Heatric. The division 
represents 13% of Group revenue and 
generates 79% of its revenue from OE and 
21% from the aftermarket. 
MEG revenue grew by 12% organically, 
reflecting good growth in military as a 
result of strong demand for its system of 
record, small arms training systems. In 
energy, revenues decreased by 22%, 
driven by Heatric which in 2016 completed 
the last of its significant contracts to 
support large capital projects in offshore 
gas. This was partly offset by good growth 
in demand in other adjacent markets. 
Heatric, as expected, grew strongly in the 
final quarter and orders grew by 80% 
during the year, supporting the expectation 
of a continued recovery in its core, oil and 
gas market. 
Operating margins increased from 3.5% to 
8.2% driven by improving profitability in 
Training Systems as a result of the good 
growth and a breakeven performance at 
Heatric.
In June 2017, we completed the sale of 
three non-core industrial businesses, 
including a MEG unit, Piher. In the six 
months prior to the sale to Amphenol

Key performance indicators
The Group uses a mix of financial and non-financial key 
performance indicators (KPIs) to measure execution against 
our strategic objectives. To ensure we deliver value to our 
shareholders over the cycle, financial KPIs balance short-term 
measures (underlying operating profit and free cash flow in the 
year) with longer-term measures (organic revenue growth, 
return on trading assets and underlying EPS growth). Non-
financial KPIs focus on investment in R&D to drive future 
revenues, the health and safety of our employees and raising 
standards of operational performance to satisfy our customers. 
The 2016 Annual Report included KPIs for defective parts per 
million (DPPM) and on-time delivery performance. Both of 
these measures are embedded in the Group’s Meggitt 
Production System (MPS) criteria for moving through its 
six-phase programme. 
As disclosed in the 2016 Annual Report, whilst MPS will 
continue to focus on further improvements in DPPM and 
on-time delivery performance, the strategic measures 
considered by the Group to be the next key outputs from MPS 
are gross margin improvement and reductions in inventory 
levels. Such measures were introduced for the 2017 Long Term 
Incentive Plan (LTIP) and accordingly gross margin and 
inventory turns have replaced DPPM and on-time delivery 
performance as KPIs for 2017. 
As discussed on page 39, the Group will adopt IFRS 15, 
‘Revenue from contracts with customers’ and IFRS 16 ‘Leases’ 
with effect from 1 January 2018. The targets disclosed below 
for future periods have been adjusted to reflect the estimated 
impact of these new standards. 
Organic revenue growth  
Definition and basis of calculation 
Revenue growth calculated by measuring 
current and prior year revenue at constant 
currency, excluding revenue from any 
businesses acquired or disposed of in 
those periods. To measure revenue at 
constant currency, current year revenue is 
restated using translation and transaction 
exchange rates prevailing in the prior year. 
See page 35 for a reconciliation of organic 
revenue to revenue. 
Target 
Growth of 2% to 4% in 2018.
Result
Achieved 1.6% against a target of 2% to 
4%. See page 34 for details.

Return on trading assets (ROTA) 
Underlying EPS growth 
  
Definition and basis of calculation
Underlying operating profit after tax 
expressed as a percentage of average 
trading assets. Underlying operating profit 
is defined and reconciled to statutory 
measures in note 10 to the Group 
consolidated financial statements on page 
127. Underlying operating profit after tax 
applies the Group’s underlying tax rate for 
the year to underlying operating profit. (For 
2017, the underlying tax rate was 23.7%. 
For 2016, it was 23.5%).
Trading assets are defined as net assets 
adjusted to exclude goodwill, other 
intangible assets arising on the acquisition 
of businesses, investments, net debt, 
retirement benefit obligations, derivative 
financial instruments and deferred tax. 
Average trading assets are calculated as 
the average of trading assets at the start 
and end of the year. 
ROTA measures performance by linking 
operating performance to the amount of 
operating capital employed.
Definition and basis of calculation 
The percentage change in underlying 
earnings per share (EPS) from the previous 
year. Underlying EPS is defined and 
reconciled to statutory measures in note 15 
to the Group consolidated financial 
statements on page 130. 
Target 
We do not publish profit targets. However, 
the proposed 2018 LTIP includes EPS 
targets equivalent to growth ranging from 
3.0% to 9.0% per annum over the next 
three years after the impact of adopting 
IFRS 15 and IFRS 16.
Target
In 2018, underlying operating profit after 
tax will be replaced by underlying 
operating profit, as taxation is not 
controllable by management. Following 
this change in definition, along with the 
impacts of adopting IFRS 15 and IFRS 16, 
the target for 2018 is to achieve a ROTA of 
26.8%. The target recognises the need to 
continue to invest in trading assets during 
this period in the aerospace cycle.
Result
2017: 19.6%. See page 36 for details of 
the current high levels of investment to 
support future growth.
Directors’ incentive plans
ROTA is a performance measure for both 
the 2017 and 2018 LTIP for employees 
excluding executive directors. For 
executive directors, the 2018 LTIP 
includes a return on capital employed 
(ROCE) measure rather than ROTA. For 
the purpose of these plans, underlying 
operating profit and trading assets are 
measured at constant currency. See 
pages 86 and 89 to 90 for details.
Result
2017: 1.4%. CAGR achieved over last 
three years: +2.9%. See page 36

Total recordable incident rate (TRIR) 
Definition and basis of calculation 
The total recordable incident rate 
calculated per 100 employees. It is 
calculated as the number of recordable 
incidents multiplied by 200,000 and then 
divided by the total number of hours 
worked during the year. 
Target
To achieve a TRIR of 0.6 by 2019 which is 
considered a best in class health and safety 
performance.
Result
2017: 1.2. The Group started collecting 
TRIR data for this new KPI at a Group level 
in 2017. TRIR data for 2016 is only 
available for the Group’s US sites, for 
which data is provided for comparison 
purposes. See page 48 for details.
Directors’ incentive plans
Health and safety performance is not a 
specific measure used in directors’ 
incentive plans. However, it is integrated 
into MPS and both the 2017 and 2018

Gross margin  
Inventory turns 
Definition and basis of calculation
Underlying gross profit expressed as a 
percentage of revenue. Underlying gross 
profit adjusts gross profit for the impact of 
items charged to cost of sales but which 
are excluded from the Group’s underlying 
profit measures as disclosed in note 10 to 
the Group consolidated financial 
statements on page 127.
Gross margin improvement is considered 
by the Group to be one of the next key 
outputs from MPS.
Target
The proposed 2018 LTIP includes a gross 
margin target of 38.8% for 2018.
Definition and basis of calculation
Underlying cost of sales divided by average 
inventory measured at constant currency 
and excluding businesses acquired or 
disposed of in the year. 
Underlying cost of sales adjusts cost of 
sales for the impact of items which are 
excluded from the Group’s underlying 
profit measures as disclosed in note 10 to 
the Group consolidated financial 
statements on page 127.
Average inventory is calculated as the 13 
month average of inventory, gross of 
provision, at the end of the previous 
financial year and at the end of each month 
of the current year. To measure inventory 
at constant currency, average inventory of 
foreign subsidiaries is translated at average 
exchange rates for the year.
An increase in inventory turns is 
considered by the Group to be one of the 
next key outputs from MPS.
Result
2017: 39.6%. 
Directors’ incentive plans
Gross margin is a performance measure 
for both the 2017 and 2018 LTIP. For the 
purpose of these plans, revenue and cost

Revenue
Reported revenue grew by 2% to 
£2,027.3m (2016: £1,992.4m), reflecting 
favourable currency movements in the 
Group’s major currencies, predominantly 
the weakness of sterling compared to the 
US dollar, which partly reversed in the 
second half. This was offset by lower 
revenue as a result of non-core disposals 
completed in 2016 and 2017, partly offset 
by the acquisition of Elite Aerospace in 
March 2017.
Organic revenue grew by 2%, reflecting 4% 
growth in our civil aerospace business and 
modest growth in military offset by an 
expected decline in energy revenue.
Civil OE revenue grew by 3% organically. 
Large jet revenue grew strongly as a result 
of growing deliveries on the major new civil 
aircraft platforms where we have secured 
healthy increases in shipset content, 
including the Airbus A320neo and 
A350XWB, together with the Bombardier 
CSeries. 
Growth in large jet revenue was partly 
offset by declining revenue in regional and 
business jets where aircraft deliveries were 
down 10% and 4% respectively compared 
to the prior year.
In civil aftermarket, organic revenue 
increased by 6%, reflecting good demand 
for spare parts on large jets and business 
jets. In large jets, revenue increased by 8% 
as a result of good growth on Boeing 737, 
747 and 787. In business jets, growth of 7%, 
reflects good demand on platforms where 
we provide wheels and brakes such as the 
Gulfstream G-IV and G-V and Hawker 
400/450. Revenue in regional jets was flat, 
with a good recovery in the second half 
On an organic basis revenue 
grew 2% with good growth in 
civil aerospace offset by 
continued challenges in our 
energy business. Underlying 
operating margin grew by 10 
basis points, with the benefit 
from our strategic initiatives 
now sufficient to offset 
headwinds from mix, 
depreciation and 
amortisation, and new 
product introduction costs. 
Reductions in inventory and 
capitalised development costs 
contributed to a strong cash 
performance with free cash 
flow up 42%.

after declining revenue during the first six 
months when we saw destocking of brakes 
across the range of Bombardier CRJ 
platforms.
In military, organic revenue grew by 1% as a 
result of a modest improvement in the 
second half after flat revenue for the first 
six months. Increased demand for new 
aircraft including the F-35 and P-8 
contributed to OE revenue growth of 3%, 
despite declining revenue on Eurofighter, 
F-16 and Apache. Aftermarket revenue 
(which accounts for 42% of total military 
revenue) declined by 3%, reflecting lower 
demand on platforms including Typhoon, 
F-15, F-16 and Gripen, offset by growth on 
F-35 and helicopter programmes including 
Apache and V-22. 
Energy revenue declined organically by 
8%, including a 21% decline at Heatric 
which completed the last of its significant 
contracts to support large capital projects 
in offshore gas during 2016. Heatric, as 
expected, grew strongly in the fourth 
quarter of 2017. Organic revenues in power 
generation segments also declined during 
the year, down 5%, driven by lower demand 
for sensors which are typically sold onto 
larger industrial gas turbines, partly offset 
by modest growth in demand for valves 
and actuators for small frame and 
aero-derivative gas turbines.
Profit
The Board’s preferred non-statutory 
measure of the Group’s trading 
performance is underlying profit. 
Underlying operating profit was up 2% to 
£388.4m (2016: £379.7m), representing a 
margin of 19.2% (2016: 19.1%). The margin 
improvement reflects the growing financial 
contribution from the Group’s key strategic 
priorities, including productivity 
improvements driven by the Meggitt 
Production System and purchasing savings 
driven by a centralised approach to 
category management. This was partly 
offset by continued dilution from mix and 
depreciation and amortisation, together 
with a significant decline in margin at 
Meggitt Polymers & Composites, where 
programme delays contributed to higher 
than expected new product introduction 
costs. 
Underlying net finance costs increased to 
£30.5m (2016: £27.6m) reflecting 
developing inter alia, a complex braking 
system for the Falcon 5X and a range of 
controls for its Silvercrest engine. Given the 
successor programme is expected to feature 
the same cross section as the Falcon 5X and 
will reuse a maximum of development work 
undertaken to date, we are hopeful that 
Meggitt will be selected to provide the 
braking system for the replacement aircraft. 
However, as described in note 4 to the Group 
consolidated financial statements, a 
significant level of uncertainty remains and it 
is not possible to reliably estimate the extent 
to which any of the costs incurred to date will 
be recoverable and accordingly a full 
impairment loss has been recognised against 
all balances on the programme. 
Statutory profit after tax increased by 
104% to £350.0m (2016: £171.2m)
reflecting a £122.6m one-off, non-cash gain 
on the remeasurement of US deferred tax 
net liabilities as a result of the decrease in 
US federal corporate tax from 35% to 21% 
following US tax legislation commonly 
referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, 
enacted in December 2017.

Chief Financial Officer’s review continued
Taxation
Meggitt’s underlying tax rate stayed 
relatively flat at 23.7% (2016: 23.5%). Our 
guidance for 2018 is for a significant 
reduction in the Group tax rate to around 
21% driven mainly by the US tax reforms 
enacted at the end of 2017. This reduced 
rate reflects the impact of the reduction in 
the US federal rate from 35% to 21%, 
partially offset by the elimination of the 
domestic production deduction and the 
tightening of the interest deduction 
limitation. Looking further out, our rate will 
likely drift higher within the 20-22% range, 
which we indicated in January 2018, as the 
impact of the Base Erosion and Profit 
Shifting project (the “BEPS project”) 
continues to increase our tax expense 
outside the US.
Although the international tax position is 
now becoming clearer following enactment 
of the recommendations from BEPS in the 
UK together with the US tax reforms, there 
are still uncertainties ahead – including the 
outcome of the EU’s investigation of the UK 
CFC regime, the impact of Brexit and the 
expected reforms in Swiss tax. On the first 
of these the Group, in common with many 
other international companies, has taken 
advantage of the benefits available under 
the Group Financing Exemption provisions 
in the UK controlled foreign company rules. 
We are therefore monitoring developments 
in this area but do not currently consider 
any provision is required. For the latter two, 
the final outcome is too uncertain to make 
any assessment of their possible impact on 
the Group.
Cash tax paid as a percentage of underlying 
profit before tax was 7% (2016: 8%). The 
rate of cash tax is lower than our underlying 
tax rate due to tax deductible items which 
do not affect underlying profit, principally 
the amortisation of intangible assets 
arising on the acquisition of businesses and 
tax relief on retirement benefit deficit 
reduction payments. The reduction in US 
federal tax rate will not have any 
corresponding significant reduction in cash 
tax payable as its impact on these tax 
deductible items will offset much of the 
benefit from the lower effective rate. 
Our statutory tax rate, which includes 
items excluded from underlying profit 
before tax, was a credit of 33% (2016: 
charge of 12%). The main impact of the US 
tax reforms on the 2017 results was that 
deferred tax balances were required to be 
remeasured at the lower rates expected to 
prevail when the items giving rise to the 
balances reverse. The Group has 
significant US deferred tax net liabilities 
arising from past acquisitions, 
development costs and programme 
participation costs and the remeasurement 
resulted in a tax credit of £122.6m being 
recorded in the income statement. Without 
this impact, the statutory tax rate would 
have been a charge of 13%. Cash tax paid 
as a percentage of statutory profit before 
tax was 9% (2016: 14%). 
The Group is committed to complying fully 
with the laws in the countries in which it 
operates. We seek to achieve a competitive 
tax rate by maintaining appropriate levels 
of debt in high tax jurisdictions, claiming 
available tax credits and incentives and 
utilising common financing structures 
where appropriate. We are rated as low risk 
by HM Revenue & Customs and our tax 
policy seeks to retain this low risk rating. A 
copy of the Group’s tax strategy is available 
on our website.
Earnings per share (EPS)
Underlying EPS increased by 1% to 35.3p 
(2016: 34.8p) broadly in line with the 
growth in underlying profit before tax. 
Statutory EPS increased by 105% to 45.2p 
(2016: 22.1p). The benefit from the 
reduction in US tax rate on deferred tax net 
liabilities described above was a driver of 
15.8p of this statutory EPS increase. The 
other principal drivers of the increase in 
statutory EPS were the reversal of losses 
taken in 2016 on the marking to market of 
foreign currency forward contracts, as 
these contracts either matured in the 
current year or their fair value increased 
following the recent strengthening of 
sterling which accounted for a 12.9p 
increase, partly offset by a 4.9p adverse 
movement arising from the impairment 
loss recognised following cancellation of 
the Dassault Falcon 5X programme. 
Dividends
The Group’s policy is to grow dividends 
broadly in line with underlying EPS over the 
cycle. The Board has recommended a final 
dividend of 10.80p (2016: 10.30p) which 
would result in a 5% increase in the 
full-year dividend to 15.85p (2016: 15.10p). 
The Company has a balance on its profit 
and loss reserve at 31 December 2017 of 
£1,146.4m (2016: £996.7m), of which 
approximately £1,000.0m (2016: 
£850.0m) relates to reserves which can be 
distributed as a dividend or used for share 
buybacks, and accordingly we have a 
comfortable level of headroom. 
The dividend reinvestment plan, 
introduced in 2015, will be continued in 
2018. It provides an efficient reinvestment 
option for shareholders, without the need 
for new shares to be issued by the 
Company.
Investing for the future
Targeted investment in technology 
development remains critical to our 
long-term organic growth. Total R&D 
expenditure reduced in 2017 to £153.7m 
and was 7.6% of revenue (2016: £157.8m, 
7.9%), of which 23% (2016: 20%) was 
funded by customers. The charge to net 
operating costs, including amortisation 
and impairment, increased by 12% (16% 
organically) to £79.3m (2016: £71.0m).
Reduced spend on capitalised R&D (down 
17% organically) reflects the continued 
progress made on development 
programmes for new aircraft platforms 
including the 737MAX which entered 
service in 2017. As more programmes, 
particularly business jets, enter into 
service over the next few years, we expect 
R&D to reduce further as a percentage of 
revenue. The new product introduction 
expenditure associated with these 
platforms will soon pass their peak. This 
reflects the increased content we have 
secured on a wide range of new platforms, 
which is good for future revenues, but the 
cost of introducing record numbers of new 
parts impacts profitability in the short 
term. We continue to expect growth in 
expensed R&D relating to our successful 
applied research and technology (AR&T) 
programmes, which will develop the next 
generation products and manufacturing 
technologies required to enable future 
aircraft programmes. Customer funded 
R&D will also continue to increase given our 
success in securing customer funded 
development programmes and grants to 
support AR&T activity, such as the £3.7m 
award to support research into advanced 
thermal systems for ultra-high bypass ratio 
engines.

Our investment in programme 
participation costs for the supply of 
equipment free of charge to new aircraft, 
mostly in MABS, increased by 4% 
organically. This reflects growth in new 
platforms where we have strong positions, 
particularly the Bombardier CSeries. 
Growth is expected to increase significantly 
in 2018, and beyond, as deliveries of 
aircraft equipped with our wheels and 
brakes increase rapidly, which in turn will 
drive aftermarket revenue stretching out 
for decades. 
Capital expenditure on property, plant and 
equipment and intangible assets was 
£78.4m (2016: £65.5m). This includes the 
investment required to support factory 
consolidations and the expansion of sites in 
Vietnam, Mexico, San Diego and North 
Hollywood. It also includes investment in 
software which increased in 2017 reflecting 
the need to comply with US DoD 
requirements for suppliers to meet higher 
standards for cyber security. Capital 
expenditure will increase further in 2018, 
as we accelerate plans to consolidate the 
Group’s manufacturing footprint, including 
initial investments at the Ansty Park site 
and completion of current construction 
and fit out projects to increase capacity in 
our existing estate.
Cash flow
2017 was a strong year for cash driven by a 
lower working capital outflow where we 
invested £38.4m less than in 2016 as a 
result of an excellent start to our inventory 
reduction initiative. We have set a target to 
improve inventory turns to 4x by 2021 and 
delivered the first down payment on this 
with a 0.13x improvement releasing £16.3m 
of cash. This was offset by an increase in 
receivables driven by more revenue 
secured later in the fourth quarter than the 
prior year and delays to receiving 
scheduled cash payments from a number 
of our larger customers. After taking 
account of the impact of reduced 
investment in development costs and 
increase in capital expenditure described 
above, free cash flow increased by 42% to 
£186.0m (2016: £131.1m).
Net cash inflow of £108.8m (2016: inflow of 
£77.9m) after dividend payments, includes 
the £60.4m net proceeds from the sales of 
Meggitt Maryland, Piezo Technologies and 
Piher, partly offset by the acquisition of 
Elite Aerospace.
Debt structure and financing
The Group’s borrowings comprise a 
combination of US private placement debt 
and syndicated and bilateral bank credit 
facilities. During the year, USD200m of 
private placement notes matured and were 
repaid out of existing facilities. The Group 
also voluntarily cancelled USD150m of its 
USD900m committed revolving credit facility 
reflecting our lower debt requirements as a 
result of the recent disposals and good cash 
generation. At the same time, and for the 
same reasons, the Group cancelled the £75m 
three-year commitment from Sumitomo 
Mitsui Banking Corporation provided at the 
end of 2016. There were no other changes in 
facilities available to the Group in the year. 
At 31 December 2017, the Group had 
undrawn committed credit facilities of 
£331m after taking account of surplus cash 
(2016: £520m). The Group has no 
committed facilities which expire before 
2020.
Capital structure
The Group has a strong track record of 
cash generation and net debt reduction, 
even in periods of the aerospace cycle, as 
we have been recently experiencing, that 
drive elevated organic investment. In 
addition to supporting our regular dividend, 
we seek to deploy this cash by investing 
organically to accelerate the Group’s 
growth and investing in the acquisition of 
complementary businesses which expand 
our offering to customers and deliver 
enhanced returns to shareholders.
The Board believes that in maintaining an 
efficient balance sheet with appropriate 
covenant headroom and investment 
capacity, a net debt:EBITDA ratio, as 
measured on a covenant basis, of between 
1.5x and 2.5x is appropriate, whilst 
retaining the flexibility to move outside the 
range if appropriate. Net debt:EBITDA was 
1.9x at 31 December (2016: 2.1x).

Debt financing risks
The Group seeks to minimise debt 
financing risk as follows: 
a. Concentration of risk 
We raise funds through private placement 
issuances and committed bank facilities to 
reduce reliance on any one market. Bank 
financing is sourced from 13 international 
institutions spread across North America, 
Europe and Asia. No single bank accounts 
for more than 4% of the Group’s total credit 
facilities and the credit rating of lenders is 
monitored by our treasury department. 
The Group’s largest lenders are Bank of 
America, HSBC, Bank of China, Barclays, 
BNP Paribas, Crédit Industriel et 
Commercial, JP Morgan, Bank of Tokyo-
Mitsubishi and Sumitomo Mitsui Banking 
Corporation. We seek to maintain at least 
£100m of undrawn committed facilities, 
net of cash, as a buffer. 
b. Set-off arrangements 
The Group utilises set-off and netting 
arrangements to reduce the potential 
effect of counterparty defaults. All treasury 
transactions are settled on a net basis 
where possible and surplus cash is 
generally deposited with our lenders up to 
the level of their current exposure to us. MEGGITT PLC

Chief Financial Officer’s review continued
c. Refinancing risk 
We seek to ensure the maturity of our 
facilities is staggered and any refinancing is 
concluded in good time, typically more 
than 12 months before expiry. 
d. Currency risk 
To ensure we mitigate headroom erosion 
due to currency movements, our credit 
facilities are denominated in US Dollars, 
the currency in which most of our 
borrowings are held.

Net debt 964.8 1,179.1
e. Covenant risk 
Our committed credit facilities contain two 
financial ratio covenants – net debt:EBITDA 
and interest cover. The covenant 
calculations are drafted to protect us from 
potential volatility caused by accounting 
standard changes, sudden movements in 
exchange rates and exceptional items. This 
is achieved by measuring EBITDA on a 
frozen GAAP basis, retranslating net debt 
and EBITDA at similar average exchange 
rates for the year and excluding exceptional 
items from the definition of EBITDA. We 
continue to have considerable headroom 
on both key financial covenant measures.

Interest cover ≥3.0x 13.6x 14.5x
1 A ratio of 4.0x applies in the two six month 
reporting periods following a significant

Interest risk
The Group seeks to reduce volatility 
caused by interest rate fluctuations on net 
debt. Our US private placements are 
subject to fixed interest rates, whereas 
borrowings under our syndicated and 
bilateral bank credit facilities are at floating 
rates. To manage interest rate volatility, we 
use interest rate derivatives to either 
convert floating rate interest into fixed rate 
or vice versa. Our policy is to generally 
maintain at least 25% of net debt at fixed 
rates with a weighted average maturity of 
two years or more. At 31 December 2017, 
the percentage of net debt at fixed rates 
was 66% (2016: 66%) and the weighted 
average period to maturity for the first 25% 
was 8.3 years (2016: 5.7 years). A higher 
proportion of debt is held at fixed interest 
rates, than the minimum required under 
our policy, in anticipation of further 
increases in market interest rates.
Foreign exchange risk
The Group is exposed to both translation and 
transaction risk due to changes in foreign 
exchange rates. These risks principally relate 
to the US Dollar/Sterling rate, although 
exposure also exists in relation to other 
currency pairs, principally translation risk for 
the Sterling/Euro and Sterling/Swiss Franc 
and transaction risk for the US Dollar/Euro 
and US Dollar/Swiss Franc. 
Exchange rates (Table 10)

Average translation rates against Sterling:

US Dollar 1.35 1.24
Euro 1.13 1.17
Swiss Franc 1.32 1.26
The results of foreign subsidiaries are 
translated into Sterling at weighted average 
exchange rates. The weakening of Sterling 
against all of the Group’s major currencies 
has had a modest favourable impact on our 
reported results for the year. Compared to 
2016, the Group’s revenue increased by 
£42.6m and underlying profit before tax for 
the year by £10.1m from currency 
translation movements. These benefits 
include favourable impacts of £30.3m and 
£7.4m respectively relating to US Dollar 
denominated revenues and profits. 
Benefits were weighted towards the first 
half of 2017, with the strengthening of 
Sterling in the second half resulting in an 
adverse impact on revenue and underlying 
profit before tax of £37.0m and £3.8m 
respectively in that period.

Post-retirement benefit schemes
The Group’s principal defined benefit 
pension schemes are in the UK and US and 
are closed to new members. Total pension 
scheme deficits decreased to £258.3m 
(2016: £360.2m). The principal drivers of 
the reduction in net deficit included: 
• A reduction of £56.8m (2016: £72.4m) 
due to remeasurement gains on scheme 
assets, driven by a strong performance 
across most asset classes, but 
particularly from equities; and 
 
• Net deficit reduction payments of 
£31.5m (2016: £33.3m). Deficit 
payments in 2016 included an additional 
one-off payment of £10.2m agreed with 
the trustees of the UK scheme following 
the sale of the Group’s UK Target 
Systems business and the withdrawal of 
that company from the scheme. STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE OTHER INFORMATION
MEGGITT PLC 39 Annual Report and Accounts 2017
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS GOVERNANCE StrategIc r ep Ort
As previously highlighted, the most 
significant impact for the Group is in the 
accounting for programme participation 
costs, where the manufactured cost of free 
of charge (‘FOC’) or heavily discounted 
hardware will no longer be capitalised and 
then amortised, but instead expensed as 
incurred. Most typically found in MABS, 
these account for the majority of our 
programme participation costs. FOC costs 
are expected to increase significantly in the 
next few years as the large number of new 
aircraft with such parts enter service. 
This will be dilutive to margin, but the 
typical 18 to 24 month replacement cycle 
for brakes on a high utilisation commercial 
aircraft, results in steady aftermarket 
revenue over the life of the aircraft.
Other areas of revenue recognition which 
will be affected by the new standard 
include power by the hour and cost per 
brake landing contracts, those for which 
contract accounting is currently applied 
and funded R&D contracts. Fortunately, 
more than 90% of our revenue is derived 
from the sale of goods where we recognise 
revenue currently when we ship product 
and this will not change significantly under 
the new standard. 
Overall we have estimated that the impact 
of adopting IFRS 15 would have been to 
reduce revenues reported for 2017 by 
£30.5m and underlying operating profit by 
£32.7m. Of the estimated reduction in 
profit, £22.9m arises from the expensing of 
FOC. The estimated impact would result in 
a restated 2017 earnings per share of 
32.0p. The estimated impact on net assets 
In the UK, the Group is making deficit 
payments in accordance with a recovery 
plan agreed with the trustees following the 
2015 triennial funding valuation. This 
recovery plan provides for the deficit at 
that date on a funding basis of £249.4m to 
be addressed by payments which gradually 
increase over the period to 2024. At the 
date of the valuation, the buy-out deficit, 
which assumes the Group were to transfer 
responsibility of the scheme to an 
insurance company, was measured at 
£544.1m. The Group has no current plans 
to make such a transfer. Since the date of 
the 2015 actuarial valuation, it is estimated 
the funding deficit has increased further, 
and an additional £70.0m is not covered by 
the existing agreed recovery plan. This 
increase is driven principally by a fall in gilt 
yields since the valuation date. To the 
extent an additional funding shortfall 
remains at April 2018, the date of the next 
triennial funding valuation, it will be 
addressed through agreement with the 
trustees. It is expected that any revised 
recovery plan arising from this valuation 
will be finalised in the first half of 2019.
In the US, the level of deficit payments is 
principally driven by regulations. Amounts 
required to be paid in the year increased to 
£5.1m, as expected and absent any further 
changes in legislation, deficit payments are 
expected to increase further to £8.2m in 
2018 and will increase gradually over the 
following four years to £14.0m by 2022, 
before stabilising around this level.
During 2017, a lump sum offer was made to 
certain former employees of the US funded 
schemes and £11.4m was paid by the 
schemes to settle those liabilities. 
Additionally, the Swiss scheme agreed 
changes to the rates at which benefits are 
payable. These two changes, which reduce 
the Group’s exposure to longevity risk in 
those schemes, resulted in a past service 
credit of £7.1m. 
Meggitt has two other principal post-
retirement benefit schemes providing 
medical and life assurance benefits to 
certain US employees. The Group’s 
exposure to increases in future medical 
costs provided under these plans is 
capped. Both schemes are unfunded and 
have a combined deficit of £49.8m (2016: 
£54.5m), with the reduction principally 
driven by exchange differences. Deficit 
payments during the year were £2.0m 
(2016: £1.7m).
Recent accounting developments
IFRS 15, the new revenue accounting 
standard, comes into effect from 2018. It is 
a complicated standard, requiring the 
terms of every significant customer 
contract to be considered against new 
revenue recognition rules.

is a reduction of £234.2m at 31 December 
2017, driven principally by the expensing of 
all FOC previously capitalised. We have 
completed a review of the majority of our 
significant contracts to assess the detailed 
impact of IFRS 15. A further review of 
contracts, principally those which 
generated revenue under current GAAP in 
the latter part of 2017, will be completed in 
2018. This will lead to revisions of the 
estimates above as amounts are finalised. 
IFRS 16, the new leasing standard, comes 
into effect from 2019 and will require 
certain operating leases to be recognised 
on the balance sheet. Rather than make 
accounting changes in successive years we 
will early adopt IFRS 16 in 2018, to align 
with the timetable for implementation of 
IFRS 15. We estimate IFRS 16 will result in 
£90.0m of additional assets being 
recognised together with a corresponding 
lease liability. The impact on the income 
statement will not be significant. 
Most critically, neither standard will have 
an impact on cash flow or the economic 
return from a programme and therefore on 
the intrinsic value of Meggitt. 
Further details on the potential impact of 
both IFRS 15 and IFRS 16 are provided in 
note 2 to the Group consolidated financial 
statements on pages 118 to 119.

Risk management
Meggitt seeks to operate within a low risk appetite range 
overall. Effective risk management is required to deliver to 
this appetite while supporting the achievement of the Group’s 
strategy and business objectives. Our risk management 
framework is based on ISO 31000 and includes a formal 
process for identifying, assessing and responding to risk.
During 2017, we continued to refine our approach. The Board 
approved an updated Group risk appetite statement with 
associated risk tolerances to ensure that identified risks are 
managed within acceptable limits. Comfort over the 
management of these risks is demonstrated on the updated 
Group risk assurance map which summarises the assurance 
activities taking place throughout the Group in relation to the 
principal risks. Where appropriate, insurance is used to manage 
risks and our risk management procedures are shared with our 
insurers when assessing any potential exposures. Our insurers 
have provided funding via a bursary to enable more detailed 
reviews of certain risks to increase understanding of the key 
drivers and enable more efficient action to address these, either 
through mitigation or insurance. These reviews have been well 
received by the risk owners for improving their ability to monitor 
and assess their risks and by the insurers for providing a more 
detailed analysis of the causes and their respective impacts.
The Board
The Board takes overall responsibility, determining the nature and extent of the principal 
risks it is willing to take in achieving Meggitt’s strategic objectives; and overseeing the 
Group’s risk governance structure and internal control framework. During 2017, the 
Board has carried out a robust assessment of the principal risks facing the Group, 
including those that would threaten its business model, future performance, solvency or 
liquidity. This report describes those risks and how they are being managed or mitigated.
The Audit Committee
The Board has delegated responsibility for reviewing and ensuring the effectiveness of 
the risk management process to the Audit Committee.
Executive Committee
Divisional and functional leadership are responsible for the management of risk and for 
compiling and maintaining their own risk registers, which outline risks at business unit 
and programme levels. The Executive Committee as a whole regularly reviews the 
Group’s principal risks, while individual members own specific risks.
Governance
The responsibility for risk management operates at all levels throughout Meggitt:
After they have been identified, risks are 
reviewed at a facility level and aggregated 
for review at divisional and functional levels 
on a consistent basis before being 
submitted for the Group’s regular review 
process.
The resultant Group Risk Register is 
subject to a detailed review and discussion 
by the Executive Committee which includes 
discussion of risks which may not have 
been identified through the normal 
channels. The Board assesses the outputs 
from this process and takes comfort from 
the ‘3 lines of defence’ risk assurance 
model. The first line represents operational 
management who own and manage risk on 
Our process
Our risk management processes require 
identified risks throughout the Group to be 
owned by a named individual. They must 
review them regularly and consider related 
new risks. Risk identification is embedded 
within other processes, including strategy, 
project and programme management, bid 
approvals and other operational activities. 
Risk tolerance levels are flowed down to the 
divisions and functions. The likely 
timeframe within which the impact of risks 
might be felt (‘risk velocity’) and how we 
prioritise risks is considered as part of our 
risk management strategy and feeds into 
our assessment of long term viability.
a day-to-day basis, utilising effective 
internal controls. Group functions and 
divisions monitor and oversee these 
activities, representing governance and 
compliance at the second line. The third 
line is the independent assurance over 
these activities provided by internal and 
external audits.
Meggitt’s corporate strategy is designed to 
optimise our business model and take risk, 
with the required controls, on an informed 
basis. See pages 10 to 21 for a full description 
of our business model and strategy. To enable 
value to be created for our shareholders, we 
set varying risk tolerances and associated 
criteria. We accept and manage risk as 
described on the following page. STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE OTHER INFORMATION

Principal risks and uncertainties 
In accordance with the Group’s risk management procedures, 
we have evaluated our risk disclosures and focused this 
report on the principal risks. Financial risks associated with a 
multinational business, including foreign exchange, are 
disclosed in the Chief Financial Officer’s review on pages 34 
to 39.
The risks outlined below, which are not presented in order of 
priority, are those the Group believes are the principal ones it 
currently faces. However, additional risks, of which the Group 
is unaware, or risks the Group currently considers to be less 
significant, could have a material adverse impact.

Oversight of risk and internal 
control
The Board is responsible for risk 
management and internal control and for 
maintaining and reviewing its financial and 
operational effectiveness. The Board has 
taken into account the guidance provided by 
the FRC on Risk Management and Internal 
Control in carrying out its duties. The system 
of internal control is designed to manage, but 
not to eliminate, the risk of failure to achieve 
business objectives and to provide 
reasonable, but not absolute, assurance 
against material misstatement or loss. 
The Group’s functions are responsible for 
determining Group policies and processes. 
The businesses are responsible for 
implementing them, with internal and/or 
external audits to confirm business unit 
compliance. The key features of the risk 
management and internal control system 
are described below, including those 
relating to the financial reporting process, 
as required under the Disclosure Guidance 
and Transparency Rules (DTR):
• Group policies – key policies are 
approved by the Board and other 
policies are approved by Group 
functions; 
• Process controls – for example financial 
controls including the Group Finance 
Policies and Procedures Manual, the bid 
approval process, programme lifecycle 
management reviews, IT security 
framework and risk management. The 
risk management process, which 
enables the Group to identify, evaluate 
and manage the Group’s principal risks 
was in place throughout 2017 and up to 
the date of approval of the Annual 
Report and has been regularly reviewed

MEGGITT PLC 45 Annual Report and Accounts 2017
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS GOVERNANCE StrategIc r ep Ort
The following features allow the Group to 
monitor the effective implementation of 
policies and process controls by business 
units:
• A business performance review process 
(including financial, operational and 
compliance performance); 
• Semi-annual business unit and 
divisional sign-off of compliance with 
Group policies and processes; 
• Compliance programmes and external 
audits (including trade compliance, 
ethics, anti-corruption, health, safety 
and environmental); 
• An effective internal audit function 
which, primarily, performs business unit 
reviews by rotation (including finance, 
programme management, IT, HR and 
ethics); and 
• A whistleblowing line to enable 
employees to raise concerns.
To review the effectiveness of the system 
of internal controls, the Board and Audit 
Committee applied the following processes 
and activities in 2017 and up to the date of 
approval of the Annual Report:
• Reviews of the risk management 
process, risk register and risk appetite; 
• Written and verbal reports to the Audit 
Committee from internal and external 
audit on progress with internal control 
activities, including:
 – Reviews of business processes and 
activities, including action plans to 
address any identified control 
weaknesses and recommendations 
for improvements to controls or 
processes; 
 – The results of internal audits; 
 – Internal control recommendations 
made by the external auditors; and 
 – Follow-up actions from previous 
internal control recommendations.
• An independent review of internal audit 
effectiveness is to be performed by a 
third party;
• Regular compliance reports from the 
Executive Director, Commercial and 
Corporate Affairs;
• Regular reports on the state of the 
business from the Chief Executive and 
Chief Financial Officer; 
• A presentation on IT security activities 
and plans; 
• Strategy reviews, review of the ten year 
financial plan and review and approval of 
the 2018 budget; 
• Written reports to the Ethics and Trade 
Compliance Committee on the 
effectiveness and outcomes of 
whistleblowing procedures; and 
• Reports on insurance coverage and 
uninsured risks.
The risk management and internal control 
systems have been in place for the year 
under review and up to the date of approval 
of the Annual Report, and are regularly 
reviewed by the Board. The Board monitors 
executive management’s action plans to 
implement improvements in internal 
controls that have been identified following 
the above mentioned reviews and reports. 
The Board confirms that it has not 
identified any significant failings or 
weaknesses in the Group’s systems of risk 
management or internal control as a result 
of information provided to the Board and 
resulting discussions.
Viability statement
In accordance with provision C.2.2 of the 
2016 Code, the directors have assessed the 
prospects of the Group over a period of five 
years from the balance sheet date (the 
Board having determined five years as the 
appropriate period for the reasons stated
below), taking account of its current 
position and the potential impact of the 
principal risks set out above.
The Board selected the period of five years 
for the following reasons:
• The Group’s multi-year strategic plan 
covers an initial five-year period. 
Modelling by the Group for periods of 
over five years involves extrapolating 
the trend in years three to five and thus 
inevitably is more uncertain;
• The investment cycle for a typical 
engineering development programme is 
up to five years;
• Although individual platforms operate 
for periods of 30 years or more, our 
five-year viability period aligns with the 
typical aerospace cycle, and the longer 
term nature of our platform cycles, and 
the support that brings to the 
expectation of viability beyond the 
formal five-year assessment period, is 
explained elsewhere in the Annual 
Report; and
• The five-year viability period is 
consistent with the period over which 
we consider risks covered by the Group 
Risk Register.
In making this statement, the Board has 
reviewed and discussed the overall process 
undertaken by management and has:
• Discussed and agreed key assumptions 
in the stress testing model used by 
management;
• Considered the Group’s current position 
and future prospects, the Group’s 
strategy and principal risks and how 
these are managed as detailed in the 
Strategic report;
• Assessed the outcome of the stress-
testing, carried out using the Group’s 
five-year strategic plan as the base 
case. The five-year strategic plan 
considers the Group’s cash flows, 
dividend cover, net debt:EBITDA 
covenant ratio and other key financial 
ratios over the period. These metrics 
are assessed against the Group Risk 
Register to determine the most 
impactful ones to stress test against, 
and this is carried out to evaluate the 
potential impact of the Group’s principal 
risks actually occurring;
• Considered the Group Risk Register to 
determine those risks which could 
potentially pose the most significant 
threat to viability across the Group over 
this period and which should be 
modelled, including:
 – A significant market downturn, of 
greater magnitude than both the 
after effects of 9/11 and the global 
recession in 2008. The downturn 
was assumed to last for the full 
stress testing period, impacting both 
civil aerospace and energy, with 
military being unaffected (as history 
has shown);
 – A decline commensurate with losing 
one of our most significant 
customers, leading to a sharp loss of 
revenue across the full stress testing 
period; and
 – A set of reverse engineered 
scenarios which deliberately just 
break covenants in our credit 
facilities or exceed our committed 
facilities to assess the headroom 
against our risk based scenarios.
• Assessed the likelihood of bank and 
other debt facilities continuing to be 
available to the Group as existing 
facilities mature over the next five years; 
• Specifically assessed the impact of the 
UK’s decision to leave the EU which is 
not expected to be significant, for three 
key reasons: 
 – From a trade perspective the WTO 
treaty for trade in civil aviation parts 
provides for tariff free trade (military 
is generally covered under separate 
trade arrangements), with non-tariff 
barriers not expected to threaten our 
ability to operate; 
 – Levels of trade between the UK and 
other EU countries is not especially 
significant to Meggitt (UK exports to 
the EU were 7% of Group revenues in 
2017, whilst imports to the UK from 
the EU were under 1%); and 
 – We have a significant amount of 
non-Sterling denominated revenue, 
costs and debt, meaning we have 
benefited from the weakening of 
Sterling since the UK’s decision to 
leave the EU. Remaining net 
transaction exposures are hedged 
forward giving us time to respond to 
further movements over time; and
• Specifically assessed the exposure to 
cross border trade, in relation to 
potential changes to import and export 
tariffs.
Based on the results of its review and as set 
out above, the directors have a reasonable 
expectation that the Group will be able to 
continue in operation and meet its liabilities 
as they fall due over the five-year period of 
their assessment. MEGGITT PLC

GOVERNANCE AND COMPLIANCE
Ultimately, the Board is responsible for 
implementation and performance of our 
Corporate Responsibility Policy. In 2017, 
the day-to-day responsibilities of the 
Board and the Chief Executive in relation 
to the Corporate Responsibility Policy 
were devolved: the Group Operations 
Director had functional responsibility 
for health, safety and the environment; 
the Executive Director, Commercial 
& Corporate Affairs had functional 
responsibility for trade compliance, 
ethics and business conduct, and charity 
and community activity: and the newly 
appointed Head of HR led initiatives 
focused on diversity and employee 
engagement. Divisional presidents 
and site directors are responsible for 
locally implementing Group policies and 
procedures. Group support is provided 
to ensure our businesses fulfil the 
requirements that are outlined in our 
Corporate Responsbility Policy which is 
available on our website.
Activity in 2017 
As part of our commitment to ensure 
the health, safety and well-being of our 
employees the Board approved a revised 
Health & Safety Policy in 2017, which 
is available on our website. The Board 
also set out its commitments towards 
creating a more inclusive and diverse 
organisation. One of the ways we are 
aiming to achieve this is through creating 
a High Performance Culture which, 
amongst other things helps managers 
and employees create an inclusive 
culture that promotes diversity (for more 
information on our High Performance 
Culture see page 21). To meet our UK 
statutory requirements we will also publish our 
gender pay gap data and we will use this along 
with other internal measures to monitor our 
progress on improving diversity. 
During 2017, we assessed our policies, due 
diligence processes and risks relating to the 
non-financial matters covered under the 
new non-financial reporting regulations. Our 
disclosures in this Corporate responsibility 
report, Principal risks and uncertainties 
report and the Strategic report as a whole 
constitute the Group non-financial reporting 
statement as referred to in section 414CA of 
the Companies Act 2006.
Throughout 2017, we have continued to work 
with our suppliers on implementing ethical 
practices and our second Modern Slavery 
Act statement will be made available on our 
website in Q1 2018. We have taken steps 
to reduce the number of intermediaries in 
our supply chain. We have also considered 
the impact of our payment practices on 
suppliers and will disclose our data in 2018 as 
required, to ensure we are compliant with the 
new UK legislation that aims to increase the 
transparency of large companies’ payment 
practices. We have also published our tax 
strategy policy on our website and reviewed 
our tax working practices impacted by the 
Criminal Finances Act 2017. 
Finally, we have taken steps in 2017 to prepare 
for the updated EU data protection laws 
coming into effect in May 2018, which largely 
affects our employee data (as a business to 
business Group).  MEGGITT PLC

Health and safety
We believe that a safe and healthy workplace 
is a fundamental right of all of our employees 
as well as a business imperative. As a Group, 
we strive to ensure our employees can lead 
safe, healthy and productive lives. We do this 
by actively promoting our Health & Safety 
policy and programme to help individuals 
safeguard themselves, their colleagues and 
visitors. 
We continue to ensure that health and 
safety measures are integrated into daily 
layered accountability meetings including 
standardising and improving how we 
report incidents and the actions we take to 
close out near miss and unsafe conditions 
identified by employees. We also implement 
industry leading health and safety practices 
by issuing new Meggitt Health and Safety 
Procedures applicable to all sites on topics 
that are relevant.
Throughout the year, we use various 
forms of communication channels to 
keep safety at the top of the minds of our 
employees each day, and this is our way 
of consistently communicating our core 
health and safety value – SAFETY FIRST. 
Health and safety communication activities 
include: our Weekly Safety Talks delivered 
at our daily operational meetings with all 
employees under the Meggitt Production 
System (MPS); regular Safety Alerts 
issued to all sites to share incidents and 
lessons learnt; internal health and safety 
bulletins; HSE Sharepoint site where we 
share best practices and guidance with all 
HSE professionals and technicians; and 
our new MC2 intranet site, which we look 
to continuously improve to help employees 
become more proactive in our accident 
prevention efforts and to promote and 
support our safety initiatives.
 
During 2017, we continued to promote our 
safety culture by conducting behaviour based 
safety training across all of our sites. The 
aim of the training is to focus each employee 
on their own behaviour, and to ensure 
employees feel responsible and accountable 
for identifying and mitigating risks in the 
workplace before an injury happens. 
To measure the effectiveness of our 
training, over the last couple of years we 
have measured leading indicators to focus 
employees on mitigating behaviours and 
conditions to reduce workplace injuries. 
This is in addition to our monitoring of the 
standard recordable and lost time incident 
rates, number of days lost due to workplace 
injury or illness and other lagging indicators 
typical in our industry to measure safety 
performance (performance targets for 2017 
are highlighted on page 49). In 2017, we 
also commenced tracking Total Recordable 
Data showing headcount by 
division, region and length of 
service as at 31 December 
2017 is outlined in the tables 
below.
We acknowledge our duty of care to our employees, and 
our responsibility to promote their health and safety in an 
inclusive environment free from discrimination. We also 
believe people should succeed by their talent, skill, 
knowledge and application. Highlighted below are steps 
we take to support our employees.

During 2017, 40% of our manufacturing 
facilities were reviewed by our 
comprehensive auditing programme for 
their compliance with applicable health and 
safety regulatory requirements as well as 
compliance against industry best practice 
standards, as required by our Meggitt 
Health and Safety Procedures. Our audit is a 
rolling-programme and so more sites will be 
audited in 2018. 
To enhance our programme in 2017, we 
introduced new internal assess and assist 
teams consisting of health, safety and 
environmental professionals. The new 
teams review sites for compliance with 
applicable laws and regulations in addition 
to compliance with more stringent Meggitt 
internal policies and procedures. They also 
help to share best practices across the 
Group. The development of these internal 
assessment teams has enabled us to review 
compliance on a more frequent basis. This 
supplements our internal as well as our 
external auditing programme which utilises 
third party consultants. 
Being proactive in health and safety at our 
sites is recognised through our Meggitt 
Safety Star award programme. In 2017, 
this included the Polymers & Composites 
sites that were acquired in 2015 which were 
given targets to achieve at least Gold Safety 
Star status – 90% achieved these targets. 
Overall, in 2017, 65% of our sites achieved 
our Platinum Safety Star - this is the highest 
level of achievement.
Our persistent focus in this area has meant 
we have seen significant improvements in 
reduced days lost due to workplace injury. 
Our improvements reflect good progress in 
our journey to health and safety excellence 
and we are targeting to achieve a TRIR of 
0.6 by 2019 which is best in class health and 
safety performance.

Human rights, diversity and equal 
opportunities
Our policy on human rights is contained 
within our Corporate Responsibility Policy, 
where we confirm the Board’s support for 
the Ten Principles outlined in the United 
Nations Global Compact. 
The Board is also committed to promoting 
diversity and equal opportunities in our 
organisation. As a Group, we support equal 
employment opportunities and oppose all 
forms of unlawful or unfair discrimination. 
We give full and fair consideration to all job 
applications and provide opportunities for all 
employees in training, career development 
and  promotion and continue wherever 
possible to continue to employ staff who 
become disabled. We recognise however that 
our policies are only as successful as their 
implementation and therefore we require all 
Meggitt employees to comply with our Ethics 
and Business Conduct Policy, our Corporate 
Responsibility Policy and Code of Conduct, 
which reinforces our values, to treat all 
colleagues fairly and with respect and to act 
with integrity in all of our business dealings. 
Our approach to diversity and inclusion was 
reviewed by the Board during 2017. The 
following actions and commitments have 
been identified to help us improve diversity 
and inclusion across Meggitt: 
(i) The creation of a High Performance 
Culture (HPC) across Meggitt. We 
recognise that developing the right 
culture is important and will ultimately 
help us to deliver sustainable high 
performance. Ultimately, HPC creates 
a set of concepts bound together by a 
common language to help managers 
and employees share and work 
towards the same strategic vision. 
Participation in HPC training to date 
has been encouraging with positive 
feedback from across the organisation 
(see pages 21 and 51).

(ii) Recognition that we are an 
international business and there will 
be varied challenges to building a truly 
inclusive business across different 
geographies. We will work with each of 
our divisions and functions to develop 
inclusion and diversity strategies that 
recognise their specific requirements 
and challenges. Local plans will be 
integrated into our overall Talent 
Management framework and reviewed 
regularly by the Executive Committee 
to ensure continual progress.
(iii) Understanding of employees’ 
perceptions. Our 2017 employee 
engagement survey captured 
responses on a range of issues 
including gender. We will use this data 
to formulate local action plans and to 
see if there are themes which we need 
to address. We will continue to collect 
feedback from employees to monitor 
perceptions on issues such as diversity 
and to help us focus our efforts in this 
area.
(iv) Awareness that all of our employees 
have requirements that can change 
because of circumstances. We 
recognise that we have an important 
role as a responsible employer in 
creating a culture that supports our 
employees in the various stages of their 
working lives. As part of this process 
we are reviewing our policies in areas 
such as recruitment, flexible working 
and maternity/paternity leave to 
ensure they align with our aspirations 
to create a truly diverse and inclusive 
organisation across all of the countries 
that we operate in.
The number of women employed at all 
levels of the workforce is set out in table

Employee consultation 
The Group regards employee 
communication as a vital business function 
and we respect all employee relations 
regulations. 
Our employees receive regular 
communication about business 
developments. This takes a variety of forms, 
including: presentations from the Chief 
Executive via audio-visual media; top-down 
strategy dissemination from the Chief 
Executive; publications such as the Meggitt 
Review; and a variety of electronically-
distributed newsletters.
Our results presentations are also 
disseminated across the Group to enhance 
our employees’ understanding of the 
financial and economic factors affecting its 
performance. 
Locally at site level, employee consultation 
is carried out at facilities by operations 
directors and other line managers via daily 
meetings on factory floors, all-employee 
‘Town Hall’ meetings, team briefings and 
works councils. 
As we appreciate that communication 
is two-way, we carried out an employee 
engagement survey in 2017. The feedback 
will be used to help shape policies and the 
development of our Group.
Employees are also encouraged to become 
shareholders to improve active participation 
in, and commitment to, the Group’s 
success. This policy has been pursued for 
all UK employees through the UK Share 
Incentive Plan and the Sharesave Scheme.

StrategIc r ep Ort
As a manufacturing business, we are 
committed to ensuring that all of our sites 
operate in full compliance with all applicable 
environmental laws and regulations and this 
is reinforced through our Environmental 
Policy and Corporate Responsibility Policy. 
We also require our manufacturing sites to 
maintain an environmental management 
system certified to the ISO 14001 
international standard.
Our commitment in this area is demonstrated 
by our compliance record which shows 
no fines for breaches of environmental 
regulations after numerous inspections by 
environmental authorities during 2017. This 
achievement is due in part to our persistent 
monitoring of sites against internal targets. In 
2017, our auditing programme assessed 40% 
of our sites for compliance with applicable 
regulatory requirements as well as compliance 
against industry best practice.
In 2017, our environmental auditing 
programme was further expanded and 
additional support was introduced provided 
via our assess and assist teams consisting 
of health, safety and environmental 
professionals. 
We have set new performance targets for 
environmental metrics (other than GHG 
emissions) in 2017 and we will monitor and 
report our performance against these going 
forward.
Performance
Table 1 on page 53, shows our performance 
against key internally set environmental 
metrics. Table 2 shows our GHG emissions 
data that we are required to report in 
accordance with legislation. Table 3 shows 
our progress on achieving internally set 
targets.
During 2017, we achieved a 2% reduction 
in GHG emissions relative to revenue, 
and a 7% reduction towards our 10 
year target to achieve a 25% reduction 
by 2025. Divestments, consolidations 
and footprint reduction activity of our 
businesses as well as numerous energy 
savings projects implemented at our sites 
in 2017 contributed to our positive GHG 
performance. 
ENVIRONMENT
We are committed to achieving and maintaining a culture 
that places a high priority on environmental performance 
and being proper stewards in the communities and 
locations in which we operate to minimise environmental 
impacts of our operations.
Corporate responsibility continued
Water consumption increased slightly due 
primarily to an increase in production, the 
installation of a new sprinkler system and 
a water main break at our MPC Rockmart 
facility which is our largest water consumer. 
Excluding Rockmart, most of our other 
facilities reduced their water consumption 
in 2017 through water conservation 
measures including installation of water 
recirculating systems. 
Waste generated in 2017 increased due 
to construction, demolition and site clean 
up activities which resulted in significant 
amounts of non-hazardous waste being 
generated, most of which had to be 
landfilled as there were no recycling options 
to pursue. Despite this, our sites continued 
to seek viable recycling options for standard 
waste generated. One example of this is a 
recycling and repurposing project at our 
UK Coventry facility for carbon cloth waste 
where material scraps are milled and then 
reconstituted into other non-aerospace 
and non-military carbon tube fittings and 
gaskets. Another example is our US MPC 
San Diego facility which now recycles a 
waste stream that is used for fuel. So far, 
they have diverted approximately 11.4 
metric tonnes per annum from going to 
landfill. Our US MSS Orange County facility 
also completed a project in late 2017 which 
eliminated a waste stream that generated 
approximately 143,000 litres per year of 
hazardous wastewater. 
Saving energy
In 2017, many of our sites implemented 
energy savings projects including upgrading 
facilities to energy efficient lighting, 
installing energy efficient compressors 
and occupancy and machine sensors 
and timers, upgrading building and 
ducting insulation and installing energy 
management systems which together 
continue to contribute to reduce our GHG 
emissions by approximately 1,500 tonnes 
per annum across the Group. 
In 2018 and beyond, we are looking to 
implement more energy savings projects 
that will have a positive impact on the 
energy use of our operations. One such 
project involves the planned replacement

of inefficient heated press platens with

that the electromagnetic platens 
reduce electrical use by 40% to 50%. In 
addition, the UK Ansty Park super site will 
consolidate several UK businesses into one 
new building that is being designed with 
modern energy efficiency technology in 
mind.

REACH
As our manufacturing sites use chemicals, 
we continue to monitor developments 
under the EU Registration, Evaluation, 
Authorisation of CHemicals (REACH) 
regulations. We do this through the 
Group’s REACH Steering Committee which 
consists of representatives from each 
strategic business unit. REACH regulates 
the production, use and communication of 
chemical substances throughout the supply 
chain and the potential impact on human 
health and the environment. The REACH 
Steering Committee meets at least quarterly 
to review regulatory developments and 
restrictions placed on chemical substances 
and how these may potentially impact 
our operations and products. In 2017, we 
implemented a monthly REACH newsletter 
that is distributed to all functional leaders 
at each of our business units to ensure that 
critical information regarding restrictions 
placed on materials used in our operations is 
communicated across the Group. 
We are also actively engaged in the US 
Aerospace Industry Association Chemical 
Subcommittee and in the Aerospace and 
Defence Industries Association of Europe 
(ASD) that review and provide input 
on proposed chemical restrictions and 
prohibitions. In 2017, we also joined the 
International Aerospace Environmental 
Group (IAEG) as a full member, and joined 
the Chemical Reporting Working Group. 
Our involvement in these industry trade 
group committees allows us to interact 
with several of our customers and suppliers 
on issues impacting the aerospace and 
defence industries as well as issues 
impacting our specific operating units. It 
also provides us a voice in how our industry 
will respond to ever changing and complex 
global environmental regulations. 
Obsolescence 
Through our Obsolescence Review Board we 
continually assess substances used in our 
operations and contained in our products 
to identify alternatives that are safer to use, 
and have less impact on the environment. 
We recognise that global environmental 
regulations will continue to have an impact 
on the availability of certain substances that 
are commonly used in our industry, and we 
have taken steps to manage this risk through 
chemical hazard assessments conducted at 
all of our business units. We have performed 
extensive reliability and qualification testing 
on potential safer alternatives to prioritise 
substances scheduled for restriction. For 
example, we have identified and qualified 
a non-chromate based primer which is 
currently being used in a number of our 
aircraft braking system components and have 
identified safer alternatives to chlorinated 
solvents previously used in some of our 
operations. We continue to work closely with 
our customers and suppliers to minimise the 
use of toxic substances in our manufacturing 
processes and in our products.  MEGGITT PLC

ETHICS
Ethics, business conduct and trade compliance
We recognise that conducting business relationships in an 
ethical and responsible manner and acting as a responsible 
supplier is critical for our success especially given the highly 
competitive nature of our industry.
Through industry associations like the 
Aerospace, Defence, Security and Space 
organisation (ADS) and the International 
Forum on Business Ethical Conduct 
(IFBEC), we have taken a leadership 
position with others in our industry when it 
comes to conducting business ethically and 
in compliance with laws and regulations. 
We run an Ethics Programme for all of 
our employees to ensure we are doing 
business ethically and we are compliant 
with international anti-corruptions laws. 
Our programme is built on the foundation 
of honesty, integrity and respect for others. 
These principles are reaffirmed through 
our Group policies including our Ethics and 
Business Conduct Policy, Code of Conduct 
and Anti-Corruption Policy. Through regular 
training in these policy areas, all employees 
are reminded of how to conduct business 
in an ethical and responsible manner and 
examples are given on how to apply the 
principles and provisions laid out in our 
policies. Every employee also receives a 
printed Ethics Guide on joining the Group 
which is also available on our website. 
Each Meggitt business site has a designated 
Ethics Coordinator who is available to assist 
employees who have questions or concerns 
and we operate an Ethics Line which 
enables employees to raise questions or 
concerns confidentially or anonymously, 24 
hours a day, 7 days a week from anywhere 
in the world. Employees are entitled to a 
thorough investigation and receive feedback 
whether the issues are substantiated or not.
Throughout 2017, we continued to promote 
our ethics programme through our anti-
bribery, code of conduct and personal 
integrity barometer training sessions. We 
also took steps to reduce the number of our 
commercial intermediaries to try to mitigate 
potential risks of corruption and bribery 
taking place within our business.
As part of our commitment to acting as 
a responsible supplier, we commit to 
abstaining from practices such as slavery, 
human trafficking, forced labour and 
child labour. We also commit to take all 
reasonable measures to ensure that our 
suppliers and other entities acting on our 
behalf do not engage in practices that 
violate applicable laws and regulations 
relating to slavery, human trafficking, forced 
labour and child labour. Our statement 
made in compliance with the UK Modern 
Slavery Act is available on our website.
In 2017, we met reporting requirements 
in relation to tax working practices and 
payment practices.
Our compliance with other relevant laws 
and employee training is monitored 
through our internal audit programme 
and the findings are reported to the Audit 
Committee and Board on a regular basis.
In addition to our ethics programme, we 
have a long established Trade Compliance 
function, who apply detailed processes 
and practices to ensure we are compliant 
with import and export regulations and 
with relevant economic sanctions. We 
continue to incorporate new regulatory 
requirements, especially those associated 
with the US Export Controls Reform (ECR) 
and to expand implementation of our global 
trade management software solutions 
to implement our import compliance 
programme.

Tomorrow’s generation
During 2017, MCS North Hollywood 
became the second of our sites to 
support the FIRST Robotics 
Competition programme. 
FIRST (For Inspiration and 
Recognition of Science and 
Technology) was founded in 1989 to 
inspire young people’s interest and 
participation in science and 
technology. It is now universally 
recognised as the leading, not-for-
profit STEM engagement 
programme for children worldwide. 
Supporting programmes like FIRST 
helps us to ensure there is a 
pipeline of talented young 
engineers. In return, students are 
encouraged to pursue education 
and careers in STEM-related fields. 
They are also inspired to become 
leaders and innovators, and helped 
to develop their 21st century 
work-life skills.
MABS, Akron
The charitable activities at our 
Akron site during 2017 demonstrate 
the breadth of activities that our 
sites get involved with in supporting 
the local communities where their 
business operates.
During 2017, the MABS Women in 
Leadership Group supported 
different charitable organisations 
that had connections with 
employees based on site. This was 
through organising various events 
and fund-raising activities.
The business also sponsored the 
All-American Soap Box Derby 
Educational Program. The aim of 
the programme is to encourage 
amongst other things youth 
education and leadership 
development, mentoring, innovation 
and entrepreneurship.
Employees from the MABS site also 
engaged in the United Way Day of 
Action. Employees joined in an  
8 hour away day at Summit County 
Education Initiative – a local 
organisation supporting families in 
poverty. This gave the employees a 
chance to understand and support 
local issues in the community. 
SOCIAL
Local communities and charitable donations
Although our Policy allows a broad range of 
charitable activity, our priority is to support 
charities or community organisations which 
focus on science, technology, engineering 
and mathematics education initiatives. 
Examples of our on-going support in this 
area include:
 
• Links with the University of Sheffield 
and sponsorship of the annual prize 
for the best Science and Engineering 
Foundation Year student in the 
Automated Controls and Systems 
Engineering department. 
• The Arkwright Scholarship which 
supports future engineers by 
facilitating work experience, mentoring 
and providing technical guidance 
on projects and advice on university 
selection and applications. 
• Our involvement in encouraging 
students to take up engineering as 
a career through IET’s Engineering 
Horizon Bursaries, which offers 
support to students who have faced 
obstacles or challenges and require 
financial support as well as work 
placements. 
• Sponsorship of the School’s Aerospace 
Challenge, which offers shortlisted 
16 to 18 year olds the chance to 
experience what the aerospace world 
has to offer in a five day Summer 
School at Cranfield University. 
Within our Group’s defined policy, each 
Meggitt business is ultimately responsible 
for agreeing and administering its own 
budget for charitable donations and 
sponsorships to ensure they have a positive 
impact on the local community or they 
support sectors in which their businesses 
operate. Yearly reports reveal the 
exceptional generosity of many employees 
who give time and money to a wide range of 
national and local initiatives. 
We encourage our sites to contribute to the communities in 
which our employees live and work and to enhance the well-
being of people living in our communities. This is reinforced 
through our charitable giving policy. The policy also 
encourages facilities to undertake activities and fundraising to 
benefit the health and welfare of military personnel and to 
support education initiatives, scholarships and competitions in 
science, technology, engineering and mathematics subjects.

CHAIRMAN’S 
INTRODUCTION
Sir Nigel Rudd
Chairman
The Board is committed to maintaining 
high standards of corporate governance, 
which are fundamental to discharging 
our responsibilities. It is my responsibility 
to ensure that Meggitt is governed 
and managed in the best interests of 
shareholders and wider stakeholders. This 
includes encouraging open discussion and 
constructive challenge. In this report, we set 
out our governance framework and explain 
how our activities as a Board throughout the 
year have supported our strategy.
Leadership
As part of the planned and continued 
evolution of the Board, there have been 
a number of Board changes in 2017. 
We announced in November 2017 that 
Tony Wood would be appointed as Chief 
Executive from 1 January 2018. Tony brings 
a wealth of industry knowledge, skills and 
extensive operational experience from his 
thirty years in the aerospace sector. His 
contribution as Chief Operating Officer 
has been outstanding and I know that he 
will be an excellent successor to Stephen. 
Most recently he held a number of senior 
management positions at Rolls-Royce 
plc during a sixteen year career, latterly 
as President, Aerospace. Stephen Young 
stepped down from the Board with effect 
from 31 December 2017 and will retire in 
April 2018 after a long career at Meggitt, 
initially as our Group Finance Director and 
then from 2013, as our Chief Executive.
Brenda Reichelderfer retired from her position 
as Non-Executive Director on 27 April 2017 
and was replaced by Nancy Gioia. Nancy, a 
US citizen and electrical engineer, joined Ford 
Motor Company in 1982 and worked there 
until 2014 in a number of senior roles across 
engineering and manufacturing operations. 
Nancy’s appointment enables the Board to 
retain critical US and engineering experience 
and her background in the fast-moving 
automotive industry is consistent with our 
focus on accelerating strategic initiatives and 
delivering further operational efficiencies to 
drive long term shareholder returns.
Effectiveness
The 2016 external board evaluation 
highlighted that although a lot of progress 
had been made on strategy, succession 
planning and risk management in prior 
years, there were further opportunities 
to improve.
• Every year executive management has 
made incremental improvements to the 
Group’s succession planning process 
and how it is presented to the Board. In 
the 2016 evaluation, the Board asked 
for more detail on the process and we 
had a thorough session on this in July 
2017, followed by a detailed review of the 
outcome by the Nominations Committee 
in November 2017.
• The Board asked for more of an external 
perspective on market trends in the 
annual strategy session, as a result 
of which, an independent consultant 
attended the session in September and 
discussed emerging aerospace trends 
with the Board.
“Tony brings a wealth of industry knowledge, skills and 
extensive operational experience from his thirty years in 
the aerospace sector. His contribution as Chief Operating 
Officer has been outstanding and I know that he will be an 
excellent successor to Stephen.” STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE OTHER INFORMATION

• Whilst executive management had improved this area 
significantly over the last five years, there were opportunities to 
improve further in 2017. We report the improvements made in 
2017 in the Risk management report (pages 40 to 45).
• A skills matrix was completed for the Board which links to the 
Group’s strategy, end markets and key areas of governance, risk 
and compliance. The matrix will be useful in succession planning 
for the non-executive directors.
The Board reviewed its own effectiveness in 2017 through an 
internal process and were satisfied with the outcome. There 
were discussions about succession and Board composition and 
the Board also reflected on the importance of ensuring the Chief 
Executive succession process was a success. There were also some 
requests relating to the annual Board schedule, for example, for 
external aerospace market experts to attend the Board annually.
Accountability
In 2017, the Audit Committee discussed the 2016 viability 
statement process and confirmed that it was appropriate to retain 
the same process for the 2017 viability statement. The impact of 
the UK’s vote to leave the European Union was taken into account 
in the assessment of viability. A description of the process and the 
resulting statement is set out in the Risk management report. That 
report also includes our annual confirmations on risk management 
and internal control.
At the start of the year we reviewed and responded to the Corporate 
Governance Reform Green Paper and are tracking the proposed 
UK Corporate Governance Code consultation and any resulting 
changes. We welcome the opportunity to further consider how we 
engage with our wider stakeholders.
The Audit Committee went through a well planned, detailed and 
rigorous audit tender process (for the audit of the financial year 
ending 31 December 2018) which is described in detail in the Audit 
Committee report. The Committee recommended that we retain 
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP (PwC) as auditor of the Group as a 
result of the tender process. PwC have been auditors of the Group 
since 2003 and will be subject to mandatory rotation in 2023. This 
appointment remains subject to approval by shareholders at the 
2018 AGM.
The Board has confirmed that this Annual Report is fair, balanced 
and understandable. You can find an explanation of the process we 
have used to make this determination on page 97.
Remuneration
In 2017 following our 2016 consultation with shareholders, 
shareholders approved our remuneration policy at our 2017 AGM, as 
a result of which we have amended our share plan rules to introduce 
a two year post vesting holding period for executive directors. The 
Remuneration Committee has also considered how to amend targets 
from ROTA to ROCE for executive directors in our share plans and 
details are shown in the Directors’ remuneration report.

Corporate governance report continued
Directors are encouraged to update their skills regularly and 
their training needs are assessed as part of the Board evaluation 
process. Their knowledge and familiarity with the Group is 
facilitated by access to senior management, reports on the 
business and site visits. Resources are available to all directors to 
develop and update their knowledge and capabilities.
Information and support
The Chairman is responsible for ensuring directors receive 
accurate, timely and clear information and is satisfied that effective 
communication, principally by the Chief Executive and Chief 
Financial Officer, is undertaken with shareholders.
The Board is supplied with the information it needs to discharge its 
duties. The Company Secretary is responsible for ensuring good 
information flows within the Board and Committees and between 
senior management and non-executive directors. The Board 
members have regular discussions about their information and 
support requirements and discuss the effectiveness of the annual 
Board schedule during the Board evaluation.
All directors have had access to the advice and services of the 
Company Secretary who is responsible to the Board for advising on 
all governance matters.
The Board allows all directors to take external independent 
professional advice at the Group’s expense.
Effectiveness
Composition
The Board considers it has a good balance of executive and 
non-executive directors, is of an appropriate size and has the 
independence, skills, experience and knowledge to enable the 
directors to discharge their respective duties and responsibilities 
effectively.
All non-executive directors are considered independent under 
the Code.
Board Committee disclosures:
• All non-executive directors are members of the Audit, 
Remuneration and Nominations Committees on appointment. 
Chairmanship of Committees is considered during discussions 
on composition and succession.
• No one other than Committee chairs and members are entitled 
to attend the meetings, although others can be invited.
• The Audit, Remuneration and Nominations Committees’ written 
terms of reference were reviewed and updated in 2016 and 2017 
by the Board and are available on the investor section of our 
website.
• All Committee chairs report orally on the proceedings of their 
Committee at the next meeting of the Board when members 
of the Board are present who were not in attendance at the 
Committee meetings. Where appropriate, the Committee chairs 
make recommendations to the Board on appropriate matters.
Further details of the composition and activities of these 
Committees are set out in the separate Committee reports. 
Appointments and time commitment
There is a formal, rigorous and transparent procedure for 
the appointment of new directors which was reviewed by the 
Nominations Committee after the 2016 Board evaluation. Full 
details of the process for appointments made during the year are 
available in the Nominations Committee report set out on pages 69 
to 71. The appointment and removal of the Company Secretary is a 
matter for the Board.
The letters of appointment for the Chairman and non-executive 
directors set out the time they are expected to commit 
The Chairman and non-executive directors may undertake 
several appointments, which require approval of the Board 
and are reported on pages 58 and 59. The Board is aware of 
over-boarding guidelines set out by institutional shareholder 
advisory organisations, and considers these when discussing 
new appointments.
During 2017, except as indicated on page 61, the Chairman and  
non-executive directors attended all scheduled Board and 
Committee meetings and visited a number of Meggitt sites. The 
Chairman had regular meetings with the Chief Executive and 
attended shareholder meetings about governance and represented 
Meggitt and our interests at other events. The Chairman and Senior 
Independent Director have reviewed the time commitment of the 
Chairman and non-executive directors in 2017 and consider they 
have devoted an appropriate amount of time to Meggitt for the 
activities and issues that arose during the year. There were no 
changes to the Chairman’s significant commitments during the year.
Development
The Chairman agrees a personalised approach to the training 
and development of each director and reviews this regularly. The 
Company Secretary, who facilitates the induction of new directors 
and assists with professional development where required, 
continues to enhance the induction process following feedback 
from directors.

Board performance evaluation
In order to evaluate its own effectiveness, the Board undertakes 
annual effectiveness reviews using a combination of independent 
externally facilitated and internally run evaluations over a three-year 
cycle.

Internal Board evaluation planning by the Chairman and 
Company Secretary. The questionnaires are designed and cover 
new areas annually as appropriate. 
December 2017/January 2018
Questionnaires issued to the Board members. The Board 
effectiveness questionnaire posed questions in the following 
areas ranked on a scale of 1 to 3 (with space for comments):
• How well the strategy process works and the Board’s 
understanding of the core business and markets
• To what extent Board meetings are engaging with high quality 
discussion and open debate and whether all Board members 
contribute to discussions and work together well
• Whether the skills and experience on the Board are 
appropriate
• How the Board responds to challenges
• Whether the Chairman’s leadership style and tone is effective 
and how he works with the Chief Executive

• If the recruitment and induction processes are working well
• Whether risk management is undertaken appropriately
• If succession planning is working well

A detailed discussion is held by the Board on their responses to 
the questionnaire and resulting actions are agreed.
Board evaluation in 2017
Following the successful conclusion of the 2016 externally 
facilitated evaluation, several improvement activities were 
undertaken as described in the introduction to this report.
In 2017, the Board evaluated its own effectiveness, together 
with the effectiveness of the Chairman, individual directors, its 
Committees, auditors and remuneration advisers. The effectiveness 
reviews covered strategy, risk management, the annual Board 
schedule, composition, succession, appointment process, diversity, 
remuneration, audit and open channels of communications. The 
evaluation was carried out by way of questionnaire with open 
and closed questions, with follow up questions asked for clarity if 
needed.
The Board reviewed its own effectiveness in 2017 through an 
internal process, and were satisfied with the outcome. There  
were discussions about succession and Board composition and  
the Board also reflected on the importance of ensuring the  
Chief Executive succession process was a success. There were also 
some requests relating to the annual Board schedule, for example, 
for external aerospace market experts to attend the Board annually.
Relations with shareholders
The Board communicates with private investors via direct 
communication with the Company Secretary and the Vice 
President, Strategy & Investor Relations and content distributed or 
made available on the investor relations section of our website and 
at the AGM (see below).
Effective communication with fund managers, institutional 
investors and analysts about the Group’s strategy, performance 
and policies is promoted by meetings involving, principally, the 
Chief Executive and Chief Financial Officer. The Board receives 
and discusses reports from the Chief Executive and Chief Financial 
Officer and the Vice President, Strategy & Investor Relations on 
the views of shareholders. The Chairman and other non-executive 
directors are available to attend meetings with shareholders. 
Directors’ understanding of major shareholders’ views is enhanced 
by reports from the Vice President, Strategy & Investor Relations, 
our brokers and attending analysts’ briefings. Analysts’ notes on the 
Group are made available to all directors.
Shareholder documents
We provide annual reports and other documents to shareholders in 
their elected format under the electronic communications provisions 
approved by shareholders at our AGM in 2007. Electronic copies of 
this Annual Report and Accounts 2017 and the Notice of AGM will be 
posted on our website, with announcements, press releases and other 
investor information, including an analysis of ordinary shareholders by 
size of holdings and shareholder type. Corporate governance report continued

INVESTOR RELATIONS ACTIVITY,  
2017 HIGHLIGHTS
Feb 2017
The Preliminary results presentation took place 
on 28 February 2017 and included an overview 
of the 2016 full year financial performance of the 
business. This was presented by Stephen Young, 
Doug Webb and Tony Wood.
At this presentation we provided guidance on 
the outlook for the business in 2017 and covered 
progress made against strategy in 2016 and the 
medium-term goals for the Group.
April 2017
We engaged with ISS (Institutional Shareholder 
Services), IVIS (Institutional Voting Information 
Service) of the Investment Association and Glass 
Lewis before and after the AGM. 
May 2017
A capital markets day was held covering the 
detailed operational review undertaken by Tony 
Wood including commentary on outlook and 
operating targets. The day also covered updates 
from Customer Services & Support and on 
the Meggitt Production System as well as an 
overview of our strategy implementation around 
portfolio, customers, competitiveness and 
culture. The presentation materials are available 
on the investor page on our website.
2017 
The Chairman met with a number of major 
shareholders to discuss matters relating to the 
governance and strategy of the business. We 
continue to offer these meetings annually.
Investor Roadshows took place in the UK 
(London and Edinburgh) and the US (East 
and West Coast) immediately following the 
preliminary and interim results presentations 
in February and August. Shareholders had the 
opportunity to discuss financial performance 
and future strategy with senior management and 
investor relations. Throughout the year Meggitt 
also attended numerous sell-side conferences 
and mini-roadshows ensured shareholders and 
investors in regions globally (including Japan, 
UAE, Singapore, Switzerland, Germany and 
France) had the opportunity to hold meetings.
Annual General Meeting
At the AGM to be held on 26 April 2018, in addition to the routine 
business, shareholder consent will be sought for resolutions which give 
the Company authority to:
• convene general meetings on 14 clear days’ notice in accordance 
with the Articles (on the terms set out in the Notice of Meeting). 
The shorter notice period would not be used as a matter of routine 
for such meetings, but only where time-sensitive matters are to 
be discussed and where merited in the interests of shareholders 
as a whole. The directors also intend to follow other best practice 
recommendations as regards this authority’s use.
• to dis-apply pre-emption rights for up to 10% of issued share  
capital in accordance with the latest guidance from the UK  
Pre-Emption Group. The first resolution will seek authorisation 
for 5% of the issued share capital to be issued without application 
of pre-emption rights. The second resolution seeks authority for 
an additional 5% of the issued share capital to be used for an 
acquisition or a specified capital investment of a kind contemplated 
by the Statement of Principles most recently published by the UK 
Pre-Emption Group. The latter resolution received a vote against 
in excess of 20% at the 2017 AGM. The Board have considered 
shareholder feedback on this topic but continue to believe that, 
in order for the Board to have full strategic flexibility where 
acquisitions and capital investments are concerned, it continues 
to be appropriate to request this authority from shareholders. 
In asking shareholders to approve this additional authority, the 
directors confirm that they intend to adhere to the requirements 
set out in the Statement of Principles. 
All directors are subject to election by shareholders at their first 
AGM after their appointment. After that, all directors are subject to 
re-election annually to comply with the UK Corporate Governance 
Code. All directors in office at the date of the AGM will be subject to 
re-election.
UK Corporate Governance Code – December 2017 
consultation
The Board has considered the proposed changes to the UK Corporate 
Governance Code. Once the changes have been finalised, the Board 
will review which processes, procedures, approaches and activities 
need to be changed and will provide a further update in the 2018 
Annual Report. 
Statement of compliance
Throughout the financial year ended 31 December 2017 and to the 
date of this report, we have complied with the provisions set out in 
the UK Corporate Governance Code 2016 (the Code) published by 
the Financial Reporting Council (FRC). The Group has applied all the 
main and supporting principles set out in the Code and explanations 
are included in this report and in the Audit Committee, Nominations 
Committee and the Directors’ remuneration reports. The information 
required under Disclosure Guidance and Transparency Rule 7.2.6 is

“In 2017 , the Committee conducted a rigorous audit tender 
process, as a result of which we are recommending to 
shareholders at out 2018 AGM that PwC be reappointed as 
external auditors for the 2018 financial year.”
Colin Day
Chairman of the Audit Committee
CHAIRMAN’S INTRODUCTION
I am pleased to present the report of the 
Audit Committee for 2017.
I chair the Audit Committee and as a Fellow 
of the Association of Chartered Certified 
Accountants, and previous Chief Executive 
Officer of Essentra plc and Chief Financial 
Officer of Reckitt Benckiser Group plc, I 
can confirm that I bring recent and relevant 
financial experience to the Committee.
Committee members throughout 2017 were 
Guy Berruyer, Alison Goligher and Paul 
Heiden. Brenda Reichelderfer retired from 
the Board and this Committee and Nancy 
Gioia was appointed in April 2017.
By invitation, there were a number of 
other regular attendees including the 
Chief Financial Officer, the Group Financial 
Controller and the internal and external 
auditors. The Chairman of the Board, the 
Chief Executive, Chief Operating Officer 
and the Executive Director, Commercial & 
Corporate Affairs also attended meetings 
by invitation.
The Committee’s key role is to engender 
confidence in the integrity of our processes 
and procedures relating to internal financial 
control and corporate reporting. The Board 
relies on the Committee to review financial 
reporting and to appoint and oversee the 
work of the internal and external auditors.
In 2017, as well as routine Committee 
activity, the Committee conducted a 
rigorous audit tender process, as a result 
of which the Committee is recommending 
to shareholders at the 2018 AGM that PwC 
be reappointed as external auditors for the 
financial year ending 31 December 2018. 
There is a detailed commentary on the 
audit tender process provided in this report, 
together with a description of the work of the 
Committee in 2017. It included advising the 
Board on whether these accounts are fair, 
balanced and understandable, reviewing the 
work carried out by executive management 
on the viability statement and oversight of 
the risk management process.

EXTERNAL AUDIT TENDER
A timetable for the audit tender was agreed in 2016 and in July 
2017 there was a detailed discussion:
• The Committee considered a paper prepared by 
management setting out legal guidance and best practice 
relating to an audit tender process. The process conformed 
to the legal guidance and most areas of best practice. The 
Chairman of the Committee attended all presentations, and 
a process was designed to allow each Committee member to 
fully participate in the selection decision.
• The Committee agreed to invite Deloitte, EY, KPMG and PwC 
to participate in the tender process. Consideration was given 
to extending the shortlist to include mid-size firms, however 
it was concluded it was not appropriate given the scale and 
complexity of the Group.
• Agreed a draft RFP which had been benchmarked against 
other practical examples and best practice guidance.
• Agreed a timetable of meetings to allow the tender firms to 
gain an understanding of the Group and its processes. In 
addition to meeting with the Committee Chairman, meetings 
were held with the Chief Executive, Chief Financial Officer, 
Executive Director, Commercial and Corporate Affairs, Group 
Financial Controller, Chief Information Officer, Group Head of 
Audit & Risk, Head of Treasury & Tax, Head of Finance Shared 
Service Centre and two of the divisional finance directors.
• Given the level of the Group’s US operations, agreed that 
each firm must ensure the audit presentations were attended 
by both the UK lead engagement partner and the firm’s lead 
US partner(s).
The RFP was issued to each of the four participating firms in 
early August 2017. All four firms:
• Met with the individuals identified above;
• Had access to a data room providing background on the  
Group;
• Provided written responses to two technical questions set by 
management;
• Submitted a formal RFP response to the Committee; and
• Presented to the Group Selection Committee.
The Group Selection Committee reviewed and discussed the 
strengths and weaknesses of each firm and, at the conclusion of 
the process, the Committee recommended its first and second 
choice firm to the Board. The Committee identified PwC as 
its preferred appointment, supported by clear and compelling 
reasoning. PwC has a track record of delivering an audit to a high 
standard, with each partner rotation bringing new insight, and 
the proposed lead partner had demonstrated that this would 
continue. Senior members of the audit team were generally 
highly regarded. During the tender process the quality of their 
written responses had been excellent and performance in 
meetings with the Committee Chairman and senior management 
had been strong. The Committee agreed that the current PwC 
audit approach was robust and effective and that they had 
performed consistently well in the tender process.
COMMITTEE ACTIVITIES
Updates and reports
• Received reports from internal audit at each meeting, 
discussed significant items and the effectiveness of internal 
audit, and approved the 2018 internal audit plan.
• Received a tax update from the Head of Treasury & Tax.
• Received technical accounting and governance updates 
provided by the Group Financial Controller, Company 
Secretary and the external auditors. This included a 
presentation from the Group Financial Controller on IFRS 
15, the new revenue accounting standard that becomes 
effective for the Group in 2018. The Committee discussed 
with management its process to date, preliminary 
conclusions and implementation plan.
Approved
• Negotiated and approved the 2017 external audit fees.
• The internal audit plan for 2018.
Reviewed
• Reviewed the financial information contained in the 2016 
Annual Report and Accounts, 2016 full year and 2017 interim 
results announcements and recommended them to the 
Board for approval.
• Reviewed the independence and effectiveness of the external 
auditors, and agreed their terms of engagement.
• Reviewed the adequacy and effectiveness of: (i) the systems 
of internal control; (ii) the risk management process; and 
(iii) the process executive management used to enable the 
Board to make the viability statement.
• Reviewed the effectiveness of the Committee and external 
and internal audit using the process described on page 68. 
There were no specific actions to take and the Committee 
confirmed it was satisfied with the outcome of the evaluation.
• Reviewed the results of internal audit activity for 2017.
• Discussed the external auditor’s strategy memorandum and 
interim audit clearance report for 2017.
• Conducted an external audit tender process and 
recommended PwC be reappointed for the 2018 financial 
year.
Since the year end, the Committee has discussed the external 
auditor’s final audit clearance report for 2017; reviewed the 
financial information contained in the 2017 Annual Report and 
Accounts and full year results announcement and recommended 
them to the Board for approval; and provided advice to the Board 
that the 2017 Annual Report and Accounts, taken as a whole, is 
fair, balanced and understandable. The Committee provided this 
advice having reviewed management’s process and confirmed its 
output, and provided confirmation to the Board that this process 
was effective.
The Committee also recommended that the Board approve the 
viability and going concern statements, having overseen the 
viability and going concern statements process throughout the 
year (as described on page 45). STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE OTHER INFORMATION

FRC Thematic Review
The Committee received feedback from the Financial Reporting Council (FRC) following inclusion of Meggitt in its thematic review of 2016 
disclosures of significant estimates and judgements. Other than a couple of areas of disclosure which the FRC noted may not be required 
on materiality grounds, no adverse comments were raised. Additionally, the FRC included three areas of the Group’s disclosures as 
examples of best practice within its final report.
Significant estimates and judgements relating to the financial statements
The table below summarises the significant estimates and judgements reviewed by the Committee in respect of the Group’s financial 
statements.
Area Action
Goodwill The principal judgements are management’s determination of the level at which impairment testing 
should be performed, the achievability of business plans (and therefore future cash flows), growth rates 
beyond the period covered by the five-year business plans and the appropriateness of the discount 
rates applied to future cash flows. The Committee discussed a report from management setting out the 
basis for the assumptions, confirmation that the cash flows used were derived from the 2018 budget 
and strategic plan (which in their role as members of the Board, Committee members had previously 
reviewed), a sensitivity analysis on key assumptions and an analysis of the headroom at each significant 
level at which testing was performed, with a particular focus on MABS, EDAC/Advanced Composites 
and Meggitt Training Systems as these had the least headroom measured on a percentage basis. The 
Committee agreed with the judgements made by management. 
Impact of cancellation of the 
Dassault Falcon 5X programme
The Committee considered a report from management describing the impairment test performed 
following cancellation by the customer of the Falcon 5X programme, and announcement of a new Falcon 
aircraft. Discussions with management focused on those areas of the report covering the contractual 
position with the customer, the extent to which any costs capitalised prior to cancellation related to 
technologies which potentially were transferrable to the new aircraft and the level of rework that would 
be expected to be required, noting that this was very dependent on the final design of the new aircraft 
for which there remains a significant level of uncertainty. The Committee also discussed the impacts 
of the delayed entry into service and lack of reliable third party fleet forecasts for the new aircraft. The 
Committee agreed with management that it was appropriate to record a full impairment loss against the 
balances on the programme.
Development costs The Committee discussed a report from management covering exposure to different aircraft platforms 
and manufacturers and a sensitivity analysis on specific programmes. The Committee focused in 
particular on the Bombardier CSeries, Embraer 450/500, Bombardier Global 7000/8000, Gulfstream 
G500/G600 and Irkut MC-21 in light of the material values capitalised on these platforms. The 
Committee concluded that assumptions made by management were reasonable and the carrying value 
and estimated useful lives of the assets were appropriate.
Provision for environmental 
matters relating to historic
sites and related insurance and 
other receivables
The Committee discussed a report from management setting out the basis for the judgements made and 
the extent to which these were supported by third party specialist advice. The Committee discussed with 
management the sensitivity of amounts recorded to increases in cost estimates and delays to the timing 
of clean-up activities, including the impact on insurance policy limits and insurance policy periods of 
cover. The Committee agreed with the judgements made by management.
Retirement benefit obligations The Committee considered a report from management setting out the basis on which assumptions on 
mortality, inflation and the rates at which scheme liabilities are discounted had been determined, how the 
Group’s assumptions used in its 2016 financial statements benchmarked against those disclosed by other 
large corporate entities in the UK and US and the sensitivity of amounts recorded in the balance sheet and 
income statement to changes in these assumptions. The Committee concluded that the assumptions used, 
which were supported by third party actuarial advice, were appropriate.
Income taxes Judgements have to be made by management on the tax treatment of a number of transactions in advance 
of the ultimate tax determination being known. In assessing the appropriateness of the provision recognised 
in respect of uncertain tax positions, the Committee considered a report from management setting out the 
basis for the assumptions made. They discussed the assumptions in light of the current tax environment 
and the status of tax audits in the main jurisdictions in which the Group operates. The Committee concluded 
that the position taken on uncertain tax provisions was appropriate.
Treatment of items excluded 
from underlying profit 
measures
The Committee discussed the treatment and disclosure of amounts included within exceptional operating 
items and merger and acquisition (M&A) related items. For 2017, the Committee agreed, given its 
significance, that the impact of the cancellation of the Dassault Falcon 5X programme was appropriately 
treated as an exceptional operating item. The Committee also agreed with management that the full 
impact on deferred tax net liabilities of the reduction in the US federal corporate tax rate should be 
excluded from underlying profit measures, even though an element related to amounts previously 
recorded in underlying profit at the higher tax rates. The Committee noted the items reflected the way in 
which they, as members of the Board, reviewed the underlying performance of the Group, were treated 
consistently year on year (other than the Dassault Falcon 5X and US tax rate reduction which only related 
to 2017) and were disclosed appropriately. Audit Committee report continued

Key areas of oversight
External audit
The external auditors are PwC who were appointed for the financial 
year commencing 1 January 2003 after a competitive tender. There 
are no contractual obligations restricting the Committee’s choice of 
external auditors.
The lead audit partner is Andrew Paynter whose appointment in 
this role commenced with the audit for the financial year ended 
31 December 2013. Mr Paynter has had no previous involvement 
with the Group in any capacity. The external audit was subject to a 
rigorous tender process in 2017 as described above, the outcome 
of which is that PwC has been reappointed and the audit partner will 
rotate to John Ellis for the 2018 year end. The mandatory rotation of 
auditor under EU rules does not take place until 2023.
The Committee routinely meets PwC without executive management 
present and no concerns have been raised. It was confirmed that the 
external auditors had been able to offer rigorous and constructive 
challenge to executive management during the year.
As well as considering the outcome of the audit tender process, 
the Committee also assessed the effectiveness of PwC and the 
external audit process using a questionnaire and a Committee 
discussion on responses to the questionnaire. The Committee 
was satisfied with PwC’s performance, that PwC had employed 
an appropriate level of professional challenge in fulfilling their 
role and there were no significant findings from the process. The 
Committee determined, on the basis of the satisfactory outcome 
of the evaluation and as a result of the audit tender process during 
which PwC were reselected, to recommend that the Board submit 
the reappointment of PwC to shareholders for approval at the AGM 
in 2018 for the 2018 financial year.
Non-audit services
The Group places great importance on the independence of its 
external auditors and is careful to ensure their objectivity is not 
compromised. The Committee agrees fees paid to external auditors 
for their services as auditors and is required to approve, in advance, 
any fees to the external auditors for non-audit services in excess of 
£0.1 million.
Details of fees paid for audit services, audit-related services and 
non-audit services can be found in note 7 to the Group consolidated 
financial statements. Fees paid for non-audit services in 2017 were 
less than £0.1 million (3% of the total audit fee) and average fees 
paid for non-audit services for the last three years to 2017 were 
less than £0.1 million (2% of the total audit fee over that period). 
Fees paid for non-audit services related to services allowed to be 
provided by PwC under the Group’s policy on non-audit services.
The Group’s policy on non-audit services covers services that 
can be provided and those which are generally prohibited (for 
example internal audit services and tax planning) and sets out 
the procedures for approving non-audit services. The full policy is 
available on our website (under Audit Committee in the Governance 
section).
The Committee is satisfied that the overall levels of audit-related 
and non-audit fees are not material to the PwC office conducting 
the audit, or PwC as a whole, and therefore the objectivity and 
independence of the external auditors was not compromised.
Internal audit
The Audit Committee agrees the annual internal audit plan which 
is developed according to a risk assessment process and ensures 
adequate resources are available to execute the plan. The risk 
assessment process initially divides our business units into three 
tiers determined by financial measures. Tier 1 businesses are 
visited annually, with Tier 2 businesses visited every other year and 
Tier 3 businesses every third year. This is then subject to a further 
discretionary risk based adjustment if there are circumstances 
which suggest a business unit should have an audit accelerated. 
Reasons for this can include adverse prior audit findings, a change 
in IT system, site moves, senior leadership changes or operational 
performance issues.
In 2017, internal audits were carried out for 38 Group locations, 
including the UK and US finance and payroll shared service centres, 
as part of the rotational audit cycle. The business unit audit 
programme’s scope includes finance, programme management, HR/
payroll, sales agents/distributors and commercial bid & proposal 
activity. The scope of internal audit continues to develop with the 
business, particularly as a result of any acquisition and disposal 
activity. A key role of the Audit Committee is to monitor the level of 
internal audit resource to ensure it remains appropriate as both the 
Group and function evolve.
In addition to the site-based business unit reviews, internal audit has 
a co-source arrangement with Grant Thornton UK LLP to assist with 
resourcing specialist audits, such as IT, tax and treasury. The Audit 
Committee remains cognisant of increasing cyber complexity and 
associated risks. The approach for 2017 was to deliver these reviews 
using subject matter experts based around four core strategic IT 
areas: programmes, operations, fix-the-fundamentals and security.
The results of the audits are regularly discussed with the Head of 
Internal Audit and Risk by the Chairman of the Audit Committee 
between Audit Committee meetings. At each meeting, the 
Committee receives a status update on the internal audit 
programme, discusses and challenges any significant issues arising 
and monitors implementation by the business of recommendations 
made.
The Audit Committee routinely meets internal audit without executive 
management present. No concerns have been raised and it was 
confirmed that the internal auditors had been able to carry out their 
work and offer constructive challenge to executive management 
during the year. The Audit Committee considered the effectiveness of 
internal audit in 2017 and confirmed that they continue to be satisfied. 
For 2018 an independent effectiveness review has been commissioned 
by the Audit Committee, supported by Group management, as part of 
their ongoing assessment processes.
Whistleblowing
The Ethics and Trade Compliance Committee is responsible for 
oversight and review of the process for handling allegations from 
whistleblowers. Whistleblowing is included in our Ethics and 
Business Conduct Policy and Code of Conduct, which is available 
on our website. The Group sponsors an independently operated 
and monitored Ethics Line, enabling employees to report concerns 
about possible misconduct, with proportionate and independent 
investigation and appropriate follow-up action.
Compliance with Audit Services Order
We comply with the Competition and Market Authority Order 2014 
relating to audit tendering and the provision of non-audit services, 
as discussed further above.

all colleagues working within Meggitt.”
Sir Nigel Rudd
Chairman of the Nominations Committee
CHAIRMAN’S INTRODUCTION
The Nominations Committee plays a leading 
role in assessing the balance of skills and 
experience on the Board and the Group’s 
principal committees. The Committee 
identifies the roles and capabilities required 
to meet the demands of the business and 
ensures that a succession plan is in place. 
Candidates continue to be considered on 
merit against specific criteria determined by 
the Committee.
The Committee is comprised of the  
Non-Executive Chairman and the 
non-executive directors. During the year, 
the Committee had a detailed session 
on succession planning for executive 
management and reviewed and approved a 
skills matrix for the Board.
All Board level appointment decisions 
were made following a search process 
using executive search firm The Zygos 
Partnership. The Zygos Partnership assists 
with other senior executive searches below 
Board level, but has no other connection 
with the Group.
Responsibilities
The Committee reviews the structure, 
size and composition (including the skills, 
knowledge, experience and diversity) of 
the Board and, in consultation with the 
directors, makes recommendations to the 
Board on any proposed changes. Decisions 
on Board changes are taken by the Board 
as a whole. In performing its duties, the 
Committee has access to the services of the 
Company Secretary and may seek external 
professional advice at the Group’s expense.

CHIEF EXECUTIVE SUCCESSION
In 2017, after a long career 
at Meggitt, Stephen Young 
expressed his desire to retire but 
committed to continue his role 
until his replacement had been 
identified.
The search to recruit and 
appoint a new Chief Executive 
was undertaken by the Nominations Committee, supported by 
Zygos and led by myself as Committee Chairman. A structured 
timetable was agreed for the process which included regular 
discussions and support from the Remuneration Committee. 
The Committee reviewed and approved a job specification for 
the role to ensure it captured the key skills, experience and 
requirements. A short list of external candidates was reviewed 
by the Committee. After significant discussion, and taking into 
account his progress at Meggitt since his appointment as Chief 
Operating Officer in November 2016, Tony Wood was identified 
as the preferred candidate.
The Committee believed Tony’s extensive industry knowledge, 
skills and operational experience; gained during a thirty one 
year career with Rolls-Royce plc and Messier-Dowty would be 
crucial as the Group continued to support customers during an 
unprecedented period of ramp-ups on their new programmes. 
The Committee considered his vision and proven track record in 
the aerospace sector were important to further accelerate the 
Meggitt growth story and strategic initiatives already underway.
The Committee unanimously recommended to the Board 
the final selection of Tony and on 14 November 2017 we were 
pleased to announce Tony’s appointment as Chief Executive 
with effect from 1 January 2018.

the identification and development of employees with the potential 
to fill key business leadership positions in the Group. In July 2017, 
the Board reviewed the succession planning process. In November, 
the Board reviewed detailed executive succession plans for each 
division and function with the Group HR Director, including plans 
for the executive directors and each member of the Executive 
Committee and other high potential individuals around the Group. 
Each individual on the succession plan has regular performance 
reviews and individual development plans.
Board composition and succession for the Chairman and 
non-executive directors is regularly discussed by the Committee. STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE OTHER INFORMATION

Diversity policy
The Board confirms a strong commitment to diversity (including, 
but not limited to, gender diversity) at all levels of the Group. 
The Board’s policy on diversity commits Meggitt to creating and 
sustaining a positive and supportive environment for all colleagues 
working within Meggitt. The environment should be one where 
all colleagues are equally valued and respected and within which 
individuals can thrive. The environment should be fair, equitable and 
mutually supportive. The objectives of this policy are to:
• create an inclusive and diverse environment reflective of our 
core values, in particular acting with integrity;
• ensure we always value, respect and promote the rights, 
responsibilities and dignity of employees within all our activities 
and relationships and equality of opportunity based on merit;
• ensure we have policies and processes which reflect a diverse 
and inclusive working environment;
• ensure the selection and appointment process for employees 
and directors includes a diverse range of candidates from 
diverse backgrounds; and
• ensure all employees, regardless of age, gender, or educational 
and professional backgrounds, can reach executive leadership 
positions based on merit.
We are also committed to disclosing statistics on gender diversity 
annually and disclosing our overall approach to inclusion and 
diversity in the Annual Report.
Based on the current size and composition of the Board and taking 
into account current succession plans, the Board has determined 
that there should be a minimum of two female directors, which is 
currently the case. The Board remains committed to ensuring that 
the directors bring a diverse range of skills, knowledge, experience, 
backgrounds and perspectives. Our directors are from the UK, US 
and France, and have a range of different skills and experience. 
There are currently no specific targets for the number of diverse 
candidates on our Executive Committee, but we do have a detailed 
strategy to improve diversity at all levels of the Company which is 
disclosed in the Corporate responsibility report. In terms of policy 
outcomes, the Corporate responsibility report also provides details 
of our 2017 gender diversity metrics.

DIRECTORS’ 
REMUNERATION 
REPORT
CHAIRMAN’S INTRODUCTION  
AND ANNUAL STATEMENT
It is my pleasure to present the Directors’ remuneration report
for the year ended 31 December 2017.
Pay philosophy
Executive remuneration packages at Meggitt are designed to 
attract, motivate and retain directors of a high calibre, to recognise 
the international nature of the Group’s business and to reward the 
directors for delivering value to shareholders through sustainable 
performance for our customers. 
The package aligns with our strategy (see below), is clear and 
transparent, and incentive plans aim to provide all participants 
with performance metrics which are relevant to their daily 
work. The package targets fixed pay at market competitive 
levels to companies of a similar size and with similar operating 
characteristics, supplemented by performance-related annual 
bonuses and an equity-based long term incentive plan designed to 
reward and incentivise growth.

2017 activity
The 2016 Directors’ remuneration report and revised Remuneration Policy were submitted to shareholders for approval at our 2017 AGM, 
gaining an approval rating of 96.57% and 90.34% respectively. The Committee reviewed its Terms of Reference and updated them to reflect 
the new Executive Committee structure. We also finalised the effectiveness review of the Committee and Mercer, our advisers, which was 
carried out using questionnaires and through Committee discussion. Overall, the ratings for the Committee and Mercer were satisfactory 
and no significant areas were highlighted for improvement. 
We approved awards under the LTIP and confirmed the vesting outcomes of the STIP award for 2016 and LTIP awards made in 2014. 
Since the year end, we have approved performance targets for the 2018 STIP and LTIP awards which are detailed in this report, agreed the 
salaries for the executive directors, the fee for the Chairman, and confirmed the vesting outcome of the 2017 STIP and 2015 LTIP awards. 
On 1 January 2018, Tony Wood was appointed as Chief Executive. His service contract had originally been approved in 2016 when he 
was appointed as Chief Operating Officer, and so was amended primarily to take account of his new role and increase in salary. All other 
benefits except salary remain the same as Mr Wood was already an executive director. In deciding Mr Wood’s new salary of £650,000, 
the Committee took into account the size and responsibilities of the role, Mr Wood’s extensive industry experience and market data for 
comparable roles, among other factors. His salary will not be eligible for an increase in April 2018. Details of Mr Wood’s package are set out 
in the Annual Report on Remuneration. 
IFRS 15 and 16
During the year, the Committee has also considered the implications of the new accounting standards IFRS 15 and IFRS 16 on our incentive 
plans. In summary, there will be no impact on the STIP, as 2017 targets and actual performance are measured on a consistent basis, prior 
to these standards being adopted by the Group on 1 January 2018. 2018 STIP targets and actual performance will both reflect the impact of 
these two new standards. For the LTIP, the situation is more complex because we measure certain targets over a three-year period but will 
only have audited numbers on both the old and new basis for 2017. As a result, the Committee plans to agree restated 2017 LTIP targets 
during 2018. The restated targets will be disclosed in the 2018 Directors’ remuneration report. The 2016 LTIP targets will not be restated – 
while the 2016 and 2017 out-turn will be available on the old basis, the 2018 new basis numbers will be restated to the old basis using as a 
guide transitional adjustments made in preparing the 2018 budget.
2017 Group performance
Revenue increased by 2%, benefitting from favourable currency movements offset by the impact of M&A in the year. Organic revenue 
growth of 2% included 4% growth in civil aerospace and 1% in military, partially offset by continued weakness in energy which reduced by 
8%. Underlying operating profit increased organically by 1%, with benefits from strategic initiatives including supply chain rationalisation, 
the Meggitt Production System and increased pricing leverage. This was partly offset by continued headwinds from mix, depreciation, 
amortisation and growth in new product introduction costs at Meggitt Polymers & Composites. Underlying EPS increased from 34.8p to 
35.3p.
The Committee has determined that the 2015 LTIP award will vest at 18.9% of maximum, reflecting that performance was below threshold 
for the three multi-year performance conditions relating to EPS, ROTA and organic revenue growth. However, performance against the 
annual strategic targets was just above target (see page 85). The 2017 STIP award financial measures have vested at above target for cash 
and above threshold for profit. Personal measures for the executive directors were met as detailed on page 84.
The Committee believes that our remuneration policy and approach to implementation remain aligned with our strategy and prevailing 
market practice. On behalf of the Board, I would like to thank shareholders for their continued support.

Directors’ remuneration report continued STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE
Annual Report and Accounts 2017 MEGGITT PLC 75
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS gO vernance OTHER INFORMATION
This Directors’ remuneration report has been prepared in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006 and Schedule 8 of 
the Large and Medium sized Companies and Groups (Accounts and Reports) (Amendment) Regulations 2013. The report also meets the 
requirements of the UK Listing Authority’s Listing Rules and the Disclosure Guidance and Transparency Rules (DTR). In this report we 
describe how the principles relating to directors’ remuneration, as set out in the UK Corporate Governance Code 2016 (the Code), are 
applied in practice.
The Policy report
This Policy was approved by shareholders at the AGM on 27 April 2017 and is effective for a period of three years from that date. 
 
Executive Director Remuneration Policy Table
Base salary
Function To attract and retain talent by ensuring base salaries are competitive in the relevant talent market.
Operation Salary will be reviewed by the Committee annually, in February, with changes effective from 1 April of that year.
Salaries for the year under review are disclosed in the annual report on remuneration.
In deciding salary levels, the Committee considers personal performance including how the individual has helped to support 
the strategic objectives of the Group. The Committee will also consider employment conditions and salary levels across 
the Group, prevailing market conditions, and market data for FTSE companies in similar industries and those with similar 
market capitalisation.
Salaries are paid to existing directors in GBP; however the Committee reserves the right to pay future and existing directors 
in any other currency (converted at the prevailing market rate when a change is agreed).
Opportunity The percentage salary increases for executive directors will not exceed those of the wider workforce over the life of this 
Policy in the normal course of business. Higher increases may be awarded (i.e. in excess of the wider employee population) 
in instances where, for example, there is a material change in the responsibility, size or complexity of the role, or if a new 
director was intentionally appointed on a below-market salary. The Committee will provide the rationale for any such higher 
increases in the relevant year’s annual report on remuneration.
Performance 
metrics
None explicitly, but salaries are independently benchmarked periodically against FTSE companies in similar industries 
and those with similar market capitalisation. Personal performance is also taken into account when considering salary 
increases.
Pension
Function To provide post-retirement benefits for executive directors in a cost-efficient manner.
Operation The pension plans operated by the Group which executive directors are, or could be, members of are:
• Meggitt Pension Plan (defined benefit pension plan, closed to new members).
• Meggitt Workplace Savings Plan (defined contribution personal pension scheme, open to new members).
Salary is the only element of remuneration that is pensionable. There are no unfunded pension promises or similar 
arrangements for directors.
Opportunity New executive director external appointments since 2013 are eligible for a pension allowance of 25% of salary, payable 
either as a pension contribution up to any limit set in current regulations or, above such limits, in cash. Where agreements 
have been made prior to the approval of the Policy approved by shareholders in 2014 (“2014 Policy”) which entitle an 
executive to receive a pension allowance higher than 25% of salary, pension allowances up to a maximum of 50% of salary 
will be paid. Mr Young and Mr Green had agreements prior to the approval of the 2014 Policy which entitle them to receive a 
pension allowance of 50% of salary and this arrangement will continue for these directors during the life of the Policy.

Benefits
Function To provide non-cash benefits which are competitive in the market in which the executive director is employed.
Operation The Group may provide benefits including, but not limited to, a company car or car allowance, private medical insurance, 
permanent health insurance, life assurance, a fuel allowance, a mobile phone, relocation costs and any other future benefits 
made available either to all employees globally or all employees in the region in which the executive director is employed.
Opportunity Benefits vary by role and individual circumstances; eligibility and cost is reviewed periodically. Benefits in respect of 
the year under review are disclosed in the annual report on remuneration. It is not anticipated that the costs of benefits 
provided will increase significantly in the financial years over which this Policy will apply, although the Committee retains 
discretion to approve a higher cost in exceptional circumstances (e.g. to facilitate recruitment, relocation, expatriation, 
etc.) or in circumstances where factors outside the Group’s control have changed materially (e.g. market increases in 
insurance costs).
Performance 
metrics
None.
Annual bonus (Short Term Incentive Plan – STIP)
Function To incentivise executive directors on delivering annual financial and personal targets. 
Operation Performance measures, targets and weightings are set at the start of the year.
The performance period of the STIP is a financial year. After the end of the financial year, to the extent that the performance 
criteria have been met, 75% of the STIP award is paid in cash to the director. The remaining 25% of the award will be 
deferred into shares and released (with no further performance conditions attached, and no matching shares provided) 
after a further period of two years.
Under the STIP 2014 rules as approved by the Committee, the Committee may decide to apply malus and/or clawback to 
STIP awards and deferred STIP awards to reduce the vesting of awards and/or require repayment of awards in the event 
of a review of the conduct, capability or performance of the director where there has been misconduct by the director or 
material misstatement of the Company’s or a Group member’s financial results for any period.
Deferred STIP awards may lapse in certain leaver circumstances.
Opportunity The STIP provides for a maximum award opportunity of up to 150% of salary in normal circumstances, with an on-target 
opportunity of 100% of salary and an opportunity of 50% of salary at threshold performance.
The Committee has discretion to make a STIP award of up to 200% of salary in exceptional circumstances (e.g. a 
substantial contract win which has a significant positive financial impact in the long term but which has no, or negative, 
short term financial impact).
Dividends accrue on unvested deferred STIP awards over the vesting period and are released on the vesting date.
Performance 
metrics
STIP awards are based on the achievement of financial and personal performance targets. For the executive directors, 
the STIP will be based on a combination of the financial performance of the Group and personal performance. The relative 
weightings of the financial and personal elements for any STIP period, and the measures used to assess financial and 
non-financial performance, will be set by the Committee in its absolute discretion to align with the Group’s operating 
and strategic priorities for that year. However, the weighting for personal performance will not exceed one-third of the 
maximum STIP opportunity in any year.
The award for performance under each element of the STIP will be calculated independently. The Committee has discretion 
to review the consistency of the pay-out of the financial and personal elements and adjust the total up or down (within the 
levels specified above) if it does not consider this to be a fair reflection of the underlying performance of the Group or the 
individual.
The personal performance element will typically be based on three to five objectives relevant to the executive’s 
role and performance in core competency areas, which are seven core skills specifically selected as critical for the 
Group’s employees.
Details of the measures, weightings and targets applicable to the STIP for each year, including a description of how they 
were chosen and whether they were met, will be disclosed retrospectively in the annual report on remuneration for the 
following year (subject to commercial sensitivity).

Long Term Incentive Plan (LTIP)
Function To align the interests of executive directors with shareholders in growing the value of the Group over the long term.
Operation Under the LTIP, executive directors are eligible to receive annual awards over Meggitt shares vesting after three years, 
subject to the achievement of stretching performance targets.
Whilst it is the current intention that LTIP awards will be in the form of nil cost options, the LTIP provides, at the absolute 
discretion of the Committee, for awards of conditional shares, market value share options and phantom awards.
Under the LTIP 2014 rules, the Committee may decide to apply malus and/or clawback to awards to reduce the vesting 
of awards and/or require repayment of awards in the event of a review of the conduct, capability or performance of the 
director where there has been misconduct by the director or material misstatement of the Company’s or a Group member’s 
financial results for any period.
LTIP awards made to executive directors from 2018 are subject to a two-year holding period after the three-year vesting 
period.
Opportunity Executive directors will normally be eligible for annual LTIP awards of 220% of salary. Awards up to a maximum of 300% 
of salary may be granted in exceptional circumstances (e.g. to support the recruitment of a key executive or to recognise 
exceptional individual performance).
30% of an award will vest if performance against each performance condition is at threshold and 100% if each is at 
maximum, with straight line vesting in between.
Dividends accrue on unvested LTIP awards over the vesting period and are released, to the extent the LTIP award vests, on 
the vesting/exercise date.
Performance 
metrics
Vesting of LTIP awards is subject to continued employment and performance against three measures, which are intended 
to be as follows for awards made over the life of the Policy:
• Earnings per Share (EPS);
• Return on Capital Employed (ROCE); and
• Strategic goals (typically but not always to be based on strategic priorities around execution, growth and innovation), 
which will be explained in the relevant annual report on remuneration.
The way these measures link to our KPIs can be seen on pages 30 to 33. It is the intention that the weighting of the 
measures will be equal (i.e. one-third each) but that the Committee will consider, and adjust if deemed appropriate, the 
weighting at the start of each LTIP cycle.
Awards made under the LTIP have a performance period of three financial years, starting from 1 January of the year in 
which the award is made and ending on 31 December of the third year. If no entitlement has been earned at the end of the 
relevant performance period, awards will lapse.
Vesting of the strategic element will also be subject to a discretionary assessment by the Committee of the extent to which 
achievement of the strategic objectives is consistent with the underlying financial performance over the three-year period.
The measures and targets in operation for grants made under the LTIP, and which are not deemed commercially sensitive, 
are disclosed in the annual report on remuneration for the relevant year of grant. Any commercially sensitive information on 
measures, targets and performance will be disclosed retrospectively.
Sharesave Scheme and Share Incentive Plan (SIP)
Function To align the interests of employees and shareholders by encouraging all employees to own Meggitt shares.
Operation Sharesave Scheme—All employee scheme under which all UK employees (including UK executive directors) may save up to 
a maximum monthly savings limit over a period of three or five years. Options under the Sharesave Scheme are granted at a 
discount of up to 20% to the market value of shares at the date of grant.
SIP—All employee scheme under which (i) all UK employees (including UK executive directors) may contribute up to 
a monthly maximum to purchase shares monthly from pre-tax pay; and (ii) all UK employees (including UK executive 
directors) may receive free shares up to an annual maximum value.
Opportunity Savings, contributions and free shares are capped at or below the legislative maximum for tax-qualifying approved share 
plans at the time UK employees are invited to participate.

Notes to the Policy table
The Committee is satisfied that the above Policy is in the best interests of shareholders and does not promote excessive risk-taking. The 
Committee retains discretion to make minor, non-significant changes to the Policy without reverting to shareholders.
Payments from outstanding awards
Outstanding awards are currently held by the directors under the Equity Participation Plan and the Executive Share Option Scheme which 
were the Group’s long term incentive plans prior to the introduction of the LTIP in 2014. These awards have all vested in accordance with 
the applicable performance conditions and are capable of exercise during the period over which this Policy applies. The tables on pages 92 
to 93 highlight outstanding and vested awards.
Approach to target setting and performance measure selection
Performance measures have been selected to closely align with, and reinforce, Meggitt’s strategic priorities (see page 12). Targets applying 
to the STIP and LTIP are reviewed annually, based on a number of internal and external reference points, including the Group’s strategic 
plan, analyst forecasts for Meggitt and its sector comparators, historical growth achieved by Meggitt and its sector comparators, market 
practice and external expectations for growth in Meggitt’s markets.
STIP
The performance measures used in the STIP reflect financial targets for the year and non-financial performance objectives. The Policy 
provides the Committee with flexibility to select appropriate measures on an annual basis.
STIP performance targets are set to be stretching but achievable, with regard to the particular personal performance objectives and the 
economic environment in a given year. For financial measures, ‘target’ is based around the annual budget approved by the Board. Prior 
to the start of the financial year, the Committee sets an appropriate performance range around target, which it considers provides an 
appropriate degree of ‘stretch’ challenge and an incentive to outperform.
LTIP
The vesting of LTIP awards made during the life of this Policy will be linked to EPS, ROCE and the achievement of long-term strategic goals.
EPS is considered by the Board to be the most important measure of Meggitt’s financial performance. It is highly visible internally, is 
regularly monitored and reported and is strongly motivational for participants. EPS targets will continue to be set on a nominal cumulative 
(pence) basis to incentivise consistent performance and reflect the fact that Meggitt’s profits are generated to a large degree outside the 
UK and not significantly influenced by UK retail price inflation.
ROCE helps to balance the achievement of growth and returns. The Committee believes ROCE is a good proxy for total shareholder return 
(TSR) which focuses executives on managing the balance sheet and Meggitt’s operational performance. For executive directors, the use of 
ROCE targets reflects the fact that acquisition decisions come within the collective responsibility of the Board.
The Committee believes that the strategic goals component helps reinforce the realisation of the Group’s strategy and the achievement of 
key non-financial and strategic goals over long product cycles which drive long-term value at Meggitt. This element will typically comprise a 
scorecard of three-year targets across a maximum of three core strategic areas for the Group. The Committee believes that this approach 
enables it to reflect the Group’s long-term nature and shifting strategic priorities in the LTIP to ensure executives’ interests remain closely 
aligned with those of our shareholders over time. Specific measures and targets for each area will be developed and clearly defined at the 
start of each three-year cycle to balance leading and lagging indicators of performance. Vesting of this element is subject to a discretionary 
assessment by the Committee of the extent to which achievement of the strategic objectives is consistent with Meggitt’s underlying 
financial performance over the performance period.
Remuneration policy for other employees
The remuneration policy for other employees is based on broadly consistent principles as that for executive directors. Annual salary 
reviews take into account personal performance, Group performance, local pay and market conditions, and salary levels for similar roles 
in comparable companies. Some employees below executive level are eligible to participate in annual bonus schemes; opportunities and 
performance measures vary by organisational level, geographical region and an individual’s role. Senior executives are eligible for LTIP 
awards on similar terms to the executive directors (except some of the performance conditions may vary), although award opportunities 
are lower and vary by organisational level. All UK employees are eligible to participate in the Sharesave Scheme and SIP on identical terms.
Share ownership guidelines
The minimum shareholding guideline for executive directors is 300% of base salary for the Chief Executive and 200% of base salary for 
each of the other executive directors. There is no set time frame within which executive directors have to meet the guideline, however until 
they meet the guideline they are not permitted to sell more than 50% of the after-tax value of a vested share award. The shareholding 
requirement ceases when a director leaves the Group. Further information on the shareholding requirement is in the annual report on 
remuneration on page 91.

Non-executive directors – Remuneration Policy table
Non-executive directors stand for re-election annually, do not have a contract of service and are not eligible to join the Group’s pension or 
share schemes. Details of the Policy on fees paid to our non-executive directors are set out in the table below:
Fees
Function To attract and retain non-executive directors of the highest calibre with broad commercial and other experience relevant to 
the Group.
Operation Fee levels are reviewed annually, with any adjustments effective 1 April each year. The fees paid to the Chairman of the 
Board are determined by the Committee, while the fees for all other non-executive directors are reviewed by a committee 
of the Board formed of the executive directors. Fees for the year under review and for the current year are disclosed in the 
annual report on remuneration on page 84.
Additional fees are paid to the chairmen of the Remuneration and Audit Committee and to the Senior Independent Director, 
to reflect the additional time commitment of these roles. Additional fees may also be paid to non-executive directors to 
cover the cost of attendance at meetings which take place outside their continent of residence. In addition, non-executive 
directors are reimbursed for reasonable business-related expenses.
In deciding fee increases, the committees consider employment conditions and salary increases across the Group and 
prevailing market conditions.
Currently, all fees are paid in GBP, however the Committee reserves the right to pay future and existing non-executive 
directors in any other currency (converted at the prevailing market rate when a change is agreed).
Opportunity Fee increases will be applied taking into account the outcome of the annual review. The maximum aggregate annual fee for 
all non-executive directors (including the Chairman) as provided in the Company’s Articles of Association is £1,000,000.

Recruitment
External appointments
In cases of hiring or appointing a new executive director from outside the Group, the Committee may make use of all existing components 
of remuneration, as follows:
Component Approach
Maximum annual
grant value
Base salary The base salaries of new appointees will be determined based on the experience and skills 
of the individual, internal comparisons, employment conditions and salary levels across the 
Group, and prevailing market conditions. Initial salaries may be set below market conditions 
and consideration given to phasing any increases over two or three years subject to 
development in the role.
N/A
Pension In line with the Policy, new appointees will be entitled to become members of the Meggitt 
Workplace Savings Plan (defined contribution plan) or receive a cash pension allowance of 25% 
of salary in lieu.
N/A
Benefits/
Sharesave/SIP
New appointees will be eligible to receive benefits in line with the Policy but only UK employees 
will be eligible to participate in all-employee share schemes.
N/A
STIP The structure described in the Policy table will apply to new appointees with the relevant 
maximum being pro-rated to reflect the proportion of the year worked. Targets for the personal 
element will be tailored to the appointee.
150% of salary
(200% in exceptional 
circumstances)
LTIP New appointees will be granted awards under the LTIP on similar terms as other executive 
directors, as described in the Policy table.
220% of salary 
(300% in exceptional 
circumstances)
In determining the appropriate remuneration structure and levels, the Committee will take into consideration all relevant factors to ensure 
that arrangements are in the best interests of Meggitt and its shareholders. The Committee may make an award in respect of a new 
appointment to ‘buy out’ incentive arrangements forfeited on leaving a previous employer, i.e. over and above the approach outlined in 
the table above. Any such compensatory awards will be made under existing share schemes, where appropriate, and will be subject to the 
normal rules and performance conditions of those schemes.
The Committee may also consider it appropriate to structure ‘buy-out’ awards differently to the structure described in the Policy table, 
exercising the discretion available under UKLA Listing Rule 9.4.2 R where necessary to make a one-off award to an executive director in the 
context of recruitment. In doing so, the Committee will consider relevant factors including any performance conditions attached to these 
awards, the likelihood of those conditions being met and the proportion of the vesting period remaining. The value of any such ‘buy-out’ will 
be fully disclosed.
Internal promotion
Where a new executive director is appointed by way of internal promotion the Policy will be consistent with that for external appointees as 
detailed above. Any commitments made prior to an individual’s promotion will continue to be honoured even if they would not otherwise 
be consistent with the Policy prevailing when the commitment is fulfilled although the Group may, where appropriate, seek to revise an 
individual’s existing service contract on promotion to ensure it aligns with other executive directors and prevailing market best practice.
Disclosure on the remuneration structure of any new executive director, including details of any exceptional payments, will be disclosed 
either in the RIS notification made at the time of appointment or in the annual report on remuneration for the year in which the recruitment 
occurred.
Non-executive directors
In recruiting a new non-executive director the Committee will use the Policy as set out in the table on page 79.
Directors’ remuneration report continued STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE
Annual Report and Accounts 2017 MEGGITT PLC 81
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS gO vernance OTHER INFORMATION
Discretion
The Committee will operate the Group’s incentive plans according to their respective rules and the Policy set out above, and in accordance 
with the Listing Rules and HMRC rules, where relevant. In line with common market practice, the Committee retains discretion as to the 
operation and administration of these incentive plans, including with respect to:
• Who participates;
• The timing of grant and/or payment;
• The size of an award and/or payment;
• The manner in which awards are settled;
• The choice of (and adjustment of) performance measures and targets in accordance with the Policy set out above and the rules of each 
plan;
• The measurement of performance in the event of a variation of share capital, change of control, special dividend, distribution or any 
other corporate event which may affect the current or future value of an award;
• Determination of a ‘good leaver’ (in addition to any specified categories) for incentive plan purposes, based on the rules of each plan and 
the circumstances of the individual leaving; and
• Adjustments required in certain circumstances (e.g. rights issues, share buybacks, special dividends, other corporate events, etc.).
Any use of the above discretion in relation to the executive directors would, where relevant, be explained in the annual report on 
remuneration for the year in which the discretion was exercised. As appropriate, it might also be the subject of consultation with the 
Group’s major shareholders.
Minor changes
The Committee may make minor amendments to the rules of the Group’s incentive plans (for regulatory, exchange control, tax or 
administrative purposes or to take account of a change in legislation) without requiring prior shareholder approval for that amendment.
Service contracts and exit payment policy
Executive director service contracts, including arrangements for early termination, are carefully considered by the Committee and are 
designed to recruit, retain and motivate directors of the quality required to manage the Group.
The Committee’s policy is that executive directors’ service contracts should be terminable on no more than 12 months’ notice.
The Committee’s approach to payments in the event of termination of employment of an executive director is to take account of the 
particular circumstances, including the reasons for termination, individual performance, contractual obligations and the rules of the 
Group’s applicable incentive plans which apply to awards held by the executive directors:
• Compensation for loss of office in service contracts
 Except as set out in the table on page 82, under the terms of their service contracts, the executive directors may be required to work 
during their notice period or may, if the Group decides, be paid in lieu of notice if not required to work the full notice period. Payment 
in lieu of notice will be equal to base salary plus the cost to the Group of providing the contractual benefits (pensions allowance, health 
insurance and company car or car allowance) that would otherwise have been paid or provided during the notice period. Payments 
will be in equal monthly instalments and will be subject to mitigation such that payments will either reduce, or stop completely, if the 
executive director obtains alternative employment. An executive director’s employment can be terminated by the Group without notice 
or payment in lieu of notice in specific circumstances including summary dismissal, bankruptcy or resignation.
• Treatment of STIP
 Executive directors have no automatic entitlement to any bonus on termination of employment under the STIP, but the Committee 
may use its discretion to award a bonus (normally pro-rated). Where any bonus is deferred into shares the award will normally lapse if 
an executive director’s employment terminates unless the executive director leaves for specified reasons. The ‘good leaver’ reasons 
are death, redundancy, retirement, injury, disability, the business or company which employs the executive director ceasing to be part 
of the Group or any other circumstances in which the Committee exercises discretion to treat the executive director as a ‘good leaver’. 
If the executive director is a ‘good leaver’ their award will vest on the normal vesting date and will not be subject to pro-rating. Awards 
normally vest early on a change of control of the Company.
• Treatment of long term incentive plan awards
 The treatment of awards under the ESOS, EPP and LTIP is governed by the rules of the plans which have been approved by shareholders 
and is described below. Awards will normally lapse if an executive director’s employment terminates unless the executive director 
leaves for specified ‘good leaver’ reasons. The ‘good leaver’ reasons are the same as described above. If the executive director is a ‘good 
leaver’, awards will vest to the extent that the attached performance conditions are met, but on a time pro-rated basis, with Committee 
discretion to allow early vesting. Under the LTIP, awards vest on the normal vesting date subject to performance over the normal 
performance period, unless the Committee decides otherwise. Awards normally vest early on a change of control of the Company 
subject to performance conditions and time pro-rating. 82 MEGGITT PLC

that are required to be made under Mr Green’s service 
contract are not required to be consistent with the Policy.
Payments to Mr Green under his service contract differ 
from the Policy in the following respects:
On termination of employment, Mr Green is entitled to a 
liquidated damages payment equal to his salary and the 
value of his contractual benefits (bonus, pension allowance, 
insurance and company car or car allowance) at the date 
of termination, pro-rated to the remaining notice period 
less an amount equal to 5% of the aggregate sum and the 
Committee shall exercise its discretion under the Group’s 
share plans to treat Mr Green as a ‘good leaver’.
On change of control, Mr Green may give notice to 
terminate his employment within six months of the event 
and upon such termination he shall become entitled to the 
liquidated damages payment summarised above.
External appointments held by executive directors
The Board believes that the Group can benefit from experience gained when executive directors hold external non-executive directorships. 
Executive directors are allowed to hold external appointments and to receive payment provided such appointments are agreed by the 
Board or Committee in advance, there are no conflicts of interests and the appointment does not lead to deterioration in the individual’s 
performance. Details of external appointments and the associated fees received are included in the annual report on remuneration on  
page 91.
Consideration of conditions elsewhere in the Group
The Committee does not consult with employees specifically on executive remuneration policy and framework but the Committee does 
review salary data from across the Group. The Committee seeks to promote and maintain good relations with employee representative 
bodies, including trade unions and works councils, as part of its broader employee engagement strategy and consults on matters affecting 
employees and business performance as required in each case by law and regulation in the jurisdictions in which the Group operates. 
Salary increases made elsewhere in the Group are amongst the data that the Committee considers in determining salaries for executive 
directors.
In making remuneration decisions for the executive directors the Committee considers the pay and employment conditions elsewhere 
in the Group. To assist in this, the Committee members receive updates from the executives on pay decisions throughout the Group, 
including STIP payments and share awards made to executives outside the Committee’s remit.
Consideration of shareholder views
The Committee Chairman is available to discuss remuneration matters with the Group’s major shareholders and is also regularly updated 
on feedback on remuneration received by the Chairman of the Board and executive directors directly from shareholders. The Committee 
Chairman ensures the Committee is kept informed of shareholder views. The Committee Chairman consulted with shareholders, reviewed 
their guidelines and guidelines released by other shareholder representative bodies, before the Policy was put to shareholders for approval 
at the 2017 AGM.

2 Taxable benefits consist primarily of company car or car allowance, fuel allowance and private health care insurance. For 2017, this included limited relocation expenses 
for Mr A Wood payable under his service contract until 31 December 2018.
3 STIP paid for performance over the relevant financial year. Further details of the 2017 STIP, including performance measures, actual performance and bonus payouts, 
can be found on pages 84 to 85.
4 LTIP is calculated as the number of shares vesting based on certain performance measures and valued at the market value of the shares on the vesting date. For 2017, 
the figure represents the actual vesting outcome of the 2015 award, for which the performance measures were based on EPS, ROTA and strategic measures. Based 
on performance to 31 December 2017, the 2015 LTIP award will vest at 18.9%. The market value of vested shares has been estimated using the average share price 
over the last quarter of 2017 of 499.08p. This value will be trued up in next year’s report to reflect the share price on the vesting date. For 2016, the figure represents 
the actual vesting of the 2014 award which has been trued up, compared to that reported last year, to reflect the actual share price on the date of vesting (482.10p). 
Further details on performance criteria, achievement and resulting vesting levels can be found on pages 85 to 86. The figures include the accrued distribution payable 
on the shares that vest (equivalent to a dividend paid as income). 84 MEGGITT PLC

Chief Executive retirement 
Mr S G Young retired from the Board on 31 December 2017 (and will retire as an employee on 30 April 2018). As a retiree, the Committee 
confirmed Mr Young would be a good leaver under the executive and UK employee share plans from 30 April 2018, and so all awards vest 
at the appropriate time, subject to the normal pro-rating and other scheme rules. Mr Young’s 2017 STIP will be subject to the normal 25% 
deferral for a period of two years alongside the other executive directors. There are no other terms associated with his retirement to note.

The Board set stretching financial and strategic targets for the STIP at the start of the 2017 financial year. These targets, and our 
performance against these, are summarised in the table below.

1 Measured at constant currency.
2 Individual personal performance is measured on a scale of 1 to 5. There is also a weighting applied to the outcome of performance against seven core competencies 
which are specific characteristics and behaviours in how executive directors performed their work and accomplished their goals (collaboration, driving results, ensuring 
accountability, being resilient, situational adaptability, customer focus and decision quality). The average of all ratings drives the STIP outcome, where 2 indicates 
expectations are partially met, 3 is fully met and 4 exceeds expectations.
In determining the outcome of the 2017 STIP, the Committee considered the impact of Dassault’s cancellation of the Falcon 5X 
programme, which was announced in December 2017. As reported in the Chief Financial Officer’s review on page 35, the Group has taken a 
£59.5m exceptional impairment charge related to this cancellation. The Committee has determined that no adjustment should be made for 
this charge in calculating the STIP payments (which are based on underlying profit before exceptional items). The Committee considered 
the following factors: (i) the programme was cancelled by the customer, not the Group; (ii) the aerospace industry business model involves 
suppliers taking the risk for changes in market dynamics affecting programmes and ultimately for any failure for a platform to enter 
service, but the history of programme cancellations such as this is extremely rare; (iii) the programme was originally bid in 2008 and won 
in 2010 and there is no suggestion that this was in any way an inappropriate commercial decision at the time, neither did any prior STIP 
payment receive any financial credit from this programme; and (iv) the Group is actively seeking ways to mitigate the financial impact of 
the cancellation, however the financial benefit of any mitigation will not be applied to STIP payments in the future. 
In terms of personal performance conditions, the following is a summary of the conditions which applied in 2017 to each executive director:
Mr S G Young: improve investor confidence; review, update and implement portfolio strategy actions to reduce debt and sharpen focus; 
develop and embed Group vision with senior leaders; conduct operating review and determine operating strategy and targets to 2021 and 
agree Chief Operating Officer development plan.

2 Performance score out of 5. MPS vesting is based on the number of our sites that have progressed up one stage of MPS in the year, against stretching targets set for 
overall progression. Innovation vesting is determined based on progress with certain important innovation projects against detailed milestone criteria, as assessed by 
our Chief Technology Officer. Quality and delivery is based on progress against specific targets in each of these areas. For each of these measures the vesting criteria 
were set at the start of the year and assessed at the end of the year. Programme management vesting is an assessment of programme performance and is based on

The table below shows the percentage change in CEO remuneration from the prior year compared to the average percentage change
in remuneration for all executive employees. We have selected our senior executive population for this comparison because it is considered 
to be the most relevant, due to the structure of total remuneration; most of our senior executives receive benefits under the same STIP and

1 The base salary for the Chief Executive is based on data for Mr Young in 2016 and 2017. Base salary for Mr Wood as Chief Executive is disclosed in the note below 
on page 88. Base salary data for executive employees is calculated using the increase in the earnings of around 220 full-time executive employees using the same 
employee data set in 2016 and 2017. Around 41% of executives received a pay rise of 2.5% or less. Around 41% received pay rises of between 2.5% and 5%. A further 
18% received pay rises above 5% largely owing to changes in responsibilities.
2 For benefits, this information is not collected for the executive employee population and is therefore estimated from a sample of executive employees, using a 
consistent set of employees.
3 The STIP for executive employees is calculated using the increase in the STIP payout to around 220 full-time executive employees using the same employee data set in

Review of past performance
The remuneration package is structured to help ensure alignment with shareholders. There is no direct correlation between share price 
movement and the change in the value of the pay package in any one year (as the remuneration package comprises several components, 
some fixed, and others based on non-financial measures). The graph and table below show how the CEO’s pay has correlated to total 
shareholder return over the last nine years.
This graph illustrates the Group’s performance compared to the FTSE 100 Index, which is considered the most appropriate broad equity 
market index against which the Group’s performance should be measured. Performance, as required by legislation, is measured by TSR 
over the nine-year period from 1 January 2009 to 31 December 2017:

Implementation of Remuneration Policy for 2018
Base salary, pension and benefits
Base salaries are reviewed taking into account personal performance, employment conditions and salary levels across the Group and 
prevailing market conditions. Base salaries were reviewed in early 2018. The base salary for Mr Wood was changed on 1 January 2018 to 
reflect his new responsibilities as Chief Executive (see page 73 for details) and will not be further increased on 1 April. The base salaries 
for the other executive directors will be increased by 1.99% from 1 April 2018. In agreeing these increases the Committee took into 
account average expected salary increases across the general workforce, industry benchmarks and broader retail inflation, as well as the 
performance of the executive directors in 2017. The salary adjustments for the executive directors are lower than or equal to the expected 
increase across the general workforce.

 • 1.0 – threshold objective not met
 • 2.0 – threshold met
 • 3.0 – on target
 • 4.0 – stretch objective met
 • 5.0 – stretch objective exceeded
2 The targets apply to year 1 of the 2018 LTIP award, year 2 of the 2017 LTIP award and year 3 of the 2016 LTIP award.
3 Inventory is measured at constant currency, gross of provisions, averaging month end balances over a year.
The Committee has discussed the potential impact of IFRS 15 on the outcome of the underlying EPS measure, where strong performance 
and growth on programmes with significant Free of Charge content would lead to reduced underlying EPS in the near term and reduced 
LTIP vesting. The Committee does not wish to disincentivise strong performance in this area as it is an important driver of longer term 
growth and will take this into account when considering the vesting outcome of the EPS measure under LTIP.

During 2017 the Company made the DRIP available to shareholders

shareholders in 2018 and the date by which relevant DRIP elections

Company’s auditors.
Conflicts of interest
The Company has a procedure for the disclosure, review,
authorisation and management of directors’ conflicts of interest 
and potential conflicts of interest, in accordance with
the provisions of the Companies Act 2006. In deciding whether to

regard to their general duties under the Companies Act 2006. The 
authorisation of any conflict matter and the terms of authorisation 
are regularly reviewed by the Board.
Political donations
The Company and the Group did not make any political donations

The ordinary shares are listed on the London Stock Exchange. 
The rights and obligations attaching to the Company’s ordinary 
shares are set out in the Articles. A copy of the Articles is available 
for inspection at the Company’s registered office. The holders of 
ordinary shares are entitled to receive the Company’s report and 
accounts, to attend and speak at general meetings of the Company, 
to appoint proxies to exercise full voting rights and to participate in

ordinary shares and no requirements for prior approval of any 
transfers. There are no known arrangements under which financial 
rights are held by persons other than holders of the shares and no

passu (on an equal footing) with the shares in issue and have no 
special rights.
Rules about the appointment and replacement of directors are 
contained in the Articles which provide that a director may be 
appointed by ordinary resolution of the shareholders or by the 
existing directors, either to fill a vacancy or as an additional director. 
Changes to the Articles must be submitted to the shareholders for 
approval by way of special resolution. The directors may exercise 
all the powers of the Company subject to the provisions of relevant 
legislation, the Articles and any directions given by the Company in 
general meeting.
At the 2017 AGM, the Company was granted authority by 
shareholders to purchase up to 77,571,916 ordinary shares, being 
10% of the Company’s issued share capital, in accordance with the 
Articles. No shares were bought back under this authority during 
the year ended 31 December 2017. Shares purchased under this 
authority would be cancelled or held as treasury shares to be sold 
at a later date or used to satisfy awards under the Company’s share

Statement of directors’ responsibilities
The directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report and 
the financial statements in accordance with applicable law and 
regulation.
Company law requires the directors to prepare financial statements 
for each financial year. Under that law the directors have prepared 
the Group financial statements in accordance with International 
Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European 
Union and Company financial statements in accordance with United 
Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice (United Kingdom 
Accounting Standards, comprising FRS 101 “Reduced Disclosure 
Framework”, and applicable law). Under Company law the directors 
must not approve the financial statements unless they are satisfied 
that they give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Group 
and Company and of the profit or loss of the Group and Company 
for that period. In preparing the financial statements, the directors 
are required to:
• select suitable accounting policies and then apply them 
consistently;
• state whether applicable IFRSs as adopted by the European 
Union have been followed for the Group financial statements 
and United Kingdom Accounting Standards, comprising FRS 
101, have been followed for the Company financial statements, 
subject to any material departures disclosed and explained in 
the financial statements;
• make judgements and accounting estimates that are reasonable 
and prudent; and
• prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis 
unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Group and 
Company will continue in business.

Opinion
In our opinion:
• Meggitt PLC’s Group financial statements and Company 
financial statements (the “financial statements”) give a true and 
fair view of the state of the Group’s and of the Company’s affairs 
as at 31 December 2017 and of the Group’s profit and cash flows 
for the year then ended;
• the Group financial statements have been properly prepared in 
accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union;
• the Company financial statements have been properly prepared 
in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted 
Accounting Practice (United Kingdom Accounting Standards, 
comprising FRS 101 “Reduced Disclosure Framework”, and 
applicable law); and
• the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with 
the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 and, as regards 
the Group financial statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation.
We have audited the financial statements, included within the 
Annual Report and Accounts 2017 (the “Annual Report”), which 
comprise: the Consolidated and Company balance sheets as 
at 31 December 2017; the Consolidated income statement 
and Consolidated statement of comprehensive income; the 
Consolidated cash flow statement; and the Consolidated and 
Company statements of changes in equity for the year then 
ended; and the notes to the financial statements, which include a 
description of the significant accounting policies.
Our opinion is consistent with our reporting to the Audit Committee.
Basis for opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International 
Standards on Auditing (UK) (“ISAs (UK)”) and applicable law. 
Our responsibilities under ISAs (UK) are further described in the 
Auditors’ responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements 
section of our report. We believe that the audit evidence we have 
obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our 
opinion.
Independence
We remained independent of the Group in accordance with the 
ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the financial 
statements in the UK, which includes the FRC’s Ethical Standard, 
as applicable to listed public interest entities, and we have 
fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these 
requirements.
To the best of our knowledge and belief, we declare that non-audit 
services prohibited by the FRC’s Ethical Standard were not provided 
to the Group or the Company.
Other than those disclosed in the Audit Committee report, we have 
provided no non-audit services to the Group or the Company in the 
period from 1 January 2017 to 31 December 2017.

Materiality
 
• Overall Group materiality: £17.0m 
(2016: £17.0m), based on 5% of 
underlying profit before tax.
• Overall Company materiality: 
£35.0m (2016: £31.0m), based on 
1% of total assets.
• We identified 11 reporting units 
which, in our view, required a full 
scope audit based on their size 
or risk. In addition we determined 
that specified audit procedures 
were required at a further 6 
reporting units to address specific 
risk characteristics or to provide 
sufficient overall Group coverage 
of particular financial statement 
line items.
• We used component teams 
in 4 countries to perform a 
combination of full scope audits 
and specified procedures at 11 
reporting units, with the Group 
team performing the remainder.
• The Group consolidation, 
financial statement disclosures 
and a number of complex items, 
prepared by the head office 
finance function, were audited by 
the Group engagement team.
• Reporting units where we 
performed audit procedures 
accounted for 61% of Group 
profit before tax; 61% of Group 
underlying profit before tax; and 
82% of Group total assets. Our 
audit scope provided sufficient

The scope of our audit
As part of designing our audit, we determined materiality and 
assessed the risks of material misstatement in the financial 
statements. In particular, we looked at where the directors made 
subjective judgements, for example in respect of significant 
accounting estimates that involved making assumptions and 
considering future events that are inherently uncertain. 
We gained an understanding of the legal and regulatory framework 
applicable to the Group and the industries in which it operates, 
and considered the risk of acts by the Group which were contrary 
to applicable laws and regulations, including fraud. We designed 
audit procedures at Group and significant component level to 
respond to the risk, recognising that the risk of not detecting 
a material misstatement due to fraud is higher than the risk of 
not detecting one resulting from error, as fraud may involve 
deliberate concealment by, for example, forgery or intentional 
misrepresentations, or through collusion. We focused on laws and 
regulations that could give rise to a material misstatement in the 
Group and Company financial statements, including, but not limited 
to, Companies Act 2006, the Listing Rules, Pensions legislation, UK 
tax legislation and equivalent local laws and regulations applicable 
to significant component teams. Our tests included, but were 
not limited to, review of the financial statement disclosures to 
underlying supporting documentation, review of correspondence 
with legal advisors, enquiries of management, review of significant 
components auditors’ work and review of internal audit reports 
in so far as they related to the financial statements. There are 
inherent limitations in the audit procedures described above and 
the further removed non-compliance with laws and regulations 
is from the events and transactions reflected in the financial 
statements, the less likely we would become aware of it.
We did not identify any key audit matters relating to irregularities, 
including fraud. As in all of our audits we also addressed the risk 
of management override of internal controls, including testing 
journals and evaluating whether there was evidence of bias by the 
directors that represented a risk of material misstatement due to 
fraud. 
Key audit matters
Key audit matters are those matters that, in the auditors’ 
professional judgement, were of most significance in the audit of 
the financial statements of the current period and include the most 
significant assessed risks of material misstatement (whether or not 
due to fraud) identified by the auditors, including those which had 
the greatest effect on: the overall audit strategy; the allocation of 
resources in the audit; and directing the efforts of the engagement 
team. These matters, and any comments we make on the results 
of our procedures thereon, were addressed in the context of our 
audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming our 
opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these 
matters. This is not a complete list of all risks identified by our audit.  100 MEGGITT PLC
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Goodwill impairment assessments
Refer also to note 18 of the consolidated financial 
statements (pages 131 to 132).
The Group holds significant amounts of goodwill 
(£1,947.0m) on the balance sheet which is supported by 
an annual impairment review. No impairment charge has 
been recorded against goodwill in the current year.
Our audit focused on the risk that the carrying value of 
goodwill could be overstated.
Certain assumptions used in the impairment review are 
subjective and require estimates to be made to calculate 
the recoverable amount, determined by value in use, of 
cash generating units (“CGUs”) or groups of CGUs. The 
key estimates and assumptions assessed include:
• The future cash flow growth assumptions used in the 
Group’s most recent budgets and plans for the next 
five years approved by management (the “plan”);
• The growth rate used beyond the period covered by 
the plan; and 
• the discount rate applied to future cash flows.
We applied the following scoping criteria to identify 
those CGUs or groups of CGUs requiring additional audit 
procedures:
• CGUs or groups of CGUs that indicated a shortfall 
in value in use compared to total CGU or groups of 
CGUs carrying value when, for the period covered 
by the plan, the level of underlying profit growth was 
capped at a weighted average market growth rate, 
using economic and industry forecasts. The weighted 
average market growth rates were derived as follows:
 – For CGUs operating predominantly in the civil 
aerospace market, the civil aerospace capacity 
long-term trend rate measured in available seat 
kilometres (ASKs); and
 – For CGUs operating predominantly in the military, 
energy and other markets, territory Gross 
Domestic Product (“GDP”) growth projections, 
based on published economic projections.
This identified the following CGUs or groups of CGUs for 
further consideration:
• EDAC and Advanced Composites. This CGU has 
goodwill of £226.7m; and
• One CGU within “Other”. This CGU has goodwill of 
£15.9m. 
We evaluated the directors’ future cash flow forecasts and the process 
by which they were drawn up, and tested the integrity of the underlying 
discounted cash flow model. We compared the forecasts used in this model 
to the plan and assessed the actual performance in the year against the prior 
year budgets to evaluate historical forecasting accuracy.
In respect of the CGUs on which we focused our additional audit procedures 
on, we assessed the directors’ assumptions for future cash flow growth in the 
plan, by:
• Obtaining corroborating evidence to support growth assumptions in excess 
of our assumed weighted average market growth rate. We found that the 
assumptions used by the directors’ were supported by the evidence we 
obtained; and
• Performing sensitivity analysis in respect of the key assumptions to 
ascertain the extent of change in those assumptions which, either 
individually or collectively, would be required for the goodwill to be 
impaired. We noted that it would require significant downside changes 
before a material impairment would be required and having assessed the 
likelihood of these changes in assumptions arising we concluded that these 
were not considered to be reasonably possible.
For all impairment assessments we:
• Tested the discount rates, by comparing key inputs, where relevant, to 
externally derived data or data for comparable listed organisations. We 
engaged our specialists in assessing the overall discount rates used, and 
observed these to be within our expected range;
• Considered the use of the long-term GDP growth rates for the countries 
in which the CGU operates and observed these to be within our expected 
range; and
• Assessed the Group’s disclosures regarding the extent to which key 
assumptions would need to change for the recoverable amount to fall 
below the carrying value of goodwill, in particular in relation to those CGUs 
or group of CGUs with the lowest percentage headroom. We determined 
that these disclosures appropriately draw attention to the significant areas 
of estimate and judgement.

Development costs and programme participation 
costs impairment assessments
Refer also to note 19 of the consolidated financial 
statements (page 133).
The Group holds significant amounts of development 
costs (£482.3m) and programme participation costs 
(£332.1m) on the balance sheet. These intangible assets 
are subject to impairment testing at the individual 
asset (“programme”) level, at least annually and, where 
the programme value in use headroom compared to 
its carrying value is limited, or if events or changes in 
circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be 
recoverable, more frequently. An impairment charge 
of £56.8m has been recorded against these balances 
in the current year. This includes £55.9m which has 
been charged to exceptional operating items following 
Dassault Aviation’s (“Dassault”) announcement in 
December 2017 cancelling the Dassault Falcon 5X 
(“Falcon 5X”) programme. 
Our audit focused on the risk that the carrying value of 
these intangible assets could be overstated. Specifically 
in respect of the Falcon 5X programme we considered 
whether it was appropriate to impair the capitalised 
development costs and programme participation costs 
in full.
We focused our audit procedures on those programmes 
against which the directors have recorded an impairment 
provision, those with limited excess of value in use over 
carrying value and those with a significant carrying value.
The key estimates and assumptions assessed were:
• The estimated aircraft or engine volumes (“fleet 
forecasts”) and the period over which future cash 
flows are forecast (“fleet lives”);
• The sales price per part; and
• The discount rate applied to future cash flows.
We evaluated the directors’ future cash flow forecasts and the process 
by which they were drawn up, and tested the integrity of the underlying 
discounted cash flow model. In respect of the programme impairment 
assessments tested we:
• Agreed the fleet forecast data up to 2032 used in calculating the 
programme forecast cash flow to third party fleet forecast data, taking 
into account the extent to which the Group has a sole-source position. 
We corroborated any significant deviations applied by the directors to 
supporting evidence. We assessed fleet forecasts used beyond the period 
covered by the external market forecasts, considering average aircraft lives 
and trend analysis and considered them to be supported by the evidence 
we obtained;
• Agreed the sales price per part to customer contracts and did not identify 
any material exceptions in these tests;
• Tested the discount rates, by comparing key inputs, where relevant, to 
externally derived data or data for comparable listed organisations. We 
used our specialists in assessing the overall discount rates used, and 
observed them to be within our expected range; and
• Assessed the Group’s disclosures regarding the extent to which key 
assumptions would need to change for the recoverable amount to fall 
below the programme carrying values, in particular in relation to those 
with a significant carrying value. We determined that these disclosures 
appropriately draw attention to the significant areas of estimate.
Specifically in respect of the Falcon 5X programme we performed the 
following audit procedures:
• Obtained and considered a report from management describing their 
impairment test performed, focusing on those areas of the report covering 
the contractual position with the customer, the extent to which any costs 
capitalised prior to cancellation related to technologies which potentially 
were transferrable to a successor aircraft and the level of rework that 
would be expected to be required;
• Obtained the original contract with Dassault and assessed the contractual 
position with the customer, specifically reviewing programme termination/
cancellation clauses; and
• Considered the extent of third party fleet forecast data for the successor 
aircraft for which there remains a significant level of uncertainty. 
Based on the evidence obtained, we concurred that the level of uncertainty 
was so significant that it was not possible to reliably estimate the extent 
to which any of the costs previously capitalised would be recoverable, and 
therefore it was appropriate to record a full impairment loss against all 
balances on the programme. 
We also assessed the Group’s disclosures regarding the critical accounting 
estimates and assumptions in calculating the extent of the impairment 
recorded. We determined that these disclosures appropriately draw attention 
to the significant areas of estimate and uncertainty. 102 MEGGITT PLC

Environmental provisions
Refer also to note 33 of the consolidated financial 
statements (page 144).
The Group has liabilities of £99.9m relating to 
environmental matters.
The environmental matters primarily relate to known 
exposures arising from environmental investigation 
and remediation of certain sites in the US for which the 
Group has been identified as a potentially responsible 
party under US law. The liabilities are based on subjective 
estimates of the level and timing of remediation costs, 
including the period of operating and monitoring 
activities required. Our audit focused on the risk that 
the provisions in relation to these matters could be 
understated.
The Group has separately recognised insurance 
and other receivables of £64.1m. We focused on the 
required asset recognition criteria being met and the 
recoverability of these receivables.
Our work on the valuation of environmental liabilities comprised the following:
• We confirmed that the Group’s external environmental consultants have 
sufficient expertise and are qualified and affiliated with the appropriate 
industry bodies in the respective local territory, and are independent of the 
Group;
• We obtained the cost estimates and reports prepared by the Group’s 
external environmental consultants for the most significant sites. We 
assessed the consistency of the cost estimates year on year and the level 
of costs incurred compared to the prior year estimates to assess the 
historical accuracy of the estimates and to understand significant changes 
to the scope of remediation plans. We confirmed that the changes in scope 
have been appropriately reflected in the provision; 
• We reconciled the cost estimates and reports to the provision recorded 
and gained an understanding of all significant adjustments applied, such 
as differences in the period over which operating and monitoring activities 
are conducted and the application of additional provisions for incremental 
costs. We assessed the reasonableness of these, including reviewing 
historical data where appropriate and considered the provision to be 
supported by reasonable assumptions; and
• Evaluated and concluded that the liabilities, related assets and potential 
exposures were appropriately disclosed in the financial statements.
Our work on the valuation of insurance and other receivables comprised the 
following:
• We obtained the insurance policies and confirmed the coverage limits;
• We obtained confirmation from the insurer of the claims and settlements 
to date and assessed the extent of insurance coverage against the known 
exposures; 
• We obtained evidence of the settlements and claims which resulted in the 
recognition of receivables in relation to the environmental provision and 
found that the evidence obtained supported asset recognition;
• We also obtained evidence of the insurers’ financial position to assess their 
ability to meet the policy obligations and considered the recognition of the 
insurance receivable to be supportable; and
• We performed sensitivity analysis in relation to changes in the timings 
of costs and incremental increases in costs to assess the recoverability 
of the insurance receivables. From the evidence obtained we found the 
assumptions used to be appropriate.

Provisions for uncertain tax positions
Refer also to note 4 of the consolidated financial 
statements (page 122).
The Group has a provision for uncertain tax positions of 
£37.4m.
Estimates have to be made by the directors on the tax 
treatment of a number of transactions in advance of the 
ultimate tax determination being certain.
This is due to the complexity of the Group’s legal 
structure (including multiple legal entities), the number 
of tax jurisdictions (primarily the UK and US) in which 
the Group operates, the complexity of international tax 
legislation and the changing tax environment. In addition, 
uncertainty arises from intergroup transactions relating 
to goods, services and internal financing.
Where the amount of tax payable or recoverable is 
uncertain, the Group establishes provisions based on 
the directors’ judgement of the probable amount of the 
liability, or expected amounts recoverable.
Our audit procedures focused on the risk that conclusion 
of the ultimate tax determination by tax authorities is at 
an amount materially different to the amount recorded.
In conjunction with our internal UK and international tax specialists we:
• Evaluated the process by which the directors calculated each tax exposure 
and assessed whether the assumptions they have used, in conjunction 
with their advisors, in developing the estimated exposure, provided a 
supportable and reasonable basis to calculate the provision for uncertain 
tax positions. From the evidence obtained we found the assumptions and 
methodology used to be appropriate;
• Considered any tax opinions or other tax advice the Group had received 
from its tax advisors in relation to the exposures identified to determine 
that the treatment is consistent with the advice obtained. We also 
considered the evidence of recent tax audits and external tax cases 
which may have an impact on existing tax exposures. Based on the work 
performed we found that this support had been appropriately considered in 
determining management’s provision; 
• Assessed and formed our own views on the key judgements with respect to 
open and uncertain tax positions and concluded that the judgements made 
by the directors were materially consistent with our own views in respect of 
the tax exposures; and
• Evaluated and concluded that the liabilities and potential exposures were 
appropriately disclosed in the financial statements.
Retirement benefit obligation liabilities
Refer also to note 35 of the consolidated financial 
statements (pages 146 to 150) and note 12 of the 
Company financial statements (pages 168 to 169).
The Group has retirement benefit obligations with gross 
liabilities of £1,303.4m, of which £814.5m is recognised 
by the Company. The liabilities are significant in the 
context of the overall Group and Company balance 
sheets.
The valuation of retirement benefit obligations requires 
significant levels of estimation and technical expertise, 
including the use of actuarial experts to support 
the directors in selecting appropriate assumptions. 
Small changes in a number of the key financial and 
demographic assumptions used to value the retirement 
benefit obligations, (including discount rates, inflation 
rates, salary increases and mortality) could have a 
material impact on the calculation of the liability.
Our audit procedures focused on the risk that the 
assumptions used result in an understatement of the 
retirement benefit obligation.
We evaluated the assumptions made in relation to the valuation of the 
liabilities, with input from our actuarial specialists. In particular we:
• Confirmed that the Group’s external specialists, are qualified and affiliated 
with the appropriate industry bodies in the respective local territory, and 
are independent of the Group;
• Tested the discount and inflation rate assumptions used by comparing 
them to our internally developed benchmarks, based on externally derived 
data and comparable organisations. We observed the assumptions to be 
within our expected range;
• Compared assumed mortality rates to national and industry averages. 
From the evidence obtained we found the assumptions to be within our 
expected range and the methodology used to be appropriate;
• Assessed the assumption for salary increases against the Group’s 
historical trend and expected future outlook. The assumption used was 
supported by the evidence we obtained; 
• Considered the appropriateness of the methodology used to update 
estimates from the latest actuarial valuation and assessed changes in 
assumptions in aggregate from the prior year to assess the consistency of 
approach overall. From the evidence obtained we found the assumptions 
and methodology used to be appropriate; and
• Evaluated and concluded that the liabilities and potential exposures were 
appropriately disclosed in the financial statements. 104 MEGGITT PLC

Annual Report and Accounts 2017
How we tailored the audit scope
We tailored the scope of our audit to ensure that we performed 
enough work to be able to give an opinion on the financial 
statements as a whole, taking into account the structure of the 
Group and the Company, the accounting processes and controls, 
and the industry in which they operate.
The Group’s accounting process is structured around a local 
finance function in each of the Group’s reporting units. These 
functions maintain their own accounting records and controls 
(although transactional processing and certain controls for some 
reporting units are performed at the Group’s shared service 
centres) and report to the head office finance team through an 
integrated consolidation system.
In establishing the overall Group audit strategy and plan, we 
determined the type of work that needed to be performed at the 
reporting units by the Group engagement team and by component 
auditors from other PwC network firms. Where the work was 
performed by component auditors, we determined the level of 
involvement we needed to have in the audit work at those reporting 
units so as to be able to conclude whether sufficient appropriate 
audit evidence had been obtained as a basis for our opinion on the 
Group financial statements as a whole.
For each reporting unit we determined whether we required 
an audit of their reported financial information (“full scope”) 
or whether specified procedures addressing specific risk 
characteristics or particular financial statement line items would 
be sufficient. Those where a full scope audit was required included 
the largest reporting unit (Meggitt Aircraft Braking Systems in 
Akron), determined as individually financially significant because it 
contributes more than 15% of the Group’s underlying profit before 
tax. We performed a full scope audit at a further 10 reporting units, 
based on their size or risk. Senior members of the Group audit 
engagement team visited all of these reporting units, to review 
the work undertaken by component auditors and assess the audit 
findings. We also performed specified procedures on 6 reporting 
units to address specific risk characteristics or to provide sufficient 
overall Group coverage. In addition to the work performed at the 
in-scope reporting units, there is a substantial amount of work 
performed at head office by the Group audit engagement team. 
The Group consolidation, financial statement disclosures and a 
number of complex items, prepared by the head office finance 
function, were audited by the Group engagement team. These 
included goodwill, other intangible assets, investments, derivative 
financial instruments and related hedge accounting, bank and other 
borrowings and related finance costs, environmental provisions and 
related insurance receivables, certain onerous contracts and other 
provisions, retirement benefit obligations, current and deferred tax 
and central adjustments raised as part of the consolidation process. 
In aggregate our audit procedures accounted for 61% of Group 
profit before tax; 61% of Group underlying profit before tax; and 
82% of Group total assets (“key coverage metrics”). As a result of 
its structure and size, the Group also has a large number of small 
reporting units that, in aggregate, make up a material portion of the 
key coverage metrics. These small reporting units are covered by 
the work performed by the Group audit engagement team, where 
we perform analytical review procedures. A significant proportion 
of these remaining reporting units not selected for local procedures 
were subject to an analysis of year on year movements, at a 
level of disaggregation to enable a focus on higher risk balances 
and unusual movements. Those not subject to analytical review 
procedures were individually, and in aggregate, immaterial. This 
gave us the evidence we needed for our opinion on the financial 
statements as a whole.
Materiality
The scope of our audit was influenced by our application of 
materiality. We set certain quantitative thresholds for materiality. 
These, together with qualitative considerations, helped us to 
determine the scope of our audit and the nature, timing and extent 
of our audit procedures on the individual financial statement line 
items and disclosures and in evaluating the effect of misstatements, 
both individually and in aggregate on the financial statements as a 
whole. 
Based on our professional judgement, we determined materiality for the financial statements as a whole as follows:
 
Group financial statements Company financial statements
Overall materiality £17.0m (2016: £17.0m). £35.0m (2016: £31.0m).
How we determined it 5% of underlying profit before tax. 1% of total assets.
Rationale for benchmark 
applied
Based on the benchmarks used in the Annual 
Report, underlying profit before tax is the primary 
measure used by the shareholders in assessing the 
performance of the Group. Further, we consider it 
appropriate to eliminate volatility and to preserve the 
link between materiality and the performance of the 
underlying business.
We believe that total assets is the primary 
measure used by the shareholders in assessing the 
performance and position of the entity and reflects the 
Company’s principal activity as a holding company.
For each component in the scope of our Group audit, we allocated a materiality that is less than our overall Group materiality. The range 
of materiality allocated across components was between £0.5m and £15.3m. Certain components were audited to a local statutory audit 
materiality that was also less than our overall Group materiality.
We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to them misstatements identified during our audit above £0.85m (Group audit) 
(2016: £0.85m) and £1.75m (Company audit) (2016: £1.55m) as well as misstatements below those amounts that, in our view, warranted 
reporting for qualitative reasons.

Going concern
In accordance with ISAs (UK) we report as follows:
Reporting obligation Outcome
We are required to report if we have anything material to add or 
draw attention to in respect of the directors’ statement in the 
financial statements about whether the directors considered it 
appropriate to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in 
preparing the financial statements and the directors’ identification 
of any material uncertainties to the Group’s and the Company’s 
ability to continue as a going concern over a period of at least twelve 
months from the date of approval of the financial statements.
We have nothing material to add or to draw attention to. However, 
because not all future events or conditions can be predicted, this 
statement is not a guarantee as to the Group’s and Company’s 
ability to continue as a going concern.
We are required to report if the directors’ statement relating 
to going concern in accordance with Listing Rule 9.8.6R(3) is 
materially inconsistent with our knowledge obtained in the audit.
We have nothing to report.
Reporting on other information 
The other information comprises all of the information in the Annual 
Report other than the financial statements and our auditors’ report 
thereon. The directors are responsible for the other information. 
Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other 
information and, accordingly, we do not express an audit opinion or, 
except to the extent otherwise explicitly stated in this report, any 
form of assurance thereon. 
In connection with our audit of the financial statements, our 
responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, 
consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent 
with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the 
audit, or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If we identify 
an apparent material inconsistency or material misstatement, we 
are required to perform procedures to conclude whether there is 
a material misstatement of the financial statements or a material 
misstatement of the other information. If, based on the work we 
have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement 
of this other information, we are required to report that fact. We 
have nothing to report based on these responsibilities.
With respect to the Strategic report and Directors’ report, we also 
considered whether the disclosures required by the UK Companies 
Act 2006 have been included. 
Based on the responsibilities described above and our work 
undertaken in the course of the audit, the Companies Act 2006, 
(CA06), ISAs (UK) and the Listing Rules of the Financial Conduct 
Authority (FCA) require us also to report certain opinions and 
matters as described below (required by ISAs (UK) unless 
otherwise stated).
Strategic report and Directors’ report
In our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of the 
audit, the information given in the Strategic report and Directors’ 
report for the year ended 31 December 2017 is consistent with the 
financial statements and has been prepared in accordance with 
applicable legal requirements. (CA06)
In light of the knowledge and understanding of the Group and 
Company and their environment obtained in the course of the audit, 
we did not identify any material misstatements in the Strategic 
report and Directors’ report. (CA06)
The directors’ assessment of the prospects of the Group and 
of the principal risks that would threaten the solvency or 
liquidity of the Group
We have nothing material to add or draw attention to regarding:
• The directors’ confirmation on page 40 of the Annual Report 
that they have carried out a robust assessment of the principal 
risks facing the Group, including those that would threaten its 
business model, future performance, solvency or liquidity.
• The disclosures in the Annual Report that describe those risks 
and explain how they are being managed or mitigated.
• The directors’ explanation on page 45 of the Annual Report as to 
how they have assessed the prospects of the Group, over what 
period they have done so and why they consider that period to 
be appropriate, and their statement as to whether they have a 
reasonable expectation that the Group will be able to continue in 
operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due over the period 
of their assessment, including any related disclosures drawing 
attention to any necessary qualifications or assumptions.
We have nothing to report having performed a review of the 
directors’ statement that they have carried out a robust 
assessment of the principal risks facing the Group and statement 
in relation to the longer-term viability of the Group. Our review 
was substantially less in scope than an audit and only consisted of 
making inquiries and considering the directors’ process supporting 
their statements; checking that the statements are in alignment 
with the relevant provisions of the UK Corporate Governance 
Code (the “Code”); and considering whether the statements are 
consistent with the knowledge and understanding of the Group and 
Company and their environment obtained in the course of the audit. 
(Listing Rules) 106 MEGGITT PLC
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Other Code Provisions
We have nothing to report in respect of our responsibility to report 
when: 
• The statement given by the directors, on page 97, that they 
consider the Annual Report taken as a whole to be fair, balanced 
and understandable, and provides the information necessary 
for the members to assess the Group’s and Company’s position 
and performance, business model and strategy is materially 
inconsistent with our knowledge of the Group and Company 
obtained in the course of performing our audit.
• The section of the Annual Report on page 66 describing the work 
of the Audit Committee does not appropriately address matters 
communicated by us to the Audit Committee.
• The directors’ statement relating to the Company’s compliance 
with the Code does not properly disclose a departure from a 
relevant provision of the Code specified, under the Listing Rules, 
for review by the auditors.
Directors’ Remuneration
In our opinion, the part of the Directors’ remuneration report to 
be audited has been properly prepared in accordance with the 
Companies Act 2006. (CA06)
Responsibilities for the financial statements and the 
audit
Responsibilities of the directors for the financial statements
As explained more fully in the Statement of directors’ 
responsibilities set out on pages 96 to 97, the directors are 
responsible for the preparation of the financial statements in 
accordance with the applicable framework and for being satisfied 
that they give a true and fair view. The directors are also responsible 
for such internal control as they determine is necessary to enable 
the preparation of financial statements that are free from material 
misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
In preparing the financial statements, the directors are responsible 
for assessing the Group’s and the Company’s ability to continue as 
a going concern, disclosing as applicable, matters related to going 
concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the 
directors either intend to liquidate the Group or the Company or to 
cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.
Auditors’ responsibilities for the audit of the financial 
statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether 
the financial statements as a whole are free from material 
misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an 
auditors’ report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance 
is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit 
conducted in accordance with ISAs (UK) will always detect a 
material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise 
from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in 
the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the 
economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial 
statements. 
A further description of our responsibilities for the audit of 
the financial statements is located on the FRC’s website 
at: www.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities. This description forms 
part of our auditors’ report.
Use of this report
This report, including the opinions, has been prepared for and only 
for the Company’s members as a body in accordance with Chapter 
3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006 and for no other purpose. 
We do not, in giving these opinions, accept or assume responsibility 
for any other purpose or to any other person to whom this report 
is shown or into whose hands it may come save where expressly 
agreed by our prior consent in writing.
Other required reporting
Companies Act 2006 exception reporting
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if, 
in our opinion:
• We have not received all the information and explanations we 
require for our audit; or
• Adequate accounting records have not been kept by the 
Company, or returns adequate for our audit have not been 
received from branches not visited by us; or
• Certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration specified by law 
are not made; or
• The Company financial statements and the part of the Directors’ 
remuneration report to be audited are not in agreement with the 
accounting records and returns. 
We have no exceptions to report arising from this responsibility. 
Appointment
Following the recommendation of the Audit Committee, we were 
appointed by the members on 2 October 2003 to audit the financial 
statements for the year ended 31 December 2003 and subsequent 
financial periods. The period of total uninterrupted engagement 
is 15 years, covering the years ended 31 December 2003 to 
31 December 2017.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Notes to the consolidated financial statements
When a subsidiary is acquired, the fair value of its identifiable assets 
and liabilities are finalised within 12 months of the acquisition date. 
All fair value adjustments are recognised with effect from the date 
of acquisition and consequently may result in the restatement of 
previously reported financial results. The accounting policies of 
acquired businesses are changed where necessary to be consistent 
with those of the Group.
When a subsidiary is disposed, the difference between the fair value 
of consideration received or receivable and the value at which the 
net assets of the subsidiary were recognised, immediately prior to 
disposal, is recognised in the income statement within net operating 
costs. Any contingent consideration receivable is measured at 
fair value at the date of disposal in determining the gain or loss 
recognised. Contingent consideration receivable is measured at fair 
value at each subsequent balance sheet date, with any changes in 
fair value recognised in the income statement within net operating 
costs. Changes in fair value of contingent consideration receivable 
is excluded from the underlying profit measures used by the Board 
to monitor and measure the underlying performance of the Group 
(see note 10).
When a foreign subsidiary is disposed, the cumulative exchange 
differences relating to the retranslation of the net investment in 
the foreign subsidiary are recognised in the income statement 
as part of the gain or loss on disposal. This applies only to 
exchange differences recognised in equity after 1 January 2004. 
Exchange differences arising prior to 1 January 2004 remain in 
equity on disposal as permitted by IFRS 1 (‘First time Adoption of 
International Financial Reporting Standards’).
Transactions between, and balances with, subsidiary companies 
are eliminated together with unrealised gains on intra-group 
transactions. Unrealised losses are eliminated to the extent the 
asset transferred is not impaired. Unrealised gains and losses on 
transactions with the joint venture are eliminated to the extent of 
the Group’s interest in the arrangement.

pounds sterling. Items included in the financial statements of each 
of the Group’s subsidiaries are measured using the functional 
currency of the primary economic environment in which the 
subsidiary operates.
Transactions and balances
Transactions in foreign currencies are recognised at exchange 
rates prevailing on the dates of the transactions. Monetary assets 
and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are reported at 
exchange rates prevailing at the balance sheet date. Exchange 
differences on retranslating monetary assets and liabilities are 
recognised in the income statement within net operating costs 
except where they relate to qualifying net investment hedges in 
which case exchange differences are recognised in hedging and 
translation reserves within other comprehensive income. 
Foreign subsidiaries
The results of foreign subsidiaries are translated at average 
exchange rates for the period. Assets and liabilities of foreign 
subsidiaries are translated at exchange rates prevailing at the 
balance sheet date. Exchange differences arising from the 
retranslation of the results and opening net assets of foreign 
subsidiaries are recognised in hedging and translation reserves 
within other comprehensive income. Goodwill and fair value 
adjustments arising from the acquisition of a foreign subsidiary 
are treated as assets and liabilities of the subsidiary and are 
retranslated at exchange rates prevailing at the balance sheet date.
1. General information and basis of preparation
Meggitt PLC is a public limited company listed on the London 
Stock Exchange, domiciled in the United Kingdom and 
incorporated in England and Wales with the registered number 
432989. Its registered office is Atlantic House, Aviation Park 
West, Bournemouth International Airport, Christchurch, Dorset, 
BH23 6EW.
Meggitt PLC is the parent company of a Group whose principal 
activities during the year were the design and manufacture of high 
performance components and sub-systems for aerospace, defence 
and other specialist markets, including energy, medical, industrial, 
test and automotive. 
The consolidated financial statements of the Group have been 
prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting 
Standards (‘IFRSs’) as adopted by the European Union and the 
Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under 
IFRS. The consolidated financial statements have been prepared on 
a going concern basis and under the historical cost convention, as 
modified by the revaluation of certain financial assets and financial 
liabilities (including derivative financial instruments) at fair value.
2. Summary of significant accounting policies
The principal accounting policies adopted by the Group in the 
preparation of the consolidated financial statements are set out 
below. These policies have been applied consistently to all periods 
presented unless stated otherwise.
Basis of consolidation
The Group financial statements consolidate the financial 
statements of the Company and all of its subsidiaries together with 
the Group’s share of the results of its joint venture.
A subsidiary is an entity over which the Group has control. The 
Group has control over an entity where the Group is exposed to, 
or has the rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the 
entity, and it has the power over the entity to affect those returns. 
The results of subsidiaries acquired are fully consolidated from 
the date on which control transfers to the Group. The results of 
subsidiaries disposed are fully consolidated up to the date on which 
control transfers from the Group.
A joint venture is a contractual arrangement between the Group and 
one or more other parties, under which control is shared between 
the parties and the Group and other parties have rights to the net 
assets of the arrangement. A joint venture is accounted for using 
the equity method whereby the Group’s share of profits and losses 
of the joint venture is recognised in the income statement within net 
operating costs and its share of net assets and goodwill of the joint 
venture is recognised as an investment.
The cost of an acquisition is the fair value of consideration provided, 
including the fair value of contingent consideration, measured 
at the acquisition date. Contingent consideration payable is 
measured at fair value at each subsequent balance sheet date, with 
changes in fair value recorded in the income statement within net 
operating costs. Identifiable assets and liabilities of an acquired 
business meeting the conditions for recognition under IFRS 3 are 
recognised at fair value at the date of acquisition. The extent to 
which the cost of an acquisition exceeds the fair value of net assets 
acquired is recorded as goodwill. Costs directly attributable to 
an acquisition are recognised in the income statement within net 
operating costs as incurred. Changes in fair value of contingent 
consideration payable and costs of an acquisition are excluded from 
the underlying profit measures used by the Board to monitor and 
measure the underlying performance of the Group (see note 10). STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OTHER INFORMATION
Annual Report and Accounts 2017 MEGGITT PLC 113
Contract accounting revenue
In the majority of instances, the Group is able to reliably estimate 
the outcome of a contract at inception and accordingly recognises 
revenue and cost of sales by reference to the stage of completion 
of the contract. Revenue is typically measured by applying to total 
contract revenue, the proportion costs incurred for work performed 
in the period bear to total estimated contract costs. Where it is not 
possible to reliably estimate the outcome of a contract, revenue 
is recognised equal to costs incurred, provided recovery of such 
costs is probable. If total contract costs are forecast to exceed total 
contract revenue, the expected loss is recognised immediately in 
the income statement within cost of sales.
Revenue from services
Revenue is recognised by reference to the stage of completion 
of the contract. For ‘cost-plus fixed fee’ contracts, revenue 
is recognised equal to the costs incurred plus an appropriate 
proportion of the fee agreed with the customer. For other contracts, 
the stage of completion is typically measured by reference to 
contractual milestones achieved, number of aircraft flying hours 
(power by the hour contracts) or number of aircraft landings (cost 
per brake landing contracts).
Revenue from funded research and development
Revenue is recognised according to the stage of completion of 
the contract. The stage of completion is typically measured by 
reference to contractual milestones achieved.
Exceptional operating items
Items which are significant by virtue of their size or nature, which 
are considered non-recurring and which are excluded from the 
underlying profit measures used by the Board to monitor and 
measure the underlying performance of the Group (see note 10) are 
classified as exceptional operating items. They include, for instance, 
costs directly attributable to the integration of an acquired business 
and significant site consolidation and other restructuring costs. 
Additionally in 2017, given its significance, the impairment loss 
arising from cancellation by the customer of the Dassault Falcon 
5X programme has been treated as an exceptional operating item. 
Exceptional operating items are included within the appropriate 
consolidated income statement category but are highlighted 
separately in the notes to the consolidated financial statements.
Amounts arising on the acquisition, disposal and  
closure of businesses
These items are excluded from the underlying profit measures used 
by the Board to monitor and measure the underlying performance 
of the Group (see note 10). They include, for instance, gains or 
losses made on the disposal or closure of a business, adjustments 
to the fair value of contingent consideration payable in respect of an 
acquired business or receivable in respect of a disposed business 
and costs directly attributable to the acquisition of a business. 
Amounts arising on the acquisition, disposal and closure of 
businesses are included within the appropriate consolidated income 
statement category but are highlighted separately in the notes to 
the consolidated financial statements.
2. Summary of significant accounting policies continued
Segment reporting
Operating segments are those segments for which results are 
reviewed by the Group’s Chief Operating Decision Maker (‘CODM’) 
to assess performance and make decisions about resources to be 
allocated. The CODM has been identified as the Board (see page 60 
of the Corporate governance report). The Group has determined 
that its segments are Meggitt Aircraft Braking Systems, Meggitt 
Control Systems, Meggitt Polymers & Composites, Meggitt Sensing 
Systems and the Meggitt Equipment Group.
The principal profit measure reviewed by the CODM is ‘underlying 
operating profit’ as defined in note 10. A segmental analysis of 
underlying operating profit is accordingly provided in the notes to 
the consolidated financial statements.
Segmental information on assets is provided in the notes to the 
consolidated financial statements in respect of ‘trading assets’, 
which are defined to exclude from total assets, amounts which 
the CODM does not review at a segmental level. Excluded assets 
comprise centrally managed trading assets, goodwill, other 
intangible assets (excluding software assets), investments, 
derivative financial instruments, deferred tax assets, current tax 
recoverable, cash and cash equivalents and assets classified as 
held for sale.
No segmental information on liabilities is provided in the notes 
to the consolidated financial statements, as no such measure is 
reviewed by the CODM.
Revenue recognition
Revenue represents the fair value of consideration received or 
receivable in respect of goods and services provided in the normal 
course of business to external customers, net of trade discounts, 
returns and sales related taxes.
Sale of goods
Revenue is recognised when the significant risks and rewards 
of ownership have transferred to the customer, managerial 
involvement and control of the goods is not retained by the Group, 
the revenue and costs associated with the sale can be measured 
reliably and the collection of related receivables is probable. In the 
majority of instances these conditions are met when delivery to 
the customer takes place. In a minority of instances, ‘bill and hold’ 
arrangements exist whereby revenue is recognised prior to delivery 
but only when the customer has accepted title to the goods, the 
goods are separately identifiable and available for delivery on terms 
agreed with the customer and normal credit terms apply. 114 MEGGITT PLC

Other intangible assets
a) Intangible assets acquired as part of a business combination
For acquisitions, the Group recognises intangible assets separately 
from goodwill provided they are separable or arise from contractual 
or other legal rights and their fair value can be measured reliably. 
Intangible assets are initially recognised at fair value, which is 
regarded as their cost. Intangible assets are subsequently held at 
cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment losses. 
Amortisation is charged on a straight-line basis over the estimated 
useful economic lives of the assets. The nature of intangible assets 
recognised and their estimated useful lives are as follows:
Customer relationships Up to 20 years
Technology Up to 20 years
Trade names and trademarks Up to 15 years
Order backlogs Over period of backlog  
(typically up to 3 years)
Amortisation of intangible assets acquired as part of a business 
combination is excluded from the underlying profit measures used 
by the Board to monitor and measure the underlying performance 
of the Group (see note 10).
b) Software and other intangible assets
Software and purchased licences, trademarks and patents are 
recognised at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment 
losses. Amortisation is charged on a straight-line basis over the 
estimated useful economic lives of the assets, typically over periods 
up to 10 years. Residual values and useful lives are reviewed 
annually and adjusted if appropriate.
Property, plant and equipment 
Property, plant and equipment is recognised at cost less 
accumulated depreciation and impairment losses, except for land 
which is recognised at cost less accumulated impairment losses. 
Cost includes expenditure directly attributable to the acquisition of 
the asset. 
Depreciation is charged on a straight-line basis over the estimated 
useful economic lives of the assets as follows:
Freehold buildings Up to 50 years 
Leasehold property Over period of lease
Plant and machinery 3 to 10 years
Furnaces Up to 20 years
Fixtures and fittings 3 to 10 years
Motor vehicles 4 to 5 years
Residual values and useful lives are reviewed annually and adjusted 
if appropriate. When property, plant and equipment is disposed, 
the difference between sale proceeds, net of related costs, and the 
carrying value of the asset is recognised in the income statement.
2. Summary of significant accounting policies continued 
Intangible assets
Goodwill 
Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquisition over 
the fair value of the Group’s share of identifiable assets acquired 
and liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed. Goodwill is tested 
annually for impairment, and also whenever events or changes in 
circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. 
Goodwill is carried at cost less amortisation charged prior to 
1 January 2004 less accumulated impairment losses. In the event 
a subsidiary to which goodwill relates is disposed, its attributable 
goodwill is included in the determination of the gain or loss on 
disposal.
Research and development
Research expenditure is recognised as an expense in the income 
statement as incurred. Development costs incurred on projects 
where the related expenditure is separately identifiable, measurable 
and management are satisfied as to the ultimate technical and 
commercial viability of the project and that the asset will generate 
future economic benefit based on all relevant available information, 
are recognised as an intangible asset. Capitalised development 
costs are carried at cost less accumulated amortisation and 
impairment losses. Amortisation is charged over periods expected 
to benefit, typically up to 15 years, commencing with launch 
of the product. Development costs not meeting the criteria for 
capitalisation are expensed as incurred. 
Programme participation costs
Programme participation costs consist of incentives given to 
Original Equipment Manufacturers in connection with their selection 
of the Group’s products for installation onto new aircraft where 
the Group has obtained principal supplier status. These incentives 
comprise cash payments and/or the supply of initial manufactured 
parts on a free of charge or deeply discounted basis. Programme 
participation costs are recognised as an intangible asset and 
carried at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment 
losses. For manufactured parts supplied on a free of charge or 
deeply discounted basis, cost represents the cost of manufacture 
transferred from inventory less the value of any revenue received 
or receivable. Amortisation is charged over periods expected to 
benefit from receiving the status of principal supplier, through the 
sale of replacement parts, typically up to 15 years.

Annual Report and Accounts 2017 MEGGITT PLC 115
Impairment of non-current non-financial assets
Assets are reviewed for impairment annually and also whenever 
events or changes in circumstances indicate their carrying value 
may not be recoverable. To the extent carrying value exceeds 
recoverable amount, the difference is recognised as an expense 
in the income statement. The recoverable amount used for 
impairment testing is the higher of value in use and fair value less 
costs of disposal. For the purpose of impairment testing, assets are 
generally tested individually or at a CGU level which represents the 
lowest level for which there are separately identifiable cash inflows 
which are largely independent of cash inflows from other assets or 
groups of assets. Where it is not possible to allocate goodwill on a 
non-arbitrary basis to individual CGUs, it is allocated to the group 
of CGUs which represent the lowest level within the Group at which 
goodwill is monitored by management. At each balance sheet date, 
previously recognised impairment losses, other than any relating 
to goodwill, are reviewed and if no longer required reversed with a 
corresponding credit to the income statement.
Inventories
Inventories are recognised at the lower of cost and net realisable 
value. Cost represents materials, direct labour, other direct costs 
and related production overheads, based on normal operating 
capacity, and is determined using the first-in first-out (FIFO) 
method. Net realisable value is based on estimated selling price, 
less further costs expected to be incurred to completion and 
disposal. Provision is made for obsolete, slow moving or defective 
items where appropriate.
When a subsidiary is acquired, finished goods are recognised at 
fair value, which is typically estimated selling price less costs of 
disposal and a reasonable profit allowance for the selling effort. 
Work in progress is also recognised at fair value at acquisition, 
which is typically estimated selling price less costs to complete, 
costs of disposal and a reasonable profit allowance for work not 
yet completed. When such inventory is subsequently disposed 
post acquisition, the fair value is charged to the income statement. 
The difference between the fair value of the inventory disposed 
and its actual cost of manufacture is excluded from the underlying 
profit measures used by the Board to monitor and measure the 
underlying performance of the Group (see note 10).
Trade and other receivables
Trade receivables are initially recognised at fair value and 
subsequently measured at amortised cost less any impairment 
losses. 
Where the Group recognises a provision, to the extent the 
outflows of economic benefits required to settle the obligation are 
recoverable from an insurer or other third party, an other receivable 
is recognised. Other receivables are discounted to present value 
where the impact is significant, using a pre-tax rate. The discount 
rate used is based on current market assessments of the time value 
of money, adjusted to reflect any risks specific to the receivable 
which have not been reflected in the undiscounted receivable. The 
impact of the unwinding of discounting is recognised in the income 
statement within finance income.
2. Summary of significant accounting policies continued
Borrowing costs
Borrowing costs directly attributable to the construction or 
production of qualifying assets, are capitalised as part of the cost 
of those assets until such time as the assets are substantially ready 
for their intended use. Qualifying assets are those that necessarily 
take a substantial period of time to get ready for their intended use, 
which would generally be at least 12 months. All other borrowing 
costs are recognised in the income statement within finance costs 
as incurred.
Taxation
Current tax is based on taxable profit for the period, calculated 
using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance 
sheet date.
Deferred tax is provided in full using the liability method on 
temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and 
liabilities and their corresponding book values as recognised in the 
Group consolidated financial statements. Deferred tax is provided 
on unremitted earnings of foreign subsidiaries, except where the 
Group can control the remittance and it is probable that earnings 
will not be remitted in the foreseeable future. Deferred tax assets 
are recognised only to the extent it is probable that taxable profits 
will be available against which deductible temporary differences 
can be utilised. Deferred tax is calculated using tax rates enacted or 
substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Current tax and deferred tax are recognised in the income 
statement, other comprehensive income or directly in equity 
depending on where the item to which they relate has been 
recognised. In 2017, given its significance, the tax credit recognised 
in the income statement arising from the reduction in the US federal 
corporate tax rate has been excluded from the Group’s underlying 
profit for the year (see note 10).
Provision is made for current tax liabilities, when the Group has 
a present obligation as a result of past events, it is probable an 
outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation 
and the amount can be reliably estimated. The Group typically uses 
a weighted average of outcomes assessed as possible to determine 
the level of provision required, unless a single best estimate of 
the outcome is considered to be more appropriate. Assessments 
are made at the level of an individual tax uncertainty, unless 
uncertainties are considered to be related, in which case they are 
grouped together. Provisions, which are not discounted given 
the short period over which they are expected to be utilised, are 
included within current tax liabilities. Any liability relating to interest 
on tax liabilities is included within finance costs. 116 MEGGITT PLC
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Provisions
Provision is made for environmental liabilities, onerous contracts, 
product warranty claims and other liabilities when the Group has a 
present obligation as a result of past events, it is more likely than 
not that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle 
the obligation and the amount can be reliably estimated. Provisions 
are discounted to present value where the impact is significant, 
using a pre-tax rate. The discount rate used is based on current 
market assessments of the time value of money, adjusted to reflect 
any risks specific to the obligation which have not been reflected 
in the undiscounted provision. The impact of the unwinding of 
discounting is recognised in the income statement within finance 
costs.
Retirement benefit schemes
For defined benefit schemes, pension costs and the costs of 
providing other post-retirement benefits, principally healthcare, are 
charged to the income statement in accordance with the advice of 
qualified independent actuaries. 
Past service credits and costs and curtailment gains and losses are 
recognised immediately in the income statement.
Retirement benefit obligations represent, for each scheme, the 
difference between the fair value of the schemes’ assets and 
the present value of the schemes’ defined benefit obligations 
measured at the balance sheet date. The defined benefit obligation 
is calculated annually by independent actuaries using the 
projected unit credit method. The present value of the defined 
benefit obligation is determined by discounting the defined benefit 
obligations using interest rates of high quality corporate bonds 
denominated in the currency in which the benefits will be paid and 
with terms to maturity comparable with the terms of the related 
defined benefit obligations. Where the Group has a statutory or 
contractual minimum funding requirement to make contributions 
to a scheme in respect of past service and any such contributions 
are not available to the Group once paid (as a reduction in 
future contributions or as a refund to which the Group has an 
unconditional right either during the life of the scheme or when 
the scheme liabilities are settled), an additional liability for such 
amounts is recognised.
Remeasurement gains and losses are recognised in the period in 
which they arise in other comprehensive income.
For defined contribution schemes, payments are recognised in the 
income statement when they fall due. The Group has no further 
obligations once the contributions have been paid.
2. Summary of significant accounting policies continued
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents include cash in hand and deposits 
held at call with banks. Bank overdrafts are disclosed as current 
liabilities, within bank and other borrowings, except where the 
Group participates in offset arrangements with certain banks 
whereby cash and overdraft amounts are offset against each other.
Trade payables
Trade payables are initially recognised at fair value and 
subsequently measured at amortised cost. Trade payables are not 
interest bearing.
Leases
Leases where the Group has substantially all the risks and rewards 
of ownership are classified as finance leases. Finance leases are 
capitalised at commencement of the lease at the lower of fair 
value of the leased asset and present value of the minimum lease 
payments. Each lease payment is allocated between the liability and 
finance charges to achieve a constant rate on the finance balance 
outstanding. The corresponding lease obligations, net of finance 
charges, are included in liabilities. Assets acquired under finance 
leases are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the shorter of 
the useful life of the asset or the lease term.
Leases in which a significant portion of the risks and rewards of 
ownership are retained by the lessor are classified as operating 
leases. Payments made under operating leases, net of any 
incentives received from the lessor, are charged to the income 
statement on a straight-line basis over the period of the lease.
Borrowings
Borrowings are initially recognised at fair value, being proceeds 
received less directly attributable transaction costs incurred. 
Borrowings are generally subsequently measured at amortised cost 
at each balance sheet date with any transaction costs amortised 
to the income statement over the period of the borrowings using 
the effective interest method. Certain borrowings however are 
designated as fair value through profit and loss at inception, where 
the Group has interest rate derivatives in place which have the 
economic effect of converting fixed rate borrowings into floating 
rate borrowings. Such borrowings are measured at fair value at 
each balance sheet date with any movement in fair value recognised 
in the income statement within net operating costs. Movements in 
fair value are excluded from the underlying profit measures used by 
the Board to monitor and measure the underlying performance of 
the Group (see note 10).
Any related interest accruals are included within borrowings. 
Borrowings are classified as current liabilities unless the Group has 
an unconditional right to defer settlement of the liability for at least 
12 months after the balance sheet date.

Annual Report and Accounts 2017 MEGGITT PLC 117
2. Summary of significant accounting policies continued
Share-based compensation
The Group operates a number of share-based compensation 
schemes, which are principally equity-settled.
For equity-settled schemes, the fair value of an award is measured 
at the date of grant and reflects any market-based vesting 
conditions. At the date of grant, the Group estimates the number 
of awards expected to vest as a result of non market-based vesting 
conditions and the fair value of this estimated number of awards is 
recognised as an expense in the income statement on a straight-
line basis over the period for which services are received. At each 
balance sheet date, the Group revises its estimate of the number 
of awards expected to vest as a result of non market-based vesting 
conditions and adjusts the amount recognised cumulatively in the 
income statement to reflect the revised estimate. When awards 
are exercised and the Company issues new shares, the proceeds 
received, net of any directly attributable transaction costs, are 
credited to share capital (nominal value) and share premium.
Derivative financial instruments and hedging
The Group uses derivative financial instruments to hedge its 
exposure to interest rate risk and foreign currency transactional 
risk. Derivative financial instruments are initially recognised at fair 
value on the date the derivative contract is entered into and are 
subsequently measured at fair value at each balance sheet date 
using values determined indirectly from quoted prices that are 
observable for the asset or liability. 
The method by which any gain or loss arising from subsequent 
measurement at fair value is recognised, depends on whether the 
instrument is designated as a hedging instrument and if so the 
nature of the item hedged. The Group recognises an instrument 
as a hedging instrument by documenting, at its inception, the 
relationship between the instrument and the hedged item and the 
objectives and strategy for undertaking the hedging transaction. 
To be designated as a hedging instrument, an instrument must 
also be assessed, at inception and on an ongoing basis, to be highly 
effective in offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows of hedged 
items. 
To the extent the maturity of the derivative financial instrument is 
more than 12 months from the balance sheet date, the fair value is 
reported as a non-current asset or non-current liability. All other 
derivative financial instruments are reported as current assets or 
current liabilities. 
Fair value hedges
Changes in fair value of derivative financial instruments, that are 
designated and qualify as fair value hedges, are recognised in 
the income statement within net operating costs together with 
changes in fair value of the hedged item. Any difference between 
the movement in fair value of the derivative and the hedged item is 
excluded from the underlying profit measures used by the Board to 
monitor and measure the underlying performance of the Group (see 
note 10). The Group currently applies fair value hedge accounting to 
the hedging of fixed interest rate risk on bank and other borrowings.
Cash flow hedges
Changes in fair value of the effective portion of derivative financial 
instruments, that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges, 
are initially recognised in other comprehensive income. Changes 
in fair value of any ineffective portion are recognised immediately 
in the income statement within net operating costs. To the extent 
changes in fair value are recognised in other comprehensive 
income, they are recycled to the income statement in the periods 
in which the hedged item affects the income statement. The Group 
currently applies cash flow hedge accounting to the hedging of 
floating interest rate risk on bank and other borrowings.
If the hedging instrument is sold or no longer meets the criteria 
for hedge accounting, the cumulative gain or loss previously 
recognised in other comprehensive income is transferred to the 
income statement within net operating costs.
Net investment hedges
Changes in fair value of the effective portion of any hedge are 
recognised in other comprehensive income. Changes in fair value 
of any ineffective portion are recognised immediately in the income 
statement within net operating costs. Cumulative gains and 
losses previously recognised in other comprehensive income are 
transferred to the income statement if the foreign subsidiary to which 
they relate is disposed. Any such gains or losses are excluded from 
the underlying profit measures used by the Board to monitor and 
measure the underlying performance of the Group (see note 10).
Derivatives not meeting the criteria for hedge accounting
Where derivatives do not meet the criteria for hedge accounting, 
changes in fair value are recognised immediately in the income 
statement within net operating costs. Gains and losses arising 
from measuring these derivatives at fair value are excluded from 
the underlying profit measures used by the Board to monitor and 
measure the underlying performance of the Group (see note 10). 
Share capital
Ordinary shares are classified as equity. Incremental costs directly 
attributable to the issue of new shares are deducted from the 
proceeds recognised in equity. 
Own shares represent shares in the Company that are held by 
an independently managed Employee Share Ownership Plan. 
Consideration paid for own shares, including any incremental 
directly attributable costs, is recognised as a deduction from 
retained earnings. 
Dividends
Interim dividends are recognised as liabilities when they are 
approved by the Board. Final dividends are recognised as liabilities 
when they are approved by the shareholders.  118 MEGGITT PLC

2. Summary of significant accounting policies continued
Adoption of new and revised accounting standards
During the year, no new accounting standards became effective which had a significant impact on the Group consolidated financial 
statements.
Recent accounting developments
A number of new standards and amendments and revisions to existing standards have been published and are mandatory for the Group’s 
future accounting periods. They have not been early adopted in these consolidated financial statements. None of these are expected to 
have a significant impact on the consolidated financial statements when they are adopted except as disclosed below:
IFRS 15, ‘Revenue from contracts with customers’
This standard establishes principles for reporting the nature, amount and timing of revenue arising from an entity’s contracts with 
customers. The standard becomes effective for periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018. The Group’s intention is to apply the full 
retrospective approach upon adoption of IFRS 15. This approach requires all open contracts with customers presented in the 2018 
consolidated financial statements to be transitioned under the new standard. Comparative financial information for 2017 will be restated 
with a cumulative adjustment to equity at 1 January 2017. The Group has performed a significant, detailed analysis in order to quantify the 
impact of IFRS 15. The principal areas of the Group’s existing accounting impacted include:
• Programme participation costs – Free of charge/deeply discounted manufactured parts  
Amounts previously recognised as an intangible asset and amortised over their useful lives will now be expensed as incurred.
• Programme participation costs – Cash payments  
The treatment of cash programme payments will depend on the nature of the contractual relationship between the Group and the third 
party to whom the payment is made. Where the payment is made to a third party under a revenue contract (as defined by IFRS 15), or 
the award of future IFRS 15 revenue contracts on the programme from the same party is highly probable, payments will be recognised 
as a contract asset and amortised, as a deduction from revenue, over the periods expected to benefit from those contracts. This 
situation will most frequently arise where payment is made to the same party to whom OE and/or aftermarket parts are sold. Other 
payments, will continue to be recognised as an intangible asset and amortised as a charge to cost of sales.
• Revenue from sale of goods 
The timing of revenue recognised on the substantial majority of contracts is not significantly affected by IFRS 15 with revenue continuing 
to be recognised as goods are delivered to the customer, at the price agreed with the customer for those goods. A minority of contracts 
require changes to the timing of recognition of revenue to reflect IFRS 15 guidance on areas such as the accounting for customer price 
changes, volume discounts, whether multiple deliveries and services provided to a customer should be accounted for individually or 
aggregated and, for certain military contracts, the requirement to recognise revenue over time as parts are manufactured. 
• Contract accounting revenue 
Certain contracts will no longer meet the criteria for revenue to be recognised as work is performed, but will instead only be recognised 
at a point in time, usually when goods are delivered to the customer. Contracts which continue to qualify for revenue to be recognised 
over time will be accounted for as performance occurs, although the method by which performance is measured will, in some instances, 
change under IFRS 15.
• Revenue from power by the hour and cost per brake landing type contracts 
Revenue will no longer be recognised by reference to the number of aircraft flying hours or aircraft landings but when maintenance 
events are carried out.  
• Revenue from other services 
No significant changes to the current method of accounting will arise.
• Revenue from funded research and development contracts 
Revenue will no longer be recognised as contractually agreed milestones are achieved but when control passes to the customer, either 
over time as work is performed or at a point in time as performance obligations are satisfied.

2. Summary of significant accounting policies continued
An assessment of the expected impact of IFRS 15 is shown below. It represents a reasonable estimate of the expected impact on the 
reported results for the year ended 31 December 2017 and on the net assets at that date but is subject to revision during 2018 as the Group 
completes its analysis, particularly for those contracts on which revenue was recognised in the latter part of 2017 under current GAAP.

* Relates to the expensing of amounts capitalised in 2017 and the reversal of the amortisation charge for the year.
The estimated impact on net assets at 31 December 2017 is a reduction of £234.2m from that reported under current GAAP, driven 
principally by the expensing of £285.4m free of charge/deeply discounted manufactured parts and the elimination of the associated 
deferred tax liability held in respect of such amounts.
IFRS 16, ‘Leases’ 
This standard requires recognition on the Group’s balance sheet of assets and liabilities relating to leases which are currently being 
accounted for as operating leases. The standard becomes effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2019 however, 
the Group’s intention is to early adopt this standard in its accounting periods beginning on 1 January 2018. The Group has performed an 
analysis to assess the impact of IFRS 16 and estimates it will recognise additional ‘right of use’ assets, primarily in relation to property 
leases, of £90.0m on the balance sheet at 31 December 2017. Additional lease liabilities of a similar amount will also be recognised, and 
the impact on net assets will not be significant. The operating lease rental expense currently charged to operating profit in the income 
statement for 2017 will be replaced by an amortisation charge for the ‘right of use’ assets recognised in operating profit and an interest 
charge on the lease liabilities recognised in finance costs. The net impact on the income statement for 2017 is not expected to be 
significant. 
3. Financial risk management 
Financial risk factors
The Group’s operations expose it to a number of financial risks including market risk (principally foreign exchange risk and interest rate 
risk), credit risk and liquidity risk. These risks are managed by a centralised treasury department, in accordance with Board approved 
objectives, policies and authorities (see also pages 37 to 38 of the Chief Financial Officer’s review). Regular reports monitor exposures and 
assist in managing the associated risks. 
Market risk
Foreign exchange risk
The Group operates internationally and is subject to foreign exchange risks on future commercial transactions and the retranslation of 
the results of, and net investments in, foreign subsidiaries. The principal exposure arises with respect to the US dollar against the Pound 
sterling. To mitigate risks associated with future commercial transactions, the Group policy is to hedge known and certain forecast 
transaction exposure based on historical experience and projections. The Group hedges at least 70% of the next 12 months anticipated 
exposure and can hedge expected exposures up to five years. Details of hedges in place are provided in note 32. The Group does not hedge 
exposure arising from the retranslation of the results of foreign subsidiaries. The Group uses borrowings denominated in the relevant 
currencies to partially hedge its net investments in foreign subsidiaries.
Interest rate risk
The Group has borrowings issued at both fixed and floating rates of interest. Borrowings issued at fixed rates expose the Group to fair 
value interest rate risk, whereas borrowings issued at floating rates expose the Group to cash flow interest rate risk. The Group’s policy 
is to generally maintain at least 25% of its net debt at fixed rates. The Group mitigates interest rate risks through interest rate derivatives 
which have the economic effect of converting fixed rate borrowings into floating rate borrowings and floating rate borrowings into fixed rate 
borrowings. Details of hedges in place are provided in note 32.
Credit risk
The Group is not subject to significant concentration of credit risk with exposure spread across a large number of customers across the 
world. In addition, many of the Group’s principal customers are either government departments or large multinationals. Note 25 details 
the Group’s credit risk exposures in relation to its customers. Policies are maintained to ensure the Group makes sales to customers with 
an appropriate credit history. Letters of credit, or other appropriate instruments, are put in place to reduce credit risk where considered 
necessary. The Group is also subject to credit risk on the counterparties to its other financial instruments which it controls through only 
dealing with highly rated counterparties and netting transactions on settlement wherever possible. The credit quality of the Group’s 
counterparties is set out in notes 26 and 32. 120 MEGGITT PLC

Liquidity risk
The Group maintains sufficient committed facilities to meet projected borrowing requirements based on cash flow forecasts. Additional 
headroom is maintained to protect against the variability of cash flows and to accommodate small bolt-on acquisitions. Key ratios are 
monitored to ensure continued compliance with covenants contained in the Group’s principal credit agreements. The following table

Sensitivity analysis
The Group’s principal exposure in relation to market risks are to changes in the exchange rate between the US dollar and Pound sterling 
and to changes in US interest rates. The table below illustrates the sensitivity of the Group’s results to changes in these key variables at the 
balance sheet date. The analysis covers only financial assets and liabilities held at the balance sheet date and is made on the basis of the 
hedge designations in place on those dates and assuming no hedge ineffectiveness.

The impact on equity from movements in the exchange rate comprises £93.8m (2016: £124.8m) in respect of US dollar net debt, and 
£1.1m (2016: offset by £1.8m) in respect of other financial assets and liabilities. However, as all US dollar net debt is designated as a net 
investment hedge, this element of the impact is entirely offset by the retranslation of foreign subsidiaries. The impact of a 1% movement in 
the US yield curve includes the effect on the Group’s foreign currency forward contracts and other financial assets and liabilities.
Capital risk management
The Group’s objective when managing its capital structure is to minimise the cost of capital whilst maintaining adequate capital to protect 
against volatility in earnings and net assets. The strategy is designed to maximise shareholder return over the long-term. The Group’s post-
tax weighted average cost of capital at 31 December 2017 is approximately 6.2% (2016: 6.2%) and its capital structure is as follows: 
 
2017 
£’m

Net debt (see note 42) 964.8 1,179.1
Total equity 2,556.4 2,456.4

The Board believes that in maintaining an efficient balance sheet, a net debt:EBITDA ratio of between 1.5x and 2.5x is appropriate,  
whilst retaining the flexibility to move outside the range if appropriate. Further details on the Group’s strategy for delivering  
net debt:EBITDA in this range can be found on page 37 and 38 of the Chief Financial Officer’s review, which includes details on how the 
Group has complied with the two principal financial covenant requirements contained in its committed credit facilities.

4. Critical accounting estimates and judgements
In applying the Group’s accounting policies set out in note 2, the Group is required to make certain estimates and judgements concerning 
the future. These estimates and judgements are regularly reviewed and revised as necessary. The estimates and judgements that have the 
most significant effect on the amounts included in these consolidated financial statements are described below. Further consideration of 
these critical estimates and judgements can be found in the Audit Committee report on page 67.
Critical accounting estimates and assumptions 
Impairment testing of goodwill
Each year the Group carries out impairment tests of goodwill which require estimates to be made of the value in use of its CGU’s or groups 
of CGU’s. These value in use calculations are dependent on estimates of future cash flows, long-term growth rates and appropriate 
discount rates to be applied to future cash flows. Further details on these estimates and sensitivities of the carrying value of goodwill to 
these estimates are provided in note 18.
Cancellation of Dassault Falcon 5X programme
On 13 December 2017, Dassault Aviation (“Dassault”) announced the cancellation of its Falcon 5X programme and the launch of a new 
Falcon programme featuring the same cross section, but powered by Pratt & Whitney Canada engines rather than the Silvercrest engine 
selected for the Falcon 5X. Dassault forecast the new aircraft will enter into service in 2022 and indicate they expect to re-use a maximum 
of work undertaken to date on the Falcon 5X and to work with Meggitt on the successor programme.
Prior to cancellation, the most recent impairment testing performed by the Group, using third party fleet forecast information, had not 
identified any requirement for an impairment. At the date of cancellation, the Group had assets of £59.5m on the balance sheet related to 
the Falcon 5X and Silvercrest engine (principally development costs incurred by Meggitt Aircraft Braking Systems). The cancellation has 
required the Group to perform an additional impairment test to reassess the estimated recoverable value of these assets. In making this 
estimate, the Group has taken into consideration the contractual position with the customer, the considerable uncertainty surrounding 
the successor programme design and the extent to which this new design will impact the braking system and require significant rework, 
for instance from increases in the maximum take-off weight. The Group has also considered the lack of reliable fleet forecasts for the 
new aircraft, forecast delays in entry into service of the new aircraft compared to the Falcon 5X and the extent to which the cancellation 
significantly reduces forecast demand for the Silvercrest engine. The Group has concluded that the level of uncertainty in these areas is 
so significant that it is not possible to reliably estimate the extent to which any of the costs previously held on the balance sheet will be 
recoverable and accordingly has recognised a full impairment of these assets in 2017 (see note 11). 
Given cancellation occurred late in 2017, it is possible that over the course of 2018 there will be progress made to resolve some of the areas 
of uncertainty referred to above. Depending on the outcome of these uncertainties, it is therefore reasonably foreseeable that an element 
of the impairment loss recognised in 2017 may be reversed in 2018. The Group has considered whether a contingent asset should be 
disclosed however, until these uncertainties are resolved, it is not possible to quantify the extent of any reversal in order to ascribe a value 
to any such asset.
Retirement benefit obligations
The liability recognised in respect of retirement benefit obligations is dependent on a number of estimates including those relating to 
mortality, inflation, salary increases and the rate at which liabilities are discounted. External actuarial advice is taken with regard to the 
most appropriate assumptions to use. Further details on these estimates and sensitivities of the retirement benefit obligations to these 
estimates are provided in note 35.
Environmental provisions
The Group is involved in the investigation and remediation of environmental contamination at certain sites for which it has been identified 
as a potentially responsible party under US law (see note 33 for further details). In determining the provision to be recognised, advice is 
received by the Group from its environmental consultants and legal advisors to assist in the estimate of the level and timing of remediation 
costs, including the period for which operations and monitoring activities will be required to be carried out. These estimates are revised 
regularly as remediation activities progress and further information is obtained on the extent of activities to be performed by the Group. In 
the last five years, both annual reductions and annual increases in costs estimates have been experienced. If the cost estimates on which 
the provision at 31 December 2017 is based were to change by 15%, the largest observed overall annual movement seen in this five year 
period, the provision recognised would need to change by approximately £15.0m. During the last five years, no significant changes to the 
estimated period for which operations and maintenance activities will be required have been necessary. However, as the period for which 
groundwater testing has been performed increases, the results of that testing provide a more reliable estimate of the extent to which such 
activities will continue to be required in the future. It is reasonably foreseeable that, depending on groundwater testing results in 2018, 
the periods for which operations and maintenance will be required could increase by up to five years. Were an increase of five years to be 
required, the provision recognised would need to increase by approximately £8.0m.
The Group has extensive insurance arrangements in place to mitigate the ongoing impact of historical environmental events on the 
Group (see note 33 for further details). These insurance policies however, have monetary caps and in some cases are term policies, 
whereby costs are only recoverable if incurred by specified dates. The estimates of the extent and timing of remediation costs, used 
to determine the provision, are also used in determining the level of receivable to recognise. If remediation cost estimates were to 
change by 15%, the receivable recognised would need to change by approximately £4.0m reflecting the impact of the insurance policy 
caps in place. If additionally, the estimated period for which operations and maintenance is required were to increase by five years, the 
receivable recognised would need to increase by £1.7m. Whilst the timing of remediation is based on advice from third party environmental 
consultants, it is possible that delays could occur with site excavation activities. However, progress on remediation activities during 2017 
has been significant on those sites where term insurance policies are in place and accordingly the Group no longer considers that any 
reasonably foreseeable future delays will have a significant impact on the insurance receivable recognised. 122 MEGGITT PLC

Annual Report and Accounts 2017
4. Critical accounting estimates and judgements continued
Income taxes
In determining the Group’s tax provision, it is necessary to consider transactions in a small number of key tax jurisdictions for which the 
ultimate tax determination is uncertain. The Group’s tax provision at 31 December 2017 is £37.4m (2016: £43.4m) and reflects a number 
of areas of judgement where the amount of tax payable is either currently under audit by the tax authorities or relates to a period which 
has yet to be audited. These areas include the deductibility of interest on certain borrowings used to finance acquisitions made by the 
Group and the price at which goods and services are transferred between Group companies. The nature of the items, for which a provision 
is held, is such that the final outcome could vary from the amounts held once a final tax determination is made, although currently none of 
these exposures is considered individually material. Based on the Group’s recent experience of revisions to previous tax estimates as more 
information has become available, and assuming no significant changes in legislation from those already announced, it currently expects 
the outcome across all open items to range from a potential increase of £7.0m in the provision to a potential reduction of £8.0m. To the 
extent the estimated final outcome differs from the tax that has been provided, adjustments will be made to income tax and deferred tax 
balances held in the period the determination is made. 
Critical accounting judgements
Level at which impairment testing of goodwill is performed
Goodwill is required to be allocated to CGUs or groups of CGUs for the purpose of impairment testing. In the Group’s judgement, with the 
exception of businesses within its Equipment Group segment and the advance composite businesses acquired in late 2015, it is appropriate 
to allocate goodwill to the group of CGUs represented by its operating segments. In making this judgement, the Group considers that the 
extent of consolidation of activities within each segment (other than in the Meggitt Equipment Group) is such that allocating goodwill to 
individual CGU’s within that segment would require management to perform significant arbitrary allocations. The allocation of goodwill at a 
segment level is consistent with the level at which it is monitored by management.
The cash inflows of the two advanced composites businesses are not considered independent of one another, and continue to be treated 
as a single CGU. Although integration of the activities of the CGU with the rest of the businesses within its operating segment is progressing 
well, it is still possible to reliably allocate goodwill to the CGU and it continues to be monitored by management at this level. Accordingly 
impairment testing in the year has been performed at the CGU level. Due to the nature of CGUs within the Meggitt Equipment Group, which 
principally operate independently of one another, goodwill can be reliably allocated to each CGU within the segment for testing.
Capitalisation of development costs
The Group is required to make judgements as to when development costs meet the criteria to be recognised as intangible assets. The 
majority of capitalised development costs relate to technology developed for aerospace programmes. In such cases, costs are typically not 
capitalised until a contract to develop the technology is awarded by a customer as, prior to this date, it is generally not possible to reliably 
estimate the point at which research activities conclude and development activities commence. Absent a contract, the Group also does 
not believe there is generally sufficient certainty over the future economic benefits that will be generated from the technology, to allow 
capitalisation of those costs. Post contract award, the Group will capitalise development costs provided it expects to retain the intellectual 
property in the technology throughout substantially all of the life of the aircraft or engine and it is probable that future economic benefits 
will flow to the Group. In making a judgement as to whether economic benefits will arise, the Group will make estimates of aircraft or engine 
volumes (taking into account the extent to which the Group has a sole-source position), aftermarket revenues which are dependent on 
aircraft utilisation, fleet lives and operator service routines, costs of manufacture and costs to complete the development activity. During 
2017, the Group recognised £61.3m of development costs as an intangible asset (see note 19).
Capitalisation of programme participation costs
The Group is required to make judgements as to when programme participation costs meet the criteria to be recognised as intangible 
assets. Approximately 85% of capitalised programme participation costs relate to free of charge or deeply discounted manufactured parts 
(‘FOC’), with the balance relating to cash programme payments. All amounts relate to aerospace programmes. FOC costs are typically 
incurred just prior to individual aircraft entering service and only where the Group is satisfied it is probable the costs will be recovered 
through incremental aftermarket revenues generated over the life of the part, will amounts be capitalised. In making this judgement, the 
Group makes estimates of aftermarket revenues which are dependent on aircraft utilisation, fleet lives and operator service routines. The 
capitalisation of cash payments is subject to similar judgements to those described for development costs above. During 2017, the Group 
recognised £60.3m of programme participation costs as an intangible asset (see note 19).

10. Reconciliations between profit and underlying profit
Underlying profit is used by the Board to monitor and measure the underlying trading performance of the Group. It excludes certain items 
as described below.
Delivery of the Group’s strategy includes investment in acquisitions that enhance its technology portfolio and the restructuring of its 
cost base to deliver operational improvements. The exclusion of significant items arising from M&A activity and business restructuring 
is designed by the Board to align short-term operational decisions with this longer-term strategy. Accordingly amounts arising on the 
acquisition, disposal and closure of businesses, amortisation of intangible assets acquired in business combinations, disposal of inventory 
revalued in business combinations, business restructuring and site consolidation costs are excluded from underlying profit measures. 
Due to the significance of the impairment loss arising from cancellation of the Dassault Falcon 5X programme and of the tax credit arising 
from the reduction in the US rate of federal corporate tax, these amounts have been excluded from underlying profit measures for 2017. 
To ensure appropriate and timely commercial decisions are made as to when and how to mitigate the Group’s foreign currency and 
interest rate exposures, gains and losses arising from the marking to market of financial instruments that are not hedge accounted are also 
excluded from underlying profit measures. The Board considers net interest expense on retirement benefit obligations to be a non-trading 
item and accordingly excludes it from underlying profit measures.
Items excluded from underlying profit measures are treated consistently with the way performance is measured under the Group’s  
short term and long term incentive plans and covenant requirements defined in the Group’s committed credit facilities.

c. IFRS 3 requires finished goods acquired in a business combination to be recognised at fair value, which is typically estimated selling 
price less costs of disposal and a reasonable profit allowance for the selling effort. Work in progress acquired in a business combination 
is recognised at fair value, which is typically estimated selling price less costs to complete, costs of disposal and a reasonable profit 
allowance for work still to be carried out. The fair value of acquired inventory is thus significantly higher than the same items built post 
acquisition, the value of which includes no profit element. The difference between the fair value of the inventory consumed and its cost 
is excluded from the Group’s underlying profit figures.
 d. Although the Group uses foreign currency forward contracts to hedge against foreign currency exposures, it has decided that the 
costs of meeting the extensive documentation requirements to be able to apply hedge accounting under IAS 39 ‘Financial Instruments: 
Recognition and Measurement’ are not merited. The Group’s underlying profit figures exclude amounts which would not have been 
recognised if hedge accounting had been applied.
 Where interest rate derivatives qualify to be hedge accounted, any difference between the movement in fair value of the derivatives 
and in the fair value of fixed rate borrowings is excluded from underlying profit. Where cross currency derivatives and treasury lock 
derivatives do not qualify to be hedge accounted, movements in fair value of the derivatives are excluded from underlying profit.

a. On 13 December 2017, Dassault Aviation announced the cancellation of its Falcon 5X programme. The cancellation has resulted in a 
cost of £59.5m being recognised in the year, comprising an impairment loss of £54.4m in respect of capitalised development costs, 
an impairment loss of £1.5m in respect of programme participation costs and £3.6m in respect of the reduction of inventory to net 
realisable value (see note 4). 
b. In 2017, this relates principally to initial costs incurred in respect of the move to a new facility being constructed at Ansty Park in the 
West Midlands which will enable the Group to consolidate a range of manufacturing, engineering and support operations into a single 
centre of excellence. In addition, it includes costs relating to the closure of the Group’s control systems operations in Corona, California 
and transfer of its activities to two of the Group’s other existing operations in California. 
c. This relates to costs incurred in respect of the ongoing integration of the Advanced Composites and EDAC businesses acquired in 
November and December 2015 respectively and of Elite Aerospace acquired in March 2017.
The tax credit in respect of exceptional operating items is £25.9m (2016: £4.9m).

Tax (credit)/charge (87.6) 24.3
On 22 December 2017, the US government enacted comprehensive tax legislation commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act 
(“TCJA”). The TCJA makes substantial changes to the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. Among those changes is a significant 
reduction in the generally applicable US federal corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%, with effect from 1 January 2018. The Group’s deferred 
tax balances relating to its US operations have been remeasured to reflect this rate reduction. The impact of the rate reduction is a credit 
to the income statement of £122.6m, a charge to other comprehensive income of £11.7m in respect of retirement benefit obligations, a 
charge recognised directly in equity of £0.3m in respect of share-based payments and a corresponding reduction in deferred tax liabilities 
of £110.6m.
The Finance (No 2) Act 2015, included legislation to reduce the main rate of corporation tax in the UK from 20% to 19% with effect 
from 1 April 2017 and to 18% with effect from 1 April 2020. The Finance Act 2016, included legislation to further reduce the main rate 
of corporation tax in the UK to 17% from 1 April 2020. As these changes were substantively enacted in prior years, they have had no 
significant impact on the tax charge for the current year.

*  Calculated as the weighted average tax rate applicable to profits of the Group’s businesses in their respective countries in the year. It does not therefore reflect any 
changes in tax rates that have been substantively enacted, but are not applicable until future periods. The sensitivity of the tax charge to changes in the tax rate is such 
that a one percentage point increase, or reduction, in the tax rate would cause the total taxation charge for 2017 to increase, or reduce respectively, by approximately 
£14.1m of which £11.5m arises from the impact of the change in tax rate on net deferred tax liabilities. 130 MEGGITT PLC

15. Earnings per ordinary share
Earnings per ordinary share (‘EPS’) is calculated by dividing the profit attributable to owners of the Company by the weighted average 
number of shares in issue during the year. The weighted average number of shares excludes treasury shares and any shares bought by the 
Group and held during the year by an independently managed Employee Share Ownership Plan Trust (see note 38). The weighted average 
number of treasury shares excluded is Nil shares (2016: 0.2m shares) and the weighted average number of own shares excluded is 2.4m 
shares (2016: 1.5m shares). The calculation of diluted EPS adjusts the weighted average number of shares to reflect the assumption that all 
potentially dilutive ordinary shares convert. For the Group, this means assuming all share awards in issue are exercised.

Annual Report and Accounts 2017
18. Goodwill continued
For each CGU or group of CGUs, the Group has determined its recoverable amount from value in use calculations. The value in use 
calculations are based on cash flow forecasts derived from the most recent budgets and plans for the next five years, as approved by 
management in December 2017. Cash flows for periods beyond five years are extrapolated using estimated growth rates. The resultant 
cash flows are discounted using a pre-tax discount rate appropriate to the relevant CGU or group of CGU’s. 
The key assumptions for the value in use calculations are as follows:
• Sales volumes over the five years covered by management’s detailed plans  
These are based on management estimates for growth in civil aerospace OE, civil aerospace aftermarket, military and energy markets, 
and reflect the position each business has on individual aerospace and other programmes. They are derived from industry forecasts 
for deliveries of large jets, regional aircraft and business jets; air traffic growth; military spending by the US DoD and other major 
governments; and oil prices. The exposure of MABS, MCS, MPC and MSS to these markets, is set out in the Strategic report on pages 24 
to 29. MTS operates entirely within the military market. The Group’s medium term expectations for growth in each of these markets, is 
set out in the Strategic report on pages 22 to 24. 
•  Selling prices and production cost changes over the five years covered by management’s detailed plans 
These are based on contractual agreements with customers and suppliers; management’s past experience and expectations of future 
market changes; and the continued maturity of the Meggitt Production System. 
•  Growth rates used for periods beyond those covered by management’s detailed budgets and plans 
Growth rates are derived from management’s estimates which take into account the long-term nature of the industry in which each 
CGU or group of CGUs operates; external industry forecasts of long-term growth in the aerospace and defence sectors; the extent to 
which a CGU or group of CGUs has sole-source positions on platforms where it is able to share in a continuing stream of highly profitable 
aftermarket revenues; the maturity of the platforms it supplies; and the technological content of its products. For the purpose of 
impairment testing, a conservative approach has been used and where the derived rate is higher than the long-term GDP growth rates 
for the principal countries in which the CGU or group of CGUs operates (UK: 2.0% (2016: 2.1%), US: 2.3% (2016: 2.3%)), the latter has 
been used.
•  Discount rates applied to future cash flows  
The Group’s pre-tax weighted average cost of capital (WACC) is used as the foundation for determining the discount rates to be 
applied. The WACC is then adjusted to reflect risks specific to the CGU or group of CGUs not already reflected in its future cash flows. 
The discount rates used are as follows: MABS 10.0% (2016: 9.6%), MCS 10.7% (2016: 10.2%), MPC excluding EDAC & Advanced 
Composites 10.1% (2016: 9.9%), EDAC & Advanced Composites 10.1% (2016: 10.1%), MSS 8.3% (2016: 8.4%) and MTS 11.9% 
(2016: 11.3%). The discount rates used for ‘Other’ CGUs range from 9.1% to 12.0% (2016: 8.7% to 12.0%).
A sensitivity analysis is carried out at each level at which impairment testing is performed to determine the extent to which assumptions 
would need to change for the calculated recoverable amount from value in use, to fall below its carrying value of goodwill. Management 
has concluded that no reasonably foreseeable change in the key assumptions used in the impairment model would result in a significant 
impairment charge being recognised in the consolidated financial statements. The least headroom in percentage terms are in MABS, MTS 
and EDAC & Advanced Composites. To require an impairment in the Group consolidated financial statements, one of the following would 
be required:

Composites

in respect of development costs and £1.5m in respect of programme participation costs have been charged to exceptional operating items following cancellation of the 
Dassault Falcon 5X programme (see note 11). 
The net book amount of development costs includes £205.1m (2016: £246.3m) in respect of Meggitt Aircraft Braking Systems which have 
an estimated weighted average remaining life of 14.7 years (2016: 14.6 years). 
The net book amount of programme participation costs comprises £285.4m (2016: £283.4m) in respect of free of charge/deeply 
discounted manufactured parts and £46.7m (2016: £50.1m) in respect of cash programme payments. The net book amount of programme 
participation costs includes £294.3m (2016: £303.5m) in respect of Meggitt Aircraft Braking Systems which have an estimated weighted 
average remaining life of 8.6 years (2016: 9.2 years).
The programme with the largest capitalised balance is the Bombardier CSeries with a net book amount of £112.5m (2016: £108.0m), 
comprising development costs of £80.4m (2016: £85.5m) and programme participation costs of £32.1m (2016: £22.5m). Fleet volumes 
would need to fall to approximately 350 (a reduction of 65% from management estimates, which are based on public forecasts from 
industry experts), without any mitigation actions taken by the Group, before any impairment would need to be recognised.
Interest has been capitalised using the average rate payable on the Group’s floating rate borrowings of 2.0% (2016: 1.5%). Tax relief 
claimed on interest capitalised in the year is £0.8m (2016: £0.8m). 134 MEGGITT PLC

The Group issued USD 600.0m of loan notes to private placement investors in 2010. The notes were in four tranches as follows:  
USD 200.0m carried an interest rate of 4.62% and were repaid in 2017; USD 125.0m carry an interest rate of 5.02% and are due for 
repayment in 2020; USD 150.0m carry an interest rate of 5.17% and are also due for repayment in 2020; and USD 125.0m carry an interest 
rate of 5.12% and are due for repayment in 2022.
The Group issued USD 600.0m of loan notes to private placement investors in 2016. The notes are in two tranches as follows: USD 300.0m 
carry an interest rate of 3.31% and are due for repayment in 2023; and USD 300.0m carry an interest rate of 3.60% and are due for 
repayment in 2026.
In 2014, the Group secured a five-year USD 900.0m syndicated revolving credit facility which matures in 2021, following a one-year 
extension agreed during 2015 and a further one-year extension agreed during 2016. During the year, the Group reduced the facility to 
USD 750.0m. At 31 December 2017, the amounts drawn under the facility are £255.0m (2016: £346.0m) represented by borrowings 
denominated in US dollars. Borrowings under the facility are subject to interest at floating rates which are linked to LIBOR.
In 2016, the Group executed a commitment offer letter from Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation for the provision of a three-year 
£75.0m committed bilateral facility to commence between 1 September 2017 and 15 October 2017. Prior to the facility commencing, the 
Group cancelled the commitment. 140 MEGGITT PLC

Fair value measurement and hierarchy
For trade and other receivables, cash and cash equivalents, trade and other payables, obligations under finance leases and the current 
element of floating rate bank and other borrowings, fair values approximate to book values due to the short maturity periods of these 
financial instruments. For trade and other receivables, allowances are made within their book value for credit risk. 
Derivative financial instruments measured at fair value, are classified as level 2 in the fair value measurement hierarchy, as they have been 
determined using significant inputs based on observable market data. The fair values of interest rate derivatives have been derived from 
forward interest rates based on yield curves observable at the balance sheet date and contractual interest rates. The fair values of foreign 
currency forward contracts have been derived from forward exchange rates observable at the balance sheet date and contractual forward 
rates. The fair values of cross currency derivatives have been derived from forward interest rates based on yield curves observable at the 
balance sheet date, forward exchange rates observable at the balance sheet date and contractual interest and forward rates.
The non-current portion of bank and other borrowings measured at fair value, is classified as level 3 in the fair value measurement 
hierarchy, as it has been determined using significant inputs which are a mixture of those based on observable market data (interest rate 
risk) and those not based on observable market data (credit risk). The fair value attributable to interest rate risk has been derived from 
forward interest rates based on yield curves observable at the balance sheet date and contractual interest rates, with the credit risk margin 
kept constant. The fair value attributable to credit risk has been derived from quotes from lenders for borrowings of similar amounts and 
maturity periods. The same methods of valuation have been used to derive the fair value of the current and non-current element of bank 
and other borrowings which are held at amortised cost, but for which fair values are provided in the table above.
There are no transfers of assets or liabilities between levels of the fair value hierarchy in the year.
Financial liabilities designated as fair value through profit and loss
Cumulative unrealised changes in fair value of the current and non-current portions of bank and other borrowings arising from changes in 
credit risk are as follows:

The largest movement in credit spread seen in a six month period since inception of the borrowings is 70 basis points. A 70 basis point 
movement in the credit spread used as an input in determining fair value at 31 December 2017, would impact net operating costs by 
approximately £5.0m.

Interest rate swaps
The total notional principal amount of outstanding interest rate swap contracts at 31 December 2017 is £340.7m (2016: £453.2m), of which 
£118.5m will expire in 2018, £129.6m will expire in 2020 and £92.6m will expire in 2022. The contracts are all denominated in US dollars. 
Of the notional principal amount outstanding, £118.5m (2016: £129.5m) has the economic effect of converting floating rate US dollar 
borrowings into fixed rate US dollar borrowings and £222.2m (2016: £323.7m) has the economic effect of converting fixed rate US dollar 
borrowings into floating rate US dollar borrowings. To the extent they continue to meet the criteria for hedge accounting, the floating rate 
to fixed rate swap contract is accounted for as a cash flow hedge and the fixed rate to floating rate swap contracts as fair value hedges. 
Cross currency swaps
The cross currency swaps have been used to synthetically convert US dollar denominated floating borrowings into Swiss franc and Euro 
denominated fixed borrowings to commercially hedge against Swiss franc and Euro denominated assets of foreign subsidiaries. The cross 
currency swaps do not qualify to be hedge accounted.  144 MEGGITT PLC

a.  Provision has been made for known exposures arising from environmental remediation at a number of sites (see note 4). The Group’s 
operations and facilities are subject to laws and regulations that govern the discharge of pollutants and hazardous substances into 
the ground, air and water as well as the handling, storage and disposal of such materials and other environmental matters. Failure to 
comply with its obligations potentially exposes the Group to serious consequences, including fines, other sanctions and limitations on 
operations. The Group is involved in the investigation and remediation of current and former sites for which it has been identified as 
a potentially responsible party under US law. Provision has been made for the expected costs arising from these activities based on 
information currently available. Provisions are expected to be substantially utilised over the next fifteen years and are discounted, where 
appropriate, using an appropriate discount rate. A receivable has been established to the extent these costs are recoverable under the 
Group’s environmental insurance policies or from other parties. Movements in the receivable are shown in the table above (see also 
note 25).
b.  Provision has been made for estimated losses under certain trading contracts. Provisions are expected to be substantially utilised over 
the next five years and are not discounted given the short period over which they will be utilised.
c.  Provision has been made for product warranty claims. Provisions are expected to be utilised over the next three years and are not 
discounted given the short period over which they will be utilised.
d.  A number of asbestos related claims have been made against subsidiary companies of the Group. To date, the amount connected with 
such claims in any year has not been material and many claims are covered fully or partly by existing insurance and indemnities. There is 
a provision, included within other provisions, for certain claims which cannot be recovered from insurers. Provisions are expected to be 
substantially utilised over the next ten years and are discounted, where appropriate, using a discount rate appropriate to each provision.

The Group has unrecognised tax losses of £24.3m (2016: £24.3m) for which no deferred tax asset has been recognised. No asset has 
been recognised in respect of these losses, as it is not regarded as more likely than not that they will be recovered. Deferred tax assets not 
recognised, would be recoverable in the event they reverse and suitable taxable profits are available. There are no unremitted earnings in

Pension schemes
The Group operates a number of pension schemes for the benefit of its employees. The nature of each scheme which has a significant 
impact on the consolidated financial statements is as follows: 
• In the UK, the Group operates a funded defined benefit scheme which is closed to new members but open to future accrual for existing 
members; 
• In the US, the Group operates five defined benefit schemes, all of which are closed to new members. With two exceptions, these 
schemes are open to future accrual for existing members. The schemes are a mixture of funded and unfunded schemes; and 
• In Switzerland, the Group operates a funded defined benefit scheme which is open to new members and to future accrual. 
The UK and US schemes provide benefits to members in the form of a guaranteed level of pension payable for life. The benefits provided 
depend on a member’s length of service. For the majority of schemes, the benefits are also dependent on salary at retirement or average 
salary over employment in the final years leading up to retirement. In the US, one scheme provides a fixed benefit for each year of service. 
The Swiss scheme has many of the characteristics of a defined contribution scheme but provides for certain minimum benefits to be 
guaranteed to members. 
For all funded schemes, benefit payments are made from funds administered by third parties unrelated to the Group. The assets of such 
schemes are held in trust funds, or their equivalent, separate from the Group’s finances.
The UK scheme is a registered scheme and subject to the statutory scheme-specific funding requirements outlined in UK legislation, 
including the payment of levies to the Pension Protection Fund. It is established under trust and the responsibility for its governance lies 
with the trustees who also agree funding arrangements with the Group.
The funded US schemes are tax-qualified pension schemes regulated by the Pension Protection Act 2006 and are insured by the Pension 
Benefit Guarantee Corporation up to certain limits. They are established under, and governed by, the US Employee Retirement Income 
Security Act 1974. Meggitt is a named fiduciary with the authority to manage the operation of the US schemes.
The Swiss scheme is a tax qualified pension plan subject to the Swiss Federal Law on Occupational Retirement, Survivors’ and Disability 
Pension Plans which constitutes a legal framework setting out the minimum requirements for occupational pension plans. Responsibility 
for its governance lies with a foundation, which is similar in nature to a UK trustee board.
For all unfunded schemes, benefit payments are made by the Group as obligations fall due. The Group also operates a number of defined 
contribution schemes under which the Group has no further obligations once contributions have been paid.
Healthcare schemes
The Group has two principal other post-retirement benefit schemes providing medical and life assurance benefits to certain employees, 
and former employees, of Meggitt Aircraft Braking Systems Corporation and Meggitt (Rockmart), Inc. These schemes are unfunded and 
closed to new members.

In determining the fair value of scheme liabilities, the Group uses mortality assumptions which are based on published mortality tables 
adjusted to reflect the characteristics of the scheme populations. The Group’s mortality assumptions in the UK are based on recent 
mortality investigations of Self Administered Pension Schemes adjusted to reflect the profile of the membership of the scheme, which 
include the results of an analysis of members used to support the 2015 triennial UK actuarial valuation. Allowance has been made for rates 
of mortality to continue to fall at the rate of 1.25% per annum.
In the US, mortality assumptions are based on the RPH-2014 headcount weighted table, for schemes where benefits are not salary-
linked, and the RP-2014 table for other schemes, with both tables projecting rates of mortality to fall using the 2017 Social Security 
Administration’s Intermediate-Cost Projections scale.

Details on the sensitivity of scheme liabilities to changes in assumptions are provided below:
• The impact of a 50 basis point reduction in discount rate would cause scheme liabilities at 31 December 2017 to increase by 
approximately £123.0m. 
• The impact of a 10 basis point increase in inflation and salary inflation rates would cause scheme liabilities at 31 December 2017 to 
increase by approximately £17.0m.  
• The impact of assuming every scheme member were to live for an additional year would cause scheme liabilities at 31 December 2017 to 
increase by approximately £43.0m.
The above sensitivity analyses are based on a change in a single assumption while keeping all other assumptions constant. In practice, 
this is unlikely to occur, and changes in assumptions may be correlated. When calculating the sensitivity of the defined benefit obligation 
to significant actuarial assumptions, the same method of calculating the defined benefit obligation has been used as when calculating the 
retirement benefit obligations recognised on the balance sheet. The methods and types of assumptions used in preparing the sensitivity 
analysis are consistent with the previous year. No change has been considered necessary to any sensitivity levels, given recent past 
experience.
Risks
The Group is exposed to a number of risks arising from operating its defined benefit pension and healthcare schemes, the most significant 
of which are detailed below. The Group has not changed the process used to manage defined benefit scheme risks during the year unless 
otherwise stated. 
Asset volatility 
In determining the present value of schemes’ defined benefit obligations, liabilities are discounted using interest rates of high quality 
corporate bonds. To the extent the actual return on schemes’ assets is below this yield, the retirement benefit obligations recognised in the 
consolidated financial statements would increase. This risk is partly mitigated by funded schemes investing in matching corporate bonds, 
such that changes in asset values are offset by similar changes in the value of scheme liabilities. However, the Group also invests in other 
asset types such as equities, property, hedge funds, commodities and derivatives where movements in asset values may be uncorrelated 
to movements in the yields on high quality corporate bonds. The Group believes that, due to the long-term nature of its scheme liabilities, 
it is appropriate to invest in assets which are expected to outperform corporate bonds over this timeframe. Scheme assets are well 
diversified, such that the failure of any single investment would not have a material impact on the overall level of assets. Both the UK and 
US schemes have purchased equity derivatives which enable the schemes to benefit from equity-like returns, subject to certain caps, 
whilst providing an element of protection against falls in equity markets. These derivatives cover approximately 34% of the total equities 
held by the schemes and have an average remaining life of 2.3 years at 31 December 2017. The Group actively monitors how the duration 
and expected yield of scheme assets match the expected cash outflows arising from its pension obligations. For each UK and US funded 
scheme, there is a ‘glide-path’ in place which provides, to the extent the funding position improves, for asset volatility to be reduced by 
increased investment in long-term index linked securities with maturities that match the benefit payments as they fall due. 
Interest risk
In determining the present value of schemes’ defined benefit obligations, liabilities are discounted using interest rates of high quality 
corporate bonds. If these yields fall, the retirement benefit obligations recognised in the consolidated financial statements would increase. 
This risk is partly mitigated through the funded schemes investing in matching assets as described above. The Group currently does not 
use derivatives to mitigate this risk.
Inflation risk
In determining the present value of schemes’ defined benefit obligations, estimates are made as to the levels of salary inflation, increases in 
inflation that will apply to deferred benefits during deferment and pensions in payment, and healthcare cost inflation. To the extent actual 
inflation exceeds these estimates, the retirement benefit obligations recognised in the consolidated financial statements would increase. 
Salary inflation risk is partly mitigated in both the UK and US schemes by linking benefits in respect of future service to average salaries 
over a period of employment rather than final salary at retirement. Benefits in respect of certain periods of past service are still linked to 
final salary at retirement. In the UK, inflation risk in respect of deferred benefits and pensions in payment is mitigated by caps on the levels 
of inflation under the scheme rules. In the US and Switzerland, the schemes provide for no inflation to be applied to benefits in deferment or 
retirement. Exposure to inflation on US healthcare costs has been mitigated by freezing Group contributions to medical costs at 2011 cost 
levels. The Group currently does not use derivatives to mitigate this risk.
Longevity risk
In determining the present value of schemes’ defined benefit obligations, assumptions are made as to the life expectancy of members 
during employment and in retirement. To the extent life expectancy exceeds these estimates, the retirement benefit obligations recognised 
in the consolidated financial statements would increase. This risk is more significant in the UK plan, where inflationary increases result 
in higher sensitivity to changes in life expectancy. The Group currently does not use derivatives to mitigate this risk. During 2017, a lump 
sum offer was made to certain former employees of the US funded schemes and £11.4m was paid to settle those liabilities. Additionally, 
the Swiss scheme agreed changes to the rates at which benefits are payable. These two changes, which reduce the Group’s exposure to 
longevity risk in those schemes, resulted in a past service credit of £7.1m.  150 MEGGITT PLC

Other information 
In the UK, the 2015 triennial actuarial valuation was completed during 2016. At the date of the valuation, the deficit was measured for 
funding purposes at £249.4m. The buy-out valuation at the same date, which assumed the Group were to transfer responsibility of the 
scheme to an insurance company, was measured at £544.1m. The Group has no current plans to make such a transfer. The Group agreed 
with the trustees, following this valuation, to make annual deficit reduction payments commencing in 2016 with the aim of eliminating the 
deficit by 2024. Under this agreement, deficit payments in 2018 will be £29.1m and will increase by approximately 5% per annum until 
2024. The present value of future deficit payments agreed as part of the 2015 actuarial valuation exceeds the scheme accounting deficit at 
31 December 2017 by approximately £53.0m however, such amounts would be recoverable by the Group under the scheme rules once the 
last member has died and accordingly no additional minimum funding liability arises. 
In the US, deficit reduction payments are driven by regulations and provide for deficits to be eliminated over periods up to 15 years. Absent 
any changes in legislation, deficit payments in 2018 are expected to be £8.2m and to then increase over the following four years to an 
estimated £14.0m by 2022. Thereafter, annual payments are expected to remain relatively stable for the remainder of the recovery period. 
The present values of deficit payments due under legislation do not exceed the schemes’ deficits at 31 December 2017 and accordingly no 
additional minimum funding liability arises.
The Swiss scheme has a surplus on a funding basis of approximately £19.0m.
Estimated total Group contributions expected to be paid to the schemes during 2018 are £55.6m.
The weighted average duration of the UK schemes’ defined benefit obligation is 19.7 years. The weighted average duration of the overseas 
schemes’ defined benefit obligations is 12.2 years. The expected maturity of undiscounted pension and healthcare benefits at 31 December

37. Share-based payment 
The Group operates a number of share schemes for the benefit of its employees. The total expense recognised in the income statement in 
respect of such schemes is £8.0m (2016: £8.0m) (see note 9). The nature of each scheme which has a significant impact on the expense 
recognised is set out below. 
Meggitt Long Term Incentive Plan 2014: Equity-settled
Under the Meggitt Long Term Incentive Plan 2014, an annual award of shares may be made to certain senior executives. The number of 
shares, if any, that an executive ultimately receives, depends on three performance conditions:
• An earnings per share (EPS) measure (33% of the award); 
• A return on trading assets (ROTA) measure (33% of the award); and
• A strategic goals measure (33% of the award).
Each of the conditions is measured over a three-year performance period. An expense of £5.8m (2016: £5.4m) is recognised in the year. 
An employee is generally entitled to a payment at the end of the vesting period, equivalent to dividends that would have been paid during 
the vesting period, on any shares that vest. The fair value of the award made in 2017 has been estimated at the market price of the share on 
the date of grant, which was 442.10 pence (2016: 401.84 pence). Movements in the number of outstanding shares that may potentially be 
released to employees are as follows:

Deferred Share Bonus Plan: Equity-settled
Under the Deferred Share Bonus Plan, an award of shares may be made to certain senior executives. The number of shares, if any, that an 
executive ultimately receives, depends on the executive remaining in service for a specified period of time. There are no other significant 
performance conditions.
An expense of £0.7m (2016: £1.8m) is recognised in the year. An employee is generally entitled to a payment at the end of the vesting 
period, equivalent to dividends that would have been paid during the vesting period, on any shares that vest. The fair value of the awards 
made in 2017 has been estimated at the market price of the share on the date of grant. The average price at the date of grant was 480.00 
pence (2016: 350.00 pence). Movements in the number of outstanding shares that may potentially be released to employees are as

38. Own shares
Own shares represent shares in the Company that are held by an independently managed Employee Share Ownership Plan Trust (‘the 
trust’) formed to acquire shares to be used to satisfy share options and awards under the employee share schemes as described in the 
Directors’ remuneration report on pages 72 to 93. At 31 December 2017, the trust holds 4.2m ordinary shares (2016: 1.4m ordinary shares) 
of which 3.8m are unallocated (2016: 1.3m), being retained by the trust for future use. The balance is held for employees in a vested share 
account to satisfy particular awards which have fully vested. All shares, whether or not allocated, are held for the benefit of employees. 
The shares held at 31 December 2017 were purchased during 2015 and 2017 at a cost of £19.8m. The market value of the shares at 
31 December 2017 is £20.1m (2016: £6.5m) representing 0.54% of the issued share capital of the Company (2016: 0.18%).  152 MEGGITT PLC

Other financial commitments
The Group enters into long-term arrangements with aircraft and original equipment manufacturers to design, develop and supply 
products to them for the life of the aircraft. This represents a significant long-term financial commitment for the Group and requires the 
consideration of a number of uncertainties including the feasibility of the product and the ultimate commercial viability over a period 
which can extend over 40 years. The directors are satisfied that, at this time, there are no significant contingent liabilities arising from 
these commitments. Based on latest OE delivery forecasts from external agencies, the future estimated expenditure under contractual 
commitments to incur development costs and programme participation costs at 31 December 2017, which under the Group’s current 
accounting polices would be expected to be recognised as intangible assets when incurred, are shown below. Amounts are stated prior to

40. Contingent liabilities
The Company has given guarantees in respect of credit facilities for certain of its subsidiaries, some property leases, other leasing 
arrangements and the performance by some current and former subsidiaries of certain contracts. Also, there are similar guarantees given 
by certain other Group companies. The directors do not believe that the effect of giving these guarantees will have a material adverse effect 
upon the Group’s financial position. 
The Company and various of its subsidiaries are, from time to time, parties to legal proceedings and claims which arise in the ordinary 
course of business. The directors do not anticipate that the outcome of these proceedings, actions and claims, either individually or in 
aggregate, will have a material adverse effect upon the Group’s financial position.

43. Business combinations
On 28 March 2017, the Group acquired 100% of the equity in Elite Aerospace, Inc. (‘Elite’) for a consideration of USD 24.9m settled in cash. 
Elite is a provider of maintenance, repair and overhaul services for thermal management components. The acquisition increases the repair 
capabilities at the Group’s Miami hub and further enhances the foundations from which the Group will accelerate aftermarket growth over 
the medium term. Elite is reported within Meggitt Control Systems.
The provisional fair values of the assets and liabilities of Elite reflect changes made as necessary to align the accounting policies of the 
acquired business with those of the Group and to recognise intangible assets separately from goodwill. Goodwill is attributable to the 
profitability of the acquired business and expected future synergies arising following acquisition. The total amount of goodwill and other 
intangible assets acquired as part of the acquisition that is deductible for tax purposes is £17.8m. The fair value of acquired net assets and 
consideration has been recognised as follows:

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment is recorded at cost less accumulated 
depreciation and impairment losses. Cost includes expenditure 
directly attributable to the acquisition of the asset. 
Depreciation is charged on a straight-line basis over the estimated 
useful economic lives of the assets as follows:
Leasehold property Over period of lease
Plant and equipment 3 to 10 years
Motor vehicles 5 years
Residual values and useful lives are reviewed annually and adjusted 
if appropriate. When property, plant and equipment is disposed, 
the difference between sale proceeds, net of related costs, and the 
carrying value of the asset is recognised in the income statement.
Operating leases
Leases in which a significant portion of the risks and rewards of 
ownership are retained by the lessor are classified as operating 
leases. Payments made under operating leases, net of any 
incentives received from the lessor, are charged to the income 
statement on a straight-line basis over the period of the lease.
Taxation
Current tax is based on taxable profit for the period, calculated 
using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance 
sheet date.
Deferred tax is provided in full using the liability method on 
temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and 
liabilities and their corresponding book values as recorded in 
the Company’s financial statements. Deferred tax assets are 
recognised only to the extent it is probable that taxable profits will 
be available against which deductible temporary differences can 
be utilised. Deferred tax is calculated using tax rates enacted or 
substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Current tax and deferred tax are recognised in the income 
statement, other comprehensive income or directly in equity 
depending on where the item to which they relate has been 
recognised.
Foreign currencies
The Company’s financial statements are presented in pounds 
sterling. Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded at 
exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the transactions. 
Monetary assets and liabilities, denominated in foreign currencies 
are reported at exchange rates prevailing at the balance sheet 
date. Exchange differences on retranslating monetary assets and 
liabilities are recognised in the income statement. 
1. Basis of preparation
These financial statements have been prepared on a going concern 
basis and under the historical cost convention, as modified by 
the revaluation of certain financial assets and financial liabilities 
(including derivative financial instruments) at fair value, in 
accordance with the Companies Act 2006. 
The Company has taken advantage of the legal dispensation 
contained in Section 408 of the Companies Act 2006 allowing it not 
to publish a separate income statement and related notes and not 
to publish a separate statement of other comprehensive income.
The Company has prepared its financial statements in accordance 
with Financial Reporting Standard 101 ‘Reduced Disclosure 
Framework’ (FRS 101). In preparing these financial statements, the 
Company applies the recognition, measurement and disclosure 
requirements of International Financial Reporting Standards 
(‘IFRSs’) as adopted by the European Union, but has taken the 
following disclosure exemptions permitted by FRS 101:
• Paragraphs 45(b) and 46-52 of IFRS 2, ‘Share-based payment’;
• IFRS 7, ‘Financial Instruments: Disclosures’;
• Paragraphs 10(d) and 134-136 of IAS 1, ‘Presentation of financial 
statements’;
• IAS 7, ‘Statement of cash flows’;
• Paragraph 17 of IAS 24, ‘Related party disclosures’; and
• The requirements in IAS 24, ‘Related party disclosures’ to 
disclose related party transactions entered into between two or 
more members of a group.
2. Summary of significant accounting policies
The principal accounting policies adopted by the Company in the 
preparation of the financial statements are set out below. These 
policies have been applied consistently to all periods presented 
unless stated otherwise.
Investments
Investments in subsidiaries are stated at cost less accumulated 
impairment losses, except for investments acquired before 
1 January 1988 where Section 612 merger relief has been taken and 
investments are stated at the nominal value of the shares issued 
in consideration, using the deemed cost exemption in IFRS 1 on 
transition to FRS 101.
Intangible assets
Intangible assets, consisting of software, are recorded at cost less 
accumulated amortisation and impairment losses. Amortisation is 
charged on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful economic 
lives of the assets, typically over periods up to 5 years. Residual 
values and useful lives are reviewed annually and adjusted if 
appropriate.
Notes to the financial statements of the Company STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OTHER INFORMATION
Annual Report and Accounts 2017 MEGGITT PLC 161
Derivative financial instruments and hedging
Derivative financial instruments are initially recognised at fair 
value on the date the derivative contract is entered into and are 
subsequently measured at fair value at each balance sheet date 
using values determined indirectly from quoted prices that are 
observable for the asset or liability. 
The method by which any gain or loss arising from measurement 
at fair value is recognised, depends on whether the instrument 
is designated as a hedging instrument and if so the nature of the 
item hedged. The Company recognises an instrument as a hedging 
instrument by documenting, at its inception, the relationship 
between the instrument and the hedged item and the objectives and 
strategy for undertaking the hedging transaction. To be designated 
as a hedging instrument, an instrument must also be assessed, 
at inception and on an ongoing basis, to be highly effective in 
offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows of hedged items.
To the extent the maturity of the derivative financial instrument is 
more than 12 months from the balance sheet date, the fair value is 
reported as a non-current asset or non-current liability. All other 
derivative financial instruments are reported as current assets or 
current liabilities. 
Fair value hedges
Changes in fair value of derivative financial instruments, that are 
designated and qualify as fair value hedges, are recognised in the 
income statement together with changes in the fair value of the 
hedged item. The Company currently applies fair value hedge 
accounting to the hedging of fixed interest rate risk on bank and 
other borrowings.
Cash flow hedges
Changes in fair value of the effective portion of derivative financial 
instruments, that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges, 
are initially recognised in other comprehensive income. Changes 
in fair value of any ineffective portion are recognised immediately 
in the income statement. To the extent changes in fair value are 
recognised in other comprehensive income, they are recycled to the 
income statement in the periods in which the hedged item affects 
the income statement. The Company currently applies cash flow 
hedge accounting to the hedging of floating interest rate risk on 
certain loans due to subsidiary undertakings and bank and other 
borrowings. 
If the hedging instrument is sold or no longer meets the criteria 
for hedge accounting, the cumulative gain or loss previously 
recognised in other comprehensive income is transferred to the 
income statement.
2. Summary of significant accounting policies continued
Retirement benefit schemes
For defined benefit schemes, pension costs are charged to the 
income statement in accordance with the advice of qualified 
independent actuaries. Past service credits and costs and 
curtailment gains and losses are recognised immediately in the 
income statement.
Retirement benefit obligations represent the difference between the 
fair value of the scheme assets and the present value of the scheme 
defined benefit obligations measured at the balance sheet date. 
The defined benefit obligation is calculated annually by independent 
actuaries using the projected unit credit method. The present 
value of the defined benefit obligation is determined by discounting 
the defined benefit obligations using interest rates of high quality 
corporate bonds denominated in the currency in which the benefits 
will be paid and with terms to maturity comparable with the terms 
of the related defined benefit obligations. Where the Company 
has a statutory or contractual minimum funding requirement to 
make contributions to a scheme in respect of past service and any 
such contributions are not available to the Company once paid 
(as a reduction in future contributions or as a refund, to which the 
Company has an unconditional right either during the life of the 
scheme or when the scheme liabilities are settled), an additional 
liability for such amounts is recognised.
Remeasurement gains and losses are recognised in the period in 
which they arise in other comprehensive income. 
For defined contribution schemes, payments are recognised in the 
income statement when they fall due. The Company has no further 
obligations once the contributions have been paid.
Share-based compensation
Awards made to employees of the Company are equity settled. 
The fair value of an award is measured at the date of grant and 
reflects any market-based vesting conditions. At the date of grant, 
the Company estimates the number of awards expected to vest as 
a result of non market-based vesting conditions and the fair value 
of this estimated number of awards is recognised as an expense 
in the income statement on a straight-line basis over the period 
for which services are provided. At each balance sheet date, the 
Company revises its estimate of the number of awards expected to 
vest as a result of non market-based vesting conditions and adjusts 
the amount recognised cumulatively in the income statement to 
reflect the revised estimate. When awards are exercised and the 
Company issues new shares, the proceeds received, net of any 
directly attributable transaction costs, are credited to share capital 
(nominal value) and share premium.
The grant by the Company of options over its equity instruments 
to employees of subsidiary undertakings, is treated as a capital 
contribution. The fair value of the awards made is recognised, 
over the vesting period, as an increase in investment in subsidiary 
undertakings, with a corresponding credit to retained earnings. 162 MEGGITT PLC

2. Summary of significant accounting policies continued
Derivatives not meeting the criteria for hedge accounting
Where derivatives do not meet the criteria for hedge accounting, 
changes in fair value are recognised immediately in the income 
statement. The Company utilises a large number of foreign 
currency forward contracts to mitigate against currency 
fluctuations. The Company has determined that the additional costs 
of meeting the extensive documentation requirements in order 
to apply hedge accounting under IAS 39 ‘Financial Instruments: 
Recognition and Measurement’ are not merited. 
Borrowings
Borrowings are initially recognised at fair value, being proceeds 
received less directly attributable transaction costs incurred. 
Borrowings are generally subsequently measured at amortised cost 
at each balance sheet date with any transaction costs amortised 
to the income statement over the period of the borrowings using 
the effective interest method. Certain borrowings however are 
designated as fair value through profit and loss at inception, where 
the Company has interest rate derivatives in place which have the 
economic effect of converting fixed rate borrowings into floating 
rate borrowings. Such borrowings are measured at fair value at 
each balance sheet date with any movement in fair value recorded 
in the income statement. 
Any related interest accruals are included within borrowings. 
Borrowings are classified as current liabilities unless the Company 
has an unconditional right to defer settlement of the liability for at 
least 12 months after the balance sheet date.
Share capital 
Ordinary shares are classified as equity. Incremental costs directly 
attributable to the issue of new shares are deducted from the 
proceeds recorded in equity. 
Own shares represent shares in the Company that are held by 
an independently managed Employee Share Ownership Plan. 
Consideration paid for own shares, including any incremental 
directly attributable costs, is recorded as a deduction from retained 
earnings. Details of own shares in the Company are disclosed in 
note 38 to the Group consolidated financial statements.
Dividends
Interim dividends are recognised as liabilities when they are 
approved by the Board. Final dividends are recognised as liabilities 
when they are approved by the shareholders. Details of dividends 
paid and proposed by the Company are disclosed in note 16 to the 
Group consolidated financial statements.
3. Critical accounting estimates and judgements
In applying the Company’s accounting policies set out in note 2, the 
Company is required to make certain estimates and judgements 
concerning the future. These estimates and judgements are 
regularly reviewed and revised as necessary. 
The estimates and assumptions that have the most significant 
effect on the amounts included in these financial statements are 
described below. There are no judgements considered to be critical 
relating to the year.
Critical accounting estimates and assumptions
Investment in subsidiaries
At least annually, the Company assesses the carrying value of its 
investments in subsidiaries, which requires estimates to be made 
of the value in use of each entity. These value in use calculations 
are dependent on estimates of future cash flows, long-term growth 
rates and appropriate discount rates to be applied to future cash 
flows. No reasonably foreseeable change in assumptions would 
cause a significant impairment to be recognised.
Retirement benefit obligations
The liability recognised in respect of retirement benefit obligations 
is dependent on a number of estimates including those relating to 
mortality, inflation, salary increases and the rate at which liabilities 
are discounted. External actuarial advice is taken with regard to 
the most appropriate assumptions to use. Further details on these 
estimates, and sensitivities of the retirement benefit obligations to 
these estimates, are disclosed in note 12.

*  Present value of scheme liabilities.

Details on the sensitivity of scheme liabilities to changes in assumptions are provided below: 
• The impact of a 50 basis point reduction in discount rate would cause scheme liabilities at 31 December 2017 to increase by 
approximately £92.0m. 
• The impact of a 10 basis point increase in inflation and salary inflation rates would cause scheme liabilities at 31 December 2017 to 
increase by approximately £16.0m. 
• The impact of assuming every scheme member were to live for an additional year would cause scheme liabilities at 31 December 2017 to 
increase by approximately £28.0m.
The above sensitivity analyses are based on a change in a single assumption while keeping all other assumptions constant. In practice, 
this is unlikely to occur, and changes in assumptions may be correlated. When calculating the sensitivity of the defined benefit obligation 
to significant actuarial assumptions, the same method of calculating the defined benefit obligation has been used as when calculating the 
retirement benefit obligations recognised on the balance sheet. The methods and types of assumptions used in preparing the sensitivity 
analysis are consistent with the previous year. No change has been considered necessary to sensitivity levels, given recent past experience.
The weighted average duration of the UK scheme defined benefit obligation is 19.7 years.

Forward-looking statements 
The Annual Report and Accounts contains certain 
forward-looking statements with regard to the 
operations, performance and financial condition of the 
g roup. By their nature, these statements involve 
uncertainty since future events and circumstances can 
cause results to differ materially from those anticipated. 
The forward-looking statements reflect knowledge and 
information available at the date of preparation of this 
Annual Report and Accounts and the Company 
undertakes no obligation to update these forward-
looking statements. n othing contained in this Annual 
Report and Accounts should be construed as a profit 
forecast. This report is intended to provide information 
to shareholders, is not designed to be relied upon by any 
other party or for any other purpose, and the Company 
and its directors accept no liability to any other person 
other than that required under English law.
TO FLY
Expertise relied upon by 
customers to enable safe and 
cost effective flight
We balance weight, life span, life-cycle cost, dispatchability, ease of maintenance, short field 
performance and turnaround times to deliver the optimal combination of technical performance and 
operating economics needed for a given aircraft. With decades of experience, an extensive intellectual 
property portfolio and positions on some of the world’s most technologically advanced civil and military 
aircraft, Meggitt plays a critical role in enabling safe and cost effective landings for over 15 million flights 
each year.
TO POWER
Products and services which  
enable customers to reliably 
operate critical infrastructure 
without disruption
Meggitt health monitoring systems are installed on energy infrastructure across the globe, including the 
world’s tallest gravity dam at g rand Dixence, Switzerland. Highly durable sensors placed close to critical 
pieces of equipment relay information on everything from vibration anomalies to electrical currents back 
to a central computer system. By inspecting patterns within the signals, analysts can easily see if their 
equipment is in peak condition or in need of maintenance. Because any potential problems show up early 
on, engineers can schedule physical inspections and repairs for optimal times, when energy demand is 
low. Most important, health monitoring avoids catastrophic failures, potentially saving billions of pounds.
TO LIVE
Innovative technologies which  
make the world more secure
Meggitt is the leading provider of fuel tanks to the US military. Before our crashworthy fuel tanks, over 
42% of survivable helicopter crashes in the US resulted in deaths from fuel fires. Today, Meggitt’s 
crashworthy, self-seal fuel tanks, which meet rigorous standards for flexibility, strength, impact and cut-
and-tear resistance have stopped fuel spillage and reduced fire-related death and injury in such crashes 
to almost zero. If punctured by a high impact explosive 23mm bullet, Meggitt’s ballistically-resistant fuel 
bladders will self-seal in less than two minutes. The wound is encased in a rubber gel, which suppresses 
the ignition source, stops fuel leakage and enables flight crews to return safely to their home base.
