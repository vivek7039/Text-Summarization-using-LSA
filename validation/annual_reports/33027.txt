world today. As a global biopharmaceutical company, AstraZeneca 
has a key contribution to make by providing innovative medicines 
for some of the world’s most serious diseases. 
We know that if we are to deliver medicines that people really need and value, we cannot  
do it in isolation. We work closely with all our stakeholders to understand their needs and 
challenges. We are committed to acting with integrity and high ethical standards in everything 
we do and our goal is always to improve health for patients and bring benefit for our 
stakeholders, our business and society.

Statements of competitive position, growth rates and sales
In this Annual Report, except as otherwise stated, market information regarding the 
position of our business or products relative to its or their competition is based upon 
published statistical sales data for the 12 months ended 30 September 2011 obtained

For the US, dispensed new or total prescription data and audited sales data are 
taken, respectively, from IMS Health National Prescription Audit and IMS National 
Sales Perspectives for the 12 months ended 31 December 2011; such data is not 
adjusted for Medicaid and similar state rebates. Except as otherwise stated, these 
market share and industry data from IMS Health have been derived by comparing our 
sales revenue to competitors’ and total market sales revenues for that period. Except 
as otherwise stated, growth rates are given at CER. For the purposes of this Annual 
Report, unless otherwise stated, references to the world pharmaceutical market or 
similar phrases are to the 53 countries contained in the IMS Health MIDAS Quantum 
database, which amounted to approximately 96% (in value) of the countries audited

Dear Shareholder
I write to you at the end of a year in which research- 
based pharmaceutical companies faced a tough 
marketplace and operating environment. Against this 
challenging background, disciplined execution of our 
strategy delivered a good performance. Our strong cash 
flow supported a significant increase in cash distributions 
to shareholders and continued investment to drive future 
growth and value. These conditions also provided the 
backdrop to the annual review by your Board of our 
business strategy – which remains to be a focused, 
integrated, innovation-driven, global, prescription- 
based biopharmaceutical business. I would like to take this opportunity to review AstraZeneca’s financial 
performance in 2011 and the decisions we took to ensure we continue 
to deliver sustainable value for you.
Financial performance
Group sales in 2011 were down 2% at CER to $33,591 million  
(2010: $33,269 million) and reported operating profit was up 10%  
at $12,795 million (2010: $11,494 million), which included the gain  
on the sale of Astra Tech. Performance for the year reflected strong 
double digit sales growth for Crestor, Seroquel XR and Symbicort.
It was also impacted by government pricing interventions and generic 
competition, which combined to reduce revenue by some $3 billion. 
Revenue in the US was down 2%, as was revenue in markets outside 
the US: revenue was down 11% in Western Europe, up 4% in 
Established ROW and up 10% in Emerging Markets. 
Reported earnings per share for the full year were up 29% at  
$7.33 (2010: $5.60), which also included the non-taxable gain  
of $1.08 from the Astra Tech sale. Our effective tax rate also  
benefited from an adjustment in respect of prior periods following  
the announcement in March 2011 that HM Revenue & Customs in the 
UK and the US Internal Revenue Service had agreed the terms of an 
Advance Pricing Agreement regarding transfer pricing arrangements 
for AstraZeneca’s US business.
A challenging marketplace
The world pharmaceutical market grew by 4.5% in 2011 and the 
fundamentals of the industry remain strong. First, the world population 
continues to increase and age: it passed the seven billion mark in 
2011, while the number of people over 65 in 2030 is estimated to be 
almost one billion, double the 2005 figure. Secondly, we are seeing 
the emergence of expanding numbers of patients in new markets  
who can access our medicines for the first time. Thirdly, there remains 
considerable unmet medical need. Chronic diseases are on the 
increase, not only in wealthy countries but also in middle income and, 
increasingly, lower income countries. For example, some 346 million 
people around the world have diabetes while 24 million are affected  
by Alzheimer’s Disease. Finally, advances in science and technology 
promise the continued delivery of new medicines that can make a real 
difference to patient health.
Yet, while the fundamentals remain strong, the challenges facing the 
industry have been unprecedented in recent years. Patents on some 
of the world’s most successful innovative medicines are starting to 
expire and we face increasing competition from generic alternatives. 
Additionally, the need to improve R&D productivity and the number of 
product launches remains a critical challenge for the whole sector. 
Around the world, rising healthcare costs, coupled with the difficult 
economic climate and continued austerity measures being 
implemented by governments, have resulted in pressure on prices. 
This includes pricing interventions in many countries. The regulatory 
landscape is changing, becoming more global and more complex.  
It is no longer enough for new medicines to be safe and effective. 
Health authorities increasingly require additional information regarding 
a medicine’s comparative clinical and cost effectiveness.
Our strategic response
It was with these challenges in mind that your Board undertook its 
strategy review process in 2011. We are confident that long-term 
growth in demand for innovative biopharmaceuticals will remain 
strong. We believe there continue to be opportunities to create  
value for those who invest in pharmaceutical innovation, and that 
AstraZeneca has the skills and capabilities to take advantage of these 
opportunities and turn them into long-term value through the research, 
development and marketing of our medicines. We also recognise that 
the industry is going through a period of fundamental change as it 
seeks to overcome the serious challenges we face. 
For us, that means a continued focus on ensuring we drive:
> world class productivity in R&D
> increased external collaboration
> a global orientation, reflecting the growth in Emerging Markets
> stronger customer orientation, particularly towards payers
> operational efficiency with a flexible cost base.
Our 2011 review highlighted the ongoing need for a substantial 
improvement in R&D productivity if we are to sustain acceptable 
returns to shareholders. We are therefore planning to accelerate our 
R&D strategy. We intend to take a new approach to Neuroscience, 
closing our existing research centres and creating a new virtual 
innovative medicines unit for our R&D in this challenging field.  
We also plan to reshape our other R&D global functions to better 
support a more focused portfolio and create a simpler organisation 
with greater flexibility in all functional areas. 
In his Chief Executive Officer’s Review on the following pages, David 
Brennan outlines the steps we took in 2011 to secure our future 
business success. David also emphasises that how we do business 
is as important as what we do. We need to continue to work with 
integrity and to high ethical standards if we are to deliver on our 
promise of bringing benefits to patients, creating sustainable value  
for shareholders and contributing to economic and social welfare.  
In this regard, the Board has an important role to play in setting high 
standards and monitoring performance.
Outlook
We continue to plan on the basis that revenue will be in the range  
of $28-34 billion a year over the 2010-14 period, as revenue growth 
from key franchises that retain exclusivity and continued growth in 
Emerging Markets are pressured by the loss of market exclusivity on 
a number of products. However, based on the evolution of the base 
case assumptions since 2010, such as the downward pressure on 
revenue from government interventions, revenue for the remainder 
of the period is likely to be in the lower half of the range.
Returns to shareholders
In recognition of the Group’s strong balance sheet and sustainable 
significant cash flow, and the Board’s confidence in the strategic 
direction and long-term prospects for the business, we announced, 
in conjunction with the full year 2009 results, the adoption of a 
progressive dividend policy, intending to maintain or grow the  
dividend each year. After providing for business investment, funding 
the progressive dividend policy and meeting our debt service 
obligations, the Board will also keep under review the opportunity  
to return cash in excess of these requirements to shareholders 
through periodic share repurchases.
The Board has recommended a second interim dividend of $1.95,  
a 5% increase over the second interim dividend awarded in 2010.  
This brings the dividend for the full year to $2.80 (175.5 pence, SEK 
18.54), an increase of 10% from 2010. In 2011, cash distributions to 
shareholders through dividends totalled $3,764 million and net share 
repurchases totalled $5,606 million.
Appreciation
In the face of intensified pressures we delivered a good performance 
in 2011 and took difficult decisions to ensure the future success  
of AstraZeneca. None of this would have been possible without  
the leadership of David Brennan and the other members of his 
executive team. My thanks, and those of the whole Board, go to 
them and all our employees for their effort in working to deliver on 
our promise.

AstraZeneca Annual Report and Form 20-F Information 2011 8 Chief Executive Officer’s Review
AstraZeneca has a proud tradition of 
developing great medicines that make  
a meaningful difference to patient health. 
Looking ahead, we remain committed to 
developing innovative and valued medicines 
that improve the health of people around  
the world, benefit society and provide an 
acceptable return for our shareholders. 
In my review I want to outline some of the 
steps we took and decisions we made in 
2011 to secure our future business success.

A trusted partner
We cannot secure our success if we do not have good relationships 
with those with whom we do business. Trust is critical to achieving 
this: we need to connect with our stakeholders, including patients, 
physicians, regulators, governments and payers, if we are to 
understand their needs and challenges. We also need to earn and 
maintain the trust of our customers, partners and other stakeholders. 
This requires us to do things in the right way and to behave in 
accordance with our core values. 
That is why I set such store by our Global External Interactions Policy, 
launched in April 2011, which provides a single, common, principle-
based approach to all our interactions worldwide with public officials, 
healthcare professionals and community organisations. The introduction 
of the policy drove changes in the way we market and sell our products 
and I believe we now lead the industry in this area of business.
Our commitment to acting responsibly and the sustainable 
development of our Group was further reinforced in 2011 by the 
publication of our new Responsible Business Plan, which is closely 
aligned to our business strategy and its priorities.
The growing importance of compliance and ethics to our reputation 
and business operations was demonstrated during the year by the 
appointment of Katarina Ageborg, our new Chief Compliance Officer, 
to the SET.
World class Research and Development
At the core of our strategy to be a focused, integrated, innovation-
driven, global, prescription-based biopharmaceutical business is  
the need to have an R&D function with world class productivity. In his 
Chairman’s Statement on page 6, Louis Schweitzer outlined how we 
are redoubling our efforts to deliver this through the use of innovative 
and collaborative ways of working. Our focus is on ensuring more 
effective and efficient delivery of our research objectives across our 
therapeutic portfolio. 
Our results in 2011 were mixed. We were pleased by the FDA’s 
approval in July of Brilinta, our treatment for acute coronary 
syndromes. Brilinta, or Brilique, its trade name in Europe, is now 
approved in 64 countries, launched in 37 and under review in a further 
39. Also on a positive note, Caprelsa (vandetanib), for the treatment of 
thyroid cancer, has been launched in the US and received a positive 
CHMP opinion in the EU. Axanum, for the prevention of cardiovascular 
events, Komboglyze
TM
, for diabetes, and Fluenz, our influenza vaccine, 
were also approved in the EU. In Japan, both Nexium and Faslodex 
were launched following approvals earlier in the year.
During 2011, two of the Phase III trials for TC-5214, our neuroscience 
collaboration with Targacept, did not meet their primary endpoint.  
In December, we also announced that our investigational compound 
olaparib (AZD2281) for the treatment of ovarian cancer will not 
progress into Phase III. As a result of these two events we recorded  
an impairment charge of $435 million.
We were also disappointed during the year by the withdrawal of 
zibotentan (for prostate cancer). Axanum was also withdrawn in the 
US. In January 2012, we received a Complete Response Letter from 
the FDA for our submission for dapagliflozin. We, together with BMS, 
remain committed to this treatment for diabetes and will work closely 
with the FDA to provide additional clinical data.
Increased collaboration
Our focus on developing in-house capabilities is matched by our 
desire to develop a more outward-looking organisation committed to 
accessing the best science, regardless of its origin. Indeed, six of our 
nine projects in Phase III/Registration and 12 out of 24 in Phase II were 
sourced externally. 
During 2011, we completed a number of transactions to strengthen 
our long-term development. These included the in-licensing of 
tremelimumab from Pfizer, and our groundbreaking collaboration  
with the UK Medical Research Council providing academic 
researchers with access to over 20 AstraZeneca compounds.  
Our plans for R&D will see us build further on this collaborative  
way of working.
Global orientation
Our future success requires us to develop global strategies to 
commercialise our products effectively. These need to be tailored  
to local needs in both mature and emerging markets. 
As part of that drive, we announced our decision to invest $200 million 
in a manufacturing facility in China and our agreement to acquire a 
Chinese company that will give us access to a portfolio of medicines 
used to treat infections. In Russia, we invested $150 million in a 
manufacturing plant and announced plans to establish a new 
predictive science centre.
We are also committed to playing our part in the global challenge  
of providing sustainable access to healthcare for all those who need  
it. Our strategy recognises the complexities surrounding the issue 
which range from the affordability of medicines to the availability of 
healthcare systems and the resources to make them effective. 
Stronger customer orientation
As the Chairman noted, there is no let up in sight on the downward 
pressure we face on the price of medicines. More than ever, we need 
to demonstrate their value to those who buy them. Our collaborations 
with HealthCore and IMS will help us undertake ‘real world’ studies to 
understand how to treat disease most effectively and economically. 
We also need to undertake more studies such as the Brilinta PLATO 
study demonstrating that, even at a higher price, it is a more cost 
effective treatment than the generic alternative.
Equally, we need to recognise the changing shape of healthcare 
systems. Those who work in them are working more intensively and 
with less time to research medicines. We are therefore piloting new 
ways of working to meet their needs. These include the use of digital 
channels which offer information that is available when it is needed, 
and without having to leave the office.
Operational efficiency
Our continued drive for operational efficiency is typified by the  
design and construction of our new plant in China, which is using 
‘Lean’ production principles from the outset. We are also streamlining 
processes and moving to a more flexible cost base in order to  
remain competitive.
As we reshape our business to meet the needs of our customers 
efficiently, we are seeing reductions in the workforce across much of 
our organisation, particularly in our mature Established Markets and in 
our R&D organisation. This reshaping includes plans for further R&D 
site consolidation. These are difficult decisions as they go to the heart 
of AstraZeneca, our people. Where possible, we seek to redeploy staff 
or assist with outplacement and, together with my colleagues, I remain 
committed to managing these changes in the right way, in accordance 
with local employment laws, our standards and core values.
A confident future
Our industry is undergoing a period of fundamental change. If we are 
to be one of the winners in the sector we need to make the necessary 
changes both to what we do and how we do it. I am confident that 
within AstraZeneca we have people with the skills to do that and pay 
tribute to their continued efforts in 2011 to ensure we deliver on our 
commitments to patients, society and our shareholders. I look forward 
to working with them to build on those efforts in 2012.

Overview
AstraZeneca Annual Report and Form 20-F Information 2011 Chief Executive Officer’s Review 9 Overview
Life-cycle of a medicine
Phase I studies
 
Studies designed to understand how the 
potential medicine is absorbed in the body, 
distributed around it and excreted; also 
determine an appropriate dosage and identify 
side effects. These typically take place in small 
groups of healthy human volunteers or, in 
certain cases, patients.
Confirm the most appropriate formulation and 
begin to develop manufacturing route to ensure 
the manufacturing process is robust and costs 
are minimised.
May involve external clinicians and organisations 
in the design and running of these studies.
Regulatory 
submission and 
pricing
 
Seek approval from regulatory 
authorities to manufacture, market 
and sell the medicine.
Submit package of clinical data  
which demonstrates the safety  
profile and efficacy of the medicine  
to regulatory authorities.
Regulatory authorities decide whether 
to grant marketing authorisation 
based on the medicine’s safety 
profile, effectiveness and quality.
Large numbers of national, regional 
and local payers grant approval for 
the pricing and/or reimbursement  
of the medicine.
Phase III studies
 
Studies, typically in large groups  
of patients, designed to gather 
information about effectiveness and 
safety of the medicine and evaluate 
the overall benefit/risk profile in  
the specific disease and patient 
segments in which the medicine  
will be used.
Create appropriate branding for  
the new medicine in preparation  
for launch.
Phase II studies
 
Studies designed to evaluate 
effectiveness of the medicine, typically 
using small groups of patients.
During Phase II studies, design a 
Phase III programme to deliver data 
required for regulatory approval and 
pricing and/or reimbursement 
throughout the world.
External advisory panels help define 
the attributes to test in studies to 
demonstrate whether the potential 
new medicine can be differentiated 
from the existing standard treatment  
of care.
Preclinical studies
 
Undertake studies in the laboratory 
and in animals to understand if the 
potential medicine should be safe to 
introduce into humans and in what 
quantities.
Determine likely efficacy, side effect 
profile and maximum tolerable dose 
estimate in humans.
Regulatory authorities are informed  
of proposed trials which are then 
conducted within the framework of 
the relevant regulations.
Find potential 
medicine
 
Identify the unmet medical need  
and market opportunity. Undertake 
laboratory research to find a potential 
medicine that should be potent, 
selective and absorbed into and  
well tolerated by the body.
Begin the process of seeking patent 
protection for the potential medicine.
Collaborate with academia and 
external clinicians to access the best 
external science and medical opinion.

in larger populations.
Sponsors and regulatory authorities monitor the safety of 
medicines post-approval and update prescribing information  
as necessary.
Includes ‘life-cycle management’ activities to broaden 
understanding of the medicine’s full potential. 
Work with external advisory groups and regulatory authorities to 
consider potential additional diseases which might be treated by 
the medicine or better ways of administering the medicine.
Submit data packages with requests for line extensions. 
Regulatory authorities review the data to assess the benefits and 
risks of using the medicine in the new disease or population and 
issue a decision.
Patent expiry  
and generic entry
 
Typically, when patents protecting the 
medicine expire, generic versions of 
the medicine may enter the market.
Launch new medicine
 
Raise awareness of patient benefit and appropriate use.
Market and sell medicine; continuously monitor, record and 
analyse reported side effects; review need to update the side 
effect warnings to ensure that patients’ wellbeing is maintained.
Clinicians begin to prescribe medicine and patients begin  
to benefit.
The process of getting a drug to market, from initial discovery, 
through development to approval and launch is risky, costly and 
time consuming. This is a high level overview of the process.  
It is illustrative only. It is not intended to, nor does it, represent  
the life-cycle of any particular medicine or of every medicine 
discovered and/or developed by AstraZeneca nor of the  
probability of success or approval of any AstraZeneca medicine.

AstraZeneca Annual Report and Form 20-F Information 2011 14 Health Innovation Our Strategy and Performance
More people than ever before had access to innovative medicines in 2011. At the same time, the 
pharmaceutical industry is facing the expiry of patents on some of the world’s most successful 
medicines, is experiencing pressure on R&D returns and is increasingly being challenged to prove 
the value of its drugs. In this section, we describe the key growth drivers and challenges that we 
face. We then describe AstraZeneca’s response, strategy and business model for creating value, 
through which we deliver benefits to our stakeholders. Finally, we outline the indicators that we use 
to measure our delivery against our objectives. 
As the figure overleaf shows, the world pharmaceutical market grew  
by 4.5% in 2011. Average revenue growth in Established Markets was 
2.8% while that in Emerging Markets was over four times higher at 
12%. The top five pharmaceutical markets in the world remained the 
US, Japan, Germany, France and China, with the US representing 
38.1% of global prescription pharmaceutical sales (2010: 38.5%). 
While demand for medicines and world pharmaceutical markets 
continued to grow in 2011, research-based pharmaceutical companies 
faced a challenging marketplace. Industry returns are under pressure 
from declining R&D productivity and intensifying pricing pressures, 
particularly in Established Markets facing rising healthcare costs. We 
also face increased competition from generic medicines as some of 
the world’s most successful drugs come off patent. In addition, greater 
regulatory constraints are being placed on the pharmaceutical industry 
by governments and those who pay for our medicines. 
The industry remains highly competitive. Our competitors are other 
large research-based pharmaceutical companies that develop  
and sell innovative, patent-protected prescription medicines and 
vaccines, as well as smaller biotechnology and vaccine companies, 
and companies that produce generic medicines. While many of our 
peers are confronting similar challenges, strategically these challenges 
are being met in different ways. For example, some companies  
have chosen to diversify by acquiring or building branded generics 
businesses or consumer portfolios, arguing that this enables them to 
better meet changing customer needs and smooth risk for shareholders. 
Most companies continued to pursue their existing strategies in  
2011, with some continuing to diversify and others pursuing a  
focused strategy. There were, however, exceptions with examples  
of companies shedding diversified assets. Key trends included  
efforts to improve R&D productivity, expansion of geographic scope, 
especially in Emerging Markets and Japan, and the pursuit of 
operational efficiency. Industry consolidation continued with both 
merger activity and acquisitions of specific assets and capabilities. 
The pharmaceutical industry
Growth drivers
Expanding patient populations 
The world population is estimated to have passed seven billion in 
2011, increasing from six billion in 1998, and is expected to reach  
nine billion by 2050. In addition, the number of people who can 
access healthcare continues to increase, particularly among the 
elderly. Globally, it is estimated that the number of people over 65  
will be almost one billion by 2030, double what it was in 2005.
Faster-developing economies, such as China, India and Brazil,  
offer new opportunities for the pharmaceutical industry to help an 
expanding number of patients who can benefit from innovative 
medicines. Emerging Markets now represent approximately 85% of 
the world population. In addition, pharmaceutical revenues in those 
markets grew significantly faster than those in Established Markets in 
2011 and, as the Estimated pharmaceutical market growth 2010-2015 
figure overleaf shows, it is estimated that this trend will continue.
Unmet medical need 
In most established markets, ageing populations and certain  
lifestyle choices such as smoking, a poor diet and lack of exercise 
drive an increased incidence of chronic diseases such as cancer, 
cardiovascular/metabolic and respiratory diseases which require 
long-term management. The prevalence of chronic disease is 
increasing in middle income countries and is also beginning to have  
an impact in low income countries. For example, there are 36 million 
deaths every year from non-communicable diseases and, of those, 
80% are in lower and middle income countries. It is estimated that 
nearly 33% of the world’s diabetes patients will come from India and 
China by 2030, by which date its prevalence in Brazil is expected to 
have increased by two-thirds.

Strategy and Performance
Advances in science and technology 
Innovation leading to new drugs is critical to meeting unmet medical 
need. Existing drugs will continue to be important in meeting the 
growing demand for healthcare, particularly with the increasing  
use of generic medication. At the same time, advances in disease 
understanding and the application of new technologies will be 
required to ensure the delivery of new medicines. Such approaches 
include personalised healthcare and predictive science as well as  
new types of therapy. 
With advances in the technologies for the design and testing of novel 
compounds, new opportunities exist for the use of innovative small 
molecules as new medicines. The use of large molecules, or biologics, 
has also become an important source of innovation, with biologics 
among the most commercially successful new products. Forecasts  
for 2016 predict that of the world’s top 100 pharmaceutical products, 
45% of sales will come from biologics. This compares with only 33% 
in 2010 and 15% in 2002. Most pharmaceutical companies now 
pursue both small molecules and biologics R&D.
The challenges
R&D productivity 
Improving R&D productivity is a critical challenge for the 
pharmaceutical industry. Global investment in pharmaceutical R&D  
by the top 500 pharmaceutical and biotech companies reached an 
estimated $133 billion in 2011, a 93% increase from $69 billion in 
2002. Over the same period, the number of new drug launches per 
year in the US stayed broadly the same, with an annual average of 25. 
Increasing investment has not yet resulted in a sustained increase in 
output, although the FDA approved 30 new drugs in 2011. At the 
same time, there appears to be a shift away from regulatory 
submissions for broad primary care medicines to more specialist 
drugs treating, for example, more complex diseases, together with 
orphan drugs for rare medical conditions.
To ensure it delivers a sustainable return on its R&D investment, the 
industry is working to increase its probability of success in developing 
commercially viable new drugs and moving to a lower, more flexible 
cost base. It does so at a time when regulators and payers are 
demanding more and better evidence of comparative effectiveness  
of compounds, which lengthens development times and increases 
development costs. 
AstraZeneca Annual Report and Form 20-F Information 2011 16 Strategy and Performance The pharmaceutical industry Using the full range of innovative technologies, the industry is focused 
on two critical milestones: Proof of Concept, which delivers candidate 
drugs with supporting data demonstrating that the drug results in a 
clinical change with an acceptable endpoint or surrogate in patients 
with the disease, and, secondly, product approval.
Organisationally, companies are addressing productivity challenges  
in a variety of ways. These include:
>  focusing on a defined set of therapeutic areas, and exiting those 
where success has been poor 
>  restructuring R&D organisations to create clearer accountabilities 
and smaller, more entrepreneurial units
>  revamping decision making and governance, so that unsuccessful 
compounds are identified early, before significant costs have  
been incurred 
>  reducing costs and improving process efficiency, using Lean 
business improvement tools such as Six Sigma and outsourcing 
>  a collaboration-centric business model that includes academic 
collaborations and co-development agreements that provide for  
the sharing of development risks and costs with third parties
>  looking externally for high quality science, technologies, targets, 
drug candidates, and/or entire drug pipelines.
Regulatory requirements 
Our industry continues to be one of the most heavily regulated.  
This reflects public interest in ensuring access to safe, effective and 
high quality medicines that are responsibly promoted. Given the 
nature and geographic scope of our business, we maintain important 
relationships with health authorities worldwide, including the FDA in 
the US, the EMA in the EU, the Japan Pharmaceuticals and Medical 
Device Agency and the SFDA in China.

Efforts to harmonise regulations globally are ongoing, yet the  
number of regulations and their impact continue to multiply. This is 
particularly evident in the conduct of clinical trials. In order to support 
the registration of our products in a given regulatory jurisdiction, 
programmes providing foreign clinical trial data must meet each 
individual health authority’s requirements to ensure relevance to their 
population. Regulators also continue to redefine their patient safety 
assessment processes. This includes the management of known  
and emerging risks, both before and after product approval. In certain 
markets, additional safety initiatives are developing locally which 
operate independently of already established international standards, 
further increasing the complexity and disharmony of drug safety 
monitoring and reporting. In addition, the growing complexity and 
globalisation, of both clinical studies and the manufacturing supply 
chain, has led to an increase in cross-regional health authority 
collaborations and inspections in these areas. 
Public demand for access to data, especially clinical data, to 
understand how health authorities arrive at their regulatory decisions, 
has resulted in numerous transparency proposals worldwide. In some 
instances, policies have been implemented without guidelines that 
define personal, private and proprietary information. Thus there  
can be no assurance that the data will be safeguarded against  
public disclosure.
There is mounting pressure from both health technology assessors 
and payers to assess not only the safety of our products but also  
their relative effectiveness and value. Consequently there is a 
heightened interest by health authorities in both the comparative 
clinical effectiveness and the ongoing benefit/risk assessment  
of pharmaceuticals after approval. The regulatory landscape is 
evolving with an increased focus on incorporating validated health 
outcome quality measures into clinical trials and developing clinical 
comparative evidence.

the pharmaceutical industry for further cost savings in much the same 
way that they did during deficit reduction discussions.
More information regarding the impact of price controls and 
reductions, as well as the impact of healthcare reform in the US, can 
be found in the Principal risks and uncertainties section from page 
130. The principal aspects of price regulation in our major markets  
are described further in the Geographical Review from page 77.
Patent expiries and genericisation 
Over the next few years some of the biggest selling drugs the industry 
has ever produced face patent expiry. As a consequence, payers, 
physicians and patients in Established Markets will have low price, 
generic alternatives in many important classes of primary care drugs. 
For example, in the US, generics constitute 80% of the market by 
volume today and are expected to be the single largest driver of value 
growth up to 2015. 
Patents only protect pharmaceutical products for a finite period and 
the expiry or early loss of patents may lead to the availability of 
generics. Generic versions of drugs are very competitive with 
significantly lower pricing than the innovator equivalents. This is partly 
due to lower investment by generic manufacturers in R&D and market 
development which generic manufacturers do not need to recover. 
While generic competition has traditionally occurred when patents 
expire, it can also occur where the validity of patents is disputed or 
successfully challenged before expiry. Such early challenges by 
generics have increased with generic companies increasingly willing  
to launch products ‘at risk’, for example, prior to resolution of the 
relevant patent litigation. This trend is likely to continue, resulting in 
significant market presence for the generic version during the period  
in which litigation remains unresolved, even though the courts may 
subsequently rule that the innovative product is properly protected by 
a valid patent. The unpredictable nature of patent litigation has led 
innovators to seek to settle such challenges on terms acceptable to 
both innovator and generic manufacturer. However, some competition 
authorities have sought to challenge the scope or even availability of 
this type of settlement agreement.
Biologics have, to date, sustained longer life-cycles than traditional 
pharmaceuticals and have faced less generic competition. This is  
due to a more complex manufacturing process for biologics 
compared with small molecule medicines and the inherent difficulties 
in producing a copy of a biologic, or ‘biosimilar’, which is sufficiently 
similar to the innovator to meet regulatory requirements. However, with 
regulatory authorities in Europe and the US continuing to implement 
abbreviated approvals processes for ‘biosimilar’ versions, biologics 
are becoming subject to competition from biosimilars and other 
follow-on biologics.
Building trust 
The pharmaceutical industry faces a challenge in building and 
maintaining trust, particularly with governments and regulators.  
The last 10 years have seen a significant increase in the number  
of settlements between innovator companies and governmental  
and regulatory authorities for violations of a variety of laws. These 
include breaches of sales and marketing practices, inducements  
of physicians to administer a company’s products and breaches  
of anti-trust legislation. For some audiences, there is a perception  
that pharmaceutical companies place their commercial goals above 
the interests of patients, physicians and payers. Companies are taking 
steps to change this perception, by embedding a culture of ethics  
and integrity, adopting higher standards of governance and improving 
relationships with employees, shareholders and other stakeholders. 
For more information about some of the measures we are taking,  
see the Responsible Business section from page 47.
In spite of the challenges, regulators are approving drugs that address 
unmet medical needs when supported by strong data and compelling 
benefit/risk propositions. In addition, health authorities are increasing 
their collaboration with external stakeholders to drive innovation, 
define and clarify approval requirements for personalised healthcare 
and drug-diagnostic combinations, and to accelerate the development 
of treatments that address public health priorities. 
Pricing pressure 
Most pharmaceutical sales continue to be generated in highly 
regulated markets where governments and private payers, such  
as insurance companies, exert various levels of control on pricing  
and reimbursement. Cost containment in healthcare, including 
containment of pharmaceutical spending, continues to be a focus  
and the global economic downturn has enhanced this trend. As a 
consequence, the pricing and reimbursement environments in many 
markets continue to be highly dynamic. It is increasingly important  
for companies to work with governments to promote innovation,  
while ensuring they achieve adequate commercial returns.
Pricing pressures have arisen in the pharmaceutical industry in  
a number of ways in recent years, particularly through the 
implementation of a variety of regulatory drug price control 
mechanisms and other reforms. For example, in Europe, mandatory 
discounts have been applied in Italy. In Germany, Europe’s largest 
pharmaceutical market, there have been freezes on permitted 
pharmaceutical prices. In addition, recent German healthcare reforms 
have transformed the way in which new patent protected drugs  
are assessed. There is no longer a free market for the pricing and 
reimbursement for such drugs. Instead the law in Germany now 
requires manufacturers to prove the additional benefit of their drugs 
over existing alternatives and demonstrate their value to regulators and 
payers. Only by showing additional benefit can the drug avoid being 
transferred to the German reference pricing system, where, for each 
drug group, a single reimbursement level or reference price is set.
China has experienced 26 rounds of cuts to the maximum permitted 
retail drug prices in the last seven years and in Japan and South Korea 
biennial cuts are expected to continue. We are also seeing the 
introduction of fixed hospital tariffs, which can act as a method of 
controlling drug costs by incentivising hospitals to choose cheaper 
generic alternatives. 
Elsewhere, such as in Canada and the UK, increasing use is being 
made of risk sharing agreements, the most common forms of which 
allow health bodies and payers to seek a refund if a drug fails to meet 
certain expectations, with other markets expected to follow. Finally,  
in markets such as France, Mexico and South Korea, price/volume 
negotiations are becoming prevalent. 
In the US, the Affordable Care Act (Act) has already had a direct 
impact on healthcare activities despite the fact that many of the 
healthcare coverage expansion provisions of the Act do not take  
effect until 2014. For example, there has been an increase in drug 
rebates and discounts. The pharmaceutical industry, including 
AstraZeneca, has continued to show its commitment to expanding 
access to government healthcare programmes through, for example, 
helping to close the coverage gap in the Medicare Part D prescription 
drug programme and by paying an annual industry fee. The industry is 
working with policymakers and regulators during the implementation 
of healthcare reform with a view to ensuring that they strike a balance 
between containing costs, while also promoting an environment that 
fosters medical innovation.
In August, as part of the bipartisan agreement to raise the federal  
debt ceiling, the US Congress created the Joint Select Committee  
on Deficit Reduction (Committee). The Committee was empowered  
to recommend a package of $1.2 trillion in cost savings with the 
requirement that, if the Committee failed to reach an agreement, the 
savings would be achieved through across the board spending cuts 
(sequestration). The Committee discussions ended without reaching

Strategy 
to be a focused, integrated, innovation-driven, global, prescription-based biopharmaceutical 
business. Our priorities are to drive:
> World class productivity in R&D
> Increased external collaboration
> Our global orientation, reflecting the growth in Emerging Markets
> Stronger customer orientation, particularly towards payers
> Operational efficiency with a flexible cost base
Values 
principles that define who we are and what is important to us as an organisation, that underpin our mission and our strategy, that 
demonstrate integrity and enhance trust: 
> Integrity and high ethical standards
> Respect for the individual and diversity
> Openness, honesty, trust and support for each other
> Leadership by example at all levels
Our mission is to make the most meaningful 
difference to health through great medicines that 
bring benefit for patients and add value for our 
stakeholders and society. 
The diagram above illustrates the strategic framework which defines 
the direction and shape of the Group to deliver this. We believe that 
the most value-creating strategy for AstraZeneca is to be a focused, 
integrated, innovation-driven, global, prescription-based 
biopharmaceutical business:
>  biopharmaceutical in that we will develop both chemical (small 
molecule) and biological (large molecule) medicines
>  focused in that we will continue to be selective about those areas 
of the pharmaceutical industry in which we choose to compete, 
targeting those product categories where medical innovation or 
brand equity will continue to enable us to make acceptable levels  
of return on our investments
>  integrated in that we believe the best way to capture value within 
this industry is to span the full value chain of discovery, development 
and commercialisation, while continuing to work with partners and 
outsourcing to capture operational efficiencies
>  innovation-driven in that we believe our technology base will 
continue to deliver innovative products that will benefit patients and  
for which payers will pay
>  global in that we believe we have the ability to meet healthcare needs 
in both established and emerging markets efficiently and effectively.
We believe that there continue to be opportunities to create value for 
those who invest in pharmaceutical innovation, and that AstraZeneca  
has the skills and capabilities to take advantage of these opportunities 
and turn them into long-term value through the research, development 
and marketing of medicines. For us, this is the core of our commitment  
to our stakeholders and society. Successful pharmaceutical innovation, 
delivered responsibly, brings benefits to patients, creates sustainable 
value for shareholders and contributes to the economic and social 
welfare of the communities we serve.
Values
Building strong relationships is a critical element of our business 
success. We need to connect with our stakeholders, including patients, 
doctors, regulators, governments and payers, if we are to understand 
their needs and challenges, and deliver on our commitment to improving 
patient health. We also need to earn and maintain the trust of our 
customers, partners and others. This requires us to behave in 
accordance with our core values.

Strategy and Performance
Strategy and Performance Our strategy 19 Our business model
Strategy and Performance
Our business model is driven by our strategy and 
is based on using the best innovative science 
and technology to invent or acquire, produce and 
distribute innovative, patent-protected medicines 
that make a meaningful difference to people’s 
health around the world. 
We also commercialise medicines that do not have patent protection 
where we can obtain prices that reflect the quality and value of our 
brand. To pursue our strategy, we invest in those projects and 
products where we believe medical innovation or brand equity will 
enable us to make acceptable levels of return for our shareholders. 
The Life-cycle of a medicine overview on page 10 illustrates the 
process we use to develop new drugs. It starts with the identification 
of an unmet medical need and market opportunity and the search  
for a potential medicine, and moves through clinical trials and drug 
development, regulatory submission, a medicine’s launch and 
management of its life-cycle. 
An inherent element of our business model is the creation and 
protection of our underlying IP assets. As the diagram below shows, 
the development of a new medicine requires a significant investment 
of resources over a period of 10 or more years before product launch, 
with no guarantee of success. For this to be a viable investment, the 
resulting new medicine must be safeguarded from being copied with  
a reasonable amount of certainty for a reasonable period of time.  
This allows time to generate the revenue we need to reinvest in new 
pharmaceutical innovation. In addition to establishing and defending 
our IP assets (see the Intellectual Property section from page 34) and, 
as illustrated in the diagram, we can also influence the return we make 
on our investment by improving our:
> R&D productivity (see from page 30)
> Sales and marketing effectiveness (see from page 36)
> Operational efficiency (see from page 38). 
A key goal for our planning process is to ensure that we sustain the 
cycle of successful innovation and, as a result, continue to refresh our 
portfolio of patented products and so generate value for shareholders.

AstraZeneca Annual Report and Form 20-F Information 2011 20 Strategy and Performance Our business model Our strategic priorities to 2014
Our goal is to create sustainable value for 
shareholders by being one of the best-performing 
biopharmaceutical companies. To achieve that 
goal, the pace of change across AstraZeneca 
needs to accelerate and we need to deliver on  
the following medium-term strategic priorities.
Pipeline
We are transforming our R&D organisation. We have streamlined and 
refocused our product portfolio, introduced a new operating model, 
and simplified our site footprint. We continue to focus on improving  
the quantity and quality of R&D output, by building industry-leading 
capabilities in critical areas and a more outward-looking organisation, 
which accesses the best science, regardless of origin.
While we are confident that long-term growth in demand for innovative 
biopharmaceuticals will remain strong, it is clear that substantial 
improvement in R&D productivity is needed if we are to sustain 
acceptable returns to shareholders. We are therefore accelerating  
our R&D strategy. We are pioneering innovative ways of conducting 
research. Neuroscience is a challenging field of medical science with 
high unmet need, and one that a number of our competitors have 
chosen to exit. To reinvigorate our efforts in this therapeutic area,  
we plan to create a virtual innovative medicines unit (iMed) in which  
a small group of scientists discover and develop a full pipeline of 
medicines, working with external partners and collaborators.  
They would replace our current scientific and laboratory resources. 
Alongside this, we plan to create a simpler, leaner, more flexible 
organisation through a variety of steps, which better support a  
more focused portfolio. 
Deliver the business
At a time when many companies are exiting primary care, 
AstraZeneca is distinctive for combining a broad portfolio of primary 
and specialty care products with a global reach. We will continue to 
build on our leading positions in Established Markets and to introduce 
innovative ways of serving our customers, using digital and telephone 
channels, service teams, and desk-based medical support. We will 
invest in growth opportunities, including brands such as Crestor and 
Brilinta/Brilique and markets such as Japan and China. We will drive 
sales of our leading products which no longer benefit from patent 
protection where we retain brand equity and can command prices 
which reflect the quality and value of our brand. In addition, we  
will pursue further growth in Emerging Markets by expanding the 
population we serve, supplementing our patented innovative products 
with branded generic products sourced externally and marketed 
under the AstraZeneca brand. To further strengthen revenues, we  
will accelerate our efforts to secure late-stage/on-market product 
licensing, acquisition, and peer collaboration opportunities.
Across the Group, we are investing in our ability to meet the needs  
of those who pay for our medicines. In R&D, our new payer evidence 
group is ensuring that, as we develop our medicines, we gather not 
only the clinical data required for regulatory approval, but also the 
health economics, cost/benefit information and ‘value-in-use’ data 
required by payers. Our HealthCore and IMS collaborations will gather 
real world evidence about the comparative effectiveness of our 
products. This capability helps us to gain global reimbursement,  
broad market access and optimal pricing for our medicines.
Business shape
Given the pressures in the external environment, we will continue to 
simplify the business. Simplification means not only cost reduction, 
but also streamlining processes and shifting to a more flexible cost 
base. In our Commercial organisation, we are simplifying our operating 
model. We are consolidating the business into three regions: the 
Americas, EMEA, and Asia-Pacific, running the global and regional 
organisations from three sites (Wilmington, US, London, UK, and 
Shanghai, China), and changing our Established Markets footprint  
in line with declining sales. Following the success of our Nordic and 
Central American clusters, we are creating further country clusters,  
to share resources and expertise more effectively. Across our Supply 
and Manufacturing function, we continue to drive efficiencies through 
our business improvement programmes, and to use outsourcing and 
partnering to increase flexibility. We are also consolidating many of  
our support services into shared services, driving Lean process 
improvements, investing in automation and new global systems.  
We are outsourcing selected activities to specialist third party 
providers in low cost locations.
People
Talented, motivated and capable people are critical to the successful 
achievement of our strategic ambitions. We are focused on four key 
people priorities, as we lead through significant change in the business:
> acquiring and retaining key capabilities and talent
> further developing leadership and management capabilities
> improving the strength and diversity of the talent pipeline
>  improving employee engagement. 
Responsible business
We reviewed and reshaped our corporate responsibility priority action 
plan during the year, taking into account our strategy, insights gained 
from dialogue with stakeholders, and our internal risk assessment. 
Our new Responsible Business Plan, launched in April 2011, reflects 
our commitment to enhancing the sustainability of our business  
by operating responsibly. It underpins our work and provides the 
framework for applying integrity and high ethical standards across  
all our activities. 
The Responsible Business Plan’s objectives are closely aligned to  
our business strategy. We have given the highest priority to those 
areas most impacted by our strategic priorities, including sales and 
marketing practices, access to healthcare, research ethics (including 
animal welfare), human rights, and supplier management. At the  
same time we have not lost sight of other significant aspects of our 
corporate responsibility, such as patient safety and the environment. 
The Responsible Business Plan is overseen by a Responsible 
Business Council of senior leaders from within our organisation.

Strategy and Performance
Strategy and Performance Our strategic priorities to 2014 21 Restructuring 
Since 2007, we have undertaken significant efforts to restructure and 
reshape our business to improve long-term competitiveness. The first 
phase is complete. It comprised total restructuring costs of $2.5 billion 
and delivered $2.4 billion in annual benefits by the end of 2010, with a 
gross headcount reduction of 12,600.
The second phase, which featured a significant change programme  
in R&D, began in 2010 and was largely completed during 2011. The 
cost phase of this programme totalled $2.1 billion and is expected to 
deliver total annual benefits of $1.9 billion by the end of 2014, of which 
$1 billion had been achieved by the end of 2011. Gross headcount 
reductions associated with this second phase will be around 9,000.
Both restructuring programmes delivered their targeted benefits to 
date. We have invested some of the savings to drive future growth  
and value, such as in our Emerging Markets commercial infrastructure  
and an expansion of our research capabilities in biologics. At the  
same time, we have also improved Core pre-R&D and operating 
margins over the period.
When completed, the next phase of restructuring, announced  
in February 2012, is expected to deliver a further $1.6 billion in  
annual benefits by the end of 2014. Total programme costs are 
estimated to be $2.1 billion (approximately $1.7 billion in cash costs),  
of which $261 million were charged in 2011, and the total number of 
positions expected to be impacted for this phase is estimated to be 
approximately 7,300. Final estimates for programme costs, benefits 
and headcount impact in all functions are subject to completion of  
the requisite consultation processes in accordance with relevant  
local requirements and labour laws.
Medium-term planning assumptions
When we announced our full year results for 2009, we set out a  
series of medium-term planning assumptions which we updated in 
January 2011 and February 2012. We continue to plan on the basis 
that revenue will be in the range of $28 billion to $34 billion per annum 
over the 2010-14 period. However, given increased government price 
intervention, currency movements and the divestment of Astra Tech, 
we now expect the centre of gravity for revenue for the remainder  
of the period is likely to be in the lower half of the range. Using our 
latest assessment, including the Complete Response Letter received 
in January 2012 for dapagliflozin in the US, we have lowered our  
risk adjusted view of the potential revenue contribution in 2014  
from recently launched and pipeline products to between $2 billion 
and $4 billion. 
Based on continued productivity improvements (including successful 
completion of restructuring initiatives), our planning assumption 
remains that Core operating margin, before investment in R&D  
(Core pre-R&D operating margin) will be in the range of 48% to 54%  
of revenue. We expect that these levels of revenue and margins would 
generate the requisite operating cash flow over the planning period  
to support the reinvestment needs of the business, debt service 
obligations and shareholder distributions. Over the planning period, 
we expect that between 40% and 50% of our pre-R&D post-tax cash 
flows will be reinvested in internal and external R&D and capital 
investments to drive future value and growth.
The planning assumptions described above depend in turn on 
assumptions and expectations regarding the development of our 
business, the industry and macro-economic factors. See the Financial 
Review from page 82 for a discussion of our high-level planning 
assumptions. These and other assumptions underlying our expected 
future results are subject to risks and uncertainties and actual results 
may differ significantly from our current expectations. See the Principal 
risks and uncertainties section from page 130.
Non-core businesses
We have actively considered potential shareholder value creation from 
our non-core businesses and, in November 2010, formally initiated a 
review of strategic options for Astra Tech, a global leader in dental and 
healthcare (urological and surgical) products, services and support. 
Our review concluded with the sale of the Astra Tech business to 
DENTSPLY International Inc. for approximately $1.8 billion in cash in  
a transaction that closed on 31 August 2011. Proceeds from the sale 
are being returned to shareholders through share repurchases.
As of 31 January 2012, we had signed binding agreements with four  
of the five hospital-based outpatient cancer centres managed by 
Aptium Oncology, Inc. (Aptium Oncology). Under the terms of these 
agreements, each hospital has acquired Aptium Oncology’s interest  
in the assets used in connection with the operation of the cancer 
centres. Transactions with three of the five hospitals had closed by 
31 December 2011, a fourth closed in January 2012. We expect the 
final transaction to be signed during the first quarter and close during 
the second quarter of 2012. IT transitional services support will be 
provided to each cancer centre during 2012.

Our performance
Within AstraZeneca, each business function is subject to an annual budget and target-setting process that includes developing financial and 
business forecasts, conducting sensitivity and risk analyses, and setting relevant objectives. In setting our objectives we ensure that they are 
aligned with our medium-term planning assumptions and strategic priorities.
Regular reviews are undertaken in order to monitor and assess progress against business and budget targets. During the year we also seek 
to manage the business appropriately, both to optimise our opportunities and to assess key risks and mitigating actions. Quarterly reports 
provide the SET and the Board with insight into progress against current year objectives and milestones for longer-term strategic goals. We 
assess performance using quantitative, comparative market, operational and financial measures, and qualitative analysis.
We have developed KPIs by which we measure our success in delivering our strategy. A description of our KPIs and how we performed 
against them in 2011 is shown below and overleaf.

26 Health Collaboration AstraZeneca Annual Report and Form 20-F Information 2011 healthcollaboration
Improving health is a tough challenge. As tough as 
world poverty and other big challenges like global 
food supply, energy and the environment. 
Despite all the advances in recent decades, major 
diseases are on the increase.
We know that AstraZeneca has a key role to play in 
tackling these challenges with medicines that make 
a real difference. 
We also know that we cannot work in isolation if 
we are to deliver medicines that people really  
need and value. So we work closely with all our 
stakeholders to understand their needs and 
perspectives and how we can combine forces  
to achieve a common goal – improved health.
Strategy and Performance
AstraZeneca Annual Report and Form 20-F Information 2011 Health Collaboration 27 >  Following the acquisition of Novexel in 2010,  
we are collaborating with Forest on the  
co-development and commercialisation of two 
late stage antibiotic development programmes. 
In 2011, we announced that one of these, 
ceftazidime/avibactam (CAZ AVI), is entering 
Phase III trials to investigate its efficacy in treating 
patients with complicated intra-abdominal and 
urinary tract infections.
>  AstraZeneca is one of four companies to have 
signed up to partner with TB Alliance and the 
World Health Organization in a six-way alliance 
through which the companies will share 
information about the tuberculosis (TB) 
compounds in their pipelines to quickly identify 
and collaborate to develop the most promising 
TB drug regimen, regardless of sponsor. Formed 
under the Critical Path to TB Drug Regimens 
(CPTR) initiative, the partnership facilitates a 
more collaborative approach to TB drug 
development. It aims dramatically to speed up 
the development of shorter, safer and more 
effective multi-drug treatments which are 
urgently needed to control the global  
TB pandemic.
>  The Scrip Award for the Best Partnership 
Alliance was won by our Colorectal Cancer 
Collaboration with molecular diagnostics 
company Agendia and the Netherlands 
Cancer Institute. The two-year partnership 
has the objective of accelerating the 
development of targeted therapies for 
colorectal cancer by segmenting it at  
the molecular level. A key feature of the 
partnership is that personalised diagnostics 
may be developed far earlier in the 
development process for new drugs  
than has previously been possible.

Research and Development
We are focused on delivering 
innovative and valued medicines
We are committed to deploying the best science 
and technology to invent and acquire, produce 
and distribute innovative medicines that make a 
meaningful difference to people’s health around 
the world. This commitment is at the core of our 
R&D strategy and continues to drive our focus  
to create valuable medicines for patients that 
recognise the needs of healthcare practitioners, 
governments, payers and external stakeholders 
throughout the healthcare system.
Our R&D organisation continues to evolve to meet the challenges 
facing our industry by investing in high quality science and harnessing 
the innovation of our people. We are continuously improving our 
understanding of mechanisms and targets that will become the 
foundation for developing and delivering tomorrow’s new medicines. 
These efforts are undertaken with the highest ethical standards, as  
we are committed to delivering innovative medicines responsibly.  
More information about our Responsible Business Plan can be found 
from page 47.
Focused R&D portfolio
We continue to prioritise our resources and focus discovery activities 
on those diseases within our existing therapy areas where we believe 
there is the greatest potential to meet patient need through the 
application of novel science. This continual process of prioritisation is 
designed to ensure that the projects we have in our pipeline constitute 
the programmes which we believe are most likely to deliver technical 
and commercial success. 
In 2011, we continued our core research focus on six therapy areas: 
Cardiovascular, Gastrointestinal, Neuroscience, Infection, Oncology 
and Respiratory & Inflammation. Our R&D efforts are supported by 
nine innovative medicine units (iMeds) across small molecule and 
biologics projects. Eight iMeds focus on defined disease areas, with  
a ninth targeting New Opportunities. Our iMeds are responsible for 
discovery and development up to and including Phase II testing  
and delivery of molecules to our Global Medicines Development 
(GMD) organisation for Phase III and registration activities. Our  
GMD organisation provides a single, global platform dedicated to 
conducting trials for small molecules and biologics and is accountable 
for delivering the regulatory packages to support launches of  
new medicines that are commercially attractive and reimbursable.  
In addition to our defined disease areas, we continuously assess 
opportunities to acquire, through purchase or partnership, 
development and commercialisation rights to compounds, targets  
and technologies outside our core therapeutic expertise.
I am passionate about making 
a difference to patients 
through great medicines.  
To create value, we aim to 
unlock the best science 
available from our own labs 
and through partnerships”

Development projects 
Our pipeline includes 79 projects in the clinical phase of development. 
As shown in the Development projects chart above, we now have a 
total of 29 projects in Phase I, 24 projects in Phase II, 10 projects in 
late stage development, either in Phase III or under regulatory review,  
and we are running 23 significant life-cycle management projects. 
During 2011, across the clinical portfolio, 25 projects have successfully 
progressed to their next phase (including five projects entering first 
human testing) and 21 projects have been withdrawn. Further details 
are set out in the Therapy Area Review from page 56 and in the 
Development Pipeline table from page 199. 
Portfolio quality
In 2011, we undertook a thorough assessment of our early portfolio 
projects, resulting in the termination of a number of early projects. 
Going forward, our focus will be on identifying key candidate 
medicines that have the highest potential to deliver technical and 
commercial success. By continuing to apply a rigorous quality 
approach to our candidate selection process, we expect to increase  
the likelihood that our most promising medicines progress into  
Phase III development.
Our Portfolio Investment Board (PIB) plays an important role in 
maintaining portfolio quality through its continued evaluation of our 
projects, designed to ensure that we are maximising the value of our 
R&D investments. More detail relating to the PIB’s responsibilities can 
be found in the Corporate Governance Report from page 99. 
Pipeline delivery
Several milestones for products currently in development were passed 
in 2011. These are shown in the table overleaf and more information 
about these can be found in the Therapy Area Review from page 56.
Of the 21 projects withdrawn in 2011, two were withdrawn following 
failure to obtain the required regulatory or marketing approvals for  
the product candidate or the facilities in which it is manufactured  
and 15 were withdrawn following poorer than anticipated safety or 
efficacy results. The remaining projects were withdrawn following 
assessment of the projects against other product pipeline risk factors 
such as those detailed in the Principal risks and uncertainties section 
from page 130. 
Integrated R&D approach
As demonstrated by the Life-cycle of a medicine section on page  
10, our R&D activities span the entire life-cycle of a medicine. Our 
approach brings together drug discoverers and developers within 
each iMed to focus and collaborate in specific disease areas, while 
continuing to leverage our expertise in late stage development, 
product registration and life-cycle management. This new model  
is designed to increase accountability and enhance scientific 
knowledge-sharing within therapeutic areas. In addition, our single 
R&D strategy enables more effective and efficient delivery of our 
research objectives across the therapeutic portfolio, regardless  
of geography, disease area or stage of development.

Delivering our strategy Research and Development 31 Delivering our strategy
Our collaboration efforts have resulted in a combination of internally 
and externally sourced compounds throughout our portfolio, with 
various development partnerships with biotechnology firms, research 
institutions and other pharmaceutical companies. We previously 
announced our intention to source up to 40% of our pipeline from 
outside our laboratories by 2014 and we are on track to deliver that 
commitment. Collaborating externally enables us to build the value  
of our internally-sourced products and identify external sources of 
cutting-edge science that will enhance and amend our own portfolio 
of compounds. External partnerships announced in 2011 include: 
>  Tremelimumab, a late stage CTLA-4 MAb in oncology which 
AstraZeneca in-licensed from Pfizer for the potential treatment  
of a number of oncology indications.
>  A collaboration with the UK Medical Research Council (MRC) in 
which UK academic researchers are provided with access to over 
20 compounds developed by AstraZeneca, for investigation as 
potential new treatments across a spectrum of diseases.
>  AMG-108, a novel MAb targeting the IL -1 pathway with potential for 
treating certain inflammatory diseases, which AstraZeneca licensed 
from Amgen Inc.
>  A strategic collaboration with the Sarah Cannon Research Institute 
(SCRI), an international leader in advancing therapies for cancer 
patients through clinical research, under which SCRI will lead the 
clinical development of a novel targeted oncology compound from 
AstraZeneca.
>  A collaborative research agreement with Galderma Pharma S.A.,  
a global specialty pharmaceutical company to develop AstraZeneca 
compounds into new treatments for a range of skin conditions 
including psoriasis, acne and atopic dermatitis.
>  A collaboration with Manchester University and GSK to establish  
the Manchester Collaborative Centre for Inflammation Research 
(MCCIR), a translational science centre that will bring together 
industry researchers and academia in an alliance to study chronic 
inflammatory diseases.
>  AZD4694, a late stage radiopharmaceutical imaging candidate, 
out-licensed to Neoprobe Corporation. AZD4694 is a fluorine-18 
labelled radiotracer discovered by AstraZeneca to support 
development of potential treatments for Alzheimer’s disease.
>  Our biologics capabilities signed its first oncology research 
agreement in China with the Shanghai Chest Hospital. The goal  
of this collaboration is to build a database of small and non-small  
cell lung cancer cases.
We continue to search actively for opportunities to advance science 
and public health through research collaborations and partnerships. 
This is demonstrated by our ongoing efforts with organisations  
such as the European Innovative Medicines Initiative (IMI) aimed at 
improving tools, technologies, methodologies and knowledge 
management and additional collaborations with the UK MRC and  
the World Intellectual Property Organisation (WIPO). We have made  
a significant commitment to the field of neglected tropical diseases 
(NTDs) R&D via our founder membership of WIPO’s ‘WIPO Re:Search’ 
consortium. This consortium promotes the formation of research 
partnerships aimed at driving the identification of solutions to NTDs 
which are less commercially attractive disease targets, but have 
particularly severe effects in the world’s least developed countries.  
Our commitment to WIPO Re:Search includes the promise to 
contribute a range of resources, technology and IP.

AstraZeneca Annual Report and Form 20-F Information 2011 32 Delivering our strategy Research and Development Investing in capabilities
A core component of our R&D strategy is strengthening four core 
capabilities. In 2010, we announced an investment of more than  
$200 million over five years to develop capabilities in the areas of 
payer partnering, personalised healthcare, predictive science and 
clinical design. We are making steady progress in building these  
skills both internally and through external collaborations. Examples  
of our efforts in 2011 include:
>  Payer partnering – a new payer evidence function has been 
established to support both our Commercial and R&D organisations 
in addressing the evidence needs of payers at every stage of the 
product life-cycle. A key part of this support comes from new 
capabilities in analysing observational data. We have entered a 
unique collaboration with HealthCore, the health outcomes research 
subsidiary of Wellpoint, Inc., to conduct real world studies, designed 
to determine how to most effectively and economically treat 
diseases. This provides access to the largest commercially insured 
population data environment in the US and is fully operational, 
supporting both development projects and marketed brands. 
Building on this, in January 2012, we signed a three-year collaboration 
agreement with IMS Health Inc., providing AstraZeneca with access 
to pre-existing anonymised health records. This information will 
provide a degree of insight into how medicines that are already on 
the market are working in real-world settings across Europe, and will 
help inform our discovery and clinical development programmes.
>  Personalised healthcare – our personalised healthcare capability 
is focused on identifying patients that are most likely to benefit from 
our medicines. The proportion of our development portfolio utilising 
or investigating personalised healthcare approaches such as the 
use of biomarkers has increased from 25% at the end of 2010 to 
over 50%, including 10 projects that involve a companion diagnostic 
to target therapy. Our recently formed personalised healthcare 
group continues to support Iressa with initiatives to improve the 
speed and quality of diagnostic testing, contributing to Iressa’s 
increase in sales.
>  Predictive science – we are integrating modelling and simulation 
into many different aspects of R&D. We recruited 25 external experts 
from the global modelling and simulation community to accelerate 
the development of our predictive science capability. Modelling  
and simulation is now used in the areas of biology, chemistry, 
formulation development, preclinical and clinical safety assessment, 
pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic evaluation and clinical  
trial simulation. 
>  Clinical design – we implemented a range of innovative changes 
to drive consistency and excellence in the critically important 
capability of clinical trial design and interpretation. Almost 90%  
of our R&D teams have incorporated the changes and are starting  
to utilise a new design and interpretation framework.
Our resources
At the end of 2011, our R&D organisation comprised approximately 
11,300 people at 14 principal centres in eight countries. 
Our R&D transformation that began in 2010 has been largely 
completed, resulting in the closure of several of our R&D facilities  
and a net reduction of 1,400 positions. The exit of R&D personnel  
and activities from the Charnwood site in the UK and the Lund site  
in Sweden was completed in 2011 and the facilities will be closed in 
early 2012. Our approach to implementing such change is outlined  
in the Managing change in our organisation section on page 42.
In February 2012, we announced the next phase of restructuring. 
Further details are set out in the Our strategic priorities to 2014 section 
from page 21.
Our R&D geographic footprint includes four main small molecule 
facilities in: the UK (Alderley Park and Macclesfield); Sweden (MöIndal); 
and the US (Waltham, Massachusetts). Other sites with a focus on 
research are in Sweden (Södertälje), Canada (Montreal, Quebec) and 
France (Reims). We also have a clinical development facility in Osaka, 
Japan. Our principal sites for biologics and vaccines are in the US 
(Gaithersburg, Maryland and Mountain View, California) and in the  
UK (Cambridge). Our Wilmington, Delaware site in the US now focuses 
on late stage development across the portfolio. Finally, our strategic 
expansion in Emerging Markets continues and includes the growth of 
our ‘Innovation Centre China’ research facility in Shanghai, China as 
well as our research facility in Bangalore, India.
In 2011, there was Core R&D expenditure
1
 of $5.0 billion in our 
R&D organisation (2010: $4.2 billion; 2009: $4.3 billion). In addition, 
$189 million was spent on acquiring product rights (such as  
in-licensing) (2010: $1,017 million; 2009: $764 million) and we  
invested approximately $468 million on the implementation of our  
R&D restructuring strategy. The allocations of 2009-2011 spend by 
early and late activities are presented below.

Business Review
Delivering our strategy Research and Development 33 Intellectual Property
We protect the ownership  
of our inventions 
Delivering our strategy
The discovery and development of a new  
medicine requires a significant investment of 
resources by research-based pharmaceutical 
companies over a period of 10 or more years.  
For this to be a viable investment the results,  
new medicines, must be safeguarded from being 
copied with a reasonable amount of certainty for  
a reasonable period of time.
The principal economic safeguard in our industry is a well-functioning 
patent system that recognises our effort and rewards our innovation 
with appropriate protection, allowing time to generate the revenue we 
need to reinvest in new pharmaceutical innovation. Patent rights are 
limited by territory and duration, yet a significant period of this time  
can be spent on R&D of our products and before product launch. We 
therefore commit significant resources to establishing and defending 
our patent and related IP protections for these inventions.
Patent process
We file applications for patent protection for our inventions to 
safeguard the large subsequent investment required to obtain 
approval of potential new drugs for marketing. Further innovation 
means that we may seek additional patent protection as we develop  
a product and its uses. We apply for patents via patent offices around 
the world which assess whether our inventions meet the strict legal 
requirements for a patent to be granted. In some countries, our 
competitors can challenge our patents in the patent offices, and,  
in all countries, competitors can challenge our patents in the courts.  
We can face challenges early in the patent application process and 
throughout the life of the patent. These challenges can be to the 
validity of a patent and/or to the effective scope of a patent and are 
based on ever-evolving legal precedents. There can be no guarantee 
of success for either party in patent proceedings. For information 
about third party challenges to the patents protecting our products, 
see Note 25 to the Financial Statements from page 184.
The basic term of a patent is 20 years from filing of the patent 
application with the relevant government patent office. However,  
the product protected by a pharmaceutical patent may not be 
marketed for several years after patent filing due to the time required 
for clinical trials and the regulatory approval process necessary to 
obtain marketing approval for the product. Patent Term Extensions 
(PTE) are available in certain major markets including the EU and US 
to compensate for these delays. The term of the PTE can vary from  
zero to five years depending on the time taken to obtain any marketing 
approval. The maximum patent term, including any PTE, is however 
capped at 15 years (EU) or 14 years (US) from the first marketing 
approval. The average effective patent term on the market is frequently 
several years less than these maximum terms for reasons including 
unpredictable regulatory timings and the time taken for any required 
pricing negotiations. 
The generic industry is increasingly challenging innovators’ patents  
at earlier stages and almost all leading pharmaceutical products  
in the US have faced or are facing patent challenges from generic 
manufacturers. The result of patent challenges experienced by  
our competitors’ products may lead to the availability of generics in  
the same product class as patented products we currently supply,  
which may materially impact our business. We are also experiencing 
increased challenges elsewhere in the world, for example in Europe, 
Canada, Asia and Latin America. Further information about the  
risks relating to patent litigation and early loss and expiry of patents  
is contained in the Principal risks and uncertainties section from  
page 130.
We seek to protect the value 
of our products and our 
Company, while safeguarding 
our reputation”

Patent expiries
The tables above set out certain patent expiry dates and sales for our 
key marketed products. The expiry dates relate to the basic substance 
patent relevant to that product unless indicated otherwise. The expiry 
dates shown include any PTE and Paediatric Exclusivity periods. 
Data exclusivity
In addition to patent protection, Regulatory Data Protection (RDP  
or ‘data exclusivity’) is an important IP right which arises in respect  
of data which is required to be submitted to regulatory authorities  
in order to obtain marketing approvals for our medicines. Significant 
investment is required to generate such data (for example, through 
conducting global clinical trials) and the use of this proprietary data  
is protected from use by third parties (such as generic manufacturers) 
for a number of years in a limited number of countries. The period  
of such protection and the extent to which the right is respected 
differs significantly between these countries. We believe in enforcing 
our rights to RDP and consider it an important protection for  
our inventions, particularly as patent rights are increasingly  
being challenged.
The period of RDP starts from the date of the first marketing approval 
from the relevant health authority and runs in parallel to any pending 
patent protection. RDP would generally be expected to expire prior to 
patent expiry in all major markets. If a product takes an unusually long 
time to secure marketing approval or if patent protection has not been 
secured, expired or lost, then RDP may be the sole IP right protecting 
a product from copying as generics should not be approved and 
marketed until RDP has expired.
Compulsory licensing
Compulsory licensing (the overruling of patent rights to allow  
patented medicines to be manufactured and sold by other parties)  
is increasingly being included in the access to medicines debate.  
We recognise the right of developing countries to use the flexibilities  
in the World Trade Organisation’s Agreement on Trade-Related 
Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) (including the Doha 
amendment) in certain circumstances, such as a public health 
emergency. We believe that this should apply only when all other ways 
of meeting the emergency needs have been considered and where 
healthcare frameworks and safeguards are in place to ensure that the 
medicines reach those who need them.

Sales and Marketing
We focus on brands and activities 
that make a difference
Our global sales and marketing organisation is 
active in over 100 countries and, at the end of 
2011, comprised approximately 32,300 employees. 
As well as building on our leading positions in the 
US and Other Established Markets, we continue  
to increase our strength in Emerging Markets 
including China, Brazil, Mexico and Russia. See 
the Market definitions table on page 209 for more 
information on AstraZeneca’s market definitions.
We work to ensure success in individual markets by having highly 
accountable local leaders who understand their markets and have a 
strong focus on profitable business growth. This extensive network is 
supported by a single Commercial organisation that develops global 
product strategies and drives commercial excellence, ensuring a 
strong customer focus and commercial direction in the management 
of our pipeline and marketed products. All our efforts are underpinned 
by a commitment to conducting our sales and marketing activity in 
accordance with our values and driving commercial success responsibly.
Driving commercial success
Delivering commercial success requires us to maximise the value of 
our portfolio across the whole life-cycle of a medicine. For an overview 
of this process see the Life-cycle of a medicine section on page 10. 
We do so by connecting our science with our customers’ needs.  
From an early stage in the medicine discovery process we embed 
customer insights into our R&D strategy based on our interactions with 
healthcare providers, patients, regulators and payers. We build on this 
with our local market expertise and knowledge. This approach helps 
us to prioritise resources and optimise our portfolio, thereby delivering 
medicines which customers value and which meet their needs.
Activities in 2011 focused on ensuring continued commercial 
excellence of key products, such as Crestor, Seroquel XR and 
Symbicort, driving growth in new markets and accelerating the 
commercialisation of recently launched products. Recently launched 
products include Onglyza™, Brilinta/Brilique, Vimovo and Caprelsa. 
Brilinta/Brilique has been approved in 64 countries and, while 
launches have occurred in 37 markets, due to the time needed to 
secure reimbursement, formulary approval and protocol adoption,  
full patient access at the end of 2011 was limited to an estimated 12% 
of the acute coronary syndromes market.
Global strategies tailored to meet local needs
We focus on developing global strategies tailored to meet local needs, 
and recognise that our commercial capability must evolve to meet 
future market requirements. The pace and degree of change in global 
economies, and intensifying regulatory and access challenges have 
led us to look at ways of better and more efficiently addressing the 
changing needs and preferences of payers, prescribers and patients.
As part of this effort, in November we announced our consolidation  
into three regions: (the Americas; EMEA; and Asia-Pacific), running the 
regional sales and marketing organisation from three sites: (Wilmington, 
Delaware, US; London, UK; and Shanghai, China), and we are changing 
We will lead the industry in 
commercial innovation that 
brings value to customers  
on their terms and improves 
patient health”

approach to implementing such consolidation is outlined in the 
Managing change in our organisation section on page 42.
All our markets have a role to play in delivering our commercial strategy. 
We continue to prioritise investment and allocate our resources in the 
most cost effective way. This allows us to identify those markets of 
major significance to us, those that will become more important drivers 
of our business in the future and highlight those Established Markets 
where we need to refocus our approach to deliver sustained success.
Creating new commercial sales models
In most countries, our sales are made through wholly-owned local 
marketing companies. In other countries, we sell through distributors 
or local representative offices. Our products are marketed primarily to 
primary care and specialist doctors. Our efforts are directed towards 
explaining the therapeutic as well as the economic benefits of our 
products to doctors, governments and others who pay for healthcare. 
Face-to-face contact is our traditional marketing method and we  
are committed to making this channel as effective and efficient as 
possible. We continue to focus on our customer needs and having 
learnt from successful approaches implemented in North America and 
Europe, we are accelerating the adoption of our new commercial sales 
model which is now live in all our regions; including office-based sales 
teams, dedicated customer service staff and digital channels. 
Our rapid growth in Emerging Markets is driving demand for central 
commercial support, particularly in respect of sales force effectiveness. 
We have adopted and rolled out core sales and marketing training 
programmes in local environments. The main focus of these programmes 
is to embed core commercial skills and to strengthen sales managers’ 
coaching and planning skills while also reflecting local market needs 
and conditions.
Pricing our medicines 
Our challenge is to deliver innovative medicines that improve health  
for patients, bring benefits to society and provide an appropriate return 
on our investment. Our global pricing policy provides the framework  
to ensure appropriate patient access while optimising the profitability 
of all our products in a sustainable way. When setting the price of a 
medicine, we take into consideration its full value to patients, to those 
who pay for healthcare and to society in general. We also pursue a 
flexible approach to the pricing of our medicines. For example, we 
support the concept of differential pricing, provided that appropriate 
safeguards are in place to ensure that differentially priced products  
are not diverted from patients who need them to be sold and used  
in more affluent markets. 
Delivering value for payers
Our medicines play an important role in treating unmet medical need. 
In doing so, they bring economic as well as therapeutic benefits. 
Effective treatments can help to lower healthcare costs by reducing 
the need for more expensive care, such as hospital stays or surgery, 
or through preventing patients from developing more serious or 
debilitating diseases that are costly to treat. They also contribute to 
increased productivity by reducing or preventing the incidence of 
diseases that keep people away from work. 
As outlined in the Pricing pressure section on page 18, there is 
continued downward pressure on drug pricing and, in the current 
difficult economic environment, payers expect us to be able to  
define the value our medicines create. We are acutely aware of the 
challenges facing those who pay for healthcare and are committed  
to delivering value which will allow us to bring our valuable medicines 
to the patients that need them. We therefore work with payers and 
healthcare providers to understand their priorities and requirements, 
and generate evidence regarding how our products offer value and 
support cost effective healthcare delivery.
Broadening affordability
Sales of medicines in our Established Markets enable us to generate 
the revenue we need to provide our shareholders with a return, invest 
in continued innovation and pursue other opportunities to expand  
the availability of our medicines. At the same time, we recognise that 
Emerging Markets will contribute around 70% of pharmaceutical 
industry growth in the five years to 2014. Our programme of investment 
in these markets continues, both in the large faster growing markets 
such as China, Mexico, Brazil and Russia, as well as in high-growth, 
medium-sized and smaller markets. 
As we expand our business in these markets, we are exploring broad 
market strategies to reach new patients, in particular the emerging 
middle income populations who are increasingly able to access 
healthcare systems and for whom our medicines are becoming 
affordable. In some cases, where it is appropriate, we are looking  
at ways of making our medicines more affordable. For example,  
our ‘Broad Market Strategy’ in China means we are expanding our 
marketing activity and broadening affordability of our medicines  
to reach an increasing number of physicians and hospitals in 
communities outside the most affluent cities who do not currently 
have regular access to healthcare and high quality medicines. 
In Brazil, our ‘Faz Bem’ (Wellbeing) programme provides discounts  
to the cost of our medicines to patients across all socio-economic 
groups. The programme also provides additional incentives for  
those patients who adhere to their treatment regimens which helps 
improve health outcomes and benefit our business. Like the Faz Bem 
programme, initiatives in Romania and other Central and Eastern 
European countries attempt to provide similar incentive schemes  
to patients that are unable to complete treatment regimens as a result 
of affordability constraints. 
These approaches are part of our overall Access to healthcare strategy 
which can be found in the Responsible Business section from page 47 . 
A broader portfolio
To support our growth in Emerging Markets, we are broadening our 
portfolio through the launch of branded genericised medicines. This 
range will comprise a portfolio of products which are complementary 
to our patented original medicines in markets where we already have  
a developed commercial infrastructure, existing relationships with 
healthcare professionals and a strong reputation. 
In the second half of 2011, we continued our programme of generic 
launches, with three branded generic products being launched  
in the Philippines. We also launched a generic anti-infective medicine 
in Thailand in December. Against the backdrop of a challenging 
competitive environment, we have re-evaluated our portfolio and are 
now focusing on approximately 70 generic products aligned to our 
wider portfolio which allows us to adopt an integrated selling model. 
We plan to market these generic products under the AstraZeneca 
brand in 20 targeted Emerging Markets. 
In December, we announced we had entered into an agreement to 
acquire Guangdong BeiKang Pharmaceutical Company Limited, a 
generics manufacturing company, based in Guangdong province, 
China. This agreement, which remains subject to regulatory approval  
in China, expected in the first quarter of 2012, will give us access to a 
portfolio of injectable medicines used to treat infections. It underscores 
our intention to serve the health needs of Chinese patients through our 
innovative medicines and, increasingly, high quality branded generic 
treatments that are locally produced to global standards.
Sales and marketing ethics
The pharmaceutical sector is subject to increased oversight by 
regulatory and governmental authorities. As we drive the growth of our 
business and reshape our geographic footprint, we remain committed 
to the responsible delivery of commercial success. You can read more 
about our standards of ethical practice and 2011 performance in the 
Responsible Business section from page 47.

Supply and Manufacturing
We ensure our medicines are 
where they need to be when  
they are needed
Our strategy is to balance innovative and efficient 
in-house manufacturing capabilities with external 
manufacturing resources, particularly in relation 
to the early stages of our production process. 
We also see opportunities to use outsourced 
production in our branded generics business. 
This balance is designed to give us product 
integrity and quality assurance while affording  
us cost efficiency and volume flexibility.
Continuous improvement
We seek to maximise the efficiency of our supply chain through a 
culture of continuous improvement built on the commitment and 
engagement of our employees and a commitment to minimise the 
impact on the environment. We focus on what adds value to our 
customers and patients, as well as waste elimination. This programme 
has delivered significant benefits in recent years, including reduced 
manufacturing lead times and lower average stock levels, both of 
which improve our ability to respond to customer needs and reduce 
inventory costs. All improvements are designed to ensure we maintain 
product quality, safety and customer service.
We have applied Lean production business improvement tools and 
ways of working to improve the efficiency of our manufacturing plants 
for a number of years, and have now applied them to the whole of our 
supply chain. This has led to improvements in quality, lead times and 
overall equipment effectiveness. In 2011, we continued to establish 
more efficient processes, with experts from our global supply chain 
organisation providing cross-functional support throughout the 
business. In October, we launched an online Supply Chain Academy, 
providing ongoing internal training to drive further improvements 
across our end-to-end supply chain. Alongside this we ran an internal 
leadership programme to reinforce the cultural aspects of more 
efficient supply chain processes.
In October, we announced an investment of $200 million to build  
a manufacturing facility in China Medical City in Taizhou, Jiangsu 
province, China to meet growing local demand for our products  
and expand availability of our products to people in urban and rural 
communities. This will be our first manufacturing site to be built using 
Lean principles from the outset. These principles are being applied 
from the planning stage to the whole facility, including operators, 
products, components and equipment. We are designing equipment 
to meet varying demand, enabling fast, reliable changeover. We also 
seek to identify where processes could fail, designing systems to 
minimise these risks.

reliable supply of high quality 
medicines in a cost effective 
way is a culture that drives 
continuous improvement

AstraZeneca Annual Report and Form 20-F Information 2011 38 Delivering our strategy Supply and Manufacturing Product quality
We are committed to delivering product quality that underpins the 
safety and efficacy of our medicines. We have a comprehensive 
quality management system in place designed to assure the quality  
of our products in compliance with relevant regulations.
Manufacturing facilities and processes for medicines must observe 
rigorous standards of quality and are subject to inspections by 
regulatory authorities to ensure compliance with prescribed 
standards. Authorities have the power to require improvements  
to facilities and processes, halt production and impose conditions  
that must be satisfied before production can resume. Regulatory 
standards are not harmonised globally and evolve over time.
We hosted 27 independent inspections from 19 different regulatory 
authorities in 2011. All observations from such inspections are 
reviewed along with the outcomes of internal inspections and 
subsequent improvement actions are put in place as required to 
ensure ongoing compliance. The knowledge obtained from all 
inspections is shared across the Group.
We are actively involved in providing input into new product 
manufacturing regulations, both at national and international levels, 
through our membership of industry associations. For example,  
in the EU we provided input into the Falsified Medicines Directive, 
while in the US we contributed to debates concerning drug  
shortages and security of supply. 
Our resources
Capital expenditure on supply and manufacturing facilities  
totalled approximately $388 million in 2011 (2010: $333 million;  
2009: $360 million). As part of our overall risk management, we 
carefully consider the timing of investment to ensure that secure 
supply chains are in place for our products. We also have a 
programme in place to provide appropriate supply capabilities  
for our new products.
At the end of 2011, approximately 9,600 people at 23 sites in 16 
countries were working on the manufacturing and supply of our 
products. In addition to our planned investment in Taizhou, China,  
our principal small molecule manufacturing facilities are in the  
UK (Avlon and Macclesfield), Sweden (Snäckviken and Gärtuna, 
Södertälje), the US (Newark, Delaware and Westborough, 
Massachusetts), France (Reims), Japan (Maihara), Australia (North 
Ryde), China (Wuxi), Puerto Rico (Canovanas), Germany (Wedel), 
Mexico (Lomas Verdes), Brazil (Cotia) and Argentina (Buenos Aires). 
We currently operate sites for the manufacture of APIs in the UK and 
Sweden, complemented by the efficient use of external sourcing.  
Our principal tablet and capsule formulation sites are in the UK, 
Sweden, Puerto Rico and the US. We also have major formulation 
sites for the global supply of parenteral and/or inhalation products  
in Sweden, France and the UK. 
Some 650 permanent and an additional 140 seasonal people  
are employed at: our four principal biologics commercial manufacturing 
facilities in the US (Frederick, Maryland and Philadelphia, Pennsylvania); 
the UK (Speke); and the Netherlands (Nijmegen) with capabilities in 
process development, manufacturing and distribution of biologics, 
including worldwide supply of MAbs and influenza vaccines.  
Our biologics capabilities are scalable, which enables efficient 
management of our combined small molecule and biologics pipeline. 
Managing sourcing risk
Given our strategy to outsource all API manufacturing, we place 
particular importance on our global procurement policies and 
integrated risk management processes to ensure uninterrupted supply 
of high quality raw materials. Supplies are purchased from a range of 
suppliers. We factor in a wide range of potential risks to global supply, 
such as disasters that remove supply capability or the unavailability of 
key raw materials, and work to ensure that these risks are effectively 
mitigated. Contingency plans include the appropriate use of dual or 
multiple suppliers and maintaining appropriate stock levels. Although 
the price of raw materials may fluctuate, our global purchasing policies 
seek to avoid such fluctuations becoming material to our business.
We also take into account reputational risk associated with our use  
of suppliers and are committed to working only with suppliers that 
embrace standards of ethical behaviour that are consistent with our 
own. For more information, see the Responsible Business section 
from page 47.
Information Technology
Effective and flexible IT support services are critical to delivering our 
strategy. In 2011, we terminated our existing outsource relationship  
for IS infrastructure services and transitioned to a new multi-sourced 
operating model. This includes bringing critical strategic and control 
activities back into AstraZeneca.

People
We are further developing a  
talented and diverse workforce  
in a high performance culture
With approximately 57 ,200 people in over 100 
countries worldwide, we value the talents, skills 
and capabilities that a global workforce brings  
to our business. Our people strategy, which 
defines our approach to managing our workforce 
and supports the delivery of our business 
strategy, is built around four key priorities which 
we believe are critical: acquiring and retaining  
key capabilities and talent; further developing 
leadership and management capabilities; 
improving the strength and diversity of the talent 
pipeline; and improving employee engagement 
while building a high performance culture. 
Managing significant change in the organisation’s 
workforce is also something to which considerable 
management attention is directed. We use a 
range of metrics to track progress against these 
priorities, which are reported quarterly to the SET. 
Acquiring and retaining key capabilities and talent
During 2011, we hired approximately 6,400 permanent employees  
to replace leavers, to fuel the expansion of our business in Emerging 
Markets and to build the new capabilities required to implement  
our strategy successfully. With 1,400 of the new hires having joined 
AstraZeneca in China and 400 in Russia, we have developed a  
range of innovative approaches to ensure that we have an attractive 
employer brand globally and to help us achieve our ambitious growth 
plans in these markets. During the course of the year, we have also 
successfully attracted key talent to supplement critical capabilities 
across the business, including in payer excellence and personalised 
healthcare, and to refresh our leadership pipeline in key areas.
In parallel, we have invested significant management time over the last 
12 months to better understand the key drivers influencing employees’ 
decisions to leave across the business, particularly in markets where 
conditions are most volatile. We have implemented a range of 
initiatives to minimise the risks to the business from such attrition. 
Further developing leadership and management capabilities 
We encourage and support our people in achieving their full potential 
by providing a range of learning and development (L&D) programmes. 
These are designed to build the capabilities and encourage the 
behaviours needed to deliver our business strategy.
Engaged employees, who  
are true to our core values, 
supported by accountable  
and empowered leaders  
driving performance,

AstraZeneca Annual Report and Form 20-F Information 2011 40 Delivering our strategy People We have a global approach, supported by the creation of our global 
talent and development organisation, to ensure that high standards  
of L&D practice are applied across the organisation. We continue to 
develop and deploy instructor-led and online development resources, 
which we aim to make available to all employees to increase access  
to learning and to support self-development.
We recognise the importance of good leadership and its critical  
role in stimulating high levels of performance and engagement.  
Our leadership development frameworks are focused on the core 
capabilities which we believe are essential for strong and effective 
leadership. These capabilities are defined for each level in the 
organisation and apply to all our employees. 
Alongside judicious hiring of new leaders into critical senior roles, such 
as recently into our R&D organisation, the development of an internal 
pipeline of future global leaders is a high priority. We work to identify 
individuals with the potential for more senior and complex roles.  
These talent pools provide succession candidates for a range of critical 
leadership roles across AstraZeneca. We regard these individuals as 
key assets to the organisation and we proactively support them to 
reach their potential through, for example, global talent development 
programmes and targeted development opportunities.
We complement our leadership capabilities with a set of manager 
accountabilities which define what we expect from our managers. 
Building line manager capability is supported by a suite of global 
learning programmes which we have extended during 2011, 
addressing people management, change management and other 
critical capabilities.
We remain committed to making full use of the talents and resource  
of all our people. We have policies in place to avoid discrimination, 
including on the grounds of disability. Our policies cover recruitment 
and selection, performance management, career development and 
promotion, transfer and training (including re-training, if needed, for 
people who have become disabled) and reward.
Improving the strength and diversity of the talent pipeline 
Our global workforce provides a diversity of skills, capabilities and 
creativity and we value the benefits that such diversity brings to  
our business. We aim to foster a culture of respect and fairness  
where individual success depends solely on ability, behaviour, work 
performance and demonstrated potential. As we continue to reshape 
our organisation and geographic footprint, our ongoing challenge is  
to ensure that diversity in its broadest sense is reflected in our 
workforce and leadership, and integrated into our business and 
people strategies. 
We have made progress on our evolving global diversity and inclusion 
strategy following research carried out in 2010 to better understand 
the barriers to women progressing into more senior roles in the 
organisation. Under the leadership of a global steering group chaired 
by our CEO and made up of senior leaders from across the business, 
we are driving change in three key areas: ‘Leadership & Management 
Capability’; ‘Transparency in Talent Management & Career Progression’; 
and ‘Work Life Challenges’. We track gender representation at 
different levels of the organisation and the country of origin of our 
senior leaders to measure progress over the medium term. 
Improving employee engagement 
We use a variety of global leadership communications channels to 
engage employees in our business strategy. These include face-to-
face meetings, video conferencing and Yammer (a social media tool) 
to encourage two way dialogue to take place. For the second year in  
a row our annual global employee survey (FOCUS) included an open 
text feedback mechanism, with around 19,000 comments made on  
a variety of topics.
We measure levels of engagement, the effectiveness of our 
communications and other areas critical to the performance of our 
business, such as leadership and management capabilities, through 
our FOCUS survey. The results are communicated to all employees. 
Ninety one percent of our people participated in 2011. Our employee 
engagement score increased by one percentage point from 2010, 
restoring it to 2009 levels. The leadership category score improved  
by two percentage points and the leadership communication score, 
which was identified as a priority after last year’s survey, improved  
by four percentage points. In 2012, we will build on this further, with 
particular emphasis on clarity of direction and prioritisation from 
leadership teams.
A further area of attention in 2011 was work-life balance, given scores 
in this area had declined between 2008 and 2010. A set of global 
work-life balance principles was agreed and communicated in April 
2011, initiating a range of activities across the business including 
manager dialogues, better use of virtual meeting technologies, and 
health and wellbeing initiatives. Work-life balance category scores 
improved by two percentage points this year, and we intend to 
maintain momentum in this area during 2012.
A key element of our people strategy is the continued development  
of a performance culture across the organisation. By strengthening 
our focus on setting high quality objectives aligned to our business 
strategy, and ongoing coaching and feedback, we strive to ensure  
that performance at all levels of the organisation delivers value. The 
Board is responsible for setting our high-level strategic objectives  
and monitoring performance against them (see the Operation of the 
Board section on page 104). Managers across AstraZeneca are 
accountable for working with their teams to develop individual and 
team performance targets, and for ensuring that our people 
understand how they contribute to overall business objectives.
We will continue to empower our leaders to drive performance, to  
hold our managers accountable for understanding and delivering 
against the standards required, and to provide the tools necessary  
to reward outstanding contributions.
Our focus on optimising performance is reinforced by performance-
related bonus and incentive plans. AstraZeneca also encourages 
employee share ownership by offering the opportunity to participate  
in various employee share plans, some of which are described in the 
Directors’ Remuneration Report from page 113 and also in Note 24  
to the Financial Statements from page 176.

Managing change in our organisation 
The composition of our global workforce continues to evolve.  
Our strategic focus on business growth in Emerging Markets has 
meant the workforce in these areas has grown substantially (as shown 
in the Sales and Marketing workforce composition figures below).  
This increase has been accompanied by headcount reductions as  
a result of our continuing strategic drive to improve efficiency and 
effectiveness. Reductions have come about through restructuring  
in R&D, supply and manufacturing, support functions and our sales  
and marketing workforce in Established Markets, together with the 
disposal of our Astra Tech business. The net effect of these changes 
since the end of 2006 has been to reduce our total headcount by 
some 9,600 from 66,800 to 57,200. This decrease includes a 
reduction of 2,600 positions in 2010 and a further 5,000 in 2011  
which resulted from our business change plans announced in 2010. 
In 2011, the most significant business change was the implementation 
of the R&D strategy announced in 2010, which also involved a number 
of site changes. While the net impact by the end of 2011 was a 
reduction of approximately 1,400 roles, almost all R&D employees 
worldwide were impacted in some way by this change. In order to 
mitigate further job losses, over 750 employees were redeployed 
where appropriate skills and capabilities allowed. We were committed 
to ensuring that AstraZeneca’s core values, robust people policies, 
consultation infrastructure and prior experience were integrated  
into this multi-faceted business transformation. Trade unions and 
employee representative groups were involved throughout the 
restructuring process. With significant investment in outplacement 
support, high levels of success have been achieved in finding 
employees alternative opportunities outside AstraZeneca.
In addition, there were reductions in the number of roles in several 
areas of our sales and marketing organisation in 2011, which were 
incremental to the ongoing restructuring programme announced  
in 2010. The most substantial reduction was in the US, where we 
announced in December that the sales force would be reduced by 
approximately 1,150 leadership positions and sales representative 
roles by the end of February 2012. 
In February 2012, we announced the next phase of restructuring. 
Further details are set out in the Our strategic priorities to 2014 section 
from page 21. 
We work to ensure a level of global consistency in managing employee 
relations, while allowing enough flexibility to support the local markets 
in building good relations with their workforces, taking into account 
local laws and circumstances. To that end, relations with trade  
unions are nationally determined and managed locally in line with the 
applicable legal framework and standards of good practice. However, 
each change programme has its unique challenges and a standard 
solution may not always be appropriate. Where this is the case, the 
appropriate solution is developed through consultation with employee 
representatives or, where applicable, trade unions, with the aim of 
retaining key skills and mitigating job losses.

We ensure a culture of ethics  
and integrity
Our task is to ensure that  
we operate in step with  
the evolving compliance 
environment globally and in  
a way that is consistent with 
our values”
Katarina Ageborg
Chief Compliance Officer
These priorities are closely aligned to the Group’s strategic priorities 
and reflect our drive to strengthen our efforts for oversight at all levels 
of our business, including risk management relating to third parties, 
anti-bribery and anti-corruption. GIA and Global Compliance work 
closely with one another and both separately provide assurance 
reporting to the Audit Committee. Our Global Compliance function 
also works together with a range of specialist compliance functions 
throughout our organisation to ensure ongoing legal and regulatory 
compliance. When a potential compliance breach is identified, an 
internal investigation is undertaken by appropriate staff from our 
Global Compliance, Human Resources and/or Legal teams. When 
appropriate, external advisers are engaged to conduct and/or advise 
on investigations. Should the investigation conclude that an actual 
compliance breach has occurred, management, in consultation  
with our Legal function will consider whether the Company needs  
to make a disclosure and/or to report the findings to a regulatory or 
governmental authority. More information on GIA and our overall risk 
management and control framework can be found in the Corporate 
Governance Report from page 103. 
Code of Conduct 
Our Code of Conduct (the Code) is at the core of our compliance 
programme and applies to all our employees at every level and in 
every country in which we operate. It has been translated into over  
40 languages and each employee has a copy in his/her local language. 
It provides clear direction as to how our commitment to honesty and 
integrity is to be translated into consistent actions across all areas  
of the business. Every employee receives training on the Code and 
compliance with it is mandatory. Similarly, every employee is required 
to comply with local laws and regulations, as well as applicable national 
and international codes. We always seek to operate at the highest of 
these various standards, whether this is our Code, national legislation 
or other applicable codes. The Code is regularly reviewed and updated 
to take account of our changing legal and regulatory obligations. 
The Code includes information on how to report possible violations  
of the Code, including through the AZethics telephone lines and the 
global website, AZethics.com. Anyone who raises a possible breach  
in good faith is fully supported by management. We take all alleged 
compliance breaches and concerns extremely seriously and 
investigate and report them to the Audit Committee, as appropriate. 
In 2011, 222 reports of alleged compliance breaches or other ethical 
concerns were made via telephone, the AZethics.com website, or the 
Global Compliance email or postal addresses described in the Code.  
In 2010, the number of reports through equivalent channels was 368. 
This decrease is in the context of a significant increase in management 
self-reporting of compliance incidents, which can be seen as an 
indication that employees are more comfortable in raising their concerns 
with line managers, local Human Resources, Legal or Compliance,  
as recommended in the Code and reinforced in the 2011 annual  
Code training.
As with the Code, our global policies apply to all members of our 
Group. They provide clear and comprehensive guidance, in plain 
language, to all managers and employees as to their accountabilities 
in key ethical, compliance and corporate responsibility risk areas.  
We report on the operation of our Global Policy on External 
Interactions on page 51.
We work to promote best practice in compliance 
within AstraZeneca in the rapidly changing 
external environment in which we operate. This  
is critical to ensuring the trust of our stakeholders 
and the patients we serve.
Our Global Compliance function has been established to drive and 
embed a culture of ethics and integrity within our organisation. The 
addition of Global Compliance to the SET reflects the growing 
importance of compliance to our business operations. 
Our key compliance priorities include:
> focusing our efforts on important compliance risk areas 
> communicating clear policies to employees 
>  improving compliance behaviours through effective training  
and support 
>  ensuring employees can raise concerns and that those concerns 
will be properly addressed 
> ensuring fair and objective investigations of possible policy breaches 
>  monitoring and auditing compliance with policies and working  
with GIA 
>  providing key stakeholders with assurance and effective reporting  
of material issues.

Introduction
At AstraZeneca, we are dedicated to the research, development, 
manufacture and marketing of medicines that make a difference in 
healthcare. For us, this is at the core of our responsibility to our 
stakeholders and to society. Successful pharmaceutical innovation, 
delivered responsibly, brings benefits for patients, creates sustainable 
value for shareholders and contributes to the economic development 
of the communities we serve. 
Previous sections have described our strategic business priorities  
and how we are enhancing our R&D, expanding our footprint in 
Emerging Markets, continuing our efforts to source innovation from 
outside AstraZeneca and increasingly working in partnerships that 
broaden the base for success in improving healthcare. At the same 
time, we continue to drive efficiency and effectiveness across the 
organisation, including increased outsourcing to a diverse range of 
strategic suppliers.
All of these efforts are underpinned by our continued commitment  
to the sustainable development of our business which delivers value 
for our stakeholders and for us. To that end, our responsible business 
objectives must be closely aligned to, and support delivery of, our 
business strategy. Our new Responsible Business Plan, published in 
April 2011, provides our framework for delivering business success 
responsibly. It puts at the top of our agenda those areas most 
impacted by our strategic priorities and which are therefore key 
enablers of our business strategy. 
This means a specific focus on:
>  Clinical trials and animal research – underpinning our drive for 
innovation with sound ethical R&D practice worldwide
>  Sales and marketing practices – driving consistently high ethical 
standards to promote our medicines responsibly worldwide
>  Access to healthcare – exploring ways of increasing access to 
healthcare for underserved patient populations in a sustainable way
>  Human rights – making sure that we continue to develop and drive  
a consistent approach across all our activities
>  Diversity and inclusion – ensuring that diversity, in its broadest 
sense, is appropriately represented in our leadership, our  
workforce and our thinking. See the People section from page 40  
for more information
>  Suppliers – working only with organisations who embrace ethical 
standards that are consistent with our own.

A summary of these areas of focus is provided in this section.  
The full Responsible Business Plan is available on our website,

Accountabilities and responsibilities
The Board is responsible for our Responsible Business framework 
and Non-Executive Director, Dame Nancy Rothwell, oversees 
implementation and reporting to the Board. 
The SET and senior managers throughout the Group are accountable 
for operating responsibly within their areas taking into account 
national, functional and site issues and priorities. Line managers are 
accountable for ensuring that their teams understand the requirements 
and that people are clear about what is expected of them as they 
work to achieve AstraZeneca’s business goals. Individually, everyone 
has a responsibility to integrate sustainability considerations into their 
day-to-day decision making, actions and behaviours.
Our dedicated Global Corporate Responsibility Team (CR Team) 
works together with the SET areas across the business to ensure  
that responsible business risks and opportunities are identified and 
managed appropriately, in line with our strategic business objectives.
Responsible business governance
During 2011, we established the Responsible Business Council (the 
Council) – a cross functional team of senior leaders, chaired by our 
EVP, HR and Corporate Affairs. The Council will meet twice a year  
and their agenda is focused on driving long-term value creation by 
agreeing, among other things:
>  Responsible Business priorities for the Group in line with strategic 
business objectives
>  Strategy and overseeing performance as measured by short- and 
long-term objectives, targets and key performance indicators 
recorded in the Responsible Business Plan
>  Appropriate policy positions to support AstraZeneca’s business 
objectives and reputation management.
The Council is supported by a newly established Responsible 
Business Working Group (the Working Group) of SET area 
representatives and our CR Team, chaired by the Head of Corporate 
Affairs Strategy, Brand and CR. Among other things, the Working 
Group continuously reviews external issues with the potential to 
impact AstraZeneca and, as appropriate, prepares management  
and measurement proposals for the Council’s consideration.  
The Working Group will meet four times a year.
External engagement and benchmarking
Stakeholder dialogue was critical in the development of our 
Responsible Business Plan and we continue to engage with our 
stakeholders to ensure that our strategy development and risk 
management take account of their feedback.
During 2011, we developed a global framework for multi-stakeholder 
engagement to provide a consistent, best practice-based approach 
across AstraZeneca and to improve how we capture feedback from 
around the world. 
We held a number of multi-stakeholder events throughout the year. 
These included an event specifically for key Socially Responsible 
Investor (SRI) contacts. The agenda reflected areas of interest 
expressed by the SRI community and focused on growth in Emerging 
Markets, sustaining innovation in R&D and managing environmental 
impact. Feedback following the event was generally positive and  
the opportunity to interact with senior AstraZeneca leaders was 
particularly welcomed by the participants. Discussion centred on  
how we are managing the potential challenges to sustainability as  
we expand our business and drive R&D productivity. The SRIs also 
highlighted that they wanted more information on our access to 
healthcare strategy. 
We also hosted a discussion on global product security during the 
year. This brought together representatives from diverse organisations, 
geographies and perspectives to gain insights into what our 
stakeholders expect from us in the area of product security, and  
to gain new perspectives on how we can reduce the threat that 
counterfeiting and illegal trade pose to global health. Attendees 
included NGOs, supply chain partners, academics and enforcement 
professionals from both the developed and developing world. The 
discussion focused mainly on the critical need for collaboration 
between all the key players in this area, including the role that 
AstraZeneca can play, working with other manufacturers and 
influencing broader stakeholders regarding policy and regulation, 
enforcement and activities to influence patient understanding and 
behaviour. Product security is an inherent part of our commitment to 
patient safety, which continues to be a fundamental consideration.
In addition, we use the insights we gain from external surveys to 
develop our approach in line with global best practice. A member of 
the Dow Jones Sustainability Index since 2001, AstraZeneca achieved 
its highest ever placing in the 2011 World Index. We also retained our 
listing on the DJSI STOXX – European index (the top 20% of the 600 
largest European companies) for the fourth year running (one of only 
four pharmaceutical companies to do so out of 14 assessed). We 
achieved a total score of 85% (2010: 81%) compared with a sector 
best score of 87% (2010: 87%). We increased individual scores for  
14 out of 23 criteria for 2011 (compared to nine out of 23 criteria in 
2010) including corporate governance, R&D, environmental policy  
and supplier standards. While these scores are encouraging, we lost 
ground in some areas including marketing practices and health 
outcomes contribution. To better understand these lower scores,  
we have commissioned an in-depth external benchmark survey  
and the analysis will be used to inform our improvement planning.  
The survey is expected to report in the first quarter of 2012.

Improving the health  
of young people
The Young Health Programme is a global programme. In India it is focused on  
improving hygiene, infection and reproductive health in five settlement areas in Delhi.
India has the fastest growing number of urban poor in the world. However, services and 
infrastructure have not kept pace with rapid urbanisation. There are significant issues 
related to water and sanitation, including lack of potable water, waste disposal and 
sewage maintenance. Access to health services is limited and awareness about sexual 
and reproductive health and HIV/AIDS is low.
Our programme seeks to improve the health of adolescents by empowering them with 
necessary information, skills and access to services. Objectives for the programme 
include enabling better choices about health and lifestyle, as well as improving health 
seeking behaviours through raising awareness and knowledge about healthcare and 
access to available healthcare systems.
The programme is being implemented by Plan India in partnership with the Community 
Aid and Sponsorship Programme (CASP). Since its launch in November 2010, over 
30,000 young people have received health information.
Business Review
AstraZeneca Annual Report and Form 20-F Information 2011 Health Integrity 49 Delivering our strategy
R&D ethics
We want to be recognised for our high quality science and for the 
impact we can make on serious diseases, and to be trusted for the 
way we work. Our standards of R&D ethics are global and apply to  
all AstraZeneca research activity, in all locations, whether conducted 
by us or on our behalf by external contract research organisations 
(CROs). We continue to work to ensure that these standards are 
applied, particularly as we expand our activity in countries such as 
China and Russia.
Clinical trials
We conduct clinical trials at multiple sites in several different countries. 
A broad geographic span helps us to ensure that those taking part in 
our studies reflect the diversity of patients around the world for whom 
the new medicine is intended. This approach also helps to identify the 
types of people for whom the treatment may be most beneficial.
Our global governance process for determining where we place 
clinical trials provides the framework for ensuring a consistent 
approach worldwide. We take several factors into account, including 
the availability of experienced and independent ethics committees  
and a robust regulatory regime, as well as sufficient numbers of trained 
healthcare professionals and patients willing to participate in a trial. 
Before a trial begins, we work to make sure that those taking part 
understand the nature and purpose of the research and that proper 
procedures for gaining informed consent are followed (including 
managing any special circumstances, such as different levels of 
literacy). Protecting participants throughout the trial process is a  
core priority and we have strict procedures in place to ensure that  
they are not exposed to any unnecessary risks.

 Small molecule studies  
 Biologics studies 
We recognise that situations may exist where continued provision of  
a non-approved clinical study drug to patients is both appropriate and 
necessary following the completion of a clinical study. During 2011,  
we introduced a new standard to provide global guidance in this area. 
Factors we take into account include the severity of the disease, the 
availability of alternative treatments, the individual patient response to 
the medicine, and the overall benefit/risk profile of the medicine based 
on completed and ongoing studies. If we continue to provide a clinical 
study drug after the original study is completed, we ensure that 
appropriate oversight measures are in place, such as dispensing 
treatment in the context of a clinical study or a compassionate use 
programme.
All our clinical studies are conceptually designed and finally interpreted 
in-house but a percentage of them are run for us by CROs. In 2011, 
around 39% of patients in our small molecule studies and around 66% 
of patients in our biologics studies were monitored by CROs on our 
behalf. We contractually require CROs to work to our global standards 
and we conduct risk-based audits to monitor compliance.
We publish information about the registration and results of all our 
clinical trials, whether favourable or unfavourable to AstraZeneca,  
on a range of public websites including our own dedicated site, 
astrazenecaclinicaltrials.com. By the end of 2011, we had registered 
over 1,370 trials and published the results of more than 1,150. 
Animal research
Animal studies continue to play a vital role in the search for new 
medicines. They provide essential information, not available through 
other methods, about the effects of a potential new therapy on 
disease and the body. Regulatory authorities around the world also 
require safety data from preclinical testing in animals before a new 
medicine can be tested in humans.
As we work to improve our R&D productivity, we remain committed to 
minimising our use of animals without compromising the quality of the 
research data. All research using animals is carefully considered and 
justified, not only to confirm the scientific need for a study, but also to 
make sure that it has been designed so that the minimum number of 
animals is used and that they are exposed to as little pain and distress 
as possible.
Wherever possible, we use non-animal methods, such as computer 
modelling, that eliminate the need to use animals early in drug 
development or reduce the number required. We also work to refine 
our existing methods. This replacement, reduction and refinement  
of animal studies is known as ‘the 3Rs’ and to support our drive for 
continuous improvement, we work both within AstraZeneca and the 
wider scientific community to share 3Rs knowledge and learning.
The number of animals we use will continue to vary because it 
depends on a number of factors, including the amount of preclinical 
research we are doing, the complexity of the diseases under 
investigation and regulatory requirements. We believe that, without  
our active commitment to the 3Rs, our animal use would be much 
greater. In 2011, we used approximately 381,400 animals in-house 
(2010: 408,000). In addition, approximately 16,600 animals were  
used by external CROs on our behalf (2010: 21,000).
The welfare of the animals we use continues to be a top priority and 
our standards apply worldwide. In addition to mandatory inspections 
by government authorities, we have a formal programme of regular 
peer reviews of our internal animal research facilities conducted by  
our own qualified staff. External CROs that conduct animal studies on 
our behalf are required to comply with our global standards and we 
undertake audits to ensure our expectations are being met.
AstraZeneca Annual Report and Form 20-F Information 2011 50 Delivering our strategy Responsible Business Protests
AstraZeneca acknowledges the right of every individual to express 
their views on the use of animals in research but we condemn the  
use of violence and other illegal acts. We firmly reject any harassment, 
intimidation or harming of our employees and their families, our 
suppliers and our other stakeholders as totally unacceptable.
Sales and marketing ethics
Delivering consistently high standards of sales and marketing practice 
continues to be one of our top priorities and is at the core of our 
commitment to driving commercial success responsibly. Our activities 
centre on ensuring that the appropriate information is provided to 
those who need it to support the safe and effective use of our 
medicines and enhance patient care.
We have always had a range of sales and marketing policies and 
standards in place but, following a review in 2010, we further 
strengthened the requirements and consolidated the range to form  
a single new Global Policy on External Interactions (the Policy). 
Launched in April 2011, the new Policy provides a single common, 
principle-based approach to all our interactions worldwide. Everyone 
in AstraZeneca, wherever they are located, is required to work to our 
global standards of ethical sales and marketing practice. We believe 
this is especially important as we grow our business in Emerging 
Markets, such as China and Russia, alongside our continued efforts  
in Established Markets, including the US and Japan.
The diversity of business cultures around the world means that  
putting a global approach into practice at a local level is a challenge. 
Nevertheless, we are committed to making it work. During 2011,  
we continued to provide targeted training for our people to ensure 
expectations and accountabilities were clear and understood as well 
as where to obtain further advice and support if needed. We are also 
talking to our customers and other stakeholders to explain the 
changes they are seeing to the way we are working with them.
We have comprehensive processes in place for monitoring 
compliance with our Code of Conduct and global policies, including 
dedicated compliance professionals who support our line managers 
locally in monitoring their staff activities. We also have a nominated 
signatory network that works to ensure that our promotional materials 
meet all applicable requirements.
Instances of potential non-compliance are collected through our 
compliance incident management processes and reviewed by senior 
management in local and/or regional compliance committees. Serious 
breaches are reviewed by the Audit Committee and, if appropriate, the 
Board. More information about our compliance and risk assurance 
processes is contained in the Managing risk section from page 129.
We take all breaches very seriously and act to prevent repeat 
occurrences. In 2011, we identified a total of 17 confirmed breaches of 
external sales and marketing regulations or codes globally (2010: 11; 
2009: 24). Excluding the confirmed external breaches, there were 
1,275 instances of failure to comply with our Code of Conduct and 
global policies in our Commercial organisation, including contract 
staff. In relation to all these breaches we removed 214 people from 
their role, formally warned 570 people, and provided further guidance 
or coaching on our policies for 971 people. It is important to note that 
a single breach can involve more than one employee failing to meet 
the standards required. 
We believe that the increase in identified breaches is due in part to  
our enhanced management oversight of compliance and heightened 
awareness of policy requirements through targeted training, alongside 
improved data capture mechanisms. However, we acknowledge that 
our numbers are likely to continue to vary as we reshape our business 
and geographic footprint. We will continue to focus our compliance 
efforts appropriately.

US Corporate Integrity Agreement reporting
In April 2010, AstraZeneca signed an agreement with the US 
Department of Justice to settle an investigation relating to the  
sales and marketing of Seroquel IR. The requirements of the 
associated Corporate Integrity Agreement between AstraZeneca and 
the Office of the Inspector General of the US Department of Health 
and Human Services (OIG) include a number of active monitoring  
and self-reporting obligations that differ from self-reporting required  
by authorities in the rest of the world. To meet these obligations, 
AstraZeneca provides notices to the OIG describing the outcomes  
of particular investigations potentially relating to violations of certain 
laws, as well as a separate annual report to the OIG summarising 
monitoring and investigation outcomes relevant to Corporate Integrity 
Agreement requirements. 
Access to healthcare 
Providing sustainable access to healthcare for all those who need it  
is a significant global challenge. The complexities surrounding the 
issue mean that there is no ‘one size fits all’ solution. Factors affecting 
access range from the affordability of medicines to the availability  
of healthcare systems and the resources to make them effective.  
We believe it will take a combined global effort involving all related 
stakeholders to drive sustainable progress in increasing access to 
healthcare worldwide and we know that, as a global biopharmaceutical 
company, we can make a meaningful contribution to that effort. 
Our strategy takes account of the different barriers to healthcare in 
different parts of the world and, because access to healthcare can 
also vary within a country, our approach is tailored locally to meet the 
needs of different patient populations. We are pursuing a range of 
different initiatives across these populations to understand what works 
best and in what context. We believe we will be able to make the 
biggest contribution to improving health where we are able to adopt  
a commercial approach. Our goal is always to improve health for 
patients and add value for our stakeholders and our business.
>  Our mainstream business will continue to focus on those people  
for whom healthcare is readily available and who can afford our 
medicines. The selling of these medicines in our Established 
Markets helps enable us to generate the revenue we need  
to provide our shareholders with a return, invest in continued 
innovation and pursue other opportunities to increase the  
availability of our medicines.

Business Review
Delivering our strategy Responsible Business 51 Delivering our strategy
>  As we expand our business in new geographies, we are exploring 
broad market strategies to reach new patients, in particular the 
emerging middle income populations who are increasingly able  
to access healthcare systems and for whom our medicines are 
becoming affordable. You can read more about our efforts to 
broaden access to our medicines in the Sales and Marketing  
section from page 36.  
>  The availability of medicines is not always the primary challenge. 
Access to healthcare also depends on having a functioning 
healthcare system and the right allocation of resources to make  
sure that medicines are used appropriately as part of overall health 
management. For people in communities with limited healthcare 
infrastructure we partner with others to help strengthen healthcare 
frameworks and capabilities.
  We have defined some common criteria to guide our commitment 
and ensure that all our partnerships centre on delivering meaningful 
and enduring benefit. The key principles are that our partnerships:
 >  lead to positive, measurable outcomes in underserved 
communities 
 >  can be scaled up and potentially replicated to improve outcomes 
for a greater number of people
 >  deliver a sustainable framework that can ultimately be owned  
and managed locally, without the need for our support. 
  Such partnerships can also contribute to our business 
development, by enabling us to understand better the health  
needs of, and build important relationships in, markets of the  
future. An example is our Phakamisa initiative in South Africa  
(see page 55 for further information).
  We also partner with NGOs who are experienced at tackling 
disease at a community level. For example, we have been 
supporting the British Red Cross since 2002 in their work to tackle 
TB and TB/HIV in Kyrgyzstan, Turkmenistan and Kazakhstan and, 
more recently, in South Africa and Lesotho. To date, over 16,000 
people have been directly supported in completing their TB 
treatment across all our partnership countries and TB mortality  
and morbidity rates continue to fall in our partnership countries in 
central Asia. Our partnership with the African Medical and Research 
Foundation (AMREF), created in 2007, centres on strengthening 
healthcare systems and integrating the management of malaria, 
HIV/AIDS and TB (MAT) programmes in Uganda, where there is  
a high burden of all three diseases. Progress to date includes six 
laboratories upgraded to Ministry of Health standards to support 
improved diagnosis and over one million patient visits recorded in 
the Health Management Information System as having received 
MAT diagnostic, treatment and other services.
  Our most recent community investment, the AstraZeneca Young 
Health Programme (YHP) is designed to help young people in need 
around the world deal with the health issues they face so they can 
improve their chances of living a better life. We are working with 
expert partners, Plan International and Johns Hopkins Bloomberg 
School of Public Health, to identify the needs in our local communities 
and to help address these needs with a combination of work on the 
ground, research and advocacy. Adolescent health remains an 
underserved part of the healthcare agenda and this global investment 
initiative aims to make a measurable and sustainable difference. 
YHP initiatives are now in place in nine countries and our target is  
15 by the end of 2012. By 2015, YHP will reach 500,000 young 
people between the ages of 10 and 24 directly and will touch an 
additional 500,000 lives indirectly.
 
>  On a broader basis, we collaborate at a global level to increase 
understanding of fast-emerging and existing health threats in the 
developing world, and to lend our skills and resources to addressing 
these. For example:
 >  In partnership with the IFPMA, AstraZeneca is undertaking policy 
research to understand practical steps to overcome the barriers 
to treatment and care for non-communicable diseases (NCDs) 
which are fast overtaking communicable diseases as a 
developing world health threat. The challenges that NCDs present 
are not new to us. We have many decades of experience in NCD 
treatment, with a strong product portfolio and pipeline of new 
medicines targeting these areas. The majority of our research 
investment continues to centre on NCDs. 
 >  Alongside the rising challenge of NCDs, the battle against TB and 
neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) is far from over. Scientists at 
our dedicated research facility in Bangalore, India are focused on 
finding a new treatment for TB. For further information about this, 
see the Infection section from page 64. As outlined in the 
Research and Development section from page 30, during 2011, 
we joined the World Intellectual Property Organization’s (WIPO) 
Re:Search initiative. This unprecedented collaboration between 
the private sector and public partners will make publicly available 
a searchable database of available IP assets and resources for 
use in NTD research to speed the discovery and development  
of new potential treatments.
More information about our Access to healthcare strategy  
and the associated initiatives is available on our website,  
astrazeneca.com/responsibility.
Human rights
As we reshape our organisation, grow our business and increase  
our outsourcing, we are working to make sure that human  
rights continue to be appropriately integrated into our policies  
and processes.
AstraZeneca is a signatory to the United Nations Global Compact 
(UNGC), a strategic public-private initiative for organisations committed 
to social and environmental sustainability. This means that we have 
committed to uphold 10 internationally recognised principles in the 
areas of human rights, labour standards, environmental sustainability 
and anti-corruption. These are long-standing principles for AstraZeneca 
(as described in our Code of Conduct and global policies) but being 
part of the UNGC reinforces how seriously we take these principles.  
It also gives us the framework for further developing our approach.
In recent years, we participated in a project led by the Danish Institute 
for Human Rights (DIHR), working with the pharmaceutical industry  
to develop a human rights assessment tool for pharmaceutical 
companies, based on the DIHR’s existing Human Rights Compliance 
Tool. The first pharmaceutical industry version of the tool was 
launched in November 2010 and we used it to conduct a labour 
review in 11 of our marketing companies, including some countries 
where national labour standards are inconsistent with global best 
practice. The review focused on International Labour Organization 
core areas (freedom of association and collective bargaining, forced 
and bonded labour, child labour, discrimination and working time  
and wages). 
Building on the experience of this review, we adapted and simplified 
the employment section of the assessment tool and, during the 
remainder of 2011, used it to conduct a labour review in every country 
where AstraZeneca has employees. 
The results of all our 2011 reviews are currently being collated and 
analysed to identify what we are doing well and where we may need 
to improve. Any areas identified for improvement will be included in  
our local people strategies in the relevant countries. 
AstraZeneca Annual Report and Form 20-F Information 2011 52 Delivering our strategy Responsible Business Also in 2011, the DIHR in collaboration with AstraZeneca, GSK, 
Novartis and Merck established the Human Rights Assessment Tool 
for Pharmaceuticals Companies Forum (the Forum). The Forum is a 
means of sharing information, experience and best practice, helping 
members to better understand what it means to integrate human 
rights into daily business practice and to further clarify human rights 
responsibilities for pharmaceutical companies.
Working with suppliers
Our ongoing drive to support increased efficiency through our 
procurement activity continues to be underpinned by our work to 
make sure that our purchasing is directed only to those organisations 
which embrace ethical standards consistent with our own. 
Our Global Responsible Procurement Standard (the Standard)  
defines one of the key business processes for integrating our  
ethical standards into our procurement activity and decision making 
worldwide. It includes detailed expectations of suppliers. In addition, 
responsible procurement clauses that include audit requirements  
are incorporated in supplier contracts. We continue to review the 
Standard to ensure it appropriately reflects our commitment and 
during 2011, revised it to strengthen the anti-bribery and anti-
corruption (ABAC) requirements in line with our ABAC policy and  
the requirements of the UK Bribery Act. 
The process outlined in our Standard applies to suppliers of goods 
and services globally and is focused on ensuring that our responsible 
business expectations are being met. Specific expectations of 
suppliers such as healthcare professionals or CROs are managed 
within the relevant functions using specific assessment and  
monitoring processes.
Our Responsible Procurement process is based on an escalating set 
of risk-based due diligence activities, applied in a pragmatic way. The 
same initial assessment process is used for all suppliers and more 
detailed, focused assessments are then made, relevant to the service 
provided. Full details of the process are available on our website, 
astrazeneca.com/responsibility.
By the end of 2011, we had completed 3,342 responsible 
procurement risk assessments accounting for 71% of our third  
party spend. 
We categorise suppliers as high, medium or low risk. We focus our 
auditing efforts on high and medium risk rated suppliers but we also 
audit some suppliers that we consider to be lower risk, to confirm our 
performance expectations across all suppliers we do business with.  
In 2011, we worked with our suppliers to substantially increase our 
audit activity. 727 suppliers across 55 countries have participated in 
751 audits undertaken this year (48 audits and 42 suppliers in 2010). 
Forty five percent of supplier sites audited demonstrated standards 
that met our expectations with a further 51% implementing 
improvements to address non-compliances. We monitor progress 
across all corrective actions and 4% of suppliers audited this year will 
require significant follow up to confirm they will make the improvements 
we require. We will not use suppliers who are unable or unwilling to 
meet our expectations in a timely way. 
Our audits are conducted through a combination of internal resources 
and external independent auditors. Our assessment programmes 
reflect best practice from other industry sectors as well as the 
principles of the Pharmaceutical Supply Chain Initiative. 
Patient safety
The safety of the patients who take our medicines will always be  
a fundamental consideration for us. All drugs have potential side 
effects and we aim to minimise the risks and maximise the benefits  
of each of our medicines, beginning with the discovery of a potential 
new medicine and continuing throughout its development, launch  
and marketing.
After launch, we continually monitor the use of all our medicines to 
ensure that we become aware of any side effects not identified during 
the development process. This is known as pharmacovigilance and is 
core to our ongoing responsibility to patients. We have comprehensive 
and rigorous pharmacovigilance systems in place for detecting and 
rapidly evaluating such effects, including mechanisms for highlighting 
those that require immediate attention. We also work to ensure that 
accurate, well-informed and up-to-date information concerning the 
safety profile of our drugs is provided to regulators, doctors, other 
healthcare professionals and, where appropriate, patients.
We have an experienced, in-house team of clinical patient safety 
professionals working around the world who are dedicated to the task 
of ensuring that we meet our commitment to patient safety. At a global 
level, every medicine in development and on the market is allocated  
a Global Safety Physician and a team of patient safety scientists.  
In each of our markets we also have dedicated safety managers with 
responsibility for patient safety at a local level.
Our two Chief Medical Officers (one for small molecule products and 
one for biologics) have overall accountability for the benefit/risk profiles 
of the products we have in development and those on the market. 
They provide medical oversight and ensure that appropriate risk 
assessment processes are in place to enable informed decisions  
to be made about safety as quickly as possible.
We use an external provider, Tata Consultancy Services (TCS), to 
manage the data entry process for individual case safety reports 
relating to our products. As experts in their field, TCS continues to 
drive improvements in the efficiency and consistency of data entry 
across AstraZeneca and using TCS for this work means our patient 
safety teams can focus primarily on case prioritisation, the medical 
aspects of patient safety and continuing to improve our safety science. 
TCS is contractually required to comply with our patient safety 
standards and is closely monitored through audits against detailed 
quality and compliance performance indicators.
Environmental sustainability
Managing our environmental impact is a core commitment. In January 
2011, we implemented our new SHE strategy and associated objectives 
and targets for 2011-2015 which are closely aligned with our business 
objectives and provide the framework for driving our environmental 
sustainability going forward. This section includes summary 
information about certain key areas of the framework. Full details of 
our strategy, objectives and targets are available on our website, 
astrazeneca.com/responsibility.
We aim to minimise our environmental impact by reducing the carbon 
footprint and natural resource demands of our business activities, and 
improve the environmental profile of our products. We believe we are 
on track to deliver our 2015 targets.
We work to reduce our CO2 emissions by, among other things, 
improving our energy efficiency and pursuing lower-carbon alternatives 
to fossil fuels at our sites, and making sure that our travel and transport 
activities are as efficient as possible. Our carbon footprint is also 
affected by some of our respiratory therapies, specifically our 
AstraZeneca Annual Report and Form 20-F Information 2011
Business Review
Delivering our strategy Responsible Business 53 Delivering our strategy
pressurised metered-dose inhalers that rely on hydrofluoroalkane 
(HFA) propellants to deliver the medicine to a patient’s airways. While 
HFAs have no ozone depletion potential and a third or less of the global 
warming potential than the chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) they replace, 
they are still greenhouse gases. Our target is to reduce our operational 
greenhouse gas footprint (excluding emissions from patient use of  
our inhaler therapies) by 20% by 2015. In 2011, our greenhouse gas 
emissions (from all sources) totalled 1.17 million tonnes (35 tonnes/$m 
indexed to Group revenue).
The management of waste is another key aspect of our commitment 
and we have a 2015 target of a 15% reduction in hazardous and 
non-hazardous waste. Our primary focus is waste prevention, but 
where this is not practical, we concentrate on waste minimisation and 
appropriate treatment or disposal to maximise the reuse and recycling 
of materials and minimise disposal to landfill. In 2011, our total waste 
was 45.9 thousand tonnes (excluding our biologics capabilities) with  
a tonnes/$m index of 1.41.
We recognise the need to use water responsibly and where possible 
to minimise the use of water in our facilities. To support the delivery  
of our target to reduce water use by 25% by 2015, we now have water 
conservation plans at our largest sites. In 2011, our water use was  
4.4 million m
3
 with a m
3
/$m index of 130.
Alongside these efforts, we are also working to ensure that we 
measure and report the impact of our external manufacturing activity 
on the environment, and that our suppliers have appropriate 
environmental improvement targets.
Our continued commitment to product stewardship is underpinned  
by our ongoing work to integrate environmental considerations into  
a medicine’s complete life-cycle, from discovery and development, 
through manufacturing, marketing, use and, ultimately, disposal. 
Further information is available on our website, astrazeneca.com/
responsibility, including environmental risk assessment data for  
our medicines.
Employee safety, health and wellbeing
Providing a safe workplace and promoting the health and wellbeing  
of all our people remains a core consideration. We provide a wide 
range of health and wellbeing improvement programmes across 
AstraZeneca, designed to help people understand their personal 
health risks and support them in proactively managing these risks.
In January 2011, we implemented our new SHE strategy and a 
complementary Health and Wellbeing strategy, with associated 
objectives and targets for 2011-2015. The new targets reflect our 
determination to stay focused on continuous improvement as we  
grow and reshape our business.
Driver safety remains our highest priority for improvement and  
our focus is on promoting driver safety among our sales forces, 
collectively the single largest group of employees who drive on 
company business. Our long-standing ‘Road Scholars’ scheme in  
the US continues to be a valuable channel for building awareness  
and improving driver skills. Outside the US, our ‘Drive Success’ 
programme takes into account the different driving environments in 
the various countries in which we operate and provides a high-level 
framework of common standards and measures to be applied by 
each country. Driver safety targets are included in regional and local 
scorecards. Performance is monitored centrally to assess progress 
and identify areas for improvement. 
We regret that during 2011 one of our employees was killed in a road 
traffic accident while driving on AstraZeneca business. A detailed 
investigation was carried out, including an audit of the implementation 
of the Drive Success programme. An action plan was drawn up to 
respond to the findings of the investigation which include further 
enhancements to the Drive Success programme and increased 
communications to drivers. These actions are being tracked and 
learning will be shared widely across the business.
In 2011, we achieved a 23% improvement in the lost time injury/illness 
rate compared to the baseline year (2010), exceeding our annual 
improvement target. This puts us well on track to achieve our 2015 
target of a 25% reduction in the lost time injury/illness rate.
Work-related stress remains our greatest single category of 
occupational illness with high workloads, interpersonal issues and 
organisational change identified as significant factors. As part of our 
ongoing efforts in this area, we are adopting an increasingly proactive, 
risk-based approach, using wellbeing risk assessment tools to identify 
high-risk areas and target interventions more effectively.
Community investment
Wherever AstraZeneca operates worldwide, we aim to make a  
positive contribution to our local communities through partnerships, 
charitable donations and other initiatives that help to make a 
sustainable difference. Our investment is focused on improving  
health and promoting science skills.
In 2011, we spent a total of $1.27 billion (2010: $1.41 billion) on 
community sponsorships, partnerships and charitable donations 
worldwide, including our product donation and patient assistance 
programmes which make our medicines available free of charge or  
at reduced prices. Through our three patient assistance programmes 
in the US we donated products valued at an average wholesale price  
of over $938 million (2010: $1.38 billion). We also donated products 
worth $8.2 million, valued at average wholesale price, to the charitable 
organisations: Americares and Direct Relief International.
Disaster relief
During 2011, we made a number of contributions to disaster relief 
efforts, including donations from our Charities Aid Foundation (CAF) 
account. We also developed an enhanced protocol for working with 
the British Red Cross, our global disaster relief partner, to improve our 
internal coordination and enable us to respond in a timely, consistent 
and effective way to emergencies as and when they arise. This 
protocol was used to inform the following contributions to disaster 
relief efforts during the year. 
>  In February 2011, we donated £10,000 (approximately $16,000) 
from our CAF account to the British Red Cross New Zealand 
Earthquake Appeal. In March 2011, we donated £100,000 
(approximately $162,000) from our CAF account to the British  
Red Cross Libya and Region Appeal to help support those who  
had fled to neighbouring countries to escape the violence in Libya. 
>  Following the earthquake in Japan, we donated 51 million Yen 
(approximately $640,000) as part of an overall pledge of 100 million 
Yen (approximately $1.3 million) to Ashinaga Ikueikai in support  
of their ongoing relief and rebuilding effort. In addition, employee 
donations from AstraZeneca in Japan totalling 25.5 million Yen 
(approximately $320,000) were matched by the Company.  
We donated $25,000 to AMREF to support their local networks  
in North East Kenya, where the Horn of Africa drought was having  
a devastating impact.

Raising breast cancer awareness 
and improving treatment
Named after the Zulu word for ‘rise’ or ‘uplifting’, our Phakamisa partnership brings  
together different organisations to help raise breast cancer awareness, increase  
early diagnosis, and improve access to treatment and effective support networks  
in communities across South Africa. 
Breast cancer is the most common cancer among women in 
South Africa and is on the increase. Every year, 1 in 29 women 
will be diagnosed with the disease. Many more go undiagnosed 
and a lot of women are unable to afford or access treatment.
Phakamisa helps in three ways. First, we are ensuring that our 
hormonal treatments are made available to the health service 
cost effectively. Secondly, in collaboration with South Africa’s 
Foundation for Professional Development, we are providing 
accredited courses in cancer diagnosis, treatment and care to 
doctors, nurses and other healthcare professionals. Finally, with 
the help of the Cancer Association of South Africa and the Breast 
Health Foundation, we are training teams of volunteers and 
counsellors to raise awareness and support patients. 
In 2011, 100 doctors and nurses and 400 volunteers and 
counsellors were trained.

>  Results from the SATURN study published in November did not 
demonstrate a statistically significant greater reduction in favour 
of Crestor versus atorvastatin for the reduction of atherosclerotic 
plaque (percent atheroma volume) on the primary endpoint even 
though the reduction was numerically greater. For the secondary 
efficacy measure of normalised total atheroma volume, Crestor 
demonstrated a statistically significant reduction compared with 
atorvastatin. Statistically significant differences were observed in 
favour of Crestor for key lipid parameters, and, once again, the 
study demonstrated that Crestor helps to reduce plaque build-up 
in the arteries.

AstraZeneca Annual Report and Form 20-F Information 2011 58 Therapy Area Review Cardiovascular Our strategic objectives
AstraZeneca is one of the world leaders in cardiovascular (CV) 
medicines. We aim to build on our strong position, focusing on the 
growth areas of atherosclerosis (hardening of the arteries), thrombosis 
(blood clotting), diabetes, obesity and atrial fibrillation (cardiac 
arrhythmia). Despite improvements in the quality of diagnosis and 
treatment, the unmet medical needs remain high and these disease 
areas, and their complications, continue to grow worldwide (both in 
Established Markets and Emerging Markets) as a consequence of the 
spread of a westernised lifestyle.
In addition to our small-molecule CV research, we are developing 
potential new therapies using a variety of biologic approaches, 
including antibodies, peptides and proteins, to address unmet medical 
needs in the treatment of obesity, diabetes and heart disease. 
Cardiovascular diseases 
Hypertension (high blood pressure) and dyslipidaemia (abnormal  
levels of blood cholesterol) damage the arterial wall which may lead  
to atherosclerosis. CV events driven by atherosclerotic disease remain 
the leading cause of death in the western world. Lipid-modifying 
therapy, primarily statins, is a cornerstone for the treatment of 
atherosclerosis.
Acute coronary syndromes (ACS) is an umbrella term for sudden 
chest pain and other symptoms due to insufficient blood supply 
(ischaemia) to the heart muscle. ACS is the acute culmination of 
ischemic heart disease, the leading cause of death worldwide  
(WHO 2008). There remains a significant need to improve outcomes 
and reduce the costs of treating ACS.
Our focus
Our key marketed products 
Since its launch in 2003, Crestor has continued to gain market 
share, with its differentiated profile in managing cholesterol levels  
and its more recent label indications for slowing the progression of 
atherosclerosis and reducing the risk of CV events in some markets. 
Crestor is the only statin with an atherosclerosis indication in the 
US which is not limited by disease severity or restricted to patients 
with coronary heart disease. A competitor to Crestor, atorvastatin 
(Lipitor™), was available in generic form in the US from late 2011.
Fewer than half the people thought to have high levels of low-density 
lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL -C) ‘bad cholesterol’ are diagnosed and 
treated. Of treated patients, only about half reach their doctors’ 
recommended cholesterol targets using existing treatments. Study 
data has shown that the usual 10mg starting dose of Crestor is more 
effective at lowering LDL -C and produces greater achievement of 
LDL -C goals than commonly prescribed doses of other statins. 
Crestor also produces an increase in high-density lipoprotein 
cholesterol (HDL -C) ‘good cholesterol’ across the dose range, and  
has again been shown to reduce atherosclerotic plaque in the recently 
published SATURN study.
Brilinta/Brilique (ticagrelor) is an oral antiplatelet treatment for ACS in 
a new chemical class called cyclo-pentyl-triazolo-pyrimidines which 
are selective adenosine diphospate (ADP) receptor antagonists that 
act on the P2Y12 ADP-receptor. Brilinta was approved by the FDA in 
July to reduce the rate of heart attack (myocardial infarction) and CV 
death in adult patients with ACS, compared to clopidogrel. The FDA 
approval is based upon data from the PLATO study, a superiority trial 
that compared treatment with Brilinta to clopidogrel, when added to 
aspirin, in 18,624 ACS patients worldwide. The overall PLATO results 
demonstrated the superiority of ticagrelor versus clopidogrel in 
reducing heart attacks and CV death in patients with ACS treated  
for 12 months without increasing major or fatal bleeding. The study 
provided the basis for regulatory filings worldwide.
In September, Brilique (the trade name for ticagrelor in Europe) 
received final guidance from The National Institute for Health and 
Clinical Excellence (NICE) in the UK, for reimbursement in patients  
with ACS who have suffered a heart attack or an episode of unstable 
angina. In October, the final positive Technology Appraisal Guidance 
(TAG) from NICE was published. In December, Brilique received a 
positive final medical benefit assessment for the majority of ACS 
patients in Germany from the Federal Joint Committee as part of the 
new AMNOG (Arzneimittelmarkt-Neuordnungsgesetz) review process.

Business Review
Therapy Area Review Cardiovascular 59 Therapy Area Review
In September, we announced the European Society of Cardiology 
(ESC) included Brilique on their non-ST elevation myocardial infarction 
(NSTEMI) guidelines in a 1st line position ahead of clopidogrel. This 
supports its earlier inclusion in the ESC/EACTS revascularisation 
guidelines in 2010. 
In November, Brilinta received a Class I recommendation in the 
updated percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) guidelines from  
the American Heart Association (AHA), the American College of 
Cardiology Foundation (ACCF) and the Society for Cardiovascular 
Angiography and Interventions (SCAI). That month Brilinta was also 
added to the updated AHA/ACCF Coronary Artery Bypass Graft 
(CABG) and Secondary Prevention & Risk Reduction Guidelines. 
Brilinta/Brilique remains under regulatory review in 39 countries. It has 
been approved in 64 countries, including in the US, Canada and Brazil 
under the trade name Brilinta and in the EU, Iceland and Norway, 
under the trade name Brilique. Additional marketing authorisations 
and regulatory submissions are planned for 2012.
Atacand continues to be an important treatment option for patients 
with hypertension and symptomatic heart failure. Atacand is approved 
for the treatment of hypertension in over 125 countries and for 
symptomatic heart failure in more than 70 countries. Most patients 
with hypertension fail to reach their treatment goals with the use of  
a single anti-hypertensive treatment and fixed dose combinations of 
two or more anti-hypertensives are commonly prescribed for patients 
to improve efficacy and attainment of treatment goals. Atacand Plus 
(candesartan cilexetil/hydrochlorothiazide) is a fixed dose combination 
of Atacand and the diuretic hydrochlorothiazide, indicated for the 
treatment of hypertension in patients who require more than one 
anti-hypertensive therapy. Atacand Plus is approved in 98 countries.
Axanum is a single capsule of low-dose ASA and esomeprazole (the 
active ingredient in Nexium). It is indicated for prevention of CV events 
in high-risk CV patients in need of daily low-dose ASA treatment and 
who are at risk of gastric ulcers. Low-dose ASA is a mainstay of 
therapy for patients at high risk of having a CV event such as a heart 
attack or stroke. Up to 30% of patients with upper gastrointestinal 
problems discontinue or take deliberate breaks from their low-dose 
ASA treatment, placing them at risk of a potentially life-threatening  
CV event as early as eight to 10 days after discontinuation. 
In May, AstraZeneca received a Complete Response Letter from the 
FDA for the NDA for Axanum. AstraZeneca has worked with the FDA 
and provided additional information. Due to the time delay caused by 
the Complete Response Letter and the additional review, AstraZeneca 
has decided to withdraw the NDA for Axanum.
In August, Axanum received positive agreement for approval in 23 
European member states and in Norway. Axanum has been approved 
in 13 of these countries and its first market launch occurred in 
Germany in November.
Clinical studies of our key marketed products 
GALAXY, our long-term global clinical research programme for 
Crestor, investigates links between optimal lipid control, atherosclerosis 
and CV morbidity and mortality. The programme has completed a 
number of studies involving over 65,000 patients in over 55 countries, 
some of which are referred to below.
The SATURN study was designed to measure the impact of Crestor 
40mg and atorvastatin (Lipitor™) 80mg on the progression of 
atherosclerosis in high-risk patients. Results from the SATURN study 
published in November did not demonstrate a statistically significant 
greater reduction in favour of Crestor versus atorvastatin (Lipitor™) 
on the primary endpoint of percent atheroma volume, even though  
the reduction was numerically greater. For the secondary efficacy

measure of normalised total atheroma volume (TAV), Crestor 
demonstrated a statistically significant reduction compared with 
atorvastatin (Lipitor™). Statistically significant differences were 
observed in favour of Crestor for key lipid parameters, and, once 
again, the study demonstrated that Crestor helps to reduce plaque 
build-up in the arteries. 
In October 2010, AstraZeneca initiated PEGASUS TIMI-54, a 21,000 
patient study in over 30 countries. The study examines the ability  
of Brilinta/Brilique plus aspirin to prevent adverse CV events safely 
compared to aspirin alone in higher-risk patients one to three years 
after a heart attack. Enrolment for PEGASUS began in December 
2010 and is ongoing. 
The ATLANTIC trial started recruitment in September and is designed 
to examine the efficacy of pre-hospital (eg ambulance) versus 
in-hospital administration of Brilinta/Brilique co-administered with 
aspirin in approximately 1,770 patients presenting with one type of 
heart attack called ST-elevated myocardial infarction (STEMI). The aim 
of this study is to determine whether initiation of Brilinta/Brilique as 
early as possible can lead to improved outcomes for these patients.
Diabetes 
Type 2 diabetes is a chronic progressive disease and patients often 
require multiple medications to control their condition. The disease 
continues to grow as a consequence of western lifestyles and it 
increasingly affects people at a younger age. There are a number of 
established oral generic and branded classes, such as biguanides and 
sulfonylureas. However, newer classes such as oral dipeptidyl peptidase 
IV (DPP-IV) inhibitors are successfully entering the market by offering 
effective blood sugar control and improved tolerability. Several new 
classes of drugs are in development in this area, including sodium-
glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT2). CV safety has been given 
particular emphasis in recent regulatory reviews and guidance 
documents provided by the FDA and other regulatory authorities. 
Our focus
Our key marketed products 
AstraZeneca continues its strong worldwide
1
 collaboration with 
BMS to develop and commercialise two compounds discovered by 
BMS (Onglyza™ (saxagliptin) and dapagliflozin) for the treatment of  
Type 2 diabetes.
Onglyza™ has been submitted for regulatory review in more than 90 
countries and approved in 68, including the US, Canada, Mexico, 30 
European countries, India, Brazil and China. In March 2011, Onglyza™ 
became the first DPP-IV inhibitor available for use in Europe in Type 2 
diabetes patients with moderate or severe renal impairment. This 
followed the European Commission’s approval of a label update for 
Onglyza™ in the treatment of adults with Type 2 diabetes who have 
moderate or severe renal impairment. The approved dosage for this 
patient group is a once-daily 2.5mg dose.
In November, AstraZeneca and BMS were granted approval from  
the European Commission for the marketing authorisation for 
Komboglyze™ (a fixed dose combination of Onglyza™ and metformin 
immediate release tablets) as a treatment for adults with Type 2 
diabetes. The decision applies to the 27 member states of the EU. 
This followed FDA approval in November 2010 for Kombiglyze XR™,  
a fixed dose combination of Onglyza™ plus metformin hydrochloride 
extended-release tablets. Kombiglyze XR™ is the first and only 
once-a-day metformin extended release plus DPP-IV inhibitor 
combination tablet providing strong comprehensive glycaemic control 
across glycosylated haemoglobin levels (HbA1c), fasting plasma 
glucose and post-prandial glucose. Kombiglyze XR™ was launched  
in January 2011 in the US. 
AstraZeneca Annual Report and Form 20-F Information 2011 60 Therapy Area Review Cardiovascular In the pipeline 
Dapagliflozin, an investigational compound, is a potential first-in-class 
SGLT2 inhibitor under joint development with BMS as a once-daily 
oral therapy for the treatment of adult patients with Type 2 diabetes.  
In March 2011, the FDA accepted for review the NDA filed by 
AstraZeneca and BMS for dapagliflozin as a once-daily oral therapy 
for the treatment of adult patients with Type 2 diabetes. In June, 
AstraZeneca and BMS announced the results of two Phase III trials 
that showed that dapagliflozin treatment was effective in lowering 
blood glucose and body weight as initial combination therapy with 
metformin in drug-naïve Type 2 diabetes patients with poor glycemic 
control. In addition, long-term (102 week) data from double-blind 
extensions of two Phase III studies in Type 2 diabetes patients showed 
that improvements in blood glucose lowering and weight loss were 
maintained over two years for dapagliflozin added to metformin.  
In July, AstraZeneca and BMS reported the outcome of the FDA 
Advisory Committee meeting on the NDA. On the question ‘Do the 
efficacy and safety data provide substantial evidence to support 
approval of dapagliflozin as an adjunct to diet and exercise to  
improve glycemic control in adults with Type 2 diabetes mellitus?’,  
the committee voted against recommending approval by nine ‘no’ 
votes to six ‘yes’. AstraZeneca and BMS subsequently submitted 
additional clinical data to support the FDA’s review of dapagliflozin. 
This submission represented a major amendment to the NDA and 
resulted in a three-month extension to the PDUFA action date to 
January 2012. 
In January 2012, AstraZeneca and BMS received a Complete 
Response Letter from the FDA requesting additional clinical data to 
allow a better assessment of the benefit/risk profile for dapagliflozin. 
This includes clinical trial data from ongoing studies and may require 
information from new clinical trials. AstraZeneca and BMS will work 
closely with the FDA to determine the appropriate next steps for the 
dapagliflozin application and remain committed to its development.
In November, AstraZeneca and BMS announced results from a 
pre-specified meta-analysis of CV safety data from 14 Phase IIb/III 
trials in adult patients with Type 2 diabetes. These showed that 
dapagliflozin was not associated with an unacceptable increase in  
CV risk relative to all comparators pooled in the clinical programme. 
The review of the MAA for dapagliflozin in the EU is in progress with  
a decision expected by the second quarter of 2012.
Our activities in the glucokinase activator area were discontinued 
during 2011 based on Phase IIb data not showing results supporting 
the intended target product profile (TPP). In addition, during 2011,  
we discontinued AZD8329 and AZD7687 due to clinical results not 
supporting the intended TPP. In 2011, AZD2820 was initiated in clinical 
testing for the treatment of obesity.
Atrial fibrillation 
Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common cardiac arrhythmia. 
Rhythm-control therapy to manage the symptoms of AF is dominated 
by generic amiodarone, which is effective at maintaining patients  
in normal heart rhythm but very poorly tolerated. AF is associated  
with an increased risk of cerebral embolism resulting in stroke and 
disability. To reduce the risk of such AF-related complications, 
anti-coagulation with vitamin K antagonists can be used. New 
anti-coagulation therapies with improved convenience are emerging.
In the pipeline 
For the control of heart rhythm in AF, our focus is on atrial-specific 
agents as a way to reduce the risk of pro-arrhythmic effects. Our 
activities in this area are primarily in preclinical development, with 
AZD2927 recently entering Phase II.

generic, decreased by 29% to $689 million as a result of further 
generic competition, although this was partially offset by 13%  
growth in Emerging Markets to $391 million.
Atacand sales were up 3%, despite US sales being down 18%, as 
a result of strong growth in Established ROW (8%) and Emerging 
Markets (17%).
Alliance revenue from the Onglyza™ collaboration with BMS totalled 
$69 million, comprising $54 million in the US and $15 million in  
other markets.

AstraZeneca Annual Report and Form 20-F Information 2011 62 Therapy Area Review Gastrointestinal Our strategic objectives
We aim to develop our position in gastrointestinal (GI) treatments by 
continuing to focus on our existing proton pump inhibitors (PPIs).
Our focus
Our key marketed products
Nexium is marketed in approximately 120 countries and is available in 
oral (tablet/capsules and oral suspension) and intravenous (i.v.) dosage 
forms for the treatment of acid-related diseases. Nexium is an effective 
short-term and long-term therapy for patients with GERD. In the US, 
the EU and other markets Nexium is approved for use in children 
from the age of one year for the treatment of GERD. In December,  
the FDA approved Nexium for delayed-release oral suspension for 
the treatment of erosive esophagitis due to acid-mediated GERD in 
patients aged one month to less than one year. In the EU, Nexium in 
combination with antibiotics is also approved for use for the treatment 
of duodenal ulcers caused by Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection  
in children from the age of four years. In the EU and other markets, 
Nexium is approved for the healing and prevention of ulcers associated 
with NSAID therapy, including cyclooxygenase 2 selective inhibitors.  
In the US, Nexium is approved for reducing the risk of gastric ulcers 
associated with continuous NSAID therapy in patients at risk of 
developing gastric ulcers. Nexium is also approved in the US, the EU, 
Canada and Australia for the treatment of patients with the rare gastric 
disorder, Zollinger-Ellison syndrome.
In September, AstraZeneca launched Nexium 10mg and 20mg 
capsules in Japan for the treatment of acid-related conditions including 
NERD, reflux esophagitis and PUD, following regulatory approval in 
July. Nexium also received regulatory approval for prevention of 
recurrence of gastric ulcer and duodenal ulcer in patients treated with 
NSAIDs. AstraZeneca and Daiichi Sankyo will co-promote Nexium 
in Japan under the terms of a 2010 agreement. AstraZeneca will 
manufacture and develop the product and Daiichi Sankyo will be 
responsible for its distribution.
Following treatment with Nexium i.v., oral Nexium is approved in 
the EU and other markets for the maintenance of haemostasis and 
prevention of re-bleeding of gastric or duodenal ulcers.
Nexium i.v. is used when oral administration is not suitable for the 
treatment of GERD and upper GI side effects induced by NSAIDs. It is 
approved in the EU and other markets for the short-term maintenance 
of haemostasis and prevention of re-bleeding in patients following 
therapeutic endoscopy for acute bleeding gastric or duodenal ulcers. 
Nexium i.v. is approved for use in children from one year in the EU and 
from age one month in the US.
In May 2010, AstraZeneca received a Complete Response Letter for 
the sNDA for Nexium which was submitted for the risk reduction of 
low-dose aspirin-associated peptic ulcers. AstraZeneca has worked 
with the FDA and provided additional information. Due to the time 
delay caused by the Complete Response Letter and subsequent 
review, AstraZeneca withdrew the sNDA in the US in May. 
Losec/Prilosec was first launched in 1988 and is approved for the 
treatment of GERD. We continue to maintain certain patent property 
covering Losec/Prilosec. Losec/Prilosec is available both as a 
prescription-only medication and, in some countries, as an OTC 
medication where it offers consumers a more effective self-medication 
option for the treatment of heartburn compared with antacids and H2 
receptor antagonists.
In the pipeline 
Our activities in the field of reflux inhibition and hypersensitivity therapy 
have been discontinued. We have commenced work with IL -13 
inhibition in ulcerative colitis.

AstraZeneca Annual Report and Form 20-F Information 2011 64 Therapy Area Review Infection Our strategic objectives
We aim to build a leading franchise in the treatment of infectious 
diseases through continued commercialisation of brands such as 
Synagis, Merrem/Meronem, FluMist/Fluenz and Cubicin™, as well 
as through the development of pipeline products such as Zinforo 
(ceftaroline). We also aim to make effective use of our structural and 
genomic-based discovery technologies and antibody platforms, 
vaccines and continued small molecule and biologics research into 
novel approaches in areas of unmet medical needs. Complementing 
our biologics capabilities, we are actively evaluating and integrating 
small molecule anti-RSV and anti-influenza basic research into our 
overall anti-viral approach.
Respiratory syncytial virus 
Approximately half of all infants are infected with RSV during the first 
year of life and nearly all children in the US have been infected by the 
time they reach their second birthday. RSV is the most common virus 
that causes lung and airway infections in infants and young children. 
Premature babies (earlier than 36 weeks gestational age, especially 
those less than 32 weeks) and babies with chronic lung disease or 
congenital heart disease are at increased risk of contracting severe 
RSV disease than full-term healthy babies.
Our focus
Our key marketed products 
Synagis is used for the prevention of serious lower respiratory 
tract disease caused by RSV in children at high risk of the disease.  
It was the first MAb approved in the US for an infectious disease  
and has become the global standard of care for RSV prevention. 
Approved in 81 countries worldwide, Synagis remains the only 
immunoprophylaxis in the marketplace indicated for the prevention  
of RSV in paediatric patients at high risk of RSV. Synagis is 
administered by intra-muscular injection.
In the pipeline 
We are developing a live intranasal vaccine for the prevention of lower 
respiratory tract illness caused by RSV in otherwise healthy infants. 
Two vaccine candidates are in clinical development MEDI-559 and 
MEDI-534.
Serious bacterial infections
World demand for antibiotics and novel therapeutic approaches 
remains high and will continue to grow due to escalating resistance 
and the increased risk of serious infections in both immuno-
suppressed patients and ageing populations. Many bacterial infections 
currently have few satisfactory treatment options prompting demand 
for new and better therapies.
Our focus
Our key marketed products 
Merrem/Meronem remains the leading carbapenem anti-bacterial 
across a significant number of AstraZeneca’s licensed territories in 
which it is sold, except for the US (36% value share of the carbapenem 
market). Merrem/Meronem maintains a 6% share of the global 
intravenous antibiotic market (by value), despite experiencing loss of  
US market exclusivity in June 2010. Continued generic growth across 
the carbapenem class is anticipated over the next 12 months following 
the launches of numerous generics across Europe and the US.
Cubicin™ is used for the treatment of serious gram-positive infections  
in hospitalised patients and is sold by AstraZeneca in selected territories 
in Asia, Europe and the Middle East. Cubicin™ was submitted for 
marketing approval by the SFDA in China in September for the 
additional indication of complicated skin and skin structure infections.
In the pipeline 
Zinforo (ceftaroline) is a novel injectable cephalosporin, which is being 
developed in collaboration with Forest. Zinforo is effective against 
gram-positive organisms and commonly susceptible gram-negative 
organisms associated with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) 
and complicated skin and soft tissue infections (CSSTI). In particular, 
Zinforo is active against methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus 
(MRSA). Forest received FDA approval for ceftaroline in October 2010 
in the US for the treatment of acute bacterial skin and skin structure 
infections and community-acquired bacterial pneumonia caused by 
designated susceptible bacteria. Forest launched in March 2011 under 
the brand name Teflaro™ (ceftaroline). AstraZeneca is responsible for 
registration and marketing outside the US, Canada and Japan and 
filed an MAA for the 27 member states of the EU in December 2010. 
Further submissions in other jurisdictions continued in 2011. 
Following the acquisition of Novexel in 2010 we are working with 
Forest on future joint global development programmes, including  
CAZ AVI (a combination of ceftazidime and avibactam, formerly  
known as CAZ104) and CXL (a combination of ceftaroline and 
avibactam, formerly known as CXL104/CEF104). The CAZ AVI  
Phase III programme was initiated in 2011 and includes five trials to 
confirm the efficacy and tolerability of CAZ AVI in adult patients with 
complicated intra-abdominal or complicated urinary tract infections. 
Patients with infections which are resistant to commonly used 
antibiotics will also be included in the Phase III programme. CXL  
is in Phase II development for serious infections where coverage 
against resistant strains is required.
To meet the high and growing need for new and better therapies for 
resistant bacterial infections we have built an anti-bacterials discovery 
capability to ensure that AstraZeneca has the resources to create 
novel mechanism anti-bacterials. Out of this work, a candidate 
anti-bacterial drug, AZD5099, with a novel mechanism of action 
involving inhibition of bacterial DNA gyrase, started single ascending 
dose Phase I studies in healthy volunteers in June. We are also actively 
evaluating and integrating biologics anti-bacterial modalities (MAbs 
and vaccines) into our overall approach to dealing with serious 
bacterial infection challenges.
Influenza virus
Influenza is the most common vaccine-preventable disease in the 
developed world. According to WHO estimates, seasonal influenza 
results in three to five million cases of severe illness and up to half a 
million deaths globally each year, primarily among the elderly. Rates  
of infection are highest among children, with school-aged children 
significantly contributing to the spread of the disease. 
Our focus
Our key marketed products 
FluMist is a trivalent live, attenuated nasally delivered vaccine 
approved for the prevention of disease caused by influenza virus 
subtypes A and B in eligible children and adults. FluMist is now 
approved for eligible individuals in seven countries including the US, 
Canada and Brazil.
In February 2011, the European Commission granted marketing 
authorisation to Fluenz (the trade name for FluMist in the EU), for the 
prevention of seasonal influenza for children 24 months to less than  
18 years of age. The decision is applicable to the 27 EU member 
states and the European Economic Area. It is expected that the Fluenz 
vaccine will be initially available in select European markets for the 
2012/2013 influenza season.

lineages of influenza. The PDUFA date is 29 February 2012 and,  
if approved, launches are anticipated in the US for the 2013-2014 
influenza season. 
It is anticipated that the MAA and other regulatory submissions for 
MEDI-3250 will be made from the third quarter of 2012 onwards. 
Sepsis 
Sepsis is a life-threatening condition resulting from uncontrolled severe 
infections. It remains a significant problem in medical management, 
with approximately three million worldwide incidents annually and a 
30% mortality rate. Current treatment options for patients with severe 
sepsis or septic shock are extremely limited and, although industry 
pipelines are focused on the development of products specifically  
for registration for the treatment of sepsis or septic shock, there are 
few products in late stage development.
In the pipeline 
Our potential treatment for severe sepsis licensed from Protherics  
Inc. (now part of the BTG plc group) AZD9773 (formerly known as 
CytoFab™), is an anti-TNF α polyclonal antibody fragment and 
continues in Phase II development with two studies: a global 
300-patient Phase IIb study (still recruiting) and a small Phase II  
study in Japan for which recruitment is complete. AZD9773 has  
the potential to be one of a limited number of medicines specifically 
developed for patients with severe sepsis.
Tuberculosis 
Tuberculosis (TB) remains a worldwide threat and is newly  
diagnosed in over eight million people worldwide every year. It is  
one of the greatest causes of death from infectious disease in the 
developing world. 
As part of our commitment to make a contribution to improving  
health in the developing world, we are working to find new, improved 
treatments for TB. Work ongoing at our research facility in Bangalore, 
India focuses on finding drugs that will act on multi-resistant strains, 
will simplify the treatment in (current regimens are complex and 
lengthy, meaning many patients give up before the infection is fully 
treated) and will be compatible with HIV/AIDS therapies (TB and HIV/
AIDS form a lethal combination, each speeding the other’s progress). 
Bangalore scientists work closely with our infection research centre in 
Boston, US as well as with academic leaders in the field, and have full 
access to all AstraZeneca’s platform technologies, such as ‘high 
throughput screening’ and compound libraries.
TB remains a complex research area in which collaborations play  
a very important role. Our discovery collaboration with the Global 
Alliance for TB Drug Development continues to work towards 
progressing suitable compounds through to the lead optimisation 
stage. Research funded by a Wellcome Trust grant under the ‘R&D  
for Affordable Healthcare in India’ initiative, which will be used to 
identify novel lead molecules for the treatment of TB, continues.  
Our most advanced programme, AZD5847 (a novel anti-tubercular 
oxazolidinone antibiotic), has completed its Phase I programme and  
is expected to enter Phase IIa trials with support from The National 
Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases in 2012.

through further growth of Seroquel IR and Seroquel XR and to 
discover and develop new drug candidates with meaningful

pain control and cognition.
Psychiatry 
The depression market is currently dominated by selective serotonin 
re-uptake inhibitors and serotonin norepinephrine re-uptake inhibitors. 
With increasing payer pressure and the need to demonstrate clear 
value, new medicines must either show superior efficacy over current 
treatments, or clear efficacy in well-defined patient segments, such  
as treatment-resistant depression. We continue to pursue projects in 
clinical development to address current unmet medical needs. While 
no further internal discovery projects are planned, we continue to 
pursue additional opportunities through external alliances.
Our focus
Our key marketed products 
Seroquel IR is an atypical anti-psychotic drug with anti-depressant 
properties. It is approved for the treatment of adult schizophrenia  
and bipolar disorder (mania, depression and maintenance). Its overall 
clinical efficacy and tolerability profile make it one of the leading 
atypical anti-psychotics in terms of global value share in the atypical 
anti-psychotic market segment. In the US, Seroquel IR is also 
approved for treatment of acute manic episodes in bipolar disorder  
in children and adolescents ages 10 to 17 years and for schizophrenia 
in adolescents ages 13 to 17 years.
To date, Seroquel XR has been approved in 76 countries for 
schizophrenia, 66 countries for bipolar mania, 55 countries for bipolar 
depression, 41 countries for bipolar maintenance, 42 countries for 
major depressive disorder (MDD) and six countries for generalised 
anxiety disorder (GAD). Following referral to the CHMP, Seroquel XR 
was approved as an add-on treatment for major depressive episodes 
in patients with MDD who have had sub-optimal response to 
anti-depressant monotherapy.
In the pipeline 
In September, the last patient was enrolled in the RENAISSANCE 
programme for TC-5214, the Phase III trial designed to support  
an NDA filing in the US planned for the second half of 2012 and  
an MAA filing in Europe planned for 2015 for TC-5214 as an  
adjunctive treatment for MDD. TC-5214, a nicotinic modulator, is  
being co-developed with Targacept. The first two of these Phase III 
studies did not meet their primary endpoints after eight weeks of 
treatment with TC-5214 as compared to placebo. Two additional 
Phase III efficacy and tolerability studies and one long-term safety 
study are ongoing. Regulatory filing targets for TC-5214 will be 
reviewed following full results of the remaining studies which are 
expected in the first half of 2012. In February 2011, the first patients 
were enrolled in a multinational Phase IIb clinical trial of TC-5214  
as a switch monotherapy treatment for patients with MDD with 
inadequate response to initial antidepressant therapy.
AZD6765 has progressed into Phase IIb development to address  
the needs of patients with severe treatment-resistant depression. 
Development of AZD2066 has been discontinued.
Analgesia and anaesthesia (pain control)
The small number of currently approved products in the neuropathic 
pain market will become generic between 2014 and 2017. However, 
few new products are in development and the unmet medical need for 
improvements in both efficacy and tolerability is such that the market 
remains highly attractive. In Asia, neuropathic pain drugs are gaining 
approval, shifting cultural and medical treatment barriers. It is believed 
that advances in the understanding of the mechanisms which lead  
to neuropathic pain will allow for improved patient segmentation, 
potentially increasing the success rate of research in this condition.
The chronic nociceptive pain market, including osteoarthritis (OA) and 
chronic low back pain, is steadily growing due to ageing populations 
combined with longer life expectancy across all regions, including 
Asia. Opioids are considered the gold standard for efficacy for 
moderate to severe pain across pain segments. However, opioid pain 
control comes with unwanted side effects such as bowel dysfunction. 
There remains a high unmet medical need for products that enable 
continued opioid pain control by reducing or eliminating side effects. 
Led by the anti-nerve growth factor MAbs, biologics are an emerging 
treatment option for pain control and this is an area in which we have 
an active interest through our biologics capabilities.

Therapy Area Review
AstraZeneca Annual Report and Form 20-F Information 2011 68 Therapy Area Review Neuroscience Our focus
Our key marketed products 
Vimovo (naproxen/esomeprazole magnesium), 375/20-500/20mg 
delayed-release tablets, co-developed by AstraZeneca and Pozen, is 
a fixed dose combination of enteric-coated naproxen (an NSAID), and 
immediate-release esomeprazole, a stomach acid-reducing proton 
pump inhibitor (PPI). Vimovo is generally approved for symptomatic 
relief in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA), osteoarthritis (OA) 
and ankylosing spondylitis (AS), in patients at risk of developing 
NSAID-associated gastric and/or duodenal ulcers. The approved  
use for Vimovo varies based on territory. 
Following FDA approval in April 2010, Vimovo launched in the US 
in July 2010. In October, Vimovo received positive agreement for 
approval in 23 European member states. In the EU, Vimovo is 
indicated for the symptomatic treatment of OA, RA and AS in patients 
who are at risk of developing NSAID-associated gastric and/or 
duodenal ulcers and where treatment with lower doses of naproxen  
or of other NSAIDs is not considered sufficient. We are now  
pursuing pricing and reimbursement and national approvals in  
each EU member state. Vimovo is now available in every region 
around the world.
In the pipeline 
In March 2011, the first patients were enrolled in the Phase III KODIAC 
programme for NKTR-118, an oral peripherally-acting opioid antagonist 
being investigated for the treatment of opioid-induced constipation 
(OIC), a common gastrointestinal side effect of prescription opioids 
when used for chronic pain management. The Phase III programme  
is designed to investigate the safety and efficacy of NKTR-118 as a 
medicine to relieve OIC, and global submissions are anticipated for 
mid-2013. NKTR-118 is part of the exclusive worldwide licence 
agreement announced in September 2009, between AstraZeneca 
and Nektar Therapeutics. 
AZD2423 continues in Phase IIa studies for the treatment of 
neuropathic pain. 
Cognition 
Alzheimer’s disease (AD) remains one of the largest areas of unmet 
medical need and of high risk for neuroscience product development, 
due in part to the challenges of establishing efficacy in clinical studies. 
Current treatments, which doctors consider inadequate, target the 
symptoms, not the underlying cause, of the disease. This area 
continues to grow, but all existing marketed treatments will face patent 
expiry by 2015. Disease modification, delivered through biologics  
and/or small molecule treatments, is clearly the hope for AD patients. 
Along with better diagnostics, it is expected to allow for earlier 
intervention and better clinical outcomes, but the first wave of disease 
modifiers is still several years away.
In the pipeline 
Compounds in Phase II development include products deriving from 
our relationship with Targacept (AZD3480 and AZD1446). AZD3480, 
an α4ß2 neuronal nicotinic receptor (NNR) agonist, is currently in 
Phase IIb clinical testing for AD, conducted by Targacept. AZD1446 
has completed Phase I and a Phase IIa trial in AD patients is planned  
in 2012. The option on the Targacept compound, TC-5619 (an α7 
NNR agonist), was not exercised following the completion of Phase IIa 
studies, in cognitive disorders in schizophrenia and attention deficit 
hyperactivity disorder.
Through our collaboration with the Karolinska Institute in Sweden,  
the Banner Alzheimer’s Institute in the US, the National Institute of 
Radiological Sciences in Japan and others, our R&D capabilities in 
positron emission tomography (PET) imaging of the human brain 
continues to progress. AstraZeneca’s amyloid PET ligands may 
enable us to detect AD early and to assess drug effects in AD.  
We have discovered and taken into patient studies one F-18 and two  
C-11 amyloid PET ligands which are being developed as research 
biomarkers. AZD4694, a radioligand currently in Phase II studies, has 
been out-licensed to Navidea Biopharmaceuticals (formerly Neoprobe 
Corp.) for Phase III development and commercialisation. 
An alliance with the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine 
aims to generate new AD drug candidates for the clinical development 
pipeline. In this collaboration, researchers focus on the protein tau, 
which is a key component of neurofibrillary tangles that characterise AD.

AstraZeneca Annual Report and Form 20-F Information 2011 70 Therapy Area Review Oncology Our strategic objectives
We aim to build on our position as one of the world leaders in cancer 
treatment with established brands such as Zoladex and Arimidex and 
growing brands such as Faslodex and Iressa. Our future growth will 
be driven through targeting the right treatments, both small molecules 
and biologics, to the right patients, using companion diagnostics 
where appropriate. This approach is driving the growth of Iressa and 
is a key focus in the development of our early stage portfolio.
Our focus
Our key marketed products 
Arimidex, first launched in 1995, remains a leading hormonal therapy 
for patients with early breast cancer globally. This success is largely 
based on the extensive long-term efficacy and safety results of the 
ATAC study, which showed Arimidex to be significantly superior to 
tamoxifen at preventing breast cancer recurrence during and beyond 
the five-year treatment course. 
Faslodex 500mg is now approved in many markets including the EU, 
the US and Japan. It offers an additional, efficacious, hormonal 
therapy option for patients with hormone-receptor positive advanced 
breast cancer. It is given by once-monthly injections and is approved 
for the treatment of hormone-receptor positive advanced breast 
cancer in post-menopausal women whose disease has progressed 
following treatment with a prior endocrine therapy. In markets where 
250mg is approved, plans are in place to replace the dose with 
500mg and, in markets where Faslodex is not approved, plans are 
to seek approval for the 500mg dose as the first registration. 
Casodex and Zoladex are both leading endocrine therapies for the 
treatment of prostate cancer. Casodex is used as a 50mg tablet for 
the treatment of advanced prostate cancer and as a 150mg tablet  
for the treatment of locally advanced prostate cancer.
Zoladex, a luteinising hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) agonist, 
is approved in 120 countries for the treatment of prostate cancer, 
breast cancer and certain benign gynaecological disorders. In 
non-metastatic prostate cancer, Zoladex has been shown to improve 
overall survival, both when used in addition to radical prostatectomy 
and when used in addition to radiotherapy. In breast cancer, Zoladex 
is widely approved for use in advanced breast cancer in pre-
menopausal women. In a number of countries, Zoladex is also 
approved for the adjuvant treatment of early stage pre-menopausal 
breast cancer as an alternative to and/or in addition to chemotherapy. 
Zoladex offers proven survival benefits for breast cancer patients with 
a favourable tolerability profile. Launches of generic goserelin (the 
active ingredient in Zoladex) are expected in Europe during 2012.
Iressa is approved in 81 countries and is one of the leading epidermal 
growth factor receptor-tyrosine kinase (EGFR-TK) inhibitors in Japan 
and the Asia Pacific region where it is marketed for pre-treated 
advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Outside the EU, 
indications are being sought or expanded from the pre-treated setting 
to include 1st line patients whose tumours harbour activating 
mutations of the EGFR–TK inhibitor.
In the EU, Iressa has been launched as the first personalised medicine 
for the treatment of adults with locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC 
with activating mutations.
Caprelsa (vandetanib) fights cancer through two proven mechanisms: 
blocking the development of tumour blood supply by inhibition of the 
vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) pathway and by inhibiting 
the growth and survival of the tumour through epidermal growth factor 
receptor (EGFR) and rearranged during transfection (RET) pathways. 
Vandetanib was approved by the FDA in April 2011 for the treatment  
of symptomatic or progressive medullary thyroid cancer (MTC) in 
patients with unresectable locally advanced or metastatic disease with 
approval for the trade name Caprelsa subsequently granted by the 
FDA in August. A Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) is 
required for Caprelsa by the FDA due to the risks of QT prolongation, 
Torsades de pointes and sudden death. In November, the MAA for 
Caprelsa received a positive opinion from the CHMP for the treatment 
of aggressive and symptomatic MTC in patients with unresectable 
locally advanced or metastatic disease. Caprelsa remains under 
review by other regulatory agencies. There are approximately 30 
early-stage studies ongoing that look at cancers in which vandetanib 
might be effective. These cancers include pancreatic, glioblastoma 
(brain), biliary tract (liver duct), and thyroid (papillary and follicular).
In the pipeline 
Cediranib is an anti-angiogenic compound that has been evaluated 
across a range of tumour types. Study BR 29, a National Cancer 
Institute of Canada sponsored Phase II/III study, exploring cediranib  
in combination with carboplatin/paclitaxel in patients with NSCLC  
was stopped because it did not meet pre-specified efficacy criteria to 
progress to Phase III. Several ongoing Phase II studies with cediranib 
will continue to completion, however no further development is planned.
Zibotentan (ZD4054) is a specific endothelin A-receptor antagonist. 
AstraZeneca has ended the investigation of zibotentan as a potential 
treatment for cancer following the results of clinical trials in patients 
with advanced prostate cancer. In February 2011, the Phase III 
ENTHUSE study 15, which studied zibotentan monotherapy in 
patients with non-metastatic castrate resistant prostate cancer 
(CRPC), was stopped following the results of an early efficacy review 
by the Independent Data Monitoring Committee. This review indicated 
that zibotentan monotherapy was unlikely to meet its primary efficacy

endpoints of progression free survival and overall survival and was 
therefore unlikely to benefit patients with non-metastatic CRPC. In 
July, the results from the Phase III ENTHUSE study 33, showed that 
the addition of zibotentan to docetaxel did not improve the overall 
survival for metastatic CRPC patients. The full data from both of these 
studies, in addition to the data from the Phase III ENTHUSE study 14 
announced in 2010 will be published in due course. 
In December, AstraZeneca announced its decision to discontinue the 
development of olaparib (AZD2281) for the maintenance treatment of 
serous ovarian cancer. This followed a review of an interim analysis of  
a Phase II study (study 19) which indicated that the previously reported 
progression free survival benefit was unlikely to translate into an overall 
survival benefit, the definitive measure of patient benefit in ovarian cancer. 
Our early oncology pipeline includes a range of novel compounds that 
target signalling pathways believed to be pivotal in cancer cell growth 
and survival as well as DNA repair mechanisms. AZD8931, a pan-erb 
kinase inhibitor, continues in Phase II trials in different segments of 
metastatic breast cancer.
Selumetinib (AZD6244/ARRY-142886) is a potent MEK (mitogen-
activated protein kinase 1) inhibitor, licensed from Array BioPharma, 
Inc. In October, data from a Phase II placebo-controlled study of 
selumetinib in combination with docetaxel in the 2nd line treatment of 
lung cancer patients was reported. The study’s primary endpoint of 
overall survival demonstrated a numerically greater increase in survival 
in favour of selumetinib in combination with docetaxel versus docetaxel 
alone, but did not reach statistical significance. The secondary 
endpoints were all demonstrated with statistical significance.
AZD4547 is in Phase II testing for solid tumours. AZD1480, AZD2014, 
AZD3514 and AZD5363 are all completing Phase I studies while 
AZD1208 entered Phase I clinical trials in 2011. AZD7762 and 
AZD2461 were terminated in 2011 while AZD8055, a selective TOR 
kinase inhibitor, was discontinued and effort focused on a second 
compound, AZD2014.
We are also developing potential new cancer drugs using a variety  
of biologics approaches. Our investigational biologics are directed 
towards molecular targets with a strong role in cancer progression 
and incorporate innovative technologies, providing the potential to 
eliminate cancer cells in more effective ways. Within biologics, we 
continue to progress a discovery and clinical pipeline that is balanced 
across different anti-tumour approaches, including impacting cancer 
cells directly (growth factor and survival signalling), modulating the 
blood supply that tumours need to grow (vascular modulation) and 
activating a patient’s own immune system to eliminate cancer cells 
(immune-mediated killing).
Tremelimumab is a CTLA-4 MAb and uses certain parts of the 
immune system to fight diseases, including cancer. Tumours have 
mechanisms to evade the immune system, and blockade of CTLA-4 
with tremelimumab can reactivate the immune system to help fight  
the cancer. AstraZeneca entered into an in-licensing agreement with 
Pfizer for tremelimumab in October. Under the terms of this 
agreement, AstraZeneca will assume global development rights to 
tremelimumab and Pfizer will retain the rights to use tremelimumab 
with specified types of combination therapies. We plan to explore 
tremelimumab in a number of potential cancer indications.
Our biologics pipeline also includes investigational treatments for 
cancers of the blood as well as for a variety of solid tumours. We 
currently have two investigational drugs in Phase II trials and five 
investigational drugs in Phase I clinical trials. Additional drug 
candidates are expected to progress into Phase I and Phase II  
trials in 2012.

Therapy Area Review Respiratory & Inflammation 73 Our strategic objectives
We aim to build on our strong position in the respiratory and 
inflammation field through the growth of key products, with new 
indications and market launches, including chronic obstructive 
pulmonary disease (COPD), as well as through developing a strong 
pipeline of novel small molecule and biologics approaches to COPD 
and asthma. We aspire to enter the rheumatology market through  
our biologics pipeline and targeted small molecule approaches such 
as fostamatinib.
COPD and asthma 
According to WHO, COPD, a serious lung disease that includes 
chronic bronchitis and/or emphysema, is currently the fourth leading 
cause of death worldwide, with future increases anticipated. Current 
treatment has recently demonstrated some survival benefit but the 
impact of medication on the course of the disease is small and the 
prognosis of the COPD patient remains poor. In asthma, morbidity 
and mortality remain important issues and disease normalisation is 
not achieved by any treatment.
The typical treatment for both moderate COPD and asthma is a fixed 
dose combination of an inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) with a long-acting 
beta-agonist (LABA) (for example Symbicort) or for COPD specifically, 
an inhaled long-acting muscarinic antagonist (LAMA). Other major 
asthma treatments include monotherapy ICSs, oral leukotriene 
receptor antagonists and/or oral steroids for severe disease and (in 
combination with antibiotics) for exacerbations. Over recent years, 
studies employing patient-centric tools, such as the asthma control 
questionnaire, have revealed surprisingly low asthma control at all 
severities, highlighting an underestimated medical need.
Our focus
Our key marketed products 
Symbicort improves symptoms and provides a clinically important 
improvement in the health of many patients with either asthma or 
COPD by providing effective and rapid control of the symptoms.
Symbicort pMDI (pressurised metered-dose inhaler) is indicated, in the 
US, for the treatment of asthma in patients 12 years of age and older. 
The COPD indication was approved and launched in the US in early 
2009. In June 2010, the US Prescribing Information was updated to 
include the FDA’s new recommendations for appropriate use of asthma 
medications containing LABAs. The class label changes for all 
LABA-containing products are specific to the treatment of asthma  
and do not apply to the treatment of COPD.
Symbicort Turbuhaler was launched in Japan for the treatment of adult 
asthma in January 2010 and is co-promoted in Japan with Astellas. 
Symbicort SMART provides increased asthma control and simplifies 
asthma management through the use of only one inhaler for both 
maintenance and relief of asthma symptoms. As well as being a cost 
effective treatment for many healthcare payers, the Symbicort SMART 
approach can also result in lower ICS and oral steroid use compared 
to other treatment options.
Pulmicort is one of the world’s leading inhaled corticosteroids for the 
treatment of asthma and is available in several forms. Teva has had an 
exclusive licence to sell a generic version of Pulmicort Respules in the 
US since 2009. 
In March 2011, the production of Pulmicort (budesonide) 100 and 
200 µg/dose HFA pMDI (pressurised metered-dose inhaler) was 
discontinued due to complex manufacturing issues related to 
technical aspects of the device, which prevented the ongoing 
manufacture of the product. This issue was not related to the active 
ingredient, budesonide. The impact of this withdrawal has been 
minimal, representing less than 3% of total Pulmicort sales for 2010. 
Our other respiratory products, including Pulmicort Turbuhaler and 
Pulmicort Respules were not affected as they use different devices 
or device compounds. Our other pMDI products such as Symbicort 
were also not affected. 
Clinical studies of our key marketed products 
In 2010, the FDA requested all manufacturers of LABA-containing 
products to conduct a post-marketing safety study to evaluate  
serious asthma outcomes with marketed pharmaceuticals when 
added to corticosteroids compared to corticosteroids alone to treat 
asthma. In December, recruitment began for a randomised, double-
blind, 26-week, active-controlled clinical trial comparing Symbicort 
pMDI with budesonide HFA pMDI to evaluate the risk of serious 
asthma outcomes (hospitalisations, intubation and death) in 11,700 
adult and adolescent patients 12 years of age and older with 
persistent asthma.
In the pipeline 
Building on our capabilities in combinations and device development 
demonstrated through our experience with Symbicort, we are aiming 
to further improve the mainstay of treatment for COPD patients by 
combining bronchodilators such as the LAMA (AZD8683, being 
developed in collaboration with Pulmagen Therapeutics (Synergy) 
Limited), with inhaled anti-inflammatory compounds such as inhaled 
selective glucocorticoid receptor agonists (AZD5423, being developed 
in collaboration with Bayer Schering Pharma AG), which recently 
commenced Phase II studies. Additionally, we are targeting

AstraZeneca Annual Report and Form 20-F Information 2011 74 Therapy Area Review Respiratory & Inflammation inflammation in COPD using oral routes of administration and  
have commenced a Phase II study of AZD5069, a CXCR2 antagonist 
that targets neutrophils. A biological approach, MEDI-8968, a  
MAb targeting the IL -1 receptor, has also commenced a Phase II  
trial in COPD. 
We are targeting uncontrolled asthma/asthma exacerbations through 
small molecule approaches such as a CRTh2 receptor antagonist  
and toll-like receptor 7 agonists (being developed in collaboration  
with Dainippon Sumitomo) as well as biological approaches such  
as benralizumab (MEDI-563), a MAb that binds to the interleukin-5 
receptor which results in depletion of eosinophils and basophils,  
and tralokinumab (CAT-354), a MAb that targets interleukin-13.
Rheumatology 
Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is currently treated with generic disease-
modifying anti-rheumatic agents and, where the relevant criteria are 
met, biologic disease-modifiers. There remains a need for novel 
effective treatments since only about a third of patients treated with 
biologics achieve their treatment goals. We anticipate that the RA 
market will experience modest annual growth over the next decade on 
top of the current revenues of approximately $10 billion to $12 billion
1
. 
Sales of the biologic tumour necrosis factor (TNF) alpha blockers 
accounted for 75% of major-market RA sales in 2011. Use of other 
biologic approaches, currently reserved for TNF blocker failures,  
is expected to increase due to new entrants, new subcutaneous 
formulations and use earlier in the treatment pathway. Novel oral drugs 
targeting intra-cellular signalling pathways that provide anti-TNF-like 
levels of efficacy and potentially more convenient dosing will likely be 
used both after and ahead of the TNF blockers, especially in patients 
who currently choose not to take, are anxious about taking or are 
ineligible to take, injectable biologic agents.
Current treatment of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) focuses  
on controlling disease flares, preventing renal failure and suppressing 
symptoms to an acceptable level while minimising toxicity. Although  
a disease-modifying agent has been launched for SLE, most 
emerging biologic agents will likely be used initially in combination with 
corticosteroids or immunosuppressants to provide incremental benefit 
and/or allow reduced doses or numbers of these agents.
In the pipeline 
Fostamatinib (previously known as R788) was in-licensed from Rigel  
in 2010. Fostamatinib is at the most advanced stage of development 
of the oral spleen tyrosine kinase (SYK) inhibitors being evaluated for 
an RA indication. It is thought to block reversible signalling in multiple 
cell types involved in inflammation and tissue degradation in RA.  
The ongoing Phase III programme, called OSKIRA, commenced in 
September 2010. A further Phase IIb monotherapy study (OSKIRA 4) 
was initiated in January 2011. This study will provide important 
information on the profile of fostamatinib, unconfounded by 
background disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs, such as 
methotrexate. The first anticipated regulatory filings based on the 
OSKIRA programme are currently anticipated for 2013. 
In 2011, we continued to invest in several novel multi-functional MAbs 
in inflammatory and autoimmune conditions. Sifalimumab (MEDI-545), 
which targets interferon-alpha, commenced a Phase IIb study in 
patients with SLE. MEDI-546, which targets the Type I IFN receptor,  
is initiating a Phase IIb study in patients with SLE. Mavrilimumab 
(CAM-3001, licensed from CSL Limited) which targets the alpha 
sub-unit of the granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor 
receptor, successfully completed a Phase II study evaluating the 
efficacy and safety in subjects with RA and is being prepared for a 
Phase IIb study in RA patients.

Reducing the number  
of heart-related deaths
Germany is proud of its healthcare system yet still has high mortality rates for coronary 
heart disease. ‘Herzbewusst’ (heart conscious) is a programme designed to help 
people help themselves in preventing acute coronary syndromes and, for the first time 
in Germany, has included a variety of stakeholders from the outset.
In 2004, 150 out of every 100,000 German male 
coronary patients died, whereas in the Netherlands, it 
was less than 100. One in eight of those who survive a 
heart attack in Germany dies within a year. Combating 
this requires better education, encouraging people to 
make healthier lifestyle choices such as improving diet, 
taking more exercise and quitting smoking – this can 
help not only prevent the first heart attack but also 
safeguard patients’ lives after the event. 
We developed the Herzbewusst programme in 
conjunction with the German Federation of 
Cardiologists in Private Practice and in cooperation 
with public and private health insurance funds. In 
addition to physicians and healthcare practitioners, the 
campaign, launched in October 2010, is aimed at the 
public. A series of high-profile events and advertising 
has included installations at a Berlin train station and 
‘Regional Heartdays’ offering free consultations from 
cardiologists and nutritional guidance.

US
AstraZeneca is the fourth largest pharmaceutical company in the  
US, with a 6% market share of US prescription pharmaceuticals  
by sales value.
Sales in the US decreased by 2% to $13,426 million (2010: $13,727 million), 
as strong performance from our key growth brands was offset by the 
impact of increased generic competition experienced by our mature 
brands. Combined sales of our key growth brands, namely, Brilinta, 
Crestor, Onglyza™, Seroquel, Symbicort and Faslodex, were up by 
16% to $8,474 million (2010: $7,316 million). Increased generic 
competition for Arimidex, and Toprol-XL and its authorised generic, 
resulted in a sales decline in these brands of 62% to $446 million 
(2010: $1,183 million). 
Brilinta was approved by the FDA in July to reduce the risk of 
cardiovascular death and heart attacks in patients with acute coronary 
syndromes (ACS). Unrestricted managed markets access was 59%, 
and trial among target interventional cardiologist initiators was 6% at 
the end of 2011. Crestor achieved sales of $3,074 million (2010: $2,640 
million) and a total prescription growth of 4.4% within the statin market. 
This growth outpaced the market almost four-fold. A competitor to 
Crestor, atorvastatin, was available in generic form in the US beginning 
in late 2011.
Seroquel continued to be the most prescribed atypical anti-psychotic, 
with sales up 10% to $4,123 million (2010: $3,747 million). Total 
Seroquel prescriptions declined by 1%, driven by Seroquel IR erosion 
of 4% due to increased generic and branded competition. Strong 
Seroquel XR prescription volume growth of 17% partially offset the 
total Seroquel IR prescription volume decline. Seroquel XR accounts 
for 18% of total Seroquel prescription volume in the US, up from 16% 
at the end of 2010. 
Symbicort pMDI continued to deliver steady growth in the US, with 
sales up 17% to $846 million (2010: $721 million) and prescription 
growth of 10%, leading the fixed combination class in total prescription 
growth. It achieved a 20.3% total prescription share and a 21.5% new 
prescription share of the inhaled corticosteroid/long-acting beta-
agonist market.
Onglyza™/Kombiglyze XR™ captured one in four new dipeptidyl 
peptidase IV (DPP-IV) patient treatment decisions and achieved a 
6.5% total prescription market share gain in 2011, ending the year  
with a total prescription market share of 16.5% of the DPP-IV inhibitor 
market. Kombiglyze XR™ was launched in January 2011 and doctors 
are now prescribing it to one in 10 new patients. Onglyza™ revenues 
in the US were $156 million (2010: $54 million).
Nexium was the fifth most prescribed branded pharmaceutical in 
the US. In the face of continuing generic, OTC and pricing pressures, 
Nexium sales declined 11% to $2,397 million (2010: $2,695 million). 
Nexium remains the branded market leader retaining significant 
market share and volume within the proton pump inhibitor class. 
Sales of Toprol-XL and its authorised generic (metoprolol succinate 
extended-release tablets), which is marketed and distributed by Par 
Pharmaceutical Companies, Inc. (Par) decreased 41% to $404 million 
(2010: $689 million), due to the impact of generic competition from 
Watson Pharmaceuticals Inc. and Wockhardt Limited, which entered 
the market in 2010. In December, Mylan Inc. announced that its 
subsidiary Mylan Pharmaceuticals Inc. (Mylan) received final approval 
from the FDA for its ANDA for metoprolol succinate extended-release 
tablets in 25mg, 50mg, 100mg and 200mg doses.
Following multiple generic anastrozole products entering the US 
market in June 2010, sales of Arimidex declined by 91% to $42 million 
(2010: $494 million). 
In June, the US District Court ruled that Mylan did not infringe  
the Entocort formulation patent (EC patent no. 5,643,602). Following 
Mylan’s entry of its generic, AstraZeneca launched an authorised 
generic with marketing and distribution by Par Pharmaceutical, Inc.
In 2011, sales of Synagis were down 12% to $570 million 
(2010: $646 million). Sales in the 2010/2011 RSV season started 
slower than anticipated due to later than forecast seasonal onset, 
coupled with payer pressure resulting from wider adoption of more 
restrictive guidelines regarding the use and dosing of Synagis by 
the American Academy of Pediatrics.
Sales for Aptium Oncology increased by 2% to $224 million (2010: 
$219 million) and sales for Astra Tech were down 24% to $77 million 
(2010: $101 million), all recorded in the period prior to its disposal to 
DENTSPLY International Inc., which completed in August.
In March 2010, the Affordable Care Act came into force. It has had, 
and is expected to continue to have, a significant impact on our US 
sales and the US healthcare industry as a whole. For 2010, the impact 
of higher minimum Medicaid rebates on prescription drugs was a 
reduction in our pre-tax profit for the period of nearly $230 million.  
In 2011, the overall reduction in our profit before tax for the year due to 
higher minimum Medicaid rebates on prescription drugs, discounts on 
branded pharmaceutical sales to Medicare Part D beneficiaries and 
an industry-wide excise fee was $750 million. These amounts reflect 
only those effects of the Affordable Care Act that we know have had 
or will have a direct impact on our financial condition or results of 
operations and which we are therefore able to quantify based on 
known and isolatable resulting changes in individual financial items 
within our financial statements. There are other potential indirect or 
associated consequences of these legislative developments, which 
continue to evolve and which cannot be estimated but could have 
similar impacts. These include broader changes in access to or 
eligibility for coverage under Medicare, Medicaid or similar 
governmental programmes, such as the recent proposals to limit 
Medicare benefits. These could indirectly impact our pricing or sales 
of prescription products within the private sector. By their nature and 
the fact that these potentially numerous consequences are not directly 
linked to a corresponding and quantifiable impact on our financial 
statements, it is not possible to accurately estimate the financial 
impact of these potential consequences of the Affordable Care Act or 
related legislative changes when taken together with the number of 
other market and industry related factors that can also result in similar 
impacts. Further details of the potential impact of the Affordable Care 
Act are contained in the Pricing pressure section from page 18 and 
the Principal risks and uncertainties section from page 130.
Currently, there is no direct government control of prices for 
commercial prescription drug sales in the US. However, some publicly 
funded programmes, such as Medicaid and TRICARE (Department of 
Veterans Affairs), have statutorily mandated rebates and discounts that 
have the effect of price controls for these programmes. Additionally, 
pressure on pricing, availability and utilisation of prescription drugs  
for both commercial and public payers continues to increase. This  
is driven by, among other things, an increased focus on generic 
alternatives. Primary drivers of increased generic use are budgetary 
policies within healthcare systems and providers, including the use of 
‘generics only’ formularies, and increases in patient co-insurance or 
co-payments. In 2011, 80% of the prescriptions dispensed in the US 
were generic. While it is unlikely that there will be widespread adoption 
of a broad national price-control scheme in the near future, there will 
continue to be increased attention to pharmaceutical prices and their 
impact on healthcare costs for the foreseeable future.
AstraZeneca Annual Report and Form 20-F Information 2011 78 Geographical Review Rest of World
Sales performance outside the US in 2011 was down by only 2%  
to $20,165 million (2010: $19,542 million), despite the continuing 
challenging economic environment. Combined sales of key products 
(Arimidex, Crestor, Nexium, Seroquel and Symbicort) were down 
1% with sales of $10,301 million (2010: $9,923 million). Emerging 
Markets delivered particularly strong sales, up 10% with sales of 
$5,763 million (2010: $5,198 million). 
Western Europe
AstraZeneca is the sixth largest prescription-based pharmaceutical 
company in Western Europe, with a 4.4% market share of prescription 
sales by value.
Total sales in Western Europe were down 11% to $8,501 million  
(2010: $9,168 million) due largely to volume erosion on Nexium, 
Arimidex and Merrem following generic entrants and the negative 
price impact from price reductions primarily related to government 
interventions. This development was partially offset by volume growth 
attributable to Crestor, Seroquel XR, Symbicort, Iressa and Faslodex. 
Crestor outperformed the statin class with strong 13% sales 
growth by volume. Likewise, Seroquel outperformed the atypical 
anti-psychotics market segment more than twice in value, with  
strong growth of Seroquel XR, up by 31%, primarily driven by the 
bipolar indication. Generic versions of Nexium are now available 
in most markets with overall sales down 39% to $762 million  
(2010: $1,202 million). 
Brilique was launched in Germany, the UK, Italy, Spain, Norway, 
Sweden, Denmark, Finland, Austria, Greece and Switzerland, and 
sales exceeded $9 million.
The macro-economic situation has deteriorated, leading to increased 
pressure on healthcare budgets with some European markets 
beginning to emerge from the crisis and others still facing major  
issues with the implementation of new austerity measures. Most 
governments in Europe intervene directly to control the price, volume 
and reimbursement of medicines. Several governments have imposed 
price reductions and increased the use of generic medicines as part 
of healthcare expenditure control. Several countries are applying strict 
criteria for cost effectiveness evaluations of medicines which has 
delayed and reduced access to medicines for patients in areas of 
important unmet medical need. These and other measures all 
contribute to an increasingly difficult environment for branded 
pharmaceuticals in Europe. 
In Germany, sales growth fell by 8% to $1, 189 million (2010: $1,235 million), 
as the increased compulsory rebates for Symbicort and Seroquel 
were carried over from mid-2010 and reference pricing for Symbicort 
and Atacand commenced. However, Seroquel, Faslodex and Iressa all 
showed a strong performance on an underlying volume basis. As a 
result of the debt crisis in Greece, the Greek government implemented 
significant price cuts in 2010 and 2011 which resulted in an overall 
sales decline of 9% to $305 million (2010: $322 million). In the UK, an 
18% decrease in sales to $866 million (2010: $1,022 million) reflected 
strong volume erosion on Nexium by 56%, Merrem by 86% and 
Arimidex by 76% respectively following generic entry which was not 
offset by the solid performance from Symbicort and Seroquel XR. 
Overall sales in France decreased by 12% to $1,740 million  
(2010: $1,889 million), driven by Nexium erosion, down to $266 million 
(2010: $448 million), a 42% fall following generic entry at the end of 
April 2011, which was not entirely offset by double digit growth of 
Crestor and continued strong growth of Symbicort, Faslodex and 
Iressa despite significant competition. Sales in Italy were down by 11% 
to $1,113 million (2010: $1,198 million). Our main sales were hit by price 
cuts on off patent products to align their prices with the EU average 
price, and by price cuts and prescription controls on Crestor. Despite 
this, we achieved double digit volume growth for Crestor, Seroquel 
and Symbicort.
Established ROW
Sales in Established ROW increased by 4%. The key products driving 
sales growth in 2011 were Crestor, Symbicort, Nexium and Seroquel.
Canada
In 2011, AstraZeneca became the largest research-based 
pharmaceutical company in Canada by sales value. Despite loss  
of exclusivity for Atacand after expiry of the compound patent 
(Canadian patent no. 2,040,955) and the ‘at-risk’ launch of a generic 
version of Nexium by a competitor, total Canadian sales increased 
by 1% to $1,604 million (2010: $1,510 million). Combined sales  
of Crestor, Nexium, Symbicort and Seroquel were $1,171 million 
(2010: $1,055 million). Crestor became the largest prescription product 
in Canada by sales value, with year-on-year sales growth of 14% to 
$716 million (2010: $600 million). 
The Canadian provinces continue to adopt provincial and regional 
approaches to pharmaceutical funding, from one end of the 
continuum in Quebec, with more open access, to more restricted 
access in British Columbia. Overall, the trend in Canada indicates  
that provinces will continue to introduce policy changes that drive  
cost savings and exert pricing pressure on new and existing 
medicines (for example, conditional listings, product listing agreements 
and bulk purchasing), while providing reasonable patient access to 
innovative medicines.
Japan
Sales in Japan increased by 6% to $3,064 million (2010: $2,617 million). 
The Tohoku earthquake and tsunami did not significantly disrupt 
supply of AstraZeneca medicines and did not have a material impact 
on financial performance. 
Strong volume gains of 7% were driven mainly by the continued 
growth of primary care brands. Sales of Crestor, which is co-promoted 
with Shionogi & Co. Limited, grew by 16% while sales of Symbicort 
Turbuhaler grew by 88% in its second year in the market. Sales growth 
of Losec slowed by 5%, following the September launch of Nexium 
(co-promoted with Daiichi Sankyo).
Our oncology business remains one of the leaders in Japan based  
on the performance of established brands including Iressa, Arimidex, 
Zoladex and Casodex. In November, we also completed the launch 
of Faslodex, the approval and launch of an additional indication for 
Iressa, and the signing of an agreement with Daiichi Sankyo to 
co-promote Ranmark
TM
 (denosumab) for the treatment of bone 
disorders stemming from bone metastasis. Daiichi Sankyo acquired 
the denosumab rights in 2007 from Amgen Inc. and received approval  
in January 2012.
Other Established ROW
Sales in Other Established ROW showed robust growth of 4% to 
$1,233 million (2010: $1,049 million). Strong volume growth in Australia 
for our key products was partially offset by the full year impact of price 
cuts imposed in April 2010 on Crestor and Nexium and continued 
price adjustments imposed by the Australian authorities in 2011. 
Crestor, Nexium and Symbicort all gained market share in the year, 
with Crestor achieving a 28% volume share in the statin class. Brilique 
has achieved registration in 2011 in both Australia and New Zealand, 
with Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme reimbursement in Australia 
expected in 2012.

Business Review
Geographical Review 79 Geographical Review
Emerging Markets
In the Emerging Markets, sales increased by 10% to $5,763 million 
(2010: $5,198 million), which was principally driven by growth in China 
and Latin America. 
In many of the larger markets, such as Brazil and Mexico, patients 
tend to pay directly for prescription medicines and consequently these 
markets are at less risk of direct government interventions on pricing 
and reimbursement. In other markets such as South Korea, Taiwan 
and Turkey, where governments do pay for medicines, we are seeing 
continued efforts to reduce the cost of prescriptions in line with the 
systems in Western Europe, Canada and Australia. 
Emerging Europe
Sales in Emerging Europe grew by 7% to $1,244 million  
(2010: $1,165 million) driven by increased sales in Russia and 
Romania, which more than offset reduced sales in Turkey.
We have continued to build our presence in Russia, where sales 
increased by 19% to $284 million (2010: $232 million) mainly due  
to increased sales of Symbicort by 41%, Nexium by 33% and Crestor 
by 25% driven by growth in the retail segment. We have also 
consolidated our position among the leaders in the hospital and 
regional reimbursement segments.
In Romania, we delivered a strong performance with sales up 24%  
to $154 million (2010: $119 million), largely as a result of sales of 
Atacand increasing by 63%, Seroquel increasing by 43% and 
Symbicort increasing by 86%. In late 2009, the Turkish government 
imposed unprecedented levels of price reductions on the 
pharmaceutical industry. As a result, our sales were down in  
Turkey in 2010, but recovered in 2011, up 7% to $297 million  
(2010: $304 million).
China
Our sales in China (excluding Hong Kong) increased by 15% to  
$1,261 million (2010: $1,047 million). The slow down in growth rate 
versus 2010 was primarily driven by a reduction in overall Chinese 
market growth which was particularly evident in major cities as  
well as weaker performance in our gastrointestinal and anaesthesia 
businesses. Our cardiovascular (CV) and oncology businesses 
continued to grow ahead of the market due to strong performances 
by Crestor and Betaloc Zok (Seloken/Toprol-XL), despite delays in 
activation of reimbursement in Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou.  
We continue to be one of the leading multinational pharmaceutical 
companies in China and the second largest in the prescription market 
by sales value. In November, we announced our decision to invest 
$200 million in a new manufacturing facility to further strengthen our 
position in China. In December, we announced we had entered into an 
agreement to acquire Guangdong BeiKang Pharmaceutical Company 
Limited, a generics company based in Conghua City, Guangdong 
province. This agreement, which remains subject to regulatory 
approval in China, will provide us with access to a portfolio of 
injectable medicines used to treat infections.
Emerging Asia Pacific
Sales in Emerging Asia Pacific grew 5% to $968 million  
(2010: $890 million). This was driven by strong sales growth in  
India, up 21%, Vietnam, up 29%, and Indonesia, up 11%. Growth  
was more subdued in markets which were more significantly  
impacted by government interventions on pricing or by measures 
which promoted local generic penetration, primarily in Taiwan, 
Thailand and the Philippines.
Other Emerging ROW
Our sales grew by 12% to $2,290 million (2010: $2,096 million)  
largely due to strong sales growth in Venezuela and Argentina.  
We achieved double digit year-on-year sales growth for most of our 
key products, Nexium, Seroquel XR, Symbicort, Zoladex, Atacand 
and Seloken. Excluding Brazil, where generic competitors entered the 
market for the first time in 2011, Crestor sales grew by around 12% 
across the region. 
In Latin America the pharmaceutical market continues to grow 
strongly, underpinned by a relatively stable political and economic 
climate. Strong competition from local, non-multinational, companies 
with branded generic products is increasingly becoming a feature of 
the region. 
Brazilian sales for the year were impacted by loss of exclusivity not 
only on Crestor but also Atacand monotherapy and Seroquel IR. The 
Brazilian pharmaceutical market continues to experience double digit 
growth. Mexican year-on-year sales were flat, mirroring a market that  
is currently showing low single digit growth. 
2011 saw successful launches of Brilinta in Brazil, Vimovo in a number 
of countries in Central America and the Caribbean, and Onglyza™  
in Colombia. 
In the Middle East and Africa, despite political challenges arising from 
the ‘Arab Spring’ revolutions, we further accelerated our growth with 
sales up 12%. Our largest markets were South Africa, Saudi Arabia, 
the UAE and Algeria where we achieved steady growth. South African 
growth was mainly driven by Symbicort up 12%, Seroquel up 14% 
and Crestor up 10%.

Expanding access and  
affordability for our medicines
In Brazil, our ‘Faz Bem’ (Wellbeing) programme provides discounts to the  
cost of our medicines. It also provides additional incentives for those who  
adhere to treatment regimes and so helps improve health outcomes.
Our Faz Bem programme of wellbeing in Brazil has the 
goal of increasing patient access to our medicines and 
improving treatment adherence rates. Patients are 
provided with information about the programme from 
their doctor and, once enrolled in the scheme, they 
receive a discount on a range of our products. The Faz 
Bem website supports patients with information about 
a range of diseases, their treatment and the benefits of 
a healthy lifestyle.
Faz Bem reflects our commitment to making the most 
meaningful difference to patient health by providing 
access to the growing middle class in Brazil. As well as 
providing patients with access to medicines for the first 
time, the programme improves patient health awareness. 
In doing so, Faz Bem both benefits our business and 
supports the efforts of the government to improve 
healthcare in Brazil.

AstraZeneca Annual Report and Form 20-F Information 2011 82 Financial Review Financial Review
Core operating profit was down 4%. Core R&D expense included a 
significant increase in intangible impairments compared with last year; 
without these, Core operating profit would have declined broadly in 
line with the revenue. Core earnings per share increased by 7%, 
benefiting from a lower tax rate and fewer shares outstanding as  
a result of share repurchases.
The actions related to the first two phases of our restructuring 
programmes are now completed, and are on track to deliver  
$4.3 billion in annual benefits by the end of 2014. These programmes 
have played an integral part in the significant improvement in our  
Core operating margin since they were launched in early 2007.
A new phase was announced in February 2012, and this programme 
is expected to deliver a further $1.6 billion in annual benefits by the 
end of 2014, at a planned cost of $2.1 billion.
Our cash generation remains strong, enabling us to invest for  
future growth and value by funding organic investment in R&D, 
externalisation and capital expenditures while also providing  
$9.4 billion in net cash distributions to shareholders by way of 
dividends and net share repurchases. 
Simon Lowth 
Chief Financial Officer
The purpose of this Financial Review is to provide 
a balanced and comprehensive analysis of the 
financial performance of the business during 
2011, the financial position as at the end of the 
year and the main business factors and trends 
which could affect the future financial 
performance of the business.
All growth rates in this Financial Review are expressed at CER unless 
noted otherwise.
2011 Business background and results overview
The business background is covered in The pharmaceutical industry 
section from page 15, the Therapy Area Review from page 56, and  
the Geographical Review from page 77 and describes in detail the 
developments in both our products and geographical regions. 
As described earlier in our Annual Report, sales of our products are 
directly influenced by medical need and are generally paid for by 
health insurance schemes or national healthcare budgets. Our 
operating results can be affected by a number of factors other than 
the delivery of operating plans and normal competition, such as:
>   The adverse impact on pharmaceutical prices as a result of the 
macroeconomic and regulatory environment. For instance, although 
there is no direct governmental control on prices in the US, action 
from federal and individual state programmes and health insurance 
bodies is leading to downward pressures on realised prices. In other 
parts of the world, there is a variety of price and volume control 
mechanisms and retrospective rebates based on sales levels that 
are imposed by governments. 
>   The risk of generic competition following loss of patent protection or 
patent expiry or an ‘at risk’ launch by a competitor, with the potential 
adverse effects on sales volumes and prices. For example in 2011, 
our performance was affected by generic competition in the US for 
Arimidex and Toprol-XL. Further details of patent expiries for our key 
marketed products are included in the Patent expiries section on 
page 35.
>   The timings of new product launches, which can be influenced  
by national regulators, and the risk that such new products do not 
succeed as anticipated, together with the rate of sales growth  
and costs following new product launches. 
>   Currency fluctuations. Our functional and reporting currency is  
the US dollar, but we have substantial exposures to other 
currencies, in particular the euro, Japanese yen, pound sterling  
and Swedish krona. 
>   Macro factors such as greater demand from an ageing population 
and increasing requirements of servicing Emerging Markets. 
Over the longer term, the success of our R&D is crucial and we devote 
substantial resources to this area. The benefits of this investment 
emerge over the long term and there is considerable inherent 
uncertainty as to whether and when it will generate future products.
The most significant features of our financial results in 2011 are:
>  Revenue was down 2% at $33,591 million (Reported: up 1%).
>   Strong double digit sales growth at CER for Crestor, Seroquel XR 
and Symbicort. 
>  Emerging Markets revenue increased by 10% (Reported: 11%). 
>   Revenue performance reflects the loss of nearly $2 billion of revenue 
from generic competition, as well as a further $1 billion lost to the 
impact of government price interventions. 
>  Core operating profit was down 4% (Reported: 3%) to $13,167 million.
> Operating profit up 10% (Reported: 11%) to $12,795 million.
>  The sale of Astra Tech, which resulted in a gain of $1,483 million  
and was excluded from Core operating profit. 
>  Core operating margin of 39.2% of revenue was down 1.2 
percentage points (Reported: 1.6 percentage points), as benefits 
arising from higher gross margin and lower SG&A spend at CER 
were more than offset by increased expenditures in R&D and lower 
Core other income. Reported operating margin was 38.1%.
>  Core EPS increased by 7% (Reported: 9%) to $7.28. Basic EPS  
was up 29% (Reported: 31%) to $7.33. Basic and Core EPS 
benefited from the lower number of shares outstanding resulting 
from net share repurchases and a lower effective tax rate compared 
with last year. 
>  Dividends paid increased to $3,764 million (2010: $3,361 million). 
Net share repurchases totalled $5,606 million.
>  Total restructuring costs associated with the global programme to 
reshape the cost base of the business were $1,161 million in 2011. 
This brings the total restructuring costs charged to 31 December 
2011 to $4,869 million.
AstraZeneca Annual Report and Form 20-F Information 2011
Business Review
Financial Review 83 Financial Review
Measuring performance 
The following measures are referred to when reporting on our 
performance both in absolute terms but more often in comparison 
to earlier years in this Financial Review:
>   Reported performance. Reported performance takes into 
account all the factors (including those which we cannot 
influence, principally currency exchange rates) that have affected 
the results of our business as reflected in our Group Financial 
Statements prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by 
the EU and as issued by the IASB. 
>   Core financial measures. These are non-GAAP measures 
because, unlike Reported performance, they cannot be derived 
directly from the information in the Group’s Financial Statements. 
These measures are adjusted to exclude certain significant  
items, such as charges and provisions related to our global 
restructuring programmes, amortisation and impairment of the 
significant intangibles relating to the acquisition of MedImmune  
in 2007, the amortisation and impairment of the significant 
intangibles relating to our current and future exit arrangements 
with Merck in the US and other specified items. See the 2011 
Reconciliation of Reported results to Core results table on page 
85 for a reconciliation of Reported to Core performance. 
>   Constant exchange rate (CER) growth rates. These are 
also non-GAAP measures. These measures remove the effects 
of currency movements (by retranslating the current year’s 
performance at previous year’s exchange rates and adjusting  
for other exchange effects, including hedging). A reconciliation  
of the Reported results adjusted for the impact of currency 
movements is provided in the 2011 Reported operating profit 
table on page 85. 
>   Gross and operating profit margin percentages, and 
Core pre-R&D operating margin. These measures set out 
the progression of key performance margins and illustrate the 
overall quality of the business. Core pre-R&D operating margin  
is a non-GAAP measure of our Core financial performance.  
A reconciliation of Core pre-R&D operating margin to our 
operating profit is provided on pages 85 and 91.
>  Prescription volumes and trends for key products. 
These measures can represent the real business growth and  
the progress of individual products better and more immediately 
than invoiced sales. 
>   Net funds/debt. This represents our cash and cash equivalents, 
current investments and derivative financial instruments less 
interest-bearing loans and borrowings. 
CER measures allow us to focus on the changes in sales and 
expenses driven by volume, prices and cost levels relative to the 
prior period. Sales and cost growth expressed in CER allows 
management to understand the true local movement in sales and 
costs, in order to compare recent trends and relative return on 
investment. CER growth rates can be used to analyse sales in a 
number of ways but, most often, we consider CER growth by 
products and groups of products, and by countries and regions. 
CER sales growth can be further analysed into the impact of sales 
volumes and selling price. Similarly, CER cost growth helps us to 
focus on the real local change in costs so that we can manage the 
cost base effectively.
We believe that disclosing Core financial and growth measures in 
addition to our Reported financial information enhances investors’ 
ability to evaluate and analyse the underlying financial performance 
of our ongoing business and the related key business drivers. The 
adjustments made to our Reported financial information in order to 
show Core financial measures illustrate clearly, and on a year-on-
year or period-by-period basis, the impact upon our performance 
caused by factors such as changes in sales and expenses driven by 
volume, prices and cost levels relative to such prior years or periods.
As shown in the 2011 Reconciliation of Reported results to Core 
results table on page 85, our reconciliation of Reported financial 
information to Core financial measures includes a breakdown of the 
items for which our Reported financial information is adjusted and a 
further breakdown of those items by specific line item as such items 
are reflected in our Reported income statement. This illustrates the 
significant items that are excluded from Core financial measures 
and their impact on our Reported financial information, both as a 
whole and in respect of specific line items.
Core pre-R&D operating margin is our Core operating margin 
before research and development costs recorded in the year.  
This measure reflects Core operating performance before 
reinvestment in internal research and development.
Management presents these results externally to meet investors’ 
requirements for transparency and clarity. Core financial measures 
are also used internally in the management of our business 
performance, in our budgeting process and when determining 
compensation.
Core financial measures are non-GAAP adjusted measures. All 
items for which Core financial measures are adjusted are included 
in our Reported financial information as they represent actual costs 
of our business in the periods presented. As a result, Core financial 
measures merely allow investors to differentiate between different 
kinds of costs and they should not be used in isolation. You should 
also refer to our Reported financial information in the 2011 Reported 
operating profit table on page 85, our reconciliation of Core financial 
measures to Reported financial information in the Reconciliation  
of Reported results to Core results table on page 85, and to the 
Results of operations – summary analysis of year to 31 December 
2010 section from page 91 for our discussion of comparative 
Reported growth measures that reflect all factors that affect our 
business. Our determination of non-GAAP measures, and our 
presentation of them within this financial information, may differ 
from similarly titled non-GAAP measures of other companies.
The SET retains strategic management of the costs excluded  
from Reported financial information in arriving at Core financial 
measures, tracking their impact on Reported operating profit and 
EPS, with operational management being delegated on a case-by-
case basis to ensure clear accountability and consistency for each 
cost category.

Financial Review 85 Financial Review
Results of operations – summary analysis of year  
to 31 December 2011 continued
Revenue increased by 1% on a Reported basis but decreased by 2% 
on a CER basis. As in 2010, revenue benefited from strong growth of 
Crestor, Symbicort and Seroquel but was offset by lower revenues for 
Nexium, Arimidex and Seloken/Toprol-XL. Emerging Markets sales 
growth of 10% (Reported: 11%) and Established ROW 4% (Reported: 
14%) was offset by a decline in US sales of 2% (Reported: 2%) and 
Western Europe of 11% (Reported: 7%). Further details of our sales 
performance are contained in the Performance 2011 sections of the 
Therapy Area Review from page 56 and the Geographical Review  
from page 77.
Core gross margin of 82.2% increased 1.3 percentage points (Reported: 
1.0 percentage points). The year-on-year improvement in the margin 
was largely due to the impact of the intangible impairment related to 
lesogaberan on 2010 gross margin and a $131 million benefit from  
the settlement of patent disputes with PDL Biopharma Inc. in 2011.
Core R&D expenditure was $5,033 million, 15% higher than last year 
(Reported: 19%), driven by higher intangible impairments charged  
to R&D expenditure in 2011, including $285 million for olaparib and 
$150 million for TC-5214, and late stage project spend. 
Core SG&A costs of $9,918 million were 2% lower than in 2010 
(Reported: 1% higher). Investment in Emerging Markets and recently 
launched brands, as well as the impact of the US healthcare reform 
excise tax were more than offset by operational efficiencies across 
Established Markets.
Core other income of $845 million was $65 million less than the previous 
year principally as a result of a higher level of disposal gains in 2010.
Core pre-R&D operating margin was 54.2%, up 1.0 percentage points 
(Reported: 0.7 percentage points), as the higher gross margin was 
only slightly offset by lower Core other income and higher SG&A costs 
as a percentage of revenue.
Core operating profit was $13,167 million, a decrease of 4% (Reported: 
3%). Core operating margin declined by 1.2 percentage points 
(Reported: 1.6 percentage points) to 39.2% as a result of the higher 
R&D spend and lower Core other operating income.
Core EPS were $7.28, up 7% (Reported: 9%), with the lower operating 
profit offset by a lower effective tax rate, lower net interest as well as 
the benefit of a lower average number of shares outstanding.
Within Core adjustments, restructuring costs and amortisation were 
broadly in line with last year’s level. Non-core intangible impairments 
and legal provisions were significantly reduced from 2010. In 2011, 
Core adjustments also included the profit on the sale of our dental and 
healthcare subsidiary Astra Tech. Excluded from Core results were: 
>   Impairment charges of $22 million (2010: $568 million), arising  
from impairments of assets capitalised as part of the  
MedImmune acquisition. 
>   $135 million (2010: $612 million) of legal provision charges in  
respect of the ongoing Seroquel product liability litigation, Average 
Wholesale Price litigation in the US and the Toprol-XL antitrust 
litigation. In line with prior years these have been excluded from  
our Core performance and full details of these matters are included 
in Note 25 to the Financial Statements from page 184.
>   Restructuring costs totalling $1,161 million (2010: $1,202 million), 
incurred as the Group continues its previously announced  
efficiency programmes. 
>   Amortisation totalling $537 million (2010: $518 million) relating to 
assets capitalised as part of the MedImmune acquisition and the 
Merck exit arrangements. 
>   Profit on sale of our subsidiary Astra Tech of $1,483 million. On 
31 August, we completed the sale of Astra Tech to DENTSPLY 
International Inc. for a net cash consideration of $1,772 million. 
Further details of this disposal are included in Note 22 to the 
Financial Statements on page 170.
Reported operating profit was up 10% at CER (Reported: 11%) at 
$12,795 million, largely as a result of the impact of the profit on the 
disposal of Astra Tech. Reported EPS were $7.33, up 29% (Reported: 
31%), as a result of the same factors affecting Core EPS along with the 
profit recognised on the disposal of Astra Tech. 
Net finance expense was $428 million, against $517 million in 2010, 
due to reduced interest payable on lower debt balances ($46 million) 
and a lower net pension interest expense of $55 million principally due 
to increased pension assets held by our defined benefit schemes.
The 2011 taxation charge of $2,351 million (2010: $2,896 million) 
consists of a current tax charge of $2,578 million (2010: $3,435 million) 
and a credit arising from movements on deferred tax of $227 million 
(2010: $539 million). 
The current year tax charge includes a prior period current tax credit 
of $102 million (2010: charge of $370 million). The reported effective 
tax rate for the year was 19.0% (2010: 26.4%). The reported effective 
tax rate has benefited from the non-taxable gain on the disposal of 
Astra Tech and an adjustment in respect of prior periods following the 
announcement in March 2011 that HM Revenue & Customs in the UK 
and the US Internal Revenue Service (IRS) agreed the terms of an 
Advance Pricing Agreement regarding transfer pricing arrangements 
for AstraZeneca’s US business for the period from 2002 to the end of 
2014 and a related valuation matter as detailed more fully in Note 4 to 
the Financial Statements from page 152. Excluding these benefits, the 
effective tax rate for the year was 26.4% on a reported basis. This 
26.4% tax rate is applied to the taxable Core adjustments to operating 
profit, resulting in a Core effective tax rate for the year of 22.0% 
including the benefit of the Advanced Pricing Agreement and related 
valuation matter settlement. A description of our tax exposures is set 
out in Note 25 to the Financial Statements on page 189. 
Total comprehensive income for the year increased by $1,364 million 
from 2010 to $9,470 million. This was driven by the increase in profit 
for the year of $1,935 million, offset by a decrease of $571 million in 
other comprehensive income, principally due to $741 million of 
actuarial losses on our defined benefit schemes arising from lower 
discount rates being applied to our long-term pension obligations 
reflecting external market conditions.
Cash flow and liquidity – 2011 
All data in this section is on a Reported basis. 
Cash generated from operating activities was $7 ,821 million in the year  
to 31 December 2011, compared with $10,680 million in 2010. The 
decrease of $2,859 million is primarily driven by higher tax payments 
made this year, including a net amount of $1.1 billion in relation to the 
Advance Pricing Agreement between the UK and US governments’ tax 
authorities and the settlement of a related valuation matter, an increase  
in trade and other receivables and higher contributions made to our UK 
defined benefit pension fund. 
Investment cash inflows of $577 million include the sale of Astra Tech 
($1,772 million). Cash outflows on the purchase of tangible fixed assets 
amounted to $839 million in the year, in line with 2010. Further details 
of the Astra Tech disposal are included in Note 22 to the Financial 
Statements from page 170.
Net cash distributions to shareholders increased from $5,471 million  
in 2010 to $9,370 million in 2011 through dividend payments of  
$3,764 million and net share repurchases of $5,606 million, a 
significant increase on 2010 repurchases of $2,110 million. This  
reflects the Board’s 2010 stated objective of $4 billion share 
repurchases in 2011, with the target increased in 2011 following  
the Board’s decision to use the net proceeds from the Astra Tech  
sale to increase share repurchases.

In 2011, net assets increased by $62 million to $23,472 million. The 
increase in net assets as a result of the Group profit of $10,016 million 
was offset by dividends of $3,752 million and share repurchases of 
$6,015 million. 
Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment decreased by $532 million to  
$6,425 million. Additions of $807 million (2010: $808 million) were 
offset by depreciation of $1,086 million (2010: $1,076 million) and 
disposals of $233 million (2010: $73 million), including $151 million  
of assets on the sale of Astra Tech.
Goodwill and intangible assets
Our goodwill of $9,862 million (2010: $9,871 million) principally arose 
on the acquisition of MedImmune and the restructuring of our US joint 
venture with Merck in 1998. No goodwill has been capitalised in 2011.
Intangible assets amounted to $10,980 million at 31 December  
2011 (2010: $12,158 million). Intangible asset additions were  
$442 million in 2011 (2010: $1,791 million), amortisation was  
$911 million (2010: $810 million) and impairments totalled $553 million 
(2010: $833 million). $113 million of assets were disposed of on the  
sale of Astra Tech.
Intangible asset impairment charges recorded in 2011 include  
$285 million following the termination of development of olaparib  
for the maintenance treatment of serous ovarian cancer and an 
impairment of $150 million reflecting a lower probability of success 
assessment for TC-5214, based on the results of the first two of four 
Phase III efficacy and tolerability studies. See pages 72 and 68 
respectively of the Therapy Area Review for more information.
Included within our intangible assets are rights we have acquired as  
a result of our Merck termination arrangements. Further details of 
these arrangements are included in Note 25 to the Financial Statements 
from page 181. 2012 is the first year that AstraZeneca may exercise 
the second (and final) option in relation to these termination 
arrangements. If the option is exercised in 2012, this will effectively  
end AstraZeneca’s relationships with, and obligations to, Merck  
(other than some residual manufacturing arrangements).
Receivables, payables and provisions
Trade receivables increased by $383 million to $6,630 million driven, 
principally, by higher gross sales in the US in December 2011 and the 
way calendar working days fell at the 2011 year end. Other receivables 
increased by $566 million to $1,237 million driven by an increase in our 
Seroquel related settlement funds. 
Included within trade receivables is approximately $650 million  
of net receivables, representing 10% of our trade receivables,  
due from customers in eurozone countries that have a sovereign  
credit rating of A or lower (Spain $300 million, Italy $270 million, 
Portugal $50 million and Greece $30 million). Within this balance is 
approximately $230 million of overdue government debt. In light of 
current market conditions, debts within these euro countries have 
been subject to enhanced monitoring and scrutiny by the Group.  
Our bad debt provisioning against these debts reflects our current 
estimate of the recoverability of these balances based on 
consideration of a number of factors such as the status of current 
negotiations, past payment history and individual countries’ budget 
constraints. In 2011, our revenue from these four countries was  
$1,113 million (Italy), $709 million (Spain), $305 million (Greece) and 
$223 million (Portugal).
Trade and other payables increased by $326 million in 2011, driven by 
increases in accruals of $177 million and rebates and chargebacks  
of $446 million, offset by a decrease in other payables of $215 million. 
The increase in rebates and chargebacks arose principally from 
increased managed-care and group purchasing organisation rebates. 
Further details of the movements on rebates and chargebacks are 
included on page 94.
The movement in provisions of $76 million in 2011 includes $716 million 
of additional charges recorded in the year, offset by $657 million of 
cash payments. Included within the $716 million of charges for the 
year is $135 million in respect of legal charges and $450 million for our 
global restructuring initiative. Cash payments of $657 million include 
$377 million against our ongoing global restructuring initiatives and 
$153 million related to legal matters. Further details of the charges 
made against our provisions are contained in Notes 17 and 25 to the 
Financial Statements.
AstraZeneca Annual Report and Form 20-F Information 2011 88 Financial Review Tax payable and receivable
Net income tax payable has decreased by $1,521 million to  
$2,334 million, principally due to the payment of a net amount of  
$1.1 billion in relation to the Advance Pricing Agreement between  
the UK and US governments’ tax authorities and the settlement of a 
related valuation matter. Our tax receivable balance of $1,056 million 
largely comprises tax owing to AstraZeneca from certain governments 
expected to be received on settlements of transfer pricing audits and 
disputes (see Note 25 to the Financial Statements on page 189). Net 
deferred tax liabilities reduced by $449 million in the year. 
Retirement benefit obligations
Net retirement benefit obligations increased by $202 million, due to an 
increase in post-retirement scheme obligations of $954 million driven 
by a reduction in the discount rate applied to long-term scheme 
obligations, reflecting present market conditions for corporate bonds, 
offset by pension fund employer contributions made in the year of 
$733 million (2010: $469 million) as detailed in Note 18 to the Financial 
Statements from page 165. 
In recent years the Group has undertaken several initiatives to reduce 
its net pension obligation exposure. For the UK defined benefit 
pension scheme, which represents AstraZeneca’s largest defined 
benefit scheme, these initiatives have included agreeing funding 
principles for cash contributions to be paid to the UK pension scheme 
to target a level of assets in excess of the current expected cost of 
providing benefits, and, in 2010, amendments to the scheme to freeze 
pensionable pay at 30 June 2010 levels (reducing the pension fund 
obligation by $693 million). In addition to the cash contributions to be 
paid into the UK pension scheme, AstraZeneca makes contributions 
to an escrow account which is held outside the pension scheme.  
The escrow account assets are payable to the fund in agreed 
circumstances, for example, in the event of AstraZeneca and the 
pension fund trustee agreeing on a change to the current long-term 
investment strategy.
AstraZeneca has agreed to fund the UK defined benefit scheme 
shortfall by making lump sum payments totalling £715 million  
($1,103 million) before 30 June 2013. The first of these lump sum 
payments of £180 million ($278 million) was paid into the pension 
scheme from the escrow account in December 2011. A further  
£300 million ($463 million) was paid into the pension scheme during 
January 2012 with the balance payable by 30 June 2013. In 2011, 
£132 million ($213 million) was paid into the escrow account and a 
further £230 million ($355 million) was paid in during January 2012.  
At 31 December 2011, $296 million escrow fund assets are included 
within other investments (as detailed in Note 10 to the Financial 
Statements on page 160).
In 2011, approximately 96.7% (2010: 96.5%) of the Group’s obligations 
were concentrated in the UK, the US, Sweden and Germany. Further 
details of the Group’s pension schemes are included in Note 18 to the 
Financial Statements from page 165.
Commitments and contingencies
The Group has commitments and contingencies which are accounted 
for in accordance with the accounting policies described in the 
Financial Statements in the Group Accounting Policies section from 
page 146. The Group also has taxation contingencies. These are 
described in the Taxation section in the Critical accounting policies 
and estimates section on page 97 and in Note 25 to the Financial 
Statements from page 189.
Research and development collaboration payments
Details of future potential research and development collaboration 
payments are also included in Note 25 to the Financial Statements 
from page 181. As detailed in Note 25, payments to our collaboration 
partners may not become payable due to the inherent uncertainty in 
achieving the development and revenue milestones linked to the future 
payments. As part of our overall externalisation strategy, we may enter 
into further collaboration projects in the future that may include 
milestone payments and, therefore, as certain milestone payments fail 
to crystallise due to, for example, development not proceeding, they 
may be replaced by potential payments under new collaborations.
Investments, divestments and capital expenditure 
As detailed earlier in the Research and Development section from 
page 30, AstraZeneca views collaborations, including externalisation 
arrangements in the field of research and development, as a crucial 
element of the development of our business.
The Group has completed over 90 major externalisation transactions 
over the past three years, one of which was a business acquisition 
and all others were strategic alliances and collaborations. Details of 
our business acquisitions and disposals in the past three years are 
contained in Note 22 to the Financial Statements from page 170. 
Details of our significant externalisation transactions are given below:
>   In January 2007, AstraZeneca signed an exclusive co-development 
and co-promotion agreement with BMS for the development and 
commercialisation of saxagliptin, a dipeptidyl peptidase IV inhibitor 
(DPP-IV) and dapagliflozin, a selective sodium-glucose co-
transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor, both for the treatment of Type 2 
diabetes. The agreement is global with the exception of Japan for 
saxagliptin. Under each agreement the two companies jointly 
develop the clinical and marketing strategy and share development 
and commercialisation expenses on a global basis. To date, 
AstraZeneca has made upfront and milestone payments totalling 
$300 million for saxagliptin and $170 million for dapagliflozin and 
may make future milestone payments of $230 million on 
dapagliflozin contingent on achievement of regulatory milestones 
and launch in key markets. Following launch, profits and losses 
globally are shared equally and an additional $300 million of 
sales-related payments for each product may be triggered based 
on worldwide sales success. The Group made milestone payments 
to BMS of $120 million in 2011, $50 million in 2010 and $150 million 
in 2009.
>   In December 2009, AstraZeneca and Targacept entered into an 
in-licence agreement for AstraZeneca to obtain exclusive global 
development and commercialisation rights to Targacept’s 
investigational product for major depressive disorder (MDD), 
TC-5214. Under the deal, AstraZeneca made an upfront payment of 
$200 million and may make milestone payments to a maximum of 
$540 million up to launch. In addition, Targacept will be entitled to 
receive royalties on worldwide product sales and further milestone 
payments linked to worldwide product sales. As detailed in Note 9 
to the Financial Statements from page 158, the carrying value of the 
intangible asset in relation to TC-5214, was impaired by $150 million 
in 2011 based on the results of the first two of four Phase III efficacy 
and tolerability studies of the compound.
The Group determines the above externalisation transactions  
to be significant using a range of factors. We look at the specific 
circumstances of the individual externalisation arrangement and apply 
several quantitative and qualitative criteria. Because we consider our 
externalisation strategy to be an extension of our R&D strategy, the 
expected total value of development payments under the transaction 
and its proportion of our annual R&D spend, both of which are proxies 
for overall research and development effort and cost, are important 
elements of the significance determination. Other quantitative criteria 
we apply include, without limitation, expected levels of future sales,  
the possible value of milestone payments and the resources used  
for commercialisation activities (for example, the number of staff). 
Qualitative factors we consider include, without limitation, new  
market developments, new territories, new areas of research and 
strategic implications.
In aggregate, milestones capitalised under the Group’s other 
externalisation arrangements totalled $123 million in 2011, $337 million 
in 2010 and $306 million in 2009, and the Group recognised other 
income in respect of other externalisation arrangements totalling  
$18 million in 2011, $82 million in 2010 and $440 million in 2009.

Capitalisation
The total number of shares in issue at 31 December 2011 was  
1,292 million. 10.7 million shares were issued in consideration of  
share option exercises for a total of $409 million. Share repurchases 
amounted to 127.4 million Ordinary Shares at a cost of $6,015 million. 
Shareholders’ equity increased by a net $33 million to $23,246 million 
at the year end. Non-controlling interests increased to $226 million 
(2010: $197 million).
Dividend and share repurchases
In recognition of the Group’s strong balance sheet, sustainable 
significant cash flow and the Board’s confidence in the strategic 
direction and long-term prospects for the business, the Board has 
adopted a progressive dividend policy, intending to maintain or grow 
the dividend each year.
The Board has recommended a 5% increase in the second interim 
dividend to $1.95 (123.6 pence, 13.21 SEK) to be paid on 19 March 
2012. This brings the full year dividend to $2.80 (175.5 pence per 
share, 18.54 SEK), an increase of 10%.
In 2010, the Group recommenced its share repurchase programme. 
The Group completed net share repurchases of $5,606 million in 2011 
(2010: $2,110 million). The Board has announced that the Group intends 
to complete net share repurchases in the amount of $4.5 billion during 
2012, subject to market conditions and business needs.
In setting the distribution policy and the overall financial strategy, the 
Board’s aim is to continue to strike a balance between the interests  
of the business, our financial creditors and our shareholders. After 
providing for business investment, funding the progressive dividend 
policy and meeting our debt service obligations, the Board will keep 
under review the opportunity to return cash in excess of these 
requirements to shareholders through periodic share repurchases.
Future prospects 
As described earlier in our Annual Report, the coming years will be 
challenging for the industry and for AstraZeneca as its revenue base 
transitions through a period of exclusivity losses and new product 
launches. AstraZeneca makes high-level planning assumptions for 
revenue evolution, margins, cash flow and business reinvestment to 
help guide the management of the business. 
AstraZeneca assumes that the global biopharmaceutical industry  
can grow at least in line with real GDP over the planning horizon.  
While downward pressures on revenue from government interventions 
in the marketplace have intensified, AstraZeneca’s assessment 
remains that, as yet, these do not yet constitute a sustained ‘step-
change’ in trend. The assumptions going forward for revenue, margins 
and cash flow assume no material mergers, acquisitions or disposals. 
In addition, our plans assume no premature loss of exclusivity for key 
AstraZeneca products.
It is expected that revenue in 2012 will continue to be affected  
by government interventions on pricing, and ongoing generic 
competition, including the anticipated loss of market exclusivity for 
Seroquel IR and Atacand in global markets, as well as for Crestor 
in Canada. 
Over the last several years, the Group has undertaken significant 
restructuring initiatives aimed at reshaping the cost base to improve 
long-term competitiveness. The second phase of restructuring,  
which was announced in January 2010, comprised a significant 
change programme in R&D as well as additional productivity 
improvement initiatives in the supply chain and SG&A. The first two 
phases of the restructuring programme are now largely complete at  
a cumulative cost of $4.6 billion. This programme will deliver annual 
benefits to the Group by 2014. In February 2012, the Group 
announced the next phase of restructuring. Further details are set  
out in the Our strategic priorities to 2014 section from page 21.
A planning assumption remains that continued productivity 
improvements (including successful completion of restructuring 
initiatives), will aid the achievement of levels of revenue and margins  
to generate the requisite operating cash flow over the planning period 
to support the reinvestment needs of the business, debt service 
obligations and shareholder distributions.

Business Review
Financial Review 91 Results of operations – summary analysis  
of year to 31 December 2010 continued
2010 revenue was unchanged (Reported: up 1%). Revenue in 2010 
benefited from strong growth of Crestor, Symbicort and Seroquel 
offset by lower revenues for Pulmicort, Arimidex and Casodex and the 
absence of H1N1 vaccine revenue. Emerging Markets sales growth of 
16% (Reported: 19%) and Established ROW 7% (Reported: 17%) was 
offset by a decline in US sales of 7% (Reported: 7%) with sales in 
Western Europe up 2% (Reported: down 1%). Further details of our 
sales performance are contained in the Performance 2010 sections  
of the Therapy Area Review from page 56.
Core gross margin in 2010 of 81.2% declined 1.6 percentage points 
(Reported: 1.8 percentage points). The impairment of lesogaberan,  
the 2009 benefit from the release of a provision with respect to the 
resolution of an issue related to a third party supply contract, higher 
royalties and adverse regional and product mix were only partially 
offset by lower payments to Merck.
Core R&D expenditure in 2010 was $4,219 million, 4% lower than 
2009 (Reported: 3%). Increased investment in biologics was more 
than offset by lower project costs and operational efficiencies. The 
lower project costs in 2010 were the result of several late stage 
projects completing their trials, partially offset by the commencement 
of Phase III programmes for TC-5214 and fostamatinib. 
2010 Core SG&A costs of $9,777 million were 2% lower than 2009 
(Reported: 1%). Investment in Emerging Markets and recently 
launched brands were more than offset by operational efficiencies 
across Established Markets.
Core other income of $910 million in 2010 was $16 million less than 
2009. 2009 benefited from disposal gains related to Abraxane
TM 
and 
the Nordic OTC business and 2010 included royalties from sales of 
Teva’s generic version of Pulmicort Respules.
Core pre-R&D operating margin was 53.5% in 2010, down 1.0 
percentage points (Reported: 1.2 percentage points), with the lower 
gross margin only partially offset by efficiencies within selling, general 
and administrative areas.
2010 Core operating profit was $13,603 million, unchanged at CER. 
2010 Core operating margin declined by 0.4 percentage points to 
40.8%, with lower R&D expense and operational efficiencies only 
partially offsetting the decline in the gross margin. 
Core EPS were $6.71 in 2010, up 5% (Reported: 6%), with the 
operating performance boosted by lower net finance expense, the 
benefit of a lower average number of shares outstanding and a lower 
effective tax rate. 
Core adjustments in 2010 were broadly in line with 2009, with 
increased restructuring costs and intangible impairments offset by 
gains chiefly attributable to changes in the Group’s UK pension 
arrangements. Excluded from Core in 2010 were: 
>   Impairment charges of $568 million, arising from impairments in 
respect of motavizumab ($445 million) and our HPV cervical cancer 
vaccine income stream ($123 million), both capitalised as part of the 
MedImmune acquisition. Total impairment charges relating to 
intangible fixed assets were $833 million in 2010.
>  $612 million of legal settlements, of which $592 million was in 
respect of the ongoing Seroquel product liability litigation and state 
attorney general investigations into sales and marketing practices  
in aggregate. In line with prior years these have been excluded from 
our Core performance.
>   Restructuring costs totalling $1,202 million, incurred as the Group 
continues its previously announced efficiency programmes. 
>   Amortisation totalling $518 million relating to assets capitalised as 
part of the MedImmune acquisition and the Merck exit arrangements. 
>   A credit of $791 million chiefly attributable to a curtailment gain 
related to changes made to benefits under the Group’s UK pension 
arrangements. In 2010, we amended our UK defined benefit fund. 
Pensionable pay was frozen at its 30 June 2010 level but the 
defined benefit fund remains open to existing members. Members 
of the pension fund were given the option of remaining in the fund  
or leaving the fund. Those that chose to leave the fund were offered 
funding which they could contribute to a new Group Self Invested 
Personal Pension Plan. This change to the UK defined benefit 
scheme represented an accounting curtailment of certain pension 
obligations and, in accordance with IAS 19 ‘Employee Benefits’, 
these obligations were revalued by the scheme actuaries 
immediately prior to the curtailment and the assumptions updated 
at that date.
2010 operating profit was down 1% at CER (Reported: unchanged)  
at $11,494 million. Basic EPS were $5.60, up 7% (Reported: 8%), as  
a result of the factors affecting Core EPS. 
Net finance expense was $517 million in 2010, versus $736 million  
in 2009. Fair value gains of $5 million were recorded on long-term 
bonds in 2010, versus fair value losses of $145 million for 2009. In 
addition to this, there was reduced interest payable on lower debt 
balances, and slightly increased returns from higher cash and cash 
equivalent balances.
The 2010 taxation charge of $2,896 million (2009: $3,263 million) 
consisted of a current tax charge of $3,435 million (2009: $3,105 million) 
and a credit arising from movements on deferred tax of $539 million 
(2009: charge of $158 million). The 2010 current year tax charge 
included a prior period current tax adjustment of $370 million (2009: 
$251 million) relating mainly to an increase in provisions for tax 
contingencies and double tax relief, partially offset by a benefit of  
$342 million arising from a number of tax settlements and tax  
accrual to tax return adjustments. The 2009 prior period current tax 
adjustments related mainly to tax accrual to tax return adjustments,  
an increase in provisions in respect of a number of transfer pricing 
audits and double tax relief. The effective tax rate for 2010 was 26.4% 
(2009: 30.2%, 28.8% excluding the impact of legal provisions). 
Total comprehensive income for 2010 increased by $616 million from 
2009. This was driven by the increase in profit of $537 million and an 
increase of $79 million in other comprehensive income.
Cash flow and liquidity – 2010 
All data in this section is on a Reported basis. 
Cash generated from operating activities was $10,680 million in the 
year to 31 December 2010, compared with $11,739 million in 2009. 
The decline of $1,059 million was primarily driven by legal settlements 
of $709 million relating to Seroquel sales and marketing practices and 
product liability and Average Wholesale Price Litigation in the US, and 
the first instalment of $562 million (£350 million) in respect of the UK 
tax settlement. 
Investments cash outflows of $2,236 million in 2010 included the 
acquisition of Novexel ($348 million), the payment of $647 million  
to Merck (resulting in the Group acquiring Merck’s interest in certain 
AstraZeneca products) and a further $537 million paid out on  
other externalisation arrangements. Cash outflows on the purchase  
of tangible fixed assets amounted to $791 million in 2010. Further 
details of the Novexel business acquisition and our arrangements  
with Merck are included in Note 22 and Note 25 to the Financial 
Statements respectively.
Net cash distributions to shareholders increased from $2,842 million  
in 2009 to $5,471 million in 2010 through dividend payments of  
$3,361 million and net share repurchases of $2,110 million.
Financial Review
AstraZeneca Annual Report and Form 20-F Information 2011 92 Financial Review At 31 December 2010, outstanding gross debt (interest-bearing loans 
and borrowings) was $9,222 million (2009: $11,063 million). The 
reduction in gross debt of $1,841 million during 2010 was principally 
due to the repayment, on maturity, of euro bonds of euro 500 million 
and euro 750 million. The first repayment was the euro 500 million 
18 month bond issued in July 2008 and maturing in January 2010, 
and the second was the euro 750 million 3 year bond issued in 
November 2007 and maturing in November 2010. Of the gross debt 
outstanding at 31 December 2010, $125 million was due within one 
year (2009: $1,926 million). Strong business cash flows improved net 
funds by $3,118 million, resulting in net funds of $3,653 million at 
31 December 2010.
Financial position – 2010
All data in this section is on a Reported basis.
In 2010, net assets increased by $2,589 million to $23,410 million.  
The increase in net assets as a result of the Group profit of  
$8,081 million was offset by dividends of $3,494 million and share 
repurchases of $2,604 million. Shares issued in 2010 increased  
net assets by $494 million.
Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment decreased by $350 million to  
$6,957 million as at 31 December 2010. Additions of $808 million 
(2009: $967 million) were offset by depreciation of $1,076 million 
(2009: $893 million).
Goodwill and intangible assets
Our goodwill of $9,871 million (2009: $9,889 million) principally arose 
on the acquisition of MedImmune and on the restructuring of our  
US joint venture with Merck in 1998. No goodwill was capitalised in 
2010; the movement of $18 million in 2010 being due to exchange  
rate movements.
Intangible assets amounted to $12,158 million at 31 December  
2010 (2009: $12,226 million). Intangible assets additions were  
$1,791 million in 2010 (2009: $1,003 million), amortisation was  
$810 million (2009: $729 million) and impairments totalled  
$833 million (2009: $415 million). 
Additions to intangible assets in 2010 included $647 million paid to 
Merck under pre-existing arrangements under which Merck’s interest 
in our products in the US will be terminated and $548 million from  
our acquisition of Novexel (of which $239 million of intangible assets 
acquired were subsequently sold to Forest as detailed in Note 22 to 
the Financial Statements).
Intangible asset impairment charges recorded in 2010 included  
$445 million following our decision to withdraw our FDA biological 
license application for motavizumab and $128 million related to our 
decision to discontinue further development of lesogaberan. The 2010 
impairment balance also included $123 million following reassessment 
of the licensing income generated by the HPV cervical cancer vaccine 
and $126 million written off other products in development.
Receivables, payables and provisions
In 2010, exchange rate movements contributed $119 million of the 
overall increase of $138 million in receivables with an increase in  
the trade receivables balance being offset by a reduction on other 
receivables mainly due to a reduction in our Seroquel related 
insurance receivable balance during the year. Trade and other 
payables increased by $103 million. 
The movement in provisions of $252 million in 2010 included  
$1,361 million of additional charges recorded in 2010, offset by  
$1,109 million of cash payments. Included within the $1,361 million  
of charges in 2010 was $592 million in respect of the ongoing 
Seroquel product liability litigation and state attorney general 
investigations into sales and marketing practices in aggregate  
and $497 million for our global restructuring initiative. Cash payments 
of $1,109 million included $335 million against our global restructuring 
initiative and $709 million related to legal provisions.
Tax payable and receivable
Net income tax payable in 2010 increased by $1,002 million to  
$3,855 million, principally due to an increase in accruals for tax 
contingencies, cash tax timing differences and exchange rate 
movements. Tax receivable largely comprised tax owing to AstraZeneca 
from certain governments expected to be received on settlements of 
transfer pricing audits and disputes. Net deferred tax liabilities reduced 
by $285 million in 2010. This movement included a reclassification 
from deferred tax to current tax of amounts provided in relation to  
tax contingencies for prior periods.
Retirement benefit obligations
Net retirement benefit obligations reduced by $882 million in 2010, 
principally as a result of recognising a gain of $791 million arising  
from changes made to benefits under certain of the Group’s post-
retirement benefits plans, chiefly the Group’s UK pension plan. 
Financial risk management
Financial risk management policies
Insurance
Our risk management processes are described in the Managing risk 
section from page 129. These processes enable us to identify risks 
that can be partly or entirely mitigated through the use of insurance. 
We negotiate best available premium rates with insurance providers 
on the basis of our extensive risk management procedures. In the 
current insurance market, the level of cover is decreasing while 
premium rates are increasing. Rather than simply paying higher 
premiums for lower cover, we focus our insurance resources on the 
most critical areas, or where there is a legal requirement, and where 
we can get best value for money. Risks to which we pay particular 
attention include business interruption, Directors’ and Officers’ liability 
and property damage. Recently, insurance for product liability has not 
been available on commercially acceptable terms and the Group has 
not held product liability insurance since February 2006.
Taxation
Tax risk management forms an integrated part of the Group risk 
management processes. Our tax strategy is to manage tax risks and 
tax costs in a manner consistent with shareholders’ best long-term 
interests, taking into account both economic and reputational factors. 
We draw a distinction between tax planning using artificial structures 
and optimising tax treatment of business transactions, and we engage 
only in the latter.
Treasury
The principal financial risks to which the Group is exposed are  
those arising from liquidity, interest rate, foreign currency and credit. 
The Group has a centralised treasury function to manage these  
risks in accordance with Board-approved policies. Specifically,  
liquidity risk is managed through maintaining access to a number  
of sources of funding to meet anticipated funding requirements, 
including committed bank facilities and cash resources. Interest  
rate risk is managed through maintaining a debt portfolio that is 
weighted towards fixed rates of interest. Accordingly, the Group’s  
net interest charge is not significantly affected by movements in 
floating rates of interest. We do not currently hedge the impact on 
earnings and cash flow of changes in exchange rates, with the 
exception of the currency exposure that arises between the booking 
and settlement dates on non-local currency purchases and sales  
by subsidiaries and the external dividend. Credit risk is managed 
through setting and monitoring credit limits appropriate for the 
assessed risk of the counterparty.
Our capital and risk management objectives and policies are 
described in further detail in Note 23 to the Financial Statements  
from page 171 and in the Risk section from page 129.
AstraZeneca Annual Report and Form 20-F Information 2011
Business Review
Financial Review 93 Sensitivity analysis of the Group’s exposure to exchange rate and 
interest rate movements is also detailed in Note 23 to the Financial 
Statements from page 171.
Critical accounting policies and estimates
Our Financial Statements are prepared in accordance with IFRSs as 
adopted by the EU (adopted IFRS) and as issued by the IASB, and the 
accounting policies employed are set out in the Group Accounting 
Policies section in the Financial Statements from page 146. In applying 
these policies, we make estimates and assumptions that affect the 
reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent 
assets and liabilities. The actual outcome could differ from those 
estimates. Some of these policies require a high level of judgement 
because the areas are especially subjective or complex. We believe 
that the most critical accounting policies and significant areas of 
judgement and estimation are in:
>  Revenue recognition 
>  Research and development 
>  Impairment testing of goodwill and intangible assets 
>  Litigation 
> Post-retirement benefits 
> Taxation.
Revenue recognition
Revenue is recorded at the invoiced amount (excluding inter-company 
sales and value added taxes) less movements in estimated accruals 
for rebates and chargebacks given to managed-care and other 
customers and product returns – a particular feature in the US. The 
impact in the rest of the world is not significant. It is the Group’s policy 
to offer a credit note for all returns and to destroy all returned stock in 
all markets. Cash discounts for prompt payment are also deducted 
from sales. Revenue is recognised at the point of delivery, which is 
usually when title passes to the customer either on shipment or on 
receipt of goods by the customer depending on local trading terms. 
Income from royalties and from disposals of IP, brands and product 
lines is included in other operating income.
Rebates, chargebacks and returns in the US
When invoicing sales in the US, we estimate the rebates and 
chargebacks that we expect to pay. These rebates typically arise  
from sales contracts with third party managed-care organisations, 
hospitals, long-term care facilities, group purchasing organisations 
and various federal or state programmes (Medicaid ‘best price’ 
contracts, supplemental rebates etc). They can be classified  
as follows:
>   Chargebacks, where we enter into arrangements under which 
certain parties, typically hospitals, the Department of Veterans 
Affairs, Public Health Service Covered Entities and the Department 
of Defense, are able to buy products from wholesalers at the lower 
prices we have contracted with them. The chargeback is the 
difference between the price we invoice to the wholesaler and the 
contracted price charged by the wholesaler. Chargebacks are paid 
directly to the wholesalers.
>   Regulatory, including Medicaid and other federal and state 
programmes, where we pay rebates based on the specific terms of 
agreements with the US Department of Health and Human Services 
and with individual states, which include product usage and 
information on best prices and average market prices benchmarks.
>   Contractual, under which entities such as third party managed-care 
organisations, long-term care facilities and group purchasing 
organisations are entitled to rebates depending on specified 
performance provisions, which vary from contract to contract.
The effects of these deductions on our US pharmaceuticals revenue 
and the movements on US pharmaceuticals revenue provisions are 
set out below.
Accrual assumptions are built up on a product-by-product and 
customer-by-customer basis, taking into account specific contract 
provisions coupled with expected performance, and are then 
aggregated into a weighted average rebate accrual rate for each of our 
products. Accrual rates are reviewed and adjusted on a monthly basis. 
There may be further adjustments when actual rebates are invoiced 
based on utilisation information submitted to us (in the case of 
contractual rebates) and claims/invoices are received (in the case of 
regulatory rebates and chargebacks). We believe that we have made 
reasonable estimates for future rebates using a similar methodology  
to that of previous years. Inevitably, however, such estimates involve 
judgements on aggregate future sales levels, segment mix and the 
customer’s contractual performance.

The large increase in managed-care and group purchasing 
organisation rebates in 2011 is principally driven by the impacts of  
the Affordable Care Act. See page 78 of the Geographical Review  
for more information.
Cash discounts are offered to customers to encourage prompt 
payment. Accruals are calculated based on historical experience  
and are adjusted to reflect actual experience.
Industry practice in the US allows wholesalers and pharmacies to 
return unused stocks within six months of, and up to 12 months after, 
shelf-life expiry. The customer is credited for the returned product by 
the issuance of a credit note. Returned product is not exchanged for 
product from inventory and once a return claim has been determined 
to be valid and a credit note has been issued to the customer, the 
returned goods are destroyed. At the point of sale in the US, we 
estimate the quantity and value of goods which may ultimately be 
returned. Our returns accruals in the US are based on actual 
experience. Our estimate is based on the preceding 12 months for 
established products together with market-related information, such 
as estimated stock levels at wholesalers and competitor activity, which 
we receive via third party information services. For newly launched 
products, we use rates based on our experience with similar products 
or a pre-determined percentage.
For products facing generic competition (such as Arimidex and 
Toprol-XL/Seloken in the US) our experience is that we usually lose the 
ability to estimate the levels of returns from wholesalers with the same 
degree of precision that we can for products still subject to patent 
protection. This is because we have limited or no insight into a number 
of areas: the actual timing of the generic launch (for example, a generic 
manufacturer may or may not have produced adequate pre-launch 
inventory); the pricing and marketing strategy of the competitor; the 
take-up of the generic; and (in cases where a generic manufacturer 
has approval to launch only one dose size in a market of several dose 
sizes) the likely level of switching from one dose to another. Under our 
accounting policy, revenue is recognised only when the amount of  
the revenue can be measured reliably. Our approach in meeting this 
condition for products facing generic competition will vary from 
product to product depending on the specific circumstances.
The closing adjustment in respect of prior years benefited 2011 net  
US pharmaceuticals revenue by 1.1% (2010: increased revenue by 
1.1%; 2009: increased revenue by 0.8%). However, taking into account 
the adjustments affecting both the current and the prior year, 2010 
revenue was not impacted by adjustments between years and 2009 
revenue benefited by 0.3%.
We have distribution service agreements with major wholesaler buyers 
which serve to reduce the speculative purchasing behaviour of the 
wholesalers and reduce short-term fluctuations in the level of inventory 
they hold. We do not offer any incentives to encourage wholesaler 
speculative buying and attempt, where possible, to restrict shipments 
to underlying demand when such speculation occurs.
Sales of intangible assets
A consequence of charging all internal R&D expenditure to the income 
statement in the year in which it is incurred (which is normal practice  
in the pharmaceutical industry) is that we own valuable intangible 
assets which are not recorded on the balance sheet. We also own 
acquired intangible assets which are included on the balance sheet. 
As a consequence of regular reviews of product strategy, from time  
to time we sell such assets and generate income. Sales of product 
lines are often accompanied by an agreement on our part to continue 
manufacturing the relevant product for a reasonable period (often 
about two years) while the purchaser constructs its own manufacturing 
facilities. The contracts typically involve the receipt of an upfront 
payment, which the contract attributes to the sale of the intangible 
assets, and ongoing receipts, which the contract attributes to the  
sale of the product we manufacture. In cases where the transaction 
has two or more components, we account for the delivered item  
(for example, the transfer of title to the intangible asset) as a separate 
unit of accounting and record revenue on delivery of that component 
provided that we can make a reasonable estimate of the fair value  
of the undelivered component. Where the fair market value of the 
undelivered component (for example, a manufacturing agreement) 
exceeds the contracted price for that component, we defer an 
appropriate element of the upfront consideration and amortise this 
AstraZeneca Annual Report and Form 20-F Information 2011
Business Review
Financial Review 95 over the performance period. However, where the fair market value of 
the undelivered component is equal to or lower than the contracted 
price for that component, we treat the whole of the upfront amount  
as being attributable to the delivered intangible assets and recognise 
that part of the revenue upon delivery. No element of the contracted 
revenue related to the undelivered component is allocated to the sale 
of the intangible asset. This is because the contracted revenue relating 
to the undelivered component is contingent on future events (such as 
sales) and so cannot be anticipated.
Research and development
Our business is underpinned by our marketed products and 
development portfolio. The R&D expenditure on internal activities to 
generate these products is generally charged to profit in the year that 
it is incurred. Purchases of IP and product rights to supplement our 
R&D portfolio are capitalised as intangible assets. Further details of 
this policy are included in the Group Accounting Policies section  
of our Financial Statements from page 146. Such intangible assets are 
amortised from the launch of the underlying products and are tested 
for impairment both before and after launch. This policy is in line with 
practice adopted by major pharmaceutical companies.
Impairment testing of goodwill and intangible assets
We have significant investments in goodwill and intangible assets as  
a result of acquisitions of businesses and purchases of assets, such 
as product development and marketing rights.
Details of the estimates and assumptions we make in our annual 
impairment testing of goodwill are included in Note 8 to the Financial 
Statements on page 157. No impairment of goodwill was identified.
Impairment reviews have been carried out on all intangible assets  
that are in development (and not being amortised), all major intangible 
assets acquired during the year and all intangible assets that have had 
indications of impairment during the year. Sales forecasts and specific 
allocated costs (which have both been subject to appropriate senior 
management sign-off) are discounted using appropriate rates based 
on AstraZeneca’s risk-adjusted pre-tax weighted average cost of 
capital. In building to the range of rates used in our internal investment 
appraisal of future projects and capital investment decisions, we 
adjust our weighted average cost of capital for other factors, which 
reflect, without limitation, local matters such as risk on a case by  
case basis.
Intangible asset impairment charges recorded in 2011 included  
$285 million following the termination of development of olaparib  
for the maintenance treatment of serous ovarian cancer and an 
impairment of $150 million reflecting a lower probability of success 
assessment for TC-5214, based on the results of the first two of four 
Phase III efficacy and tolerability studies. See pages 72 and 68 
respectively of the Therapy Area Review for more information. 
The majority of our investments in intangible assets and goodwill  
arose from the restructuring of the joint venture with Merck in 1998, 
the acquisition of MedImmune in 2007 and the payments to partially 
retire Merck’s interests in our products in the US in 2008 and 2010. 
We are satisfied that the carrying values at 31 December 2011 are  
fully justified by estimated future cash flows. The accounting for our 
arrangements with Merck is fully explained in Note 25 to the Financial 
Statements from page 181.
Further details of the estimates and assumptions we make in 
impairment testing of intangible assets are included in Note 9 to  
the Financial Statements from page 158.
Litigation
In the normal course of business, contingent liabilities may arise from 
product-specific and general legal proceedings, from guarantees or 
from environmental liabilities connected with our current or former 
sites. Where we believe that potential liabilities have a less than 50% 
probability of crystallising or where we are unable to make a 
reasonable estimate of the liability, we treat them as contingent 
liabilities. These are not provided for but are disclosed in Note 25  
to the Financial Statements from page 181.
In cases that have been settled or adjudicated, or where quantifiable 
fines and penalties have been assessed and which are not subject  
to appeal (or other similar forms of relief), or where a loss is probable 
(more than 50% assessed probability) and we are able to make a 
reasonable estimate of the loss, we indicate the loss absorbed or  
the amount of the provision accrued.
Where it is considered that the Group is more likely than not to prevail, 
or in the rare circumstances where the amount of the legal liability 
cannot be estimated reliably, legal costs involved in defending the 
claim are charged to profit as they are incurred. Where it is considered 
that the Group has a valid contract which provides the right to 
reimbursement (from insurance or otherwise) of legal costs and/or  
all or part of any loss incurred or for which a provision has been 
established and we consider recovery to be virtually certain, then  
the best estimate of the amount expected to be received is recognised 
as an asset.
Assessments as to whether or not to recognise provisions or assets 
and of the amounts concerned usually involve a series of complex 
judgements about future events and can rely heavily on estimates  
and assumptions. AstraZeneca believes that the provisions recorded 
are adequate based on currently available information and that the 
insurance recoveries recorded will be received. However, given the 
inherent uncertainties involved in assessing the outcomes of these 
cases and in estimating the amount of the potential losses and the 
associated insurance recoveries, we could in future periods incur 
judgments or insurance settlements that could have a material 
adverse effect on our results in any particular period.
The position could change over time, and there can, therefore, be no 
assurance that any losses that result from the outcome of any legal 
proceedings will not exceed the amount of the provisions that have 
been booked in the accounts.
Although there can be no assurance regarding the outcome of legal 
proceedings, we do not currently expect them to have a material 
adverse effect on our financial position, but they could significantly 
affect our financial results in any particular period.
Post-retirement benefits
We offer post-retirement benefit plans which cover many of our 
employees around the world. In keeping with local terms and 
conditions, most of these plans are ‘defined contribution’ in nature, 
where the resulting income statement charge is fixed at a set level  
or is a set percentage of employees’ pay. However, several plans, 
mainly in the UK (which has by far the largest single scheme), the US 
and Sweden, are defined benefit plans where benefits are based on 
employees’ length of service and final salary (typically averaged over 
one, three or five years). The UK and US defined benefit schemes 
were closed to new entrants in 2000. All new employees in these 
countries are offered defined contribution schemes. As detailed in 
Note 18 to the Financial Statements from page 165, the benefits 
provided by the UK pension plan were also modified during 2010. 
Financial Review
AstraZeneca Annual Report and Form 20-F Information 2011 96 Financial Review In applying IAS 19, we recognise all actuarial gains and losses 
immediately through reserves. This methodology results in a less 
volatile income statement charge than under the alternative approach 
of recognising actuarial gains and losses over time. Investment 
decisions in respect of defined benefit schemes are based on 
underlying actuarial and economic circumstances with the intention  
of ensuring that the schemes have sufficient assets to meet liabilities 
as they fall due, rather than meeting accounting requirements. The 
trustees follow a strategy of awarding mandates to specialist, active 
investment managers, which results in a broad diversification of 
investment styles and asset classes. The investment approach is 
intended to produce less volatility in the plan asset returns.
In assessing the discount rate applied to the obligations, we have 
used rates on AA corporate bonds with durations corresponding to 
the maturities of those obligations except in Sweden where we have 
used rates on government bonds as the market in high quality bonds 
is insufficiently deep.
In all cases, the pension costs recorded in the Financial Statements 
are assessed in accordance with the advice of independent qualified 
actuaries but require the exercise of significant judgement in relation to 
assumptions for future salary and pension increases, long-term price 
inflation and investment returns.
Taxation
Accruals for tax contingencies require management to make 
judgements and estimates in relation to tax audit issues and 
exposures. Amounts accrued are based on management’s 
interpretation of country-specific tax law and the likelihood of 
settlement. Tax benefits are not recognised unless the tax positions 
are probable of being sustained. Once considered to be probable, 
management reviews each material tax benefit to assess whether  
a provision should be taken against full recognition of the benefit on  
the basis of potential settlement through negotiation and/or litigation. 
All such provisions are included in current liabilities. Any recorded 
exposure to interest on tax liabilities is provided for in the tax charge.
AstraZeneca faces a number of transfer pricing audits in jurisdictions 
around the world and, in some cases, is in dispute with the tax 
authorities. These disputes usually result in taxable profits being 
increased in one territory and correspondingly decreased in another. 
Our balance sheet positions for these matters reflect appropriate 
corresponding relief in the territories affected.
Further details of the estimates and assumptions we make in 
determining our recorded liability for transfer pricing audits and other 
tax contingencies are included in the tax section of Note 25 to the 
Financial Statements on page 189.
Sarbanes-Oxley Act Section 404
As a consequence of our NYSE listing, AstraZeneca is required  
to comply with those provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act applicable 
to foreign issuers. Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires 
companies annually to assess and make public statements about the 
quality and effectiveness of their internal control over financial reporting.
Our approach to the assessment has been to select key transaction 
and financial reporting processes in our largest operating units and  
a number of specialist areas, such as financial consolidation and 
reporting, treasury operations and taxation, so that, in aggregate,  
we have covered a significant proportion of each of the key line  
items in our Financial Statements. Each of these operating units and 
specialist areas has ensured that its relevant processes and controls 
are documented to appropriate standards, taking into account, in 
particular, the guidance provided by the SEC. We have also reviewed 
the structure and operation of our ‘entity level’ control environment. 
This refers to the overarching control environment, including structure 
of reviews, checks and balances that are essential to the management 
of a well-controlled business.
The Directors have concluded that our internal control over financial 
reporting is effective at 31 December 2011 and the assessment is  
set out in the Directors’ Responsibilities for, and Report on, Internal 
Control over Financial Reporting on page 140. KPMG Audit Plc  
has audited the effectiveness of our internal control over financial 
reporting at 31 December 2011 and, as noted in the Auditor’s Reports 
on the Financial Statements and on Internal Control over Financial 
Reporting (Sarbanes-Oxley Act Section 404) on page 141, their report 
is unqualified.

Fighting the rise of  
cardiovascular disease
According to some studies, up to 50% of people in certain Gulf states are affected 
by high cholesterol. To fight this, we have launched a unique educational programme, 
called ‘Safe @ Heart’, designed to bring together all stakeholders to improve  
awareness and reduce cholesterol levels.
In 2009, a partnership between local cardiac societies 
and AstraZeneca launched the first large observational 
study of its kind (CEPHEUS) in the Gulf states and 
Saudi Arabia. It analysed the current management of 
cholesterol treatment among more than 5,000 adult 
patients being treated with statins. Preliminary results 
showed that 50% of the studied population did not 
reach their cholesterol treatment goals.
The Safe @ Heart programme is a practical response 
to this issue, taking a holistic, society-wide approach 
to driving improvements. The programme includes 
working with physicians to stress the importance of 
reaching cholesterol goals and helping them improve 
cholesterol management. It works with patients, carers 
and the general public to increase awareness and 
promote treatment adherence and lifestyle changes. 
We are also working with health authorities and 
governments in the fight against the rise of 
cardiovascular disease in the region.

AstraZeneca Annual Report and Form 20-F Information 2011 102 Board of Directors and Senior Executive Team The principles set out in the UK Corporate 
Governance Code remain the primary standards 
and guidance for corporate governance within 
AstraZeneca. The Board, its Committees and 
individual Directors apply those principles in all 
aspects of their work.
The Board’s Committees play an essential role in good governance. 
Under the chairmanship of Michele Hooper and John Varley 
respectively, the Audit Committee and the Remuneration Committee 
carry significant workloads and discharge their responsibilities on 
behalf of the Board with rigour and diligence. More information  
about their work is set out in the report that follows and in the 
Directors’ Remuneration Report. As Chairman of the Nomination  
and Governance Committee, I believe we have made good progress 
in recent years in succession planning at Board and senior executive 
level. Our work includes paying attention to the composition of  
the Board and its Committees, consideration of both planned and 
unplanned succession scenarios and recognition of the importance  
of gender and other diversity in good governance. For reasons of 
confidentiality, it is often not possible to report in detail on much  
of this work.
The Board itself is mindful of the need to monitor its own performance 
and improve it where we can. We approach each annual performance 
evaluation of the Board and its Committees with an open mind. While 
reassured by the results of the evaluation in 2011, which was facilitated 
by external consultants, the report that follows summarises areas for 
further improvement, which include expanding the role played by the 
Science Committee in assurance work under the competent and 
committed chairmanship of Nancy Rothwell.
Louis Schweitzer
Chairman 
In this part of the Annual Report, we explain our 
approach to corporate governance and describe, 
in general terms, how our business is organised 
and managed.
Corporate governance
We have prepared this Annual Report with reference to the UK 
Corporate Governance Code published by the UK Financial Reporting 
Council (FRC) in May 2010. This Corporate Governance Report 
(together with other sections of this Annual Report) describes how  
we apply the main principles of good governance in the UK Corporate 
Governance Code. We have complied throughout the accounting 
period with the provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code, 
which is available on the FRC’s website, frc.co.uk.
Leadership
The roles of Chairman and CEO are split. Louis Schweitzer, our 
Non-Executive Chairman, is responsible for leadership of the  
Board. Our CEO, David Brennan, leads the SET and has executive 
responsibility for running our business. The Board comprises nine 
Non-Executive Directors, including the Chairman, and two Executive 
Directors – the CEO and the CFO, Simon Lowth.
All Directors are collectively responsible for our long-term success.  
In addition, the Non-Executive Directors are responsible for exercising 
independent, objective judgement in respect of Board decisions and 
for scrutinising and challenging the actions of executive management.
The Board runs an annual strategy review process. The CEO, the CFO 
and the SET take the lead in developing our strategy, which is then 
reviewed, constructively challenged and approved by the Board.
Michele Hooper, who joined the Board as a Non-Executive Director  
in 2003, was appointed as our senior independent Non-Executive 
Director in April 2007. The role of the senior independent Non-
Executive Director is to provide a sounding board for the Chairman 
and to serve as an intermediary for the other Directors when 
necessary. The senior independent Non-Executive Director is also 
available to shareholders if they have concerns that contact through 
the normal channels of Chairman or Executive Directors has failed  
to resolve, or for which such contact is inappropriate. 
There are four principal Board Committees: the Audit Committee;  
the Remuneration Committee; the Nomination and Governance 
Committee; and the Science Committee. The membership and work 
of these Committees is described below. In addition, there may from 
time to time be constituted ad hoc Board Committees for specific 
projects or tasks. In these cases, the scope and responsibilities of the 
Committee are documented. The Board provides adequate resources 
to enable each Committee to undertake its duties.
Reserved matters and delegation of authority
The Board maintains and periodically reviews a list of matters that  
are reserved to, and can only be approved by, the Board. These 
include: the appointment, termination and remuneration of any 
Director; approval of the annual budget; any item of fixed capital 
expenditure or any proposal for the acquisition or disposal of an 
investment or business which exceeds $150 million; the raising of 
capital or loans by the Company (subject to certain exceptions); the 
giving of any guarantee in respect of any borrowing of the Company; 
and allotting shares of the Company. The matters that have not  
been expressly reserved to the Board are either delegated by the 
Board to its Committees or to the CEO.
The CEO is responsible to the Board for the management, 
development and performance of our business in relation to those 
matters in respect of which he has been delegated authority from  
the Board.
Although the CEO retains full responsibility for the authority delegated 
to him by the Board, he has established and chairs the SET, which is 
the vehicle through which he exercises certain of that authority in 
respect of our business.
The roles of the Board, the Board Committees, the Chairman, the 
CEO and the SET are documented, as are the Board’s delegated 
authorities and reserved powers.

Corporate Governance Corporate Governance Report
Operation of the Board
The Board is responsible for setting our strategy and policies, 
oversight of risk and corporate governance, and also monitors 
progress towards meeting our objectives and annual plans. The Board 
discharges these responsibilities through a programme of meetings 
that includes regular reviews of financial performance and critical 
business issues, and the formal annual strategy review day. The  
Board also aims to ensure that a good dialogue with our shareholders 
takes place and that their issues and concerns are understood  
and considered.
The Board held seven meetings and its annual strategy review day  
in 2011. With the exception of two Board meetings in September and 
the strategy day in the same month, which were held at our site in 
Wilmington in the US, all the meetings took place in London, UK.  
The Board is currently scheduled to meet six times and hold a strategy 
review day in 2012, and will meet at such other times as may be 
required to conduct business.
As part of the business of each Board meeting, the CEO typically 
submits a progress report on each key business area, giving details  
of progress against the goals the Board has approved. To ensure  
that the Board has good visibility of the key operating decisions of  
the business, members of the SET routinely attend Board meetings  
on a rotational basis and Board members regularly meet other  
senior executives throughout the year. The Board also receives 
accounting and other management information about our resources, 
and presentations from internal and external speakers on legal, 
governance and regulatory developments. At the end of Board 
meetings, the Non-Executive Directors meet without the Executive 
Directors present to review and discuss any matters that have arisen 
during the meeting and/or such other matters as may appear to the 
Non-Executive Directors to be relevant in properly discharging their 
duty to act independently.
Board effectiveness
Composition of the Board, succession planning and diversity
The Nomination and Governance Committee and, where appropriate, 
the full Board regularly review the composition of the Board and the 
status of succession to both senior executive management and 
Board-level positions. Directors have regular contact with, and access 
to, succession candidates for senior executive management positions.
The Board aims to maintain a balance in terms of the range of 
experience and skills of individual Board members, which includes 
relevant international business, pharmaceutical industry and financial 
experience, as well as appropriate scientific and regulatory knowledge. 
The biographies of Board members set out from pages 100 to  
101 give more information about current Directors in this respect.  
The Board views gender, nationality and cultural diversity among 
Board members as important considerations when reviewing the 
composition of the Board. The Board recognises, in particular, the 
importance of the debate about gender diversity, prompted by the 
publication in the UK in February 2011 of the report by Lord Davies, 
‘Women on Boards’. Since the formation of AstraZeneca in 1999, the 
proportion of women Board members has been approximately 25% 
and the Board intends to continue with its current approach to 
diversity in all its aspects, while at the same time seeking Board 
members of the highest calibre and with the necessary experience 
and skills to meet the needs of the Company and its shareholders. 
Information about our approach to diversity in the organisation below 
Board-level can be found in the People section on page 41. 
The following changes to the composition of the Board have occurred 
during the period covered by this Annual Report:
>  Shriti Vadera was appointed as a Non-Executive Director and a 
member of the Audit Committee with effect from 1 January 2011.
>  Jane Henney, a Non-Executive Director, retired from the Board on 
28 April 2011.
Independence of the Non-Executive Directors
During 2011, the Board considered the independence of each 
Non-Executive Director for the purposes of the UK Corporate 
Governance Code and the corporate governance listing standards  
of the NYSE (Listing Standards). With the exception of Marcus 
Wallenberg, the Board considers that all of the Non-Executive 
Directors are independent. Louis Schweitzer was considered by  
the Board to be independent upon his appointment as Chairman; 
in accordance with the UK Corporate Governance Code, the test  
of independence is not appropriate in relation to the Chairman after  
his appointment.
Marcus Wallenberg was appointed as a Director of Astra in May  
1989 and subsequently became a Director of the Company in 1999. 
Until September 2005, he was a member of the board of directors  
and the Chief Executive Officer of Investor AB, which has a 4.02% 
interest in the issued share capital of the Company as at 2 February 
2012. Wallenberg family foundations remain Investor AB’s largest 
shareholders in terms of votes controlled. For these reasons, the 
Board does not believe that Marcus Wallenberg can be determined 
independent under the UK Corporate Governance Code. However, 
the Board believes that he has brought, and continues to bring, 
considerable business experience and makes a valuable contribution 
to the work of the Board. In April 2010, Marcus Wallenberg was 
appointed by the Board as a member of the Science Committee, 
reflecting his interest in innovation and R&D, knowledge of the history 
of the Company and its scientific heritage and culture, and his broad 
experience of other industries and businesses in which innovation and 
R&D are important determinants of success. 
The Board has also considered, in particular, the position of Michele 
Hooper who joined the board of UnitedHealth Group as a Non-
Executive Director in 2007. The Board’s approval of this appointment 
was conditional on Michele Hooper resigning from the board of 
UnitedHealth Group in the event of a conflict or non-independence.  
It is the Board’s view that Michele Hooper is independent and that  
she discharges her duties in a properly independent manner, 
constructively and appropriately challenging the Executive Directors 
and the Board.
Conflicts of interest
The Articles enable the Directors to authorise any situation in which  
a Director has an interest that conflicts or has the potential to  
conflict with the Company’s interests and which would otherwise be  
a breach of the Director’s duty, under section 175 of the Companies 
Act 2006. The Board has a formal system in place for Directors to 
declare such situations to be considered for authorisation by those 
Directors who have no interest in the matter being considered. In 
deciding whether to authorise a situation, the non-conflicted Directors 
must act in the way they consider, in good faith, would be most likely 
to promote the success of the Company, and they may impose limits 
or conditions when giving the authorisation, or subsequently, if they 
think this is appropriate. Situations considered by the Board and 
authorisations given are recorded in the Board minutes and in a 
register of conflicts maintained by the Company Secretary and 
reviewed annually by the Board. The Board considers that this  
system continues to operate effectively.
Appointments to the Board
The Nomination and Governance Committee section on page 109 
gives information about the appointment process for new Directors.
Newly appointed Directors are provided with comprehensive 
documentation containing information about the Group and their  
role as Non-Executive Directors. They also typically attend tailored 
induction programmes that take account of their individual skills 
and experience.
AstraZeneca Annual Report and Form 20-F Information 2011 104 Corporate Governance Report Time commitment
Our expectation is that Non-Executive Directors should be prepared 
to commit about 15 days per annum, as a minimum, to the Group’s 
business. In practice, Board members’ time commitment usually 
exceeds this minimum expectation when all the work that they 
undertake for the Group is considered, particularly in the case of the 
Chairman of the Board and the Chairmen of the Board Committees. 
As well as their work in relation to formal Board and Board Committee 
meetings, the Non-Executive Directors also commit time throughout 
the year to meetings and telephone calls with various levels of 
executive management, visits to AstraZeneca’s sites throughout the 
world and, for new Non-Executive Directors, induction sessions  
and site visits. The Audit Committee section from page 107 contains 
information about Audit Committee members’ visits to our business  
in Brazil, Russia and China during 2011. In addition, Board or Board 
Committee meetings were held at our sites in Wilmington, US, 
Gaithersburg, US, Mölndal, Sweden, and Alderley Park, UK during  
the year.
On occasions when a Director is unavoidably absent from a Board  
or Board Committee meeting, for example through illness or where a 
meeting clashes with his or her existing commitments, he or she still 
receives and reviews the papers for the meeting and typically provides 
verbal or written input ahead of the meeting, usually through the 
Chairman of the Board or the Chairman of the Board Committee, so 
that his or her views are made known and considered at the meeting. 
In addition, given the nature of the business to be conducted, some 
Board meetings are convened at short notice, which can make it 
difficult for some Directors to attend due to prior commitments.
Information and support
The Company Secretary is responsible to the Chairman for ensuring 
that all Board and Board Committee meetings are properly conducted, 
that the Directors receive appropriate information prior to meetings to 
enable them to make an effective contribution, and that governance 
requirements are considered and implemented.
The Company maintained directors’ and officers’ liability insurance 
cover throughout 2011. The Directors are also able to obtain 
independent legal advice at the expense of the Company, as 
necessary, in their capacity as Directors.
The Company has entered into a deed of indemnity in favour of each 
Board member since 2006. These deeds of indemnity are still in force 
and provide that the Company shall indemnify the Directors to the 
fullest extent permitted by law and the Articles, in respect of all losses 
arising out of, or in connection with, the execution of their powers, 
duties and responsibilities, as Directors of the Company or any of its 
subsidiaries. This is in line with current market practice and helps us 
attract and retain high-quality, skilled Directors.
Performance evaluation
During the year, the Board conducted the annual evaluation of its  
own performance and that of its Committees and individual Directors. 
The review was facilitated by an external consultancy, Lintstock Ltd 
(Lintstock), a London-based corporate advisory firm that provides 
objective and independent counsel to leading European companies. 
For a number of years, Lintstock has supplied software and services 
to the Company Secretary’s team for the web-based questionnaires 
used for internal Board performance evaluations, and for the 
management of insider lists. Other than these limited instances, 
Lintstock is not a supplier to the Company and was able to act  
as a robust and independent external facilitator for the Board 
performance evaluation.
The 2011 evaluation involved a series of web-based questionnaires 
and individual meetings between Lintstock and each Board member. 
Lintstock then prepared and discussed with the Chairman and the 
Company Secretary a draft report of their findings. The final report 
was circulated to the full Board and discussed at the Board meeting 
held in December. The evaluation covered a range of topics, including: 
the composition of the Board; the effectiveness of its strategic 
oversight; Board members’ involvement in the affairs of the Company 
outside Board meetings; decision making and time management; the 
nature and quality of the information and general support provided to 
the Board; its approach to risk management and oversight of internal 
controls; and succession planning and how effectively it prioritises 
matters. Separate questionnaires covered the operation and 
effectiveness of the Board’s committees.
The review concluded that the Board operates effectively and in an 
open manner. Board members have a good level of involvement in 
matters between Board meetings. The points to be addressed arising 
from the review include further improvements in the use of the Board’s 
time in terms of Board meeting arrangements and how agenda items 
are scheduled and approached; further refinement of the composition 
of the Board over time; consideration of a short strategic update 
during the year between the annual strategy days in September; minor 
improvements to the information provided to Board members in terms 
of content and format; more involvement by the Science Committee  
in assurance work on behalf of the Board; and continuing the 
improvements made in 2011 to the review by the Board of SET-level 
succession plans.
As part of the assessment process, each Director responded to a 
questionnaire about their individual contribution to the work of the 
Board and personal development needs, following which they had 
individual discussions with the Chairman to follow up their responses. 
Each Director continues to perform effectively and to demonstrate 
commitment to the role.

Corporate Governance Corporate Governance Report
The Board’s annual performance evaluation was previously externally 
facilitated in 2008. The Board intends to continue to comply with the 
UK Corporate Governance Code guidance that the evaluation should 
be externally facilitated at least every three years.
Re-election of Directors
In accordance with Article 66 of the Articles, all Directors retire at  
each AGM and may offer themselves for re-election by shareholders. 
Accordingly, all the Directors will retire at the AGM in April 2012. The 
Notice of AGM will give details of those Directors seeking re-election.
Accountability
Risk management and internal control
The Non-Executive Directors have various responsibilities  
concerning the integrity of financial information, internal controls  
and risk management.
The Board has overall responsibility for our system of internal controls 
and risk management policies and is also responsible for reviewing 
their effectiveness. During 2011, the Directors have continued to 
review the effectiveness of our system of controls, risk management 
and our high-level internal control processes. These reviews have 
included an assessment of internal controls, and in particular, financial, 
operational and compliance controls and risk management and  
their effectiveness, supported by management assurance of the 
maintenance of controls reports from GIA, as well as the external 
auditor on matters identified in the course of its statutory audit work. 
The system is designed to manage rather than eliminate the risk of 
failure to achieve business objectives and can only provide reasonable 
(not necessarily absolute) assurance of effective operation and 
compliance with laws and regulations.
Underpinning these reviews is an annual ‘letter of assurance’ process 
by which responsible managers confirm the adequacy of their systems 
of internal financial and non-financial controls, their compliance with 
Group policies and relevant laws and regulations (including the 
industry’s regulatory requirements), and that they have reported any 
control weaknesses through our ‘continuous assurance’ process.
The internal control framework has been in operation throughout 2011 
and continues to operate up to the date of the approval of this Annual 
Report. The Directors believe that the Group maintains an effective, 
embedded system of internal controls and complies with the Turnbull 
Report guidance and, in the view of the Directors, no significant 
deficiencies have been identified in the system.
Further information about the ways in which we manage our business 
risks is set out in the Risk section from page 129, which also contains 
a list of the principal risks and uncertainties that we face.
Remuneration
Information about our approach to remuneration and the role and 
work of the Remuneration Committee, including our policy on 
executive remuneration, is set out in the Directors’ Remuneration 
Report from page 113.
Relations with shareholders
In our financial and business reporting to shareholders and other 
interested parties by means of quarterly, half-yearly and annual 
reports, we aim to present a balanced and understandable 
assessment of our strategy, financial position and prospects.
We make information about the Group available to shareholders 
through a range of media, including a fully integrated html corporate 
website, astrazeneca.com, containing a wide range of data of interest 
to institutional and private investors. We consider our website to be an 
important means of communication with our shareholders. 
The Company has been authorised by shareholders to place 
shareholder communications (such as the Notice of AGM and this 
Annual Report) on the corporate website in lieu of sending paper 
copies to shareholders (unless specifically requested by shareholders). 
While recognising and respecting the fact that some of our 
shareholders may have different preferences about how they receive 
information from us, we will continue to promote the benefits of 
electronic communication given the advantages that this has over 
traditional paper-based communications, both in terms of the 
configurability and accessibility of the information provided and the 
consequent cost savings and reduction in environmental impact 
associated with reduced printing and distribution costs.
We have frequent discussions with institutional shareholders on a 
range of issues. These include individual meetings with some of our 
largest institutional shareholders to seek their views. Board members 
are kept informed of any issues and receive regular reports and 
presentations from executive management and our brokers in order  
to assist them to develop an understanding of major shareholders’ 
views about the Group. From time to time, we conduct an audit of 
institutional shareholders to ensure that we are communicating clearly 
with them and that a high-quality dialogue is being maintained. The 
results of this audit are reported to and discussed by the full Board.  
In November, we invited corporate governance representatives from 
our largest institutional shareholders to a meeting attended by Louis 
Schweitzer, Chairman of the Board; Michele Hooper, senior 
independent Non-Executive Director and Chairman of the Audit 
Committee; John Varley, Chairman of the Remuneration Committee; 
and Rudy Markham, member of the Remuneration Committee and 
the Audit Committee. Although the meeting was primarily focused  
on executive remuneration matters, it provided an opportunity for 
shareholders to raise any broader corporate governance issues for 
discussion as well.

concerns that contact through the normal channels of Chairman, CEO 
and/or CFO has failed to resolve, or in relation to which such contact is 
inappropriate. All shareholders, including private investors, have an 
opportunity at the AGM to put questions to members of the Board 
about our operation and performance. Formal notification of the AGM 
is sent to shareholders at least one month in advance. The Chairmen 
of the Board Committees ordinarily attend the AGM to answer 
questions raised by shareholders. In line with the UK Corporate 
Governance Code, details of proxy voting by shareholders, including 
votes withheld, are given at the AGM and are posted on our website 
following the AGM.
Audit Committee
The members of the Audit Committee are Michele Hooper (Chairman 
of the Audit Committee), Jean-Philippe Courtois, Rudy Markham, 
Shriti Vadera, Bruce Burlington, and until her retirement at the 2011 
AGM, Jane Henney. They are (or in the case of Jane Henney, were) all 
Non-Executive Directors. The Board considers each member to be 
independent under the UK Corporate Governance Code and under 
the general guidance and specific criteria of the Listing Standards 
concerning the composition of audit committees applicable to non-US 
companies listed on the NYSE. In April 2011, we submitted the 
required annual written affirmation to the NYSE confirming our full 
compliance with those standards. For the purposes of the UK 
Corporate Governance Code, the Board remains satisfied that at least 
one member of the Audit Committee has recent and relevant financial 
experience. At its meeting in December, the Board determined that 
Michele Hooper and Rudy Markham are audit committee financial 
experts for the purposes of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. The Deputy 
Company Secretary acts as secretary to the Audit Committee.
The core terms of reference of the Audit Committee include, reviewing 
and reporting to the Board on:
>  Matters relating to the audit plans of the external auditor and GIA  
as well as oversight of the work of the Global Compliance function.
>  Our overall framework for internal control over financial reporting 
and for other internal controls and processes.
>  Our overall framework for risk management, particularly  
financial risks.
>  Our accounting policies and practices.
>  Our annual and quarterly financial reporting, including the critical 
estimates and judgements contained in our reporting. 
> Compliance with the Corporate Integrity Agreement (CIA).
The Audit Committee is responsible for notifying the Board of any 
significant concerns of the external auditor or the Vice-President, GIA 
arising from their audit work, any matters that may materially affect  
or impair the independence of the external auditor, any significant 
deficiencies or material weaknesses in the design or operation of our 
internal control over financial reporting or other internal controls, and  
any serious issues of non-compliance. It oversees the establishment, 
implementation and maintenance of our Code of Conduct and other 
related policies. It monitors the Company’s response to letters 
requesting information and investigations initiated by regulatory and 
governmental authorities such as the SEC and the US Department of 
Justice pertaining to matters within the remit of the Audit Committee’s 
work. It has established procedures for the receipt and handling of 
complaints concerning accounting or audit matters. It recommends  
to the Board the appointment of the external auditor, subject to the 
approval of the Company’s shareholders at a general meeting. 
Shareholders in a general meeting authorise the Directors to fix the 
remuneration of the external auditor. The Audit Committee reviews and 
approves the appointment and dismissal of the Vice-President, GIA.
The Audit Committee maintains policies and procedures for the 
pre-approval of all audit services and permitted non-audit services 
undertaken by the external auditor, the principal purpose of which  
is to ensure that the independence of the external auditor is not 
impaired. The policies and procedures cover three categories of work 
– audit services, audit-related services and tax services. The policies 
define the type of work that falls within each of these categories and 
the non-audit services that the external auditor is prohibited from 
performing under the rules of the SEC and other relevant UK and  
US professional and regulatory requirements. The pre-approval 
procedures permit certain audit, audit-related and tax services to be 
performed by the external auditor during the year, subject to fee limits 
agreed with the Audit Committee in advance. The CFO (supported by 
the Vice-President, Group Finance) monitors the status of all services 
being provided by the external auditor. The procedures also deal with 
placing non-audit work out for tender, where appropriate. Authority to 
approve work in excess of the pre-agreed fee limits is delegated to  
the Chairman of the Audit Committee in the first instance. A standing 
agenda item at Audit Committee meetings covers the operation of the 
pre-approval procedures and regular reports are provided to the full 
Audit Committee.
The Audit Committee held six scheduled meetings in 2011. The 
individual attendance record of members of the Audit Committee is 
set out in the Board and Board Committee meeting attendance in 
2011 table on page 105. Following each Audit Committee meeting,  
the Chairman of the Audit Committee reported to the Board on the 
principal matters covered at the meeting and minutes of the meetings 
were circulated to all Board members. In addition, the Chairman  
of the Audit Committee held regular scheduled calls between  
Audit Committee meetings with each of the Vice-President, GIA,  
the Chief Compliance Officer, the CFO and the lead partner of the 
external auditor.
During 2011, members of the Audit Committee met individual 
managers or groups of managers on a number of occasions in order 
to gain a deeper insight into areas relevant to the Audit Committee’s 
work and to provide an opportunity to discuss specific areas of 
interest. In particular, members of the Audit Committee travelled to our 
marketing companies in Brazil and Russia as well as to our marketing 
company, and R&D and manufacturing sites in China to meet senior 
leaders in these important Emerging Markets. During these visits, 
Audit Committee members were able to gain a greater understanding 
of the unique business and cultural dynamics of each of these markets 
and to hear how our local operations meet the challenges presented 
by these developing economies within the context of our global 
compliance framework.
During the year, in line with its normal practice, the Audit Committee 
also held a number of private meetings, without management present, 
with the Vice-President, GIA, the Global Compliance Officer (and 
following her appointment, the Chief Compliance Officer, which 
position replaced the Global Compliance Officer), the General Counsel 
and the lead partner from the Company’s external audit firm. The 
purpose of these meetings was to facilitate free and open discussions 
between Audit Committee members and those individuals, separately 
from the main sessions of the Audit Committee, which were also 
attended by the CEO, the CFO, the General Counsel and the 
Vice-President, Group Finance.

Corporate Governance Corporate Governance Report
During 2011 and January 2012, in addition to the discussions noted 
above, the Audit Committee also considered and discussed the 
following matters:
>  The key elements of the financial statements, and estimates and 
judgements contained in our financial disclosures, which were 
reviewed and various accounting matters considered. 
>  The reports received from the external auditor concerning its audit 
of the Financial Statements of the Group and from management, 
GIA, Global Compliance and the external auditor on the effectiveness 
of our system of internal controls and, in particular, our internal 
control over financial reporting. This included review and discussion 
of the results of the ‘continuous assurance’ and annual ‘letter of 
assurance’ processes. The Audit Committee also reviewed 
quarterly activity reports of audit work carried out by GIA and the 
status of follow up actions with management as well as reports from 
the Global Compliance function.
>  The systems and processes that management has developed 
pertaining to risk identification, classification and mitigation.
>  Compliance with the applicable provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley 
Act. In particular, the Audit Committee regularly reviewed the status 
of compliance with the programme of internal controls over financial 
reporting implemented pursuant to section 404 of the Sarbanes-
Oxley Act. The Audit Committee increased its focus on IS/IT 
controls in the context of the changes to the Group’s IS/IT 
environment, described below. Further information about this is set 
out in the Sarbanes-Oxley Act Section 404 section on page 97. 
>  Data about reports made by employees via the AZethics telephone 
and online facilities and other routes regarding potential breaches  
of the Code of Conduct together with the results of inquiries into 
these matters.
>  Quarterly reports received from the US Compliance Officer 
responsible for monitoring the US business’s compliance with the 
CIA (for more information about the obligations imposed on the 
Board by the CIA, see below).
>  The decision to terminate AstraZeneca’s existing outsource 
relationship for IS infrastructure services and transition to a new 
multi-sourcing operating model. In addition, regular progress 
updates from IS/IT on the status of the transition from the existing 
outsource provider to the new providers.
>  Accounting issues relevant to litigation and taxation matters.
>  Reports from the Group Treasury function and, in particular, reports 
concerning the Group’s liquidity and cash position and the 
appropriateness of its cash management policies in the context of 
the current economic situation.
>  Other reports concerning the GIA, Global Compliance and Finance 
functions, including the internal audit plan and progress and plans 
of the Global Compliance function.
>  Reports from the General Counsel on the status of certain litigation 
matters and governmental investigations.
>  The provisions of the new UK Bribery Act, the Company’s  
revised Global Anti-Bribery Policy and its Global External 
Interactions Policy. These revised policies are available on our 
website, astrazeneca.com.
>  The amount of audit and non-audit fees of the external auditor 
throughout 2011. The Audit Committee was satisfied throughout the 
year that the objectivity and independence of the external auditor 
were not in any way impaired by the nature of the non-audit work 
undertaken by the external auditor during the year, the level of 
non-audit fees charged for such work or any other facts or 
circumstances. Further information about the audit and non-audit 
fees for 2011 is disclosed in Note 27 to the Financial Statements  
on page 190.
>  A review of compensation policy across the Commercial 
organisation. This review was held with the Chairman of the 
Remuneration Committee. 
>  A review and assessment of the Audit Committee’s performance 
(including an externally facilitated review of performance) which 
concluded that such performance was satisfactory.
In addition to the quarterly reporting stipulated by the CIA as 
described above, a number of other obligations required by the CIA 
were discharged by members of the Board and the Audit Committee 
during 2011. For example, all members of the Board completed the 
annual CIA-required training, addressing the Code of Conduct and the 
elements of the CIA and the US compliance programme. Furthermore, 
the Board adopted a resolution (signed by each member) in respect  
of the first 12 month reporting period under the CIA. The resolution 
summarised the Board’s oversight of the US compliance programme 
and stated that, to the best of the Board’s knowledge, AstraZeneca 
Pharmaceuticals, LP and AstraZeneca LP (AstraZeneca’s principal  
US trading entities) have implemented an effective US compliance 
programme to meet Federal healthcare programme, FDA and  
CIA requirements. 
In line with best practice, we periodically consider how the audit 
requirements of the Group are best served in the context of business 
need and the prevailing external environment and, against the 
background of this review, consider whether to undertake a formal 
tendering programme with audit firms of appropriate size and calibre. 
In accordance with its normal practice, the Audit Committee reviewed 
a satisfaction survey and performance evaluation of our external 
auditor, which included in addition to the Audit Committee’s own 
consideration, assessment and input from key stakeholders within  
the Group. In addition, in 2011, the Audit Committee requested and 
reviewed a formal proposal from KPMG Audit Plc (KPMG) to continue 
as the Company’s auditors for the period 2012 to 2014. The Audit 
Committee considered KPMG’s compliance with the independence 
criteria under the relevant statutory, regulatory and ethical standards 
applicable to auditors and assessed its objectivity, taking into account 
the level of challenge provided around the critical estimates and 
judgements involved in our financial reporting and the quality of our 
internal control over financial reporting. Having considered all these 
factors and weighed them against its experience of working with other 
external firms, the Audit Committee unanimously recommended to  
the Board that a resolution for the re-appointment of KPMG as the 
Company’s external auditor for the year ending 31 December 2012,  
be proposed to shareholders at the AGM in April 2012. Consistent 
with current market practice, KPMG’s services to the Company are 
provided pursuant to terms of engagement which are reviewed by the 
Audit Committee. These terms of engagement do not include any 
contractual obligations under which the Directors would be prevented 
from appointing a different audit firm were they to consider this to be 
in the best interests of the Group. The Audit Committee, through 
management, continues to maintain contact and dialogue with other 
major audit firms who are familiar with the Group’s business for 
succession purposes as required. This is reported to the Audit 
Committee in order to ensure a smooth transition from the current 
auditor, should this be necessary.
At the January 2012 meeting, the CFO presented to the Audit 
Committee the conclusions of the CEO and the CFO following the 
evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and 
procedures required by Item 15(a) of Form 20-F at 31 December 2011. 
Based on their evaluation, the CEO and the CFO concluded that, as  
at that date, we maintain an effective system of disclosure controls 
and procedures.
There was no change in our internal control over financial reporting 
that occurred during the period covered by this Annual Report that 
has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our 
internal control over financial reporting.
The Audit Committee is currently scheduled to meet six times in 2012 
and will meet at such other times as may be required.
The Audit Committee’s terms of reference are available on our 
website, astrazeneca.com.
AstraZeneca Annual Report and Form 20-F Information 2011 108 Corporate Governance Report Code of Conduct 
Our Code of Conduct (the Code), which is available on our website, 
astrazeneca.com, applies to all Directors, officers, full-time, part-time, 
and temporary staff at all levels in every country where we operate. 
Further information relating to the Code can be found in the 
Compliance section on page 43. 
A Group Finance Code of Conduct complements the Code. It applies 
to the CEO, the CFO, the Group’s principal accounting officers 
(including key Finance staff in major overseas subsidiaries) and all 
Finance function employees. This reinforces the importance of the 
integrity of the Group’s Financial Statements, the reliability of the 
accounting records on which they are based and the robustness of 
the relevant controls and processes.
Remuneration Committee
The principal role of the Remuneration Committee is to consider  
and set, on behalf of the Board, the remuneration (including pension 
rights and compensation payments) of Executive Directors and other 
senior executives. It also considers and sets the remuneration of the 
Chairman, in conjunction with the senior independent Non-Executive 
Director and in the absence of the Chairman. No Director is involved  
in deciding his or her own remuneration. More information is set out in 
the Directors’ Remuneration Report from page 113.
Nomination and Governance Committee
The Nomination and Governance Committee’s role is to recommend 
to the Board any new Board appointments and to consider more 
broadly succession plans at Board-level. Any decisions relating to the 
appointment of Directors are made by the entire Board based on the 
merits of the candidates and the relevance of their background and 
experience, measured against objective criteria, with care taken to 
ensure that appointees have enough time to devote to our business. 
The Nomination and Governance Committee also advises the Board 
periodically on significant developments in corporate governance and 
the Company’s compliance with the UK Corporate Governance Code.
During 2011, the members of the Nomination and Governance 
Committee were Louis Schweitzer (Chairman of the Nomination and 
Governance Committee), Michele Hooper, John Varley, Jane Henney 
(until her retirement from the Board on 28 April 2011) and Nancy 
Rothwell (from 28 April 2011). They are all Non-Executive Directors. 
The Board considers them all to be independent. Louis Schweitzer 
was considered by the Board to be independent upon his 
appointment as Chairman, in accordance with the UK Corporate 
Governance Code, the test of independence is not appropriate in 
relation to the Chairman after his appointment. The Company Secretary 
acts as secretary to the Nomination and Governance Committee.
The Nomination and Governance Committee met four times in 2011. 
The individual attendance record of its members is set out in the 
Board and Board Committee meeting attendance in 2011 table on 
page 105. During the year, it reviewed the knowledge, experience  
and balance of the Board overall and considered its likely future 
requirements given the strategic and business objectives of the 
Company. In addition, the Nomination and Governance Committee 
received reports about the most significant corporate governance 
developments and their potential impact on the Group. 
The Nomination and Governance Committee’s terms of reference  
are available on our website, astrazeneca.com.
Science Committee
The Science Committee’s core role continues to be to provide 
assurance to the Board regarding the quality, competitiveness and 
integrity of the Group’s R&D activities by way of: meetings and dialogue 
with our R&D leaders and other scientist employees; visits to our R&D 
sites throughout the world; and review and assessment of the: 
> approaches we adopt in respect of our chosen Therapy Areas 
> scientific technology and R&D capabilities deployed 
> decision making processes for R&D projects and programmes
> quality of our scientists. 
The Science Committee also reviews, from time to time, important 
bioethical issues that we face, and assists in the formulation of, and 
agrees on behalf of the Board, appropriate policies in relation to such 
issues. It may also consider, from time to time, future trends in medical 
science and technology. The Science Committee does not review 
individual R&D projects.
During 2011, the members of the Science Committee, all of whom 
have a knowledge of, or an interest in, life sciences, were Nancy 
Rothwell (Chairman of the Science Committee), Bruce Burlington, 
Marcus Wallenberg and Jane Henney (until her retirement from the 
Board on 28 April 2011), all Non-Executive Directors. The President, 
Global R&D; the Executive Vice-President, Innovative Medicines; the 
Executive Vice-President, Biologics R&D; and the Executive Vice-
President, Global Medicines Development attend meetings of the 
Science Committee. The Vice-President, Strategy, Portfolio & 
Performance, R&D also attends all meetings and acts as secretary  
to the Science Committee.
The Science Committee met twice in 2011, at Alderley Park, UK and  
at Mölndal, Sweden. 
The Science Committee’s terms of reference are available on our 
website, astrazeneca.com.
US corporate governance requirements
Our ADSs are traded on the NYSE and, accordingly, we are subject  
to the reporting and other requirements of the SEC applicable to 
foreign private issuers. Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act 
requires companies to include in their annual report on Form 20-F filed 
with the SEC a report by management stating its responsibility for 
establishing internal control over financial reporting and to assess 
annually the effectiveness of such internal control. We have complied 
with those provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act applicable to foreign 
private issuers. The Board continues to believe that the Group has a 
sound corporate governance framework, good processes for the 
accurate and timely reporting of its financial position and results of 
operations, and an effective and robust system of internal controls.  
We have established a Disclosure Committee, further details of which 
can be found in the Disclosure Committee section on page 110.
The Directors’ assessment of the effectiveness of the internal control 
over financial reporting is set out in the Directors’ Responsibilities for, 
and Report on, Internal Control over Financial Reporting section in the 
Financial Statements on page 140.
We are required to disclose any significant ways in which our 
corporate governance practices differ from those followed by US 
companies under the Listing Standards. In addition, we must comply 
fully with the provisions of the Listing Standards relating to the 
composition, responsibilities and operation of audit committees, 
applicable to foreign private issuers. These provisions incorporate  
the rules concerning audit committees implemented by the SEC under 
the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. We have reviewed the corporate governance 
practices required to be followed by US companies under the Listing 
Standards and our corporate governance practices are generally 
consistent with those standards.

Business organisation
Senior Executive Team
The CEO has established and chairs the SET. The SET normally 
meets once a month to consider and decide major business issues,  
or as otherwise required by business needs. Typically, it also reviews, 
in advance of submission to the Board, those matters that are to be 
submitted to the Board for review and decision. Katarina Ageborg 
joined the SET as Chief Compliance Officer on 1 July 2011.
In addition to the CEO, the SET’s members are: the CFO; the 
President, Global R&D; the Executive Vice-President, Global 
Commercial Operations; the General Counsel; the Chief Compliance 
Officer; the Executive Vice-President, Human Resources & Corporate 
Affairs; and the Executive Vice-President, Operations & Information 
Services. The Company Secretary acts as secretary to the SET.
Portfolio Investment Board (PIB)
The CEO has established and chairs the PIB, a senior-level,  
cross-functional governance body, which seeks to maximise  
the value of our internal and external R&D investments through  
robust, transparent and well-informed decisions that drive  
business performance and accountability. 
Specifically, the PIB has responsibility for: 
>  Reviewing the R&D portfolio, by conducting an objective and 
transparent review of R&D performance, product launch profile and 
alignment with corporate strategy. The review is also an important 
step in reconfirming the R&D three-year budget. 
>  Approving the business plans of the Innovative Medicines Units and 
the Global Medicines Development demand forecast, by confirming 
the allocation of resources across early, and late stage elements of 
R&D as well as assessing licensing and acquisition opportunities. 
>  Approving late stage (internal and external) investment decisions.
>  Monitoring environmental events that could have a major 
transformational or disruptive impact on our business.
In addition to the CEO, the PIB’s members are: the CFO; the 
President, Global R&D; the Executive Vice-President, Global 
Commercial Operations; the Executive Vice-President, Innovative 
Medicines; the Executive Vice-President, Biologics R&D; the Executive 
Vice-President, Global Medicines Development; and the Vice-
President, Strategic Partnering & Business Development. The PIB has 
a permanent secretary and typically meets at around the time of the 
monthly SET meetings, or as otherwise required by business needs.
Disclosure Committee
Our disclosure policy provides a framework for the handling and 
disclosure of inside information and other information of interest to 
shareholders and the investment community. It also defines the role of 
the Disclosure Committee. The members of the Committee are: the 
CEO; the CFO, who chairs the Committee; the President, Global R&D; 
the General Counsel; the Vice-President, Corporate Affairs; the 
Vice-President, Investor Relations; and the Vice-President, Group 
Finance. The Deputy Company Secretary acts as secretary to this 
Committee. The Committee meets regularly to assist and inform the 
decisions of the CEO concerning inside information and its disclosure. 
Periodically, it reviews our disclosure controls and procedures and its 
own operation as part of work carried out to enable management and 
the Board to assure themselves that appropriate processes are 
operating for our planned disclosures, such as our quarterly results 
announcements and scheduled investor relations events.
Disclosure of information to auditors 
The Directors who held office at the date of approval of this Annual 
Report confirm that, so far as they are each aware, there is no relevant 
audit information of which the Company’s auditors are unaware; and 
each Director has taken all the steps that he or she ought to have 
taken as a Director to make himself or herself aware of any relevant 
audit information and to establish that the Company’s auditors are 
aware of that information.
Compliance and Group Internal Audit 
The role of the Global Compliance function is to manage and maintain 
the compliance programme infrastructure and to help embed a culture 
of ethics and integrity in the Group. Global Compliance works closely 
with GIA, with whom it provides assurance reporting to the Audit 
Committee. During 2012, the Global Compliance function will  
continue to focus on ensuring the delivery of an aligned approach  
to compliance that addresses key risk areas across the business.
During 2011, a new Chief Compliance Officer (formerly designated 
Global Compliance Officer) was appointed to head the Global 
Compliance function. The reporting of all Global Compliance 
programme resources, including regional and local compliance 
officers, is centralised under the Chief Compliance Officer who reports 
to the CEO and is a member of the SET. The Chief Compliance Officer 
heads the Global Compliance leadership team, whose remit is to 
oversee and coordinate the implementation of an effective global 
compliance programme and evaluate its effectiveness. It does this by 
assessing key compliance risks within and across the SET functions, 
working with GIA to ensure coordination of compliance auditing and 
monitoring, reviewing results, addressing significant policy violations, 
and identifying trends.
Global Compliance provides direct assurance to the Audit Committee 
on matters concerning compliance issues, with a particular focus on 
compliance with anti-bribery and anti-corruption legislation as well as 
IFPMA, EFPIA and PhRMA codes. Complementing this, GIA carries 
out a range of audits that include compliance-related audits and 
reviews of the assurance activities of other Group assurance functions. 
The results from these activities are reported to the Audit Committee.
GIA is an independent appraisal function that derives its authority from 
the Board through the Audit Committee. Its primary role is to provide 
reasonable and objective assurance to the Directors regarding the 
adequacy and effectiveness of the Group’s risk management and 
control framework and the internal controls over key business risks, 
including financial controls and compliance with laws, regulations 
and policies.
GIA seeks to discharge the responsibilities set down in its charter  
by reviewing:
>  The processes for ensuring that key business risks are effectively 
managed.
>  The financial and operational controls that help to ensure that the 
Group’s assets are properly safeguarded from losses, including 
fraud.
>  The controls that help to ensure the reliability and integrity of 
management information systems.
>  The processes for ensuring compliance with policies and 
procedures, external legislation and regulation.
In addition to fulfilling its primary remit of assurance to the Audit 
Committee, GIA acts as a source of constructive advice and best 
practice, assisting senior management to improve governance, 
control, compliance and risk management.

Distributions to shareholders and dividends for 2011 
Our distribution policy comprises both a regular cash dividend and a 
share repurchase component, further details of which are set out in 
the Financial Review on page 90 and Notes 20 and 21 to the Financial 
Statements on page 170. 
The Company’s dividends for 2011 of $2.80 (175.5 pence, SEK 18.54) 
per Ordinary Share amount to, in aggregate, a total dividend payment 
to shareholders of $3,678 million. Two of our employee share trusts, 
AstraZeneca Share Trust Limited and AstraZeneca Quest Limited, 
waive their right to a dividend on the Ordinary Shares that they hold 
and instead receive a nominal dividend.
A shareholders’ resolution was passed at the 2011 AGM authorising 
the Company to purchase its own shares. Pursuant to this resolution, 
the Company repurchased (and subsequently cancelled) 127.4 million 
Ordinary Shares with a nominal value of $0.25 each, at an aggregate 
cost of $6,015 million, representing 9.9% of the total issued share 
capital of the Company. The Company will seek a renewal of 
permission from shareholders to purchase its own shares at the  
AGM on 26 April 2012.
During our share repurchase programmes that operated between 
1999 and 2011, a total of 557.4 million Ordinary Shares were 
repurchased, and subsequently cancelled, at an average price  
of 2767 pence per share for a consideration, including expenses,  
of $26,717 million.

Information on the business environment in which we operate, 
including the factors underpinning the industry’s future growth 
prospects, are included in the section describing The pharmaceutical 
industry from page 15. Details of our product portfolio, our approach 
to product development and a summary of our development pipeline 
are included in the Business Review from page 30. Additional 
information on our Therapy Areas is included in the Therapy Area 
Review from page 56. The table showing our development pipeline 
can be found from page 199.
The financial position of the Group, our cash flows, liquidity position 
and borrowing facilities are described in the Financial Review from 
page 86. In addition, Notes 15 and 23 to the Financial Statements from 
pages 161 and 171 respectively, include our objectives, policies and 
processes for managing our capital, our financial risk management 
objectives, details of our financial instruments and hedging activities 
and our exposures to credit, market and liquidity risk. Further details

We have considerable financial resources available. At 31 December 
2011, we had $9.2 billion in financial resources (cash balances of  
$7.6 billion and committed undrawn bank facilities of $3.6 billion, with 
only $2.0 billion of debt due within one year). Our revenues are largely 
derived from sales of products which are covered by patents and for 
which, in the short term at least, demand is relatively unaffected by 
changes in the global economy. In addition, we have a wide diversity 
of customers and suppliers across different geographic areas. As a 
consequence, the Directors believe that we are well placed to 
continue to manage our business risks successfully.
The Directors have a reasonable expectation that we have adequate 
resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable 
future. Accordingly, they continue to adopt the going concern basis  
in preparing this Annual Report and the Financial Statements.
Changes in share capital 
Changes in the Company’s Ordinary Share capital during 2011, 
including details of the allotment of new shares under the Company’s 
share plans, are given in Note 20 to the Financial Statements on 
page 170.
Directors’ shareholdings 
The Articles require each Director to be the beneficial owner of 
Ordinary Shares in the Company with an aggregate nominal value of 
$125 (which currently represents at least 500 shares). Such holding 
must be obtained within two months of the date of the Director’s 
appointment. At 31 December 2011, all of the Directors complied with 
this requirement and full details of each Director’s interests in shares of 
the Company are set out in the Directors’ interests in shares section 
on page 125. Information about the shareholding expectations of the 
Remuneration Committee (in respect of Executive Directors and SET 
members) and the Board (in respect of Non-Executive Directors) is 
also set out in the Directors’ Remuneration Report from page 113.

Political donations 
Neither the Company nor its subsidiaries made any EU political 
donations or incurred any EU political expenditure in 2011 and they  
do not intend to do so in the future in respect of which shareholder 
authority is required, or for which disclosure in this Annual Report is 
required, under the Companies Act 2006. However, to enable the 
Company and its subsidiaries to continue to support interest groups 
or lobbying organisations concerned with the review of government 
policy or law reform without inadvertently breaching the Companies 
Act 2006, which defines political donations and other political 
expenditure in broad terms, a resolution will be put to shareholders  
at the 2012 AGM, similar to that passed at the 2011 AGM, to authorise 
the Company and its subsidiaries to: 
>  make donations to political parties or independent election candidates
>  make donations to political organisations other than political parties
>   incur political expenditure, up to an aggregate limit of $250,000.
Corporate political contributions in the US are permitted in defined 
circumstances under the First Amendment of the US Constitution and 
are subject to both federal and state laws and regulations. In 2011, the 
Group’s US legal entities made contributions amounting in aggregate 
to $1,099,450 (2010: $1,999,150) to national political organisations, 
state-level political party committees and to campaign committees of 
various state candidates. No corporate donations were made at the 
federal level and all contributions were made only where allowed by 
US federal and state law. We publicly disclose details of our corporate 
US political contributions, which can be found at astrazeneca-us.com/
responsibility/transparency/. The annual corporate contributions 
budget is reviewed and approved by the US General Counsel, the  
US Vice-President, Corporate Affairs and the President of our US 
business to ensure robust governance and oversight. US citizens or 
individuals holding valid green cards exercised decision making over 
the contributions and the funds were not provided or reimbursed by 
any non-US legal entity. Such contributions do not constitute political 
donations or political expenditure for the purposes of the Companies 
Act 2006 and were made without any involvement of persons or 
entities outside the US. 
Significant agreements
There are no significant agreements to which the Company is a  
party that take effect, alter or terminate on a change of control of  
the Company following a takeover bid. There are no persons with 
whom we have contractual or other arrangements, who are deemed  
by the Directors to be essential to our business.
Use of financial instruments 
Notes 15 and 23 to the Financial Statements, from pages 161  
and 171 respectively, include further information on our use of  
financial instruments.
Creditor payment policy 
It is not our policy formally to comply with the Confederation of British 
Industry’s code of practice on the prompt payment of suppliers. It is, 
however, our policy to agree appropriate payment terms with all 
suppliers when agreeing to the terms of each transaction, to ensure 
that those suppliers are made aware of the terms of payment and, 
subject to their compliance, to abide by the terms of payment. The 
total amount of money owed by the Company’s subsidiaries to trade 
creditors at the balance sheet date was equivalent to 50 days’ average 
purchases (2010: 62 days). A considerable part of the trade creditors’ 
balance continues to relate to the Merck account in the US, which has 
particularly long contractual payment terms. By removing this balance 
and other items not directly related to trade purchases in the US, a 
more accurate average of 43 days is obtained (2010: 57 days).
The Company has no external trade creditors.
Annual General Meeting 
The Company’s AGM will be held on 26 April 2012. The meeting  
place will be in London, UK. A Notice of AGM will be sent to all 
registered holders of Ordinary Shares and, where requested, to the 
beneficial holders of shares.
External auditor 
A resolution will be proposed at the AGM on 26 April 2012 for the 
re-appointment of KPMG Audit Plc as auditor of the Company.  
The external auditor has undertaken various non-audit work for us 
during 2011. More information about this work and the audit and 
non-audit fees that we have paid are set out in Note 27 to the Financial 
Statements on page 190. The external auditor is not engaged by us to 
carry out any non-audit work in respect of which it might, in the future, 
be required to express an audit opinion. As explained more fully in the 
Audit Committee section from page 107, the Audit Committee has 
established pre-approval policies and procedures for audit and 
non-audit work permitted to be carried out by the external auditor  
and has carefully monitored the objectivity and independence of the 
external auditor throughout 2011.

Bureau Veritas is an independent professional services company  
that specialises in quality, health, safety, social and environmental 
management with a long history of providing independent  
assurance services.

responsibility related information within this Annual Report and of the

AstraZeneca Annual Report and Form 20-F Information 2011 112 Corporate Governance Report Directors’ Remuneration Report
I am pleased to introduce our Directors’ 
Remuneration Report (the Report) for 201 1 for 
which we seek approval at the Company’s 
AGM in April. 
The job of the Remuneration Committee (the Committee) is to 
promote long-term, sustainable growth in shareholder value. So its 
main focus is on developing policy and remuneration decisions that 
support the Group’s strategy as a focused, integrated, innovation-
driven, global, prescription-based biopharmaceutical business. This 
involves taking careful account of the interests of our stakeholders.
As your elected representatives, our primary task is to invest 
shareholders’ money, in the form of compensation resource, wisely. 
We are mindful of the UK Corporate Governance Code’s main 
principle which guides us to award levels of remuneration that are 
sufficient to attract, retain and motivate senior employees (including 
Directors) of the quality required to run the Group successfully, while 
avoiding paying more than is necessary. This means paying close 
attention to the design of incentive arrangements for Executive 
Directors, SET members and other senior executives, as well as to 
how our pay structures operate in practice. To reinforce our objectivity, 
and to complement the objective mindset that is brought to bear  
on remuneration decisions, the Committee takes advice from  
Deloitte LLP, directly appointed by the Committee independently  
of the Company. 
Base salaries are benchmarked against relevant industry market  
data to ensure that they remain competitive, but this is not done 
blindly, continuously or in isolation; the Committee takes care also to 
consider, before making its decisions, the overall performance of the 
business and the needs of the Company in terms of its strategic and 
operational targets. We will not award increases that are not justified 
by individual performance. For incentive arrangements, the Committee 
aims to select performance criteria which are appropriate to the 
Company’s circumstances and which will promote AstraZeneca’s 
success and competitiveness in the pharmaceutical industry.  
Whether it is the combination of a balanced scorecard, cash flow  
and EPS performance for the annual bonus, or longer-term measures 
relating to shareholder value, such as TSR used in the AstraZeneca 
Performance Share Plan (PSP) and the dividend hurdles in the 
AstraZeneca Investment Plan (AZIP), we seek to establish clear and 
fair links between individual and Group performance, and appropriate 
levels of reward.
We try to keep in touch with what our shareholders are thinking. There 
is an annual opportunity for our larger investors to meet me and Board 
colleagues to share their opinions and, of course, shareholders 
express their views by way of the shareholder vote on this Report at  
the AGM in April, which is attended by many of our owners. We are 
grateful for the support that shareholders have shown for our 
approach to executive remuneration; last year, 95% of the votes cast 
by shareholders supported the 2010 Directors’ Remuneration Report. 
The Committee is also very aware of the position of employees 
throughout the Group, how the remuneration principles established by 
the Committee translate into rewards for employees, and the fairness 
of the rewards earned by Executive Directors, SET members and 
other senior executives in the overall Group context, especially in 
relation to annual salary increases. We call for, and analyse, a 
significant amount of data relating to salaries, bonus levels and 
incentive scheme awards across the Group. We also consider the 
levels of share ownership among SET members and other senior 
executives. We know that in making judgements about the pay of 
senior employees, particularly the Executive Directors, we must 
ensure that our decisions take account of the wider employee context. 
How, for example, does any percentage increase in the base pay of 
the CEO sit alongside base pay increases of junior staff? I hope that 
you can see in our decisions this year, and in the behaviour of the CEO 
himself (who has again declined an increase in base pay), that we are 
sensitive to these important issues. Before awarding an increase in 
base pay and long-term compensation opportunity to our CFO, we 
consulted widely with our major shareholders. The salary increase we 
have decided to award sits within the range of base pay increases 
awarded to the wider UK employees of the Group for 2012. Going 
forward, our intention is that any future increases for Executive 
Directors will be cost of living type increases made on an annual basis. 
In the decisions that it makes, the Committee seeks always to  
assess how these might affect AstraZeneca’s reputation. We use  
our discretion to avoid mechanistic outcomes of remuneration 
arrangements that are not justified by the prevailing circumstances, be 
it underlying financial performance or the way in which the Company 
does business. We defer awards and have the ability to use claw-back 
arrangements (where appropriate) to reinforce the importance of the 
Company’s reputation and to deter inappropriate risk taking. 
We have changed the format of the Report this year. Without reducing 
disclosure, we have sought in the first part to answer the question: 
What was paid to the Executive Directors in 2011 and why? We then 
set out extensive information of the sort that our shareholders are 
familiar with. So the Report that follows is divided into three sections. 
We start with ‘What was paid to the Executive Directors in 2011 and 
why?’. We follow this with a section headed ‘How the Remuneration 
Committee approaches its work’ that describes how we aim to 
support business strategy; link reward with performance; and exercise 
judgement. The third section describes the work of the Committee in 
2011. We conclude with an Additional information section containing 
the remainder of the information which shareholders habitually wish to 
see. We would find it useful to receive feedback from shareholders on 
this new approach in due course.
We have noted the proposals on executive remuneration announced 
in January 2012 by the UK Secretary of State for Business, Innovation 
& Skills. This Report is likely to evolve further in response to  
developing legislation. 
On behalf of the Committee, I commend this Report to you.

Directors’ Remuneration Report 113 Directors’ Remuneration Report
In this section, we have set ourselves the task of explaining, as simply 
as we can, what was paid to the Executive Directors during 2011  
and why. 
This Report has been prepared in accordance with the Large and 
Medium-sized Companies and Groups (Accounts and Reports) 
Regulations 2008 (Regulations) and meets the relevant requirements 
of the Financial Services Authority’s Listing Rules. As required by the 
Regulations, a resolution to approve this Report will be proposed at 
the AGM on 26 April 2012. 
What was paid to the Executive Directors in 2011 and why?
The summaries below set out the quantitative data for each Executive 
Director, including certain data for the preceding year to enable 
comparison. We follow this with short qualitative comments relating  
to base pay, annual bonus or Short Term Incentive (STI), Long Term 
Incentive (LTI) and benefits, including pension.

Variable elements of the CEO’s and CFO’s remuneration  
in 2011
Bonus outcomes for 2011
For Executive Directors, the principal drivers of annual bonus 
opportunity are EPS (27% weighting), cash flow (9% weighting),  
the Group scorecard (24% weighting) and the relevant SET area 
scorecards (40% weighting). In terms of the SET area scorecards,  
an average of all SET area scorecards is used for the CEO and the 
Finance scorecard is used for the CFO. The scorecards include 
categories relating to Values, Pipeline and People. At the beginning  
of 2011, the Committee set EPS, cash flow and scorecard targets 
against which the performance of the Executive Directors has been 
measured. At CER, both revenue and Core operating profit for the 
year declined by 2% and 4% respectively. This partly accounts for the 
reduction of 16% in the bonuses of the CEO and the CFO. However, 
Core EPS increased by 7%. There was strong double-digit growth for 
Crestor, Seroquel XR and Symbicort. Emerging markets sales growth 
was 10% at CER. Brilinta was approved and launched in the US and 
a number of other countries; other products made good progress 
through regulatory approvals. Both cash flow and EPS performance 
exceeded internal and external expectations. Balanced against this 
were a number of pipeline disappointments, including olaparib and 
TC-5214, which both resulted in impairment charges. The Company 
made net cash distributions to shareholders of $9,370 million by way 
of dividends and the share buy-back programme, boosted by the 
successful disposal of Astra Tech. In addition to a strong financial 
performance in a challenging environment, significant work was 
undertaken in 2011 to continue promoting a culture of responsibility, 
accountability and compliance. The Company is ranked in the top 7% 
in the sector in the Dow Jones Sustainability World and European 
Indexes, with its highest assessment score to date of 85%.
The annual bonus ranges for the CEO and the CFO in 2012 are 
unchanged from 2011. For the CEO, the range is 0-180% of base 
salary and for the CFO it is 0-150% of base salary.
Vesting of PSP awards in 2011 and 2012
The PSP share awards granted in 2008 in respect of the 2008-2010 
performance period vested during 2011 at 125% for SET members, 
including the CEO and the CFO (whose awards were based on TSR 
alone), following achievement of a relative TSR ranking of first in the 
comparator group over the performance period. The Committee  
used its discretion to determine this vesting of the maximum PSP 
award because the Company’s TSR performance was substantially 
better than that of the upper quartile of the comparator group in the 
2008-2010 performance period (a TSR of 55% for the Company 
versus 16% for the next best performing company in the  
comparator group).
The PSP share awards granted in 2009 in respect of the 2009-2011 
performance period will vest during 2012 at 78% for SET members, 
including the CEO and the CFO (whose awards were based on TSR 
alone), following achievement of a relative TSR ranking of fourth in the 
comparator group with a TSR of 35% over the performance period. 
This is in accordance with the performance measures determined by 
the Committee.
Performance under the PSP in 2011
The TSR graphs on page 124 show, for each PSP share award, how 
the Company’s TSR performance has compared with the TSR for the 
companies in the comparator group from the first day of the relevant 
performance period to 31 December 2011 and how the Company ranks 
against those other peer companies on this basis. At the end of 2011, 
the Company is on track to meet the cash flow target. We will continue 
to report on the performance of each PSP share award against the 
relevant performance target during the relevant vesting period.
Performance under the AZIP in 2011
Previously granted AZIP awards continued without lapsing as the 
full-year dividend for 2011 was $2.80 per Ordinary Share, which 
exceeded the 2009 and 2010 full-year dividends of $2.30 and  
$2.55 per Ordinary Share respectively. Dividend cover did not fall 
below the 1.5 times threshold.
How the Remuneration Committee approaches its work
Remuneration Committee membership 
The Committee members are John Varley (Chairman of the 
Committee), Rudy Markham, Louis Schweitzer and Nancy Rothwell. 
Louis Schweitzer was considered by the Board to be independent 
upon his appointment as Chairman of the Board. All other members  
of the Committee are independent Non-Executive Directors. The 
Company Secretary acts as the secretary to the Committee.
The Committee retains Deloitte LLP (Deloitte), represented by Carol 
Arrowsmith, who provided independent advice on various matters it 
considered in 2011. The cost of this service to the Company in 2011 
was £118,380 (including VAT). During the year, Deloitte also provided 
taxation advice and other specific non-audit services to the Group. 
The Committee reviewed the potential for conflicts of interest and 
judged that there were no conflicts.
Committee terms of reference
A copy of the Committee’s terms of reference is available on our 
website, astrazeneca.com.
The Committee conducted a review of its terms of reference during 
2011. A small number of changes were recommended to the Board, 
principally to reflect updated guidance issued by the Association of 
British Insurers in September 2011. The changes were approved by 
the Board in January 2012.
Supporting the business strategy
The principal role of the Committee is to develop remuneration  
policies and practices that support the implementation of our business 
strategy and help create shareholder value over time.
The remuneration components for all employees (including Executive 
Directors and SET members) comprise fixed and variable 
performance-related elements. A summary of the main components 
of remuneration is set out on page 119.
Base pay and total compensation positioning against the relevant 
market is intended to be sufficient (but no more than necessary) to 
attract, retain and develop high-calibre talent.
Variable pay forms a significant part of the overall remuneration 
opportunity for Executive Directors, SET members and other senior 
executives. It is linked to a range of measures designed to promote 
individual and team performance in a way that supports the Group’s 
success. Such measures are intended to stretch and challenge the 
relevant individuals while at the same time giving them an opportunity 
to participate as shareholders in the creation of long-term economic 
value. This is made up of three elements:
>  The annual bonus drives and rewards short-term performance 
against specific Group, functional and individual business objectives. 
>  The PSP rewards the generation of cash at levels to finance 
investment in the business, debt repayment and the Company’s 
shareholder distribution policy; and outperformance of industry 
peers in terms of shareholder value-creation measured by  
relative TSR.
>  The performance and holding periods of the AZIP are aligned to  
the Company’s product development cycle, reflecting the long-term 
investment horizons that are a feature of the industry. Dividend-
based performance hurdles motivate the generation of returns for 
shareholders on a sustainable basis over an extended period  
of time.
AstraZeneca Annual Report and Form 20-F Information 2011 116 Directors’ Remuneration Report Linking reward with performance
Executive Directors and other SET members are eligible to participate 
in different elements of variable performance-related pay, which are 
described in the Additional information section below. The decision  
as to whether or not, in any given year, they receive any or all of  
their elements of variable pay is determined by the Committee, which, 
in making such a determination, will typically have regard to the 
performance of the individual and the Group, and will consider the 
elements of variable pay applicable to senior employees in other 
comparable organisations.
The Committee works with the Audit Committee to ensure that the 
Group’s remuneration policies and practices achieve the right balance 
between appropriate incentives to reward good performance and 
managing risk in terms of employee behaviour and how the Company 
achieves its business objectives. 
The AstraZeneca annual bonus plan, in which all employees participate, 
contains goals demonstrating a commitment to distinction through 
integrity, to enhance reputation and avoid reputational damage. All LTI 
plans operated by AstraZeneca contain claw-back provisions.
Exercising judgement
The Committee believes that an essential element of its approach  
is the exercise of its judgement and discretion in determining 
remuneration in order to reflect relevant circumstances and achieve 
the right balance between the interests of the business, shareholders 
and employees. The Committee always considers the overall 
performance of the Group when using its discretion under the terms  
of AstraZeneca’s remuneration arrangements. This is to avoid 
mechanistic outcomes under the terms of any remuneration plan 
which would provide for rewards that are not justified either by 
underlying business performance or in circumstances where 
AstraZeneca has suffered reputational damage.
Aligning senior executives’ interests with those of 
shareholders
Part of the annual bonus of Executive Directors and SET members  
is deferred into shares, helping align senior executives’ interests with 
those of shareholders.
The proportion currently deferred into shares is one-third of the 
pre-tax annual bonus for Executive Directors and one-sixth for other 
SET members. The Committee reviews annually whether the 
proportion of bonus to be deferred should be changed in the light of 
market and/or best practice developments. The shares are acquired 
on the open market at the prevailing market price and held for a period 
of three years from the date of acquisition before being delivered to 
individual Executive Directors and other SET members.
In addition to partial bonus deferral, there is a requirement for 
Executive Directors and other SET members to hold shares in the 
Company. The shareholding requirement for the CEO was increased 
in January 2012 from 200% to 300% of base salary, and for the CFO 
from 125% to 200% of base salary. The requirement for all other SET 
members is 125% of base salary.
In all aspects of its work, the Committee considers both the external 
environment in which the Company operates and the guidance issued 
by organisations representing institutional shareholders. It consults the 
Company’s largest investors on general and specific remuneration 
and provides an annual opportunity for representatives of those 
investors to meet the Chairman of the Committee and other 
Committee and Board members.
Considering the wider employee context
The Committee sets overall remuneration policy and makes decisions 
about specific remuneration arrangements in the broader context of 
employee remuneration throughout the Group. The Committee 
annually reviews Group remuneration data including bonus data; 
gender and geographical data in relation to base salaries; and 
aggregate data about the shareholding levels of senior managers. In 
particular, in reviewing the base salaries of Executive Directors and 
SET members, the Committee considers the overall level of any salary 
increases being awarded to employees across the Group in the 
relevant year. 
Main work of the Remuneration Committee during the year
The Committee met five times in 2011. The individual attendance 
record of Committee members is set out on page 105. At the invitation 
of the Committee, except where their own remuneration was being 
discussed, the CEO; the Executive Vice-President, Human Resources 
& Corporate Affairs; the Global Head, Reward & Employment; and the 
Vice-President, Global Compensation attended one or more 
Committee meetings in 2011 and provided advice and services that 
materially assisted the Committee.
The work of the Committee focused on the following principal matters 
during 2011:
>  A review of the terms of senior executives’ remuneration packages 
on appointment, promotion and termination, including the 
remuneration packages on the appointment of a number of senior 
leaders in R&D.
>  The assessment of Group and individual performance against 
performance targets to determine the level of executive bonuses for 
2010 and to set executive bonus performance targets for 2011.
>  The assessment of performance against targets to determine the 
level of vesting in 2011 under the PSP and to set PSP and AZIP 
performance thresholds for awards made in 2011.
>  The determination of awards made under the Group’s main LTI 
plans: the PSP, the AZIP and the Global Restricted Stock Plan 
(GRSP) to SET members and other participants.
>  The determination of restricted share awards to a limited number of 
senior executives under the AstraZeneca Restricted Share Plan (RSP).
>  The setting of the terms of appointment of Katarina Ageborg as 
Chief Compliance Officer and a SET member.
>  A review of performance metrics used by the R&D organisation.
>  The approval of rules of a new UK all-employee savings-related 
share option scheme, which will be proposed to shareholders for 
approval at the 2012 AGM, to replace the AstraZeneca Savings-
Related Share Option Plan, which expires in 2013.
>  Jointly with the Audit Committee, a review of compensation policy 
across the Commercial organisation. 
>  The review and determination of incentive arrangements below SET 
level for a limited pool of eligible employees in the context of the 
Company’s restructuring plans in Commercial and R&D.
>  A review of Group reward data, including average salary data 
analysed by gender.
>  Consideration of the review of the Committee’s effectiveness carried 
out by the Board.
>  A benchmarking review of the Committee’s activities and policies 
against institutional investor guidelines.
>  A review of the levels of share ownership of Executive Directors, other 
SET members and senior executives immediately below SET level.
>  A review of the pension entitlements of Executive Directors and 
other SET members.
>  A review of the proportion of Executive Directors’ and SET 
members’ annual cash bonuses that are deferred into shares with  
a three-year vesting period.
>  A review of the performance of Deloitte, the independent adviser  
to the Committee.
>  The submission by the Company of a response to the executive 
remuneration discussion paper published by the UK Department  
for Business, Innovation & Skills in September 2011.
>  The preparation, review and approval (in January 2012) of this Report.

Pension arrangements
CEO’s pension arrangements
Defined benefit arrangements
David Brennan is a member of the AstraZeneca US Defined Benefit 
Pension Plan (US DBP), by virtue of his membership of pension plans 
applicable to legacy Astra Merck employees. On his appointment to 
the Board, the rules of the US DBP were amended to remove bonus 
payments from the calculation of his pensionable pay. Benefits for 
members of the US DBP are delivered on a tax-qualified basis, with 
accrued benefits that exceed specific limits under the plan’s formula 
and the US Tax Code being delivered through a supplementary, 
non-qualified plan.
The normal pension age under the US DBP is 65. However, on  
leaving or retiring from employment, David Brennan is eligible to take  
a pension or lump sum equivalent based on accrued service and final 
pensionable pay (ie without actuarial reduction) due to his satisfaction 
of a condition in the pension plan relating to the combined age and 
service exceeding 85 years.
David Brennan’s participation in the US DBP is subject to a service 
cap at 35 years’ service, which has now been attained and therefore 
service beyond 35 years is not shown in the table below. No further 
service accrual can be earned.
Members and, in the event of death, surviving spouses/dependants 
can elect, in relation to those benefits delivered on a tax-qualified basis 
under the US DBP, to take pensions in lump sum form based on 
actuarial valuation. Members or spouses/dependants may not make 
such an election in relation to any supplementary non-qualified 
benefits which must be taken in lump sum form.
Pension is payable to David Brennan in US dollars. For ease of 
understanding, the table below has been presented in both pounds 
sterling and US dollars using the exchange rates for 2011 set out on 
page 124. Transfer values are calculated to be consistent with the 
value of the lump sum distribution equivalent to his deferred accrued 
pension annually.
Defined contribution arrangements
In addition, David Brennan (as a US citizen) is a contributing member 
of the US 401(k) savings plan. He also participates in AstraZeneca’s 
Executive Deferred Compensation Plan (EDCP) which is operated as  
a supplemental non-qualified plan in respect of US employees should 
annual contributions exceed the limit applicable to contributions  
under the qualified 401(k) plan. During 2011, total employer matching 
contributions of $96,000 (£60,000) (2010: $91,000 (£59,000)) were 
made to his 401(k) plan and EDCP. Member contributions of $719,000 
(£447,000) were paid through salary sacrifice into the plans. 
In the event of a US participant becoming incapacitated, permanent 
health insurance cover will provide continuation of a proportion of 
salary, subject to the satisfaction of certain medical criteria. In the 
event of the death of a participant prior to retirement, a life assurance 
policy will provide surviving spouses/dependants with a lump sum 
equivalent to one times salary (such salary being capped at the 
maximum pensionable salary under the plan).
CFO’s pension arrangements 
Simon Lowth is eligible to join the AstraZeneca Group Self Invested 
Personal Pension (UK Defined Contribution Plan (UK DCP)) at a 
company contribution rate of 24% of annual base salary or, 
alternatively, to take the company contribution as a cash allowance. 
Since joining AstraZeneca, he has elected to take the cash allowance 
in lieu of a pension, which during 2011, amounted to £153,000 
($245,000) (2010: £149,000 ($230,000)).
In the event of a senior employee in the UK DCP (including one who 
has taken an alternative cash allowance) becoming incapacitated, 
permanent health insurance cover provides continuation of a 
proportion of salary, subject to the satisfaction of certain medical 
criteria. In the event of death prior to retirement, dependants are 
entitled to a lump sum secured from a multiple of 10 times salary 
(capped at £4.3 million).

Summary of the AstraZeneca Performance Share Plan (PSP) and the AstraZeneca Investment Plan (AZIP)
History
PSP
The PSP was approved by shareholders at the 2005 AGM and provides for the grant of performance share awards (PSP Share Awards) over Ordinary Shares or ADSs 
(together, Shares). 
AZIP
The AZIP was approved by shareholders at the 2010 AGM and provides for the grant of share awards (AZIP Share Awards) over Shares.
Basis of participation
PSP
Participation in the PSP is highly selective and usually includes only senior employees on the basis of their performance. 
Generally, PSP Share Awards can be granted at any time (although in practice they are awarded annually), but not during a close or prohibited period of the Company. In 
2011, the main grant of PSP Share Awards was made on 28 March, with a smaller grant of Share Awards approved by the Committee in relation to, for example, new 
appointments, promotions and assignments being made on 26 August. The number of Shares subject to a PSP Share Award is determined by reference to the market price 
of Shares over the three-day period immediately preceding the date of grant.
Details of PSP Share Awards granted to Executive Directors are shown in the Performance Share Plan table on page 126.
AZIP
Participation in the AZIP is highly selective and usually includes only senior employees on the basis of their performance. 
In 2011, the main grant of AZIP Share Awards was made on 28 March, with a further Share Award approved by the Committee in relation to Katarina Ageborg’s appointment 
to the SET on 26 August. The number of Shares subject to an AZIP Share Award is determined by reference to the market price of Shares over the three-day period 
immediately preceding the date of grant.
Details of AZIP Share Awards granted to Executive Directors are shown in the AstraZeneca Investment Plan table on page 126.
Individual limit
PSP
Under the PSP rules, in respect of any financial year of the Company, the maximum market value of Shares that may in theory be put under a PSP Share Award in respect of 
an employee is 500% of that employee’s base salary.
The actual individual limits that apply under the PSP, subject to this maximum, are set by the Committee from time to time.
AZIP
Under the AZIP rules, in respect of any financial year of the Company, the maximum market value of Shares that may in theory be put under an AZIP Share Award in respect 
of an employee is 500% of that employee’s base salary.
The actual individual limits that apply under the AZIP, subject to this maximum, are set by the Committee from time to time.
Performance conditions and performance targets
PSP
Other than in exceptional circumstances, which are prescribed in the PSP rules, the vesting of PSP Share Awards is contingent on the satisfaction of specified performance 
targets (balanced equally between cash flow and TSR) and continued employment with the Group. In addition to the satisfaction of these performance targets, PSP Share 
Awards will generally not vest until the third anniversary of the date of grant. 
Fifty percent of the award is based on relative TSR against a selected peer group of global pharmaceutical companies, of which:
>  25% of the maximum award vests for performance at the median of the peer group; 
>  75% of the maximum award vests for upper quartile performance; and
>  100% of the maximum award may vest at the Committee’s discretion if the Company’s TSR performance is substantially better than that of the upper quartile of the 
comparator group. For PSP Share Awards to vest at this level, the Company would need to have sustained a level of performance significantly in excess of upper quartile 
over a period of years and the Committee would need to be satisfied that this was warranted.
The peer group for the TSR measure is: Abbott, BMS, Eli Lilly & Company, GSK, Johnson & Johnson, Merck, Novartis, Pfizer, Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd and Sanofi-Aventis. 
TSR measures share price growth, and dividends reinvested in respect of a notional number of shares from the beginning of the relevant performance period to the end of it, 
and ranks the companies in the selected comparator group by reference to their TSR achieved over that period. The rank which the Company’s TSR achieves over the 
performance period will determine how many Shares will vest under the relevant PSP Share Award. Payouts against performance in relation to TSR for PSP Share Awards 
are expressed as a percentage of the maximum PSP Share Award currently payable, shown within a range of 0% to 100%. This presentation is shown in the table below.
TSR ranking of the Company Vesting %
Below median 0
Median 25
Between median and upper quartile Pro rata
Upper quartile 75
Significantly above upper quartile Up to 100
In addition to the above TSR performance target being met for each PSP Share Award, the Committee has to satisfy itself that achievement of the TSR performance target is 
a genuine reflection of the Group’s underlying financial performance. It has the discretion to prevent PSP Share Awards from vesting or only to allow them to partially vest 
where this appears to the Committee to be warranted.
Fifty percent of the award vests subject to the achievement of the free cash flow target, which operates as a cumulative cash flow target over the same three-year performance 
period as the TSR measure. 
The measure for the cash flow target is net cash flow (before distributions) and the level of vesting will be based on a sliding scale between a threshold cash flow target  
of $16 billion and an upper target of $23 billion. Twenty five percent of the relevant portion of the award will vest for achievement of the threshold target, rising on a sliding 
scale to full vesting for achievement of the upper target as shown in the table below. Net cash flow is considered to be the most appropriate measure of cash flow 
performance because it relates to the residual cash available to finance additional investment in specific business needs, debt repayments and our distribution policy.
The cash flow measure encompasses a number of important elements of operational and financial performance and helps to align executives’ rewards with shareholder value 
creation. The level of vesting of this element is based on a sliding scale against a target that is intended to represent a significant challenge for the business. It is intended that 
the Committee should have the discretion to adjust, but on an exceptional basis only, the free cash flow target during the performance period for material factors that might 
otherwise distort the performance measure in either direction. This allows performance to be assessed against targets that have been set on a consistent basis. For example, 
adjustments may be required to reflect exchange rate movements, significant acquisitions or divestments, and major legal and taxation settlements. Any major adjustments to 
the calculation are disclosed to shareholders. There is no retesting of performance.

AZIP
The AZIP is aligned to AstraZeneca’s targeted product development cycle, reflecting the long-term investment horizons that are a feature of the industry. The performance 
requirement attached to awards under the AZIP is a combination of dividend and dividend cover tests, assessed over a period of up to four financial years beginning at the 
start of the first financial year of the Company in which the award is granted. 
The AZIP is operated over a four-year performance period (Performance Period) and a four-year holding period (Holding Period). At the end of the Performance Period,  
the extent to which the performance hurdle has been met will determine the number of Shares in respect of which the AZIP Share Award will vest at the end of the  
Holding Period. 
The Committee’s intention in its choice of proposed performance tests has been to establish a performance requirement that motivates financial business performance that 
will generate returns for shareholders on a sustainable basis over an extended time period. 
The performance hurdle for Share Awards made in 2011 is that:
>  The annual dividend per share paid to holders of Ordinary Shares is increased from $2.55 over the four-year Performance Period ($2.55 being the full-year dividend for 
2010); and 
>  Dividend cover (based on reported earnings before restructuring costs) does not fall below 1.5 times.
The performance hurdle for Share Awards made in 2010 is that:
>  The annual dividend per share paid to holders of Ordinary Shares is increased from $2.30 over the period 1 January 2010 to 31 December 2013 ($2.30 being the full-year 
dividend for 2009); and 
>  Dividend cover over the same period (based on reported earnings before restructuring costs) does not fall below 1.5 times. 
Performance Period/Holding Period and vesting dates
PSP
In the case of all PSP Share Awards granted to date, the performance target relates to the three-year period commencing on 1 January of the year of grant. Therefore, for 
PSP Share Awards made in 2011, the performance period runs from 1 January 2011 to 31 December 2013. The vesting date is the third anniversary of the date of grant.
AZIP
Under the rules of the AZIP, the performance period is the period of up to eight years (and not less than three years) from 1 January of the financial year in which the AZIP 
Share Award is made. The holding period starts at the end of the performance period and ends eight years from the first day of the performance period. As described above, 
the AZIP is currently operated over a four-year performance period (Performance Period) and a four-year holding period (Holding Period).
Cessation of employment
PSP
If a participant ceases to be in relevant employment, the award will be time pro-rated and vest at the end of the Performance Period, subject to the achievement of the 
relevant performance targets measured over the entire Performance Period.
AZIP
During the Performance Period: If a participant ceases to be in employment (and also, if relevant, an Executive Director) with the Group during the Performance Period, 
his/her AZIP Share Award will generally lapse, unless his/her cessation is because of death, ill-health, injury, disability, redundancy, retirement with the agreement of his/her 
employing company, or because of a sale or transfer out of the Group (each a Good Leaver Reason). In these circumstances, the maximum number of Ordinary Shares 
comprised in an AZIP Share Award will, unless the Committee determines otherwise, be pro-rated to reflect the proportion of the period of employment between grant and 
cessation, relative to the four-year Performance Period. In circumstances where the Good Leaver Reason is death, ill-health, injury or disability (being compassionate 
circumstances), the performance hurdle will be assessed and the AZIP Share Award may vest following cessation of employment, unless the Committee determines 
otherwise. On cessation of employment for any other Good Leaver Reason, the pro-rated AZIP Share Award will remain subject to the performance hurdle, which will be 
assessed at the end of the Performance Period, unless the Committee determines that special circumstances apply, and the AZIP Share Award may then vest on the later 
of: (i) the end of the Performance Period; or (ii) 24 months after cessation of employment, unless the Committee determines otherwise. 
During the Holding Period: If a participant ceases to be in employment (and also, if relevant, an Executive Director) with the Group during the Holding Period, his/her AZIP 
Share Award will generally lapse, unless his/her cessation is because of a Good Leaver Reason. In circumstances where the Good Leaver Reason is death, ill-health, injury or 
disability (being compassionate circumstances), the AZIP Share Award will vest in respect of all the Ordinary Shares subject to the AZIP Share Award (as calculated at the end of 
the Performance Period) as soon as possible following cessation of employment. On cessation of employment for any other Good Leaver Reason, the AZIP Share Award will vest 
in respect of all the Shares subject to the AZIP Share Award (as calculated at the end of the Performance Period) on the earlier of: (i) the end of the period of 24 months from the 
date of cessation of employment; and (ii) the end of the Holding Period. The Committee does have discretion to determine otherwise if it believes the circumstances justify this.
2011 performance
PSP
The TSR graphs on page 124 compare for each PSP Share Award, the Company’s TSR performance against the TSR for companies in the comparator group from the first 
day of the relevant performance period to 31 December 2011. At the end of 2011, the Company is on track to meet the cash flow target.
AZIP
The full-year dividend was $2.80 for 2011 and dividend cover did not fall below the 1.5 times threshold.
Claw-back of Shares
PSP
In the event that an employee leaves the Company’s employment for anything other than a Good Leaver Reason, any unvested award shall lapse unless the Committee 
decides otherwise.
AZIP
The Committee can claw back some or all of the Ordinary Shares that are the subject of a participant’s AZIP Share Award at any time during the Performance Period and the 
Holding Period if, in the opinion of the Committee (acting fairly and reasonably), any of the underlying Company performance, the occurrence of an event that causes or is 
very likely to cause reputational damage to the Company, or serious misconduct by the participant, warrants the claw-back. If this discretion is exercised, the AZIP Share 
Award will be deemed to have been granted over the reduced number of Ordinary Shares. No Ordinary Shares were subject to claw-back in 2011.

Summary of other plans
AstraZeneca Share Option Plan
The Share Option Plan (SOP) was approved by shareholders for a period of 10 years and expired in May 2010. 
Details of outstanding grants of option awards (Option Awards) granted to Executive Directors are shown in the Share option plans table on page 127 .
The Committee imposed performance conditions in respect of the exercise of such Option Awards by SET members (including the Executive 
Directors) which, in the view of the Committee, were considered appropriately stretching. In order for Option Awards to vest, the EPS of the 
Group must increase at least in line with the UK Retail Prices Index plus 5% per annum on average, over a three-year period, the base figure 
being the EPS for the financial year preceding the date of grant, with no retesting. In addition, since the review of executive remuneration in 
2004, the Committee has included a condition that, if an event occurs which causes material reputational damage to the Company, such that  
it is not appropriate for the Option Awards to vest and become exercisable, the Committee can make a determination to reflect this. No such 
determination was made in 2011.
Global Restricted Stock Plan
The AstraZeneca Global Restricted Stock Plan (GRSP) was introduced in 2010 and provides for the grant of restricted stock awards (Stock 
Awards) over Shares. The GRSP is operated for below SET-level employees only.
In 2011, Stock Awards were made under the GRSP on 28 March, with other Stock Awards approved by the Committee in relation to, for 
example, new appointments, promotions and assignments being granted on 26 August. Stock Awards granted under the GRSP do not involve 
the issue and allotment of new Ordinary Shares but rather rely on the market purchase of Ordinary Shares that have already been issued. There 
is no increase in the overall quantum of awards applicable to target employees through the introduction of the GRSP. 
Restricted Share Plan
The AstraZeneca Restricted Share Plan (RSP) was introduced in 2008 and provides for the granting of restricted share awards (RS Awards)  
to key employees, excluding Executive Directors. RS Awards are made on an ad hoc basis with variable vesting dates and may not operate in 
respect of Ordinary Shares which are newly issued or transferred from treasury. The RSP was used seven times in 2011 to make RS Awards to 
a limited number of key senior executives in specific situations considered by the Committee. The Committee has responsibility for agreeing any 
RS Awards under the RSP and for setting the policy for the way in which the RSP should operate. 
Other plans
In addition to the plans described above, the Company operates the AstraZeneca Savings-Related Share Option Plan and the AstraZeneca 
All-Employee Share Plan in the UK, both of which are HM Revenue & Customs approved plans. Certain Executive Directors and other SET members 
are eligible to participate in these plans, more detailed descriptions of which can be found in Note 24 to the Financial Statements from page 176. 
Dilution under share plans
Other than the AstraZeneca Savings-Related Share Option Plan and the AstraZeneca All-Employee Share Plan, which operate in the UK only, 
and the SOP, none of the Company’s share plans has a dilutive effect because they do not involve the issue and allotment of new Ordinary 
Shares but rather rely on the market purchase of Ordinary Shares that have already been issued.
Terms of employment for Executive Directors
Service contracts
Details of the service contracts for each of the Executive Directors are set out below. Either the Company or the Executive Director may 
terminate the service contract on 12 months’ notice. It is the Committee’s intention that, in the event of early termination of an Executive 
Director’s employment, any compensation payable under his/her service contract should not exceed the salary and benefits that would have 
been received had the contractual notice period been worked and this may be further reduced in line with the Executive Director’s duty to 
mitigate losses. None of the Executive Directors has any provision in their service contracts giving them a right to liquidated damages or an 
automatic entitlement to bonus for the duration of their notice period. Compensation for any bonus entitlement will be assessed initially as  
‘on target’ but subject to adjustment by the Committee to take account of the particular circumstances of the termination.
Details of Executive Directors’ service contracts at 31 December 2011 are shown in the table below:

Policy on external appointments and retention of fees
Subject to specific Board approval in each case, Executive Directors and other SET members may accept external appointments as non-executive 
directors of other companies and retain any related fees paid to them, provided always that such external appointments are not considered  
by the Board to prevent or reduce the ability of the executive to perform their role within the Group to the required standard. Simon Lowth is a  
Non-Executive Director of Standard Chartered PLC. In respect of such position, he received fees of £105,000 for his services in 2011.
Non-Executive Directors
None of the Non-Executive Directors has a service contract but all have letters of appointment. In accordance with the Company’s Articles, 
following their appointment, Directors must retire at each AGM and may present themselves for election or re-election. None of the Non-Executive 
Directors has any provision in their letter of appointment giving them a right to compensation payable upon early termination of their appointment. 
They are not eligible for performance-related bonuses or the grant of share awards or options. No pension contributions are made on their behalf.
The annual Board fees applicable to Non-Executive Directors, including the Non-Executive Chairman, are set out in the Non-Executive 
Directors’ fees table on page 123. In addition to the mandatory shareholding requirement imposed on all Directors under the Articles described 
in the Directors section on page 208, the Board encourages each Non-Executive Director to build up, over time, a shareholding in the Company 
with a value approximately equivalent to the basic annual fee for a Non-Executive Director (£75,000) or, in the case of the Chairman, 
approximately equivalent to his annual fee (£500,000).

Transactions with Directors
There were no material recorded transactions between the Company and the Directors during 2011 or 2010.
Total shareholder return
The Regulations require the inclusion of a graph showing TSR over a five-year period in respect of a holding of the Company’s shares, plotted 
against TSR in respect of a hypothetical holding of shares of a similar kind and number by reference to which a broad equity market index is 
calculated. The Company is a member of the FTSE 100 Index and consequently, for the purposes of this graph, which is set out below, we have 
selected the FTSE 100 Index as the appropriate index. This graph is re-based to 100 at the start of the rolling five-year period. We have also 
included a ‘Pharmaceutical peers (average)’, which reflects the TSR of the same comparator group used for the PSP graphs below.
The PSP requires that the TSR in respect of a holding of the Company’s shares over the relevant performance period be compared with the 
TSR of a peer group of pharmaceutical companies (as described on page 120). The graphs below show how the Company’s TSR performance 
has compared with the TSR for the relevant companies in the comparator group from the first day in the relevant three-year performance period 
in respect of each Share Award to 31 December 2011 and how the Company ranks against those other companies on this basis.
To alleviate any short-term volatility, the return index is averaged in the TSR calculations for each company over the three months prior to the 
start of the relevant performance period (as stipulated in the PSP) and, for the purposes of the graphs below, over the last three months of 2011.

The table below shows any change in the interests of the Directors (including the interests of their Connected Persons, as such term is defined 
in the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000) in Ordinary Shares from 1 January 2011 to 31 December 2011 or on the date of resignation of 
such Director (if earlier). All such interests were beneficial except as otherwise stated. However, interests in Ordinary Shares or ADSs that are the 
subject of PSP Share Awards, AZIP Share Awards and/or the Deferred Bonus Plan discussed in this Report, are not included in the table below 
but are shown in the Performance Share Plan, AstraZeneca Investment Plan and Deferred Bonus Plan tables from page 126. No Director or 
senior executive beneficially owns, or has options over, 1% or more of the issued share capital of the Company, nor do they have different voting  
rights from other shareholders. None of the Directors has a beneficial interest in the shares of any of the Company’s subsidiaries. Between 
31 December 2011 and 2 February 2012, there was no change in the interests in Ordinary Shares shown in the table below.

  Ceased to be a Director on 28 April 2011.
Unitised stock plans
David Brennan, in common with other participating executives in the US, has interests in the following plans which were awarded to him  
prior to him becoming CEO: the AstraZeneca Executive Deferral Plan, the AstraZeneca Executive Deferred Compensation Plan and the 
AstraZeneca Savings and Security Plan. These are unitised stock plans into which the value of certain previous share incentive awards has 
been deferred (and are not incentive awards in their own right). Participants hold units in each plan, which represent a long-term equity interest 
in the Company. A unit comprises part cash and part ADSs. The overall unit value can be determined daily by taking the market value of  
the underlying ADSs and adding the cash position. The ADSs held within these units carry both voting and dividend rights. David Brennan  
is deemed to have a notional beneficial interest in these ADSs, calculated by reference to the fund value and the closing price of ADSs. 
Therefore, the number of ADSs in which a notional beneficial interest arises can vary daily as a consequence of stock price movements.

AstraZeneca Annual Report and Form 20-F Information 2011 128 Directors’ Remuneration Report In this section we describe our key risk 
management and assurance mechanisms and 
the principal risks and uncertainties which we 
consider to be material to our business as they 
may have a significant effect on our financial 
condition, results of operations and/or reputation. 
Specific risks and uncertainties are also 
discussed in the Business Review from page 29, 
where relevant.
Managing risk
As an innovation-driven, global, prescription-based biopharmaceutical 
business, we face a diverse range of risks and uncertainties that may 
adversely affect our business. Our approach to risk management is 
designed to encourage clear decision making as to which risks we 
take and how these are managed, based on an understanding of the 
potential strategic, commercial, financial, compliance, legal and 
reputational implications of these risks.
We work continuously to ensure that we have effective risk 
management processes in place to support the delivery of our 
strategic objectives, the material needs of our stakeholders and our 
core values. We monitor our business activities and external and 
internal environments for new, emerging and changing risks to ensure 
that these are managed appropriately as they arise.
The Board believes that the processes and accountabilities which are 
in place (described below) provide it with adequate information on the 
key risks and uncertainties we face. Further information about these 
risks and uncertainties is set out in the Principal risks and uncertainties 
section from page 130.
Embedded in business processes 
We strive to ensure that sound risk management is embedded within 
our strategy, planning, budgeting and performance management 
processes. The Board has defined the Group’s risk appetite expressing 
the acceptable levels of risk for the Group using three key dimensions. 
These are (i) earnings and cash flow, (ii) return on investment, and (iii) 
potential impact on our reputation. This definition provides a clear 
statement by the Board of its position on risk which enables the 
Group, in both quantitative and qualitative terms, to judge the level  
of risk it is prepared to take so as to achieve its overall objectives. 
Annually, the Group develops a long-term business plan to support 
the delivery of its strategy which the Board reviews and confirms that it 
conforms to its risk appetite. Line management are accountable for 
identifying and managing risks, and for delivering business objectives 
in accordance with the Group’s risk appetite. Each area for which a 
SET member is responsible (a SET function) is required to provide a 
comprehensive assessment of its risks as part of the annual business 
planning process. Identified risks are mapped to AstraZeneca’s risk 
‘taxonomy’, providing a structured disaggregation of the various 
potential risks facing the Group.
The CEO and the CFO undertake quarterly business reviews (QBRs) 
with each SET function, where the key risks are reviewed. Business 
managers within each SET function are required to provide quarterly 
updates on their key risks, which are then consolidated to create a list 
of key risks for that SET function to review at QBRs. The key risks for 
each SET function are then aggregated into a Group risk register.  
The purpose of the risk review is to identify and measure risks, and  
to define and review risk management and mitigation plans. Risk 
management standards, guidelines and supporting tools are in place 
to support the managers in this process. 
We develop business resilience plans to provide for situations where 
specific risks have the potential to severely impact our business. 
Global business resilience plans covering crisis management, 
business continuity and emergency responses are in place. These 
plans are supported by the provision of training and crisis simulation 
activities for business managers. 
One of our strategic priorities is to ensure that a culture of ethics  
and integrity is embedded in all our business practices. Our Code  
of Conduct (the Code) and our Global Policies and Standards set 
mandatory minimum standards of responsible behaviour for all 
employees. In addition, all employees receive annual training on  
the requirements of the Code, as well as more specific targeted 
training on particular policies and standards if required for their role. 
Employees are encouraged to raise questions on the practical 
application of these standards and to report suspected breaches  
and incidents of non-compliance through the reporting channels 
described in the Code. 
For information about how we identify and manage the risks 
associated with ‘responsible business’, see Accountabilities and 
responsibilities in the Responsible Business section on page 48. 
Key responsibilities
Management of risk 
Day-to-day risk management is delegated from the Board to the  
CEO and through the SET to line managers. SET management areas 
are accountable for establishing an appropriate line management-led 
process and for providing the resources for supporting effective  
risk management.
Line and project managers have primary responsibility, within the 
context of their functional area, for identifying and managing risk as 
well as for putting in place appropriate controls and procedures to 
monitor effectiveness.
Oversight and monitoring 
The SET is responsible for overseeing and monitoring the 
effectiveness of the risk management processes implemented by 
management. Our Global Compliance and Group Internal Audit  
(GIA) business functions support the SET by advising on policy  
and standard setting, monitoring and auditing, communication and 
training, as well as reporting on the adequacy of line management 
processes as they apply to managing our risk.
Our compliance organisation is comprised of the Global Compliance 
function together with a wide range of specialist compliance functions. 
Further information about Global Compliance and the Code can be 
found in the Global Compliance section on page 43.

Management reporting and assurance
We provide regular quarterly risk reports to the SET and to the Board. 
Among other things, these summarise our current assessment of the 
principal risks facing the Group, including environmental, social and 
governance risks, senior management accountability and our 
expected plans in order to address these risks, to the extent possible. 
The Audit Committee is comprised of five Non-Executive Directors 
and is accountable, among other things, for assessing the adequacy 
and effectiveness of the risk management systems and processes 
implemented by management. The Audit Committee receives regular 
reports from our external auditor and the following business functions:
>  GIA – independent assurance reports on the Group’s risk 
management and control framework.
>  Global Compliance – compliance programme reports on key 
compliance risks, updates on key compliance initiatives, 
performance against the Global Compliance scorecard, compliance 
incidents and investigations including calls made by employees to 
the AZethics and our biologics capabilities help-lines.
>  Financial Control and Compliance Group – reports on Sarbanes-
Oxley Act compliance and the financial control framework.
>  Management – the Group level risk summary from the annual 
business planning process and QBRs and reports on the 
performance management and monitoring processes.
The Audit Committee reviews and reports to the Board following  
each Audit Committee meeting on the overall framework of risk 
management and internal controls and is responsible for promptly 
bringing to the Board’s attention any significant concerns about the 
conduct, results or outcome of internal audits and other compliance 
matters. For further information on the Audit Committee, see the Audit 
Committee section from page 107.
GIA is an independent assurance and advisory function that reports 
to, and is accountable to, the Audit Committee. GIA’s budget, 
resources and programme of audits are approved by the Audit 
Committee annually and the findings from its audit work are reported 
to, and discussed at, each Audit Committee meeting. A core part of 
the audit work carried out by GIA includes assessing how we are 
managing risk and reviewing the effectiveness of selected aspects  
of our risk control framework, including the effectiveness of other 
assurance and compliance functions within the business. 
Principal risks and uncertainties
The pharmaceutical sector is inherently risky and a variety of risks and 
uncertainties may affect our business. Below we describe the principal 
risks and uncertainties which we consider to be material to our 
business in that they may have a significant effect on our financial 
condition, results of operations and/or reputation. 
These risks are not listed in any particular order of priority. Other risks, 
unknown or not currently considered material, could have a similar 
effect. We believe that the forward-looking statements about 
AstraZeneca in this Annual Report, identified by words such as 
‘anticipates’, ‘believes’, ‘expects’ and ‘intends’, are based on 
reasonable assumptions. However, forward-looking statements 
involve inherent risks and uncertainties such as those summarised 
below. They relate to events that may occur in the future, that may be 
influenced by factors beyond our control and that may have actual 
outcomes materially different from our expectations.
Product pipeline risks 
Failure to meet development targets Impact
The development of any pharmaceutical product candidate is a complex, risky and lengthy 
process involving significant financial, R&D and other resources, which may fail at any stage of 
the process due to a number of factors. These include: failure to obtain the required regulatory 
or marketing approvals for the product candidate or its manufacturing facilities; unfavourable 
clinical efficacy data; safety concerns; failure of R&D to develop new product candidates; and 
failure to demonstrate adequate cost effective benefits to regulators and the emergence of 
competing products.
Production and release schedules for biologics may be more significantly impacted by 
regulatory processes than other products. This is due to more complex and stringent regulation 
on the manufacturing of biologics and their supply chain.
A succession of negative drug project results and  
a failure to reduce development timelines effectively  
or produce new products that achieve commercial 
success could adversely affect the reputation  
of our R&D capabilities and is likely to materially 
adversely affect our financial condition and results 
of operations. 
Difficulties of obtaining and maintaining regulatory approvals  
for new products 
Impact
We are subject to strict controls on the commercialisation processes for our pharmaceutical 
products, including in their development, manufacture, distribution and marketing. The 
requirements to obtain regulatory approval based on a product’s safety, efficacy and quality 
before it can be marketed for an indication in a particular country, as well as to maintain and 
comply with licences and other regulations relating to its manufacture and marketing, are 
particularly important. The submission of an application to regulatory authorities (which vary, 
with different requirements, in each region or country) may or may not lead to the grant of 
marketing approval. Regulators can refuse to grant approval or may require additional data 
before approval is given, even though the medicine may already be launched in other countries. 
The approval of a product is required by the relevant regulatory authority in each country, 
although a single pan-EU MAA can be obtained through a centralised procedure.
In recent years, companies sponsoring new drug applications and regulatory authorities have 
been under increased public pressure to apply more conservative benefit/risk criteria. In some 
instances, regulatory authorities require a company to develop plans to ensure safe use of a 
marketed product before a pharmaceutical product is approved, or after approval, if a new and 
significant safety issue is established. In addition, third party interpretation of publicly available 
data on our marketed products has the potential to influence the approval status or labelling of  
a currently approved and marketed product. 
The predictability of the outcome and timing of 
review processes remains challenging, particularly  
in the US, due to competing regulatory priorities and 
a continuing sentiment of risk aversion on the part of 
regulatory reviewers and management. 
Delays in regulatory reviews and approvals could 
impact the timing of a new product launch. In 
addition, the drive for public transparency of the 
review processes through the more extensive  
use of public advisory committees increases the 
unpredictability of the process. For example, in the 
US, the approval date for Brilinta was delayed in 
December 2010 by the issuance of a Complete 
Response Letter by the FDA requesting further data 
and analysis, which led to the product ultimately 
receiving US approval in the third quarter of 2011. 
AstraZeneca Annual Report and Form 20-F Information 2011 130 Risk Product pipeline risks continued
Failure to obtain and enforce effective IP protection Impact
Our ability to obtain and enforce patents and other IP rights in relation to our products is an 
important element of our ability to protect our investment in R&D and create long-term value for 
the business. A number of the countries in which we operate are still developing their IP laws or 
may even be limiting the applicability of these laws to pharmaceutical inventions. Adverse 
political perspectives on the desirability of strong IP protection for pharmaceuticals in certain 
emerging and even developed markets may limit the scope for us to obtain effective IP 
protection for our products. As a result, certain countries may seek to limit or deny effective IP 
protection for pharmaceuticals.
Limitations on the availability of patent protection or 
the use of compulsory licensing in certain countries 
in which we operate could have a material adverse 
effect on the pricing and sales of our products and, 
consequently, could materially adversely affect our 
revenues from those products. More information 
about protecting our IP is contained in the Intellectual 
Property section from page 34. Information about 
the risk of patent litigation and the early loss of IP 
rights is contained in the Expiry or loss of, or 
limitations on, IP rights section on page 132.
Delay to new product launches Impact
Our continued success depends on the development and successful launch of innovative new 
drugs. The anticipated launch dates of major new products have a significant impact on a 
number of areas of our business, including investment in large clinical studies, the manufacture 
of pre-launch product stocks, investment in marketing materials pre-launch, sales force training 
and the timing of anticipated future revenue streams from new product sales. These launch 
dates are primarily driven by the development programmes that we run and the demands of  
the regulatory authorities in the approvals process, as well as pricing negotiations. Delays to 
anticipated launch dates can result from a number of factors including adverse findings in 
preclinical or clinical studies, regulatory demands, competitor activity and technology transfer.
Significant delays to anticipated launch dates of  
new products could have a material adverse effect 
on our financial condition and results of operations. 
For example, for the launch of products that are 
seasonal in nature, delays in regulatory approvals  
or manufacturing difficulties may delay launch to the 
next season which, in turn, may significantly reduce 
the return on costs incurred in preparing for the 
launch for that season. In addition, a delay in the 
launch may lead to increased costs if, for example, 
marketing and sales efforts need to be rescheduled 
or protracted for longer than expected.
Strategic alliances and acquisitions may be unsuccessful Impact
We seek technology licensing arrangements and strategic collaborations to expand our product 
portfolio and geographical presence as part of our business strategy.
Such licensing arrangements and strategic collaborations are key, enabling us to grow and 
strengthen the business. The success of such arrangements is largely dependent on the 
technology and other IP we acquire and the resources, efforts and skills of our partners. Also, 
under many of our strategic alliances, we make milestone payments well in advance of the 
commercialisation of the products, with no assurance that we will recoup these payments.
Furthermore, we experience strong competition from other pharmaceutical companies in 
respect of licensing arrangements and strategic collaborations, and therefore may be 
unsuccessful in establishing some of our intended projects.
We may also seek to acquire complementary businesses as part of our business strategy.  
The integration of an acquired business could involve incurring significant debt and unknown  
or contingent liabilities, as well as having a negative effect on our reported results of operations 
from acquisition related charges, amortisation of expenses related to intangibles and charges 
for the implementation of long-term assets. We may also experience difficulties in integrating 
geographically separated organisations, systems and facilities, and personnel with different 
organisational cultures.
If we fail to complete these types of collaborative 
projects in a timely manner, on a cost effective 
basis, or at all, this may limit our ability to access  
a greater portfolio of products, IP, technology and 
shared expertise. 
Additionally, disputes or difficulties in our relationship 
with our collaborators or partners may arise, often 
due to conflicting priorities or conflicts of interest 
between parties, which may erode or eliminate the 
benefits of these alliances.
The incurrence of significant debt or liabilities as a 
result of integration of an acquired business could 
cause deterioration in our credit rating and result in 
increased borrowing costs and interest expense.
Further, if, following an acquisition, liabilities are 
uncovered in the acquired business, the Group may 
suffer losses and may not have remedies against the 
seller or third parties. The integration process may 
also result in business disruption, diversion of 
management resources, the loss of key employees, 
and other issues such as a failure to integrate IT and 
other systems.

Commercialisation and business execution risks
Challenges to achieving commercial success of new products Impact
The successful launch of a new pharmaceutical product involves substantial investment in  
sales and marketing activities, launch stocks and other items. The commercial success of our 
new medicines is of particular importance to us in order to replace lost sales following patent 
expiry. We may ultimately be unable to achieve commercial success for any number of reasons.  
These include difficulties in manufacturing sufficient quantities of the product candidate for 
development or commercialisation in a timely manner, erosion of IP rights including infringement 
by third parties and failure to show a differentiated product profile.
As a result, we cannot be certain that compounds currently under development will achieve 
success, and our ability to accurately assess, prior to launch, the eventual efficacy or safety of a 
new product once in broader clinical use can only be based on data available at that time, which 
is inherently limited due to relatively short periods of product testing and small clinical study 
patient samples.
Additionally, the commercialisation of biologics is often more complex than for traditional 
pharmaceutical products, primarily due to differences in the mode of administration, technical 
aspects of the product and rapidly changing distribution and reimbursement environments.
If a new product does not succeed as anticipated  
or its rate of sales growth is slower than anticipated, 
there is a risk that we are unable to fully recoup the 
costs incurred in launching it, which could materially 
adversely affect our financial condition and results 
of operations.
 
 
Due to the complexity of the commercialisation 
process for biologics, the methods of distributing 
and marketing biologics could materially adversely 
impact our revenues from the sales of products 
such as Synagis and FluMist/Fluenz.
Illegal trade in our products Impact
Illegal trade covers the theft, illegal diversion and counterfeiting of our products. Illegal trade  
in pharmaceutical products is estimated to exceed $75 billion per year and is generally 
considered by the industry, NGOs and governmental authorities to be increasing. We suffer  
a commensurate financial exposure to illegal trade, but in many cases, due to the nature of  
our portfolio, this exposure has a greater impact on public health. Regulators and the public 
expect us to secure the integrity of our supply chain and to actively cooperate in the reduction  
of illegal trade in genuine AstraZeneca products, whether illegally diverted or stolen, and in 
counterfeited products.
Public loss of confidence in the integrity of 
pharmaceutical products as a result of counterfeiting 
could materially adversely affect our reputation and 
financial performance. In addition, undue or 
misplaced concern about the issue may induce 
some patients to stop taking their medicines, with 
consequential risks to their health. There is also a 
direct financial loss where counterfeit medicines 
replace sales of genuine products and where 
genuine products are recalled following discovery  
of counterfeit, stolen and/or illegally traded products 
in an effort to regain control of the integrity of the 
supply chain. In many countries, particularly 
developing markets, a robust programme to tackle 
illegal trade is seen as part of the licence to operate.
Developing our business in Emerging Markets Impact
The development of our business in Emerging Markets is a critical factor in determining our 
future ability to sustain or increase our global product revenues. This poses various challenges 
including: more volatile economic conditions; competition from companies with existing market 
presence; the need to identify correctly and to leverage appropriate opportunities for sales and 
marketing; poor IP protection; inadequate protection against crime (including counterfeiting, 
corruption and fraud); the need to impose developed market compliance standards; inadvertent 
breaches of local and international law; not being able to recruit appropriately skilled and 
experienced personnel; identification of the most effective sales channels and route to market; 
and interventions by national governments or regulators restricting access to market and/or 
introducing adverse price controls.
The failure to exploit potential opportunities 
appropriately in Emerging Markets may materially 
adversely affect our reputation, financial condition 
and results of operations.
Expiry or loss of, or limitations on, IP rights Impact
Pharmaceutical products are only protected from being copied during the limited period of 
protection under patent rights and/or related IP rights such as Regulatory Data Protection or 
Orphan Drug status. Expiry or loss of these rights typically leads to the immediate launch of 
generic copies of the product in the country where the rights have expired or been lost. See  
the Intellectual Property section from page 34 which contains a table of certain patent expiry 
dates for our key marketed products. 
Additionally, the expiry or loss of patents covering other innovator companies’ products may 
also lead to increased competition for our own, still-patented, products in the same product 
class due to the availability of generic products in that product class.
Products under patent protection or within the 
period of Regulatory Data Protection typically 
generate significantly higher revenues than those  
not protected by such rights. Our revenues, financial 
condition and results of operations may be materially 
adversely affected upon expiry or early loss of our  
IP rights, due to generic entrants into the market  
for the applicable product. Additionally, the loss  
of patent rights covering major products of other 
pharmaceutical companies, such as Lipitor™ 
(in November), may adversely affect the growth  
of our still-patented products in the same product 
class (ie Crestor) in that market.
AstraZeneca Annual Report and Form 20-F Information 2011 132 Risk Commercialisation and business execution risks continued
Pressures resulting from generic competition Impact
Our products compete not only with other products approved for the same condition, marketed 
by research-based pharmaceutical companies but also with generic drugs marketed by generic 
pharmaceutical manufacturers. These competitors may invest more of their resources into the 
marketing of their products than we do depending on the relative priority of these competitor 
products within their company’s portfolio. Generic versions of products are often sold at lower 
prices than branded products as the manufacturer does not have to recoup the significant cost 
of R&D investment and market development. All our patented products, including Nexium, 
Crestor and Seroquel are subject to price pressures as a result of competition from generic 
copies of these products and from generic forms of other drugs in the same product class.
As well as facing generic competition upon expiry or loss of IP rights, we also face the risk that 
generic drug manufacturers seek to market generic versions of our products prior to expiries  
of our patents and/or the Regulatory Exclusivity periods. For example, we are currently facing 
challenges in the US from numerous generic drug manufacturers regarding our patents for 
Seroquel XR, Nexium and Crestor, three of our best selling products. Generic manufacturers 
may also take advantage of the failure of certain countries to properly enforce Regulatory Data 
Protection and may launch generics during this protected period. This is a particular risk in some 
Emerging Markets where appropriate patent protection may be difficult to obtain or enforce.
If challenges to our patents by generic drug 
manufacturers succeed and generic products are 
launched, or generic products are launched ‘at risk’ 
on the expectation that challenges to our IP will be 
successful, this may materially adversely affect our 
financial condition and results of operations. In 2011, 
US sales for Seroquel XR, Nexium and Crestor 
were $779 million, $2,397 million, and $3,074 million 
respectively. Furthermore, if limitations on the 
availability, scope or enforceability of patent 
protection are implemented in jurisdictions in  
which we operate, generic manufacturers in these 
countries may be increasingly able to introduce 
competing products to the market earlier than they 
would have been able to, had more robust patent  
or Regulatory Data Protection been available.
Effects of patent litigation in respect of IP rights Impact
Any of the IP rights protecting our products may be asserted or challenged in IP litigation 
initiated against or by alleged infringers. Such IP rights may be affected by validity challenges  
in patent offices. Regardless, we expect our most valuable products to receive the greater 
number of challenges. Despite our efforts to establish and defend robust patent protection  
for our products, we may not succeed in protecting our patents from such litigation or  
other challenges.
We also bear the risk that we may be found to infringe patents owned or licensed exclusively  
by third parties, including research-based and generic pharmaceutical companies and 
individuals. Infringement accusations may implicate, for example, our manufacturing processes, 
product intermediates or use of research tools. Details of significant infringement claims against 
us by third parties enforcing IP rights can be found in Note 25 to the Financial Statements from 
page 181.
If we are not successful in maintaining exclusive 
rights to market one or more of our major products, 
particularly in the US where we achieve our highest 
revenue, our revenue and margins could be 
materially adversely affected.
Managing or litigating infringement disputes over 
so-called ‘freedom to operate’ can be costly. We 
may be subject to injunctions against our products 
or processes and be liable for damages or royalties. 
We may need to obtain costly licences. These risks 
may be greater in respect of biologics and vaccines, 
where patent infringement claims may relate to 
research tools, methods and biological materials. 
While we seek to manage such risks by, for example, 
acquiring licences, foregoing certain activities or 
uses, or modifying processes to avoid infringement 
claims and permit commercialisation of our 
products, such steps entail significant cost and 
there is no guarantee that they will be successful.
Price controls and reductions Impact
Most of our key markets have experienced the implementation of various cost control or 
reimbursement mechanisms in respect of pharmaceutical products. For example, in the US, 
realised prices are being depressed through cost-control tools such as restricted lists and 
formularies, which employ ‘generic first’ strategies and require physicians to obtain prior 
approval for the use of a branded medicine where a generic version exists. These mechanisms 
put pressure on manufacturers to reduce prices and to limit access to branded products. Many 
of these mechanisms shift a greater proportion of the cost of medicines to the individual via 
out-of-pocket payments at the pharmacy counter. The patient out-of-pocket spend is generally 
in the form of a co-payment or, in some cases, a co-insurance, which is designed, principally,  
to encourage patients to use generic medicines.
Concurrently, many markets are adopting the use of Health Technology Assessment (HTA)  
to provide a rigorous evaluation of the clinical efficacy of a product, at or post launch. HTA 
evaluations are also increasingly being used to assess the clinical as well as the cost 
effectiveness of products in a particular health system. This comes as payers and policy makers 
attempt to drive increased efficiencies in the use and choice of pharmaceutical products. 
A summary of the principal aspects of price regulation and how price pressures are affecting 
our business in our most important markets is set out in the Geographical Review from page 77 
and these economic pressures are also further discussed below in the following risk factor.
Due to these pressures on the pricing of our 
products, there can be no certainty that we will  
be able to charge prices for a product that, in a 
particular country or in the aggregate, enable us  
to earn an adequate return on our product 
investment. These pressures, including the 
increasingly restrictive reimbursement policies to 
which we are subject and the potential adoption of 
new legislation expanding the scope of permitted 
commercial importation of medicines into the US, 
could materially adversely affect our financial 
condition and results of operations.
We expect that these pressures on pricing will 
continue, and there can be no assurance that they 
will not increase.

Economic, regulatory and political pressures Impact
We face continued economic, regulatory and political pressures to limit or reduce the cost  
of our products. 
In 2010, the US passed the Affordable Care Act, a comprehensive health reform package  
with provisions taking effect between 2010 and 2014. The law expands insurance coverage, 
establishes new national entities focused on health system reforms and calls on the 
pharmaceutical industry and other healthcare industries to offset spending increases through 
‘pay-fors’. In terms of specific provisions impacting our industry, the law mandates higher 
rebates and discounts on branded drugs for certain Medicare and Medicaid patients as well  
as an industry-wide excise tax. The law also includes several health system delivery reforms  
that will be implemented over the next three years, including the establishment of a new 
comparative effectiveness research organisation, the Patient-Centered Outcomes Research 
Institute and an Independent Payment Advisory Board with broad authority to propose to  
cut Medicare expenditures. 
The health reform legislation expands the patient population eligible for Medicaid and provides 
new insurance coverage for individuals through state-operated health insurance exchanges. 
Large employers have typically offered generous health insurance benefits, but many are 
struggling with increasing health insurance premiums and may therefore opt to shift employee 
coverage into the health insurance exchanges, which will be operational by 2014. The 
pharmaceutical industry could be adversely impacted by such shifts if the health insurance 
exchanges do not offer a prescription drug benefit that is as robust as benefits historically 
provided by large employers.
In the EU, efforts by the European Commission to reduce inconsistencies and to improve 
standards in the disparate national regulatory systems have met with little immediate success. 
The industry continues to be exposed in Europe to a range of disparate pricing systems, ad hoc 
cost-containment measures and reference pricing mechanisms, which impact prices. 
Further information regarding these pressures is contained in the Regulatory requirements and 
Pricing pressure sections from page 17.
It is not possible to accurately estimate the financial 
impact of the potential consequences resulting  
from the Affordable Care Act or related legislative 
changes when taken together with the number of 
other market and industry related factors that can 
also result in similar impacts. While the overall 
reduction in our profit before tax for the year due to

wide excise fee was $750 million, this reflects only 
the limited number of known, quantifiable and 
isolatable effects of these legislative developments. 
Other potential indirect or associated consequences 
of these legislative developments, which continue to 
evolve and which cannot be estimated could have 
similar impacts. These include broader changes in 
access to, or eligibility for, coverage under Medicare, 
Medicaid or similar governmental programmes, such 
as the recent proposals to limit Medicare benefits, 
which could indirectly impact our pricing or sales  
of prescription products within the private sector.
These continued disparities in pricing systems  
could lead to marked price differentials between 
markets, which increase the pricing pressure 
affecting the industry. The importation of 
pharmaceutical products from countries where 
prices are low due to government price controls or 
other market dynamics, to countries where prices 
for those products are higher, is already prevalent 
and may increase. In particular, as discussed in the 
Pricing pressure section on page 18, Germany, 
Spain, Portugal and Greece have all introduced a 
number of short-term measures to lower healthcare 
spending, including price cuts or increased 
mandatory rebates, which could have a material 
adverse effect on our financial condition and results 
of operations.

Biosimilars Impact
Various regulatory authorities are implementing or considering abbreviated approval processes 
for biosimilars (similar versions of existing biologics, also referred to as ‘similar biological 
medicinal products’, ‘follow-on biologics’ and ‘follow-on protein products’) that would compete 
with patented biologics. 
For example, in 2010, the US enacted the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act within 
the Affordable Care Act, which contains general directives for biosimilar applications. The FDA 
sought stakeholder input on specific issues and challenges in implementing an abbreviated 
biosimilar approval pathway and further guidance is expected to be issued in the first quarter  
of 2012. In addition, the FDA and the industry have reached agreement on biosimilar user fees. 
In Europe, the EMA published a draft guideline on similar biological medicinal products 
containing MAbs. This draft guideline will likely be finalised in 2012 and is expected to include 
more clarification around the definition of biosimilars.
While it is uncertain when any such abbreviated 
approval processes may be fully adopted, 
particularly for more complex protein molecules 
such as MAbs, any such processes could materially 
adversely affect the future commercial prospects  
for patented biologics, such as the ones that 
we produce.
Increasing implementation and enforcement of more stringent anti-bribery 
and anti-corruption legislation
Impact
There is an increasing focus globally on the implementation and enforcement of anti-bribery and 
anti-corruption legislation. For example, the UK Bribery Act came into force in July. This act has 
extensive extra-territorial application, implements significant changes to existing UK anti-bribery 
legislation and broadens the scope of statutory offences and the potential applicable penalties, 
including, organisational liability for any bribe paid by persons or entities associated with an 
organisation where the organisation failed to have adequate preventative procedures in place  
at the time of the offence. There is also an increase in the maximum applicable penalties for 
bribery, including up to 10 years imprisonment and unlimited fines. There have also been 
increased enforcement efforts in the UK by the Serious Fraud Office and, in the US, there has 
been significant enforcement activity in respect of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act by the SEC 
and US Department of Justice against US companies and non-US companies listed in the US.
We are the subject of current anti-corruption investigations and there can be no assurance  
that we will not, from time to time, continue to be subject to informal inquiries and formal 
investigations from governmental agencies. In the context of our business, governmental 
officials interact with us in a variety of roles that are important to our operations, such as in the 
capacity of a regulator, partner or healthcare payer, reimburser or prescriber, among others.
We devote significant resources to the considerable 
challenge of compliance with this legislation, 
including in emerging and developing markets, at 
considerable cost. Investigations from governmental 
agencies require additional resources. Despite 
taking significant measures to prevent breaches  
of applicable anti-bribery and anti-corruption laws 
by our personnel, breaches may result in the 
imposition of significant penalties, such as fines,  
the requirement to comply with monitoring or 
self-reporting obligations or debarment or exclusion 
from government sales or reimbursement 
programmes, any of which could materially 
adversely affect our financial condition and results  
of operations and reputation.
Any expected gains from productivity initiatives are uncertain Impact
We continue to implement various productivity initiatives and restructuring programmes with the 
aim of enhancing the long-term efficiency of the business. However, anticipated cost savings 
and other benefits from these programmes are based on estimates and the actual savings may 
vary significantly. In particular, these cost reduction measures are based on current conditions 
and do not take into account any future changes to the pharmaceutical industry or our 
operations, including new business developments, wage or price increases.
If inappropriately managed, the expected value of 
these initiatives could be lost through low employee 
engagement and reduced productivity, increased 
absence and attrition levels, and industrial action.
Our failure to successfully implement these planned 
cost reduction measures, either through the 
successful conclusion of employee relations 
processes (including consultation, engagement, 
talent management, recruitment and retention), or 
the possibility that these efforts do not generate the 
level of cost savings we anticipate, could materially 
adversely affect our results of operations and 
financial condition.
Failure of information technology Impact
We are dependent on effective IT systems. These systems support key business functions such 
as our R&D, manufacturing and sales capabilities, and are an important means of internal and 
external communication.
Any significant disruption of these IT systems or 
failure to integrate new and existing IT systems could 
materially adversely affect our financial condition 
and results of operations.
Failure of outsourcing Impact
We have outsourced a number of business critical operations to third party providers.  
This includes certain R&D processes, IS/IT systems, human resources, finance and  
accounting services.
In 2011, we terminated our existing outsource relationship for IT infrastructure services and 
transitioned to a new multi-sourced operating model. This includes bringing critical strategic  
and control activities back into AstraZeneca. 
Failure of the outsource provider to deliver timely 
services and to the required level of quality could 
materially adversely affect our financial condition 
and results of operations and adversely impact our 
ability to meet business targets and maintain a good 
reputation within the industry and with stakeholders. 
It may also result in non-compliance with applicable 
laws and regulations.
A failure to successfully manage and effect the 
transfer of the provision of the IT infrastructure 
services in-house and to the new outsourcing 
providers could create disruption which could 
materially adversely affect our financial condition 
and results of operations.

Corporate Governance
Risk 135 Risk
Supply chain and delivery risks
Manufacturing biologics Impact
Manufacturing biologics, especially in large quantities, is complex and may require the use of 
innovative technologies to handle living micro-organisms and facilities specifically designed and 
validated for this purpose, with sophisticated quality assurance and control procedures. 
Slight deviations in any part of the manufacturing 
process may result in lot failure, product recalls or 
spoilage, for example due to contamination.
Reliance on third parties for goods Impact
We increasingly rely on third parties for the timely supply of goods, such as specified raw 
materials (for example, the active pharmaceutical ingredient in some of our medicines), 
equipment, formulated drugs and packaging, all of which are key to our operations.
Unexpected events and/or events beyond our control could result in the failure of the supply  
of goods. For example, suppliers of key goods we rely on may cease to trade. In addition, we 
may have limited supply of biological materials, such as cells, animal products or by-products. 
Furthermore, government regulations in multiple jurisdictions could result in restricted access  
to, use or transport of, such materials.
Third party supply failure could materially adversely 
affect our financial condition and results of 
operations. This may lead to significant delays and/
or difficulties in obtaining goods and services on 
commercially acceptable terms.
Loss of access to sufficient sources of such 
materials may interrupt or prevent our research 
activities as planned and/or increase our costs. 
Further information is contained in the Managing 
sourcing risk section on page 39.
Legal, regulatory and compliance risks
Adverse outcome of litigation and/or governmental investigations Impact
We may be subject to legal proceedings and governmental investigations. Litigation, particularly 
in the US, is inherently unpredictable and unexpectedly high awards for damages can result 
from an adverse verdict. In many cases, plaintiffs may claim compensatory, punitive and 
statutory damages in extremely high amounts. In particular, the marketing, promotional, clinical 
and pricing practices of pharmaceutical manufacturers, as well as the manner in which 
manufacturers interact with purchasers, prescribers, and patients, are subject to extensive 
regulation, litigation and governmental investigation. Many companies, including AstraZeneca, 
have been subject to claims related to these practices asserted by federal and state 
governmental authorities and private payers and consumers which have resulted in substantial 
expense and other significant consequences. Note 25 to the Financial Statements from page 
181 describes the material legal proceedings in which we are currently involved.
Investigations or legal proceedings, regardless of 
their outcome, could be costly, divert management 
attention, or damage our reputation and demand for 
our products. Unfavourable resolution of current and 
similar future proceedings against us could subject 
us to criminal liability, fines, penalties or other 
monetary or non-monetary remedies; require us to 
make significant provisions in our accounts relating 
to legal proceedings; and could materially adversely 
affect our financial condition and results of 
operations.
Substantial product liability claims Impact
Pharmaceutical companies have, historically, been subject to large product liability damages 
claims, settlements and awards for injuries allegedly caused by the use of their products. 
Adverse publicity relating to the safety of a product or of other competing products may 
increase the risk of product liability claims. 
Substantial product liability claims that result in  
court decisions against us or in the settlement of 
proceedings could materially adversely affect our 
financial condition and results of operations, 
particularly where such circumstances are not 
covered by insurance. Further details of our 
Seroquel product liability litigation are set out in 
Note 25 to the Financial Statements from page 181. 
Failure to adhere to applicable laws, rules and regulations Impact
Any failure to comply with applicable laws, rules and regulations may result in civil and/or 
criminal legal proceedings being filed against us, or in us becoming subject to regulatory 
sanctions. Regulatory authorities have wide-ranging administrative powers to deal with any 
failure to comply with continuing regulatory oversight (and this could affect us, whether such 
failure is our own or that of our third party contractors). 
This could materially adversely affect the conduct of 
our business.
For example, once a product has been approved  
for marketing by regulatory authorities, it is subject 
to continuing control and regulation, such as the 
manner of its manufacture, distribution, marketing 
and safety surveillance. In addition, any amendments 
that are made to the manufacturing, distribution, 
marketing and safety surveillance processes of  
our products may require additional regulatory 
approvals, which could result in significant additional 
costs and/or disruption to these processes. Such 
amendments may be imposed on us as a result of 
the continuing inspections to which we are subject 
or may be made at our discretion. It is possible,  
for example, that regulatory issues concerning 
compliance with current Good Manufacturing 
Practice or safety monitoring regulations for 
pharmaceutical products (often referred to as 
pharmacovigilance) could arise and lead to loss  
of product licences, product recalls and seizures, 
interruption of production leading to product 
shortages and delays in new product approvals 
pending resolution of the issues.
AstraZeneca Annual Report and Form 20-F Information 2011 136 Risk Legal, regulatory and compliance risks continued
Environmental/occupational health and safety liabilities Impact
We have environmental and/or occupational health and safety related liabilities at some currently 
or formerly owned, leased and third party sites, the most significant of which are detailed in 
Note 25 to the Financial Statements from page 181. 
While we carefully manage these liabilities, if a 
significant non-compliance issue, environmental, 
occupational health or safety incident for which  
we are responsible were to arise, this could result  
in us being liable to pay compensation, fines or 
remediation costs. In some circumstances, such 
liability could materially adversely affect our financial 
condition and results of operations. In addition, our 
financial provisions for any obligations that we may 
have relating to environmental or occupational 
health and safety liabilities may be insufficient if the 
assumptions underlying the provisions, including our 
assumptions regarding the portion of waste at a site 
for which we are responsible, prove incorrect or if 
we are held responsible for additional contamination 
or occupational health and safety related claims.
Economic and financial risks 
Adverse impact of a sustained economic downturn Impact
A variety of significant risks may arise from a sustained global economic downturn. Additional 
pressure from governments and other healthcare payers on medicine prices and volumes of 
sales in response to recessionary pressures on budgets may cause a slowdown or a decline  
in growth in some markets. In some cases, those governments most severely impacted by the 
economic downturn may seek alternative ways to settle their debts through, for example, the 
issuance of government bonds which might trade at a discount to the value of the debt. In 
addition, our customers may cease to trade, which may result in losses from writing off debts. 
We are highly dependent on being able to access a sustainable flow of liquid funds due to the 
high fixed costs of operating our business and the long and uncertain development cycles of 
our products. In a sustained economic downturn, financial institutions with whom we deal may 
cease to trade and there can be no guarantee that we will be able to access monies owed to  
us without a protracted, expensive and uncertain process, if at all. 
Our cash investments are managed centrally and more than 95% of deposits are invested 
directly in short-term, liquid US dollar funds and US Treasury Bills. Therefore, our major credit 
exposure is US sovereign default risk.
While we have adopted cash management and 
treasury policies to manage this risk (see Financial 
risk management policies section on page 93), we 
cannot be certain that these will be completely 
effective in particular in the event of a global liquidity 
crisis. In addition, open positions where we are 
owed money and deposits with financial institutions 
cannot be guaranteed to be recoverable. 
Additionally, if we need access to external sources 
of financing to sustain and/or grow our business, 
such as the debt or equity capital financial markets, 
this may not be available on commercially 
acceptable terms, if at all, in the event of a severe 
and/or sustained economic downturn. This may,  
for instance, be the case in the event of any default 
by the Group on its debt obligations, which may 
materially adversely affect our ability to secure debt 
funding in the future or generally on our financial 
condition. Further information on debt-funding 
arrangements is contained in the Financial risk 
management policies section on page 93.
Impact of fluctuations in exchange rates Impact
As a global business, currency fluctuations can significantly affect our results of operations, 
which are reported in US dollars. Approximately 40% of our global 2011 sales were in the US, 
which is expected to remain our largest single market for the foreseeable future. Sales in other 
countries are predominantly in currencies other than the US dollar, including the euro, Japanese 
yen, Australian dollar and Canadian dollar. We have a growing exposure to emerging market 
currencies, where some have exchange controls in place, but for others the exchange rates are 
also linked to the US dollar. Major components of our cost base are located in the UK and 
Sweden, where an aggregate of approximately 26.7% of our employees are based.
Movements in the exchange rates used to translate 
foreign currencies into US dollars may materially 
adversely affect our financial condition and results of 
operations. Additionally, some of our subsidiaries 
import and export goods and services in currencies 
other than their own functional currency and so the 
results of such subsidiaries could be affected by 
currency fluctuations arising between the 
transaction dates and the settlement dates for  
these transactions. See Note 23 to the Financial 
Statements from page 171.

Risk 137 Risk
Economic and financial risks continued
Limited third party insurance coverage Impact
Recent insurance loss experience in our industry, including product liability exposures, has 
increased the cost of, and narrowed the coverage afforded by, pharmaceutical companies’ 
product liability insurance. To contain insurance costs in recent years, we have continued to 
adjust our coverage profile, accepting a greater degree of uninsured exposure. The Group has 
not held product liability insurance since February 2006. In addition, where claims are made 
under insurance policies, insurers may reserve the right to deny coverage on various grounds. 
If such denial of coverage is ultimately upheld, this 
could result in material additional charges to our 
earnings. An example of a dispute with insurers 
relating to the availability of insurance coverage and 
in relation to which costs incurred by the Group may 
not ultimately be recovered through such coverage 
is included in Note 25 to the Financial Statements in 
the Seroquel product liability section on page 187.
Taxation Impact
The integrated nature of our worldwide operations can produce conflicting claims from revenue 
authorities as to the profits to be taxed in individual territories.  
 
 
 
 
The majority of the jurisdictions in which we operate have double tax treaties with other foreign 
jurisdictions, which enable us to ensure that our revenues and capital gains do not incur a 
double tax charge. 
The resolution of these disputes can result in a 
reallocation of profits between jurisdictions and an 
increase or decrease in related tax costs, and has 
the potential to affect our cash flows and EPS. 
Claims, regardless of their merits or their outcome, 
are costly, divert management attention and may 
adversely affect our reputation.
If any of these double tax treaties should be 
withdrawn or amended, especially in a territory 
where a member of the Group is involved in a 
taxation dispute with a tax authority in relation to 
cross-border transactions, such withdrawal or 
amendment could materially adversely affect our 
financial condition and results of operations, as 
could a negative outcome of a tax dispute or a 
failure by the tax authorities to agree through 
competent authority proceedings. See the Financial 
risk management policies section on page 93 for  
tax risk management policies and Note 25 to the 
Financial Statements on page 189 for details of 
current tax disputes.
Pensions Impact
Our pension obligations are backed by assets invested across the broad investment market. 
Our most significant obligations relate to the UK pension fund. 
Sustained falls in these asset values will put a strain 
on funding which may result in requirements for 
additional cash, restricting cash available for 
strategic business growth. Similarly, if the liabilities 
rise as a result of a sustained low interest rate 
environment, there will be a strain on funding from 
the business. The likely increase in the IAS 19 
accounting deficit generated by any of these factors 
may cause the ratings agencies to review our credit 
rating, with the potential to negatively affect our 
ability to raise debt. See Note 18 to the Financial 
Statements from page 165 for further details of the 
Group’s pension obligations.

The Directors assessed the effectiveness of AstraZeneca’s internal 
control over financial reporting as at 31 December 2011 based on 
the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations 
of the Treadway Commission in Internal Control-Integrated Framework. 
Based on this assessment, the Directors believe that, as at 31 December 
2011, the internal control over financial reporting is effective based on 
those criteria.
KPMG Audit Plc, an independent registered public accounting firm, has 
audited the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as 
at 31 December 2011 and, as explained on page 141, has issued an 
unqualified report thereon.
The Directors are responsible for establishing and maintaining 
adequate internal control over financial reporting. AstraZeneca’s 
internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable 
assurance over the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation 
of consolidated financial statements in accordance with generally 
accepted accounting principles.
Due to its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting 
may not prevent or detect misstatements. Projections of any evaluation 
of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risks that controls 
may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the 
degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
Directors’ Responsibilities for, and Report on, 
Internal Control over Financial Reporting
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting 
records that are sufficient to show and explain the Parent Company’s 
transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the 
financial position of the Parent Company and enable them to ensure 
that its financial statements comply with the Companies Act 2006. 
They have general responsibility for taking such steps as are reasonably 
open to them to safeguard the assets of the Group and to prevent and 
detect fraud and other irregularities.
Under applicable law and regulations, the Directors are also responsible 
for preparing a Directors’ Report, Directors’ Remuneration Report and 
Corporate Governance Statement that complies with that law and 
those regulations.
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the 
corporate and financial information included on the Company’s website. 
Legislation in the UK governing the preparation and dissemination of 
financial statements may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.
Directors’ responsibility statement pursuant to DTR 4
The Directors confirm that to the best of our knowledge:
 > The Financial Statements, prepared in accordance with the applicable 
set of accounting standards, give a true and fair view of the assets, 
liabilities, financial position and profit or loss of the Company and 
the undertakings included in the consolidation taken as a whole.
 > The Directors’ Report includes a fair review of the development 
and performance of the business and the position of the issuer and 
the undertakings included in the consolidation taken as a whole, 
together with a description of the principal risks and uncertainties 
that they face.

David R Brennan
Director
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report and 
Form 20-F Information and the Group and Parent Company Financial 
Statements in accordance with applicable law and regulations.
Company law requires the Directors to prepare Group and Parent 
Company Financial Statements for each financial year. Under that 
law they are required to prepare the Group Financial Statements in 
accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU and applicable law and 
have elected to prepare the Parent Company Financial Statements 
in accordance with UK Accounting Standards and applicable law 
(UK Generally Accepted Accounting Practice).
Under company law the Directors must not approve the financial 
statements unless they are satisfied that they give a true and fair view 
of the state of affairs of the Group and Parent Company and of their 
profit or loss for that period. In preparing each of the Group and 
Parent Company Financial Statements, the Directors are required to:
 > Select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently.
 > Make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and prudent.
 > For the Group Financial Statements, state whether they have been 
prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU.
 > For the Parent Company Financial Statements, state whether 
applicable UK Accounting Standards have been followed, subject 
to any material departures disclosed and explained in the Parent 
Company Financial Statements.
 > Prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless 
it is inappropriate to presume that the Group and the Parent 
Company will continue in business.

Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows
for the year ended 31 December Financial Statements
AstraZeneca Annual Report and Form 20-F Information 2011 146 Financial Statements
After making enquiries, the Directors have a reasonable expectation 
that the Company and the Group have adequate resources to continue 
in operational existence for the foreseeable future. Accordingly, they 
continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the Annual 
Report and Financial Statements.
Estimates and judgements
The preparation of the financial statements in conformity with generally 
accepted accounting principles requires management to make 
estimates and judgements that affect the reported amounts of assets 
and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported 
amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual 
results could differ from those estimates.
Judgements include classification of transactions between profit and 
the consolidated statement of financial position and the determination 
of operating segments while estimates focus on areas such as carrying 
values and estimated lives.
AstraZeneca’s management considers the following to be the most 
important accounting policies in the context of the Group’s operations.
The accounting policy descriptions set out the areas where judgements 
and estimates need exercising, the most significant of which are 
revenue recognition, research and development (including impairment 
reviews of associated intangible assets), business combinations and 
goodwill, litigation and environmental liabilities, employee benefits 
and taxation.
Further information on estimates and critical judgements made in 
applying accounting policies, including details of significant methods 
and assumptions used, is included in Notes 4, 6, 8, 9, 15, 18, 22 and 
25 in the Financial Statements. Financial risk management policies 
are detailed in Note 23.
Revenue
Revenues comprise sales and income under co-promotion and 
co-development agreements.
Income under co-promotion and co-development agreements is 
recognised when it is earned as defined in the contract and can be 
reliably estimated. In general this is upon the sale of the co-promoted/
developed product or upon the delivery of a promotional or 
developmental service.
Revenues exclude inter-company revenues and value-added taxes 
and represent net invoice value less estimated rebates, returns and 
settlement discounts. Revenues are recognised when the significant 
risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred to a third 
party. In general, this is upon delivery of the products to wholesalers. 
In markets where returns are significant (currently only in the US), 
estimates of returns are accounted for at the point revenue is 
recognised. In markets where returns are not significant they are 
recorded when returned.
When a product faces generic competition particular attention is given 
to the possible levels of returns and, in cases where the circumstances 
are such that the level of returns (and, hence, revenue) cannot be 
measured reliably, revenues are only recognised when the right of 
return expires, which is generally on ultimate prescription of the 
product to patients.
Basis of accounting and preparation of financial information
The Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared under the 
historical cost convention, modified to include revaluation to fair value 
of certain financial instruments as described below, in accordance 
with the Companies Act 2006 and International Financial Reporting 
Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the EU (adopted IFRSs) in response 
to the IAS regulation (EC 1606/2002). The Consolidated Financial 
Statements also comply fully with IFRSs as issued by the International 
Accounting Standards Board.
During the year the Group adopted the revised IAS 24 ‘Related Party 
Disclosures’, the amendments to IAS 32 ‘Classification of Rights Issues’, 
IFRIC 14 ‘Prepayments of a Minimum Funding Requirement’ and 
IFRIC 19 ‘Extinguishing Financial Liabilities with Equity Instruments’. 
The Group also applied the amendments contained in ‘Improvements 
to IFRSs’ issued in May 2010.
The adoption of the revisions, new interpretations and amendments 
did not have a significant effect on the Group’s profit for the period, 
net assets or cash flows.
The Company has elected to prepare the Company Financial Statements 
in accordance with UK Accounting Standards. These are presented on 
pages 193 to 197 and the accounting policies in respect of Company 
information are set out on page 194.
The Consolidated Financial Statements are presented in US dollars, 
which is the Company’s functional currency.
In preparing their individual financial statements, the accounting policies 
of some overseas subsidiaries do not conform with adopted IFRSs. 
Therefore, where appropriate, adjustments are made in order to 
present the Consolidated Financial Statements on a consistent basis.
Basis for preparation of financial statements 
on a going concern basis
Information on the business environment AstraZeneca operates 
in, including the factors underpinning the industry’s future growth 
prospects, are included in the Directors’ Report. Details of the product 
portfolio of the Group, our approach to product development and our 
development pipeline are covered in detail with additional information 
by Therapy Area in the Directors’ Report.
The financial position of the Group, its cash flows, liquidity position 
and borrowing facilities are described in the Financial Review from 
page 82. In addition, Note 23 to the Financial Statements includes the 
Group’s objectives, policies and processes for managing its capital, its 
financial risk management objectives, details of its financial instruments 
and hedging activities and its exposures to credit, market and liquidity 
risk. Further details of the Group’s cash balances and borrowings are 
included in Notes 13 and 14 of the Financial Statements.
The Group has considerable financial resources available. As at 
31 December 2011, the Group has $9.2bn in financial resources (cash 
balances of $7.6bn and committed bank facilities of $3.6bn, with only 
$2.0bn of debt due within one year). The Group’s revenues are largely 
derived from sales of products which are covered by patents and for 
which, historically at least, demand has been relatively unaffected by 
changes in the general economy. In addition, the Group has a wide 
diversity of customers and suppliers across different geographic areas. 
As a consequence, the Directors believe that the Group is well placed 
to manage its business risks successfully despite the current uncertain 
economic outlook.
Group Accounting Policies AstraZeneca Annual Report and Form 20-F Information 2011 Financial Statements 147
Financial Statements
The Group’s policy up to and including 1997 was to eliminate goodwill 
arising upon acquisitions against reserves. Under IFRS 1 ‘First-time 
Adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards’ and IFRS 3 
‘Business Combinations’, such goodwill will remain eliminated 
against reserves.
Employee benefits
The Group accounts for pensions and other employee benefits 
(principally healthcare) under IAS 19 ‘Employee Benefits’. In respect of 
defined benefit plans, obligations are measured at discounted present 
value while plan assets are measured at fair value. The operating and 
financing costs of such plans are recognised separately in profit; current 
service costs are spread systematically over the lives of employees 
and financing costs are recognised in full in the periods in which they 
arise. Actuarial gains and losses are recognised immediately in other 
comprehensive income.
Where the calculation results in a benefit to the Group, the recognised 
asset is limited to the present value of any available future refunds from 
the plan or reductions in future contributions to the plan. Payments to 
defined contribution plans are recognised in profit as they fall due.
Taxation
The current tax payable is based on taxable profit for the year. Taxable 
profit differs from reported profit because taxable profit excludes items 
that are never taxable or tax deductible. The Group’s current tax assets 
and liabilities are calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or 
substantively enacted by the reporting date.
Deferred tax is provided using the balance sheet liability method, 
providing for temporary differences between the carrying amounts of 
assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts 
used for taxation purposes. Deferred tax assets are recognised to the 
extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against 
which the asset can be utilised. This requires judgements to be made 
in respect of the availability of future taxable income.
No deferred tax asset or liability is recognised in respect of temporary 
differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, branches and 
joint ventures where the Group is able to control the timing of reversal 
of the temporary differences and it is probable that the temporary 
differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
The Group’s deferred tax assets and liabilities are calculated using tax 
rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled 
or the asset realised based on tax rates that have been enacted or 
substantively enacted by the reporting date.
Accruals for tax contingencies require management to make judgements 
and estimates of ultimate exposures in relation to tax audit issues. Tax 
benefits are not recognised unless the tax positions will probably be 
sustained. Once considered to be probable, management reviews each 
material tax benefit to assess whether a provision should be taken 
against full recognition of that benefit on the basis of potential settlement 
through negotiation and/or litigation. All provisions are included in current 
liabilities. Any recorded exposure to interest on tax liabilities is provided 
for in the tax charge. See Note 25 for further details.
Share‑ based payments
All plans are assessed and have been classified as equity settled. 
The grant date fair value of employee share option awards is generally 
calculated using the Black-Scholes model. In accordance with IFRS 2 
‘Share-based Payment’, the resulting cost is recognised in profit over 
the vesting period of the options, being the period in which the services 
are received. The value of the charge is adjusted to reflect expected 
and actual levels of awards vesting, except where the failure to vest is 
as a result of not meeting a market condition. Cancellations of equity 
instruments are treated as an acceleration of the vesting period and 
any outstanding charge is recognised in profit immediately.
For the US market we estimate the quantity and value of goods which 
may ultimately be returned at the point of sale. Our returns accruals 
are based on actual experience over the preceding 12 months for 
established products together with market-related information such as 
estimated stock levels at wholesalers and competitor activity which 
we receive via third party information services. For newly launched 
products, we use rates based on our experience with similar products 
or a pre-determined percentage.
Research and development
Research expenditure is recognised in profit in the year in which it 
is incurred.
Internal development expenditure is capitalised only if it meets the 
recognition criteria of IAS 38 ‘Intangible Assets’. Where regulatory 
and other uncertainties are such that the criteria are not met, the 
expenditure is recognised in profit and this is almost invariably the 
case prior to approval of the drug by the relevant regulatory authority. 
Where, however, recognition criteria are met, intangible assets are 
capitalised and amortised on a straight-line basis over their useful 
economic lives from product launch. At 31 December 2011, no amounts 
have met recognition criteria.
Payments to in-licence products and compounds from external third 
parties for new research and development projects (in-process research 
and development), generally taking the form of up-front payments and 
milestones, are capitalised. Where payments made to third parties 
represent future research and development activities, an evaluation is 
made as to the nature of the payments. Such payments are expensed 
if they represent compensation for subcontracted research and 
development services not resulting in a transfer of intellectual property. 
By contrast, payments are capitalised if they represent compensation 
for the transfer of intellectual property developed at the risk of the third 
party. Since acquired products and compounds will only generate 
sales and cash inflows following launch, our policy is to minimise the 
period between final approval and launch if it is within AstraZeneca’s 
control to do so. Assets capitalised are amortised, generally on a 
straight-line basis, over their useful economic lives from product launch. 
Under this policy, it is not possible to determine precise economic lives 
for individual classes of intangible assets. However, lives range from 
three years to 20 years. These assets are not used in the research and 
development activities of other products.
Intangible assets relating to products in development (both internally 
generated and externally acquired) are subject to impairment testing 
annually. All intangible assets are tested for impairment when there 
are indications that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Any 
impairment losses are recognised immediately in profit. Intangible 
assets relating to products which fail during development (or for which 
development ceases for other reasons) are tested for impairment at the 
point of termination and are written down to their recoverable amount 
(which is usually zero).
Business combinations and goodwill
On the acquisition of a business, fair values are attributed to the 
identifiable assets and liabilities and contingent liabilities unless the fair 
value cannot be measured reliably in which case the value is subsumed 
into goodwill. Where fair values of acquired contingent liabilities cannot 
be measured reliably, the assumed contingent liability is not recognised 
but is disclosed in the same manner as other contingent liabilities. 
Goodwill is the difference between the fair value of the consideration 
and the fair value of net assets acquired.
Goodwill arising on acquisitions is capitalised and subject to an 
impairment review, both annually and when there is an indication that 
the carrying value may not be recoverable. Between 1 January 1998 
and 31 December 2002, goodwill was amortised over its estimated 
useful life; such amortisation ceased on 31 December 2002. Financial Statements
AstraZeneca Annual Report and Form 20-F Information 2011 148 Financial Statements
The Group’s other financial instruments include:
 > Cash and cash equivalents
 > Fixed deposits
 > Other investments
 > Bank and other borrowings
 > Derivatives
 > Trade receivables and trade payables.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash in hand, current balances 
with banks and similar institutions and highly liquid investments with 
maturities of three months or less when acquired. They are readily 
convertible into known amounts of cash and are held at amortised cost.
Fixed deposits
Fixed deposits, comprising principally funds held with banks and other 
financial institutions, are initially measured at fair value, plus direct 
transaction costs, and are subsequently remeasured to amortised 
cost using the effective interest rate method at each reporting date. 
Changes in carrying value are recognised in profit.
Other investments
Where investments have been classified as held for trading, they are 
measured initially at fair value and subsequently remeasured to fair value 
at each reporting date. Changes in fair value are recognised in profit.
In all other circumstances, the investments are classified as ‘available 
for sale’, are initially measured at fair value (including direct transaction 
costs) and are subsequently remeasured to fair value at each reporting 
date. Changes in carrying value due to changes in exchange rates on 
monetary available for sale investments or impairments are recognised 
in profit. All other changes in fair value are recognised in other 
comprehensive income.
Impairments are recorded in profit when there is a decline in the 
value of an investment that is deemed to be other than temporary. 
On disposal of the investment, the cumulative amount recognised 
in other comprehensive income is recognised in profit as part of the 
gain or loss on disposal.
Bank and other borrowings
The Group uses derivatives, principally interest rate swaps, to hedge 
the interest rate exposure inherent in a portion of its fixed interest rate 
debt. In such cases the Group will either designate the debt as fair 
value through profit or loss when certain criteria are met or as the 
hedged item under a fair value hedge.
If the debt instrument is designated as fair value through profit or loss, 
the debt is initially measured at fair value (with direct transaction costs 
being included in profit as an expense) and is remeasured to fair value 
at each reporting date with changes in carrying value being recognised 
in profit (along with changes in the fair value of the related derivative). 
Such a designation has been made where this significantly reduces 
an accounting mismatch which would result from recognising gains 
and losses on different bases.
If the debt is designated as the hedged item under a fair value hedge, 
the debt is initially measured at fair value (with direct transaction costs 
being amortised over the life of the bonds), and is remeasured for fair 
value changes in respect of the hedged risk at each reporting date 
with changes in carrying value being recognised in profit (along with 
changes in the fair value of the related derivative).
If certain criteria are met, non-US dollar denominated loans are 
designated as net investment hedges of foreign operations. Exchange 
differences arising on retranslation of net investments, and of foreign 
currency loans which are designated in an effective net investment 
hedge relationship, are recognised in other comprehensive income. 
All other exchange differences giving rise to changes in the carrying 
value of foreign currency loans and overdrafts are recognised in profit.
Property, plant and equipment
The Group’s policy is to write off the difference between the cost of 
each item of property, plant and equipment and its residual value 
systematically over its estimated useful life. Assets under construction 
are not depreciated.
Reviews are made annually of the estimated remaining lives and 
residual values of individual productive assets, taking account of 
commercial and technological obsolescence as well as normal wear 
and tear. Under this policy it becomes impractical to calculate average 
asset lives exactly. However, the total lives range from approximately 
10 to 50 years for buildings, and three to 13 years for plant and 
equipment. All items of property, plant and equipment are tested for 
impairment when there are indications that the carrying value may 
not be recoverable. Any impairment losses are recognised immediately 
in profit.
Borrowing costs
The Group has no borrowing costs with respect to the acquisition 
or construction of qualifying assets. All other borrowing costs are 
recognised in profit as incurred and in accordance with the effective 
interest rate method.
Leases
Rentals under operating leases are charged to profit on a straight-
line basis.
Subsidiaries
A subsidiary is an entity controlled, directly or indirectly, by 
AstraZeneca PLC. Control is regarded as the power to govern the 
financial and operating policies of the entity so as to obtain benefits 
from its activities.
The financial results of subsidiaries are consolidated from the date 
control is obtained until the date that control ceases.
Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. 
The first in, first out or an average method of valuation is used. For 
finished goods and work in progress, cost includes directly attributable 
costs and certain overhead expenses (including depreciation). Selling 
expenses and certain other overhead expenses (principally central 
administration costs) are excluded. Net realisable value is determined 
as estimated selling price less all estimated costs of completion and 
costs to be incurred in selling and distribution.
Write-downs of inventory occur in the general course of business and 
are recognised in cost of sales.
Trade and other receivables
Financial assets included in trade and other receivables are recognised 
initially at fair value. Subsequent to initial recognition they are measured 
at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method, less any 
impairment losses.
Trade and other payables
Financial liabilities included in trade and other payables are recognised 
initially at fair value. Subsequent to initial recognition they are measured 
at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method.
Financial instruments
The Group’s financial instruments include interests in leases and rights 
and obligations under employee benefit plans which are dealt with in 
specific accounting policies. AstraZeneca Annual Report and Form 20-F Information 2011 Financial Statements 149
Financial Statements
Impairment
The carrying values of non-financial assets, other than inventories and 
deferred tax assets, are reviewed at least annually to determine whether 
there is any indication of impairment. For goodwill, intangible assets 
under development and for any other assets where such indication 
exists, the asset’s recoverable amount is estimated based on the 
greater of its value in use and its fair value less cost to sell. In assessing 
value in use, the estimated future cash flows, adjusted for the risks 
specific to each asset, are discounted to their present value using 
a discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time 
value of money and the general risks affecting the pharmaceutical 
industry. For the purpose of impairment testing, assets are grouped 
together into the smallest group of assets that generates cash inflows 
from continuing use that are largely independent of the cash flows of 
other assets. Impairment losses are recognised in profit.
International accounting transition
On transition to using adopted IFRSs in the year ended 31 December 
2005, the Company took advantage of several optional exemptions 
available in IFRS 1 ‘First-time Adoption of International Financial 
Reporting Standards’. The major impacts which are of continuing 
importance are detailed below:
 > Business combinations – IFRS 3 ‘Business Combinations’ has been 
applied from 1 January 2003, the date of transition, rather than being 
applied fully retrospectively. As a result, the combination of Astra 
and Zeneca is still accounted for as a merger, rather than through 
purchase accounting. If purchase accounting had been adopted, 
Zeneca would have been deemed to have acquired Astra.
 > Cumulative exchange differences – the Group chose to set the 
cumulative exchange difference reserve at 1 January 2003 to zero.
Applicable accounting standards and interpretations issued 
but not yet adopted
IFRS 9 ‘Financial Instruments’ was reissued in October 2010. It is 
applicable to financial assets and financial liabilities. For financial assets 
it requires classification and measurement in either the amortised cost 
or the fair value category. For a company’s own debt held at fair value, 
the standard requires the movement in the fair value as a result of 
changes in the company’s own credit risk to be included in other 
comprehensive income. It is effective for accounting periods beginning 
on or after 1 January 2015. The standard has not yet been endorsed 
by the EU. The adoption of IFRS 9 is not expected to have a significant 
impact upon the Group’s net results or net assets.
IFRS 10 ‘Consolidated Financial Statements’, IFRS 11 ‘Joint 
Arrangements’, IFRS 12 ‘Disclosures of Interests in Other Entities’ 
and IFRS 13 ‘Fair Value Measurement’ were issued in May 2011, 
along with consequential amendments to IAS 27 ‘Separate Financial 
Statements’ and IAS 28 ‘Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures’. 
They are all effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 
1 January 2013. The new and revised standards have yet to be 
endorsed by the EU and are not expected to have a significant impact 
upon the Group’s net results, net assets or disclosures.
The amendments to IFRS 7 ‘Disclosures – Transfer of Financial 
Assets’, IAS 12 ‘Deferred Tax: Recovery of Underlying Assets’, 
IAS 1 ‘Presentation of Items in Other Comprehensive Income’, 
IAS 19 ‘Employee Benefits’ and amendments to IAS 32 and IFRS 7 
on offsetting financial assets and liabilities are effective for accounting 
periods beginning on or after 1 July 2011, 1 January 2012, 1 July 2012, 
1 January 2013 and 1 January 2014 (IAS 32) and 1 January 2013 
(IFRS 7) respectively. They are not expected to have a significant 
impact upon the Group’s net results, net assets or disclosures. With 
the exception of IFRS 7 ‘Disclosures – Transfer of Financial Assets’, 
these amendments have yet to be endorsed by the EU.
Other interest-bearing loans are initially measured at fair value (including 
direct transaction costs) and are subsequently remeasured to amortised 
cost using the effective interest rate method at each reporting date. 
Changes in carrying value are recognised in profit.
Derivatives
Derivatives are initially measured at fair value (with direct transaction 
costs being included in profit as an expense) and are subsequently 
remeasured to fair value at each reporting date. Changes in carrying 
value are recognised in profit.
Foreign currencies
Foreign currency transactions, being transactions denominated in 
a currency other than an individual Group entity’s functional currency, 
are translated into the relevant functional currencies of individual Group 
entities at average rates for the relevant monthly accounting periods, 
which approximate to actual rates.
Monetary assets, arising from foreign currency transactions, are 
retranslated at exchange rates prevailing at the reporting date. 
Exchange gains and losses on loans and on short-term foreign 
currency borrowings and deposits are included within finance 
expense. Exchange differences on all other foreign currency 
transactions are taken to operating profit in the individual Group 
entity’s accounting records.
Non-monetary items arising from foreign currency transactions are 
not retranslated in the individual Group entity’s accounting records.
In the Consolidated Financial Statements, income and expense items 
for Group entities with a functional currency other than US dollars are 
translated into US dollars at average exchange rates, which approximate 
to actual rates, for the relevant accounting periods. Assets and liabilities 
are translated at the US exchange rates prevailing at the reporting 
date. Exchange differences arising on consolidation are taken in other 
comprehensive income.
Exchange differences arising on retranslation of net investments 
in subsidiaries and of foreign currency loans which are designated in 
an effective hedge relationship are taken in other comprehensive 
income in the Consolidated Financial Statements. Gains and losses 
accumulated in the translation reserve will be recycled to profit when 
the foreign operation is sold.
Litigation and environmental liabilities
Through the normal course of business, AstraZeneca is involved in 
legal disputes, the settlement of which may involve cost to the Group. 
Provision is made where an adverse outcome is probable and 
associated costs, including related legal costs, can be estimated 
reliably. In other cases, appropriate disclosures are included.
Where it is considered that the Group is more likely than not to prevail, 
or in the rare circumstances where the amount of the legal liability 
cannot be estimated reliably, legal costs involved in defending the 
claim are charged to profit as they are incurred.
Where it is considered that the Group has a valid contract which 
provides the right to reimbursement (from insurance or otherwise) 
of legal costs and/or all or part of any loss incurred or for which 
a provision has been established, the best estimate of the amount 
expected to be received is recognised as an asset only when it is 
virtually certain.
AstraZeneca is exposed to environmental liabilities relating to its past 
operations, principally in respect of soil and groundwater remediation 
costs. Provisions for these costs are made when there is a present 
obligation and where it is probable that expenditure on remedial work 
will be required and a reliable estimate can be made of the cost. 
Provisions are discounted where the effect is material. Financial Statements

2 Operating profit
Operating profit includes the following items:
Research and development
In 2011, research and development includes a $285m impairment charge related to the termination of development of the investigational 
compound olaparib and $150m impairment charge related to the intangible assets held in relation to TC-5214 (see Note 9). In 2010, research 
and development included a $445m impairment of intangible assets related specifically to motavizumab.
Selling, general and administrative costs
In 2011, selling, general and administrative costs includes $135m of legal provision charges in respect of the ongoing Seroquel product liability 
litigation, Average Wholesale Price litigation in the US and the Toprol-XL antitrust litigation. In 2010, selling, general and administrative costs 
included legal provision of $612m of which $592m was in respect to Seroquel legal matters. The current status of these matters is described 
in Note 25. These provisions constituted our best estimate at that time of losses expected for these matters.
Also included within selling, general and administrative costs in 2010 were gains of $791m arising from changes made to benefits under certain 
of the Group’s post-retirement benefit plans, chiefly the Group’s UK pension plan. Further details of this gain are included in Note 18.
In 2009, AstraZeneca was defending its interests in various federal and state investigations and civil litigation matters relating to drug marketing 
and pricing practices and in respect of which the Group made provisions in aggregate of $636m during 2009. $524m of this was made in 
respect of the US Attorney’s Office investigation into sales and marketing practices involving Seroquel and $112m related to average wholesale 
price litigation. 
Profit on disposal of subsidiary
The profit on disposal of subsidiary in 2011 of $1,483m relates to the sale of the Astra Tech business to DENTSPLY International Inc. Further 
details are included in Note 22.

Taxation has been provided at current rates on the profits earned for the periods covered by the Group Financial Statements. The 2011 prior 
period current tax adjustment relates to a benefit of $520m arising from a number of tax settlements (including the transfer pricing and related 
matters described in Note 25), partially offset by an increase in provisions for other tax contingencies and tax accrual to tax return adjustments. 
The 2010 prior period current tax adjustment relates mainly to an increase in provisions for tax contingencies and double tax relief partially 
offset by a benefit of $342m arising from a number of tax settlements and tax accrual to tax return adjustments. The 2009 prior period current 
tax adjustment relates mainly to tax accrual to tax return adjustments, an increase in provisions in respect of a number of transfer pricing audits 
and double tax relief. The 2011 and 2010 prior period deferred tax adjustments relate mainly to tax accrual to tax return adjustments and a 
reclassification from deferred tax to current tax of amounts provided in relation to tax contingencies for prior periods. The 2009 prior year deferred 
tax adjustment relates to tax accrual to tax return adjustments and the recognition of previously unrecognised deferred tax assets.
To the extent that dividends remitted from overseas subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates are expected to result in additional taxes, 
appropriate amounts have been provided for. No deferred tax has been provided for unremitted earnings of Group companies overseas as 
these are considered permanently employed in the business of these companies. Unremitted earnings may be liable to overseas taxes and/
or UK taxation (after allowing for double tax relief) if distributed as dividends. The aggregate amount of temporary differences associated 
with investments in subsidiaries and branches for which deferred tax liabilities have not been recognised totalled approximately $9,155m 
at 31 December 2011 (2010: $16,768m; 2009: $14,846m). AstraZeneca Annual Report and Form 20-F Information 2011 Financial Statements 153

4 Taxation continued
Factors affecting future tax charges
As a group involved in worldwide operations, AstraZeneca is subject to several factors that may affect future tax charges, principally the levels 
and mix of profitability in different jurisdictions, transfer pricing regulations, tax rates imposed and tax regime reforms. It is the UK Government’s 
intention to enact legislation which will reduce the main rate of UK corporation tax to 23% by 2014. In December 2011, the UK Government also 
released draft legislation providing details on a proposed programme of corporate tax reforms including the introduction of a patent box regime. 
Details of material tax exposures and items currently under audit and negotiation are set out in Note 25.

 The 2011 item relates to the reduction in the UK statutory corporation tax rate from 27% (the tax rate which was substantively enacted as effective from 1 April 2011 as at 31 December 2010) to the 
tax rate of 25% effective from 1 April 2012. The 2010 item relates to the reduction in the UK statutory corporation tax rate from 28% to 27% effective from 1 April 2011.
The tax rate of 19% for the year ended 31 December 2011 is lower than the UK corporation tax rate of 26.5% mainly as a result of the non-taxable 
gain on the Astra Tech disposal, the release of a tax provision following the settlement of a transfer pricing and related valuation matter (described 
in Note 25) and the difference in effective overseas tax rates as discussed below. 
AstraZeneca is domiciled in the UK but operates in other countries where the tax rates and tax laws are different to those in the UK. The impact 
of differences in effective overseas tax rates on the Group’s overall tax charge is shown above. Profits arising from our manufacturing operation 
in Puerto Rico are granted special status and are taxed at a reduced rate compared with the normal rate of tax in that territory under a tax 
incentive grant that expires in 2016.

Deferred tax assets of $169m have not been recognised in respect of deductible temporary differences (2010: $128m; 2009: $104m) because 
it is not probable that future taxable profit will be available against which the Group can utilise the benefits therefrom.

6 Segment information
AstraZeneca is engaged in a single business activity of pharmaceuticals and the Group does not have multiple operating segments. Our 
pharmaceuticals business consists of the discovery and development of new products, which are then manufactured, marketed and sold. All of 
these functional activities take place (and are managed) globally on a highly integrated basis. We do not manage these individual functional 
areas separately. 
We consider that the SET is AstraZeneca’s chief operating decision-making body (as defined by IFRS 8). The operation of the SET is principally 
driven by the management of the commercial operations, R&D, and manufacturing and supply. The SET also includes Finance, HR and Corporate 
Affairs, Compliance, IS and General Counsel representation. All significant operating decisions are taken by the SET. While members of the 
SET have responsibility for implementation of decisions in their respective areas, operating decision making is at SET level as a whole. Where 
necessary these are implemented through cross-functional sub-committees that consider the Group-wide impact of a new decision. For example, 
product launch decisions would be initially considered by the SET and, on approval, passed to an appropriate sub-team for implementation. 
The impacts of being able to develop, produce, deliver and commercialise a wide range of pharmaceutical products drive the SET decision 
making process.
In assessing performance, the SET reviews financial information on an integrated basis for the Group as a whole, substantially in the form of, and 
on the same basis as, the Group’s IFRS Financial Statements. The high upfront cost of discovering and developing new products coupled with 
the relatively insignificant and stable unit cost of production means that there is not the clear link that exists in many manufacturing businesses 
between the revenue generated on an individual product sale and the associated cost and hence margin generated on a product. Consequently, 
the profitability of individual drugs or classes of drugs is not considered a key measure of performance for the business and is not monitored 
by the SET.
Resources are allocated on a Group-wide basis according to need. In particular, capital expenditure, in-licensing, and R&D resources are 
allocated between activities on merit, based on overall therapeutic considerations and strategy under the aegis of the Group’s Portfolio 
Investment Board to facilitate a Group-wide single combined discovery and development strategy. The Group’s acquisitions in the biologics area, 
MedImmune and Cambridge Antibody Technology Group plc (CAT), have been integrated into the existing management structure of 
AstraZeneca both for allocation of resources and for assessment and monitoring of performance purposes. As such, although biologics is a 
relatively new technological area for the Group, it does not operate as a separate operating segment. AstraZeneca Annual Report and Form 20-F Information 2011 Financial Statements 155

For the purpose of impairment testing of goodwill, the Group is regarded as a single cash-generating unit.
The recoverable amount is based on value in use using discounted risk-adjusted projections of the Group’s pre-tax cash flows over 10 years. 
The projections include assumptions about product launches, competition from rival products and pricing policy as well as the possibility of 
generics entering the market. In setting these assumptions we consider our past experience, external sources of information (including information 
on expected increases and ageing of the populations in our established markets and the expanding patient population in newer markets), 
our knowledge of competitor activity and our assessment of future changes in the pharmaceutical industry. The 10 year period is covered by 
internal budgets and forecasts. Given that internal budgets and forecasts are prepared for all projections, no general growth rates are used to 
extrapolate internal budgets and forecasts for the purposes of determining value in use. No terminal value is included as these cash flows are 
more than sufficient to establish that an impairment does not exist. The methods used to determine recoverable amounts have remained 
consistent with the prior year.
In arriving at value in use, we disaggregate our projected pre-tax cash flows into groups reflecting similar risks and tax effects. For each group of 
cash flows we use an appropriate discount rate reflecting those risks and tax effects. In arriving at the appropriate discount rate for each group 
of cash flows, we adjust AstraZeneca’s post-tax weighted average cost of capital (7.0% for 2011; 7.0% for 2010; 7.6% for 2009) to reflect the 
impact of relevant industry risks, the time value of money and tax effects. The weighted average pre-tax discount rate we used was approximately 
10% (10% for 2010; 11% for 2009).
As a further check, we compare our market capitalisation to the book value of our net assets and this indicates significant surplus at 
31 December 2011 (and 31 December 2010 and 31 December 2009).
No goodwill impairment was identified.
The Group has also performed sensitivity analysis calculations on the projections used and discount rate applied. The Directors have concluded 
that, given the significant headroom that exists, and the results of the sensitivity analysis performed, there is no significant risk that reasonable 
changes in any key assumptions would cause the carrying value of goodwill to exceed its value in use. Financial Statements

Amortisation and impairment charges
The 2011 impairment of product, marketing and distribution rights includes a charge of $285m following the termination of development of the 
investigational compound olaparib for the maintenance treatment of serous ovarian cancer. The 2011 impairment charge of product, marketing 
and distribution rights also includes an impairment of $150m reflecting a lower probability of success assessment for TC-5214, based on the 
results of the first two of four Phase III efficacy and tolerability studies of the compound as an adjunct therapy to an anti-depressant in patients 
with major depressive disorder who do not respond adequately to initial anti-depressant treatment. The value of the remaining intangible assets 
held in relation to TC-5214, determined using value in use calculations as detailed below, is $50m. We are expecting results of further clinical 
trials in 2012 which will affect our assessment of the probability of success of TC-5214 which will result in either a reversal of all or part of the 
impairment recognised in 2011, or a further impairment charge. The remaining $117m charge relates to the termination of other development 
projects during the year.
The 2010 impairment of product, marketing and distribution rights results from the withdrawal of the biological license application pending at 
the FDA for motavizumab ($445m) and the termination of the lesogaberan development ($128m) and other development projects in the year. 
The 2010 impairment of other intangibles chiefly results from a reassessment of the future royalties expected to be received relating to the 
HPV cervical cancer vaccine.
The 2009 impairment of product, marketing and distribution rights results from the termination of development projects during the year. The 
2009 impairment of other intangibles results from a reassessment of the future royalties expected to be received relating to the HPV cervical 
cancer vaccine and a reassessment of other future licensing and contractual income expected to be earned within our biologics business. 
The write downs in value of intangible assets, other than those arising from termination of research and development activities, were determined 
based on value in use calculations using discounted risk-adjusted projections of the products’ expected cash flows over a period reflecting 
the patent-protected lives of the individual products. The full period of projections is covered by internal budgets and forecasts. In arriving at 
the appropriate discount rate to use for each product, we adjust AstraZeneca’s post-tax weighted average cost of capital (7.0% for 2011; 7.0% 
for 2010; 7.6% for 2009) to reflect the impact of risks and tax effects specific to the individual products. The weighted average pre-tax discount 
rate we used was approximately 14% (2010: 14%; 2009: 14%).

 Includes borrowings designated as hedges of net investments in foreign operations of $1,505m (2010: $1,528m; 2009: $1,630m) held at amortised cost. The fair value of these borrowings was 
$1,752m at 31 December 2011 (2010: $1,687m; 2009: $1,747m).
Other financial assets represent trade and other receivables (Note 12) excluding prepayments and accrued income. Other financial liabilities 
represent trade and other payables (Note 16) excluding deferred income.
A gain of $4m was made during the year on the fair value of bonds designated at fair value through profit and loss, due to increased credit risk. 
A gain of $44m has been made on these bonds since designation due to increased credit risk. Changes in credit risk had no material effect on 
any other financial assets and liabilities recognised at fair value in the Group’s Financial Statements. The change in fair value attributable to changes 
in credit risk is calculated as the change in fair value not attributable to market risk. The amount payable at maturity on bonds designated at fair 
value through profit or loss is $1,037m.
The methods and assumptions used to estimate the fair values of financial instruments together with their carrying values are as follows:
 > Cash and overdrafts – held on the consolidated statement of financial position at amortised costs. Fair value approximates to carrying value.
 > Loans due within one year and after more than one year – the fair value of fixed-rate publicly traded debt is based on year end quoted market 
prices; the fair value of floating rate debt is nominal value, as mark to market differences would be minimal given the frequency of resets. 
The carrying value of loans designated at fair value through profit or loss is the fair value. For loans designated in a fair value hedge relationship, 
carrying value is initially measured at fair value and remeasured for fair value changes in respect of the hedged risk at each reporting date. 
All other loans are held at amortised cost.
 > Derivative financial instruments – consists of interest rate swaps (included in instruments designated at fair value if related to debt designated 
at fair value or instruments in a fair value hedge relationship if formally designated as in a fair value hedge relationship) and forward foreign 
exchange contracts (included in other financial instruments at fair value). All derivatives are held at fair value.
 – Interest rate swaps – the fair value is estimated using appropriate zero coupon curve valuation techniques to discount future contractual 
cash flows based on rates current at year end.
 – Forward foreign exchange contracts – the majority of contracts for existing transactions had maturities of less than one month from year end. 
The fair value of forward foreign exchange contracts is estimated by discounting the future contractual cash flows using appropriate yield 
curves based on market forward foreign exchange rates at the year end.
 > Other investments – held on the consolidated statement of financial position at fair value. These include equity securities held on the 
consolidated statement of financial position as other investments (Note 10). The fair value of listed investments is based on year end quoted 
market prices. Unlisted investments are held at cost which approximates to fair value. 
 > Other financial assets and other financial liabilities – with the exception of contingent consideration which is held at fair value (see Note 22), 
other financial assets and liabilities are held on the consolidated statement of financial position at amortised costs with carrying value being 
a reasonable approximation of fair value. AstraZeneca Annual Report and Form 20-F Information 2011 Financial Statements 163

Equity securities available for sale which are analysed at Level 3 represent investments in private biotech companies. In the absence of specific 
market data, these unlisted investments are held at cost, adjusted as necessary for impairments, which approximates to fair value. Hence, carrying 
value is adjusted only for additions, sales and permanent impairment and for no other movement. Consequently, in the current year, no change 
has been made to the fair value of individual investments. Level 3 other financial assets and liabilities arose on the acquisition of Novexel and the 
subsequent transaction with Forest as detailed in Note 22. The table above does not include bonds designated in a fair value hedge relationship. 
The carrying value of these bonds is initially measured at fair value and remeasured only for fair value changes in respect of the hedged risk. 
Therefore, the bonds are not carried at full fair value at 31 December 2011 and have not been classified within the hierarchy.

18 Post-retirement benefits
Pensions
Background
The Company and most of its subsidiaries offer retirement plans which cover the majority of employees in the Group. Many of these plans are 
‘defined contribution’, where AstraZeneca’s contribution and resulting charge is fixed at a set level or is a set percentage of employees’ pay. 
However, several plans, mainly in the UK, the US and Sweden, are ‘defined benefit’, where benefits are based on employees’ length of service 
and average final salary (typically averaged over one, three or five years). The major defined benefit plans, apart from the collectively bargained 
Swedish plan (which is still open to employees born before 1979), have been closed to new entrants since 2000.
The major defined benefit plans are funded through legally separate, fiduciary-administered funds. The cash funding of the plans, which 
may from time to time involve special payments, is designed, in consultation with independent qualified actuaries, to ensure that the assets 
together with future contributions should be sufficient to meet future obligations. The funding is monitored rigorously by AstraZeneca and 
appropriate fiduciaries specifically with reference to AstraZeneca’s credit rating, market capitalisation, cash flows and the solvency of the 
relevant pension scheme.
Financing Principles
96.7% of the Group’s defined benefit obligations at 31 December 2011 are in schemes within the UK, the US, Sweden or Germany. In these 
countries the pension obligations are funded with reference to the following financing principles:
 > The Group has a fundamental belief in funding the benefits it promises to employees.
 > The Group considers its pension arrangements in the context of its broader capital structure. In general it does not believe in committing 
excessive capital for funding while it has better uses of capital within the business nor does it wish to generate surpluses.
 > The pension funds are not part of the Group’s core business. The Group believes in taking some rewarded risks with the investments 
underlying the funding, subject to a medium to long-term plan to reduce those risks if opportunities arise.
 > The Group recognises that deciding to hold certain investments may cause volatility in the funding position. The Group would not wish 
to amend its contribution level for relatively small deviations from its preferred funding level, because it is expected that there will be 
short-term volatility, but it is prepared to react appropriately to more significant deviations. 
 > In the event that local regulations require an additional level of financing, the Group would consider the use of alternative methods of providing 
this that do not require immediate cash funding but help mitigate exposure of the pension arrangement to the credit risk of the Group.
These principles are appropriate to AstraZeneca’s business at the present date; should circumstances change they may require review.
AstraZeneca has developed a funding framework to implement these principles. This determines the cash contributions payable to the pension 
funds, but does not affect the IAS 19 liabilities. To reduce the risk of committing excess capital to pension funds, liability valuations are based 
on the expected return on the actual pension assets, rather than a corporate bond yield. At present this puts a different value on the liabilities 
than IAS 19.
UK
With regard to the Group’s UK defined benefit fund, the above principles are modified in light of the UK regulatory requirements and resulting 
discussions with the Pension Fund Trustee. The most recent full actuarial valuation was carried out at 31 March 2010.
Under the agreed funding principles for the UK, cash contributions will be paid to the UK Pension Fund to target a level of assets in excess of 
the current expected cost of providing benefits. In addition, AstraZeneca will make contributions to an escrow account which will be held outside 
of the UK Pension Fund. The escrow account assets will be payable to the fund in agreed circumstances, for example, in the event of AstraZeneca 
and the Pension Fund Trustee agreeing on a change to the current long-term investment strategy.
The market value of the fund’s assets at the valuation date was £3,129m ($4,832m equivalent), representing 79% of the fund’s actuarially 
assessed liabilities (Technical Provisions). The Company has agreed to fund the shortfall by making payments of £72.5m ($112m) a year until 
31 December 2011 and then lump sum payments totalling £715m ($1,103m) before 30 June 2013. The first of these lump sum payments of 
£180m ($278m) was paid into the UK Pension Fund in December 2011 from existing investments held in escrow for the Pension Fund. A further 
£300m ($463m) was paid into the UK Pension Fund during January 2012 with the balance payable by 30 June 2013. This is in addition to the 
contributions required to meet the ongoing benefits accruing in the region of £24m ($37m) per annum. In 2011, £132m ($213m) was paid into 
the escrow account and a further £230m ($355m) was paid in during January 2012. At 31 December 2011, £192m ($296m) of escrow fund 
assets are included within other investments (see Note 10).
Under the agreed funding principles used to set the Technical Provisions, the key assumptions as at 31 March 2010 are as follows: long-term 
UK price inflation set at 3.8% per annum, salary increases at 0% per annum (as a result of pensionable pay levels being frozen in 2010), pension 
increases at 3.55% per annum and investment returns at 5.9% per annum.
During the first half of 2010, following consultation with its UK employees’ representatives, AstraZeneca introduced a freeze on pensionable 
pay at 30 June 2010 levels for defined benefit members of the UK Pension Fund. The defined benefit fund remains open to existing members 
and employees who choose to leave the defined benefit fund will retain a deferred pension in addition to being offered membership in a new 
Group Self Invested Personal Pension Plan.
The amendment to the UK defined benefit fund to freeze pensionable pay at 30 June 2010 levels represents an accounting curtailment of certain 
pension obligations. The majority of members opted to remain in the defined benefit fund and continue benefit accrual with frozen pensionable 
pay. In accordance with IAS 19, the scheme obligations were revalued by the scheme actuaries immediately prior to the change and assumptions 
reviewed at that date. The resulting credit of $693m was recognised in comprehensive income in 2010. Financial Statements

Rest of Group
The IAS 19 positions as at 31 December 2011 are shown below for each of the other countries with significant defined benefit plans. These plans 
account for 91% of the Group’s defined benefit obligations outside of the UK. These plans are funded in line with the financing principles and 
contributions paid as prescribed by the funding framework.
 > The US defined benefits programme was actuarially revalued at 31 December 2011, when plan obligations were $1,987m and plan assets 
were $1,593m. This includes obligations in respect of the non-qualified plan which is largely unfunded.
 > The Swedish defined benefits programme was actuarially revalued at 31 December 2011, when plan obligations were estimated to amount 
to $1,545m and plan assets were $902m.
 > The German defined benefits programme was actuarially revalued at 31 December 2011, when plan obligations amounted to $258m and 
plan assets were $23m. 
On current bases, it is expected that contributions (excluding those in respect of past service cost) during the year ended 31 December 2012 
to the four main countries will be $664m.
Post-retirement benefits other than pensions
In the US, and to a lesser extent in certain other countries, AstraZeneca’s employment practices include the provision of healthcare and life 
assurance benefits for retired employees. As at 31 December 2011, some 3,431 retired employees and covered dependants currently benefit 
from these provisions and some 10,694 current employees will be eligible on their retirement. AstraZeneca accrues for the present value of 
such retiree obligations over the working life of the employee. In practice these benefits will be funded with reference to the financing principles.
The cost of post-retirement benefits other than pensions for the Group in 2011 was $12m (2010: $18m; 2009: $19m). Plan assets were $290m 
and plan obligations were $330m at 31 December 2011. These benefit plans have been included in the disclosure of post-retirement benefits 
under IAS 19.
Financial assumptions
Qualified independent actuaries have updated the actuarial valuations under IAS 19 of the major defined benefit schemes operated by the Group 
to 31 December 2011. The assumptions used by the actuaries are chosen from a range of possible actuarial assumptions which, due to the 
long-term nature of the schemes, may not necessarily be borne out in practice. These assumptions were as follows:

 Pensionable pay frozen at 30 June 2010 levels following UK fund changes.
The expected return on assets is determined with reference to the expected long-term level of dividends, interest and other returns derived from 
the plan assets, together with realised and unrealised gains or losses on the plan assets, less any costs of administering the plan, less any tax 
payable by the plan. The expected returns are based on long-term market expectations and analysed on a regular basis to ensure that any 
sustained movements in underlying markets are reflected.
Demographic assumptions
The mortality assumptions are based on country-specific mortality tables. These are compared to actual AstraZeneca experience and adjusted 
where sufficient data is available. Additional allowance for future improvements in life expectancy is included for all major schemes where there 
is credible data to support this continuing trend.
The table below illustrates life expectancy assumptions at age 65 for male members retiring in 2011 and members expected to retire in 2031 
(2010: 2010 and 2030 respectively).

Post-retirement scheme deficit
The assets and obligations of the defined benefit schemes operated by the Group at 31 December 2011, as calculated in accordance with  
IAS 19 ‘Employee Benefits’, are shown below. The fair values of the schemes’ assets are not intended to be realised in the short term and may 
be subject to significant change before they are realised. The present value of the schemes’ obligations is derived from cash flow projections 
over long periods and is therefore inherently uncertain.

The cumulative amount of goodwill written off directly to reserves resulting from acquisitions, net of disposals, amounted to $680m (2010: $682m; 
2009: $667m) using year end rates of exchange. At 31 December 2011, 36,177 shares, at a cost of $2m, have been deducted from retained 
earnings (2010: 57,717 shares, at a cost of $3m; 2009: 24,178 shares, at a cost of $1m).
There are no significant statutory or contractual restrictions on the distribution of current profits of subsidiaries, joint ventures or associates; 
undistributed profits of prior years are, in the main, permanently employed in the businesses of these companies. The undistributed income 
of AstraZeneca companies overseas might be liable to overseas taxes and/or UK taxation (after allowing for double taxation relief) if they were 
to be distributed as dividends (see Note 4).

2010 acquisitions
Novexel
On 3 March 2010, AstraZeneca completed the acquisition of Novexel. Novexel is a research company focused on the infection therapy area 
and is based in France. This acquisition strengthens our research capabilities in the infection therapy area. AstraZeneca acquired 100% of 
Novexel’s shares for an upfront consideration of $427m; with additional consideration of up to $75m becoming payable to Novexel shareholders 
on the completion of certain development milestones. At both the date of acquisition and at 31 December 2010, the fair value of this contingent 
consideration was $50m. For the ten-month period post-acquisition to the end of 2010 and the full year, Novexel had no revenues and its loss 
was immaterial.

Subsequent to the completion of the acquisition of Novexel, AstraZeneca entered into a collaboration with Forest on the future co-development 
and commercialisation of two late-stage antibiotic development programmes acquired with Novexel: ceftazidime/NXL -104 (CAZ-104) and 
ceftaroline/NXL -104 (CEF-104). These antibiotic combinations utilise Novexel’s novel investigational beta-lactamase inhibitor NXL -104 to overcome 
antibiotic resistance and treat the increasing number of infections resistant to existing therapies. In addition, Forest acquired rights to CAZ-104 
in North America and bought down payment obligations to Novexel in relation to CEF-104 from previous existing licence arrangements. In 
consideration for these rights, Forest paid Novexel, then an AstraZeneca group company, a sum of $210m on 3 March 2010 and will also pay 
additional sums equivalent to half of any future specified development milestone payments that become payable by AstraZeneca. This consideration 
is equivalent to the fair value attributed on acquisition to those assets and hence there is no profit impact from this divestment.

23 Financial risk management objectives and policies
The Group’s principal financial instruments, other than derivatives, comprise bank overdrafts, loans, current and non-current investments, cash 
and short-term deposits. The main purpose of these financial instruments is to manage the Group’s funding and liquidity requirements. The Group 
has other financial assets and liabilities such as trade receivables and trade payables, which arise directly from its operations. 
The principal financial risks to which the Group is exposed are those of liquidity, interest rate, foreign currency and credit. Each of these is 
managed in accordance with Board-approved policies. These policies are set out below.
The Group uses foreign currency borrowings, foreign currency forwards and options, interest rate swaps and forward rate agreements for the 
purpose of hedging its foreign currency and interest rate risks. The Group may designate certain financial instruments as either fair value hedges 
or net investment hedges in accordance with IAS 39. Key controls applied to transactions in derivative financial instruments are: to use only 
instruments where good market liquidity exists, to revalue all financial instruments regularly using current market rates and to sell options only 
to offset previously purchased options. The Group does not use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes.
Capital management
The capital structure of the Group consists of shareholders’ equity (Note 20), debt (Note 14) and cash (Note 13). For the foreseeable future, 
the Board will maintain a capital structure that supports the Group’s strategic objectives through:
 > managing funding and liquidity risk

23 Financial risk management objectives and policies continued 
The Board’s distribution policy comprises both a regular cash dividend, and subject to business needs, a share repurchase component. The Board 
regularly reviews its shareholders’ return strategy, and in 2010 adopted a progressive dividend policy, whereby the Board intends to maintain 
or grow the dividend each year, targeting an average dividend cover of two times (ie a payout ratio of 50%), based on reported earnings (before 
restructuring costs and profit on disposal of Astra Tech). In addition, after providing for business investment, funding the progressive dividend 
policy and meeting debt service obligations, the Board will regularly assess the opportunity to return cash in excess of these requirements to 
shareholders through share repurchases.
The Group’s net funds position (loans and borrowings net of cash and cash equivalents, current investments and derivative financial instruments) 
has decreased from $3,653m at the beginning of the year to a net funds position of $2,849m at 31 December 2011 as a result of our substantial 
share repurchases in 2011, tax and pension payments made, offset by strong net operating cash inflows and cash received on the disposal of 
Astra Tech.
Liquidity risk
The Board reviews the Group’s ongoing liquidity risks annually as part of the planning process and on an ad hoc basis. The Board considers short-term 
requirements against available sources of funding taking into account forecast cash flows. The Group manages liquidity risk by maintaining access 
to a number of sources of funding which are sufficient to meet anticipated funding requirements. Specifically, the Group uses US commercial 
paper, committed bank facilities and cash resources to manage short-term liquidity and manages long-term liquidity by raising funds through 
the capital markets. The Group’s current long-term credit rating is A1 by Moody’s and AA- by Standard and Poor’s, both with a stable outlook.
In addition to cash and cash equivalents of $7,571m, fixed deposits of $3,927m less overdrafts of $137m at 31 December 2011, the Group has 
committed bank facilities of $3.6bn available to manage liquidity. At 31 December 2011, the Group has issued $1,505m under a Euro Medium 
Term Note programme and $7 ,602m under a SEC-registered programme. The Group regularly monitors the credit standing of the banking group 
and currently does not anticipate any issue with drawing on the committed facilities should this be necessary. The committed facilities of $3.6bn 
mature in October 2012 and were undrawn at 31 December 2011.
The maturity profile of the anticipated future contractual cash flows including interest in relation to the Group’s financial liabilities, on an 
undiscounted basis and which, therefore, differs from both the carrying value and fair value, is as follows:

Where interest payments are on a floating rate basis, it is assumed that rates will remain unchanged from the last business day of each year 
ended 31 December.
It is not expected that the cash flows in the maturity profile could occur significantly earlier or at significantly different amounts.
Market risk
Interest rate risk
The Group maintains a mix of fixed and floating rate debt. The portion of fixed rate debt was approved by the Board and any variation requires 
Board approval. A significant portion of the long-term debt entered into in 2007 in order to finance the acquisition of MedImmune has been held 
at fixed rates of interest. The Group uses interest rate swaps and forward rate agreements to manage this mix.
At 31 December 2011, the Group held interest rate swaps with a notional value of $2.5bn, converting the 5.4% callable bond maturing in 2014, 
and the 7% guaranteed debentures payable in 2023 to floating rates and partially converting the 5.4% callable bond maturing in 2012 and the 
5.9% callable bond maturing in 2017 to floating rates. No new interest rate swaps were entered into during 2011 or 2010. At 31 December 2011 
swaps with a notional value of $1.5bn were designated as fair value hedges and swaps with a notional value of $1.0bn related to debt designated 
as fair value through profit or loss. Designated hedges are expected to be effective and therefore the impact of ineffectiveness on profit is not 
expected to be material. The accounting treatment for fair value hedges and debt designated as fair value through profit or loss is disclosed in 
the Group Accounting Policies section from page 146.
The majority of surplus cash is currently invested in US Treasury liquidity funds and direct purchases of US Treasury bills earning floating rates 
of interest. A portion of US Treasury bills have a maturity of greater than 3 months at inception for improved yield.
The interest rate profile of the Group’s interest-bearing financial instruments, as at 31 December 2011, 31 December 2010 and 31 December 
2009 is set out below. In the case of current and non-current financial liabilities, the classification includes the impact of interest rate swaps 
which convert the debt to floating rate.

and other financial assets on which no interest is received. 
Foreign currency risk
The US dollar is the Group’s most significant currency. As a consequence, the Group results are presented in US dollars and exposures are 
managed against US dollars accordingly.
Translational
Approximately 60% of Group external sales in 2011 were denominated in currencies other than the US dollar, while a significant proportion of 
manufacturing and research and development costs were denominated in pounds sterling and Swedish krona. Surplus cash generated by 
business units is substantially converted to, and held centrally in, US dollars. As a result, operating profit and total cash flow in US dollars will 
be affected by movements in exchange rates.
This currency exposure is managed centrally based on forecast cash flows including the principal currencies of Swedish krona (SEK), pounds 
sterling (GBP), euro (EUR), Australian dollar (AUD), Canadian dollar (CAD), Japanese yen (JPY), Romanian leu (RON) and Russian ruble (RUB). 
The impact of movements in exchange rates is mitigated significantly by the correlations which exist between the major currencies to which the 
Group is exposed and the US dollar. Monitoring of currency exposures and correlations is undertaken on a regular basis and hedging is subject 
to pre-execution approval. 
Where there is non-US dollar debt and an underlying net investment of that amount in the same currency, the Group applies net investment 
hedging. As at 31 December 2011, 5.7% of interest-bearing loans and borrowings were denominated in pounds sterling and 10.4% of interest-
bearing loans and borrowings were denominated in euros. Exchange differences on the retranslation of debt designated as net investment 
hedges are recognised in other comprehensive income to the extent that the hedge is effective. Any ineffectiveness is taken to profit. Exchange 
differences on foreign currency borrowings not designated in a hedge relationship are taken to profit.
Transactional
One hundred percent of the Group’s major transactional currency exposures on working capital balances, which typically extend for up to three 
months, are hedged, where practicable, using forward foreign exchange contracts against individual Group companies’ reporting currency. In 
addition, the Group’s external dividend, which is paid principally in pounds sterling and Swedish krona, is fully hedged from announcement to 
payment date. Foreign exchange gains and losses on forward contracts transacted for transactional hedging are taken to profit. Financial Statements

Sensitivity analysis 
The sensitivity analysis set out below summarises the sensitivity of the market value of our financial instruments to hypothetical changes in market 
rates and prices. The range of variables chosen for the sensitivity analysis reflects our view of changes which are reasonably possible over a 
one-year period. Market values are the present value of future cash flows based on market rates and prices at the valuation date. For long-term 
debt, an increase in interest rates results in a decline in the fair value of debt.
The sensitivity analysis assumes an instantaneous 100 basis point change in interest rates in all currencies from their levels at 31 December 2011, 
with all other variables held constant. Based on the composition of our long-term debt portfolio as at 31 December 2011, a 1% increase in 
interest rates would result in an additional $31m in interest expense being incurred per year. The exchange rate sensitivity analysis assumes 
an instantaneous 10% change in foreign currency exchange rates from their levels at 31 December 2011, with all other variables held constant. 
The +10% case assumes a 10% strengthening of the US dollar against all other currencies and the -10% case assumes a 10% weakening of 
the US dollar.
Each incremental 10% movement in foreign currency exchange rates would have approximately the same effect as the initial 10% detailed in  
the table below and each 1% change in interest rates would have approximately the same effect as the 1% detailed in the table below.

There has been no change in the methods and assumptions used in preparing the above sensitivity analysis over the three-year period.
Credit risk
The Group is exposed to credit risk on financial assets, such as cash balances (including fixed deposits and cash and cash equivalents), 
derivative instruments, trade and other receivables. The Group is also exposed in its net asset position to its own credit risk in respect of 
the 2023 debentures and 2014 bonds which are accounted for at fair value through profit and loss. AstraZeneca Annual Report and Form 20-F Information 2011 Financial Statements 175
Financial Statements
23 Financial risk management objectives and policies continued
Trade and other receivables
Trade receivable exposures are managed locally in the operating units where they arise and credit limits are set as deemed appropriate for the 
customer. The Group is exposed to customers ranging from government-backed agencies and large private wholesalers to privately owned 
pharmacies, and the underlying local economic and sovereign risks vary throughout the world. Where appropriate, the Group endeavours to 
minimise risks by the use of trade finance instruments such as letters of credit and insurance. The Group establishes an allowance for impairment 
that represents its estimate of incurred losses in respect of specific trade and other receivables where it is deemed that a receivable may not be 
recoverable. When the debt is deemed irrecoverable, the allowance account is written off against the underlying receivable. 
In the US, sales to three wholesalers accounted for approximately 75% of US sales (2010: three wholesalers accounted for approximately 73%; 
2009: three wholesalers accounted for approximately 81%).

The allowance for impairment has been calculated based on past experience and is in relation to specific customers. Given the profile of our 
customers, including large wholesalers and government-backed agencies, no further credit risk has been identified with the trade receivables 
not past due other than those balances for which an allowance has been made.
Other financial assets
The Group may hold significant cash balances as part of its normal operations, with the amount of cash held at any point reflecting the level of 
cash flow generated by the business and the timing of the use of that cash. The majority of excess cash is centralised within the Group treasury 
entity and is subject to counterparty risk on the principal invested. This risk is mitigated through a policy of prioritising security and liquidity over 
return, and as such cash is only invested in high credit quality investments. Counterparty limits are set according to the assessed risk of each 
counterparty and exposures are monitored against these limits on a regular basis. The majority of the Group’s cash is invested in AAA-rated 
treasury liquidity funds, US Treasury bills and short-term bank deposits.
The most significant concentration of financial credit risk at 31 December 2011 was $5,844m invested in three US AAA-rated Treasury funds and 
$4,015m invested in US Treasury bills. The liquidity fund portfolios are managed by the related external third party fund managers to maintain the 
AAA rating. No more than 15% of fund value is invested within each individual fund. US Treasury bills bear credit exposure to the US government. 
There were no other significant concentrations of financial credit risk at the reporting date.
All financial derivatives are transacted with commercial banks, in line with standard market practice. The Group has agreements with some bank 
counterparties whereby the parties agree to post cash collateral, for the benefit of the other, equivalent to the market valuation of the derivative 
positions above a predetermined threshold. The carrying value of such cash collateral held by the Group at 31 December 2011 was $21m. Financial Statements

Severance costs of $431m are not included above (2010: $531m; 2009: $285m).
The Directors believe that, together with the basic salary system, the Group’s employee incentive schemes provide competitive and market-
related packages to motivate employees. They should also align the interests of employees with those of shareholders, as a whole, through 
long-term share ownership in the Company. The Group’s current UK, Swedish and US schemes are described below; other arrangements 
apply elsewhere.
Bonus plans
The AstraZeneca UK Performance Bonus Plan
Employees of participating AstraZeneca UK companies are invited to participate in this bonus plan, which rewards strong individual performance. 
Bonuses in respect of performance during 2011 will be paid in cash, as they were in 2010. Bonuses in respect of 2009 and earlier years were 
paid partly in the form of Ordinary Shares in the Company (under the HM Revenue & Customs (HMRC)-approved AstraZeneca All-Employee 
Share Plan and up to a maximum annual value of £3,000) and partly in cash. A tax-efficient share retention scheme, under which employees 
leave their bonus shares in trust, forms part of the All-Employee Share Plan. The Company also offers UK employees the opportunity to buy 
Partnership Shares (Ordinary Shares) under the All-Employee Share Plan. Employees may invest up to £1,500 over a 12-month accumulation 
period and purchase Partnership Shares in the Company with the total proceeds at the end of the period. The purchase price for the shares is 
the lower of the price at the beginning or the end of the 12-month period. A tax-efficient share retention scheme is also available in respect of 
Partnership Shares. In 2010, the Company introduced a Matching Share element in respect of Partnership Shares, the first award of which was 
made in 2011. At the Company’s AGM in 2002, shareholders approved the issue of new shares for the purposes of the All-Employee Share Plan.
The AstraZeneca Executive Annual Bonus Scheme
This scheme is a performance bonus scheme for Directors and senior employees who do not participate in the AstraZeneca UK Performance 
Bonus Plan. Annual bonuses are paid in cash and reflect both corporate and individual performance measures. The Remuneration Committee 
has discretion to reduce or withhold bonuses if business performance falls sufficiently short of expectations in any year such as to make the 
payment of bonuses inappropriate.
The AstraZeneca Deferred Bonus Plan
This plan was introduced in 2006 and is used to defer a portion of the bonus earned under the AstraZeneca Executive Annual Bonus Scheme 
into Ordinary Shares in the Company for a period of three years. The plan currently operates only in respect of Executive Directors and members 
of the SET. Awards of shares under this plan are typically made in February each year, the first award having been made in February 2006.
Sweden
In Sweden an all-employee performance bonus plan is in operation, which rewards strong individual performance. Bonuses are paid 50% into 
a fund investing in AstraZeneca equities and 50% in cash. The AstraZeneca Executive Annual Bonus Scheme, the AstraZeneca Performance 
Share Plan and the AstraZeneca Global Restricted Stock Plan all operate in respect of relevant AstraZeneca employees in Sweden. AstraZeneca Annual Report and Form 20-F Information 2011 Financial Statements 177

US
In the US, there are two all-employee short-term or annual performance bonus plans in operation to differentiate and reward strong individual 
performance. Annual bonuses are paid in cash. There is also one senior staff long-term incentive scheme, under which approximately 70 
participants may be eligible for awards granted as AstraZeneca ADSs. AstraZeneca ADSs necessary to satisfy the awards are purchased in the 
market or funded via a share trust. The AstraZeneca Performance Share Plan and the AstraZeneca Global Restricted Stock Plan operate in 
respect of relevant employees in the US.
Share plans 
The charge for share-based payments in respect of share plans is $153m (2010: $120m; 2009: $81m). The plans are equity settled.
The AstraZeneca Performance Share Plan
This plan was approved by shareholders in 2005 for a period of 10 years. Generally, awards can be granted at any time, but not during a close 
period of the Company. The first grant of awards was made in June 2005. The main grant of awards in 2011 under the plan was in March, with 
a further smaller grant in August. Awards granted under the plan vest after three years and can be subject to the achievement of performance 
conditions. For awards to all participants in 2011, except employees of MedImmune, 50% of the award will vest subject to the performance of the 
Company’s total shareholder return (TSR) compared with that of a selected peer group of other pharmaceutical companies, and 50% will vest 
subject to the achievement of a net cash flow target. A separate performance condition applies to employees of MedImmune. The Remuneration 
Committee has responsibility for agreeing any awards under the plan and for setting the policy for the way in which the plan should be operated, 
including agreeing performance targets and which employees should be invited to participate. A fuller description of this plan can be found in 
the AstraZeneca Performance Share Plan section from page 120 in the Directors’ Remuneration Report.

with a further smaller grant in August. Awards granted under the plan vest after eight years and are subject to performance conditions measured 
over a period of between three and eight years. For awards granted in 2011, the performance conditions relate to the annual dividend paid to 
shareholders and dividend cover over a four-year performance period. The awards are then subject to a four-year holding period before they 
can vest. The Remuneration Committee has responsibility for agreeing any awards under the plan and for setting the policy for the way in which 
the plan should be operated, including agreeing performance targets and which employees should be invited to participate. A fuller description 
of this plan can be found in the AstraZeneca Investment Plan section from page 120 of the Directors’ Remuneration Report.

This plan was introduced in 2010 and replaces the AstraZeneca Pharmaceuticals LP Restricted Stock Unit Award Plan and the MedImmune, 
Inc. 2008 Restricted Stock Unit Award Plan described below. The main grant of awards in 2011 under the plan was in March, with a further 
smaller grant in August. This plan provides for the grant of restricted stock unit (RSU) awards to selected below SET-level employees and is 
used in conjunction with the AstraZeneca Performance Share Plan to provide a mix of RSUs and performance shares. Awards typically vest 
on the third anniversary of the date of grant and are contingent on continued employment with the Company. The Remuneration Committee 
has responsibility for agreeing any awards under the plan and for setting the policy for the way in which the plan should be operated.

(1) Summary of the AstraZeneca Savings-Related Share Option Plan (SAYE Scheme)
The AstraZeneca Savings-Related Share Option Plan was approved by shareholders in 2003 for a period of 10 years. The first grant of options 
under this plan was made in September 2003. 
Eligibility
UK-resident employees of participating AstraZeneca companies are automatically eligible to participate.
Grant of options
Invitations to apply for options may be issued within six weeks after the announcement by the Company of its results for any period and at other 
times in circumstances considered to be exceptional by the Directors. No invitations may be issued later than 10 years after the approval of 
the scheme by shareholders. Options may only be granted to employees who enter into HM Revenue & Customs-approved savings contracts 
with the savings body nominated by the Company, under which monthly savings of a fixed amount (currently not less than £5 nor more than 
£250) are made over a period of three or five years. The number of Ordinary Shares over which an option is granted will be such that the total 
amount payable on its exercise will be the proceeds on maturity of the related savings contract. No payment will be required for the grant of an 
option. Options are not transferable.
Individual participation
Monthly savings by an employee under all savings contracts linked to options granted under any Save As You Earn scheme may not exceed 
£250 or such lower amounts as may be determined by the Directors.
Acquisition price
The price per Ordinary Share payable upon the exercise of an option will not normally be less than the higher of:
a) 90% of the arithmetical average of the middle-market quotations for an Ordinary Share on the London Stock Exchange on three consecutive 
dealing days shortly before the date on which invitations to apply for options are issued (provided that no such day may fall before the Company 
last announced its results for any period) or such other dealing day or days falling within the six-week period for the issue of invitations, as the 
Directors may decide; and
b) the nominal value of an Ordinary Share (unless the option is expressed to relate only to existing Ordinary Shares).
Exercise of options
An option will normally be exercisable only for six months commencing on the third or fifth anniversary of the commencement of the related 
savings contract. Options are satisfied by the issue of new Ordinary Shares. Options normally lapse on cessation of employment. Exercise is, 
however, permitted for a limited period (irrespective of the period during which the option has been held) following cessation of employment in 
certain compassionate circumstances and/or where an option has been held for more than three years (except on dismissal for misconduct) 
and/or on an amalgamation, take-over or winding-up of the Company.
(2) Summary of the AstraZeneca Share Option Plan
This is a share option plan for employees of participating AstraZeneca Group companies which was approved by shareholders at the Company’s 
AGM in 2000. The first grant of options occurred in August 2000 for a period of 10 years. The final grant of options under the plan was in 
August 2009. There were no grants of options under the plan in 2010 and 2011, and no further grants will be made. Options are not transferable. 
Options were granted over AstraZeneca Ordinary Shares or ADSs.
Acquisition price
The price per Ordinary Share payable upon the exercise of an option is not less than an amount equal to the average of the middle-market 
closing price for an Ordinary Share or ADS of the Company on the London or New York Stock Exchange on the three consecutive dealing 
days immediately before the date of grant (or as otherwise agreed with HM Revenue & Customs). Where the option is an option to subscribe, 
the price payable upon exercise cannot be less than the nominal value of an Ordinary Share of the Company.
Exercise of options
An option will normally be exercisable between three and 10 years following its grant provided any relevant performance condition has been 
satisfied. Options may be satisfied by the issue of new Ordinary Shares or by existing Ordinary Shares purchased in the market. The Remuneration 
Committee sets the policy for the Company’s operation of the plan including as regards whether any performance target(s) will apply to the 
grant and/or exercise of each eligible employee’s option. Options normally lapse on cessation of employment. Exercise is, however, permitted 
for a limited period following cessation of employment either for reasons of injury or disability, redundancy or retirement, or at the discretion of 
the Remuneration Committee, and on an amalgamation, take-over or winding-up of the Company. Financial Statements

(3) Summary of the Zeneca 1994 Executive Share Option Scheme (1994 Scheme)
The Zeneca 1994 Executive Share Option Scheme was introduced in 1994. The last date for the grant of options was 16 March 2000 and the 
scheme was replaced by the AstraZeneca Share Option Plan. Options granted under the 1994 Scheme are normally exercisable between three 
and 10 years following grant, provided the relevant performance condition has been satisfied. Options are satisfied by the issue of new Ordinary 
Shares. The performance condition applicable to the 1994 Scheme was that earnings per share must have grown by at least the increase in the 
UK Retail Price Index over three years plus 3% per annum. Satisfaction of this condition was tested annually by reference to the audited financial 
statements. All options granted under the 1994 Scheme have become exercisable, the performance conditions having been satisfied. There 
are no longer any options outstanding under the 1994 Scheme, the remaining outstanding options having lapsed or been exercised in 2010.

Research and development collaboration payments
The Group has various ongoing collaborations including in-licensing and similar arrangements with development partners. Such collaborations may 
require the Group to make payments on achievement of stages of development, launch or revenue milestones although the Group generally has 
the right to terminate these agreements at no cost. The Group recognises research and development milestones as intangible assets once it is 
committed to payment, which is generally when the Group reaches set trigger points in the development cycle. Revenue-related milestones are 
recognised as intangible assets on product launch at a value based on the Group’s long-term revenue forecasts for the related product. The 
table below indicates potential development and revenue-related payments that the Group may be required to make under such collaborations.

The table includes all potential payments for achievement of milestones under ongoing research and development arrangements. Revenue-related 
milestone payments represent the maximum possible amount payable on achievement of specified levels of revenue as set out in individual 
contract agreements, but exclude variable payments that are based on unit sales (eg royalty-type payments) which are recognised as the 
associated sale is recognised in the comprehensive income statement. The table excludes any payments already capitalised in the financial 
statements for the year ended 31 December 2011 and excludes payments under the Merck agreements (detailed below).
The future payments we disclose represent contracted payments and, as such, are not discounted and are not risk adjusted. As detailed in  
the Principal risks and uncertainties section from page 130, the development of any pharmaceutical product candidate is a complex and risky 
process that may fail at any stage in the development process due to a number of factors (including items such as failure to obtain regulatory 
approval, unfavourable data from key studies, adverse reactions to the product candidate or indications of other safety concerns). The timing of  
the payments is based on the Group’s current best estimate of achievement of the relevant milestone.
Arrangements with Merck
Introduction
In 1982, Astra AB set up a joint venture with Merck & Co., Inc. (now 
Merck Sharp & Dohme Corp., a subsidiary of the new Merck & Co., Inc. 
that resulted from the merger with Schering-Plough) (Merck) for the 
purposes of selling, marketing and distributing certain Astra products 
in the US. In 1998, this joint venture was restructured (Restructuring). 
Under the agreements relating to the Restructuring (Agreements), a US 
limited partnership (Partnership) was formed, in which Merck is the 
limited partner and AstraZeneca is the general partner, and AstraZeneca 
obtained control of the joint venture’s business subject to certain limited 
partner and other rights held by Merck and its affiliates. These rights 
provide Merck with safeguards over the activities of the Partnership 
and place limitations on AstraZeneca’s commercial freedom to operate. 
The Agreements provided for:
 > A payment to Merck in the event of a business combination between 
Astra and a third party in order for Merck to relinquish certain claims 
to that third party’s products. 
 > Annual contingent payments.
 > Termination arrangements which cause Merck to relinquish its 
interests in AstraZeneca’s products and activities in stages, 
some of which are mandatory and others optional.
These elements are discussed in further detail below, together with 
a summary of their accounting treatments.
Payment in the event of a business combination
On the merger of Astra and Zeneca, a one-time lump sum payment of 
$809m was triggered. As a result of this payment, Merck relinquished 
any claims it may have had to Zeneca products. 
This payment was expensed at the point of merger since it caused no 
incremental benefits over the prior years’ aggregate Astra and Zeneca 
performance to accrue to the merged AstraZeneca entity.
Annual contingent payments
AstraZeneca makes ongoing payments to Merck based on sales 
of certain of its products in the US (the ‘contingent payments’ on 
the ‘agreement products’). Contingent payments in respect of 
Prilosec and Nexium will continue until the Second Option is exercised 
and consummated (as discussed under Second Option below). If 
AstraZeneca exercises the Second Option in 2012, contingent payments 
in respect of Prilosec and Nexium will cease in late 2012 or in early 
2013, depending on when AstraZeneca consummates the Second 
Option. If AstraZeneca does not exercise the Second Option in 2012, 
contingent payments in respect of Prilosec and Nexium will continue 
until at least 2017. Contingent payments in respect of the authorised 
generic version of felodipine will continue until AstraZeneca’s third 
party distribution arrangement ends, currently expected to occur in 
June 2012. Contingent payments on the other agreement products 
ceased in 2010 when AstraZeneca consummated the First Option 
(as discussed under First Option below).
The annual contingent payments on agreement products are expensed 
as incurred.
Termination arrangements
The Agreements provided for arrangements and payments under which, 
subject to the exercise of certain options, the rights and interests in 
AstraZeneca’s activities and products held by Merck immediately prior 
to the merger would be terminated, including details of:
 > the Advance Payment
 > the Partial Retirement
 > the True-Up
 > the Loan Note Receivable
 > the First Option
 > the Second Option. Financial Statements
AstraZeneca Annual Report and Form 20-F Information 2011 182 Financial Statements
Advance Payment
The merger between Astra and Zeneca in 1999 triggered the first step 
in the termination arrangements. Merck relinquished all rights, including 
contingent payments on future sales, to potential Astra products with 
no existing or pending US patents at the time of the merger. As a result, 
AstraZeneca now has rights to such products and is relieved of 
potential obligations to Merck and restrictions in respect of those 
products (including annual contingent payments), affording AstraZeneca 
substantial freedom to exploit the products as it sees fit.
At the time of the merger, the Advance Payment was paid. It was 
calculated as the then net present value of $2.8bn discounted from 
2008 to the date of merger at a rate of 13% per annum and amounted 
to $967m. It was subject to a true-up in 2008 (as discussed under 
True-Up below).
Partial Retirement
In March 2008, there was a partial retirement of Merck’s limited 
partnership interest by payment to Merck of an amount calculated 
as a multiple of the average annual contingent payments from 2005 to 
2007 on the relevant products, plus $750m. The payment was $4,271m.
Upon the Partial Retirement, Merck’s rights in respect of certain of 
the agreement products ended. The products covered by the Partial 
Retirement include Toprol-XL, Pulmicort, Rhinocort and Symbicort.
True-Up
In 2008, in accordance with the Agreements, there was a True-Up of 
the Advance Payment. The True-Up amount was based on a multiple 
of the average annual contingent payments from 2005 to 2007 in 
respect of all the agreement products with the exception of Prilosec and 
Nexium (subject to a minimum of $6.6bn), plus other defined amounts 
(totalling $912m). In accordance with the Agreements, the calculated 
amount was then reduced by the Appraised Value (as discussed under 
First Option below), the Partial Retirement payment and the Advance 
Payment (at its undiscounted amount of $2.8bn). This True-Up amount 
was settled in an amount equal to $241m paid by Merck to AstraZeneca.
Loan Note Receivable
Included in the assets and liabilities covered by the Restructuring was 
a loan note receivable by AstraZeneca from Merck with a face value 
of $1.38bn. In 2008, at the same time as the settlement of the Partial 
Retirement and the True-Up, Merck settled the loan note receivable 
by paying AstraZeneca $1.38bn.
If Merck had exercised the First Option in 2008, the net minimum 
payment that would have been made to Merck would have been $3.3bn, 
being the minimum combined payments of $4.7bn specified in the 
Agreements on the Partial Retirement, the True-Up and First Option, 
less the repayment of the loan note of $1.38bn. In accounting for the 
Restructuring in 1998, the loan note was included in the determination 
of the fair values of the assets and liabilities to be acquired. At that time, 
the loan note was ascribed a fair value of zero on acquisition and on 
the balance sheet, because it was estimated that the net minimum 
payment of $3.3bn equated to the fair value of the rights to be acquired 
under the Partial Retirement, True-Up and First Option.
First Option
In accordance with the Agreements, in 2008 a calculation was made of 
the Appraised Value, being the net present value of the future contingent 
payments in respect of all agreement products not covered by the 
Partial Retirement, other than Prilosec and Nexium. The Appraised 
Value was calculated in 2008 as $647m. 
Payment of the Appraised Value to Merck in March 2008 would have 
taken place only if Merck had exercised the First Option in 2008. Merck 
did not exercise this option. Under the Agreements AstraZeneca could 
exercise the First Option in the first two months of 2010 for a sum equal 
to the 2008 Appraised Value.
In 2010, AstraZeneca exercised the First Option. Payment of $647m 
to Merck was made on 30 April 2010. This payment resulted in 
AstraZeneca acquiring Merck’s interests in products covered by the 
First Option including Entocort, Atacand, Plendil and the authorised 
generic version of felodipine, and certain products then still in 
development (principally Brilinta and lesogaberan). On 30 April 2010, 
contingent payments on these products (except for the authorised 
generic version of felodipine) ceased with respect to periods after this 
date and AstraZeneca obtained the ability to exploit these products and 
other opportunities in the Cardiovascular and Neuroscience therapy 
areas. (Contingent payments on the authorised generic version of 
felodipine will continue until AstraZeneca’s third party distribution 
arrangement ends, which is currently expected to occur in June 2012.) 
As detailed in Note 9, the intangible asset relating to lesogaberan of 
$128m was subsequently impaired to a value of nil following a decision 
to terminate further development of this compound.
Second Option
AstraZeneca may exercise a Second Option to purchase Merck’s 
interests in the Merck affiliates that hold the limited partner and other 
rights referred to above. Exercise of the Second Option would result 
in the repurchase by AstraZeneca of Merck’s interests in Prilosec and 
Nexium in the US. This option is exercisable by AstraZeneca in May 
to October of 2012, or in 2017, or if combined annual sales of the two 
products fall below a minimum amount. If AstraZeneca exercises the 
Second Option, consummation of the transaction will occur five to six 
months later. AstraZeneca’s consummation of the Second Option will 
end the contingent payments in respect of Prilosec and Nexium and 
will effectively end AstraZeneca’s relationship with, and obligations 
to, Merck (other than some residual manufacturing arrangements). 
In September 2010, AstraZeneca and Merck reached an agreement 
with respect to the treatment of Vimovo under the Agreements, 
pursuant to which AstraZeneca will pay Merck certain amounts with 
respect to Vimovo only if it exercises the Second Option and as part 
of the exercise price for the Second Option.
The exercise price for the Second Option is the sum of the net present 
value of the future annual contingent payments on Nexium and Prilosec 
as determined at the time of exercise and the net present value of up to 
5% of future US sales of Vimovo, with the precise amount dependent 
on the level of annual sales and the timing of the option exercise, as 
well as 13 times Merck’s average annual 1% profit allocation in the 
Partnership for the prior three years. The exercise price of the Second 
Option cannot be determined at this time.
Accounting treatment of termination arrangements
AstraZeneca considers that the termination arrangements described 
above represent the acquisition, in stages, of Merck’s interests in 
the Partnership and agreement products (including Merck’s rights to 
contingent payments) and depend, in part, on the exercise of the First 
and Second Options. The effects will only be reflected in the financial 
statements as these stages are reached. If and when all such payments 
are made, AstraZeneca will have unencumbered discretion in its 
operations in the US market. 
AstraZeneca anticipates that the benefits that accrue under all of the 
termination arrangements arise:
 > Currently, from the substantial freedom over products acquired or 
discovered post-merger.
 > On occurrence of each stage of such arrangements, from enhanced 
contributions from, and substantial freedom over, those products 
that have already been launched (for example, Prilosec, Nexium, 
Brilinta, Pulmicort, Symbicort, Rhinocort and Atacand), and those 
that are in development.
Economic benefits include relief from contingent payments, anticipated 
cost savings from cessation of manufacturing arrangements and other 
cost efficiencies, together with the strategic advantages of increased 
freedom to operate. 
25 Commitments and contingent liabilities continued Financial Statements
AstraZeneca Annual Report and Form 20-F Information 2011 Financial Statements 183
The Advance Payment has been accounted for as an intangible asset 
and is being amortised over 20 years. This approach reflects the fact 
that, under the Agreements, AstraZeneca has acquired rights relieving 
it of potential obligations and restrictions in respect of Astra products 
with no existing or pending patents at the time of merger. Although 
these rights apply in perpetuity, the period of amortisation of 20 years 
has been chosen to reflect the typical timescale of development and 
marketing of a product. 
The net payment made in 2008, consisting of the Partial Retirement 
payment of $4.271bn less the True-Up amount of $241m and loan 
note receivable of $1.38bn, in total $2.6bn, has been capitalised as 
intangible assets. 
Part of the net payment made in 2008 resulted in AstraZeneca acquiring 
Merck’s interests in certain AstraZeneca products, including Pulmicort, 
Rhinocort, Symbicort and Toprol-XL. Consequently AstraZeneca no 
longer makes contingent payments on these products to Merck and 
has obtained the ability to fully exploit these products and to fully exploit 
other opportunities in the Respiratory therapy area that AstraZeneca 
was previously prevented from doing by Merck’s interests in these 
products. Intangible assets aggregating $994m have been recognised 
in respect of these acquired product rights and these are being 
amortised over various periods, giving rise to an annual expense of 
approximately $50m going forward. 
The balance of the net payment made in 2008 ($1,656m) represented 
‘non-refundable deposits’ for future product rights associated with 
the First and Second Options. In 2010, $647m was recognised as 
an intangible asset as a result of payment of the Appraised Value for 
the First Option (see page 182). Together with the $1,656m non-
refundable deposits recognised in 2008, the total sum of $2,303m 
was allocated as follows: $689m to contingent payment relief, 
$1,140m to intangible assets reflecting the ability to fully exploit the 
products in the Cardiovascular and Neuroscience therapy areas,  
and $474m as non-refundable deposits associated with the Second 
Option. The intangible assets recognised on exercise of the First 
Option give rise to an additional amortisation expense in the range  
of $20m to $40m per annum charged to cost of sales in respect of 
contingent payment relief, the precise amount dependent upon the 
launch status of the covered pipeline compounds, and an additional 
charge to SG&A of around $60m per annum. Amortisation on these 
intangible assets began when the $647m payment was made on  
30 April 2010. The remaining $474m relating to the non-refundable 
deposits will not be subject to amortisation until the Second Option 
is exercised and the related product rights are acquired. If the 
Second Option is exercised then amortisation related to the ability  
to exploit opportunities in the Gastrointestinal therapy area will 
commence, in the amount of around $100m per annum (charged to 
SG&A), as well as an as yet indeterminable amount of amortisation 
related to relief from contingent payments.
The intangible assets relating to purchased product rights and the 
intangible assets relating to non-refundable deposits are subject 
to impairment testing and would be partially or wholly impaired if a 
product is withdrawn or if activity in any of the affected therapy areas 
is significantly curtailed. Consequently, following the discontinuation 
of the development of lesogaberan in the third quarter of 2010, an 
impairment of $128m was recognised. As noted earlier, AstraZeneca 
has the ability to exercise the Second Option in 2012, 2017 or if 
combined annual sales of Prilosec and Nexium fall below a minimum 
amount. If we do not exercise the Second Option in 2012, this will 
trigger an impairment review of the non-refundable deposits of $474m 
associated with the Second Option. In addition, if it becomes 
probable that the Second Option will not be exercised, the non-
refundable deposits for the product rights available to be acquired 
under the Second Option will be expensed immediately.
25 Commitments and contingent liabilities continued Environmental costs and liabilities
The Group’s expenditure on environmental protection, including both 
capital and revenue items, relates to costs which are necessary for 
implementing internal systems and programmes, and meeting legal 
and regulatory requirements for processes and products.
They are an integral part of normal ongoing expenditure for carrying 
out the Group’s research, manufacturing and commercial operations 
and are not separated from overall operating and development costs. 
There are no known changes in legal, regulatory or other requirements 
resulting in material changes to the levels of expenditure for 2009, 
2010 or 2011.
In addition to expenditure for meeting current and foreseen environmental 
protection requirements, the Group incurs costs in investigating and 
cleaning up land and groundwater contamination. In particular, 
AstraZeneca has environmental liabilities at some currently or formerly 
owned, leased and third party sites.
In the US, Zeneca Inc., and/or its indemnitees, have been named as 
potentially responsible parties (PRPs) or defendants at approximately 
19 sites where Zeneca Inc. is likely to incur future environmental 
investigation, remediation, operation and maintenance costs under 
federal, state, statutory or common law environmental liability 
allocation schemes (together, US Environmental Consequences). 
Similarly, Stauffer Management Company LLC (SMC), which was 
established in 1987 to own and manage certain assets of Stauffer 
Chemical Company acquired that year, and/or its indemnitees, have 
been named as PRPs or defendants at 29 sites where SMC is likely 
to incur US Environmental Consequences. AstraZeneca has also 
given indemnities to third parties for a number of sites outside the US. 
These environmental liabilities arise from legacy operations that are 
not currently part of the Group’s business and, at most of these sites, 
remediation, where required, is either completed or nearing completion.
AstraZeneca has made provisions for the estimated costs of future 
environmental investigation, remediation, operation and maintenance 
activity beyond normal ongoing expenditure for maintaining the Group’s 
R&D and manufacturing capacity and product ranges, where a present 
obligation exists, it is probable that such costs will be incurred and 
they can be estimated reliably. With respect to such estimated future 
costs, there were provisions at 31 December 2011 in the aggregate 
of $92m (2010: $119m; 2009: $112m), mainly relating to the US. 
Where we are jointly liable or otherwise have cost sharing agreements 
with third parties, we reflect only our share of the obligation. Where 
the liability is insured in part or in whole by insurance or other 
arrangements for reimbursement, an asset is recognised to the 
extent that this recovery is virtually certain.
It is possible that AstraZeneca could incur future environmental 
costs beyond the extent of our current provisions. The extent of such 
possible additional costs is inherently difficult to estimate due to a 
number of factors, including: (1) the nature and extent of claims that 
may be asserted in the future; (2) whether AstraZeneca has or will have 
any legal obligation with respect to asserted or unasserted claims; 
(3) the type of remedial action, if any, that may be selected at sites 
where the remedy is presently not known; (4) the potential for recoveries 
from or allocation of liability to third parties; and (5) the length of time 
that the environmental investigation, remediation and liability allocation 
process can take. Notwithstanding and subject to the foregoing, we 
estimate the potential additional loss for future environmental 
investigation, remediation, remedial operation and maintenance activity 
above and beyond our provisions to be, in aggregate, between $50m 
to $90m (2010: $20m to $40m; 2009: $10m to $25m) which relates 
solely to the US. Financial Statements

Legal proceedings 
AstraZeneca is involved in various legal proceedings considered 
typical to its business, including actual or threatened litigation and/or 
actual or potential government investigations relating to employment 
matters, product liability, commercial disputes, pricing, sales and 
marketing practices, infringement of IP rights, the validity of certain 
patents and competition laws. The more significant matters are 
discussed below.
Most of the claims involve highly complex issues. Often these issues 
are subject to substantial uncertainties and, therefore, the probability 
of a loss, if any, being sustained and an estimate of the amount of any 
loss is difficult to ascertain. Consequently, for a majority of these claims, 
it is not possible to make a reasonable estimate of the expected 
financial effect, if any, that will result from ultimate resolution of the 
proceedings. In these cases, AstraZeneca discloses information with 
respect to the nature and facts of the cases.
With respect to each of the legal proceedings described below, other 
than those for which provision has been made, we are unable to make 
estimates of the possible loss or range of possible losses at this stage, 
other than as set forth in this section. We also do not believe that 
disclosure of the amount sought by plaintiffs, if known, would be 
meaningful with respect to those legal proceedings. This is due to 
a number of factors, including (1) the stage of the proceedings (in 
many cases trial dates have not been set) and the overall length 
and extent of pre-trial discovery; (2) the entitlement of the parties to  
an action to appeal a decision; (3) clarity as to theories of liability, 
damages and governing law; (4) uncertainties in timing of litigation; 
and (5) the possible need for further legal proceedings to establish 
the appropriate amount of damages, if any.
While there can be no assurance regarding the outcome of any of the 
legal proceedings referred to in this Note 25, based on management’s 
current and considered view of each situation, we do not currently 
expect them to have a material adverse effect on our financial position. 
This position could of course change over time, not least because of 
the factors referred to above.
In cases that have been settled or adjudicated, or where quantifiable 
fines and penalties have been assessed and which are not subject 
to appeal (or other similar forms of relief), or where a loss is probable 
and we are able to make a reasonable estimate of the loss, we indicate 
the loss absorbed or the amount of the provision accrued.
Where it is considered that the Group is more likely than not to prevail, 
legal costs involved in defending the claim are charged to profit as they 
are incurred.
Where it is considered that the Group has a valid contract which 
provides the right to reimbursement (from insurance or otherwise) 
of legal costs and/or all or part of any loss incurred or for which 
a provision has been established, and we consider recovery to be 
virtually certain, the best estimate of the amount expected to be 
received is recognised as an asset.
Assessments as to whether or not to recognise provisions or assets, 
and of the amounts concerned, usually involve a series of complex 
judgements about future events and can rely heavily on estimates 
and assumptions. AstraZeneca believes that the provisions recorded 
are adequate based on currently available information and that the 
insurance recoveries recorded will be received. However, given the 
inherent uncertainties involved in assessing the outcomes of these 
cases, and in estimating the amount of the potential losses and the 
associated insurance recoveries, we could in the future incur judgments 
or insurance settlements that could have a material adverse effect on 
our results in any particular period.
25 Commitments and contingent liabilities continued IP claims include challenges to the Group’s patents on various products 
or processes and assertions of non-infringement of patents. A loss 
in any of these cases could result in loss of patent protection on 
the related product. The consequences of any such loss could be 
a significant decrease in product sales, which could have a material 
adverse effect on our results. The lawsuits filed by AstraZeneca for 
patent infringement against companies that have filed ANDAs in the 
US, seeking to market generic forms of products sold by the Group 
prior to the expiry of the applicable patents covering these products, 
typically also involve allegations of non-infringement, invalidity and 
unenforceability of these patents by the ANDA filers. In the event that 
the Group is unsuccessful in these actions or the statutory 30-month 
stay expires before a ruling is obtained, the ANDA filers involved will 
also have the ability, subject to FDA approval, to introduce generic 
versions of the product concerned.
AstraZeneca has full confidence in, and will vigorously defend and 
enforce, its IP.
Over the course of the past several years, including in 2011, a significant 
number of commercial litigation claims in which AstraZeneca is involved 
have been resolved, particularly in the US, thereby reducing potential 
contingent liability exposure arising from such litigation. Similarly, 
in part due to patent litigation and settlement developments, greater 
certainty has been achieved regarding possible generic entry dates 
with respect to some of our patented products. At the same time, like 
other companies in the pharmaceutical sector and other industries, 
AstraZeneca continues to be subject to government investigations 
around the world.

US patent litigation/regulatory proceedings 
Several defendants appealed the 2010 decision in the US District 
Court for the District of Delaware finding in favour of AstraZeneca that 
the substance patent covering the active ingredient in Crestor tablets 
is valid, enforceable and infringed. The parties await the decision of 
the US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit (the Federal Circuit).
AstraZeneca is also engaged in patent litigation in the US District Court 
for the District of Delaware in which it contends that a §505(b)(2) NDA 
for rosuvastatin zinc tablets infringes the substance patent and other 
patents for Crestor tablets. The Court has scheduled a trial in this 
litigation to begin on 24 September 2012.  Financial Statements
AstraZeneca Annual Report and Form 20-F Information 2011 Financial Statements 185
AstraZeneca appealed the 2010 dismissal by the US District Court 
for the District of Delaware of patent infringement actions brought by 
AstraZeneca against numerous generic drug manufacturers regarding 
two method-of-use patents covering Crestor. The parties await the 
decision of the Federal Circuit.
In November 2011, AstraZeneca filed a Citizen Petition with the FDA 
in respect of Crestor requesting the FDA to withhold approval of any 
generic rosuvastatin drug product that omits from its labelling the 
diabetes-related warning and adverse reaction information which 
AstraZeneca was required to include in Crestor’s labelling when the 
FDA approved Crestor’s primary prevention of cardiovascular disease 
indication. The FDA is required to issue a decision by 12 May 2012. 
AstraZeneca is also defending a patent infringement lawsuit filed in 
April 2011 in the US District Court for the District of South Carolina 
by Palmetto Pharmaceuticals, LLC (Palmetto), which, among other 
claims, asserts that AstraZeneca’s Crestor sales induce infringement 
of a Palmetto patent. 
In December 2011, the Federal Circuit affirmed the summary judgment 
of the US District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania 
invalidating a Teva Pharmaceutical Industries LTD (Teva LTD) formulation 
patent, which Teva LTD had alleged was infringed by sales of Crestor. 
Patent/regulatory proceedings outside the US
AstraZeneca is engaged in proceedings in Australia, Brazil, Canada, 
Mexico, Portugal and Singapore regarding patent and/or regulatory 
exclusivity for Crestor. Generic drug manufacturers have commenced 
sales of generic rosuvastatin drug products in Brazil and Mexico.
In Canada, in January 2012, the Federal Court of Canada held 
a hearing in the patent proceeding involving Pharmascience Inc. 
The parties await the Court’s decision. In 2011, AstraZeneca  
reached settlements with Mylan Pharmaceuticals Inc. and Ranbaxy 
Pharmaceuticals Canada Inc. resolving the litigation regarding 
AstraZeneca’s Crestor substance patent; and, as part of the 
agreements, those companies may enter the Canadian market  
on 2 April 2012, or earlier, in certain circumstances. 
In Australia, in November 2011, AstraZeneca was informed that 
Apotex Pty Ltd. (Apotex) intended to start commercialising its generic 
rosuvastatin product. AstraZeneca sought and was granted a 
preliminary injunction. Apotex’s motion to vacate the injunction was 
heard on 31 January 2012. A decision is pending. In January 2012, 
AstraZeneca instituted proceedings against Watson Pharm Pty Ltd. 
(Watson) and Actavis Australia Pty Ltd. (Actavis) asserting infringement 
of various formulation and method patents for Crestor. AstraZeneca 
has applied for interlocutory relief against both Watson and Actavis, 
pending resolution of the infringement actions. Sandoz has agreed to 
an undertaking to refrain from launching a product pending decisions 
on the Apotex, Watson and Actavis injunctions.
Entocort EC (budesonide)

against AstraZeneca is also pending. The hearing of the damages 
action is scheduled to begin in March 2012.
Nexium (esomeprazole magnesium)
US patent litigation 
In May 2011 and January 2012, AstraZeneca entered into agreements, 
respectively, with each of Sandoz Inc. (Sandoz) and Lupin Limited 
(Lupin) settling AstraZeneca’s patent infringement actions against 
those entities. As part of those settlements, Sandoz and Lupin were 
granted licences to enter the US market with generic esomeprazole 
magnesium on 27 May 2014, subject to regulatory approval, or earlier, 
in certain circumstances. As previously disclosed, in 2008, AstraZeneca 
entered into a settlement agreement with Ranbaxy Pharmaceuticals, 
Inc. and Ranbaxy Laboratories Limited (together Ranbaxy) to settle 
the Ranbaxy ANDA patent litigation respecting Nexium. The settlement 
agreement allows Ranbaxy to commence sales of a generic version 
of Nexium under a licence from AstraZeneca on 27 May 2014.
In January 2012, AstraZeneca received a Paragraph IV Certification 
notice letter from Mylan Laboratories Limited (Mylan) stating that it had 
submitted an ANDA for approval to market esomeprazole magnesium 
capsules. Mylan alleges non-infringement and/or invalidity of three 
patents listed in the Orange Book in reference to Nexium. AstraZeneca 
is evaluating Mylan’s notice.
In December 2011, AstraZeneca received a Paragraph IV Certification 
notice letter from Torrent Pharmaceuticals Ltd. (Torrent) stating that 
it had submitted an ANDA for approval to market esomeprazole 
magnesium capsules. Torrent alleges non-infringement and/or invalidity 
of 11 patents listed in the Orange Book in reference to Nexium. In 
January 2012, AstraZeneca commenced a patent infringement action 
against Torrent in the US District Court for the District of New Jersey.
In June 2011, AstraZeneca received a Paragraph IV Certification 
notice letter from Hetero Drugs, Ltd. Unit III and Hetero USA Inc. 
(together, Hetero) stating that it had submitted an ANDA for approval 
to market esomeprazole magnesium capsules. Hetero alleges 
non-infringement and/or invalidity of 11 patents listed in the Orange 
Book in reference to Nexium. In July 2011, AstraZeneca commenced 
a patent infringement action against Hetero in the US District Court 
for the District of New Jersey.
In February 2011, AstraZeneca also commenced a patent infringement 
action in the US District Court for the District of New Jersey against 
Hanmi USA Inc. et al. in response to the filing of an NDA under 
§505(b)(2) for FDA approval to market 20mg and 40mg esomeprazole 
strontium capsules. The defendant alleges non-infringement or invalidity 
of 11 patents listed in the Orange Book with reference to Nexium. 
Patent/regulatory proceedings outside the US
AstraZeneca is involved in proceedings in several countries outside the 
US regarding patent and/or regulatory exclusivity for Nexium, including 
Australia, Austria, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, China, the Czech Republic, 
Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, 
Mexico, the Netherlands, Norway, Philippines, Poland, Portugal, 
Singapore, Slovenia, Sweden, Turkey, Ukraine and the UK. There is 
generic entry in many European markets. Outside of Europe, Canada 
is the only major market with generic entry.
In the European Patent Office (EPO), in June and July 2011, the 
Opposition Division of the EPO revoked EP 1020461 (the ’461 patent) 
(which relates to Nexium) and EP 1020460 (which relates to Nexium i.v.). 
AstraZeneca has appealed these decisions. 
AstraZeneca initiated infringement proceedings against Consilient 
Health Limited and Krka, d.d., Novo Mesto in September 2010 in the 
UK. These companies agreed not to launch their generic esomeprazole 
product pending the outcome of the main infringement case. 
AstraZeneca has undertaken to be liable for losses of the defendants 
and third parties if the injunction is lifted at a later date. In July 2011, 
the injunction was lifted at the request of AstraZeneca. In December 
2011, the parties agreed to settle the infringement case but 
AstraZeneca’s undertaking regarding liability remains in effect.

Japanese patients. In November 2011, the Tokyo High Court reversed 
the Tokyo District Court’s decision and ruled that neither AstraZeneca, 
nor the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare, had any 
liability for the Iressa product liability claims filed in the Tokyo District 
Court. The plaintiffs have appealed the Tokyo High Court decision to

of insurance coverage available), disputes continue with insurers about 
the availability of coverage under insurance policies. These policies have 
aggregate coverage limits of $300m. No insurance receivable can be 
recognised under applicable accounting standards at this time.
Commercial Litigation 
Nexium (esomeprazole magnesium)
Of the various putative class actions in the US alleging that 
AstraZeneca’s promotion, advertising and pricing of Nexium to 
physicians, consumers and third party payers was unfair, unlawful and 
deceptive, only two cases remain pending. In the Massachusetts State 
Court case, a bench trial has been set to commence on 9 October 
2012. The Delaware State Court case has been stayed since May 2005.
Seroquel (quetiapine fumarate)
Of the various state laws actions generally alleging that AstraZeneca 
made false and/or misleading statements in marketing and promoting 
Seroquel, AstraZeneca remains in litigation with the Attorneys General 
of Montana, New Mexico, South Carolina, Utah and Mississippi. In 2011, 
AstraZeneca reached settlement agreements in principle with the 
Attorneys General of the states of Arkansas and Alaska, and provisions 
have been taken.
In March 2011, the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed the 
November 2008 dismissal of a putative nationwide third party payer 
class action lawsuit which alleged that AstraZeneca promoted 
Seroquel for off-label uses and as superior to lower-cost alternative 
medicines. No further appeals were taken.
Synagis (palivizumab) 
In September 2011, AstraZeneca’s biologics unit, MedImmune, filed 
a declaratory judgment action against Abbott International, LLC 
(Abbott) in the Circuit Court for Montgomery County, Maryland 
seeking a declaratory judgment related to a contract dispute between 
the parties as to when the transfer price of Synagis would revert to 
a lower amount (the Reversion Event). Abbott moved to dismiss the 
action and MedImmune filed its opposition. A hearing on the motions 
has been set for 9 February 2012.
In September 2011, Abbott filed a parallel action in the Illinois State 
Court for breach of contract and for a declaratory judgment regarding 
the Reversion Event. MedImmune filed a motion to dismiss the action 
and Abbott filed a motion seeking to deposit the ‘disputed funds’ in 
escrow. Both MedImmune’s motion to dismiss and Abbott’s motion 
for escrow were heard on 19 January 2012. A ruling on those motions 
is expected by mid-February 2012.
Toprol-XL (metoprolol succinate) 
AstraZeneca is defending against anti-trust claims in the US regarding 
the listing and enforcement of patents protecting Toprol-XL, brought 
by both direct purchasers and end-payers. In 2011, AstraZeneca paid 
$35.75m in aggregate in connection with agreements to settle the 
claims of the putative class of direct purchasers and those plaintiffs who 
have opted-out of that class. A provision has been taken. AstraZeneca 
continues to defend against the remaining claims alleged by end-payers.
Other Commercial Litigation
Verus Pharmaceuticals litigation 
In June 2011, the US Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit affirmed 
the trial court’s dismissal of Verus Pharmaceuticals Inc.’s lawsuit, which 
had alleged breaches of several related collaboration agreements to 
develop novel paediatric asthma treatments.

Average Wholesale Price litigation
Of the various lawsuits against AstraZeneca and other pharmaceutical 
manufacturers involving allegations that, by causing the publication of 
allegedly inflated wholesale list prices, defendants caused entities to 
overpay for prescription drugs, AstraZeneca remains in litigation with 
the Attorneys General of the states of Kentucky, Louisiana, Oklahoma, 
Utah and Wisconsin. In 2011, AstraZeneca settled the cases brought 
by the Attorneys General of the states of Alaska, Idaho, Illinois, Kansas 
and Mississippi, and those settlement amounts have been paid. 
A provision has been taken.
AstraZeneca is currently pursuing an appeal before the Commonwealth 
of Kentucky Court of Appeals, seeking to reverse the judgment against 
it in the case brought by the Attorney General of Kentucky and the 
corresponding award of damages and penalties. Following the 
underlying 2009 trial, a Kentucky jury found AstraZeneca liable 
under the Commonwealth of Kentucky’s Consumer Protection and 
Medicaid Fraud statutes and awarded $14.72m in compensatory 
damages and $100 in punitive damages. The trial court subsequently 
awarded an additional $5.4m in statutory penalties. No provision has 
been recognised.
Medco qui tam litigation (Schumann)
AstraZeneca has been named as a defendant in a lawsuit filed in 
Federal Court in Philadelphia under the qui tam (whistleblower) 
provisions of the federal and certain state False Claims Acts alleging 
overpayments by federal and state governments resulting from alleged 
improper payments intended to influence the formulary status of Prilosec 
and Nexium to Medco and its customers. The action was initially filed 
in September 2003 but remained under seal until July 2009, at which 
time AstraZeneca was served with a copy of the amended complaint 
following the US government’s decision not to intervene in the case. 
AstraZeneca’s motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction remains pending.
Average Manufacturer’s Price qui tam litigation (Streck) 
AstraZeneca is one of several manufacturers named as a defendant 
in a lawsuit filed in the US Federal Court in Philadelphia under the  
qui tam (whistleblower) provisions of the federal and certain state False 
Claims Acts alleging inaccurate reporting of Average Manufacturer’s 
Prices to the Centers for Medicaid and Medicare Services. The action 
was initially filed in October 2008 but remained under seal until May 
2011, following the US government’s decision not to intervene in the 
case with regard to certain manufacturers, including AstraZeneca.  
In December 2011, the manufacturer defendants filed a joint motion 
to dismiss the complaint. 
340B Class Action litigation 
In March 2011, the US Supreme Court reversed a decision of the US 
Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit and held that covered entities 
under the 340B programme do not have enforceable rights to sue as 
third party beneficiaries of the Pharmaceutical Pricing Agreement. The 
putative class action suit filed by the County of Santa Clara on behalf 
of similarly situated California counties and cities was thereby dismissed.
Drug importation and anti-trust litigation 
In August 2004, Californian retail pharmacy plaintiffs filed an action in 
the Superior Court of California alleging a conspiracy by AstraZeneca 
and approximately 15 other pharmaceutical manufacturer defendants 
to set the price of drugs sold in California at or above the Canadian 
sales price for those same drugs and otherwise restrict the importation 
of pharmaceuticals into the US. In March 2011, the Superior Court  
of California granted the defendants’ motion for summary judgment. 
In April 2011, the plaintiffs appealed.
Employment – wage/hour litigation 
In September 2006, Marc Brody filed a putative class action lawsuit 
against AstraZeneca on behalf of himself and a class of sales specialists 
employed by the Group in California. The plaintiff alleged he and 
the proposed class members were unlawfully classified as exempt 
employees and denied overtime compensation and meal breaks in 
violation of the California Labor Code. The US District Court for the 
Central District of California granted summary judgment in favour of 
AstraZeneca. The plaintiff has filed a Notice of Appeal with the Ninth 
Circuit Court of Appeals in California. The case is currently stayed.
In November 2010, a separate group of plaintiffs’ counsel filed a 
nationwide collective action in the US District Court for the Southern 
District of Indiana against AstraZeneca, alleging violations of federal 
wage-and-hour law for non-payment of overtime wages. The plaintiff 
voluntarily dismissed the case with prejudice in March 2011.
In January 2011, a third group of plaintiffs’ attorneys filed a separate 
nationwide collective action against AstraZeneca, alleging that 
AstraZeneca violated federal wage-and-hour law by failing to pay 
overtime compensation to pharmaceutical sales representatives 
across the country. The court has stayed the case pending a decision 
from the US Supreme Court in Christopher v. Smithkline Beecham 
Corp., Case No. 11-204, which is addressing similar issues in the 
pharmaceutical sales context.
Government investigations/proceedings 
Except as otherwise noted, the precise parameters of the following 
inquiries are unknown, and AstraZeneca is not in a position at this 
time to predict the scope, duration or outcome of these matters, 
including whether they will result in any liability to AstraZeneca.
Losec/Prilosec (omeprazole)
European Commission case
AstraZeneca is awaiting a ruling on the cross-appeals from the General 
Court of the EU’s judgment regarding the European Commission’s 
2005 Decision fining AstraZeneca €60m (reduced to €52.5m by the 
General Court) for abuse of a dominant position regarding omeprazole. 
An oral hearing took place on 12 January 2012. 
Nexium (esomeprazole magnesium)
European Commission investigation
The European Commission investigation into alleged practices 
regarding Nexium and alleged breaches of EU competition laws, 
which commenced in November 2010, remains pending.
Dutch Competition Authority investigation 
The Dutch National Competition Authority (NMa) investigation into 
alleged practices regarding Nexium and alleged breaches of both 
Dutch and EU competition laws is ongoing. In December 2011, the 
investigation team issued a report alleging foreclosure of generic 
versions of certain proton pump inhibitors. The file has now been 
passed to the Legal Department of the NMa. 
US FTC Civil Investigative Demand
AstraZeneca has completed its response to the 2008 Civil Investigative 
Demand from the US Federal Trade Commission seeking information 
regarding the Nexium patent litigation settlement with Ranbaxy 
Laboratories Ltd.
Department of Justice/Attorney General of Texas investigation
AstraZeneca has received a subpoena from the Department of Justice 
and a Civil Investigative Demand issued by the Attorney General of 
Texas in connection with an investigation of the possible submission of 
false or otherwise improper pricing information for certain formulations 
of Nexium to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS). 
Other government investigations/proceedings
Foreign Corrupt Practices Act 
In connection with an investigation into Foreign Corrupt Practices 
Act issues in the pharmaceutical industry, AstraZeneca has received 
inquiries from the US Department of Justice and the SEC regarding, 
among other things, sales practices, internal controls, certain 
distributors and interactions with healthcare providers in several 
countries. AstraZeneca is cooperating with these inquiries. AstraZeneca 
is investigating indications of inappropriate conduct in certain countries, 
including China.

Serbia 
In August 2011, AstraZeneca UK Limited’s Representative Office in 
Belgrade, Serbia was served with a criminal indictment alleging that 
local employees of AstraZeneca and several other pharmaceutical 
companies who are also named defendants in the indictment, made 
allegedly improper payments to physicians at the Institute of Oncology 
and Radiology of Serbia. AstraZeneca filed a number of preliminary 
procedural objections asking the Serbian criminal court to dismiss 
the indictment against the Representative Office and those objections 
were granted in November 2011. The Serbian prosecutor then 
amended and re-served the indictment and, in December 2011, 
AstraZeneca asked the Court again to dismiss the indictment. 
Korea 
In September 2011, the Korean Fair Trade Commission (KFTC) 
announced administrative fines against AstraZeneca and five other 
pharmaceutical companies as a result of the third and final wave of its 
investigation into alleged unfair trade practices related to interactions 
between the local pharmaceutical industry and Korean healthcare 
providers. AstraZeneca was fined KRW 1,512m ($1.24m), but was not 
referred to the public prosecutor for criminal proceedings. The KFTC’s 
final investigation report was provided to AstraZeneca in November 
2011 and alleges that AstraZeneca induced prescriptions through 
improper marketing to physicians in 2006 and 2007, yet recognises 
that such alleged unfair conduct stopped in 2007 after AstraZeneca 
voluntarily implemented an improved and effective compliance 
programme across its business.
Other US Attorney’s Offices and/or  
State Attorneys’ General investigations
The US Attorney’s Offices in Alabama, Delaware and Texas are 
conducting investigations related to sales and marketing activities 
potentially involving more than one product, including Crestor and 
Seroquel XR, in response to the filing of qui tam (whistleblower) lawsuits.
The US Attorney’s Office for the District of Delaware, Criminal Division, 
is conducting an investigation relating to AstraZeneca’s relationship 
with Medco and sales of Nexium, Plendil, Toprol-XL and Prilosec. 
In November 2006, AstraZeneca was notified of an inquiry by the US 
Attorney’s Office for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania regarding 
whether a payment made by AstraZeneca to Advance PCS was taken 
into account when calculating best price. In December 2011, the matter 
was resolved in principle with CMS and the Department of Justice.
In June 2011, MedImmune received a demand from the US Attorney’s 
Office for the Southern District of New York requesting certain 
documents related to the sales and marketing activities of Synagis. 
In July 2011, MedImmune received a similar court order to produce 
documents from the Office of the Attorney General for the State of 
New York Medicaid and Fraud Control Unit. MedImmune is coordinating 
with the Government offices to provide the appropriate responses 
and cooperate with any related investigation. 
Tax
Where tax exposures can be quantified, an accrual is made based on 
best estimates and management’s judgement. Details of the movements 
in relation to material tax exposures are discussed below. As accruals 
can be built up over a long period of time but the ultimate resolution of 
tax exposures usually occurs at a point in time and given the inherent 
uncertainties in assessing the outcomes of these exposures (which 
sometimes can be binary in nature), we could in future periods 
experience adjustments to these accruals that have a material positive 
or negative effect on our results in any particular period.
Transfer pricing and other international tax contingencies
The total net accrual included in the Group Financial Statements to 
cover the worldwide exposure to transfer pricing audits is $649m, 
a reduction of $1,661m compared to 2010 primarily due to the 
agreement announced in March 2011, referred to below.
In March 2011, AstraZeneca announced that HM Revenue & Customs 
in the UK and the US Internal Revenue Service agreed the terms of an 
Advance Pricing Agreement regarding transfer pricing arrangements 
for AstraZeneca’s US business for the period from 2002 to the end of 
2014, and a related valuation matter arising on integration of the legacy 
Astra and legacy Zeneca US businesses in 2000 following the global 
AstraZeneca merger in 1999. Based on these agreements, AstraZeneca 
paid a net amount of $1,133m during 2011 to resolve all US transfer 
pricing and related valuation matters for all periods from 2000 to the end 
of 2010 and this net amount reflects expected US tax payments and 
updated estimates of corresponding tax refunds in other jurisdictions. 
As a consequence of this agreement, AstraZeneca released a portion 
of the provision related to these matters resulting in a benefit to earnings 
in the year of $520m.
AstraZeneca faces a number of transfer pricing audits in jurisdictions 
around the world and, in some cases, is in dispute with the tax 
authorities. The issues under discussion are often complex and can 
require many years to resolve. Accruals for tax contingencies require 
management to make estimates and judgements with respect to the 
ultimate outcome of a tax audit, and actual results could vary from these 
estimates. The international tax environment presents increasingly 
challenging dynamics for the resolution of transfer pricing disputes. 
These disputes usually result in taxable profits being increased in one 
territory and correspondingly decreased in another. Our balance sheet 
positions for these matters reflect appropriate corresponding relief in 
the territories affected. Management considers that at present such 
corresponding relief will be available, but given the challenges in the 
international tax environment will keep this aspect under careful review.
Management continues to believe that AstraZeneca’s positions on all 
its transfer pricing audits and disputes are robust and that AstraZeneca 
is appropriately provided. 
For transfer pricing audits where AstraZeneca and the tax authorities 
are in dispute, AstraZeneca estimates the potential for reasonably 
possible additional losses above and beyond the amount provided to 
be up to $375m (2010: $565m); however, management believes that it 
is unlikely that these additional losses will arise. It is possible that some 
of these contingencies may reduce in the future to the extent that any 
tax authority challenge is unsuccessful, or matters lapse following 
expiry of the relevant statutes of limitation resulting in a reduction in 
the tax charge in future periods.
Other tax contingencies
Included in the tax accrual is $1,672m relating to a number of other tax 
contingencies, an increase of $243m mainly due to the impact of an 
additional year of transactions relating to contingencies for which 
accruals had already been established and exchange rate effects. For 
these tax exposures, AstraZeneca does not expect material additional 
losses. It is, however, possible that some of these contingencies may 
reduce in the future if any tax authority challenge is unsuccessful or 
matters lapse following expiry of the relevant statutes of limitation 
resulting in a material reduction in the tax charge in future periods.
Timing of cash flows and interest
It is not possible to estimate the timing of tax cash flows in relation to 
each outcome, however, it is anticipated that a number of significant 
disputes may be resolved over the next one to two years. Included in 
the provision is an amount of interest of $291m (2010: $608m). Interest 
is accrued as a tax expense.

Company Accounting Policies
Basis of accounting
The Company Financial Statements are prepared under the historical 
cost convention, modified to include revaluation to fair value of certain 
financial instruments as described below, in accordance with the 
Companies Act 2006 and UK Generally Accepted Accounting Practice 
(UK GAAP). The Group Financial Statements are presented on pages 
142 to 191 and have been prepared in accordance with International 
Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the EU and as issued by 
the IASB and in accordance with the Group Accounting Policies set 
out on pages 146 to 149.
The following paragraphs describe the main accounting policies under 
UK GAAP, which have been applied consistently.
New accounting standards
The Company has adopted the Amendments to FRS 25 (IAS 32) 
‘Financial Instruments: Presentation Classification of Rights Issues’, 
Abstract 47 ‘Extinguishing Financial Liabilities with Equity Instruments’ 
and ‘Improvements to Financial Reporting Standards 2010’ (November 
2010) during the year. The adoptions had no impact on the net results 
or net assets of the Company.
The Amendments to FRS 29 (IFRS 7) ‘Disclosures – Transfers of 
Financial Assets’ has been issued but not yet adopted by the Company.
Foreign currencies
Profit and loss account items in foreign currencies are translated 
into US dollars at average rates for the relevant accounting periods. 
Assets and liabilities are translated at exchange rates prevailing at the 
date of the Company Balance Sheet. Exchange gains and losses on 
loans and on short-term foreign currency borrowings and deposits 
are included within net interest payable. Exchange differences on all 
other transactions, except relevant foreign currency loans, are taken 
to operating profit.
Taxation
The charge for taxation is based on the result for the year and takes 
into account taxation deferred because of timing differences between 
the treatment of certain items for taxation and for accounting purposes. 
Full provision is made for the effects of these differences. Deferred tax 
assets are recognised where it is more likely than not that the amount 
will be realised in the future. These estimates require judgements to 
be made including the forecast of future taxable income. Deferred tax 
balances are not discounted.
Accruals for tax contingencies require management to make 
judgements and estimates in relation to tax audit issues. Tax benefits 
are not recognised unless the tax positions will probably be sustained. 
Once considered to be probable, management reviews each material 
tax benefit to assess whether a provision should be taken against full 
recognition of that benefit on the basis of potential settlement through 
negotiation and/or litigation.
Any recorded exposure to interest on tax liabilities is provided for in the 
tax charge. All provisions are included in creditors due within one year.
Investments
Fixed asset investments, including investments in subsidiaries, are 
stated at cost and reviewed for impairment if there are indications that 
the carrying value may not be recoverable.
Share-based payments
The issuance by the Company to employees of its subsidiaries of 
a grant over the Company’s options represents additional capital 
contributions by the Company to its subsidiaries. An additional 
investment in subsidiaries results in a corresponding increase in 
shareholders’ equity. The additional capital contribution is based on 
the fair value of the grant issued, allocated over the underlying grant’s 
vesting period.
Financial instruments
Loans and other receivables are held at amortised cost. Long-term 
loans payable are held at amortised cost.
Litigation
Through the normal course of business, the AstraZeneca Group is 
involved in legal disputes, the settlement of which may involve cost 
to the Company. Provision is made where an adverse outcome is 
probable and associated costs can be estimated reliably. In other 
cases, appropriate descriptions are included. AstraZeneca Annual Report and Form 20-F Information 2011 Financial Statements 195

Foreign Corrupt Practices Act 
In connection with an investigation into Foreign Corrupt Practices Act issues in the pharmaceutical industry, AstraZeneca has received inquiries 
from the US Department of Justice and the SEC regarding, among other things, sales practices, internal controls, certain distributors and 
interactions with healthcare providers in several countries. AstraZeneca is cooperating with these inquiries. AstraZeneca is investigating 
indications of inappropriate conduct in certain countries, including China. 
European Commission investigation 
The European Commission investigation into alleged practices regarding Nexium and alleged breaches of EU competition laws, which was 
commenced in November 2010, remains pending.
European Commission case
AstraZeneca is awaiting a ruling on the cross-appeals from the General Court of the EU’s judgment regarding the European Commission’s 
2005 Decision fining AstraZeneca €60m (reduced to €52.5m by the General Court) for abuse of a dominant position regarding omeprazole. 
An oral hearing took place on 12 January 2012.
Dutch Competition Authority investigation 
The Dutch National Competition Authority (NMa) investigation into alleged practices regarding Nexium and alleged breaches of both Dutch and

taxation of Group companies and income received from companies owned 50% or less, plus fixed charges. Fixed charges consist of interest 
on all indebtedness, amortisation of debt discount and expense and that portion of rental expense representative of the interest factor.
Group Financial Record Development Pipeline
at 31 December 2011
Throughout the development process, we strive to obtain patent protection consistent with our patent process (as described in the Intellectual 
Property section from page 34). However, until marketing approval in individual countries is obtained, it is not possible to accurately predict the 
maximum period of product protection available from any such patents. While the most significant uncertainties for development pipeline 
products progressing to launch are meeting development targets and obtaining regulatory marketing approvals (as detailed in the Risk section 
from page 129), the date and language of any actual marketing approval will crucially determine the length of Patent Term Extension and the full 
range, if any, of pending patents that will protect the marketed product. Further details of possible periods of patent, RDP and related IP 
protections which may protect pipeline products once marketed are included on page 35.

 Includes Euroclear and ADR holdings.
At 31 December 2011, the Company had 119,435 registered holders of 1,292,355,052 Ordinary Shares. At 31 December 2011, there were 
approximately 209,000 holders of ADRs representing 8.6% of the issued share capital of the Company and 136,000 holders of Ordinary Shares 
held under the Euroclear Services Agreement representing 15.3% of the issued share capital of the Company. The ADRs, each of which is 
equivalent to one Ordinary Share, are issued by JPMorgan Chase Bank (JPMorgan).
During 2011, under AstraZeneca’s share repurchase programme, which was introduced in 1999, 127.4 million Ordinary Shares were 
repurchased and subsequently cancelled at a total cost of $6,015 million, representing 9.9% of the total issued share capital of the Company at 
31 December 2011. The average price paid per share in 2011 was 2932 pence. This brings the total number of Ordinary Shares repurchased to 
date since the beginning of the repurchase programme in 1999, to 557 .4 million Ordinary Shares (at an average price of 2767 pence per Ordinary 
Share) for a consideration, including expenses, of $26,717 million. The excess of the consideration over the nominal value was charged against 
the profit and loss account reserve. Ordinary Shares issued in respect of share schemes totalled 10.7 million.
In 1999, in connection with the merger between Astra and Zeneca through which the Company was formed, the Company’s share capital was 
redenominated in US dollars. On 6 April 1999, Zeneca shares were cancelled and US dollar shares issued, credited as fully paid on the basis of 
one dollar share for each Zeneca share then held. This was achieved by a reduction of capital under section 135 of the Companies Act 1985. 
Upon the reduction of capital becoming effective, all issued and unissued Zeneca shares were cancelled and the sum arising as a result of the 
share cancellation credited to a special reserve, which was converted into US dollars at the rate of exchange prevailing on the record date. This 
US dollar reserve was then applied in paying up, at par, newly created US dollar shares.
At the same time as the US dollar shares were issued, the Company issued 50,000 Redeemable Preference Shares for cash, at par. The 
Redeemable Preference Shares carry limited class voting rights, no dividend rights and are capable of redemption, at par, at the option of the 
Company on the giving of seven days’ written notice to the registered holder of the Redeemable Preference Shares.
A total of 826 million Ordinary Shares were issued to Astra shareholders who accepted the merger offer before the final closing date, 21 May 
1999. The Company received acceptances from Astra shareholders representing 99.6% of Astra’s shares and the remaining 0.4% was acquired 
in 2000, for cash.
Since April 1999, following the merger of Astra and Zeneca, the principal markets for trading in the shares of the Company are the London 
Stock Exchange (LSE), the Stockholm Stock Exchange (SSE) and the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE). The table below sets out, for 2010 
and 2011, the reported high and low share prices of the Company, on the following bases:

the donation. Further information about ShareGift can be found on its website, sharegift.org, or by contacting ShareGift on 020 7930 3737 or at 
17 Carlton House Terrace, London SW1Y 5AH. ShareGift is administered by The Orr Mackintosh Foundation, registered charity number

The Unclaimed Assets Register
The Company supplies unclaimed dividend data to the Unclaimed Assets Register (UAR), which provides investors who have lost track of 
shareholdings with an opportunity to search the UAR’s database of unclaimed financial assets on payment of a small fixed fee. The UAR 
donates part of the search fee to charity. The UAR can be contacted on 0870 241 1713 or at PO Box 9501, Nottingham NG80 1WD.

Taxation for US residents
The following summary of material UK and US federal income tax consequences of ownership of Ordinary Shares or ADRs held as capital 
assets by the US resident holders described below is based on current UK and US federal income tax law, including the US/UK double taxation 
convention relating to income and capital gains, which entered into force on 31 March 2003 (the Convention). This summary does not describe 
all of the tax consequences that may be relevant in light of the US resident holders’ particular circumstances and tax consequences applicable 
to US resident holders subject to special rules (such as certain financial institutions, entities treated as partnerships for US federal income tax 
purposes, persons whose functional currency for US federal income tax purposes is not the US dollar, tax-exempt entities, or persons holding 
Ordinary Shares or ADRs in connection with a trade or business conducted outside of the United States). US resident holders are urged to 
consult their tax advisers regarding the UK and US federal income tax consequences of the ownership and disposition of Ordinary Shares or 
ADRs in their particular circumstances. 
This summary is based in part on representations of JPMorgan as depositary for ADRs and assumes that each obligation in the deposit 
agreement among the Company, JPMorgan and the holders from time to time of ADRs and any related agreements will be performed in 
accordance with its terms. The US Treasury has expressed concerns that parties to whom American depository shares are released before 
shares are delivered to the depositary (pre-release), or intermediaries in the chain of ownership between holders and the issuer of the security 
underlying the American depository shares, may be taking actions that are inconsistent with the claiming, by US holders of American depository 
shares, of foreign tax credits for US federal income tax purposes. Such actions would also be inconsistent with the claiming of the reduced tax 
rates, described below, applicable to dividends received by certain non-corporate US resident holders. Accordingly, the availability of the 
reduced tax rates for dividends received by certain non-corporate US resident holders could be affected by actions that may be taken by 
parties to whom ADRs are pre-released.
For purposes of this summary, the term ‘US resident holder’ means a beneficial owner of Ordinary Shares or ADRs that is, for US federal 
income tax purposes, a citizen or resident of the US, a corporation (or other entity taxable as a corporation) created or organised in or under the 
laws of the US, any state in the US or the District of Columbia, or an estate or trust the income of which is subject to US federal income taxation 
regardless of its source.
This summary assumes that we are not, and will not become, a passive foreign investment company, as discussed below.
UK and US income taxation of dividends
The UK does not currently impose a withholding tax on dividends paid by a UK company, such as the Company.
For US federal income tax purposes, distributions paid by the Company to a US resident holder are included in gross income as foreign source 
ordinary dividend income to the extent paid out of the Company’s current or accumulated earnings and profits, calculated in accordance with 
US federal income tax principles. Because the Company does not maintain calculations of its earning and profits under US federal income tax 
principles, it is expected that distributions generally will be reported to US resident holders as dividends. The amount of the dividend will be  
the US dollar amount received by the depositary for US resident holders of ADRs (or, in the case of Ordinary Shares, the US dollar value of the 
pounds sterling payments made, determined at the spot pound sterling/US dollar rate on the date the dividend is received by the US resident 
holders, regardless of whether the dividend is converted into US dollars), and it will not be eligible for the dividends received deduction generally 
available to US corporations. If the dividend is converted into US dollars on the date of receipt, US resident holders of Ordinary Shares generally 
should not be required to recognise foreign currency gains or losses in respect of the dividend income. They may have foreign currency gain or 
loss if the amount of such dividend is not converted into US dollars on the date of its receipt.
Subject to applicable limitations and the discussion above regarding concerns expressed by the US Treasury, dividends received by certain 
non-corporate US resident holders of Ordinary Shares or ADRs in taxable years beginning before 1 January 2013 may be taxable at favourable 
US federal income tax rates, up to a maximum rate of 15%. US resident holders should consult their own tax advisers to determine whether 
they are subject to any special rules which may limit their ability to be taxed at this favourable rate.
Taxation on capital gains
Under present UK law, individuals who are neither resident nor ordinarily resident in the UK, and companies which are not resident in the UK, 
will not be liable for UK tax on capital gains made on the disposal of their Ordinary Shares or ADRs, unless such Ordinary Shares or ADRs are 
held in connection with a trade, profession or vocation carried on in the UK through a branch or agency or other permanent establishment.
A US resident holder will generally recognise US source capital gains or losses for US federal income tax purposes on the sale or exchange of 
Ordinary Shares or ADRs in an amount equal to the difference between the US dollar amount realised and such holder’s US dollar adjusted tax 
basis in the Ordinary Shares or ADRs. US resident holders should consult their own tax advisers about the treatment of capital gains, which may 
be taxed at lower rates than ordinary income for non-corporate US resident holders and capital losses, the deductibility of which may be limited.
Passive Foreign Investment Company (PFIC) rules
We believe that we were not a PFIC for US federal income tax purposes for the year ended 31 December 2011. However, since PFIC status 
depends on the composition of our income and assets and the market value of our assets (including, among others, less than 25% owned 
equity investments) from time to time, there can be no assurance that we will not be considered a PFIC for any taxable year. If we were  
treated as a PFIC for any taxable year during which Ordinary Shares or ADRs were held, certain adverse tax consequences could apply  
to US resident holders.
AstraZeneca Annual Report and Form 20-F Information 2011 206 Shareholder Information Information reporting and backup withholding
Payments of dividends and sales proceeds that are made within the US or through certain US-related financial intermediaries generally are 
subject to information reporting, and may be subject to backup withholding, unless (i) the US resident holder is a corporation or other exempt 
recipient or (ii) in the case of backup withholding, the US resident holder provides a correct taxpayer identification number and certifies that it is 
not subject to backup withholding. The amount of any backup withholding from a payment to a US resident holder will be allowed as a credit 
against the holder’s US federal income tax liability and may entitle the holder to a refund, provided that the required information is supplied to 
the IRS on time.
Certain US resident holders who are individuals, or are controlled by individuals, may be required to report information relating to securities 
issued by non-US persons, generally on IRS Form 8938, subject to certain exceptions (including an exception for securities held through US 
financial institutions). US resident holders should consult their tax advisers regarding their reporting obligations with respect to the Ordinary 
Shares or ADRs.
UK inheritance tax
Under the current Double Taxation (Estates) Convention (the Estate Tax Convention) between the US and the UK, Ordinary Shares or ADRs  
held by an individual shareholder who is domiciled for the purposes of the Estate Tax Convention in the US, and is not for the purposes of the 
Estate Tax Convention a national of the UK, will generally not be subject to UK inheritance tax on the individual’s death or on a chargeable gift  
of the Ordinary Shares or ADRs during the individual’s lifetime, provided that any applicable US federal gift or estate tax liability is paid, unless 
the Ordinary Shares or ADRs are part of the business property of a permanent establishment of the individual in the UK or, in the case of a 
shareholder who performs independent personal services, pertain to a fixed base situated in the UK. Where the Ordinary Shares or ADRs have 
been placed in trust by a settlor who, at the time of settlement, was a US domiciled shareholder, the Ordinary Shares or ADRs will generally not 
be subject to UK inheritance tax unless the settlor, at the time of settlement, was a UK national, or the Ordinary Shares or ADRs are part of the 
business property of a permanent establishment of the individual in the UK or, in the case of a shareholder who performs independent personal 
services, pertain to a fixed base situated in the UK. In the exceptional case where the Ordinary Shares or ADRs are subject to both UK 
inheritance tax and US federal gift or estate tax, the Estate Tax Convention generally provides for double taxation to be relieved by means of 
credit relief.
UK stamp duty reserve tax and stamp duty
A 1.5% stamp duty reserve tax is payable upon the deposit of Ordinary Shares in connection with the creation of, but not subsequent dealing in, 
ADRs. A 0.5% stamp duty is payable on all purchases of Ordinary Shares.
Exchange controls and other limitations affecting security holders
There are no governmental laws, decrees or regulations in the UK restricting the import or export of capital or affecting the remittance of 
dividends, interest or other payments to non-resident holders of Ordinary Shares or ADRs.
There are no limitations under English law or the Articles on the right of non-resident or foreign owners to be the registered holders of, or to 
exercise voting rights in relation to, Ordinary Shares or ADRs or to be registered holders of notes or debentures of Zeneca Wilmington Inc.  
or the Company.

Shareholder Information 207 History and development of the Company
AstraZeneca PLC was incorporated in England and Wales on 17 June 
1992 under the Companies Act 1985. It is a public limited company 
domiciled in the UK. The Company’s registered number is 2723534 
and its registered office is at 2 Kingdom Street, London W2 6BD 
(telephone +44 (0)20 7604 8000). From February 1993 until April 1999, 
the Company was called Zeneca Group PLC. On 6 April 1999, the 
Company changed its name to AstraZeneca PLC.
The Company was formed when the pharmaceutical, agrochemical 
and specialty chemical businesses of Imperial Chemical Industries 
PLC were demerged in 1993. In 1999, the Company sold the specialty 
chemical business. Also in 1999, the Company merged with Astra of 
Sweden. In 2000, it demerged the agrochemical business and 
merged it with the similar agribusiness of Novartis to form a new 
company called Syngenta AG.
In 2007, the Group acquired MedImmune, a biologics and vaccines 
business based in the US.
The Group owns and operates numerous R&D, production and 
marketing facilities worldwide. Its corporate office is at 2 Kingdom 
Street, London W2 6BD.
Articles
Objects
The Company’s objects were originally set out in its Memorandum of 
Association. By operation of law, on 1 October 2009, these objects 
were deemed to be provisions of the Articles. However, by a special 
resolution of the shareholders at the Company’s AGM held on 29 April 
2010, those deemed objects were deleted from the Articles. The 
Company’s objects are now unrestricted.
Any amendment to the Articles requires the approval of shareholders 
by a special resolution at a general meeting of the Company.
Directors
The Board has the authority to manage the business of the Company, 
for example, through powers to allot and repurchase its shares, 
subject where required to shareholder resolutions. Subject to certain 
exceptions, Directors do not have power to vote at Board meetings on 
matters in which they have a material interest.
The quorum for meetings of the Board is a majority of the full Board, of 
whom at least four must be Non-Executive Directors. In the absence of 
a quorum, the Directors do not have power to determine compensation 
arrangements for themselves or any member of the Board.
The Board may exercise all the powers of the Company to borrow 
money. Variation of these borrowing powers would require the passing 
of a special resolution of the Company’s shareholders.
All Directors must retire from office at the Company’s AGM each year 
and may present themselves for election or re-election. Directors are 
not prohibited, upon reaching a particular age, from submitting 
themselves for election or re-election.
Within two months of the date of their appointment, Directors are 
required to beneficially own Ordinary Shares of an aggregate nominal 
amount of $125, which currently represents at least 500 shares.
Rights, preferences and restrictions attaching to shares
As at 31 December 2011, the Company had 1,292,355,052 Ordinary 
Shares and 50,000 Redeemable Preference Shares in issue. The 
Ordinary Shares represent 99.98% and the Redeemable Preference 
Shares represent 0.02% of the Company’s total share capital (these 
percentages have been calculated by reference to the closing 
mid-point US$/GBP exchange rate on 31 December 2011 as 
published in the London edition of the Financial Times newspaper). As 
agreed by the shareholders at the Company’s AGM held on 29 April 
2010, the Articles were amended with immediate effect to remove the 
requirement for the Company to have an authorised share capital, the 
concept of which was abolished under the Companies Act 2006. 
Each Ordinary Share carries the right to vote at general meetings of 
the Company. The rights and restrictions attaching to the Redeemable 
Preference Shares differ from those attaching to Ordinary Shares  
as follows: 
>  The Redeemable Preference Shares carry no rights to receive 
dividends.
>   The holders of Redeemable Preference Shares have no rights to 
receive notices of, attend or vote at general meetings except in 
certain limited circumstances. They have one vote for every 50,000 
Redeemable Preference Shares held.
>   On a distribution of assets of the Company, on a winding-up or 
other return of capital (subject to certain exceptions), the holders of 
Redeemable Preference Shares have priority over the holders of 
Ordinary Shares to receive the capital paid up on those shares.
>   Subject to the provisions of the Companies Act 2006, the Company 
has the right to redeem the Redeemable Preference Shares at any 
time on giving not less than seven days’ written notice.
There are no specific restrictions on the transfer of shares in the 
Company, which is governed by the Articles and prevailing legislation.
The Company is not aware of any agreements between holders of 
shares that may result in restrictions on the transfer of shares or that 
may result in restrictions on voting rights.
Action necessary to change the rights of shareholders
In order to vary the rights attached to any class of shares, the consent 
in writing of the holders of three quarters in nominal value of the issued 
shares of that class or the sanction of an extraordinary resolution 
passed at a general meeting of such holders is required.
General meetings
AGMs and other general meetings, as from time to time may be 
required, where a special resolution is to be passed or a Director is  
to be appointed, require 21 clear days’ notice to shareholders. Subject 
to the Companies Act 2006, other general meetings require 14 clear 
days’ notice.
For all general meetings, a quorum of two shareholders present in 
person or by proxy, and entitled to vote on the business transacted, 
 is required unless each of the two persons present are corporate 
representatives of the same corporation; or each of the two persons 
present are proxy of the same shareholder.
Shareholders and their duly appointed proxies and corporate 
representatives are entitled to be admitted to general meetings.
Limitations on the rights to own shares
There are no limitations on the rights to own shares.
Property
Substantially all of our properties are held freehold, free of material 
encumbrances and we believe that such properties are fit for their 
purpose.

Important information for readers of this Annual Report
Cautionary statement regarding forward-looking statements
The purpose of this Annual Report is to provide information to the members of the 
Company. The Company and its Directors, employees, agents and advisors do not 
accept or assume responsibility to any other person to whom this Annual Report is 
shown or into whose hands it may come and any such responsibility or liability is 
expressly disclaimed. In order, among other things, to utilise the ‘safe harbour’ 
provisions of the US Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and the UK 
Companies Act 2006, we are providing the following cautionary statement: This 
Annual Report contains certain forward-looking statements with respect to the 
operations, performance and financial condition of the Group. Forward-looking 
statements are statements relating to the future which are based on information 
available at the time such statements are made, including information relating to risks 
and uncertainties. Although we believe that the forward-looking statements in this 
Annual Report are based on reasonable assumptions, the matters discussed in the 
forward-looking statements may be influenced by factors that could cause actual 
outcomes and results to be materially different from those expressed or implied by 
these statements. The forward-looking statements reflect knowledge and information 
available at the date of the preparation of this Annual Report and the Company 
undertakes no obligation to update these forward-looking statements. We identify  
the forward-looking statements by using the words ‘anticipates’, ‘believes’, ‘expects’, 
‘intends’ and similar expressions in such statements. Important factors that could 
cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in forward-looking 
statements, certain of which are beyond our control, include, among other things, 
those factors identified in the Principal risks and uncertainties section from  
page 130 of this Annual Report. Nothing in this Annual Report should be construed  
as a profit forecast.
Inclusion of reported performance, Core financial measures and constant 
exchange rate growth rates
AstraZeneca’s determination of non-GAAP measures together with our presentation 
of them within our financial information may differ from similarly titled non-GAAP 
measures of other companies.
Statements of competitive position, growth rates and sales
In this Annual Report, except as otherwise stated, market information regarding the 
position of our business or products relative to its or their competition is based upon 
published statistical sales data for the 12 months ended 30 September 2011 obtained 
from IMS Health, a leading supplier of statistical data to the pharmaceutical industry. 
For the US, dispensed new or total prescription data and audited sales data are 
taken, respectively, from IMS Health National Prescription Audit and IMS National 
Sales Perspectives for the 12 months ended 31 December 2011; such data is not 
adjusted for Medicaid and similar state rebates. Except as otherwise stated, these 
market share and industry data from IMS Health have been derived by comparing our 
sales revenue to competitors’ and total market sales revenues for that period. Except 
as otherwise stated, growth rates are given at CER. For the purposes of this Annual 
Report, unless otherwise stated, references to the world pharmaceutical market or 
similar phrases are to the 53 countries contained in the IMS Health MIDAS Quantum 
database, which amounted to approximately 96% (in value) of the countries audited 
by IMS Health.
