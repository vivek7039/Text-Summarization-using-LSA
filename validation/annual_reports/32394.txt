03 Castleton Technology plc Annual Report 2017
Dear Shareholder
I am pleased to be able to report on 
another year of solid progress for 
Castleton.  Following the acquisitive 
growth of FY2015 and FY2016, FY2017 
has been a year of consolidation as 
we put in place firm foundations for 
the Group to build on its position as a 
successful niche player in software and 
IT managed services within the public 
sector market place. The acquisition 
of seven small companies brings great 
rewards but also significant integration 
efforts. Despite early teething issues 
previously noted, I’m delighted to say 
that the business has now dealt with 
these and as we enter our fourth year, we 
fully expect the company to demonstrate 
its growth potential.   
With respect to the year under review, 
I am encouraged that we have 
demonstrated our ability to improve 
the mix of sales as the Company has 
successfully transitioned to targeting 
multiyear SaaS software revenues 
whilst continuing to grow our overall 
sales. A key success in the year has 
been clearly demonstrating the highly 
cash generative nature of our business 
model which facilitated a reduction in our 
net debt. 
 
The Board
There have been changes at Board 
level as the Group puts in place our 
foundations for future growth.  
Dean Dickinson joined the Board as 
CEO on 31 October 2016, replacing Ian 
Smith who became Executive Deputy 
Chairman.  Dean was previously 
Managing Director of Advanced 
Business Solutions, part of Advanced 
Computer Software Group Limited 
(previously Advanced Computer 
Software plc (“ ACS”)), where he led the 
impressive growth of the Public Sector 
and Enterprise division following the 
acquisition of COA Solutions in 2010. 
Dean was part of the senior management 
team that sold ACS to Vista Private Equity 
for £725 million in March 2015. 
Caro Bell resigned from the Board as 
Operations Director on 30 August 2016 
having joined in November 2015 and 
Davinder Sanghera resigned from the 
Board as Chief Operations Officer on 
16th January 2017 having joined when 
Documotive was acquired by Castleton 
in November 2014. Davinder was 
appointed as Chief Operations Officer on 
9 April 2015. I would like to thank them 
both for the hard work they have put in 
to help make Castleton the company it 
is today.
Opportunity / Outlook
The year has primarily been one of 
consolidation and we continue to 
see enormous potential to become 
the go-to supplier for software and IT 
services in the social housing market. 
There remain significant cross-selling 
opportunities within the customer base 
in order to provide our customers with 
the technology and services that they 
require. The low penetration of our 
comprehensive product and service set 
across our customer base combined with 
a healthy pipeline of new business gives 
me confidence for the year ahead.
With the team currently in place, a 
broad customer base, a wide range of 
products and services and solid cash 
flows enabling repayment of debt, I am 
confident of our future success and I 
expect that the Group will show further 
growth when it next reports.

05 Castleton Technology plc Annual Report 2017
Overview
I am pleased to report the significant 
progress the Group has made during 
the financial year to 31 March 2017 . 
I arrived at the end of October 2016 with 
the Company having made multiple 
acquisitions in prior years and the start 
of the financial year saw Castleton 
improve the terms of its existing 
exclusive reseller agreement with 365 
Agile Group plc (“ Agile”) granting us 
an exclusive licence for Agile’s suite 
of mobile working software solutions 
in relation to the social housing sector. 
Each of the acquisitions has brought best 
in class software solutions and managed 
services capability, so the foundations for 
a successful and scalable business were 
already in place.
The focus during the year has also 
been on integrating the businesses 
acquired, and since my arrival in October 
2016, I have made further changes to 
the structure and organisation which 
strengthened our platform and which will 
allow the Group to grow and maximise 
the opportunities available in our 
chosen market.  
Our Market and What We Do
The markets in which we operate are 
focused around public sector and 
not-for-profit social housing but also 
include the contractors who provide 
repairs services to the social housing 
providers. Castleton has six offices in the 
UK and a growing operation in Australia, 
demonstrating our ability to grow and 
scale our business in a new geography.
The Group remains aligned along 
two divisions; Software Solutions 
and Managed Services, with each 
focusing on their separate yet 
complementary offerings.  
Our Software Solutions division provides 
all key business processes to social 
landlords covering everything from 
tenant engagement, rent collection, 
financial planning and control, document 
managing and repairs management. 
All key processes are available to be 
utilised on a mobile platform via apps 
or digital engagement. The range of 
solutions provides customers with 
significant improvements in service, 
performance and insight.
Our Managed Services division offers a 
wide range of IT Infrastructure solutions 
which support an organisation’s 
business objectives, including helping 
to drive efficiencies, manage legacy 
architectures or providing customers and 
staff with the latest social, mobile and 
cloud technologies.
Trading Results
Revenue for the year showed an 
increase of 13% to £20.3 million 
(2016: £18 million) with in excess of 60% 
of revenue being recurring in nature 
(2016: 58%). Adjusted EBITDA * showed 
a stronger performance, improving by 
22% to £4.4 million (2016: £3.6 million), 
reflecting the Company’s operational 
gearing and ability to scale profitably. 
The underlying metrics of the business 
were particularly encouraging.  The 
Managed Services division’s trading 
EBITDA ** grew 32% year on year as 
we look to transition to more profitable 
deals.  The Software Solutions division’s 
trading EBITDA ** grew 15%.
Operating cash conversion was 
outstanding at 105% of adjusted EBITDA * 
pre exceptional costs and 86% of 
adjusted EBITDA * post exceptional costs, 
enabling a reduction in net debt*** and, 
pleasingly, earnings per share at a basic 
level were 0.59p, following a loss in the 
previous year of 1.56p per share.
Operational Review
Much of the focus this year has been 
on completing the integration of the 
companies acquired since June 2014, 
which I am pleased to say is largely 
done, and building a platform and 
infrastructure to enable continued 
profitable growth and take full advantage 
of the market opportunity. We have 
made improvements to the quality of the 
business processes, people, structure 
and control. The organic growth of 
the business is building on the back of 
the acquisitive growth. Our contracted 
backlog of revenue has grown by over 
40%, which gives us good forward 
visibility of revenue.   
The increase in revenues was driven 
by the addition of new customers 
and through cross-selling of products 
and services into the Group’s existing 
base. Castleton now supports over 
750 customers and during the year 
the number of those who have two or 
more of our products increased to 35%. 
Not only does this show traction in our 
intention to cross-sell and our customers’ 
confidence in our product suite, but also 
means that 65% of our customer base 
still uses just one product, providing 
a very strong opportunity for further 
organic growth.
*Earnings for the year from continuing operations before net

Chief Executive’s 
Review continued
Castleton is well positioned 
to provide an eco-system 
of integrated modular 
solutions supported by 
scalable infrastructure 
platforms, helping 
organisations to operate 
more effectively and 
achieve their goals,  
whilst bringing visible 
recurring annuity revenues 
to the Group. 
As referred to above, the start of the year, 
in April 2016, saw Castleton improve the 
terms of its existing exclusive reseller 
agreement with Agile by entering into a 
new perpetual licence agreement with 
the company whereby we were granted 
an exclusive licence for their suite of 
mobile working software solutions in 
relation to the social housing sector. 
New contracts signed during the year 
include a landmark agreement with 
Wentworth Community Housing in 
Australia, signed in November 2016, for 
the provision of Kypera’s housing system 
and three other products including 
Agile’s mobile working solutions. 
This followed on from the installation of a 
local management team and is evidence 
of the opportunity available in the 
Australian market and the relevance of 
Castleton’s product suite in that country.
In January this year, two new contracts 
were announced, namely a ten-
year agreement with Clúid Housing 
Association (“Clúid”) in Ireland and a 
five-year contract with Arcon Housing 
Association (“ Arcon”) in Manchester. 
Both agreements were for multiple 
products and / or services, with Clúid 
being the first customer to take the 
complete suite of software products, 
validating the Group’s intention of 
becoming a “one stop shop” serving the 
social housing sector and showing the 
Group’s ability to cross-sell and upsell 
the product suite. Our success in winning 
these new contracts demonstrates the 
unique proposition that Castleton can 
bring to the market and we continue 
to seek to expand on this success by 
increasing the number of customers who 
take multiple products, which is a major 
focus going forwards.  Strategic Report

Financial Statements
07 Castleton Technology plc Annual Report 2017
At the end of the year, the Company had 
further success in signing two multi-
year agreements, extending both the 
contract base and the level of recurring 
revenue. The first is a seven year 
contract with North Hertfordshire Homes 
and the second a three year contract 
with a community regeneration and 
housebuilding company.
Post year end, a new operational 
structure has been put in place with 
clearly aligned objectives and sales 
teams have been tasked with defined 
territories and targets. The initial 
feedback has been positive, both 
internally and from customers.
Outlook
Castleton is well positioned to provide 
an eco-system of integrated modular 
solutions supported by scalable 
infrastructure platforms, helping 
organisations to operate more effectively 
and achieve their goals, whilst bringing 
visible recurring annuity revenues to 
the Group.  The Group brings together 
trusted brands with a pedigree of 
delivering solutions that meet customer 
needs whilst offering a refreshing 
change of culture and approach, 
focusing on customer collaboration using 
modern technology. We see the public 
and not-for-profit sectors as attractive 
markets due to their niche requirements 
and we believe a significant opportunity 
exists to capitalise on the ability to 
address historic under-investment in IT 
infrastructure in those sectors.
I am confident  that the business is 
now in a position to maximise the 
opportunities that we see in our chosen 
markets by offering our customers an 
integrated suite of products, either on an 
installed or cloud delivery basis, in turn 
allowing them to increase efficiencies 
and lower their costs of operating. 
Post year-end we have had a number of 
successes selling our software products 
on a cloud basis. Combined with the 
general long term nature of the contracts 
entered into, selling our products on 
a hosted basis gives greater recurring 
revenue and greater visibility of earnings 
and cash flow as we move forward.  
The new financial year has started 
well and in line with expectations. 
The Company has good visibility of 
revenues, a strong and improving 
product suite combined with a defined 
roadmap for further development, 
and an improved structure to 
enable us to execute our strategy. 
The existing customer base provides a 
significant opportunity for cross-selling 
opportunities, adding further organic 
growth along with new customers. 
The Board continues to view the future 
with confidence.

I am pleased to present this report as 
Chief Financial Officer. 
Principal events and overview
Other than the new licence agreement 
with Agile, further details of which can 
be found below, the period since the last 
report has been one of consolidation 
compared to the previous two years of 
considerable acquisitive activity.  
As with the prior years, there has been 
a considerable amount of integration 
activity, partly contributing to the 
£0.7 million exceptional charge within 
the Income Statement.  Agile’s suite 
of solutions have been merged into 
Castleton Software Solutions Ltd, 
which, along with Castleton Managed 
Services Ltd, form the two divisions in the 
Group.  Also during the year, we merged 
the offices acquired along with the 
acquisition of Impact Applications Limited 
into our Software Solutions headquarters 
in Sutton Coldfield.  With the exception 
of Kypera, all acquired entities are on a 
common accounting platform across the 
Group, which brings a greater degree of 
process and visibility to our back office 
operations.  We plan to bring Kypera onto 
our common accounting platform during 
the current year.
Agile
On 4 April 2016, the Group improved its 
existing exclusive reseller agreement 
with Agile and entered into a new 
perpetual licence agreement whereby 
Castleton was granted an exclusive 
licence for Agile’s suite of mobile working 
software solutions in relation to the social 
housing sector (the “ Agile Licence”).
Agile’s software solutions are 
complementary to Castleton’s range of 
solutions which have been designed 
to enable social housing organisations 
to work more efficiently and effectively. 
Agile’s software solutions allow field 
based and customer facing teams to 
securely access any system, data or 
document from any global location, 
allowing users to complete tasks in 
real time.  
T o continue to support and develop the 
product, a number of staff members 
transferred from Agile to the Group, and 
as a result, the grant of the licence and 
the transfer of staff collectively meet 
the definition of a business combination 
under IFRS3 and consequently are 
recorded as a business combination in 
these accounts.
Under the terms of the Agile Licence, 
Castleton will pay Agile £600,000 per 
year over a three year period with the 
potential for a further payment of at least 
£300,000 in the year to 31 March 2020 
dependent on total sales during the first 
three years of the agreement. 
The Board of Castleton believes that 
the Agile Licence and staff transfer are 
strategically important as they secure 
the Group’s use of Agile’s software 
solutions going forward, whilst enhancing 
the margin, with an estimated payback 
period of two years. 
Goodwill
A fair value reassessment of £0.9m 
was performed on Kypera, the majority 
of which relates to claims in relation 
to onerous contracts that were in 
place prior to acquisition together 
with the associated rectification costs. 
Discussions are currently ongoing; 
however, the resolution of such claims 
remains uncertain.
Trading results
The trading results for the year comprise 
a full year of trading for all entities 
acquired in the prior years and, from 
4 April 2016, a full year of trading from 
the updated Agile Licence
Revenue and gross profit
Revenue amounted to £ 20.3 million 
(2016: £18.0 million), of which £10.8 million 
was generated by the Software 
Solutions division (2016: £8.3 million) 
and £9.4 million (2016: £9.7 million) was 
generated by the Managed Services 
division. Recurring revenue is in excess 
of 60% of total revenues (2016: 58%). 
Gross profit amounted to £14.3 million 
(2016: £11.3 million), representing a gross 
margin of 70% (2016: 63%). The increase 
in overall gross margin is partly due to 
a full year of trading from the Kypera 
business which was acquired in the 
previous year (and sits in the Software 
Solutions division) and has a higher gross 
margin and also as a result of the new 
Agile Licence where there is no longer 
a 70% commission included in cost of 
sales. Gross margin for the Software 
Solutions division increased from 80% 
to 84% and for the Managed Services 
division it increased from 40% to 45%.
Administrative expenses including 
exceptional items
The administrative expenses were 
incurred in the running of all entities, 
and include the cost of the Board 
and its advisors, including the cost of 
occupancy, back office support services, 
and the fees associated with maintaining 
the AIM listing as well as amortisation 
of £3.0 million and exceptional items.  
Exceptional items of £0.7 million 
(2016: £2.2 million) include costs relating 
to restructuring activities undertaken in 
the year.
Adjusted EBITDA *
The adjusted EBITDA for the 
year amounts to £4.4 million 
(2016: £3.6 million). 
The cost in the year for the plc Board 
and its advisors was £1.3 million 
(2016: £1.2 million), and we continue to 
maintain tight controls on expenditure. 
Trading EBITDA was therefore 
£5.7 million (2016: £4.6 million).
Finance income and costs
Finance income represents the interest 
earned on deferred income from the sale 
of the consulting business sold in 2015, 
and finance costs comprise interest 
payable on bank borrowings and the 
interest and unwind of discount on the 
convertible loan notes issued in January 
2016 to part fund the acquisition of 
Kypera (“Loan Notes”). Finance income 
and costs amounted to £0.02 million 
(2016: £0.3 million) and £0.7 million 
(2016: £0.7 million) respectively.

Profit for the year attributable to 
the owners of the parent company
The Group profit for the year to 
31 March 2017 was £0.5 million (2016: 
loss of £1.1 million).  This comprises the 
loss before tax of £0.5 million (2016: 
loss of £1.9 million), which includes 
the finance income of £0.02 million 
(2016: £0.3 million) and a tax credit of 
£1.0 million (2016: £0.8 million) arising 
from R&D tax credits, the unwind of 
deferred tax recognised on intangible 
assets and prior year adjustments.
Cash flow
Cash generated from operations 
during the year was £4.6 million 
(2016: £0.6 million) reflecting a decrease 
in working capital of approximately 
£0.1 million (2016: increase of 
£3.0 million).  
Net of cash acquired, £1.0 million of cash 
was used  in business combinations 
(£0.5 million for Brixx and £0.5 million for 
Agile) which was funded through cash 
generated by the business.
This resulted in an overall increase in 
funds of £0.6 million, giving a net positive 
cash position at the balance sheet date 
of £0.3 million (2016: net negative cash 
position of £0.3 million).   
Deferred income
Deferred income arises where revenue 
is invoiced ahead of delivery of 
performance obligations and therefore 
recognition of revenue. This is common 
in software maintenance, hosting, 
managed services and software 
subscription agreements. Invoicing is 
largely quarterly, half yearly or annually in 
advance and therefore deferred income 
levels fluctuate throughout the year. 
At 31 March 2017 deferred revenue of 
£8.4 million is £0.7 million higher than at 
the end of March 2016 due to growth in 
the above contracts.
Funding and debt repayment
During the year, the Group repaid 
£1.0 million of the Barclays term loan in 
line with the facility agreement.  As at the 
balance sheet date, £4.3 million of term 
loan was outstanding.
In addition, in March 2017 , the Group 
repaid £0.5 million of the £3.5 million 
Loan Notes issued to part fund the 
acquisition of Kypera.  A further 
£0.5 million of the Loan Notes were 
repaid in April 2017 . The Loan Notes are 
capable of being converted into new 
ordinary shares at a price of 85.6 pence 
per ordinary share, which represented a 
5% premium to the mid closing price on 
28 January 2016, the day immediately 
prior to completion of the acquisition of 
Kypera. Conversion is at the option of 
the holder at any time during the five 
year term. 
On 29 May 2016, the final £0.5 million of 
deferred consideration for the acquisition 
of Brixx was paid and also during the 
year, £0.5 million of the £1.8 million due 
under the terms of the Agile Licence 
was paid.
During the year, £0.15 million of the 
£0.45 million of convertible loan notes 
that were issued as part of the acquisition 
of Opus (the “Opus Loan Notes”) were 
converted into shares.  Post year-end, 
the remaining £0.3 million of the Opus 
Loan Notes were cancelled in agreement 
with the holders.   
Going Concern
The Directors have prepared detailed 
cash flow projections including 
sensitivity analysis on key assumptions. 
The Group’s forecasts and projections, 
taking account of reasonably possible 
changes in trading performance and the 
timing of key strategic events, show the 
Group will be able to operate within the 
level and conditions of available funding.  
Based on the funding available, the 
Directors have a reasonable expectation 
that the Group has adequate resources 
to continue in operational existence for 
the foreseeable future. 
Accordingly, the Group continues 
to adopt the going concern basis 
in preparing its consolidated 
financial statements.

Strategic  
Report
The Directors present their strategic 
report for the year ended 31 March 2017 .
Review of the business and future 
developments
A detailed review of the business is set 
out in the Chairman’s Statement and 
in the Chief Executive’s and Financial 
Reviews. Included in these reviews are 
comments on the key performance 
indicators that are used by the Board 
on a monthly basis to monitor and 
assess the performance of the business. 
These indicators include the level 
of turnover, gross profit, gross profit 
percentage, adjusted EBITDA * and costs.
Future developments and current 
trading and prospects are set out in the 
Chairman’s Statement and in the Chief 
Executive’s and Financial reviews. 
These reports together with the 
Corporate Governance Statement, the 
remuneration Committee report and the 
Audit Committee report are incorporated 
into this report by reference and should 
be read as part of this report. 
The Group’s strategy is focused on 
selling multi-year annuity deals across 
its customer base and increasing the 
number of products and services each 
customer takes.
Principal risks and uncertainties
Identifying, evaluating and managing 
the principal risks and uncertainties 
facing the Group is an integral part of the 
way we do business. We have policies 
and procedures in place throughout 
our operations that enable us to do so, 
embedded within our management 
structure and as part of our normal 
operating processes. 
Market and economic conditions are 
recognised as one of the principal risks in 
the current trading environment. This risk 
is mitigated by the monitoring of trading 
conditions and the constant search for 
ways to achieve new efficiencies in the 
businesses without impacting levels 
of service. 
Reliance on key personnel and 
management
The success of the Group will be 
dependent on the services of key 
management and operating personnel. 
The Directors believe that the Group’s 
future success will depend largely on its 
ability to attract and retain highly skilled 
and qualified personnel, and to expand, 
train and manage its employee base. 
There can be no guarantee that suitably 
skilled and qualified individuals will be 
retained or identified and employed. 
If the Group fails to retain or recruit 
the necessary personnel, or if the 
Group loses the services of any of its 
key executives, its business could be 
materially and adversely affected.
Competition risk
The Group operates in a highly 
competitive IT product, software and 
services marketplace and while the 
Directors believe the Group enjoys 
significant strengths and advantages 
in competing for business some of 
the competitors are much larger with 
considerable scale that could allow them 
to offer similar services for materially 
lower prices than the Group could 
match while maintaining a margin in 
the range targeted by the management 
of the Group. Therefore, competitors 
could materially adversely impact both 
the scale of the Group’s revenues and 
its profitability.
Technology
The market for Castleton’s products 
and services is in a state of constant 
innovation and change. The Group 
actively participates in a number of 
industry-wide forums, and devotes 
significant resource to the development 
of new products and services, ensuring 
new technologies can be incorporated 
and integrated with the Group’s 
core services.
Post-acquisition integration risk, and 
risks of an acquisition strategy
The Directors recognise that the Group 
has been very acquisitive over the last 
three years, and that integrating these 
acquisitions and the associated change 
management can take a period of time.  
The Company may not be able to fully 
achieve its strategic objectives and 
operating efficiencies in an acquisition, or 
these may take longer than anticipated. 
Inherent uncertainties exist in integrating

In addition, the markets and industries 
in which the Company and its potential 
acquisition targets operate, are highly 
competitive. The Company may lose 
existing customers or the customers 
of an acquired entity as a result of its 
acquisition. The Company also may 
lose key personnel, either from the 
acquired entity or from itself, as a 
result of an acquisition. These factors 
could contribute to the Company not 
achieving the expected benefits from its 
acquisitions within desired time frames, 
if at all. Future business acquisitions 
could be material to the Company and 
it may issue additional equity to pay 
for those acquisitions, which would 
dilute current shareholders’ ownership 
interest. Acquisitions could also require 
the Company to use substantial cash 
or other liquid assets or to incur debt. 
In such a case, it could become more 
susceptible to economic downturns and 
competitive pressures.

Corporate Governance 
Statement
As an AIM quoted company Castleton is not required to comply with the principles and provisions of the 2012 UK Corporate 
Governance Code. The Directors have decided to adopt the Corporate Governance Code for small and mid-sized quoted 
companies, as published by the Quoted Companies Alliance, and have sought to meet its recommendations in so far as it 
considers them appropriate for a company of Castleton’s size and nature.
The Board of Directors
At the financial year-end the Board comprised the Non-Executive Chairman (David Payne), the Executive Deputy Chairman (Ian 
Smith), the Chief Executive Officer (Dean Dickinson), the Chief Financial Officer (Haywood Chapman) and one Non-Executive 
Director (Phil Kelly). 
Davinder Sanghera, who was appointed to the Board as Chief Operating Officer on 9 April 2015 resigned from the Board on 
16 January 2017 and Caro Bell who was appointed to the Board as Operations Director on 2 November 2015 resigned from the 
Board on 30 August 2016.
The business and management of the Company and its subsidiaries are the collective responsibility of the Board. At each meeting, 
the Board considers and reviews the trading performance of the Group. The Board has a formal written schedule of matters 
reserved for its review and approval. These include the approval of the annual budget, major capital expenditure, investment 
proposals, the interim and annual results, and a review of the overall system of internal control and risk management.
There are three standing Board Committees: Audit, Nominations and Remuneration. Each of these Committees acts within defined 
terms of reference. Additional information is set out later in this report and also in the Directors’ Remuneration Report in respect of 
the Remuneration Committee.
Authority for the execution of the approved policies, business plan and daily running of the business is delegated to the executive 
Directors. During the year, the Board met formally on ten occasions.
Phil Kelly is the Senior Independent Non-Executive Director and has served throughout the year.  
The Company’s Articles of Association require one-third of the Directors to stand for re-election each year at the Annual General 
Meeting and that each Director should seek re-election every 3 years. In addition, Directors appointed by the Board during the 
year must seek re-appointment at the next Annual General Meeting. Accordingly, Dean Dickinson and Phil Kelly will retire and 
offer themselves for re-election at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting.
All Directors have access to the advice and services of the Company Secretary who is responsible for ensuring that Board 
procedures and applicable rules and regulations are observed. The Board has a procedure whereby any Director may seek, 
through the office of the Company Secretary, independent professional advice, at the Company’s expense, in furtherance of his or 
her duties.
Formal agendas and reports are provided to the Board on a timely basis for Board and Committee meetings and the Chairman 
ensures that all Directors are properly briefed on issues to be discussed at Board meetings. Directors are able to obtain further 
advice or seek clarity on issues raised at the meetings from within the Company or from external sources.
All Directors are subject to appraisal by the Board. The non-executive Director is responsible for the evaluation of the Chairman.
Nominations Committee
The Nominations Committee consisted of David Payne (Chairman) and Phil Kelly throughout the year.
For nominations, the Nominations Committee meets as and when necessary to consider the appointment of new executive and 
non-executive Directors.
A process is in place for the appointment of new Directors involving the use of external consultants, where appropriate, followed 
by meetings with both the Nominations Committee and subsequently with the Board as a whole, together with the Company 
Secretary. This ensures that the selection process is both formal and objective. The Nominations Committee has formal terms of 
reference (available on request from the Company Secretary) and meets at least once a year to review succession planning at 
both Board and senior management level across the Group.  During the year, the Nominations Committee met formally on two 
occasions and there were no absences from the meetings.
Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee consisted of David Payne (Chairman) and Phil Kelly throughout the year.  Details of the 
Remuneration Committee and its policies are set out in the Directors’ Remuneration Report.   The Remuneration Committee has 
formal terms of reference (available on request from the Company Secretary).  During the year, the Remuneration Committee met 
formally on three occasions. There were no absences from the formal meetings. 17 Castleton Technology plc Annual Report 2017
Strategic Report
Governance
Financial Statements
Audit Committee
The Audit Committee consisted of Phil Kelly (Chairman) and David Payne throughout the year.
The Audit Committee has formal terms of reference (available on request from the Company Secretary). These include the 
recommendation, appointment, re-appointment and removal of the external auditors, the review of the scope and results of 
the interim review and external annual audit by the auditors, their cost effectiveness, independence and objectivity. The Audit 
Committee also reviews the nature and extent of any non-audit services provided by the external auditors. In addition, the Audit 
Committee reviews the effectiveness of internal controls, considers the need for an internal audit function and considers any major 
accounting issues and reports on such matters to the Board. The Audit Committee reviews the integrity of the financial statements 
and formal announcements. A whistle-blowing arrangement exists whereby matters can be confidentially reported to the Audit 
Committee. The executive Directors are not members of the Audit Committee but attend the meetings by invitation, as necessary, 
to facilitate its business.
The Chief Financial Officer monitors the level and nature of non-audit services and specific assignments are flagged for approval 
by the Audit Committee as appropriate. The Audit Committee reviews non-audit fees and considers implications for the objectivity 
and independence of the relationship with the external auditors.  The Board is satisfied that the Chairman of the Audit Committee 
has recent and relevant financial experience.  The Audit Committee met on three occasions during the year and there were no 
absences from the meetings.
Internal control
The Board has overall responsibility for the Group’s system of internal control and for reviewing its effectiveness. 
The implementation and maintenance of the risk management and internal control systems are the responsibility of the executive 
Directors and senior management. The internal control system is designed to manage risk rather than eliminate it and can 
therefore only provide reasonable and not absolute assurance against material misstatement or loss. The Board confirms that 
there are on-going processes for identifying, evaluating and managing the significant risks faced by the Group. 
The Group is committed to maintaining high standards of business conduct and operates under an established internal control 
framework covering financial, operational and compliance controls. This is achieved through an organisational structure 
that has clear reporting lines and delegated authorities. The reporting lines and delegated authorities are clearly defined. 
Management monitors the risk and performance of the Group. In addition, the Group maintains written processes to control 
expenditure, authorisation limits, purchase ordering, sales order intake, project management, inventories and assets to the extent 
applicable given the changes in the Group’s activities during the year.
The Board receives monthly financial information which includes key performance and risk indicators and the Chief Executive 
Officer reports on significant changes in the business and the external marketplace to the extent they represent significant risk. 
There is an established budgetary system with an annual budget approved by the Board. The Board reviews the results monthly 
against budget and forecasts together with other business measures.
The principal treasury related risks are documented and approved by the Board. Details of financial instruments are set out in 
notes 22 and 23 to the financial statements.
Relations with shareholders and investors
Copies of the Annual Report and Accounts are issued to all shareholders and copies are available on the Group’s website 
www.castletonplc.com. The Half Y ear Report is also available on the Group’s website. The Group makes full use of its website to 
provide information to shareholders and other interested parties. The Company Secretary also deals with a number of written or 
e-mailed enquiries throughout the year.
Shareholders are given the opportunity to raise questions at the Annual General Meeting and the Directors are available both prior 
to and after the meeting for further discussion with shareholders.
During the year, the Executive Deputy Chairman, the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer met with institutional 
investors after the announcement of the interim and year-end results. Additional meetings were arranged during the year by the 
Group’s brokers, finnCap Limited. Feedback arising from these meetings was communicated to the Board and the Company 
Secretary also reported to the Board on feedback from shareholders.
Phil Kelly, as Senior Independent Non-Executive Director, is available to shareholders if they wish to raise any matters that contact 
through the normal channels of Non-Executive Chairman, Executive Deputy Chairman, Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial 
Officer or Company Secretary has failed to resolve or for which such contact is inappropriate.

None of the directors made any gains on exercise of share options in 2017 or 2016. 
a)  On 2 December 2016, EMI Share Options over 416,665 ordinary shares were awarded to Dean Dickinson. The options vest after 
three years at an exercise price of £0.60. On 10 February 2017 options were awarded under a combination of unapproved share 
options and hurdle shares to increase overall options held by Dean Dickinson to 1.4%. 
The 1.4% of options held is evergreen in nature, meaning that the percentage of the fully diluted issued share capital held under option 
will remain constant, notwithstanding any further issues of ordinary shares in the capital of the Company. Within the 1.4% the number 
of EMI Share Options is a fixed number of 416,665. The options are being awarded under a variety of schemes, both approved and 
unapproved.  All of the options are subject to vesting criteria with a compound share price growth rate of 12% per annum over 3 years. 
If the average price of an ordinary share does not reach or exceed the target above, then the options shall lapse. 
Share price
The market price of the Company’s shares on 31 March 2017 was 64.5p per share. The highest and lowest market prices during 
the year were 84.5 pence and 53.0 pence respectively.

Directors’  
Report
The Directors present their report together with the audited financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2017 .

Review of the business and future developments
The review of the year and the directors’ strategy and objectives for the future are set out in the Strategic Report.
Overseas Presence
The company has one overseas business, being Kypera Australia Pty Limited. Income streams originating from this business 
amounted to £353,000 (2016: £38,000).
Research and Development
Castleton’s research and development activities underpin its new Software Solutions offerings. During the year advancement of 
operational integration has resulted in such activity being reliably measured to meet the group’s accounting policy for capitalising 
such costs. Capital expenditure on research and development in the year ended 31 March 2017 amounted to £0.3 million. 
The capitalisation rate was 23%.
Dividends
The Company did not pay a dividend during the year. The Directors do not recommend the payment of a dividend (2016: nil).
Financial instruments
The Group’s financial instruments primarily comprise borrowings, loan notes and cash balances. In addition, various other financial 
instruments such as trade receivables and payables arise directly from its operations. 
T o finance the acquisitions of Brixx and Impact during the prior year, the Group entered a new bank facility on 1 June 2015 with the 
Group’s existing bankers, Barclays Bank Plc, comprising a term loan of £5.0 million together with an overdraft of up to £2.0 million. 
On 1 February 2016, to finance the acquisition of Kypera, the Group extended this loan facility with Barclays by £1 million and 
increased the overdraft by £0.5 million. The loan is repayable at a rate of £250,000 per quarter commencing August 2015 and 
attracts interest of 3.0% above LIBOR. The overdraft is secured on the assets of the group by way of fixed and floating charges.
£0.4 million of convertible loan notes were issued in the year ended 31 March 2016 to satisfy the contingent consideration for 
the acquisition of Opus Information T echnology Limited (“Opus Loan Notes”). The Opus Loan Notes were redeemable in cash or 
convertible into new ordinary shares of 2 pence each in the capital of the Company (“Ordinary Shares”) at a price of 40 pence per 
Ordinary Share in various tranches: £0.15 million on 30 September 2016, £0.15 million on 30 September 2017 and £0.1 million on 
30 September 2018.  On 21 June 2017 , it was agreed by the beneficiaries of the loan notes issued at the time of the Company’s 
acquisition of Opus Information T echnology Limited (“Opus”) that they would waive the remaining £0.25m of loan notes in lieu of 
surrendering any potential warranty claims under the sale and purchase agreement. 
In addition on 29 January 2016, in order to fund the acquisition of Kypera, the Company issued £3.5 million of unsecured loan 
notes (“Kypera Loan Notes”), which have a term of 5 years and carry interest at a rate of 5% per annum, which is not cash paid. 
The Kypera Loan Notes can be converted into new Ordinary Shares at a price of 85.6 pence per Ordinary Share. Conversion is 
at the option of the holder at any time during the 5-year term. The Company can redeem the Kypera Loan Notes from the third 
anniversary of issue if not already converted and earlier by request. In March 2017 , the Group repaid £0.5 million of the £3.5 million 
Kypera Loan Notes and a further £0.5 million of the Loan Notes were repaid in April 2017
Further details of the Group’s risks and policies regarding financial instruments are set out in notes 22 and 23.
Subsequent events
On 27 April, the Group repaid a further £0.5 million of the £3.5 million of unsecured convertible loan notes that were issued on 
29 January 2016 to assist in the funding for the acquisition of Kypera (“Loan Notes”).  This was in addition to the £0.5 million Loan 
Notes repaid on 29 March 2017 .
On 21 June 2017 , it was agreed by the beneficiaries of the loan notes issued at the time of the Company’s acquisition of 
Opus Information T echnology Limited (“Opus”) that they would waive the remaining £0.25m of loan notes in consideration of

Staff policy
The Group’s employment policies are designed to ensure that they meet the statutory, social and market practices in the UK 
where the Group operates. The Group systematically provides employees with information on matters of concern to them, 
consulting them or their representatives regularly, so that their views can be taken into account when making decisions that are 
likely to affect their interests. Employee involvement in the Group is encouraged, as achieving a common awareness on the part 
of all employees of the financial and economic factors affecting the Group plays a major role in maintaining its relationship with 
its staff.
The Group is committed to employment policies, which follow best practice based on equal opportunities for all employees, 
irrespective of sex, race, colour, disability or marital status. The Group gives full and fair consideration to applications for 
employment for disabled persons, having regard to their particular aptitudes and abilities. Appropriate arrangements are made 
for the continued employment and training, career development and promotion of disabled persons employed by the Group. 
If members of staff become disabled the Group continues employment, either in the same or an alternative position, with 
appropriate retraining being given if necessary.

The Directors who were members of the Board at the time of approving the Directors’ Report are listed on page 14. Having made 
enquiries of fellow Directors, each of these Directors confirms that:
• T o the best of each Director’s knowledge and belief, there is no information relevant to the preparation of their report of which 
the Group’s auditors are unaware; and
• Each Director has taken all the steps a Director might reasonably be expected to have taken to be aware of relevant audit 
information and to establish that the Group’s auditors are aware of that information.

Statement of Directors’ 
Responsibilities
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Strategic Report and the Directors’ Report and the financial statements in 
accordance with applicable law and regulations.
Company law requires the Directors to prepare Group and Company financial statements for each financial year. The directors 
are required by the AIM Rules for Companies to prepare the Group financial statements in accordance with International Financial 
Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union, and have elected under company law to prepare the parent 
company financial statements on the same basis. 
The financial statements are required by law and IFRS adopted by the EU to present fairly the financial position of the Group 
and the Company and the financial performance of the Group. The Companies Act 2006 provides in relation to such financial 
statements that references in the relevant part of that Act to financial statements giving a true and fair view are references to their 
achieving a fair presentation.
Under Company law the Directors must not approve the financial statements unless they are satisfied that they give a true and fair 
view of the state of affairs of the Group and the Company and of the profit or loss of the Group for that period.
In preparing each of the Group and Company financial statements, the Directors are required to:
• select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;
• make judgements and accounting estimates that are reasonable and prudent;
• state whether they have been prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union;
• prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Group and the 
Company will continue in business.
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain the Group’s 
and the company’s transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the Group and 
the Company and enable them to ensure that the financial statements comply with the Companies Act 2006. They are also 
responsible for safeguarding the assets of the company and the Group and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention 
and detection of fraud and other irregularities.
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the corporate and financial information included on the 
Company’s website. Legislation in the United Kingdom governing the preparation and dissemination of financial statements may 
differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.

Independent Auditor’s Report to the 
Members of Castleton T echnology plc
Opinion
We have audited the financial statements of Castleton T echnology plc (the ‘parent company’) and its subsidiaries (the ‘group’) 
for the year ended 31 March 2017 which comprise the consolidated statement of comprehensive income, the consolidated and 
parent company balance sheets, the consolidated and parent company statement of changes in equity, the consolidated and 
parent company cash flow statement and notes to the financial statements, including a summary of significant accounting policies. 
The financial reporting framework that has been applied in their preparation is applicable law and International Financial Reporting 
Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union. 
In our opinion the financial statements:
• give a true and fair view of the state of the group’s and of the parent company’s affairs as at 31 March 2017 and of the group’s 
profit for the year then ended;
• have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union; and
• have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006.
Basis for opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK) (ISAs (UK)) and applicable law. 
Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial 
statements section of our report. We are independent of the group in accordance with the ethical requirements that are relevant 
to our audit of the financial statements in the UK, including the FRC’s Ethical Standard as applied to SME listed entities and we 
have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements. We believe that the audit evidence we have 
obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.
Conclusions relating to going concern
We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters in relation to which the ISAs (UK) require us to report to you where:
• the directors’ use of the going concern basis of accounting in the preparation of the financial statements is not appropriate; or
• the directors have not disclosed in the financial statements any identified material uncertainties that may cast significant doubt 
about the group’s or the parent company’s ability to continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting for a period of at 
least twelve months from the date when the financial statements are authorised for issue.
Key audit matters
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the financial 
statements of the current period and include the most significant assessed risks of material misstatement (whether or not due to 
fraud) we identified, including those which had the greatest effect on the overall audit strategy, the allocation of resources in the 
audit and directing the efforts of the engagement team. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial 
statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.
Revenue recognition
The group generates a number of different revenue streams from its customers, a number of which have different recognition 
criteria. There is a risk that that the revenue recognition policy may not have been correctly applied to contracts in the 
following instances:
• Where there are contracts with multiple components (‘bundled contracts’) the appropriate fair value allocation of consideration 
to each element may not have been applied due to the level of judgement involved; and
• Recognition of software revenue over a period when immediate recognition is appropriate, or vice versa.
Our response to the risk included:
• Assessment of whether revenue has been recognised in line with the Group’s  revenue recognition policies, and IAS 18;
• Performance of substantive analytical review by revenue stream to assess unexpected trends and patterns that could be 
indicative of incorrect revenue recognition;
• Recalculation of the revenue recognised on a sample of contracts, corroborating the details to the underlying contracts. 
In respect of bundled contracts we tested the individual components of a sample of contracts to ensure that the revenue was 
appropriately allocated to the components and that the substance of the contract was appropriately reflected;
• Performance of tests of detail of a sample of accrued revenue and deferred revenue items to ensure the items are in 
accordance with the revenue recognition policy; and
• Cut-off testing for a sample of revenue items recorded either side of the year end to ensure that revenue was recognised in the 
period, if the contract was signed both by Castleton and the customer, and the software or service had been delivered to the 
customer before the year end.
There were no key observations in respect of this risk. 24 Castleton Technology plc Annual Report 2017
Independent Auditor’s Report to the 
Members of Castleton T echnology plc continued
Carrying value of intangible assets
The group has significant intangible assets arising from recent acquisitions and has carried out re-organisations of the businesses 
acquired to integrate the group’s activities.
The combining of activities and the restructurings carried out may give rise to difficulties in carrying out an impairment review as it 
may be more difficult to identify the performance of the original cash generating units.
The inherent uncertainty involved in forecasting future cash flows which form the basis of the recoverability assessment and the 
subjectivity of the key assumptions in impairment models make this one of the key judgment areas on which we will focus our 
audit work
Our response to the risk included:
• Examining management’s assessment as to whether indicators of impairment have been identified and appropriately evaluated;
• Checking that intangible assets have been allocated or re-allocated to appropriate cash generating units;
• Challenging the  discounted cash flow  impairment models used to support the carrying values of intangible assets 
and goodwill;
• Challenging the key assumptions used in the forecasts such as projected growth, future capital expenditure, inflation, cost 
projections and the discount rate;
• Checking the group’s historical forecasting accuracy by comparing the forecast for the year ending 31 March 2017 to the 
actual outturn;
• Challenging management’s sensitivity analyses of the key assumptions and discount rates;
• Comparing  the carrying values of the cash generating units in total  against the Group’s market capitalisation; and
• Determining the adequacy of disclosures of sensitivity and key risks inherent in the calculations.
There were no key observations in respect of this risk.
Our application of materiality
When establishing our overall audit strategy, we set certain thresholds which help us to determine the nature, timing and extent 
of our audit procedures and to evaluate the effects of misstatements, both individually and on the financial statements as a whole. 
During planning we determined a magnitude of uncorrected misstatements that we judge would be material for the financial 
statements as a whole (FSM). During planning FSM was calculated as £334,000, which was not changed during the course of our 
audit. We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to them all unadjusted differences in excess of £8,350 as well as 
differences below those thresholds that, in our view, warranted reporting on qualitative grounds. 
An overview of the scope of our audit
The Group has fifteen components, of which eight are non-trading or dormant. Of the remaining seven components, six were 
subject to full scope audits by RSM UK Audit LLP . One small component was subject to specific procedures which principally 
consisted of desktop review of management figures.
The components subject to full scope audits accounted for 98% of group turnover and 96% of group net assets.
The audit was scoped to support our audit opinion on the group and company financial statements of Castleton T echnology plc 
and was based on group materiality and an assessment of risk at group level. The procedures described above in the key audit 
matters section were applied to all of the six full scope audit components, where applicable.
Other information
The directors are responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the information included in the annual 
report, other than the financial statements and our auditor’s report thereon. Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover 
the other information and, except to the extent otherwise explicitly stated in our report, we do not express any form of assurance 
conclusion thereon. 
In connection with our audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider 
whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit or 
otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If we identify such material inconsistencies or apparent material misstatements, 
we are required to determine whether there is a material misstatement in the financial statements or a material misstatement of 
the other information. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other 
information we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard. 25 Castleton Technology plc Annual Report 2017

Financial Statements
Opinions on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006
In our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of the audit:
• the information given in the Strategic Report and the Directors’ Report for the financial year for which the financial statements 
are prepared is consistent with the financial statements; and
• the Strategic Report and the Directors’ Report have been prepared in accordance with applicable legal requirements.
Matters on which we are required to report by exception
In the light of the knowledge and understanding of the group and the parent company and its environment obtained in the course 
of the audit, we have not identified material misstatements in the Strategic Report or the Directors’ Report.
We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters in relation to which the Companies Act 2006 requires us to report to 
you if, in our opinion:
• adequate accounting records have not been kept by the parent company, or returns adequate for our audit have not been 
received from branches not visited by us; or
• the parent company financial statements are not in agreement with the accounting records and returns; or
• certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration specified by law are not made; or
• we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit.
Responsibilities of directors
As explained more fully in the directors’ responsibilities statement set out on page 22, the directors are responsible for the 
preparation of the financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view, and for such internal control as 
the directors determine is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, 
whether due to fraud or error.
In preparing the financial statements, the directors are responsible for assessing the group’s and the parent company’s ability to 
continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of 
accounting unless the directors either intend to liquidate the group or the parent company or to cease operations, or have no 
realistic alternative but to do so.
Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material 
misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance 
is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs (UK) will always detect a 
material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or 
in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these 
financial statements.
A further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements is located on the Financial Reporting Council’s 
website at: http://www.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities. This description forms part of our auditor’s report.
This report is made solely to the company’s members, as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 
2006.  Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the company’s members those matters we are required to 
state to them in an auditor’s report and for no other purpose.  T o the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume 
responsibility to anyone other than the company and the company’s members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for 
the opinions we have formed.

 (b) Merger reserve
The merger reserve arose from the acquisition of Redstone Communications Limited (£216,000) and Maxima Holdings Limited 
(formerly Maxima Holdings plc) (£7 ,750,000) and represents the difference between the value of the shares acquired (nominal 
value plus related share premium) and the nominal value of the shares issued.
(c)  Conversion of loan notes
On 8 July 2016, the company issued 250,000 new ordinary shares of 2 pence each (“Ordinary Shares”) at a price of 40 pence 
pursuant to the conversion of loan notes issued as part of the previous acquisition of Opus Information T echnology Limited. 
The vendors have undertaken not to sell or otherwise dispose of their interests in the new Ordinary Shares at any time during the 
12 months following the admission of the new Ordinary Shares to trading on AIM.
On 4 October 2016, the company issued a further 375,000 new Ordinary Shares at a price of 40 pence pursuant to the conversion 
of loan notes issued as part of the previous acquisition of Opus Information T echnology Limited. The vendors have undertaken not 
to sell or otherwise dispose of their interests in the new Ordinary Shares at any time during the 12 months following the admission 
of the new Ordinary Shares to trading on AIM. 29 Castleton Technology plc Annual Report 2017

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements
year ended 31 March 2017
1 Accounting policies – Group
Castleton T echnology plc (Castleton) is a public limited company incorporated and domiciled in England and Wales, whose shares 
are publicly traded on AIM, the market of that name operated by the London Stock Exchange. The registered office is 100 Fetter 
Lane, London, EC4A 1BN and the principal place of business is the United Kingdom. The principal accounting policies, which have 
been applied consistently in the preparation of these consolidated financial statements throughout the year and by all subsidiary 
companies, are set out below:
1. 1 Basis of preparation
The consolidated financial statements of Castleton have been prepared on the going concern basis and in accordance with EU 
adopted International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), IFRIC interpretations and the provisions of the Companies Act 2006 
applicable to companies reporting under IFRS. The consolidated financial statements have been prepared under the historical 
cost convention, as modified by the revaluation of financial assets and financial liabilities (including derivative financial instruments) 
at fair value through profit or loss.
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires the use of certain critical accounting estimates. It also 
requires management to exercise its judgement in the process of applying the Group’s accounting policies. The areas involving a 
higher degree of judgement or complexity, or areas where assumptions and estimates are significant to the consolidated financial 
statements are disclosed in Section 1.28 in the accounting policies.
New standards adopted in the year are discussed in Section 1.27 .
Going Concern
The Directors have prepared detailed cash flow projections including sensitivity analysis on key assumptions. The Group’s 
forecasts and projections show the Group will be able to operate within the level and conditions of available funding.  Based on 
the performance for the year and the funding available, the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group has adequate 
resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future. 
Accordingly, the Group continues to adopt the going concern basis in preparing its consolidated financial statements.
1.2 Basis of consolidation
Subsidiaries are all entities (including special purpose entities) over which the Group has control. The group controls an entity 
when the group is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect 
those returns through its power over the entity. Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to 
the group. 
The Group applies the acquisition method to account for business combinations. The consideration transferred for the acquisition 
of a business is the total of the fair values of the assets transferred, the liabilities incurred to the former owners of the acquiree and 
the equity interests issued by the Group. The consideration transferred includes the fair value of any asset or liability resulting from 
a contingent consideration arrangement. Identifiable assets acquired and liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed in a business 
combination are measured initially at their fair values at the acquisition date. The Group recognises any non-controlling interest in 
the acquiree on an acquisition-by-acquisition basis, either at fair value or at the non-controlling interest’s proportionate share of the 
recognised amounts of the acquiree’s identifiable net assets.
Acquisition-related costs are expensed as incurred.
Any contingent consideration to be transferred by the Group is recognised at fair value at the acquisition date. 
Subsequent changes to the fair value of contingent consideration classified as a liability is recognised in accordance with IAS 39 
either in profit or loss or as a change to other comprehensive income. Contingent consideration that is classified as equity is not 
re-measured, and its subsequent settlement is accounted for within equity. Inter-company transactions, balances and unrealised 
gains or losses on transactions between Group companies are eliminated. Accounting policies of subsidiaries have been changed 
where necessary to ensure consistency with the policies adopted by the Group.
1.3 Intangible assets
Goodwill
Goodwill is initially measured as the excess of the aggregate of the consideration transferred and the fair value of any non-
controlling interest over the fair value of the net identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination. 
If this consideration is lower than the fair value of the net assets of the business acquired, the difference is recognised in profit 
or loss.
Following initial recognition, goodwill is measured at cost less any accumulated impairment losses. 
The carrying amount of goodwill allocated to a cash generating unit is taken into account when determining the gain or loss on 
disposal of the unit, or of an operation within it. Goodwill disposed of in this circumstance is measured on the basis of the relative 
values of the operation disposed of and the portion of the cash generating unit retained. 31 Castleton Technology plc Annual Report 2017
Strategic Report
Governance
Financial Statements
1 Accounting policies – Group continued
Software and customer relationships
Intangible assets that meet the criteria to be separately recognised as part of a business combination are carried at cost (which 
is equal to their fair value at the date of acquisition) less accumulated amortisation and impairment losses. An intangible asset 
acquired as part of a business combination is recognised separately if the asset is separable or arises from contractual or other 
legal rights and its fair value can be measured reliably. Intangible assets acquired in this manner include software and customers 
relationships. They are amortised over their estimated useful lives on a straight line basis as follows:
– Software – 7–15 years
– Customer contracts and related relationships – 7–15 years
Impairment and amortisation charges are included within the administrative expenses line in the income statement.
Capitalisation of development costs
Costs directly attributable to the development of software are capitalised as intangible assets only when technical feasibility of the 
project is demonstrated, the Group has an intention and ability to complete and use the software and the costs can be measured 
reliably as per IAS 38. Such costs include internal labour costs of employees directly involved in the project with research costs 
being recognised as an expense when incurred.
Upgrade of software
Upgrades are specifically referred to in customer contracts which state the Company will make Patches and Upgrades available 
to Customers. Customers have a contractual right to these upgrades within a reasonable time after their publication. Upgrades are 
defined as an incremental modification or enhancement software release, in object code form, containing new enhancements, 
features or functionalities, and may be a consolidation of one or more Patches. They do not constitute a fundamental change in 
the software. As the costs occur regularly over the course of the contract they are recognised and written off to the profit and loss 
account as incurred
1.4 Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and any impairment in value. The cost includes 
the original price of the asset and the cost attributable to bringing the asset to its current working condition for its intended use. 
Depreciation is calculated on a straight-line basis on the cost of the asset less residual value over the estimated useful life of the 
asset which is reviewed on an annual basis, as follows
Short leasehold improvements     5 years or over lease term
Network infrastructure     1–5 years
Equipment, fixtures and fittings    2–5 years
An item of property, plant and equipment is de-recognised upon disposal or when no future economic benefits are expected 
to arise from the continued use of the asset. Any gain or loss arising on de-recognition of the asset (calculated as the difference 
between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the item) is included in the income statement in the year the item is 
de-recognised.
1.5 Impairment of assets
Goodwill is not subject to amortisation and is reviewed for impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes in 
circumstances indicate that the carrying value may be impaired. As at the acquisition date any goodwill acquired is allocated to 
each of the cash generating units expected to benefit from the business combination’s synergies. Impairment is determined by 
assessing the recoverable amount of the cash generating unit to which the goodwill relates. When the recoverable amount of the 
cash generating unit is less than the carrying amount, including goodwill, an impairment loss is recognised.
Other intangible assets and property, plant and equipment are subject to amortisation and depreciation and are reviewed for 
impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying values may not be recoverable. In addition, the 
carrying value of capitalised development expenditure is reviewed for impairment annually. If any such indication exists and 
where the carrying values exceed the estimated recoverable amount, the assets or cash generating units are written down to their 
recoverable amount.
The recoverable amount of intangible assets and property, plant and equipment is the greater of fair value less costs to sell 
and value in use. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-
tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset. For an 
asset that does not generate largely independent cash inflows, the recoverable amount is determined by the cash generating 
unit to which the asset belongs. Fair value less costs to sell is, where known, based on actual sales price net of costs incurred in 
completing the disposal.
Non-financial assets that were impaired in previous periods are reviewed annually to assess whether the impairment is 
still relevant.  32 Castleton Technology plc Annual Report 2017
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued
year ended 31 March 2017
1 Accounting policies – Group continued
1.6 Share capital
Ordinary shares and redeemable preference shares are classified as equity. The redeemable preference shares are classified as 
equity as the option to redeem lies with the company. Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares or options 
are shown in equity as a deduction from proceeds.
Share warrants that are issued outside of the scope of IFRS 2 are measured at fair value at date of Issue. They are classified as 
equity instruments based on the substance of the contractual arrangements entered into whereby a fixed amount of cash will be 
received for a fixed number of the Company’s own equity instruments.
1.7 Leases
Where the group has substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of property, plant and equipment, the assets are 
capitalised as property, plant and equipment and depreciated over the shorter of their useful economic life and the lease term. 
The resulting lease obligations are included in borrowings net of finance charges. Interest costs on finance leases are charged to 
the income statement so as to produce a constant periodic rate of charge on the remaining balance of the liability for each period.
Leases where the lessor retains substantially all the risks and benefits of ownership of the asset are classified as operating leases.
Operating lease payments are recognised as an expense in the income statement on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
1.8 Current and deferred income tax
Current tax assets and liabilities are measured at the amount expected to be recovered from or paid to the taxation authorities, 
based on tax rates and laws that are enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred income tax is provided for on all temporary differences at the balance sheet date between the tax bases of assets and 
liabilities and their carrying amounts for financial reporting purposes, with the following exceptions:
• where the temporary difference arises from the initial recognition of goodwill or an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a 
business combination that at the time of the transaction affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss;
• in respect of taxable temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, where the timing of the reversal of the 
temporary differences can be controlled and it is probable that the temporary differences will not reverse in the foreseeable 
future; and
• deferred income tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against 
which deductible temporary differences carried forward, tax credits or tax losses can be utilised.
1.9 Trade and other receivables
Trade and other receivables are recognised and carried at the lower of their original value and recoverable amounts. Provision is 
made where there is evidence that the balances will not be recovered in full. Significant financial difficulties of the debtor, 
probability that the debtor will enter bankruptcy or financial reorganisation, and default or delinquency in payments are considered 
indicators that the trade receivable is impaired. The amount of the provision is the difference between the asset’s carrying amount 
and the present value of estimated future cash flows.
The Group’s trade and other receivables are non-interest bearing.
1. 10 Inventories
Inventories comprise goods for re-sale and are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
1. 11 Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents in the balance sheet comprise cash at bank and in hand and short-term deposits with an original 
maturity of three months or less.
For the purpose of the consolidated cash flow statement, cash and cash equivalents consist of cash and cash equivalents as 
defined above, net of outstanding bank overdrafts.
1. 12 Foreign currencies
The functional and presentation currency of Castleton is Pounds Sterling (£) and the Group conducts the majority of its business 
in Sterling.
Transactions in foreign currencies are initially recorded in the functional currency by applying the rate of exchange ruling at 
the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the functional 
currency rate of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date. All differences are taken to the income statement.
1. 13 Provisions
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past event, it is probable 
that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation, and a reliable estimate can be 
made of the amount of the obligation. 33 Castleton Technology plc Annual Report 2017
Strategic Report
Governance
Financial Statements
1 Accounting policies – Group continued
If the effect of the time value of money is material, provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at 
a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and, where appropriate, the risks specific to 
the liability.
1. 14 Pensions
The Group operates a number of defined contribution schemes. Pension costs are charged directly to the income statement 
in the period to which they relate on an accruals basis. The Group has no further payment obligations once contributions have 
been paid.
1. 15 Share-based payment transactions
The cost of equity-settled transactions with employees is measured by reference to the fair value of the award at the date at 
which they are granted and is recognised as an expense over the vesting period, which ends on the date at which the relevant 
employees become fully entitled to the award. Fair value is determined by an external valuer using an appropriate pricing model 
for which the assumptions are approved by the Directors. In valuing equity-settled transactions, only vesting conditions linked to 
the market price of the shares of the Company are considered.
No expense is recognised for awards that do not ultimately vest, except for awards where vesting is conditional upon a market 
condition, which are treated as vesting irrespective of whether or not the market condition is satisfied, provided that all other 
performance conditions are satisfied.
At each balance sheet date before vesting, the cumulative expense is calculated, representing the extent to which the vesting 
period has expired and management’s best estimate of the achievement or otherwise of non-market conditions, number of equity 
instruments that will ultimately vest or in the case of an instrument subject to a market condition, be treated as vesting described 
above. The movement in the cumulative expense since the previous balance sheet date is recognised in the income statement, 
with a corresponding entry in equity.
Where the terms of an equity-settled award are modified or a new award is designated as replacing a cancelled or settled award, 
the existing charge is recognised immediately. In addition, an expense is recognised over the remainder of the new vesting period 
for the incremental fair value of any modification, based on the difference between the fair value of the original award and the 
fair value of the modified award, both as measured on the date of the modification. No reduction is recognised if this difference 
is negative.
Where an equity-settled award is cancelled, it is treated as if it had vested on the date of cancellation, and any expense not yet 
recognised for the award is recognised immediately. Any compensation paid up to the fair value of the award at the cancellation 
or settlement date is deducted from equity, with any excess over fair value being treated as an expense in the income statement.
1. 16 Accrual for employee benefits, including holiday pay 
Provision is made for employee benefits, including holiday pay, to the extent of the liability if all employees of the Group had left 
the business at its reporting date.
1. 17 Financial assets
The Group classifies its financial assets as loans and receivables.
Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments which are not quoted in an active 
market. They are included in current assets, except for maturities greater than 12 months after the balance sheet date which are 
classified as non-current assets. The Group’s loans and receivables comprise ‘trade and other receivables’ and ‘cash and cash 
equivalents’ on the balance sheet.
1. 18 Compound financial instruments
Compound financial instruments issued by the group comprise convertible notes that can be converted to share capital at the 
option of the holder, and the number of shares to be issued does not vary with changes in their fair value.
The liability component of a compound financial instrument is recognised initially at the fair value of a similar liability that does 
not have an equity conversion option. The equity component is recognised initially at the difference between the fair value of the 
compound financial instrument as a whole and the fair value of the liability component. Any directly attributable transaction costs 
are allocated to the liability and equity components in proportion to their initial carrying amounts.
Subsequent to initial recognition, the liability component of a compound financial instrument is measured at amortised cost using 
the effective interest method. The equity component of a compound financial instrument is not re-measured subsequent to initial 
recognition except on conversion or expiry.
1. 19 Interest-bearing loans and borrowings
All loans and borrowings are initially recognised at fair value less directly attributable transaction costs. After initial recognition, 
interest-bearing loans and borrowings are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.  34 Castleton Technology plc Annual Report 2017
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued
year ended 31 March 2017
1 Accounting policies – Group continued
Gains and losses arising on the repurchase, settlement or otherwise cancellation of liabilities are recognised in the finance cost 
line in the income statement.
Borrowings are classified as current liabilities unless the group has an unconditional right to defer settlement of the liability for at 
least 12 months after the end of the reporting period.
1.20 Trade and other payables
Trade payables are initially recognised at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective 
interest method. 
1.21 Finance costs
Loans are carried at fair value on initial recognition, net of unamortised issue costs of debt. These costs are amortised over the 
loan term. Where a significant change occurs in respect of a loan, any unamortised issue costs arising from previous issues of debt 
are recognised in the income statement in full.
All other borrowing costs are recognised in the income statement on an accruals basis, using the effective rate method.
1.22 Revenue
Revenue comprises the fair value of the consideration received or receivable for the sale of goods and services in the ordinary 
course of the group’s activities. Revenue is shown net of Value Added T ax, returns, rebates and discounts and after eliminating 
sales within the group.
The group recognises revenue when the amount of revenue can be reliably measured, it is probable that future economic 
benefits will flow to the entity and when specific criteria have been met for each of the group’s activities as described below. 
The amount is not considered to be reliably measurable until all contingencies relating to the sale have been resolved. The group 
bases its estimates on historical results taking into account the type of customer, the type of transaction and the specifics of 
each arrangement.
(i) Sale of software licences
The group sells licences to use its software products either on a perpetual royalty free basis or on a rental basis for a fixed 
period of time. Revenue arising from the sale of perpetual licences is recognised at the time of sale provided that all the Group’s 
obligations associated with the sale of the licence have been fulfilled.  Revenue from licences sold on a rental or subscription basis 
is recognised over the period for which the Group has obligations under the contract. Amounts billed to customers in advance of 
revenue recognition are shown as deferred income. 
(ii) Sales of services 
The group sells consultancy, training, implementation and project management services to customers either separately from or 
in conjunction with the sale of licences. Revenue from the sale of services is recognised over the period in which the service has 
been provided. Where services are not invoiced as incurred, revenue is accrued or deferred as necessary. Amounts billed to 
customers in advance of revenue recognition are shown as deferred income.
(iii) Sales of goods
Sales of goods are recognised at the point that risks and rewards of ownership are transferred. This is usually on delivery.
(iv) Maintenance, support and managed services
The group enters into contracts to provide these services on an annually, quarterly or other periodic  basis. Revenue from such 
agreements is recognised in equal instalments over the period of the agreements.
Amounts billed to customers in advance of revenue recognition are shown as deferred revenue. 
Revenue is deferred in respect of the following four income streams: 
(i)  Software licence fees (non-perpetual) where the revenue is spread over the term of the licence. Invoicing is usually in advance 
of revenue recognition; 
(ii)  support maintenance and managed services the income from which is spread over the length of the service period. This is 
usually billed for either a quarter or the whole year in advance; 
(iii)  services which may give rise to deferred revenue where the customer is invoiced in advance for consultancy, training, 
implementation and project management services; and 
(iv)  subscriptions where the revenue is spread over the period to which the subscription relates. This is usually billed for either a 
quarter or the whole year in advance. 35 Castleton Technology plc Annual Report 2017

Bundled contracts
When products are bundled together before being sold to the customer, it is necessary to apply the recognition criteria to the 
separately identifiable components of a single transaction in order to reflect the substance of the transaction. The associated 
revenue is allocated between the constituent parts of the bundle on a relative fair value basis. The Group has a systematic basis 
for allocating relative fair values in these situations. When customers are offered discounts on bundled products and/or services, 
the combined discount is allocated to the relative constituent elements of the bundle, based upon internal price lists. 
1.23 Finance income
Income is recognised on an accrual basis using the effective interest method.
1.24 Exceptional items
Items which are material either because of their size or their nature, are highlighted separately on the face of the income 
statement. The separate reporting of exceptional items helps provide a better picture of the Group’s underlying performance. 
Items which may be included within the exceptional category include:
• acquisition costs
• spend on the integration of significant acquisitions and other major restructuring programmes; 
• significant goodwill or other asset impairments; and 
• other particularly significant or unusual items.
Spend on integration is incurred by the Group when integrating one trading business into another. The types of costs include 
employment related costs of staff made redundant as a consequence of integration, due diligence costs, property costs such as 
lease termination penalties and vacant property provisions, third party advisor and consultant fees and rebranding costs.
Exceptional items are excluded from the headline profit measures used by the Group and are highlighted separately in the 
income statement as management believe that they need to be considered separately to gain an understanding of the underlying 
profitability of the trading businesses. 
1.25 Operating profit or loss
The operating profit or loss is identified in the income statement and represents the profit on activities before finance income and 
costs and taxation.
1.26 Segmental reporting
The Chief Operating Decision Maker has been identified as the Executive Board. The Executive Board reviews the Group’s internal 
reporting in order to assess performance and allocate resources. Management has determined the operating segments based on 
these reports.
The Executive Board assess the performance of the operating segments based on adjusted EBITDA. Information provided to the 
Executive Board is measured in a manner consistent with that in the Financial Statements.
1.27 Application of new IFRSs and interpretations 
There were no significant new financial reporting standards adopted in the year ended 31 March 2017 . The following standards 
and interpretations, which are not yet effective and not yet endorsed by the EU and have not been early adopted by the Group, 
will be adopted in future accounting periods:
– International Financial Reporting Standard (IFRS) 15 ‘Revenue from contracts with customers’ (effective 1 January 2018)
– International Financial Reporting Standard (IFRS) 9 ‘Financial instruments’ (effective 1 January 2018)
– International Financial Reporting Standard (IFRS) 16 ‘Leases’ (effective 1 January 2019)
IFRS 15
IFRS 15 (Revenue from contracts with customers) will be effective for Castleton T echnology Plc for the period starting 1 April 2018. 
There are no plans to adopt IFRS 15 early. The standard permits two possible transition methods: 1) retrospectively to each prior 
period presented or 2) retrospectively with the cumulative effect of initially applying the standard recognised on the date of initial 
application. The transition method to be adopted by Castleton is currently being considered.
We have identified differences between our current accounting policies and the future IFRS 15 based policies (as far as these have 
already been developed). Based on our analyses so far, these differences include:
• We expect a revised revenue pattern for on-premise subscription contracts, which combine the delivery of software and support 
service. Under our current policies we recognise the subscription amount rateably over the subscription term. In contrast under 
IFRS 15 we would recognise the portion of the transaction price allocated to licence throughout the implementation period only 
at the outset of the arrangement. 36 Castleton Technology plc Annual Report 2017
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued
year ended 31 March 2017
1 Accounting policies – Group continued
• Based on the nature of our software and the complexity of implementation we expect to combine the provision of a licence and 
its implementation into one performance obligation.
• We do not currently capitalise the cost of obtaining a contract. We expect the capitalisation amount to increase under IFRS 
15 due to a broader definition of what is capitalisable as cost to obtain a contract. We expect to match the amortisation of 
capitalised costs to obtain a contract to the revenue recognised but will use the practical expedient of IFRS 15 to not capitalise 
costs that relate to revenue that will be recognised within 12 months.
As a practical expedient and as allowed under the standard we will apply the five step approach under IFRS 15 to portfolios of 
contracts which have similar characteristics and where we expect that the financial statements would not differ materially had the 
standard been applied to the individual contract within the portfolio.
Although it is expected that the standard will have an impact on the timing and amount of revenue and costs being recognised 
there will be no impact on cash flows with cash collections remaining in line with contractual terms.
The quantitative impact of IFRS 15 on our 2019 financial statements is currently neither known to us nor reasonably estimable.
We will continue to assess the impact that the application of IFRS 15 will have in the period of initial application, which will also 
depend on our commercial strategy.
IFRS 16
The new IFRS 16 standard covering the accounting of leases will replace IAS 17 and associated interpretations. It introduces a 
standard accounting model for lessees. As a result lessees are obliged to recognise assets and liabilities for all leases unless the 
term is less than 12 months or the underlying asset has a low value. The lessee recognises an asset reflecting its right to use the 
underlying leased object. It also recognises a lease liability reflecting its obligation to make lease payment. The impact of IFRS 16 
on Castleton is being assessed. The main impact is expected to be around property leases of which the company currently has 7 . 
IFRS 9
The Introduction of IFRS 9 is not expected to have a material Impact on the results of the Group. 
1.28 Critical accounting estimates and judgements
(a) Critical accounting estimates
Estimates and judgements are continually evaluated and are based on historical experience and other factors, including 
expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.
The Group makes estimates and assumptions concerning the future. The resulting accounting estimates will, by definition, seldom 
equal the related results. The estimates and assumptions that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the 
carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year are:
• Provisions 
Where the directors believe a customer claim or complaint will probably give rise to a liability, provision is made for the directors’ 
best estimate of the eventual cost. The outcome in each case cannot be predicted with certainty and the cost may be more or less 
than the amount provided. See note 20 for details of provisions. 
• Estimated valuation of intangibles 
On acquisition of a new business, the Group identifies intangible assets. This calculation involves estimates about future revenues, 
costs, cash flows and the cost of capital for the Group. It also involves estimating royalty rates used in the valuation model for 
software acquired in business combinations, and the estimated life of customer relationships.
• Estimated impairment of goodwill and intangible assets
The Group tests annually whether goodwill and intangible assets have suffered any impairment, in accordance with the 
accounting policy stated in 1.5. The recoverable amounts of cash generating units have been determined based on value-in-use 
calculations. These calculations require the use of estimates. No reasonably possible changes in assumptions would cause an 
impairment charge.
• Estimated valuation of financial instruments
Convertible loan notes and share warrants are valued based on the following definition of fair value per IFRS 13 ‘Fair Value 
Measurement’: ‘the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between 
market participants at the measurement date’. These calculations require the use of estimates. External experts have been 
engaged for valuation purposes where appropriate. If the discount rate used was 10% lower or 10% higher than the rate used the 
effect would increase or decrease the value of the liability by 4%. 37 Castleton Technology plc Annual Report 2017

 (b) Critical judgements in applying accounting policies
• Revenue recognition
The directors exercise judgement in relation to the amounts of revenue and deferred income to be recognised on 
bundled contracts.
• Classification of exceptional costs
The Directors have exercised judgement when classifying certain costs as integration and strategic costs. They believe that these 
costs are all related to the costs described in note 1.24. 
• Estimated impairment of irrecoverable trade receivables. 
The directors have exercised judgement in assessing the recoverability of trade debts and the amount which may need to 
be provided.
• Contingent consideration
The directors have exercised judgement in assessing the fair value of contingent consideration payable for acquisitions. 
They believe forecasts used give sufficiently accurate information to make a reasonable assessment of the fair value of 
such liabilities.
• Business combinations
In accounting for business combinations the directors have exercised judgement in assessing the valuation of intangibles and the 
associated estimates about future revenues, costs, cash flows and the cost of capital for the Group.
2 Segment reporting

6 Business Combinations
Agile
On 4 April 2016, the Group improved its existing exclusive reseller agreement with 365 Agile Group plc (“ Agile”) and entered into a 
new perpetual licence agreement with Agile whereby Castleton has been granted an exclusive licence for Agile’s suite of mobile 
working software solutions in relation to the social housing sector.  
T o continue to support and develop the product, a number of staff members transferred from Agile to the Group, and as a result 
the grant of the licence and the transfer of staff collectively meet the definition of a business combination under IFRS3 and 
consequently are recorded as a business combination in these accounts. 
Castleton will pay Agile consideration of £1.8 million payable over three years, with a contingent element payable depending on 
total revenue in the first three years of the agreement.  
From the date of acquisition to 31 March 2017 , Agile recorded revenue of £0.7 million and a profit before taxation of £0.2 million 
compared to profit before taxation of £0.2 million under the previous arrangement. The recorded revenue for the period 1 April 
2016 to 3 April 2016 was £2,645 with a profit of £611. 
The total goodwill, representing synergies expected to accrue to the enlarged group and the knowledge and ability of the 
workforce, and intangible assets arising from the business combinations is the difference between the fair value of consideration 
less the fair value of assets acquired, as set out below.

Cash consideration is payable over three years for a value of £1.8 million, of which £0.5 million has been paid to date. 
Further contingent consideration of £0.3 million is payable if revenue from the software of £2.2 million is generated by 4 April 2019. 
Further contingent consideration will be paid at 50% of the revenue that exceeds the £2.2 million threshold. If the conditions are 
met the amounts payable are due to be paid within 90 days of 4 April 2019. 
On acquisition the Directors assessed the business acquired to identify any intangible assets. Intellectual property met the criteria 
for recognition as intangible assets as it is separable and has a measurable fair value, being the amount for which an asset would 
be exchanged between knowledgeable and willing parties in an arm’s length transaction. 
For the intellectual property the fair value of the intangible assets was calculated by using the discounted cash flows arising from 
the revenue forecast. 
A long term growth rate of 2.0% was applied with a discount rate of 9.9%. The reasonable economic life of the intellectual property 
was assumed to be 15 years. 41 Castleton Technology plc Annual Report 2017

The assessment of the fair values of the assets and liabilities on acquisition has been completed. A fair value adjustment to 
goodwill was made in relation to an onerous contract provision which existed at the date of acquisition of £0.752 million which 
related to a customer claim and the associated rectification costs. 
A further fair value adjustment of £0.16 million was made upon review of the acquisition balance sheet. 
Impact
A fair value adjustment in relation to accrued costs was also created of £43,000.

short-term temporary differences £0.1 million (2016: £0.1 million) and tax losses of £5.9 million (2016: £8.8 million). Deferred tax 
assets have not been recognised in respect of losses and reliefs where it is the view of the Directors that it is not certain that future 
taxable profits of the nature required will be available to offset against any deferred tax asset. 43 Castleton Technology plc Annual Report 2017

10 Earnings/loss per share
Basic earnings/loss per share and diluted earnings/loss per share are calculated using a weighted average number of shares of 
78,339,832 and 86,215,879 respectively (March 2016: weighted average number of shares of 72,265,145 and 80,345,997).

The weighted number of shares and the loss for the year ended 31 March 2016 for the purposes of calculating the fully diluted 
earnings per share are the same as the basic loss per share calculation. This is because the outstanding share options and 
warrants would have the effect of reducing the loss per ordinary share and would, therefore, not be dilutive under the terms of 
IAS 33.

Goodwill is reviewed for impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying 
value may be impaired Goodwill is supported by calculating the discounted cash flows arising from the existing businesses. A long 
term growth rate of 2.0 percent was applied with a discount rate of 9.9 percent. 
Impairment tests for goodwill
The recoverable amount of all cash generating units (CGU) has been determined based on value-in-use calculations. 
These calculations use pre-tax cash flow projections based on financial budgets approved by management until 31 March 2018. 
Cash flows beyond this period are extrapolated using the estimated growth rates stated below. 
For each of the CGUs with a significant amount of goodwill the key assumptions in addition to long term growth rate and discount 
rate used in the value-in-use calculations are as follows:
Managed Services
Gross margin   – 44 percent
Operating margin   – 31 percent
Software Solutions
Gross margin   – 90 percent
Operating margin   – 32 percent
For all cash generating units the long term growth rate assumed is 2.0%. The pre-tax discount rate used is 9.9%, which reflects 
management’s risk-adjusted estimate of the weighted average cost of capital. 
A reasonably possible adverse movement in any of the above key assumptions made would not give rise to impairment.

The carrying value of trade receivables that would otherwise be past due or impaired but whose terms were renegotiated 
were £nil. The individually impaired receivables relate to receivables over 182 days, customers in financial difficulty, customer 
acceptance issues and cancelled contracts.
As at 31 March 2017 , trade receivables of £1.9 million were past due but not impaired (2016: £2.9 million). In the table below, these 
comprise the receivables over 30 days, which relate to a number of independent customers for whom there is no recent history of 
default. The ageing analysis of net trade receivables which are past due and not impaired is as follows:

The provision is calculated by central management with local knowledge on a specific basis based on their best estimate of 
recoverability taking into account the age and specific circumstances relating to the debtor. The maximum exposure to credit 
risk at the reporting date is the fair value of each class of receivable mentioned above. The Group does not hold any collateral as 
security. The carrying amounts of the Group’s trade and other receivables are denominated in pounds.

£0.4 million of convertible loan notes were issued in the year ended 31 March 2016 to satisfy the contingent consideration for 
the acquisition of Opus Information T echnology Limited (“Opus Loan Notes”). The Opus Loan Notes were redeemable in cash or 
convertible into new ordinary shares of 2 pence each in the capital of the Company (“Ordinary Shares”) at a price of 40 pence per 
Ordinary Share in various tranches: £0.15 million on 30 September 2016, £0.15 million on 30 September 2017 and £0.1 million on 
30 September 2018. On 21 June 2017 , it was agreed by the beneficiaries of the loan notes issued at the time of the Company’s 
acquisition of Opus Information T echnology Limited (“Opus”) that they would waive the remaining £0.25m of loan notes in 
consideration of surrendering any potential warranty claims under the sale and purchase agreement. 
On 8 July 2016, the company issued 250,000 new Ordinary Shares pursuant to the conversion of loan notes issued as part of the 
previous acquisition of Opus Information T echnology Limited. A further 375,000 Ordinary shares pursuant to the conversion of 
loan notes were issued on 4 October 2016, all in part settlement of the balance. 
The Noteholder can convert the loan note at any time given sufficient notice is provided per the agreement. Interest is accrued on 
the compounding amount at 5% per annum.
In addition on 31 January 2016, in order to fund the acquisition of Kypera, the Company issued £3.5 million of unsecured loan 
notes (“Kypera Loan Notes”), which have a term of 5 years and carry interest at a rate of 5% per annum, which is rolled up into 
the loan. The Kypera Loan Notes can be converted into new Ordinary Shares at a price of 85.6 pence per Ordinary Share. 
Conversion is at the option of the holder at any time during the 5 year term. The Company can redeem the Kypera Loan Notes 
from the third anniversary of issue if not already converted and earlier by request. 
On 31 March 2017 £0.5 million of the Kypera Loan Notes were repaid. A further repayment of £0.5 million was made on 27 April 
2017 in respect of the Kypera Loan Notes. 48 Castleton Technology plc Annual Report 2017

Castleton will pay Agile consideration of £1.8 million payable over four years, with a contingent element payable depending on 
total revenue in the first three years of the agreement.  The Group believes that this is strategically important, as it secures the 
use of the Agile product going forward whilst enabling Castleton to keep 100% of the revenue associated with sales thereof 
by the Group, compared to having a 70% commission payable to Agile under the previous agreement. Cash consideration is 
payable over four years for a value of £1.8 million, of which £0.5 million has been paid to date. Further contingent consideration 
of £0.3 million is payable if revenue from the software of £2.2 million is generated by 4 April 2019. A further contingent fee will be 
paid at 50% of the revenue that exceeds the £2.2 million threshold. If the conditions are met the amounts payable are due to be 
paid within 90 days of 4 April 2019.  The balance shown as due after more than one year includes the unwinding of the discount 
on deferred consideration.
On 26 January 2017 the Group entered into individual agreements with the former owners of Keylogic  to ensure that neither 
individual is able to compete with the company or a Group Company in the sale of hosted desktop services to a Social Housing

Property 
The Group currently has one vacant property. A provision has been recognised to cover the rent, business rates and service 
charges for the period the property is expected to be vacant, being up to the lease expiry. Provisions are calculated using the 
contracted rates of rents and service charges on the individual lease arrangement. Dilapidation provisions are built up over the life 
of the associated lease based on estimates of costs of work required to fulfil the Group’s contractual obligation under the lease 
agreements to return the property to the same condition as at the commencement of the lease.

As is usual practice in corporate transactions, the Company has given warranties and indemnities in relation to businesses 
disposed of. The directors have not received any claims under such warranties or indemnities, and have no reason to believe 
that there will be any sustainable claims forthcoming over the remaining period of 2 years. No provision has been made for any 
potential claims in these financial statements.

minimise adverse effects of fluctuations in the financial markets on the value of the Group’s financial assets and liabilities, on

The Group’s principal financial instruments for financing are bank borrowings, overdraft facilities and loans. The Group has various 
other financial instruments such as cash, trade receivables and trade payables that arise directly from its operations.

23 Financial risk management 
The Group’s activities expose it to a variety of financial risks: market risk (including foreign exchange, fair value interest rate risk, 
cash flow interest rate risk, and price risk), credit risk, and liquidity risk. The Group’s overall risk management programme focuses 
on the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to minimise potential adverse effects on the Group’s financial performance.
Risk management is carried out centrally under policies approved by the Board of Directors. Management identifies, evaluates 
and hedges financial risks. The Board provides principles for overall risk management, as well as policies covering specific areas, 
such as foreign exchange risk, interest rate risk, credit risk, use of derivative financial instruments and non-derivative financial 
instruments, and investments of excess liquidity.
(a) Market risk
(i) Foreign exchange risk
The Group mainly operates within the UK and foreign exchange risk arises from future commercial transactions, recognised assets 
and liabilities.
(ii) Interest rate risk
The Group receives interest on cash and cash equivalents and pays interest on its borrowings.
The impact on post-tax profit and equity of a +/– 1% shift in the interest rate would not be material. 
(iii) Price risk
The Group is not exposed to significant commodity or security price risk.
(b) Credit risk
Credit risk is managed at a central level. Credit risk arises from cash and cash equivalents, derivative financial instruments and 
deposits with banks and financial institutions, as well as credit exposures to customers, including outstanding receivables, and 
committed transactions. Individual risk limits are set based on internal and external ratings and review by the Board where 
appropriate. The utilisation of credit limits is regularly monitored with appropriate action taken by management in the event of a 
breach of credit limit.
(c) Liquidity risk
Management reviews cash forecasts of the operating companies of the Group. The Group’s liquidity management policy involves 
projecting cash flows and considering the level of liquid assets necessary to meet these.
The table below analyses the Group’s financial liabilities into relevant maturity groupings based on the remaining period from the 
balance sheet date to the contractual maturity date. These amounts disclosed in the table are the contracted undiscounted cash 
flows. Balances within 12 months equal their carrying balances as the impact of discounting is not significant. 51 Castleton Technology plc Annual Report 2017

25 Share-based payment plans continued
The terms of the current plans are as follows:
Employee Shareholder Scheme (“ESS”)
The ESS was established in July 2015 and this discretionary scheme permits the grant of options to all eligible employees of the 
group. The options are exercisable within ten years from date of grant.
Employee Management Incentive scheme (“EMI”)
The EMI was established in July 2015 and this discretionary scheme permits the grant of options to all eligible employees of the 
group. The options are exercisable between three and ten years from date of grant.
Unapproved scheme
The Unapproved scheme was established in July 2015 and this discretionary scheme permits the grant of options to all eligible 
employees of the group. The options are exercisable within ten years from date of grant.
All of the above options are subject to vesting criteria with a compound share price growth rate of 12% per annum over 3 years. 
MXC Share Option Scheme
The MXC Share Option Scheme was established in July 2015 when 5% of the fully diluted share capital was awarded to MXC 
Capital Limited (“MXC”), a company in which Ian Smith is a substantial shareholder. The MXC options are subject to criteria 
whereby the average price per Ordinary Share must exceed 50 pence for 50% of the options to vest and 60 pence for the other 
50% of the options to vest, both criteria for a 10 day period between the second and fifth anniversaries of 1 April 2015.  
All of the Options are evergreen, meaning that the percentage of the fully diluted issued share capital held under option will 
remain constant, notwithstanding any further issues of ordinary shares in the capital of the Company. The options are being 
awarded under a variety of schemes, both approved and unapproved.  The following table illustrates the number and weighted 
average exercise prices (WAEP) of, and movements in, share options during the year.

Lapsed in the year (1,467,199) 58.33p
Outstanding at the end of the year 8,523,133 30.90p 
There were no options exercisable at the end of the year (2016:nil).
The range of exercise prices for options outstanding at the end of the year was 22p to 75.5p (2016: 0p to 75.5p). 
The fair value of the equity-settled share options granted is estimated as at the date of grant using an average of Black-Scholes 
and an empirical model to take into account market conditions attaching to the options. Key inputs to the model were:
Volatility: 19%-68%
Risk free rate: 0.5%
Expected  life: 6 years
Expected dividend: nil 54 Castleton Technology plc Annual Report 2017

Notes to the Company Financial Statements
year ended 31 March 2017
1 Accounting policies 
Castleton T echnology Plc has taken advantage of the exemption provided under Section 408 of the Companies Act 2006 not 
to disclose the Company profit and loss account. The profit made by the Company in the year was £624,000 (2016: loss of 
£8,846,000).
The principal accounting policies, which have been applied consistently throughout the year in the preparation of the financial 
statements, are the same as those of the Group except that the Company has no policy on consolidation and as set out below. 
(a) Basis of preparation
The financial statements of the Company have been prepared on the going concern basis and in accordance with EU adopted 
International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), IFRIC interpretations and the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies 
reporting under IFRS. The consolidated financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention, as modified 
by the revaluation of financial assets and financial liabilities (including derivative financial instruments) at fair value through profit 
or loss.
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires the use of certain critical accounting estimates and these 
are consistent with these of the Group disclosed in note 1.28 to the consolidated financial statements. 
(c) Investments in subsidiaries
Investments are initially recognised at cost, being the fair value of the consideration given and including acquisition costs 
associated with the investment. The carrying value of investments is reviewed for impairment if events or changes in 
circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable.

directors believe that carrying value of the investments is supported by their underlying net assets and cash flows.    
A list of the company’s subsidiaries is set out in note 28 to the consolidated financial statements.

On 31 January 2016, Barclays extended the facility by a further £1 million, which increased the payment terms by 12 months.
6 Convertible loan notes
On 31 January 2016, in order to fund the acquisition of Kypera, the Company issued £3.5 million of unsecured loan notes (“Kypera 
Loan Notes”), which have a term of 5 years and carry interest at a rate of 5% per annum. The Kypera Loan Notes can be converted 
into new ordinary shares of 2 pence each at a price of 85.6 pence per Ordinary Share. Conversion is at the option of the holder 
at any time during the 5 year term. The Company can redeem the Kypera Loan Notes from the third anniversary of issue if not 
already converted.
The Kypera Loan Notes are valued on a Black Scholes option pricing model under standard option pricing assumptions. The fair 
value of the Kypera Loan Notes was calculated as follows:

11 Financial risk management
The Company’s activities expose it to liquidity risk. The Company’s overall risk management programme focuses on the 
unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to minimise potential adverse effects on the Company’s financial performance. 
Risk management is carried out centrally under policies approved by the Board of Directors. Management identifies, evaluates 
and hedges financial risks. The Board provides principles for overall risk management, as well as policies covering specific areas, 
such as interest rate risks.
Liquidity risk
Management reviews cash forecasts of operating companies of the Company in accordance with practice and limits set by the 
Company. The Company’s liquidity management policy involves projecting cash flows and considering the level of liquid assets 
necessary to meet these.
The table below analyses the Company’s financial liabilities into relevant maturity groupings based on the remaining period from 
the balance sheet date to the contractual maturity date. These amounts disclosed in the table are the contracted undiscounted 
cash flows including interest. Balances within 12 months equal their carrying balances plus interest as the impact of discounting is 
not significant.
