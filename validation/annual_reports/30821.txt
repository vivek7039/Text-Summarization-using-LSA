The Unite Group PLC Annual report and accounts 2017 Creating a Home for Success for our students 
is what drives us. Creating the best home for 
all students, helping them grow and succeed 
at University and beyond. 
We deliver this through having quality people, 
quality service and quality properties, and 
behaving in line with our values.
Quality homes
We use our unique insight and experience to deliver quality, secure 
homes where students can develop academically and socially. 
Going to University is an exciting time, but the big changes moving to 
University brings can be stressful. We design our homes and services to 
ensure the transition from home to University is as smooth as possible.  
Our research shows that students that feel well integrated into their new 
environment are better equipped to manage the changes University 
brings and get the most from it.
For all students…
We understand not everyone is the same and University experience is 
unique. We create an environment where everyone can be at home and 
make the choices that are right for them. Social integration is a key focus 
of our property and service design. 
We offer a variety of accommodation at different price points and 
with different payment options enabling students to choose the right 
accommodation for them. We also support the Unite Foundation, which 
provides accommodation scholarships to young people who have been 
in care or are estranged from their families.
Helping them grow 
and succeed…
University is where young people build the foundation of the future 
they want. We believe we have an important role in helping 
them achieve this. 
The interpersonal and self-management skills honed at University provide 
a critical bridge to adulthood. We believe employability is important and 
work to provide our students with the tools for a successful future. We aim 
to create a safe and secure environment that is both caring and 
supportive, but allows our students to develop their independence.
At University and beyond…
We believe that where a student lives has a material impact on their 
academic and social experience of University, and ultimately, their lives. 
Through our people, our service and our properties, we are constantly 
looking for new and better ways to support students to become well-
equipped adults, ready for life after University. We regularly measure  
how well we are meeting student needs through customer surveys and 
focus groups.

DEMAND FOR UK HIGHER 
EDUCATION REMAINS STRONG
MARKET DRIVERS
Student numbers 
continue to outstrip 
accommodation supply.
With more young people choosing to 
continue their education and investment 
in themselves, there has been a 35-year 
period of growing student numbers 
throughout the country. Today there 
are more than 1.8 million students 
studying in the UK. 
Most UK Universities offer an 
accommodation guarantee for 
first year and international students, 
but even this is a challenge with current 
beds available. UK Higher Education 
institutions have c.300,000 beds 
available, with a further 280,000 
provided by the private sector. 
Demand for student accommodation 
significantly outstrips supply. Many 
Universities have responded to this by 
partnering with private accommodation 
providers, most notably through 
nominations agreements under which 
they make up their accommodation 
shortfall by reserving rooms in return 
for a guaranteed rent. 
Unite’s business is focused on addressing 
the demand for student accommodation. 
In doing so, we aim to provide our University 
partners and students with much-needed 
certainty and a living environment that 
helps some 50,000 students get the best 
out of their time at University.

There has been some speculation that 
changes in national demographics, 
combined with rising tuition fees and the 
UK’s decision to leave the EU, could lead 
to a decline in student numbers and, by 
implication, a reduction in demand for 
accommodation. 
However, data from the Universities and 
Colleges Admission Service (UCAS) shows 
that applications for 2018 from the EU rose 
by 3.4% and those from international 
students rose by 1 1.1%, to a record level. The 
combination of robust EU and international 
demand, growth in post-graduates and 
more 18-year-olds going to University has 
ensured that UK higher education remains 
a thriving, vibrant sector. 
Most significantly, the number of students 
choosing mid- and higher-tariff Universities, 
where Unite’s business is concentrated, 
increased while the numbers at lower-tariff 
institutions fell by 3 per cent in 2017 . As a 
result, in most cities where we operate, 
there remains a substantial shortage of 
student accommodation. 
A number of factors are likely to further 
underpin this demand in the future. Higher 
costs lead to a growing focus on the 
relative value that different Universities 
offer. Driving greater transparency and 
accountability will, for example, be a key 
priority for the newly established Office for 
Students, as under the government’s new 
Teaching Excellence Framework, in June 
2017 Universities in England and Wales 
were ranked for the first time according 
to the quality of their teaching.
These developments are likely to bring 
an even greater level of scrutiny among 
applicants. Against this backdrop, 
Universities increasingly consider their 
accommodation guarantee as a key 
point of competitive differentiation. It 
is a core element of providing support 
and welfare to students as it is where 
they spend more than half their time 
while at University. Some are looking to 
extend it to second and third year and 
all international students. 
In many cases, they are increasingly 
looking at established accommodation 
providers as long-term partners with, 
for example, extended nominations 
agreements or strategic partnerships 
involving their own student housing estate.
In parallel with these developments, 
changes beyond the world of higher 
education are also having an impact on 
student accommodation. The combination 
of an uncertain macro-economic climate, 
low interest rates and dramatic changes in 
the world of retail has brought uncertainty 
to the UK’s wider property sector. In some 
cases, this has created opportunities 
for providers of purpose-built student 
accommodation (PBSA), such as Unite, to 
expand in locations like London where the 
property boom of recent years has made 
investing economically challenging. The 
success of PBSA, meanwhile, has attracted 
significant new investment to the sector 
and, in some cities, increased competition. 
Our continued investment in our portfolio, 
ensuring we have the right properties, in 
the right places, and aligned with high 
quality Universities, means we are well-
placed for growth. 
Strategic report Corporate governance Financial statements Other information 03
THE UNITE GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 In a competitive and changing market, Unite’s business 
model and future strategy are focused on leveraging a 
unique combination of assets and capabilities to provide 
homes for students in the locations where they are most 
needed. We call this combination Home for Success. It aims 
to drive advocacy among both students and our University 
partners, as well as long term earnings and capital 
growth for our shareholders.
BUSINESS MODEL AND STRATEGY
Thanks to our long experience in 
the student accommodation market, 
Unite has unrivalled understanding of 
what matters most to students. We use 
this insight to deliver buildings and 
services focused on their needs. Our 
understanding of student preferences 
represents an important competitive 
advantage, continually refreshed by 
investing in new research into different 
aspects of student living.
Since opening our first building in 1991, 
Unite has built the UK’s largest portfolio of 
student accommodation. We continuously 
work to align this portfolio with mid- and 
upper-tier Universities, where demand for 
higher education is greatest. Over 85 per 
cent of our buildings are currently aligned 
with such institutions. 
A strong balance sheet, together 
with our investment in the Unite Student 
Accommodation Fund (USAF) and the 
London Student Accommodation Joint 
Venture (LSAV) give the company a 
flexible range of options for funding 
development, investment and future-
funded property acquisitions. 
We constantly review opportunities to 
enhance both the size and quality of our 
property portfolio. In 2017 , for example, 
the company made acquisitions totalling 
3,500 new beds in strategically important 
cities, while disposing of 4,800 beds in less 
attractive locations.
We will continue to exploit our 
understanding of the market and flexible 
capital structure to continue growing the 
size and quality of our portfolio in cities 
where the demand for PBSA is greatest.
Quality 
properties
Our buildings are located close to 
University campuses and designed 
around the priorities of mainstream 
students. The majority of our buildings, for 
example, are arranged in the preferred 
format of clusters of en-suite bedrooms 
with shared kitchens and living areas. 
Importantly, all our buildings also have 
common recreational and study spaces 
where students can socialise and work.
Our future strategy involves using our 
insight to continue improving the design 
and specification of our properties to 
make sure they keep in step with 
changing student priorities.
  Read more about 
Our properties on p36
Quality 
people
We aim to create an environment that 
is supportive but allows students the 
independence they want. For example, 
all our people receive training in customer 
service and active listening and work 
closely with Universities to ensure help is 
on hand if needed. We are, in addition, 
currently rolling out a programme 
of Student Ambassadors to provide 
additional peer-to-peer support for 
our residents. We are proud to be a 
Living Wage employer, and retain our 
Investors in People Gold accreditation. 
Quality service 
platform
By combining our student insight 
with sustained investment in back 
office systems, value-added services 
and our 1,400 employees, we have 
created a scalable operating platform 
that drives operational efficiency, 
ensures consistency and enhances 
our customers’ experience.
Our rents include all household bills, 
contents insurance and high speed Wi-Fi. 
Digitalising routine tasks such as room 
bookings and payments has made key 
administrative processes simpler and easier 
for students while simultaneously driving 
down costs. New app-based services allow 
students to meet their flatmates online 
before arriving at University and to quickly 
report any issues once checked in.
We will continue to differentiate 
our student proposition and brand 
by investing in value-added services 
for students. We are, in particular, 
continuously considering how we can 
further exploit our digital capability to 
make the vital transition to University as 
smooth as possible and make students’ 
day-to-day lives easier.
  Read more about  
Our service platform and people on 
p08 and p32
In the cities where we operate, we 
aim to be the partner of choice for 
Universities seeking to optimise their 
accommodation strategy.
Quality University 
partnerships
Our annual survey of University decision-
makers shows that our investment in 
relationships has driven our reputation 
within the sector to a record high. As a 
result, 60 per cent of our accommodation 
is currently allocated to students under 
University nominations agreements. We 
are working to increase the maturity profile 
of these agreements and, in the process, 
underpin sustainable earnings growth. 
Nearly 70 per cent of our nominated beds 
are now covered by multi-year contracted 
agreements with occupancy and rental 
growth commitments.
As Universities work to underwrite their 
long-term accommodation requirements, 
we are increasingly focused on identifying 
opportunities for deeper partnerships 
involving either the transfer of existing 
assets or new developments built explicitly 
based on a University’s commitment to a 
long-term nominations agreement.

Quality University partnerships on p10
Through the combination of the UK’s 
best portfolio of student accommodation, 
the best service platform and the strongest 
University relationships, Unite aims to 
reinforce its position as the strongest brand 
in the PBSA sector. We aim to outperform 
our competitors and generate sustainable 
long-term earnings growth coupled to 
capital appreciation, driving superior 
total returns for our shareholders.

THROUGH ENGAGEMENT
UNDERSTANDING OUR STAKEHOLDERS
Why it’s 
important to 
engage
Investors
We seek to provide 
balanced, clear and 
transparent communications 
that allow investors to better 
understand our business and 
our strategy, and how we 
deliver long-term shareholder 
value through earnings and 
capital growth. 
Universities
We aim to be the partner 
of choice to mid and high-
ranking Universities. It is important 
Universities understand how our 
Home for Success purpose aligns 
with their own ambitions for their 
students. Quality properties, 
in great locations with great 
service are an asset to 
Universities and can make 
their offer more attractive. 
Students
Creating a Home for Success 
for our students is our purpose. 
We engage with the students 
who live with us every day. 
Students need to know we 
understand their needs, and 
that our unique insight is being 
leveraged to provide them with 
a living environment that helps 
them get the best out of their 
time at University.
Employees
Our people are the heart of our student 
proposition and engagement with all 
our stakeholders. From our emergency 
contact centre on hand 24/7 in times 
of crisis and for lockouts, to our student 
ambassadors there to help students 
settle in to their new home, together we 
deliver a Home for Success. 
Communities
We operate in 24 cities across the UK, 
providing a home for around 50,000 
students. Providing a home for our 
students means playing a part in the local 
community, whether that’s through being 
responsible neighbours or giving 
something back through volunteering 
and charity work. We also engage with 
local communities around the planning 
and building of new properties. 
Suppliers
Unite Students utilises technology 
and supplier relationships to be at 
the forefront of our sector. With the right 
third parties in place, we can deliver 
quality properties and service, while 
driving efficiency.
Stakeholder 
interests
We hold regular meetings, 
Capital Markets Days, 
results briefings and trading 
updates with institutional 
shareholders, equity analysts 
and investors. All reports and 
presentations are available 
on our website. 
Universities trust us to provide 
a safe and secure home for 
students – a key element 
of students’ experience at 
University, supporting personal 
and academic achievement.
Through the Unite Foundation 
we work with 28 Universities 
to provide scholarships for a 
safe and secure home for 170 
students. Working together, 
we can create better futures 
for our students. 
Our unique insight allows us to 
deliver products and services 
our students need. Our My Unite 
app helps students connect to 
flatmates and services such as 
laundry. With all-inclusive bills 
and 24/7 maintenance and 
support services, we help our 
students focus on their studies. 
We want them to feel at home 
with uS. We also strive to do 
what is right by supporting the 
Unite Foundation, which 
provides accommodation 
scholarships to young people 
who have been in care or are 
estranged from their families.
Our values guide us to deliver a 
strong internal culture focused on high 
performance, operational efficiency 
and engagement. We strive to be a 
responsible and attractive employer, 
proud of our high retention rates and 
career development. We are committed 
to fostering a diverse and inclusive 
workforce. We are a Living Wage employer 
and hold Investors in People Gold status.
We support those who need it, 
whether that be raising £272,000 for 
the British Heart Foundation, or through 
employee volunteering on away days. 
We pioneer new ways to work with 
non-profit and charity partners to build 
stronger local relationships. We consider 
community needs in the development of 
new buildings, for example by prohibiting 
cars on site or adding retail facilities 
to a planning proposal. 
A rigorous tender process ensures 
our partners share our corporate 
commitment to excellence, innovation 
and responsible business practices. 
We take a leading role in industry 
developments.
Relevance to 
the business 
model and 
strategy
Investors are a key source 
of efficient capital, enabling 
the business to invest 
and grow. 
We continue to grow 
the proportion of beds let 
through long-term nominations 
agreements with Universities, 
underpinning security 
of earnings.
We strive for the best customer 
experience for our students, 
delivered by having the best 
people, the best service and 
the best properties. 
Our people are the key to our service-
focused business, delivering for both our 
customers and our University partners. 
Employing and training the best people 
enables us to provide great customer 
service and operational efficiency. 
We work hard to grow and develop local 
relationships, ensuring our students and 
employees have a positive impact on 
communities in which we operate. 
Working with the right partners ensures we 
are able to drive efficiencies and improve 
margins, from both an operational and 
development perspective while 
delivering consistently high quality 
and innovation.

important to 
engage
Investors
We seek to provide 
balanced, clear and 
transparent communications 
that allow investors to better 
understand our business and 
our strategy, and how we 
deliver long-term shareholder 
value through earnings and 
capital growth. 
Universities
We aim to be the partner 
of choice to mid and high-
ranking Universities. It is important 
Universities understand how our 
Home for Success purpose aligns 
with their own ambitions for their 
students. Quality properties, 
in great locations with great 
service are an asset to 
Universities and can make 
their offer more attractive. 
Students
Creating a Home for Success 
for our students is our purpose. 
We engage with the students 
who live with us every day. 
Students need to know we 
understand their needs, and 
that our unique insight is being 
leveraged to provide them with 
a living environment that helps 
them get the best out of their 
time at University.
Employees
Our people are the heart of our student 
proposition and engagement with all 
our stakeholders. From our emergency 
contact centre on hand 24/7 in times 
of crisis and for lockouts, to our student 
ambassadors there to help students 
settle in to their new home, together we 
deliver a Home for Success. 
Communities
We operate in 24 cities across the UK, 
providing a home for around 50,000 
students. Providing a home for our 
students means playing a part in the local 
community, whether that’s through being 
responsible neighbours or giving 
something back through volunteering 
and charity work. We also engage with 
local communities around the planning 
and building of new properties. 
Suppliers
Unite Students utilises technology 
and supplier relationships to be at 
the forefront of our sector. With the right 
third parties in place, we can deliver 
quality properties and service, while 
driving efficiency.
Stakeholder 
interests
We hold regular meetings, 
Capital Markets Days, 
results briefings and trading 
updates with institutional 
shareholders, equity analysts 
and investors. All reports and 
presentations are available 
on our website. 
Universities trust us to provide 
a safe and secure home for 
students – a key element 
of students’ experience at 
University, supporting personal 
and academic achievement.
Through the Unite Foundation 
we work with 28 Universities 
to provide scholarships for a 
safe and secure home for 170 
students. Working together, 
we can create better futures 
for our students. 
Our unique insight allows us to 
deliver products and services 
our students need. Our My Unite 
app helps students connect to 
flatmates and services such as 
laundry. With all-inclusive bills 
and 24/7 maintenance and 
support services, we help our 
students focus on their studies. 
We want them to feel at home 
with uS. We also strive to do 
what is right by supporting the 
Unite Foundation, which 
provides accommodation 
scholarships to young people 
who have been in care or are 
estranged from their families.
Our values guide us to deliver a 
strong internal culture focused on high 
performance, operational efficiency 
and engagement. We strive to be a 
responsible and attractive employer, 
proud of our high retention rates and 
career development. We are committed 
to fostering a diverse and inclusive 
workforce. We are a Living Wage employer 
and hold Investors in People Gold status.
We support those who need it, 
whether that be raising £272,000 for 
the British Heart Foundation, or through 
employee volunteering on away days. 
We pioneer new ways to work with 
non-profit and charity partners to build 
stronger local relationships. We consider 
community needs in the development of 
new buildings, for example by prohibiting 
cars on site or adding retail facilities 
to a planning proposal. 
A rigorous tender process ensures 
our partners share our corporate 
commitment to excellence, innovation 
and responsible business practices. 
We take a leading role in industry 
developments.
Relevance to 
the business 
model and 
strategy
Investors are a key source 
of efficient capital, enabling 
the business to invest 
and grow. 
We continue to grow 
the proportion of beds let 
through long-term nominations 
agreements with Universities, 
underpinning security 
of earnings.
We strive for the best customer 
experience for our students, 
delivered by having the best 
people, the best service and 
the best properties. 
Our people are the key to our service-
focused business, delivering for both our 
customers and our University partners. 
Employing and training the best people 
enables us to provide great customer 
service and operational efficiency. 
We work hard to grow and develop local 
relationships, ensuring our students and 
employees have a positive impact on 
communities in which we operate. 
Working with the right partners ensures we 
are able to drive efficiencies and improve 
margins, from both an operational and 
development perspective while 
delivering consistently high quality 
and innovation.

THE UNITE GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017
Strategic report Our people make Home for Success a 
reality for our students and University 
partners. They make Unite a great place 
to work and an unmatched provider of 
student accommodation.
Our service and commitment to 
students grows from our commitment 
to our employees. This year we’ve worked 
to align our employees’ objectives and 
contributions to Home for Success, the 
thinking that underpins everything we offer 
to students. We’re also making sure we 
continue to recruit great people with a 
new recruitment website which showcases 
why Unite Students is a great place to work.
Recognition
Stars Awards
The Stars Awards is our annual recognition 
event where we reward the great work and 
brilliant performance of our teams and 
employees across the business. This year, 
the categories have been redesigned to 
reflect Home for Success.
Long service
As well as the award winners, this year there 
were also 205 people reaching milestones 
of service. We had 35 people reach ten 
years’ service, four people at 15 years’ 
service and one reaching 20 years’ service. 
Performance
Team Talk Connect 
This event, held at the NEC in Birmingham 
in March, brought all our city and 
headquarters teams together under one 
roof to discuss Unite’s strategic direction, 
Home for Success, new values, plans for 
the future and latest developments.
We followed this up in October with 26 
roadshows across the country, involving 
over 1,000 employees to discuss with them 
how we continue to make Home for 
Success a reality for all of our students. 
Investing in our people
Investment in the training and 
development of our people is crucial 
to our success. We retain our Investor 
in People Gold accreditation, and are 
proud to be a Living Wage employer. 
We continue to invest in leadership 
development, primarily through our 
Becoming a Supervisor and Becoming 
a Manager programmes.
This year, our focus has been on customer 
service training. Service Style, new for 2017 , 
has been designed to help all employees 
to think about the little things they can do 
every day to make life better for our 
students and each other. It focuses on 
what we notice when we’re dealing with 
other people and how we act on it. 
It’s a critical element of Home for Success, 
and aims to ensure we are focused on our 
customers and their needs. 
ASV acquisition
This year Unite acquired Aston Student 
Village in Central Birmingham, our largest 
acquisition, comprising 3,067 beds across 
five large detached properties located on 
Aston University’s campus.
The integration of such a large property 
presented a significant operational 
challenge. 56 University staff joined Unite 
as part of the acquisition. They successfully 
completed rigorous training in our brand, 
values and operating standards to ensure 
a seamless handover of the property 
and the best possible experience for 
our students. 
Office move 
In March 2017 Unite moved to South Quay 
House in central Bristol. 
We carefully examined how other 
organisations utilise their working space, 
including Philips, IKEA and the Environment 
Agency, and how they’re more effectively 
using their office space, with agile working 
spaces. We designed our new space to 
help employees work more flexibly and 
collaboratively. Agile working supports the 
health and wellbeing of our employees, 
making our new office space a great 
place to work. 
Our continued commitment to our people 
is key to who we are and helps us to 
deliver Home for Success.

  Read more about 
our partnership with Aston University on p09
Home for Success makes us an 
attractive partner for Universities. 
Together we create a great University 
experience for our students. Our properties, 
our service and our people coupled with 
our ability to continually invest in our 
portfolio means we are a strong strategic 
partner for Universities facing the challenge 
of long-term accommodation planning. 
Our relationships provide long-term security 
of income and help to build and grow 
our business.
Quality relationships
Developing strong partnerships with 
Universities is about building strong 
individual relationships with senior leaders 
within each institution. This takes time.
Around nine out of ten of our University 
relationships across the UK have now 
existed for more than five years. This, by 
its very nature, is hard to replicate. It also 
ensures we have unique insights in to 
Universities and their needs and remain 
ahead of our competition.
Unique insight
We run student retention workshops 
where we share our insight and customer 
satisfaction data with University partners. 
They also share their own survey findings 
to enable us to work together to deliver 
the best student experience, increase 
satisfaction and aid retention, which are 
both key measures of the new Teaching 
Excellence Framework (TEF).
Feedback from Universities through our 
Reputation Survey also helps inform our 
student experience and product 
specification. Our approach clearly 
demonstrates that we value their 
feedback and our partnerships.
Thought leadership
The higher education sector values 
organisations that can contribute to its 
overall success and that truly care 
about students. 
Our Insight series of research reports 
provides data-led insight into what 
students expect and want from their 
University experiences. We also use 
roundtables and launch events to 
help share this insight with leaders in 
Higher Education. 
Providing our partners with 
competitive advantage
Universities benefit from nominations 
agreements when they do not have 
enough of their own beds to meet their 
accommodation guarantee. They have 
always sought to guarantee residences 
to all first years, but many have not been 
able to as student numbers have grown.
Some also offer all international students 
guaranteed accommodation during 
their entire stay at University, while other 
Universities are now considering extending 
their accommodation guarantee to 
second and third year students. 
Universities also increasingly recognise the 
importance of accommodation to their 
overall student experience and seek 
long-term trusted partners like Unite. 
Contractual agreements to secure 
long-term income
Under a nominations agreement, 
the University guarantees occupancy 
and rents, with a contractual rental uplift 
on multi-year agreements that is either 
RPI-linked or fixed, with a minimum and 
maximum rental uplift achieved by way 
of caps and collars.
The rents are either market rents or at a 
minimal discount to market rents, while 
Unite still operates the building. For 
multi-year deals we are increasingly 
seeing requests from Universities to 
co-brand the nominated buildings.
Unite has also grown the number of 
beds on longer-term agreements: 69% 
of our nominations agreements, by bed 
numbers, are now on a multi-year basis. 
Historically, we have renewed 95% of the 
annual agreements year on year. 
The key benefits of nominations 
agreements for Unite include:
 - Guaranteed rent through the 
occupancy guarantee and rent 
review mechanism
 - Deepening our relationships with 
Universities as we work closely and 
become a preferred partner
 - Allowing us to identify further 
partnership opportunities much 
earlier than our competitors.

THE UNITE GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017
Strategic report In 2017 , the business continued the 
positive performance of recent years. 
Building on the strength of our brand 
and our reputation with customers 
and Universities, we entered our first 
on-campus University partnership with 
Aston University and secured two further 
development-led University partnerships 
with Oxford Brookes University and in 
London with planning support from 
King’s College, London. 
Financial performance has again 
been strong, with a total accounting 
return of 14% and growth in EPRA earnings, 
up 12% to £70.5 million. Profit before tax 
was £229.4 million, which includes property 
revaluations and disposal profits of £169.2 
million (2016: £201.4 million and £136.3 
million respectively). As a result of this 
performance, we are declaring a final 
dividend of 15.4p to deliver a total dividend 
of 22.7p for the full year, an increase of 26% 
year on year.
Unite Students is a service brand and the 
strong performance we have delivered 
for our customers, University partners and 
shareholders is only possible because of 
the talent and hard work of our teams 
across the business. On behalf of the 
Board, I would like to thank them for 
another excellent year.
I would also like to take this opportunity to 
pay tribute to one of our Directors, Manjit 
Wolstenholme, who sadly passed away 
last November. Manjit was a friend and 
colleague and her judgement, insight 
and humanity will be greatly missed.
The recent success of the business is 
founded on a consistent strategy and we 
will continue to focus on delivering its main 
elements: providing a great service for our 
students and University partners; delivering 
quality buildings designed around student 
needs; and generating high-quality 
earnings and maintaining a strong 
capital structure.
The outlook for our market remains 
positive, with ongoing structural growth 
being generated by the strength of the 
world-renowned UK Higher Education 
sector, increasing participation rates, the 
internationalisation of Higher Education 
and the shortage of housing in the UK. 
Whilst the ongoing Brexit negotiations 
and political landscape in the UK present 
a backdrop of some uncertainty, these 
sector fundamentals, together with 
our high-quality portfolio, University 
relationships and market-leading 
operating platform, position us to 
continue performing well in the 
years to come.
Given our confidence in the sector and 
the sustainability of our business model, 
the Board has agreed to increase our 
dividend pay-out ratio to 85 per cent 
of EPRA earnings in 2018 onwards.

DELIVERING
14
THE UNITE GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017
Strategic report I am pleased to report another strong set 
of results for the year ended 31 December 
2017 . We have maintained our focus on 
delivering sustainable growth in recurring 
profits and cash flows over the long term, 
and on delivering a Home for Success for 
all the students who live with us. We do this 
by providing great service and operating 
brilliant buildings, designed specifically for 
students. Our investment discipline ensures 
we maintain a robust capital structure and 
deliver high-quality earnings.
Performance in 2017 resulted in 
another year of growth in EPRA earnings, 
like-for-like rents and development profits. 
EPRA earnings increased by 12% to £70.5 
million and now represents one-third of total 
shareholder returns. The focus on delivery 
of the ongoing earnings performance of 
the business is increasingly underpinned 
by University backed contracts giving us 
the confidence to increase our dividend 
pay-out from 75% to 85% of EPRA EPS 
in 2018.
We will continue to focus on growing 
earnings, both in absolute terms and as a 
proportion of our total return. This is driven 
by our ability to maintain full occupancy, 
to continue growing rental levels on an 
annual basis, the consistent focus on cost 
efficiencies and from the completion of 
our high-quality development pipeline.
Our PRISM operating platform, 
which became fully operational in 
2016, coupled with our experienced 
management and leadership teams, give 
us a unique capability to drive value from 
our portfolio through scale efficiencies and 
revenue management, supporting our 
ongoing income focus. 
We have actively prioritised improving 
the quality of our portfolio by using 
our customer insight and extensive 
local knowledge to align with the top 
performing Universities. We completed 
two important strategic initiatives during 
the year with the acquisition of a 3,067-
bed, on-campus portfolio at Aston 
University and the sale of 4,800 beds 
that did not meet the long-term strategic 
goals of our portfolio. These initiatives are 
supported by our ongoing development 
activity and further University partnership 
opportunities to ensure that we are 
increasingly focused on the best 
Universities in the UK.
Delivering for students
Our business is focused on delivering 
a Home for Success: an affordable, 
consistent and high quality living 
environment that helps students make 
the most of their time at University. Going 
to University should be more than simply 
a stepping stone to employment and 
we strongly believe that where a student 
lives has a material impact on their social 
and academic development. We strive to 
ensure that every aspect of our student 
proposition is therefore designed to 
provide a safe and secure environment 
where they can integrate and develop, 
academically and socially.
Our student proposition is delivered by 
1,400 highly experienced employees, 
whose understanding of students is a 
cornerstone of our success. As part of our 
strategy, we continue to invest in recruiting, 
retaining and developing the very best 
people. This commitment is reflected in 
the results of our employee effectiveness 
surveys and the prestigious Investors in 
People Gold Standard accreditation and 
we are pleased to have achieved the 
Living Wage Employer accreditation. 
We also recognise that going to University 
is a significant investment for young people 
and offer a variety of accommodation 
at different price points, with the majority 
of our rooms concentrated at a mid-
range price point for purpose-built 
student accommodation.

THE UNITE GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S STATEMENT CONTINUED
This commitment to the customer is 
reflected in average occupancy of 
98% and rental growth of 3.5% over 
the last five years. Growing numbers 
of second and third year students, who 
have traditionally preferred to live in private 
rented accommodation, are choosing to 
return to us and now account for over 
two-thirds of our direct-let bookings. 
Customer service satisfaction levels, a key 
performance indicator for us, remain at 
consistently high levels and place us on 
a par with some of the best service 
companies across Europe.
Partner of choice for Universities
Our focus on customer service is closely 
aligned with the priorities of our University 
partners, for whom student experience is 
now a key performance metric under the 
Government’s new Teaching Excellence 
Framework. With students spending more 
time in their accommodation than on 
campus, we can increasingly demonstrate 
to Universities how Home for Success 
supports their strategic ambitions. 
This, combined with a long standing 
commitment to building relationships with 
key University decision–makers, is reflected 
in the latest results of our independently 
assessed University trust survey and means 
that 60% of our accommodation is now 
let to Universities through nominations 
agreements. With an average remaining 
life of six years, these agreements provide 
income and rental growth certainty on 
over half of our revenue.
The delivery of great customer service 
to students and Universities has translated 
into a strong financial performance in 2017 , 
delivering occupancy of 99% and rental 
growth of 3.4% (2016: 98%, 3.8%). With our 
new operating system, PRISM, we have also 
delivered further improvements to our NOI 
margin and overhead efficiency measure.
Our people, University relationships, 
the quality of our portfolio and PRISM, 
our operating platform, set us apart from 
the other operators in the sector. Going 
forward, I am confident they will support 
the future growth and financial 
performance of the business.
Operating quality buildings
The quality, location and scale of our 
portfolio is a key component of our 
business model and long-term strategy. 
We aim to operate buildings in and 
around high quality Universities, where 
student demand is highest. We believe 
that our focus on these institutions is the 
best strategy for driving continued high 
levels of occupancy and rental growth. 
We are therefore focusing our portfolio 
activity on further improving alignment 
to high and mid ranked Universities and, 
in the process, underpinning rental 
growth over the medium and long 
term. We currently have 85% of our beds 
occupied by students attending such 
Universities, which will increase to 90% on 
completion of our existing development 
pipeline, planned acquisitions 
and disposals.
During 2017 , we opened 2,150 new beds, 
added 3,067 beds to our portfolio through 
the Aston Student Village acquisition and 
sold 4,800 beds. Taking into account these 
activities, together with valuation 
movements, the value of our investment 
portfolio (including our share of USAF and 
LSAV) is £2.4 billion as at 31 December 2017 .
The purpose-built student accommodation 
sector continues to attract a significant 
level of institutional capital. Over £4 billion 
of assets were traded in the year, driving 
yield compression across the sector. 
The yield movement on our portfolio, 
on a like-for-like basis, was 15 basis points 
and the portfolio is valued at an average 
portfolio yield of 5.2% (2016: £2.1 billion 
and 5.45% yield).

THE UNITE GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017
Strategic report Development pipeline
We also made excellent progress 
with our development pipeline during 
the year. We completed five new 
buildings over the summer and secured 
an additional two new development 
schemes, which increases our secured 
development pipeline for delivery over 
the next three years to 7 ,550 beds. The 
construction of all our 2018 openings is 
progressing in line with plans. Planning 
consents and build contracts are in 
place for all of our 2019 deliveries and 
we are finalising our plans for schemes 
delivering in 2020.
During 2017 , USAF completed its two 
forward-fund schemes in Oxford and 
Edinburgh and acquired three further 
forward-fund schemes in Durham and 
Birmingham, adding 1,000 beds to the 
portfolio on completion in 2018 and 2019.
The anticipated yield on cost of our 
secured development pipeline is 8.1% 
and prospective returns on new schemes 
outside London remain attractive at 
around 8.0%. The secured development 
pipeline is highly accretive and remains 
a significant component of our future 
earnings growth and could contribute 
10–12 pence per share to EPRA earnings 
once built out.
University partnerships
Following the success of the Aston University 
transaction, Unite has secured two further 
University partnership schemes. Firstly, 
during the year, we acquired the former 
Cowley Barracks in Oxford. Working with 
Oxford Brookes University, we have secured 
planning permission to build 887 beds and 
agreed terms for a 25-year nominations 
agreement with the University, taking our 
partnership with them to over 1,365 beds. 
The agreement provides the University with 
much-needed accommodation and Unite 
with income and rental growth certainty 
over the long term.
Secondly, following the year 
end, Unite recently secured a new 
development site in London. Working 
with planning support from King’s 
College, London we will submit a planning 
application to build around 1,000 beds of 
cluster-flat accommodation in the second 
half of the year. We expect to enter into a 
long-term nominations agreement over 
this property, providing much needed 
capacity in a location where there is a 
severe shortage of high quality affordable 
student accommodation. This is our first 
land acquisition in London since 2013, 
facilitated by the correction in land values 
seen in certain zone 1 locations and our 
ability to unlock value through our 
relationships with Universities.
The initial development returns on these 
University-backed schemes are 6–7%, 
around 100 basis points lower than a 
scheme where Unite takes full letting and 
rental growth risk. However, total returns are 
expected to be 9–10% and given the 
University relationships and the security of 
income the agreements provide, these 
opportunities are strategically important 
and remain value enhancing.
We continue to see attractive 
development and partnership 
opportunities in strong University markets 
and we plan to invest selectively in target 
markets to enhance portfolio quality and 
deliver target returns.
Q&A with the Chief Executive
Richard Smith addresses some topical  
questions from our shareholders
Q What is the impact of the new 
Teaching Excellence Framework on 
your strategy?
A The TEF results reinforce our strategy 
of partnering with mid- to high-ranking 
Universities. Currently 85% of our beds are 
aligned to these types of institutions, and 
with new developments such as Cowley 
in Oxford and Middlesex Street in London, 
we are expecting this to grow to 90% 
on completion of our existing 
development pipeline. 
Student satisfaction and retention 
are key measures of TEF, and we 
believe our strategy can help our 
University partners excel in these areas, 
continuing to make us an attractive 
accommodation partner. 
Q You bought and sold more properties 
than in previous years in 2017. Why? 
A The quality of our portfolio is a key 
differentiator between Unite and our 
competitors. We continually review it to 
ensure we have the best properties, in the 
right locations, and are aligned with mid- 
to high-ranking Universities, supporting the 
quality earnings profile of the business. 
This strategy drives both our acquisitions, 
and our disposal activity. By disposing of 
properties which no longer fit our quality 
criteria, we can continue to invest in 
new, exciting opportunities such as our 
acquisition of Aston Student Village.

Property review on p36

THE UNITE GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S STATEMENT CONTINUED
Acquisitions and disposals
We also continue to target acquisitions 
of completed assets and portfolios that 
enhance the quality of our portfolio and 
the earnings profile of the business. These 
acquisitions are generally targeted through 
our co-investment vehicles due to their 
lower cost of capital, allowing us to 
generate enhanced returns through our 
asset management and acquisition fees. 
During 2017 , USAF acquired one 437-bed 
completed asset in Sheffield for £36 million. 
Since the year end, USAF has acquired 
a 331-bed investment asset in Edinburgh 
for £24 million.
Disposals remain an important part 
of our strategy and we will continue 
to recycle assets out of our portfolio to 
ensure that we can continue increasing 
our exposure to the UK’s best Universities, 
while generating capital to invest in 
further development activity and exciting 
opportunities such as the Aston Student 
Village acquisition. During 2017 , we sold 
£181 million of assets at a £5 million 
premium to book valuations (Unite share). 
We intend to sell £75–125 million (Unite 
share) of assets during 2018 to take 
advantage of the ongoing strength in 
the investment market and to ensure 
that we maintain a strong and flexible 
balance sheet as we progress our 
development pipeline. 
High-quality earnings and a strong 
capital structure
We have achieved 99% occupancy 
across our portfolio and rental growth of 
3.4%. With 60% of this income underpinned 
by University nominations agreements, we 
have a high level of visibility in the ongoing 
occupancy and rental growth outlook of 
the portfolio. In addition to revenue growth, 
a focus on efficiency has resulted in further 
improvements in our NOI margin, which is up 
to 7 4.1% (2016: 73.1%), and in our overhead 
efficiency which shows that our overheads, 
net of management fees, represents 40 
basis points of gross asset value (2016: 40 
basis points). Having put in place a £5 million 
efficiency programme in 2017 (Unite share: 
£3.8 million), we remain confident about 
achieving further efficiency gains and 
delivering our targets of 75% and 25–30 basis 
points by the end of 2018 and will continue 
to review how to deliver further efficiencies 
in 2019 and beyond.
Unite’s share of net debt grew by £27 million 
to £803 million in 2017 . The majority of our 
property and development expenditure 
(Unite share £185 million) was funded by our 
disposal programme with the remainder 
from retained earnings. We reduced LTV to 
31% (2017: 34%) as a result of disposals, the 
conversion of the convertible bond and 
asset value appreciation. This is at the lower 
end of our target range, and we expect to 
increase back to around the mid-30% level 
as we build out the development pipeline. 
Our net debt to EBITDA ratio is 6.5 (2016: 6.9), 
again within our target level of 6.0–7 .0, 
which we intend to maintain.
The Group also secured an investment 
grade credit rating and arranged a new 
£500 million, five-year unsecured debt 
facility, providing additional financing 
headroom, greater flexibility and a 
reduced cost of funding. 
Market and strategy
The outlook for the student 
accommodation sector remains 
positive, with structural factors continuing 
to drive a demand-supply imbalance in 
the cities where we operate. The UK 
Higher Education sector is recognised 
globally for the strength of its Universities 
and the contribution it makes to research, 
innovation, talent development and the 
UK economy more broadly. The UK is 
the second most popular destination for 
international students and has 12 out of 
the world’s top 100 Universities and 59 of 
Europe’s top 200 Universities. In February 
2018, the Government announced a 
Funding Review. The details of the review 
are yet to be made clear but we do not 
believe that it will not have a detrimental 
impact on the UK’s globally-renowned 
Higher Education sector.
Total student numbers again reached 
record levels at over 1.8 million. The 
number of applicants and the number 
of students accepted into courses in 2017 
was at 700,000 and 534,000 respectively 
(2016: 725,000 and 540,000). Despite a fall 
in applications of 3%, Universities were able 
to recruit from the excess of applications, 
resulting in intake falling by less than 
0.5% with applicants still outstripping 
acceptances by 166,000. The small 
reduction in applications was driven 
principally by changes to funding for 
some medical related courses and 
a small reduction in EU students. 
18
THE UNITE GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017
Strategic report Going forward, the gap between 
the number of applicants and University 
places could be impacted by some 
external factors, including the impact 
of the UK leaving the EU. Since 2015, a 
demographic trend has seen a reduction 
in the number of 18–21 year olds, and this 
trend affects the next three years. However, 
participation rates continue to increase 
with applicants still outstripping the places 
offered by Universities. We expect high and 
mid-ranked Universities, where our business 
is focused, to continue attracting more 
students than those at the lower end of the 
league tables and therefore we believe our 
portfolio remains well placed to withstand 
any potential reductions in applications. 
The student accommodation sector 
has attracted significant levels of capital 
investment over the last four years with 
over £16 billion of investment activity. This 
increased investment activity has seen the 
new supply of accommodation increase 
and the total number of purpose-built 
beds (including University-owned beds) 
grow to 580,000 beds representing around 
one-third of the UK’s student population. 
At this level, there remains a shortage of 
purpose-build accommodation compared 
to the numbers of first years, international 
and increasingly second and third-year 
students. The outlook suggests that the 
rate of new supply will continue at a similar 
rate of around 25,000 beds in 2018, before 
starting to reduce in 2019. Moreover, a large 
proportion of the new supply is focused 
on the premium end of the market and 
we believe the competitive threat that it 
poses to our more mainstream 
proposition is limited.
We believe our exposure to changes in 
student numbers and increases in supply is 
mitigated by our alignment and relationship 
with high-quality Universities, underpinned 
by nominations agreements, and remain 
confident that well-located, mid-range, 
direct-let student accommodation will 
continue to support high levels of 
occupancy and rental growth.
Outlook
Building on our consistent 
performance record and supportive 
market fundamentals the Group remains 
well placed to deliver sustainable earnings 
growth in the years ahead. UK Universities 
continue to demonstrate their ability to 
adapt and respond to a changing 
landscape and retain their globally 
recognised status. The demand for high 
quality Higher Education among both 
UK and international students continues 
to grow. Our development pipeline and 
operational expertise provides good 
visibility of future rental growth and 
increasing recurring earnings. We are 
confident that our strategy of aligning 
our operations with the best performing 
Universities in the UK, combined with our 
highly scalable operating platform, 
strong brand and reputation makes us 
well-positioned to extend our market 
leading position.

The Group has the opportunity to grow 
further, uniquely positioned to leverage 
our longstanding University partnerships. 
To ensure delivery, continued focus on 
operational excellence aligned with 
effective risk and assurance management 
is essential. This is especially so at a time 
when the HE sector and the broader 
economy is facing uncertainty during 
Brexit negotiations.
How we do this, and assess our principal 
risks and manage them, are set out on

During the year, the Board 
reviewed our risk appetite in light of 
the key in-year risk developments (set out 
above). This considered both threats to – 
and opportunities in – our business in the 
context of macro and minor developments, 
not only in the PBSA sector, but also the 
broader HE sector, property market 
and economy.
Our risk appetite 
The Group’s risk appetite is considered as 
a fundamental part of the Board’s strategy 
setting and annual budget – it does not 
happen in isolation. Our risk appetite is 
underpinned by our principal financial 
aim to continue delivering low double-
digit total returns and sustainable, 
growing earnings.

RISK MANAGEMENT CONTINUED
Creating the right corporate culture for 
effective risk management 
The Group’s risk management framework is 
designed to identify the principal risks and 
ensure that risks are being appropriately 
monitored, controls are in place and 
required actions have clear ownership 
with requisite accountability. 
The organisation has an open and 
accountable culture, led by a stable and 
experienced leadership team operating 
in the sector for a number of years. This 
culture is set by the Board in the way it 
conducts its Board and Committee 
meetings and cascades through the 
organisation enabling the same culture 
for risk management. 
The culture of the organisation recognises – 
and accepts – that risk is inherent in 
business and encourages an open and 
proactive approach to risk management 
as opposed to a blame culture. By viewing 
our risks through the lens of our 5 strategic 
objectives, the Group is able to ensure risk 
management is pro-active and pre-
emptive and not a tick box exercise.
The Board has the overall responsibility for 
the governance of risks and ensures there 
are adequate and effective systems in 
place. It does this in various ways:
 - Risks are considered by the Board as 
an intrinsic part of strategy setting and 
consideration of new opportunities – 
risk is recognised as an inherent part 
of each opportunity
 - A twice yearly formal review by the 
Board of principal risks, how they are 
changing and considering any 
emerging risks 
 - Risk Committee reviews the principal 
risks that the Group is facing or should 
consider
 - Specific risk management in dedicated 
Board sub-Committees allowing focus 
on specific risk areas (for example, the 
Audit Committee and Health & Safety 
Committee)
 - Risk Committee scrutiny and challenge 
of management activity allowing a 
focused forum for risk identification 
and review 
 - Risk assurance through external and 
internal auditors as well as specialist 
third party risk assurance where 
appropriate (e.g. British Safety Council 
providing specialist independent 
health and safety assurance) 
Stress testing our strategic planning 
Each year, the Board develops and refreshes the 
Group’s Strategic Plan. This is based on detailed 
three-year strategic/financial projections (with related 
scenario planning) and rolls forward for a further two 
years using more generic assumptions. The Board maps 
our strategic objectives against our risk profile. Then, 
always conscious that risk events do not necessarily 
happen in isolation, the Board stress tests these 
projections against multiple combined risk events. 
Through this process, a base case and stress-tested 
Strategic Plan is developed. 
During 2017 , consistent with prior years, this stress-
tested scenario planning considered a material 
reduction in the number of European and international 
students, a material rise in long-term interest rates and 
yield expansion, together with a combination of all 
these events occurring at the same time.

Robust assessment of principal risks
The directors confirm that they have 
conducted a robust assessment of the 
principal risks facing the Group. The 
process for how the Board determined 
these principal risks is explained above 
and the specific principal risks are set out 
on pages 28 to 31.
Viability statement
The Directors have assessed the viability 
of the Group over a three-year period to 
December 2020, taking account of the 
Group’s current position and the potential 
impact of the principal risks. The Directors 
consider the three-year lookout period 
to be the most appropriate as this aligns 
with the Group’s own strategic planning 
period combined with the levels of 
planning certainty that can be derived 
from the development pipeline. Based 
on this assessment, the Directors have 
a reasonable expectation that the Group 
will be able to continue in operation and 
meet its liabilities as they fall due over the 
period to December 2020.
As explained above, the Group has 
developed an annual business planning 
process, which comprises a Strategic Plan, 
a financial forecast for the current year 
and a financial projection for the 
forthcoming three years (which includes 
stress testing and scenario planning and 
also rolls forwards for a further two years).

Once approved by the Board, the plan is 
cascaded down across the Group and 
provides the basis for setting all detailed 
financial budgets and strategic actions 
that are subsequently used by the Board 
to monitor performance. The forecast 
performance outlook is also used by the 
Remuneration Committee to establish the 
targets for both the annual and longer-
term incentive schemes. 
The financing risks of the Group are 
considered to have the potential greatest 
impact on the Group’s financial viability. 
The two principal financing risks for the 
Group are: the Group’s ability to arrange 
new debt / replace expiring debt facilities; 
and any adverse interest rate movements. 
The Group has secured funding for the 
committed future development pipeline, 
which included the first Group unsecured 
loan facility, and prepares its Strategic Plan 
on a fully funded basis in line with the 
three-year outlook period. To hedge 
against the potential of adverse interest 
rate movements the Group manages its 
exposure with a combination of fixed-rate 
facilities and using interest rate swaps for 
its floating-rate debt. During the year, 
the Group has complied with all 
covenant requirements attached 
to its financing facilities.

THE UNITE GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 PRINCIPAL RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES
Market risks
1. Demand reduction (driven by Government policy or other macro events)
Possible events
 - Brexit impacting numbers of EU students coming to study in the UK 
 - Changes in Government policy on Higher Education funding
 - Immigration policy changes affecting international student numbers 
and behaviour.
Impact
 - Potential reduction in demand and hence profitability and asset values
 - Departure from EU impacting EU research grants and EU students coming 
to the UK.
What happened in 2017
 - Brexit uncertainty continues. Whatever the terms of Brexit – “hard” or “soft” – its complexity is very 
time-consuming, resulting in distractions from other policy initiatives. 
 - UK continues as 2nd most popular international destination for students (after the US).
 - Government undertaking a review of University funding and student finance.
 - 2017 student intake broadly in line with 2016. Participation rates have increased, offsetting the 5% 
reduction in applications. Unite has limited exposure to these reduced applications due to relationships 
with high and mid-tariff Universities.
 - 2017 saw stronger growth in the high and mid-tariff Universities. 
 - EU students funding arrangements for duration of study confirmed for 2017/2018 and 2018/2019.
 - Increased focus on quality and length of nominations agreements. 60% secured through nominations 
agreements with 6 years average maturity. 
 - Immigration: the Government has commissioned an independent review of the costs and benefits of 
international students. The review of international student “over stayers” showed the number is around 
4,600 rather than in the 100,000’s as reported in the media before. This is widely seen as good news for 
the HE sector and may result in the removal of international students from the highly politicised net 
migration targets.

2. Demand reduction (due to societal change)
Possible events
 - Concerns over the costs of a University education – affordability and 
value for money
 - Alternative course delivery (such as Massive Open Online Courses)
 - Shorter/more semester-led courses.
Impact
 - More competition for value and reduced demand for year round 
student accommodation in the longer term resulting in lower profitability 
and asset values.
What happened in 2017

Strategic report Financing risks
7.  Unable to arrange new debt or expiring debt facilities cannot be replaced or only  
at high cost. Adverse interest-rate movements
Possible events
 - Unite breaches a loan covenant or fails to replace debt on expiry
 - Interest rate increase.
Impact
 - If unable to replace debt, then possible forced sale of assets potentially 
leading to sales below valuation. Slowdown of development activity. 
Reduced level of profitability 
 - Adverse rate movements can lead to reduced profitability and reduction 
in property values (through resulting expansion of valuation yields and 
lower valuations).
What happened in 2017
The 2.5% Guaranteed Convertible Bonds due 2018 fully converted. Unite assigned 
an investment-grade corporate rating of BBB from Standard & Poor’s and Baa2 
from Moody’s. This reflects the strength of the Group’s capital position, cash flows 
and track record.
This credit rating underpinned our transition to an unsecured capital structure with 
a new £500 million unsecured debt facility, reducing our average cost of debt to 
3.9% when fully drawn. 
At as 31 December 2017 , LTV 31% (December 2016: 34%) and net debt of £803m 
(31 December 2016: £776m).

The Group reports on an IFRS basis and 
presents its performance in line with best 
practice recommended by EPRA. The 
Operations and Property reviews focus on 
EPRA measures as these are our key 
internal measures and aid comparability 
across the real estate sector.
Sales, rental growth and profitability
The key strengths of our operating 
business are our people, our PRISM 
operating platform, our brand and the 
strength of our relationships with Universities. 
We have continued to build on these 
throughout 2017 , resulting in a 12% increase 
in EPRA earnings to £70.5 million (2016: £62.7 
million). This growth has again been driven 
by high occupancy, rental growth and the 
impact of portfolio movements, as well as 
further operational efficiencies and 
ongoing cost discipline.

THE UNITE GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017
Strategic report Finance costs decreased to £45.2 million 
(2016: £45.9 million). An increase in net 
debt of £27 million to £803 million (2016: 
£776 million) was offset by a lower average 
cost of finance of 4.1% (2016: 4.2%) as we 
have added new debt facilities at lower 
average rates, taking advantage of the 
historically low cost of debt. The increase 
in net debt was driven largely by spend on 
development activities which has, in turn, 
led to an increase to £7 .4 million in the 
amount of interest that is capitalised into 
development schemes, up from £5.9 million 
in 2016. We expect the level of interest 
capitalisation to remain at around 
this level given the ongoing level of 
development activity in 2018 and 2019. 
Development (pre-contract) and other 
costs fell to £4.6 million (2015: £5.5 million), 
reflecting the levels of site acquisition, the 
earnings impact of share-based incentives 
and our contribution to our charitable trust, 
the Unite Foundation.
Occupancy, reservations 
and rental growth
Occupancy across Unite’s portfolio 
for the 2017/18 academic year stands at 
99% and like-for-like rental growth of 3.4% 
was achieved on our portfolio. We have 
continued to grow the proportion of beds 
let to Universities, with 60% of rooms under 
nominations agreements (2016/17: 58%), 
up by 5,000 beds over the last three years. 
Enhanced service levels and our extensive 
understanding of student needs have 
resulted in longer-term and more robust 
partnerships with Universities.
Rental income has increased by 
£1 1.7 million, up 7%, as a result of new 
openings and sustained rental growth, 
after the impact of disposals made in 
the year. NOI margin improved to 74.1% 
(December 2016: 73.1%), reflecting further 
operating efficiencies from the PRISM 
operating platform. PRISM provides us 
with the ability to differentiate ourselves 
from other operators, driving efficiencies 
through the use of technology, which also 
provides enhanced levels of service for our 
customers. We maintain our expectation 
that NOI margins will improve to 75% in 2018 
whilst ensuring that we remain focused on 
service level enhancements.
In 2017 , we implemented an efficiency 
programme which will deliver £5 million 
of savings (Unite share: £3.8 million). 
These savings were driven by streamlined 
processes and procedures as a result of 
our student insight, PRISM and the scale 
of the business and will reduce the £24.6 
million of operating costs incurred during 
2017 . These savings mean that we are on 
track to deliver our overhead efficiency 
target in 2018. Recurring management 
fee income from joint ventures remained 
at £14.1 million (2016: £14.0 million), as a 
result of the valuation growth of assets 
under management in USAF and LSAV 
offset by disposal activity. In addition to 
the recurring asset management fees, a 
further £4.3 million of net performance and 
acquisition fees were generated from USAF 
and LSAV (2016: £6.9 million). The USAF net 
performance fee is based on USAF’s 
cumulative total return at 31 December 
2017 and is payable in USAF units.
Q&A with Simon Jones
Operations Director
Simon Jones addresses some topical  
questions from our shareholders
Q What is happening with rental growth 
and occupancy? 
A Like-for-like rental growth of 3.4% was 
achieved on our stabilised portfolio, with 
occupancy at 99%. 
Reservations for the 2018/9 academic 
year currently stand at 75%, which is 
encouraging. We anticipate rental 
growth for the 2018/19 academic year 
to be in the region of 3.0–3.5%. 
Q How do you drive operational 
effectiveness? 
A We are on track to deliver our NOI 
margin target of 75% and overhead 
efficiency target of 25–30bps in 2018. 
The introduction of PRISM has allowed 
us to use technology solutions to free 
up time and allow us to focus more 
on customer service.

we have developed the Placer 
app in a joint venture with NCUB 
and JISC. It matches students seeking 
quality work experience to registered 
employers with available openings.
The app makes career-enhancing 
opportunities available to students 
from any social background.
OPERATIONS REVIEW CONTINUED
During the year, we continued to drive 
value from our proprietary PRISM operating 
platform, delivering both the anticipated 
operational efficiencies and a better 
experience for students. Building on this 
and our unique insight into student life, we 
introduced some significant enhancements 
to our service with a range of new digital 
services, including uChat, which provides 
the opportunity for students to meet their 
flatmates before arriving at University and 
logged over 80,000 messages in the first 
three months of operation. The enhanced 
app, which has been downloaded by over 
40,000 customers and allows app-based 
reporting of noise complaints and 
maintenance requests, has been 
introduced together with a more 
comprehensive pack of pre-arrival 
information and a smoother booking 
system for in-house services, such as 
laundry. We also enhanced our Wi-Fi 
provision, upgrading both bandwith and 
access to ensure satisfaction. The range 
and quality of our digital services now 
represents a key point of competitive 
differentiation for Unite and, going forward, 
we will continue to invest in technology to 
provide a living experience tailored to the 
needs and preferences of today’s student.
We expect the proportion of beds let to 
Universities to remain at or around this level 
in the future. This balance of nominations 
and direct-let beds provides the benefit of 
having income secured by Universities, as 
well as the ability to offer rooms to returning 
students and to determine market pricing 
on an annual basis.
Reservations for the 2018/19 academic 
year are encouraging, at 75% (73% at 
the same point last year) as a result of our 
continued focus of working alongside the 
UK’s best Universities, as well as the success 
of our online marketing strategy and further 
progress through our local marketing 
operation in China. The structural growth 
within the cities we operate, together 
with our differentiated service offering, 
provides us with further confidence in 
future occupancy and supporting rental 
growth for the 2018/19 academic year, 
which we expect to be in the region of 
3.0–3.5%.
Home for Success
Our popularity with students and 
relationship with Universities are both 
consequences of continuous investment in 
our purpose: Home for Success.
Working closely with our University 
partners, we are enhancing our service 
to make the sometimes challenging 
transition to University life as smooth and 
painless as possible and increase student 
retention. As part of this, during the year 
we expanded our network of paid 
student Ambassadors, who provide 
valuable peer-to-peer support for 
students at critical points in their 
journey through University.
Our student insight tells us that employability 
is a key driver of student satisfaction. With 
this in mind, we recently entered a joint 
venture with The National Centre for 
Universities and Business (NCUB) and digital 
education specialists Jisc to launch Placer, 
an app-based service that matches 
students with potential employers that will 
be fully launched in the next few months. 
Placer is working with 22 Universities and 
over 200 employers, of whom half have 
already signed up to the service.
We strongly believe that University is an 
opportunity that should be open to all, 
regardless of their background. During 
the year, we have significantly expanded 
our commitment to the Unite Foundation 
which now provides scholarships for 
170 young people from disadvantaged 
backgrounds who may not have otherwise 
gone to University. The Foundation works 
in partnership with 28 Universities up 
and down the country, for whom it 
forms an important part of their 
efforts to widen participation.

reputation and relationships within the 
Higher Education sector. Our Universities 
Partnerships and Engagement team is 
dedicated to building strong working

Student Ambassador Programme
After a successful pilot, the 
Student Ambassador Programme 
is rolling out to all direct-let and 
nominated properties across the UK 
to enhance the student experience. 
The programme was formulated in 
response to student feedback, 
where a need for a greater sense 
of belonging, community and 
connection was highlighted. 
Students apply and then work 
as paid Student Ambassadors, 
helping new students settle in 
at first after arrival, answering 
questions, organising community 
events and acting as peer support. 
They themselves are mentored 
by Unite employees, and the 
experience and training gained 
from the position can support 
job applications.
The Unite Foundation is our flagship social 
investment and complements a wide 
range of grass roots charitable activity, 
community engagement and employee 
volunteering. Together with programmes 
to drive deeper levels of diversity and 
inclusion across the organisation and 
reduce waste and energy use, it is a key 
cornerstone of our Up to uS responsible 
business programme.
At the heart of Home for Success are 
1,400 highly experienced and dedicated 
people with a passion for helping students. 
Developing our teams remains a priority for 
us and we have implemented new Service 
Style training to the whole organisation 
over the year. This programme ensures 
that we are providing our teams with 
the training required to deliver excellent 
customer service as well as developing 
their careers. Our approach to training and

our Investors in People Gold accreditation 
and we remain committed to remaining a

 - The growth in the value of the Group’s 
share of investment assets (+53 pence), 
as a result of rental growth (+26 pence) 
and yield compression (+27 pence)
 - The value added to the development 
portfolio (+16 pence)
 - EPRA earnings for the period 
(+30 pence)
 - Dividends paid of 18 pence and debt 
exit costs of 5 pence both reduced NAV
Looking forward, our portfolio is 
well placed to deliver continued 
value growth. Our focus on the strongest 
University locations underpins rental growth 
prospects and we will continue to deliver 
meaningful upside from our development 
activity. In total, our secured pipeline is 
expected to deliver 69 pence per share 
of NAV uplift and, together with future 
rental growth and planned disposals, 
13 to 17 pence of earnings per share 
once completed.
Property portfolio
The valuation of our property portfolio 
at 31 December 2017 , including our share 
of gross assets held in USAF and LSAV, was 
£2,595 million (31 December 2016: £2,277 
million). The £318 million increase in 
portfolio value (Unite share) was 
attributable to:
 - Valuation increases of £168 million 
on the investment and development 
portfolios, with like-for-like rental growth 
of 3.4% and yield compression of 
15 basis points
 - Capital expenditure on developments 
of £155 million and £16 million on 
investment assets relating to 
refurbishment
 - Acquisitions of £122 million – primarily 
Aston Student Village
 - Disposals of £176 million
 - Increased share of USAF of £33 million, 
as a result of the performance fee 
earned in 2016 and acquisitions of units 
purchased in the secondary market
We continue 
to improve the 
quality of our 
market-leading 
portfolio.

Q&A with Richard Simpson
Group Property Director
Richard Simpson addresses some 
topical questions from our shareholders
Q The yield targets for University 
partnership developments are lower than 
for direct-let developments. Why is this? 
A It’s true the initial returns on our 
Cowley, Oxford and Middlesex Street 
developments are around 100bps lower 
than where we take full letting and rental 
growth risk. 
Both of these developments are 
supported by University partners, 
and we have already signed a 25-year 
nominations agreement on Cowley. We 
expect to achieve a similar outcome on 
Middlesex Street with another University. 
Given the strength of these University 
relationships, and the security of income 
the agreements will provide, we believe 
these developments are strategically 
important, and significantly 
value-enhancing. 
Q What is driving the valuation growth 
of the investment portfolio? 
A We have delivered rental growth of 
3.4% in the year, which flows through to 
higher valuations. Recent transactions in 
the PBSA market demonstrate the strong 
demand for our assets and the external 
valuers have reflected that in their 
appraisal of our valuations.

institutional capital.
As a result of this ongoing investor appetite 
and subsequent transactions, there has 
been a modest level of yield compression 
across the sector. This movement has been 
most notable in London, where there has 
been the strongest level of demand for

Buildings designed for students
The focus of our property activity is to 
provide buildings designed specifically 
around the needs of today’s student, in the 
best locations alongside high-performing 
Universities. We involve our University 
partners in the design and planning 
process to ensure that we are delivering 
buildings that meet the requirements of 
their students. We also look to continually 
enhance the specification of our estate, 
using technology to enhance customer 
service and drive efficiency savings 
through energy and water savings, 
enhanced Wi-Fi speeds and new features 
to improve the living experience. Our 
development and portfolio activity is 
designed to support this strategic 
approach to ensure that the portfolio is 
best placed to drive full occupancy and 
rental growth in the medium term.
Cowley, Oxford – 887 beds, 
wholly owned
Working closely with Oxford Brookes 
University, we acquired an 887-bed 
property in Oxford, and have agreed 
a 25-year nominations agreement with 
the University. Our partnership with 
Oxford Brookes was instrumental in the 
council granting planning consent for 
development. We are focused on 
identifying opportunities for deeper 
partnerships based on Universities’ 
commitments to long-term nominations 
agreements, thus improving sustainable 
earnings growth. This development will 
be delivered for the 2019/20 academic 
year with total development costs 
expected to be circa £73 million.

The sale of two high-value London studio schemes during the year has reduced our overall London exposure to 42%, down from 47% in 
2016. The regional focus of our development pipeline means that the London weighting is likely to fall to around 40% as the portfolio is 
built out.

THE UNITE GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017
Strategic report 2017 and 2018 completions
We completed five schemes during 2017 
in line with budget and programme. Over 
70% of these beds are let to Universities 
under nominations agreements for the 
2017/18 academic year, with an average 
duration of 10 years.
The 2018 pipeline is progressing well. We 
are on track to deliver five wholly-owned 
schemes in Bristol, Newcastle, Sheffield, 
Portsmouth and Birmingham and, in USAF, 
two forward-funded developments, both in 
Durham, adding a total of 3,062 beds. We 
expect all of the schemes to be fully let for 
the 2018/19 academic year.
Development activity
Development activity continues to be a 
significant driver of growth in future 
earnings and NAV. We have added two 
sites in Leeds and Manchester, representing 
1,600 beds, to our development pipeline 
during the year and secured planning on 
three new buildings. We are continuing to 
see opportunities to secure sites for delivery 
in 2020 and 2021 in strong regional 
locations alongside high-quality Universities 
within our target range of around 8.0% 
yield on cost. Returns on potential new 
direct-let projects in London still remain 
below our hurdle rate of 7 .0% due 
principally to higher alternative use values 
for prospective sites and planning levies.
Regional development pipeline
During the year, we have continued 
to add to our 2019 and 2020 regional 
pipeline and have a total of five schemes 
secured which are expected to deliver 
approximately 4,000 beds in addition to 
our ongoing 2018 projects. All new regional 
developments are being undertaken 
wholly on-balance-sheet and prospective 
returns for the secured pipeline are very 
attractive at an average 8.1% yield on cost.
Planning is in place on all but two of 
the schemes in the pipeline. During the 
year, we have reorganised the phasing 
of deliveries, bringing Liverpool forward 
to 2019 and Aberdeen and Bristol being 
pushed back to 2020. The two new 
schemes, in Leeds and Manchester, 
will be delivered in 2020.

Secured forward-fund pipeline (USAF)
USAF completed two forward-fund assets in 2017 , adding new operational beds in Oxford and Edinburgh. USAF also secured three 
further assets on a forward-fund basis in Durham and Birmingham and acquired two investment assets in Sheffield and Edinburgh. 
These acquisitions are consistent with its strategy to increase exposure to high-quality Universities and to expand its presence in markets 
to take advantage of scale. USAF has around £50 million of acquisition capacity which it intends to invest in the first half of the year.

University partnerships
In addition to growing the value of income underpinned by University-backed nominations agreements, we have made further progress 
with our strategy of delivering ongoing growth through partnerships with Universities. In February, we acquired Aston University’s entire 
accommodation provision, Aston Student Village, totalling 3,067 beds, for £227 million (Unite share: £1 13 million) in our LSAV joint venture. 
The acquisition, which was supported by Aston University, demonstrates the depth of our relationship with the University and the strength 
of the Unite Students brand amongst Universities. The refurbishment works to common areas and shared kitchens are complete and, 
along with the lettings performance and cost efficiencies, are supporting financial performance ahead of plan.
Unite has recently secured two further University partnership schemes. Firstly, during the year, we acquired the former Cowley Barracks in 
Oxford. Working with Oxford Brookes University, we have secured planning permission to build 887 beds and agreed terms for a 25-year 
nominations agreement with the University, taking our partnership with them to over 1,250 beds. The agreement provides the University 
with much-needed accommodation in a location where new development is difficult and Unite with income and rental growth 
certainty over the long term.
Secondly, following the year end, Unite secured a new development site, our first in London since 2013, in Middlesex Street, E1. Working 
with King’s College London, we will submit a planning application to build around 1,000 beds of cluster-flat accommodation in the 
second half of the year. We expect to enter into a long-term nominations agreement over this property, providing much needed, 
capacity in a location where there is a severe shortage of high quality affordable student accommodation.

Strategic report The cost of replacing the cladding is 
expected to be £3–4 million and a 
provision has been included in the 2017 
financial results. If we are successful in 
claims under build contracts, the cost for 
Unite could be lower than the provision.
Where cladding needs to be replaced, 
work is on track and we expect all buildings 
to be open for the 2018/19 academic year. 
The loss of income from the closure of Sky 
Plaza has been reflected in the 2017 results.
The safety of our customers and staff 
remains our primary responsibility. Our 
buildings are modern, well maintained and 
built with advanced fire management 
specifications, and have rigorous fire safety 
management and maintenance regimes. 
We work in partnership with the Avon Fire

management strategies and have been 
externally audited by the British Safety

Asset disposals
During 2017 , £472 million of assets were sold 
in third-party transactions (Unite share: £181 
million), generating £5 million profit on 
a Unite share basis.
The assets were selected for disposal based 
on their relative performance and forecast 
future rental growth. The disposals form part 
of our strategy to align our portfolio to high 
and mid-ranked Universities and to focus on 
more affordable accommodation in the 
best locations in the cities in which we 
operate. Following the completion of 
the disposals, 92% of the Group’s beds 
are in shared apartments, also known 
as cluster flats.
We will continue to recycle assets in the 
portfolio to maintain our focus on quality 
and to maintain capital discipline as we 
continue to see further growth 
opportunities.
Fire safety and cladding
Following the tragic events caused by 
the fire at Grenfell Tower, we completed 
a full review of fire safety across our 
estate. Working with the Department 
of Communities and Local Government 
(DCLG), we undertook testing of cladding 
materials from an estate of 132 buildings. 
Samples from six buildings did not meet 
the standards as set out in the initial test. 
Following the initial test, samples from three 
of the buildings have been submitted for 
retesting to ensure that the full cladding 
system (rather than a sample) is subject 
to test. We expect results in the next 
few weeks.
Following the receipt of the initial test 
results, experts from local fire and rescue 
authorities undertook a detailed inspection 
of the overall design of all six properties and 
the safety measures and procedures in 
place. We took the decision to close one 
of the buildings, Sky Plaza in Leeds, for the 
2017/8 academic year. We worked closely 
with the two Universities and our customers 
in Leeds and were able to find alternative 
accommodation for all affected customers 
across our estate in Leeds. We thank them 
for their understanding and support during 
this challenging period. The local fire 
and rescue authorities concluded that 
the remaining five properties remain 
safe for occupation, subject to some 
minor improvements that have all 
been implemented.

Income statement and profit measures
A full reconciliation of profit before tax 
to EPRA earnings measures is set out in 
summary below and expanded in section 
2 of the financial statements.
The increase in profit before tax is primarily 
the result of a higher level of unrealised

recognised in 2017 compared with the 
£136 million recognised in 2016. As part 
of the new unsecured debt facility, the

Strategic report Cash flow and net debt
The Operations business generated 
£63.2 million of net cash in 2017 (2016: £61.3 
million) and net debt increased marginally 
to £803 million (2016: £776 million). The key 
components of the movement in net 
debt were the operational cash flow, 
convertible bond and the disposal 
programme (generating total inflows 
of £332 million) offset by total capital 
expenditure of £288 million, USAF unit 
acquisitions of £18 million and debt exit 
costs of £11 million and dividends paid 
of £42 million. In 2018, we expect net 
debt to increase as capital expenditure 
on investment and development activity 
will exceed anticipated asset disposals.
Dividend
We are declaring a fully covered final 
dividend payment of 15.4 pence per 
share (2016: 12.0 pence), making 22.7 
pence for the full year (2016: 18.0 pence). 
All of the 15.4 pence dividend will be 
comprised of a Property Income 
Distribution (PID).
Q&A with Joe Lister
Chief Financial Officer and 
Managing Director of People 
and Communications
Joe Lister addresses some topical  
questions from our shareholders
Q During the year you agreed the first 
unsecured debt facility, what does this 
mean for the Group?
A In 2017 , the Group was assigned an 
investment grade corporate rating of 
BBB from Standard & Poor’s and Baa2 
from Moody’s which reflected the 
strength of Unite’s capital position, 
cash flows and track record. The 
credit rating underpinned the transition 
to an unsecured capital structure with a 
new £500 million debt facility that will 
reduce the average cost of debt for 
the Group as it is drawn to fund the 
development pipeline.
The unsecured facility provides us 
with greater flexibility and additional 
firepower to fund our developments. The 
investment-grade credit rating will make 
it easier to raise finance in the future.
Q The Group’s Loan to Value (LTV) ration 
seems low at 31%. Why is that?
A The 31% LTV at 31 December 2017 is 
at the lower end of our target range of  
maintaining LTV at the mid-30% level. LTV 
has benefitted during the year from the 
value growth across the portfolio together 
with the impact of the conversion of the 
£90m convertible bond. We expect LTV to 
return to the mid-30% level as we build out 
the development pipeline.
Subject to approval at Unite’s 
Annual General Meeting on 10 May 
2018, the dividend will be paid in either 
cash or new ordinary shares (a “scrip 
dividend alternative”) on 18 May 2018 
to shareholders on the register at close 
of business on 13 April 2018. The last 
date for receipt of scrip elections will 
be 26 April 2018.
Further details of the scrip scheme, 
the terms and conditions and the process 
for election to the scrip scheme will be 
provided to shareholders with the Annual 
General Meeting documentation when it 
is sent to shareholders in March 2018.

LTV improved to 31% at 31 December 2017 , 
from 34% at the end of 2016 as a result 
of the value growth of the portfolio 
exceeding the increase in net debt 
and the impact of the conversion of the 
convertible bond. We will continue to 
manage our gearing proactively and 
intend to maintain our LTV around the 
mid-30% level going forward, assuming 
current yields. With greater focus on the 
earnings profile of the business, we are 
also now monitoring our net debt to 
EBITDA ratio, which was 6.5 times in 2017 
and we plan to keep this in line with 
current levels going forward.
Interest rate hedging arrangements and 
cost of debt
Our cost of debt has come down 
marginally to 4.1% (2016: 4.2%). Following 
the shift to an unsecured structure, there is 
an opportunity to reduce the cost of debt 
over time as we add new debt to build out 
the development pipeline, replacing 
expensive legacy facilities. Following the 
cancellation of interest rate swaps, the 
Group has 80% of its share of investment 
debt subject to a fixed interest-rate (2016: 
100%) for an average term of 5.3 years.
Convertible bond
The Group’s £90 million convertible bond 
fully converted into equity in June. The 
conversion has resulted in a reduction in 
net debt of £90 million and the issue of 
18,593,589 ordinary shares in Unite Group 
plc. The reduction in net debt has reduced 
LTV by 4% points. The additional shares 
were reflected in the calculation of NAV 
per share in December 2016.
As a result of the quality predictable 
earnings outlook for the business, we are 
planning to increase our dividend pay-out 
to 85% of EPRA earnings in 2018 from the 
current level of 75%.
Tax and REIT conversion
The Group converted to REIT status and 
is exempt from tax on its property business, 
with effect from 1 January 2017 . The 
deferred tax liability relating to unrealised 
gains on joint venture investments of £20.6 
million, which are not exempt from tax, 
exceeds the deferred tax asset relating to 
tax adjusted losses carried forward of £11.3 
million. As the losses can be set against 
gains as they arise, the deferred tax asset 
relating to the losses can be recognised in 
full against deferred tax liabilities.
Certain activities, primarily the 
fees generated from the investment 
management of joint ventures, are 
subject to tax which we expect to be 
in the region of £2–3 million per annum.
Debt financing
The Group has continued to maintain 
a disciplined approach to managing 
leverage, with LTV of 31% at 31 December 
2017 at the lower end of our target range. 
The Unite Group plc was assigned an 
investment grade corporate rating of BBB 
from Standard & Poor’s and Baa2 from 
Moody’s, reflecting the strength of Unite’s 
capital position, cash flows and track 
record. The credit rating underpinned the 
transition to an unsecured capital structure 
with a new £500 million unsecured debt 
facility that will reduce the average cost 
of debt to 3.9% when fully drawn.

Following the acquisition of the Aston Student Village, LSAV does not have any acquisition capacity. The development phase of the joint 
venture expired at the end of 2017 . Any further acquisitions or investments would require mutual consent from both Unite and GIC.
Unite has increased its share in USAF to 24.6% through the additional units issued from the performance fee and third-party acquisition 
of £19 million of units during 2017 .

21 February 2018
The asset management fees from both 
USAF and LSAV have remained at similar 
levels to prior years as a result of the 
valuation growth in the portfolios under 
management during the year being 
offset by disposal activity.
A net performance fee of £3.4 million 
was earned from USAF and this fee was 
paid in units in early February. The level 
of the fee is sensitive to movements in 
property valuations and is therefore lower 
than in 2016 due to the high level of yield 
compression in 2015 and 2016.

RESPONSIBLE BUSINESS REVIEW
At Unite, we have a unique opportunity to 
help our students adopt responsible living 
and embed habits that will last a lifetime, 
encouraging the next generation to make 
positive social, environmental and 
economic contributions.
As a company we are committed to 
being a responsible business in all aspects 
of our operation, acting with integrity and 
fairness. We work hard to create a diverse 
and highly skilled workforce that feels 
valued and engaged and delivers positive 
social impact to the communities we 
operate in, with specific focus on improving 
access to education. Management and 
accountability for our responsible business 
activity is embedded in our day-to-day 
operations, and our acquisition and 
development programme, and is 
overseen by a steering group chaired 
by our CFO, Joe Lister.

succeed at University 
and beyond.
Gender diversity
46
THE UNITE GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017
Strategic report Unconscious bias 
As part of our commitment to diversity, 
equality and inclusion, we are employing 
training tools and workshops to help line 
managers make better decisions when 
recruiting, developing and retaining 
talent. Research has shown that the 
beliefs and values that we gain from 
family, culture and experiences heavily 
influence how we view and evaluate both 
others and ourselves. 
Our new Unconscious Bias workshop is 
designed to raise awareness of how 
unconscious bias effects and underpins 
many of the decisions line managers 
make in recruitment, and to help them 
recognise the potential for unconscious 
bias in their day-to-day responsibilities.
Bristol Pride
Bristol hosted its seventh annual Pride Day 
in 2017 , with Unite as the headline sponsor. 
Bristol Pride Day was the culmination of a 
week-long festival in the city celebrating 
the LGBT+ community and the diversity 
and inclusiveness of Bristol as a whole.
We were proud to be involved 
and show our support for the event as 
headline sponsor, promoting a message of 
inclusiveness with the ‘Room for Everyone’ 
theme. Lots of Unite employees turned out 
to ensure our presence was a success, while 
our very own Shaun the Sheep also turned 
up to show support for the cause. 
Great Workplace
We want Unite to continue to be 
a great place to work, and we are 
committed to continuing improvement 
to ensure this. You can read more about 
our commitment to our people on p08.
Diversity & inclusion
In 2017 we hosted the first action group 
meeting to share our ambition to improve 
diversity and inclusion within Unite. 
Since this original meeting, members of the 
group have been working hard to identify 
best practice and assess the priorities for 
our business. Our initial discussions have 
focused on LGBT+, disability, women and 
BAME (Black, Asian, and minority ethnic) 
groups and our findings will be collated into 
a road map of activity for 2018, ensuring 
Unite takes a leading role in inclusion.
Our new Diversity, Equality & Inclusion 
eLearning course is available through our 
eLearning Portal and must be completed 
by all employees. This training ensures that 
everyone at Unite understands their role in 
delivering on our ongoing commitment to 
Diversity, Equality and Inclusion. It is also 
designed to reinforce our determination 
to attract and retain the very best people 
from a variety of backgrounds by creating 
an environment where everyone feels 
comfortable to be themselves through 
respect and encouragement.
Health and safety
Health and safety has always been an 
essential and integral part of our business, 
but following the tragic events of the 
Grenfell Tower fire, we have renewed our 
focus on this critical area. All employees 
must complete mandatory health and 
safety training appropriate for their role and 
related to the properties they work in. We 
regularly run employee communications 
campaigns across a range of key areas, 
including personal responsibility, fire safety 
and student welfare, including substance 
and alcohol misuse. You can read our 
Health and Safety Committee Report 
on p72.
Human rights
Unite believes that human rights are 
universal and recognises that the UN 
Guiding Principles on Business and Human 
Rights set a standard of conduct expected 
of companies. We do our best to ensure 
that everyone involved or associated with 
our business is protected, treated fairly and 
subject to our anti-bribery and corruption, 
health and safety, anti-slavery and other 
policies including those covering data 
protection, performance management, 
flexible working, grievances, leave, and 
equality and diversity.

THE UNITE GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 RESPONSIBLE BUSINESS REVIEW CONTINUED
Good management
Good management ensures we measure, 
manage, procure and report effectively 
on energy and water usage and waste 
management. In 2017 we simplified our 
supplier arrangements in order to focus on 
delivering further efficiencies in 2018. 
We appointed a single national water 
supplier, Source for Water, and appointed 
BIFFA as our single national waste 
contractor. Working with a single 
waste-management provider will 
deliver improvements in consistency 
and coverage of recycling provision 
across our estate. It also delivers improved 
data on waste generation and landfill 
diversion to help us to continue to improve 
and report in these areas. 
A major achievement in 2017 was 
an agreement with our electricity 
supplier Npower to purchase 100% 
REGO (Renewable Energy Guarantee 
of Origin certificates) backed 
renewable energy. We also made 
further improvements in reporting of our 
environmental performance by launching 
a new online reporting system aligned with 
the new GRI Standards, available in the 
“Responsibility” section of our corporate 
website. We also retained our listing on the 
FTSE4Good index, and improved both our 
GRESB (Global Real Estate Sustainability 
Benchmark) and CDP scores. 
Efficient buildings
2017 saw the completion of detailed 
energy surveys of each individual property, 
highlighting energy efficiency opportunities 
across the estate. Working with our partners 
at Sustain, we have developed a bespoke 
data analysis and modelling tool to help 
produce fully costed, individual energy 
efficiency plans for each property, 
which informs our five-year energy 
efficiency programme. 
In January, we also joined the 
Innovation Gateway, a network 
of leading organisations including 
Universities, committed to finding the best 
transformational approaches to reducing 
the environmental impacts of their estates. 
Anti-bribery and corruption
It is important our employees act with 
the utmost integrity. We have robust 
anti-bribery and corruption policies 
and procedures in place and require 
our suppliers to have the same. We also 
implement mandatory anti-bribery and 
corruption training for all employees on 
an annual basis. 
The Environment
We want to reduce our impact on the 
environment and actively encourage 
responsible behaviours in our employees, 
students and suppliers. 
Highlights and commitments 
In 2017 we continued to improve on our 
environmental performance. As a result, 
we were recognised in the 2017 Energy 
Awards for our Sustainability Engagement 
Programme, and shortlisted in the 2017 and 
2018 EDIE Sustainability Leaders Awards. 
We reduced our total carbon emissions 
by 8.8% from 2016 to 2017 using the UK 
national grid average emissions intensity 
(Scope 1+2 location based emissions), 
from 53,162 tonnes CO
2
e down to 48,478 
tonnes CO
2
e. We also reduced our water 
consumption by 17% across the business. 
We achieved Green Star status in 
the Global Real Estate Sustainability 
Benchmark (GRESB) for the third year 
running, receiving a four-star rating and 
were ranked second in our peer group. We 
also retained our listing on the FTSE4Good 
Index, reflecting improvements in our ESG 
reporting and disclosure. 
We have made significant advances 
in recycling, with estate-wide rollout 
of recycling bins in flats and the 
appointment of a single national 
contractor for commercial waste. 
From May onwards, we also began 
purchasing 100% renewable energy. 
During 2017 we also made further 
progress to improve the environmental 
performance of our new buildings, through 
BREEAM’s environmental assessment 
methodology. We appointed 3Adapt to 
advise on the environmental performance 
of our new construction projects, and 
achieved a BREEAM Excellent rating for our 
Salisbury Court development and BREEAM 
Very Good ratings for St Luke’s View and 
Millennium View. 
We also made significant progress 
improving the performance of our existing 
buildings, including:
 - Continued installing LED lights and 
controls as part of our estate-wide LED 
lighting programme, completing 
over 120 buildings to date.
 - Commenced energy efficiency 
improvement works to a small 
number of sites to ensure they 
comply with the 2018 Minimum 
Energy Efficiency Standards.
 - Retrofitting high-pressure CO
2
 air-
source heat pumps to provide hot 
water as part of a major refurbishment 
of Sidney Webb House.
 - Installed networked heating 
and hot water controls system 
in Waverley House.
Sustainable behaviour 
Our Up to uS Sustainability Engagement 
Programme is now in its fourth year and 
continues to grow. It was recognised at 
the 2017 Energy Awards, winning the 
Behavioural Change & Employee 
Engagement Award. We are committed to 
helping our employees and students adopt 
lasting, responsible living and working 
habits. Aligned with the NUS Green Impact 
Awards, the programme uses individual, 
national and local initiatives to maximise 
engagement. In 2017 our network of 
Sustainability Champions worked with over 
1 17 student volunteers, with our city teams 
achieving 27 NUS Green Impact Awards, 
including 8 Gold Awards.

Charity of the Year Programme
Each year our city teams and head 
office nominate local charities to 
support for the academic year, 
and work to engage students and 
employees with the charity through 
fundraising events and volunteering. 
British Heart Foundation
This year we began a partnership 
with BHF to offer donation stations 
throughout our properties and 
offices, giving our students and 
employees an easy way to 
recycle their unwanted items, 
while contributing to a great cause. 
In its first year of partnership, these 
donations have raised more than 
£272,000, providing enough funding 
for a two-year research programme 
into overcoming heart disease. 
BHF has also worked with us to 
deliver provide CPR training in all 
of our 24 cities, training more than 
500 students and employees in 
life-saving techniques.
“We are delighted to be working with 
Unite Students. On behalf of the BHF 
I would like to say a huge thank you to 
everyone who has contributed to the 
partnership, encouraging your customers 
to donate their unwanted items for us to 
sell throughout our network of shops, 
which so far has help raised an incredible 
£272,000, which has far exceeded our 
expectations for the first year. This money 
will help fund vital research into cardio-
vascular disease in Universities across 
the UK. I look forward to continuing our 
partnership for the 2017/18 academic year 
and hearing more about Unite Students’ 
fantastic success.”

RESPONSIBLE BUSINESS REVIEW CONTINUED
Social Impact
We are committed to delivering positive 
impacts to help young people succeed 
in further education and build sustainable 
lives, while supporting the communities 
we work in. 
In 2017 , we donated £1.6 million to 
charities, including the Unite Foundation, 
and our charity of the year, the British 
Heart Foundation. We have now 
exceeded a total of £1 million in giving to 
charities through facilitated and in-kind 
donations since we commenced activity 
in this area in 2014. 
2017 has seen our strategic partnership 
develop extensively with Into University 
through the development of lifeskills 
sessions, and the introduction of two 
community charity partnerships through 
the use of commercial spaces.
Supporting charitable organisations that 
align with our Home for Success purpose 
and our values is very important to Unite. 
We have a unique opportunity to raise 
awareness of charitable giving and actions 
with the future generation of supporters. 
Working with charities also provide 
fulfilling engagement opportunities for our 
employees, students and Universities alike. 
Unite Foundation
Unite is the founder of and major donor 
to the Unite Foundation, a charitable trust 
established to support talented students 
facing challenging circumstances through 
the provision of free accommodation 
annual scholarships. The Foundation has 
so far provided scholarships for 250 young 
people working in close collaboration 
with 28 Universities, an increase from 
10 University partners in 2016. Currently 
44 scholars have graduated with 
support from the Foundation. 
Scope 1 and 2 emissions have been 
calculated in line with the DEFRA 
Environmental Reporting Guidelines 
2013. DEFRA 2015 emissions factors 
have been used, except for market-
based emissions which have been 
calculated using an emissions factor 
reflective of our electricity supplier’s 
generation mix, as shown below:

Strategic report 1625 Independent People, 
Nelson Drake House, Bristol
1625 Independent People (1625ip) 
supports young people aged 
16–25 who are at risk of becoming 
homeless or are already homeless. 
Unite Students has provided premises 
at a reduced rent to house a new 
service. 1625ip and Bristol City 
Council work in partnership to deliver 
an innovative youth homelessness 
prevention service which aims to help 
young people to stay at home with 
their families as well as learning to 
live independently.
“This support from Unite Students means we 
are able to concentrate more resources on 
helping families to prevent homelessness in 
the first place and is an excellent example 
of a successful business caring about and 
helping with the needs of a city it works in.”
Dom Wood
CEO, 1625ip
Volunteering
Volunteering provides a great opportunity 
for both our employees and our students 
to engage with local communities in a 
rewarding way. By providing our resources 
and expertise to organisations, we can 
make a tangible difference, while 
encouraging team building, motivation 
and engagement among employees. 
Similarly, our students also develop skills 
outside the lecture theatre, which they 
take with them beyond University.
Now in its third year, our employee 
volunteering programme has gone 
from strength to strength. Each year, our 
employees are able to take one day, or 7 .5 
hours, out of their schedule to volunteer for 
local charities that support young people. 
Since its launch in 2015, our employees 
have volunteered more than 5,000 hours to 
charitable organisations, with an average of 
19% of our employees taking part annually. 
Supporting charities in the community
We know that local charities are 
having a tougher than ever time 
with funding. Finding affordable 
commercial premises that meet the 
needs of their operation is an uphill 
struggle for many. In 2017 , we worked 
with two charities, in London and 
Bristol, to provide suitable premises 
at a nominal rent compared to the 
commercial market.
MahaDevi Yoga Centre, Eden Grove 
Community Centre, London
Mahadevi Yoga offer dedicated yoga 
therapy treatments to children and 
adults with special needs. This new 
centre, located at our Stapleton House 
building, is the culmination of a 
partnership between Unite Students 
and Islington Council. The space we 
have provided at a reduced rent 
enables the centre to increase the 
number of local families they are able 
to support. The larger premises also 
provide space for commercial yoga 
sessions, which funds a bursary to allow 
low-income families to access the 
centre’s resources.
“We have been delivering this pioneering 
Yoga Method - Yoga for the Special Child 
- to families across Islington for the last six 
years. Our new centre will allow us to offer 
up to 150 one-to-one sessions per week, 
that’s three times more contact hours than 
we were able to provide at our previous 
centre. It’s fantastic being able to work with 
even more people because we know what 
a difference it makes in our community. We 
are immensely grateful to Unite Students 
and Islington Council for supporting us to 
help so many deserving families across the 
borough. This initiative really showcases 
what local business, working with local 
authorities, can do to help support charities 
like ours and the wider community.” 
Denisa Nenova
Founder, MahaDevi Yoga Centre
Lifeskills and preparedness
This year we have begun to trial lifeskills 
sessions with 16–18 year olds, following 
feedback from students living with us 
and our own research insights. The focus 
of these sessions is to introduce younger 
students to shared accommodation, 
and prepare them for the communal 
living that is common to most 
University experiences. 
More than 100 students have taken part 
in the trial and the feedback has been 
overwhelmingly positive. In 2018, we 
intend to build on this initial first phase, 
incorporating delivery of these sessions 
into our employee management training 
programmes, and developing a peer-led 
model to allow students already living in 
shared accommodation to get involved.
Affordability 
Unite Students recognises that going to 
University now represents a big investment 
for students, and their accommodation is a 
significant component of those costs. We 
have a responsibility to ensure that the 
living environment we offer our students 
represents good quality accommodation 
at the best possible value for money. 
To meet the students’ needs, we offer 
a choice of room types at different price 
points, in purpose-built environments, which 
include common spaces and, wherever 
possible, a quiet study room and outdoor 
space. Our proposition further differs from 
traditional House in Multiple Occupation 
(HMO) properties, where we believe we 
represent better value in a number of key 
areas. These include not charging booking 
or administration fees, and offering a range 
of flexible payment plans. Our rents also 
include a range of value-added 
components such as all-inclusive utility 
bills; high-speed broadband access; a 
fortnightly cleaning service for shared 
spaces; comprehensive contents insurance; 
on-site laundry services; 24-hour security; 
a 24-hour helpline service centre; and 
discounts with well-known high-
street retailers. 
In setting our rents, we will continue 
to routinely work with Universities’ 
accommodation services, through 
nominations agreements and more widely, 
to ensure that the living environment we 
offer our students represents the best 
possible value for money.
Our 2017 Strategic Report from pages 1–51

THE UNITE GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 CHAIRMAN’S INTRODUCTION TO GOVERNANCE
This is built on our well-established and 
long-term University partnerships, which 
we’ve developed over more than 25 years 
operating in the higher education sector. 
The Board has overseen the Group’s 
portfolio strategy with a substantial 
investment in quality properties. This 
has required delivery of a complex 
development pipeline on time and to 
budget, large acquisitions (such as 
Aston Student Village, our first University 
partnership transaction secured in 2017) 
and disposals (such as our portfolio sale 
and Woburn House, London). This strategy 
has been well executed, with 85% of our 
properties now nominated at mid/
high-tariff Universities or those ranked 
Gold or Silver by the Teaching 
Excellence Framework. 
At the same time, the Board has led 
the roll-out of a broad range of diversity, 
equality and inclusion initiatives as well as 
Service Style training. This ensures we keep 
both our people and our service levels at 
the highest standard.
 
The Board has also overseen the transition 
of our financial structure, with a £500m 
unsecured facility announced in 2017 . 
This, along with longer-term University 
partnerships securing revenue and rental 
growth coupled with our digital operating 
platform, ensures continued delivery of 
quality income and sustainable earnings. 
The Grenfell Tower tragedy underlines 
the critical importance of fire safety, 
something we have always recognised as 
our biggest safety risk. The Group Board, 
along with our dedicated Health & Safety 
Committee, has led a comprehensive fire 
safety review in the year. We have worked 
with fire safety experts on the ACM 
cladding identified on 6 of our properties, 
with the Committee overseeing our 
remedial plan see page 41. 
Ross Paterson joined the Board as 
a Non-Executive Director in September. 
We welcome his valuable FTSE 250 
operational and financial experience. 
The year ended sadly with the sudden 
and tragic passing of Manjit Wolstenholme, 
our Senior Independent Director and Audit 
Committee Chair. Manjit helped ensure the 
Group’s financial rigour and delivery and 
will be sorely missed. 
The importance of effective governance 
continues, especially now with the maturing 
PBSA sector and the broader uncertainties 
due to Brexit and its impact on the UK’s 
higher education sector, real estate 
and economy. 
Unite’s overall governance framework 
has been designed to help us manage 
these external and internal changes, 
enabling the Board to provide the 
necessary oversight and challenge to 
secure the Group’s long-term success. 
The following pages offer insight into 
how we are building on our decades 
of experience in the sector and creating 
a sustainable and successful business.

Corporate governance statement Governance overview
The Board’s governance role in developing and implementing our strategy 
Governance framework Our governance framework, underpinned by the UK Corporate Governance Code, continues 
to support our strategy and ensure our long-term sustainable success. Like our risk management 
framework (described on page 24), our governance framework is driven by an open and 
collaborative Board and broader Unite Students culture, creating an environment for people 
to have confidence to challenge the norm.
Below and on the next two pages, we cover how governance has supported our strategy during 
2017 and how this is linked to our principal risks. We also describe our governance priorities for 2018.
 
  Read more on p54
Leadership On pages 56 and 57, we describe the composition of the Board and explain their skills and 
experience. Pages 60 to 61 explain how the Board is collectively responsible for the long-term 
sustainable success of Unite, its clear division of responsibilities and the role of the Non-Executives 
in constructively challenging and developing our strategy.
 
  Read more on p56
Effectiveness Page 65 describes how our governance framework ensures the effectiveness of the Board. 
The results of this year’s externally facilitated board evaluation are on page 65. The Nomination 
Committee report (page 66) describes how we ensure we have the right skills and experience 
on the Group Board as well as how we develop our future leaders, integral to succession planning.
 
  Read more on p65
Accountability The Audit Committee report (pages 68 to 71), together with our risk management framework 
and principal risks (pages 24 to 31), describe how we ensure a fair, balanced and understandable 
assessment of Unite’s position and prospects, the assessment of our principal risks and their 
alignment with our strategic objectives. This section also notes how we maintain an appropriate 
relationship with Deloitte, our external auditors, consistent with the Code and statutory requirements.
 
  Read more on p68
Remuneration In what is an increasingly complicated regulatory area, our “Remuneration at a Glance” section 
(page 78) is intended to provide an overview of this complex area. The detailed remuneration report 
(pages 75 to 95) describes how we ensure Executive Director remuneration is designed to promote 
the long-term success of the Company and how we develop these remuneration policies. 
Shareholder relations 
and engagement
Page 59 describes how we engage with shareholders, which during 2017 included a Capital 
Markets Day in April, and a second Capital Markets Day in November at Aston Student Village.

SHAREHOLDER RELATIONS
The Board prioritises effective 
communication with shareholders and 
other providers of capital to the business 
and welcomes their views on the Group’s 
approach to corporate governance. 
In addition to the final and interim 
presentations, a series of meetings 
between institutional shareholders and 
other providers of capital and senior 
management were held throughout 2017 . 
The Board is made aware of the views 
of major shareholders concerning the 
Company through, among other means, 
regular analyst and broker briefings and 
surveys of shareholder opinion. These will 
continue throughout 2018. 
The Board, together with its professional 
advisers, actively analyses the Register 
of the Company with a view to ensuring 
its long-term stability.
The Company maintains a corporate 
website containing extensive information 
of interest to both institutional and private 
investors. The Company has frequent 
discussions with shareholders on a range 
of issues affecting its performance, both 
following the Company’s announcements 
and in response to specific requests. The 
Company regularly seeks feedback on 
the perception of the Company amongst 
its shareholders, the investor community 
more broadly and its stakeholders.
Save in exceptional circumstances, 
all members of the Board attend the 
Company’s Annual General Meeting and 
shareholders are invited to ask questions 
during the meeting and to meet with 
Directors prior to, and after, the formal 
proceedings. At the meeting, the Chairman 
reviews the Group’s current trading.
The results of the votes at the Annual 
General Meeting, together with details of 
the level of proxy votes lodged for each 
resolution is made available on a regulatory 
information service and on the Company’s 
website at www.unite-group.co.uk.
Notice of the Annual General Meeting 
is set out on page 156 to 159.

THE UNITE GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 LEADERSHIP
Corporate culture and governance 
leadership 
The Group is home to 50,000 students 
during a crucial stage of their personal 
development and with Universities right 
across the UK. The Board has ultimate 
responsibility to Unite Students’ shareholders 
for all the Group’s activities as well as a 
broader responsibility extending to 
environmental and social issues.
To discharge this broader responsibility 
effectively, the Group needs to operate in 
an open, harmonious and transparent 
manner, ensuring open communication 
between the Board and senior leaders. 
This is why various members of the senior 
leadership team regularly present to the 
Board. During 2017 , Unite’s Operations 
Director, Student Experience Director, 
Head of Digital, Area Managers, 
Development Director, Funds Director 
(representing our various co-investment 
vehicles), University Partnerships Director 
and Head of Legal & Company Secretary 
(among others) presented to the Board. 
This direct access to management 
opens dialogue beyond the boardroom. 
Additionally, with Board meetings taking 
place in cities across the UK, the Board 
visits both new developments and existing 
properties and meets with our Operations 
teams. This gives it a grounded insight to 
the implementation of our overall 
business strategy.

THE UNITE GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017
Corporate governance statement How the Board operates
Board operating rhythm – linked to 
strategy and business oversight
The Board has an annual operating 
rhythm with an agenda of items for the 
forthcoming year built around our strategic 
objectives. The Board’s meetings are split 
between strategy (considered in light of 
emerging risks and the approval of specific 
investments above certain thresholds) and 
routine operational, property and financial 
updates (providing context for the strategic 
discussions as well as governance oversight 
of in-year activity).
Meetings take place throughout the 
UK, often at Universities so the Board 
can meet Vice-Chancellors and learn 
about their experiences with Unite, their 
accommodation requirements more 
generally and broader developments 
in the higher education sector.
The Board is able to oversee the setting and 
implementation of the Group‘s strategy 
due to a flat management structure; three 
members are Executive Directors and 
therefore actively involved in day-to-day 
implementation. This executive perspective 
is balanced by five Non-Executive 
Directors, including the Chairman, who 
bring a depth and breadth of experience 
in senior management, higher education, 
finance, customer service and real estate. 
Senior leaders are regularly invited to 
attend meetings and present to the 
Board. This provides the Board, and in 
particular the Non-Executives Directors, 
with direct and open access to leaders 
throughout the Group and helps build a 
culture of openness and directness. In 
addition, external experts are also invited 
to present to the Board (such as University 
Vice-Chancellors and property valuers) to 
give the Directors a broader and 
independent perspective.
Details of the number of Board and 
Committees meetings held during the 
year, and Director attendance, is available 
in the table on page 64.
Regular updates from the Board 
Committees on their activities 
and recommendations
Ensure that the detailed work performed in the Board Committees is considered 
by the Board as a whole.
Operational, property and 
financial updates
Provide the Board with the necessary information to track the Group’s 
performance and challenge any problems with performance.
Market and Higher Education 
sector updates
Ensure the Board is equipped with the most up-to-date knowledge and 
understanding of the industry and environment in which we operate.
Strategy and five-year plan
Discuss, review and approve our strategy and five-year plan, and track how we 
are performing against our current strategy and five-year plan.
Risk
Review and discuss our principal risks at a Group level and also review operational 
level risks (the Board’s operational risk review is to verify that risks have been properly 
identified and that appropriate risk-mitigation plans are being correctly managed 
with clear actions and ownership).
New development schemes
Review and challenge new development schemes being recommended by 
management and, due to the significant capital expenditure involved and key 
strategic decisions required, approve these new development schemes. 
Training
Review of the Board’s training needs and ensure that the Board is up to date on 
key legal and regulatory changes. During 2017, this was focused on social media, 
information technology and Corporate Governance developments.
Review of Group policies
Review of key Group policies, such as the Anti-Bribery Policy, to ensure they are 
appropriate and implemented effectively.

The composition of the Board during 2017 
is set out in the table on page 64.
The Board currently consists of the 
Chairman, three Executive Directors and 
four Non-Executive Directors.
In accordance with the requirements of 
the Code, each of the current Directors 
offers themselves for re-election at the 
Annual General Meeting to be convened 
on 10 May 2018. Brief biographies of all the 
Directors are set out on pages 56 and 57 . 
Following the individual performance 
evaluations of each of the Non-Executive 
Responsibility and delegation
A schedule of specific matters is reserved 
for the Board. Those include:
 - approving the strategic objectives 
of the Group and the business plan 
to achieve those objectives
 - approving major investments, 
acquisitions, mergers and divestments
 - approving major development 
schemes
 - approving appointments to 
and dismissals from the Board
 - reviewing systems of internal control 
and risk management
 - approving policies relating to 
Directors’ remuneration.
Role Description
Chairman Phil White’s principal responsibilities are:
 - to establish, in conjunction with the Chief Executive, the strategic objectives 
of the Group for approval by the Board
 - to organise the business of the Board
 - to enhance the standing of the Company by communicating with shareholders, 
the financial community and the Group’s stakeholders generally.
Chief Executive Richard Smith has responsibility for:
 - establishing, in conjunction with the Chairman, the strategic objectives of the 
Group, for approval by the Board
 - implementing the Group’s business plan and annual budget
 - the overall operational and financial performance of the Group.
Senior Independent Director As Senior Independent Director, Elizabeth McMeikan’s principal 
responsibilities are to:
 - act as Chairman of the Board if the Chairman is conflicted
 - act as a conduit to the Board for the communication of shareholder concerns 
if other channels of communication are inappropriate
 - ensure that the Chairman is provided with effective feedback on his performance.
Directors seeking re-election, it is confirmed 
that the performance of each of these 
Non-Executive Directors continues to 
be effective. They each demonstrate 
commitment to the role, and add value 
and relevant experience to the Board.
Roles
The Group’s terms of reference for the 
Chairman and the Chief Executive clearly 
establish the division of responsibility 
between the two roles. Summaries 
of those roles, and that of the Senior 
Independent Director, are set out 
in the table below.
These topics are scheduled as part 
of the Board’s annual operating rhythm 
and forward agenda or brought to the 
Board on an ad hoc basis.

THE UNITE GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017
Corporate governance statement EFFECTIVENESS
Induction 
On appointment to the Board, each 
Director takes part in a comprehensive 
and personalised induction programme. 
This induction is also supplemented with 
ongoing training throughout the year to 
ensure the Board is kept up to date with 
key legal, regulatory and industry updates. 
Ross Paterson, who joined the Board in 
September 2017 , underwent an induction 
programme following this framework:
 - The business and operations of the 
Group and the Higher Education sector; 
the role of the Board and matters 
reserved for its decisions; the terms of 
reference and membership of Board 
Committees; and powers delegated 
to those Committees
 - The Group’s corporate governance 
practices and procedures and the latest 
financial information about the Group
 - The legal and regulatory responsibilities 
as a Director and, specifically, as a 
Director of a listed company.
As part of the induction programme, 
each Director also visits key locations to 
see our business operations and properties 
first-hand and the Higher Education 
institutions with which we partner. Also, they 
meet with key senior executives, so from the 
outset they have access to managers 
throughout the organisation to help them 
form their own independent views on the 
Group, its performance and the sector we 
operate in. In addition, they are given the 
opportunity to meet with representatives of 
the Company’s key advisors.
Performance evaluation
Each year the Board, its Committees 
and Directors are evaluated considering 
(among other things) the balance of 
skills, experience, independence and 
knowledge on the Board, its diversity 
(including gender), how it works together 
as a unit and other factors relevant to its 
effectiveness. During 2017 , we conducted 
an externally facilitated evaluation. The 
framework and output from this year’s 
external evaluation is summarised below. 
Chairman and Non-Executive Directors
The Board considers each of its four Non-
Executive Directors to be independent. 
Accordingly, the Company meets the 
requirement of the Code in relation to 
members of the FTSE 350 that at least half 
of the Board (excluding the Chairman), is 
made-up of independent Non-Executive 
Directors. In addition, Phil White (Chairman 
of the Board) was considered independent 
on his appointment to that role.
The Chairman and the Non-Executive 
Directors constructively challenge and 
help develop proposals on strategy, and 
bring strong, independent judgement, 
knowledge and experience to the Board’s 
deliberations. Non-Executive Directors 
are expected to commit approximately 
20 days per annum to the business of 
the Group.
The terms and conditions of 
appointment of the Non-Executive 
Directors are available for inspection 
at the Company’s registered office and 
at the Annual General Meeting.
Training 
The Board considered it important 
that the Committee Chairs continue to 
receive sector and relevant functional 
training (such as on accounting, corporate 
governance and executive remuneration 
reporting developments) and accordingly 
the Committee Chairs attend relevant 
external seminars. The Board as a 
whole receives ongoing training on 
corporate governance and other 
relevant developments. 
 - Based on Corporate Governance 
Code: Leadership, Effectiveness, 
Accountability, Remuneration and 
Relations with Shareholders
 - A 360 degree perspective: interview 
feedback from all Board members and 
external advisers; Board and 
Committee meeting observation; 
documentation review 
 - Core areas of Board business 
and focus: strategy and business 
performance, people and talent, risk 
management, core governance and 
compliance, strategic investments/
divestments
 - Relationships and communication: 
quality of discussion and decision 
making processes, raising and handling 
of difficult issues, Board/Executive Team 
interaction.
What the Board does well 
 - Respect and value the diverse skills and 
perspectives of each other. Strong 
belief that the whole is greater than the 
sum of the parts 
 - Good debates and reaches consensus 
on the business issues facing the Group. 
Confidence that the quality of 
discussion results in the Group following 
the best course of action
 - Clear engagement with strategy, 
values and people and commitment to 
continuous improvement in operating 
as a Board. 
The future 
 - Important to be bold and take 
necessary action to maintain 
market leadership 
 - Be purposefully challenging and 
actively guard against complacency. 
 - Develop plan for future succession to 
ensure resilience and sustain the 
Board’s positive culture and leadership. 
 - Continued refinement of 
performance metrics – transparency, 
alignment and rigour (both financial 
and non-financial)
 - Evolving landscape for remuneration 
and corporate culture 
 - Nurture the overall “health” of the 
Board; look after what it values - the 
balance of the Board and its positive, 
collaborative culture.

THE UNITE GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 EFFECTIVENESS: NOMINATION COMMITTEE REPORT
Nomination Committee Chair’s overview
The Committee’s focus this year has been 
on our talent development and succession 
planning. The Committee mapped the 
business’s strategic objectives and growth 
ambitions against our wider leadership 
and high performing high-potential 
individuals. Where gaps are identified, 
the Committee ensures a suitable 
programme is in place to deliver our 
leaders of tomorrow with the right 
skills and experience. 
The year ended sadly with the sudden 
and tragic passing of Manjit Wolstenholme, 
our Senior Independent Director and 
Audit Committee Chair. Manjit had been 
instrumental to the sustainable growth 
and financial delivery of the business over 
the last six years we had the pleasure of 
working with her, and she will be sorely 
missed. The Committee decided to wait 
until the New Year before it considered 
potential appointees for these two key 
positions. Following a review in January 
2018, Elizabeth McMeikan and Ross 
Paterson were appointed as our 
Senior Independent Director and 
Audit Committee Chair respectively. 
I am confident they will be able to 
continue the excellent work that 
Manjit had done.

Committee overview
Composition
The Committee is comprised entirely 
of Non-Executive Directors. The members 
of the Committee are set out on page 60 
of the Corporate Governance Statement. 
At the invitation of the Committee, any 
other Director or other person may be 
invited to attend meetings of the 
Committee if considered desirable in 
assisting the Committee in fulfilling its role.
Role
The role of the Committee is to:
 - Ensure that appropriate procedures 
are adopted and followed in the 
nomination, selection, training, 
evaluation and re-election of Directors 
and for succession planning, with due 
regard in all cases to the benefits of 
diversity on the Board, including gender
 - Regularly review the structure, size, 
composition, skills and experience 
of the Board and to make 
recommendations with regard to any 
adjustments considered necessary
 - When it is agreed that an appointment 
to the Board should be made, lead a 
selection process that is formal, rigorous 
and transparent 
 - Be responsible for identifying, reviewing 
and recommending candidates for 
appointment to the Board.
Succession planning 
and talent pipeline 
development 
continued as a key 
area of focus for the 
Committee. This 
extends to developing 
high-performing 
individuals beyond 
the Board to help 
secure the business’s 
long-term 
sustainability.

THE UNITE GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017
Corporate governance statement ACCOUNTABILITY
Activities in 2017
Review of Board composition 
The Committee reviewed the 
Board’s composition to ensure it has 
the correct balance of skills, experience, 
independence and knowledge. 
Recognising that the average tenure 
of the Non-Executive Directors was just 
over 6 years and to help ensure orderly 
succession planning, the Committee 
believed it was timely to consider an 
additional Non-Executive Director. The 
Committee felt that someone currently 
serving as an Executive Director in a listed 
business with strong financial expertise 
would be a useful addition to the Board. 
Based on this remit, the Committee led a 
recruitment process, which resulted in the 
appointment of Ross Paterson in 
September 2017 . 
Succession planning
As per prior years, the Committee reviewed 
the Board’s succession planning, to ensure 
we have a deep talent pipeline for future 
Board appointments. As an integral part of 
our executive succession planning, the 
Committee oversees the Senior Leadership 
Development Programme (part of a 
broader Skills Development Programme) to 
ensure we are growing and nurturing our 
talent and developing our high-potential, 
high-performers. 
Board diversity 
The Board recognises that diversity, 
equality and inclusivity at Board level 
and throughout the Group is a critical 
component of our long-term sustainability. 
We are proud of the diversity of the Group 
as a whole, an organisation made up of 
employees, who like our customers, are 
from many different backgrounds and 
countries and have diverse experiences, 
perspectives and skills. 
Beyond the boardroom and within 
Unite Students more generally, we have 
continued to review our approach to 
diversity, equality and inclusion during 2017 . 
We recognise this as a key building block 
of our People strategy and that the UK 
workforce and our students are increasingly 
diverse. To remain competitive, we need to 
develop a diverse, equal and inclusive 
workplace which will in turn best represent 
and support our customers in creating a 
Home for Success. 
During 2017 , our D&I initiatives have 
focused on: 
 - Launching our Diversity in Action 
Group led by, and for, employees
 - Widening our recruitment channels to 
bring in increased diversity 
 - Training all recruiting managers and 
the resourcing team on unconscious 
bias, to ensure that we are recruiting 
the best person for the job
 - Introduced Diversity, Equality and 
Inclusion eLearning for all employees, 
to be repeated annually
 - Ensuring all customer-facing teams are 
diverse and appropriately 
representative of our local community 
and our students
 - Actively supporting our high potential 
female employees
 - Ensuring all leadership roles have 
diverse candidates on the short list
 - Working with Stonewall, Business in the 
Community and the Business Disability 
Forum to raise our awareness
 - Reviewing our HR policies and 
procedures to be more inclusive with 
related line-manager training
In 2018, we will focus on: 
 - Development and growth of our 
Diversity in Action Group
 - Focus groups and Pulse Surveys across 
the organisation to understand more 
about our employee needs
 - Launch of Women’s Network followed 
by further networks as appropriate
 - Use of specialist job boards to support 
sourcing diverse candidates
 - Further recruitment training for all 
hiring managers
 - Continue to work with Stonewall, 
Business in the Community and the 
Business Disability Forum
 - Work Equality Index completed and 
recommended actions taken
We have set diversity targets for our People 
with 40% female in leadership roles by 2020. 
We are currently at 37%.
  Read more about 
Diversity and inclusion on p47
As regards to the Board itself, the 
Nomination Committee considered 
during 2017 whether it wanted to set 
specific targets for female representation 
on the Board. The Committee believes 
the current focus of diversity and inclusivity 
should be on the Group as a whole 
with the development of a diverse and 
inclusive talent pipeline incorporating the 
initiatives outlined above. The Committee 
is not currently considering setting diversity 
targets for the Board itself, believing this is 
not necessarily in the best interests of the 
Group and its stakeholders. However, 
gender diversity, along with all other 
aspects of diversity and inclusivity, will be 
considered, along with its more general 
remit to consider the balance of skills, 
experience, independence and 
knowledge when reviewing 
appointments to the Board. 
Internal control 
The Board has overall responsibility for 
the Group’s system of internal control. 
However, such a system is designed to 
achieve business objectives and can only 
provide reasonable and not absolute 
assurance against material mis statement.
The provisions of the Code in 
respect of internal controls require that 
Directors review and monitor all controls, 
including operational, compliance and 
risk management as well as financial 
controls. Through reports from the Board’s 
Committees, the Group’s Risk Committee 
and the Group’s Business Unit Board 
(the Management Board), the Board has 
reviewed the effectiveness of the Group’s 
system of internal controls for the period 
covered by the annual report and 
accounts and has concluded that 
such controls were effective 
throughout such period.
Further information on the Company’s 
internal control framework is set out in 
the Audit Committee Report on pages 
68 to 71. The Board delegates certain of 
its duties, responsibilities and powers to 
the Audit Committee, so that these can 
receive suitably focused attention, but in 
so doing the Audit Committee acts on 
behalf of the full Board, and the matters 
reviewed and managed by the Audit 
Committee remain the responsibility 
of the Directors taken as a whole.
Going Concern
After making enquiries, the Directors 
have a reasonable expectation that the 
Group and the Company have adequate 
resources to continue in operational 
existence for the foreseeable future. 
For this reason, they continue to adopt 
the going concern basis in preparing 
the accounts.
Risk management
The Board, when setting the strategy, 
also determines the nature and extent 
of the principal risks and its risk appetite 
in implementing this strategy. Each year 
the Board reviews the effectiveness of the 
Group’s risk management systems and 
how the Board did this during 2018 is set 
out on pages 24 to 31.

THE UNITE GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 ACCOUNTABILITY: AUDIT COMMITTEE REPORT
Following the extremely tragic and 
sudden death of Manjit Wolstenholme 
on 24 November 2017 , Ross Paterson was 
appointed to the role of Chair of the Audit 
Committee on 1 February 2018. Ross is the 
current Finance Director at Stagecoach 
Group plc, a member of the FTSE 250, he 
also chairs the Audit Committee at Virgin 
Rail Group Holdings Limited so is well 
placed to chair the Audit Committee 
of the Group. 
The Committee is very grateful for Manjit’s 
effective chairmanship and contribution 
to the work of the Committee. 
Audit Committee Chair’s overview 
During the year, the Audit Committee 
continued its key oversight role for the 
Board with its specific duties as set out 
in its terms of reference to reassure 
shareholders that their interests are 
properly protected in respect of the 
Group’s financial management 
and reporting. 
The Audit Committee works to a structured 
programme of activities, with agenda 
items focused to coincide with key events 
in the annual financial reporting cycle. 
The Committee reports regularly to the 
Board on its work. 
During 2017 , the Committee has continued 
to monitor the integrity of the Group’s 
financial statements and supported the 
Board with its ongoing monitoring of the 
Group’s risk management and internal 
control systems in line with the enhanced 
requirements from 2015 under the 
Corporate Governance Code. 
The Committee also determined 
the focus of the Group’s internal audit 
activity and reviewed its findings and 
verified that recommendations were being 
appropriately implemented. In addition, 
recognising the value of an effective 
whistleblowing channel, the Committee 
again reviewed arrangements for the 
Group’s employees to raise concerns 
in confidence. 
During 2017 , the Audit Committee 
undertook the second full evaluation 
exercise of the Deloitte audit approach to 
ascertain the effectiveness of the external 
audit function. Further to the completion 
of the evaluation of the external audit 
process we are satisfied with both the 
auditor’s independence and audit 
approach and have recommended to 
the Board that Deloitte be re-appointed 
as auditor in 2018. 
As noted in this Corporate Governance 
Statement, the Board delegates certain 
of its duties, responsibilities and powers 
to the Audit Committee, so that these 
can receive suitably focused attention. 
However, the Audit Committee acts 
on behalf of the full Board, and the 
matters reviewed and managed by 
the Committee remain the responsibility 
of the Directors as a whole.
Role of the Audit Committee
The Audit Committee has delegated 
authority from the Board set out in its written 
terms of reference. The terms of reference 
for the Audit Committee take into account 
the requirements of the Code and are 
available for inspection at the registered 
During the year,

Corporate governance statement office and at the Annual General Meeting, 
and can also be found on the Group 
website at http://www.unite-group.co.uk/
about-us/corporate-governance. 
The key objectives of the Audit 
Committee are:
 - To provide effective governance and 
control over the integrity of the Group’s 
financial reporting and review significant 
financial reporting judgements
 - To support the Board with its ongoing 
monitoring of the effectiveness of the 
Group’s system of internal controls and 
risk management systems
 - To monitor the effectiveness of the 
Group’s internal audit function and 
review its material findings
 - To oversee the relationship with the 
external auditor, including making 
recommendations to the Board in 
relation to the appointment of the 
external auditor and monitoring the 
external auditor’s objectivity and 
independence.
Composition of the Audit Committee
The members of the Committee are 
set out on page 60 of this Corporate 
Governance Statement. The Committee 
members are all independent Non-
Executives and have been selected 
with the aim of providing the wide range 
of financial and commercial expertise 
necessary to fulfil the Committee’s duties. 
The Board considers that as a chartered 
accountant and serving Finance Director 
of a FTSE 250 company, I have recent and 
relevant financial experience.
Meetings are attended, by invitation, by 
the Chief Financial Officer, the Deputy 
Chief Financial Officer and the Group 
Financial Controller.
I also invite our external auditor, Deloitte, 
to each meeting. The Committee regularly 
meets separately with Deloitte without 
others being present. As appropriate, I also 
invite our internal auditor, PwC, to attend 
the meetings. Deloitte and PwC meet 
independently of management to ensure 
alignment, to update on respective 
findings and consider the impact on 
the relative approaches of their work.
Committee meetings
The Committee met five times during the 
year and attendance at those meetings is 
shown on page 64 of this Corporate 
Governance Statement. 
Main activities of the Committee during 
the year 
Meetings of the Committee generally 
take place just prior to a Group Board 
meeting and I report to the Board as 
part of a separate agenda item, on the 
activity of the Committee and matters of 
particular relevance to the Board in the 
conduct of its work. At its five meetings 
during the year, the Committee focused 
on the following activities.
The Committee reviewed the half-year 
and annual financial statements and the 
significant financial reporting judgements. 
As part of this review, the Committee 
supported the Board by reviewing the 
financial viability and the basis for 
preparing the accounts on a going 
concern basis as outlined below. The 
Committee also reviewed and challenged 
the external auditor’s report on these 
financial statements. 
As discussed above, the effectiveness 
of the external audit function was 
considered during 2017 . During the 
evaluation process the Committee 
considered: the independence and 
objectivity of the external auditor; the 
make-up and quality of the audit team; 
the proposed audit approach and the 
scope of the audit; the execution of the 
audit and the quality of the audit report to 
the shareholders; as well as ultimately the 
fee structure. 
The Committee discussed reports from 
PwC as the Group’s internal auditor on 
their audit and assessment of the control 
environment. The Committee reviewed 
and proposed areas of focus for the 
internal audit programme of review 
including the approach to ensure that 
the internal audit activity continues to be 
aligned to the principal Group risks. 
Financial reporting
The primary focus of the Committee, in 
relation to financial reporting in respect of 
the year ended 31 December 2017 , was to 
review with both management and the 
external auditor the appropriateness of 
the half-year and annual financial 
statements concentrating on:
 - The quality and acceptability of 
accounting policies and practices
 - The clarity of the disclosures and 
compliance with financial reporting 
standards and relevant financial and 
governance reporting requirements
 - Material areas in which significant 
judgements have been applied or 
where there has been discussion with 
the external auditor
 - Whether the annual report and 
accounts, taken as a whole, is fair, 
balanced and understandable and 
provides the information necessary for 
shareholders to assess the Group’s 
position and performance, business 
model and strategy.
The Committee’s assessment of the annual 
report to ensure that it is fair, balanced 
and understandable took into account 
the following considerations:
 - A review of what fair, balanced and 
understandable means for Unite
 - The high level of input from the Chief 
Executive Officer and Chief Financial 
Officer with early opportunities for the 
Board to review and comment on the 
annual report
 - Ensuring consistency in the reporting 
of the Group’s performance and 
management information (as 
described on pages 22 to 23), risk 
reviews (as described on pages 24 to 
31), business model and strategy (as 
described on pages 4 and 5 A cross-
check between Board Minutes and the 
annual report is undertaken to ensure 
that reporting is balanced
 - Whether information is presented in a 
clear and concise manner, illustrated 
by appropriate KPIs to facilitate 
shareholders’ access to relevant 
information
To aid our review, the Committee considers 
reports from the Group Financial Controller 
and also reports from the external auditor 
on the outcomes of their half-year review 
and annual audit. As a Committee, we 
support Deloitte in displaying the necessary 
professional scepticism their role requires.
The Committee’s assessment of the annual 
report to ensure that it is fair, balanced 
and understandable took into account 
the following considerations:
Significant issues considered by 
the Committee 
After discussion with both management 
and the external auditor, the Committee 
determined that the key risk of misstatement 
of the Group’s 2017 financial statements 
related to:
 - Property valuations
 - REIT compliance
 - Joint venture accounting
Property valuations
The Group’s principal assets are 
investment properties and investment 
properties under development that are 
either owned on balance sheet or in USAF 
or LSAV. The investment properties are 
carried at fair value based on an appraisal 
by the Group’s external valuers who carry 
out the valuations in accordance with the 
RICS Red Book valuation guide, taking into 
account transactional evidence during 
the year. The valuation of property 
assets involves significant judgement 
and changes in the core assumptions 
could have a significant impact on 
the carrying value of these assets. 
Management discuss the underlying 
performance of each asset with the 
external valuers and provide detailed 
performance data to them including rents, 
University lease agreements, occupancy, 
property costs and costs to complete (for 
development properties). Management 
receives detailed reports from the valuers 
and performed a detailed review of the 
valuations to ensure that management 
considers the valuations to be appropriate. 
The valuation report is reviewed by the 
Chief Financial Officer and the Group 
Property Director prior to sign-off.
Strategic report Corporate governance Financial statements Other information 69
THE UNITE GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 ACCOUNTABILITY: AUDIT COMMITTEE REPORT CONTINUED
the PID requirement will be satisfied. The 
combined PID from the distributions made 
during 2017 comprise 78% of the Group’s 
forecast tax-exempt property rental 
business profit, leaving a small amount 
that can be paid as part of the May 
2018 distribution.
Joint venture accounting
Two of Unite’s significant assets are its 
investments in USAF and LSAV which the 
Group has historically accounted for as 
joint ventures.
The Group reports under IFRS 10 – 12 
which provides guidance on how 
an investor should account for its 
interests in other entities, including a 
definition of control and guidance on 
how to classify and account for jointly 
controlled arrangements. During the 
year, management undertook a detailed 
review of its classification for both USAF 
and LSAV, and following that analysis 
concluded that both USAF and LSAV 
should continue to be treated as joint 
ventures. The Committee considered 
this and agreed there was no material 
change and accordingly it was 
appropriate to continue to account for 
USAF and LSAV as a joint venture under 
IFRS 11, with Unite recording its 24.58% 
share of the results and net assets of 
USAF as a joint venture using equity 
accounting and likewise 50% for LSAV. 
Risk management
The Group’s risk assessment process and 
the way in which significant business risks 
are managed is a key area of focus for 
the Committee.
Our work here was driven primarily 
by performing an assessment of the 
approach taken by the Group’s Risk 
Committee, chaired by Joe Lister, Chief 
Financial Officer. The Risk Committee is 
responsible for the delivery of the Group’s 
Risk Management Framework, which 
the Committee has approved, and the 
Group’s assessment of its principal risks and 
uncertainties, as set out on pages 28 to 31. 
The Board also formally reviewed 
the Group’s principal risks at two 
meetings during the year. Through 
these reviews, the Committee 
considered the risk management 
procedures within the business and 
was satisfied that the key Group risks 
were being appropriately managed. 
The risk assessment flags the importance 
of the internal control framework to 
manage risk and this forms a separate 
area of review for the Committee.
During the year, the Committee and/or 
the Board met with members of the 
Group’s valuer panel and challenged 
them on the basis of their valuations and 
their core assumptions, including the yield 
for each property, rental growth and 
forecast costs. 
The Committee questioned the external 
valuers on market trends and transactional 
evidence that supports the valuations. The 
Committee was satisfied that the Group’s 
valuers were appropriately qualified and 
provided an independent assessment of 
the Group’s assets. The Committee was 
satisfied that an appropriate valuation 
process had taken place, the core 
assumptions used were reasonable and 
hence the carrying value of investment 
and development properties in the 
financial statements was appropriate.
The auditor explained the audit 
procedures to test the valuation 
of investment and development 
properties and the Group’s 
disclosures on the subject. On the basis 
of the audit work, the auditor reported no 
inconsistencies or misstatements that were 
material in the context of the financial 
statements as a whole.
Further analysis and detail on asset 
valuations is set out on page 36.
REIT compliance
With effect from 1 January 2017 , the Group 
converted to REIT status. As a REIT, profits 
from the Group’s property rental business 
and gains on disposal of property assets are 
exempt from UK corporation tax. As a result, 
the Group does not recognise a deferred 
tax liability in relation to unrealised gains 
on investment properties, or accelerated 
capital allowances on property rental 
business assets. Maintaining REIT status 
involves significant judgement about the 
future performance of the business and 
compliance with the REIT rules and there 
would be a material impact on the Group’s 
tax charge and financial results of not 
remaining compliant with the REIT regime.
The Group monitors compliance with 
the REIT requirements on a quarterly 
basis to confirm that the interest cover test 
and balance of business test in relation to 
income are met. The balance of business 
test relating to assets is determined 
based on figures at 1 January 2017 
and so compliance has already 
been confirmed for the year.
The Group has modelled tax adjusted 
property business profits for five years and 
declared PIDs in respect of the May 17 and 
November 17 distributions to ensure that 
Internal controls
Led by the Group’s risk assessment process, 
we reviewed the process by which the 
Group evaluated its control environment. 
Management is responsible for establishing 
and maintaining adequate internal 
controls. Internal controls are designed to 
provide reasonable assurance regarding 
(among other things) the reliability of 
financial reporting and the preparation of 
the financial statements for external 
reporting purposes. A comprehensive 
strategic planning, budgeting and 
forecasting process is in place. Monthly 
financial information and performance 
insight is reported to the Board.
The Committee’s work to review the 
effectiveness of the internal controls was 
driven by the Group Financial Controller’s 
reports on the effectiveness of internal 
controls, supported by the work of the 
internal auditor and their reports to the 
Audit Committee. The feedback from the 
Group’s internal auditor on specific areas 
of control is tested on a periodic basis and 
our external auditor is requested to provide 
specific feedback and assessment of the 
Group’s financial controls and highlight 
any areas of weakness. No significant 
weaknesses were identified through the 
course of the Committee’s reviews.
Internal audit
The Group engages PwC to perform 
internal audit activity, with this internal 
audit function reporting directly to the 
Audit Committee. 
The Committee considered and approved 
the scope of the internal audit activity to 
be undertaken during 2017 and looking 
forward on a twelve month basis to ensure 
that the internal audit approach is more 
adaptable to the risk environment. The 
Committee also discussed and challenged 
the output from the internal audit reviews 
undertaken in the prior year and concluded 
that the reviews provided good support for 
statements made by management and 
that the control environment is robust in 
the areas tested over the last three years. 
During the year, PwC focused their 
internal audit work on revenue and 
receivables, procure to pay, project 
management and IT service continuity. 
All areas of internal audit were being 
reviewed for the first time in 2017 , aside 
from procure to pay, and, overall, PWC 
concluded that there were no significant 
issues and controls were well designed, 
but noted there were some areas of 
improvement to be made to maximise 
controls and operational efficiency, 
which management is in the process 
of implementing.
70
THE UNITE GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017
Corporate governance statement External audit
The effectiveness of the external audit 
process is facilitated by appropriate audit 
risk identification at the start of the audit 
cycle which we receive from Deloitte in 
a detailed audit plan, identifying their 
assessment of these key risks. 
For the 2017 financial year, the significant 
risks identified were in relation to one 
valuation of properties, REIT compliance, 
revenue recognition, management 
override, and the classification of joint 
ventures. These focus areas were 
discussed at the Committee and it was 
agreed that they should be the principal 
areas of focus as they represent the areas 
with the greatest level of judgement and 
materially impact the overall performance 
of the Group. These risks are tracked 
through the year and we challenged 
the work done by the auditor to test 
management’s assumptions and 
estimates around these areas. 
We assess the effectiveness of the audit 
process in addressing these matters 
through the reporting we receive from 
Deloitte at both the half-year and 
year-end and also reports from 
management on how these risks 
are being addressed. 
For the 2017 financial year, the Committee 
was satisfied that there had been 
appropriate focus and challenge on the 
primary areas of audit risk and assessed the 
quality of the audit process to be good. We 
hold private meetings with the external 
auditor at each Committee meeting to 
provide additional opportunity for open 
dialogue and feedback from the 
Committee and the auditor without 
management being present. Matters 
typically discussed include:
 - The auditor’s assessment of business 
and financial statement risks and 
management activity thereof
 - The transparency and openness of 
interactions with management, 
confirmation that there has been no 
restriction in scope placed on them by 
management and the independence 
of their audit
 - How they have exercised professional 
scepticism
I also meet with the external lead 
audit partner outside the formal 
Committee process.
Independence and external 
audit tender
The Committee considers the re-
appointment of the external auditor, 
including the rotation of the audit partner 
which is required every five years, each 
year and also assesses their independence 
on an ongoing basis. The Group put the 
external audit out to tender in May 2015 
and appointed Deloitte as the external 
auditor following a robust review; the 2015 
year-end was the first year with Deloitte as 
the Group auditor and as such we are in 
year three of the audit cycle with 
Deloitte in 2017 . 
The Committee reviewed Deloitte’s audit 
work and determined that appropriate 
plans are in place to carry out an effective 
and high quality audit. Deloitte confirmed 
to the Committee that it maintained 
appropriate internal safeguards to ensure 
its independence and objectivity. As part 
of the Committee’s assessment of the 
on-going independence of the auditor, 
the Committee receives details of any 
relationships between the Group and 
Deloitte that may have a bearing on their 
independence and receives confirmation 
that they are independent of the Group.
As discussed above, an assessment of 
Deloitte’s effectiveness, its processes, audit 
quality and performance was undertaken 
in May 2017 following completion of the 
2016 audit. 
The Committee confirms compliance 
with the provisions of CMI Order 2014.
Non-audit services
To further safeguard the objectivity 
and independence of the external 
auditor from becoming compromised, the 
Committee has a formal policy governing 
the engagement of the external auditor to 
provide non-audit services. No material 
changes have been made to this policy 
during the year. This precludes Deloitte 
from providing certain services, such as 
valuation work or the provision of 
accounting services.
For certain specific permitted services 
(such as reporting accountant activities 
and compliance work), the Committee 
has pre-approved that Deloitte can be 
engaged by management, subject to 
the policies set out above, and subject 
to specified fee limits for individual 
engagements and fee limits for each type 
of specific service. For all other services, or 
those permitted services that exceed the 
specified fee limits, I as Chairman, or in my 
absence, another member, can pre-
approve permitted services.
During 2017 , Deloitte acquired a 
consultancy business, Market Gravity, 
which at the time had already been 
engaged to provide advisory services to 
the Group. Market Gravity’s work with the 
Group related to supporting the services 
offered to our students and as such did 
not constitute any management decision 
making or financial reporting which the 
Audit Committee therefore felt 
comfortable to approve this work to 
continue. Subsequent to their acquisition 
and the initial activity detailed above, the 
Audit Committee gave their approval for 
the second and third phases of the work. 
The combined fees for the non-audit 
services performed by Deloitte, were 
£0.4m which virtually all related to the 
Market Gravity work referred to above. 
During the year, Deloitte charged the 
Group £0.3 million for audit services. 
While the level of non-audit fees is greater 
than the audit fees charged to the Group, 
the Committee is comfortable that the 
auditor’s objectivity and independence 
has not been compromised due to the 
nature of the work undertaken by Market 
Gravity not involving management 
decision-making, preparation of financial 
data or the design and implementation 
of internal controls. 
The Committee approved the fees for 
audit services for 2017 after a review of the 
level and nature of work to be performed, 
including the impact of the convertible 
bond, REIT conversion and accounting 
standard changes, and after being 
satisfied by Deloitte that the fees were 
appropriate for the scope of the work 
required. These fees are also benchmarked 
against other listed real estate companies 
of comparable size and complexity.
Committee evaluation
The Committee’s activities formed part 
of the evaluation of Board effectiveness 
performed in the year. Details of this 
process can be found under 
‘Performance evaluation’.

THE UNITE GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 ACCOUNTABILITY: HEALTH & SAFETY COMMITTEE REPORT 
Health and Safety Committee 
Chair’s overview
Fire has always been identified as 
our biggest safety risk and the Grenfell 
Tower tragedy underlines the critical 
importance of effective health and 
safety governance. There are always 
lessons to be learnt and room for 
continuous improvement. The Health 
and Safety Committee is committed to 
ensuring this happens within our business. 
Immediately after the Grenfell Tower 
tragedy, we undertook a fire safety 
review of all our properties. This identified 
Aluminium Composite Material (ACM) 
cladding on 6 of our properties. We worked 
with the DLCG, local fire services and fire 
safety experts to ensure the safety of these 
properties in light of the fast developing 
circumstances. This activity was co-
ordinated with our Primary Fire Authority, 
the Avon Fire & Rescue Services, to ensure 
we implemented an appropriate and 
co-ordinated response. This resulted in us 
closing one of our properties (Sky Plaza in 
Leeds), removing the ACM cladding on 
two other properties (Waverly House, 
Bristol and Concept Place, Leeds) and 
working with the local fire services and fire 
safety experts on the right remedial plans 
for the others. 
Alongside this fire safety work, we also 
embarked on a bold student safety 
campaign. This targeted student fire 
safety, alcohol awareness and student 
personal safety. More on this student 
safety campaign below.
Unite Students is home to 50,000 young 
people. For many, this is their first time 
living away from home. As such, it is 
crucial that health and safety is at the 
heart of everything we do to ensure the 
safety and wellbeing of all our customers, 
employees, contractors and other visitors 
to our properties. 
Sir Tim Wilson
Chair – Health and Safety Committee
Health and safety is 
a cornerstone of our 
business – providing 
quality , secure 
homes for our students. 
It came into even 
sharper focus in 201 7 
as we responded to 
the impact of the 
Grenfell Tower tragedy .

THE UNITE GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017
Corporate governance statement Committee overview
Composition
 - Sir Tim Wilson (Chair)
 - Elizabeth McMeikan
 - Richard Smith
Role
The role of the Health and Safety 
Committee is to:
 - Ensure that the Group’s Health and 
Safety policies and procedures are 
reviewed annually and effectively 
implemented to ensure legal 
requirements are met, as well as 
striving for best practice
 - Ensure that the business is aware of 
regulatory changes and understands 
the impact upon the business 
 - Remain updated on performance and 
any major health and safety incidents 
so as to ensure management identifies 
and implements appropriate 
corrective actions. 
Activities in 2017
Fire Safety
Following Grenfell and the heightened 
focus from regulatory authorities on fire 
safety, we carried out additional fire 
safety inspections of our properties 
and subsequently assembled a team 
to complete actions in light of learnings from 
the Grenfell Tower tragedy. In addition, we 
are working with The British Safety Council 
(our safety auditor) to obtain assurance of 
our end-to-end processes. Additional fire 
safety training is being carried out across all 
our teams, again building on the lessons 
learned from Grenfell. 
Student safety campaign
During 2017 , we launched a student 
safety campaign. This focused on fire 
safety, alcohol awareness and personal 
student safety.
The campaign was targeted to run soon 
after student check in and was co-
ordinated with local fire & rescue services 
and Police Community Service Officers.
The aim of the alcohol awareness 
campaign was harm reduction, with 
bottles of water provided to students 
on their way out to promote safe drinking 
and destigmatising drinking soft drinks on a 
night out. We ran a Student Personal Safety 
Week during the week of 2 October 2017 . 
We saw a marked reduction in alcohol 
and safety-related incidents via AIMS 
(our Accident and Incident 
Management system).
External audit
In addition to fire safety experts, we also 
work with The British Safety Council to 
provide independent external assurance 
on our health and safety effectiveness. 
During 2017 , The British Safety Council 
completed an Interim Review of their 
2016 ‘Five Star Occupational H&S Audit’. 
The primary objective of this interim review 
was to determine the progress made by 
the organisation in respect of areas that 
required ‘significant’ improvements. The 
review was carried out through a desktop-
based process which involved detailed 
discussion with the Health and Safety team 
and sampling of relevant documentation. 
This review showed we are making steady 
improvements in our Health and Safety 
Management System and safety culture; 
however there are still several areas that 
require attention in order to see an 
increase in the score for the next audit, 
scheduled for May 2018.

THE UNITE GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 ACCOUNTABILITY: HEALTH & SAFETY COMMITTEE REPORT CONTINUED
Incidents
Incidents involving our employees, 
customers or visitors: 
 - Five reportable injuries (under RIDDOR) 
involving employees and customers 
(classed as members of the public)
 - 310 minor (non-reportable) incidents - 
involving employees, customers and 
contractors.
In our development activity during 2017 , 
there were four RIDDOR reportable 
incidents and 13 minor incidents. This 
performance is within our Unite Students 
internal benchmarks – beating the 
industry standard – as follows:
Incidents KPI* Benchmark
4 RIDDOR 0.24 0.30
13 Minor 0.79 5.00
* KPI calculated as: No. of incidents worked x 
100,000 hours/hours worked 
1.6 million hours worked delivering positive 
results against our KPIs.
Priorities for 2018
Fire safety 
Fire safety continues to be a priority across 
the business. Our existing fire training 
offering has been improved with renewed 
fire safety e-learning and classroom style 
training for our employees. The Health and 
Safety team are working closely with the 
Estates team and City teams to ensure any 
remedial work highlighted in Fire Risk 
Assessments and Health and Safety 
Inspections are completed within 
designated timescales. 
Crisis management
During the year, we refreshed 
our crisis management procedures, 
including our Crisis Management Plan, 
Incident Management Plan and Crisis 
Communications Plan to ensure they keep 
up to date with emerging threats and risks. 
As part of this refresh, we also conducted 
some live crisis management tests, both in 
our head office in Bristol and in another 
city, to really challenge the effectiveness 
and resilience of our crisis management 
procedures. This provided some valuable 
learnings. We will continue to run crisis 
management tests with different scenarios, 
to help us prepare as best as possible for 
crisis events. We are also including our city 
team Supervisors and ECC (Emergency 
Contact Centre) teams in the next roll-out 
of training on the procedures. 
Mental health and wellbeing 
Mental health issues are an increasing 
concern for the Higher Education sector 
and also to us at Unite, especially since we 
are home to so many young people while 
they are at University. Employees receive 
mental health first-aid training to look for 
signs and signpost help. The student 
support services team provide support to 
employees and students alike and work 
closely with University support teams.
Employee wellness
This year will see a focus on employee 
wellness including a renewed approach 
to DSE (Display Screen Equipment) training 
and workplace assessments. We have also 
proposed a series of employee health and 
wellbeing initiatives in a joint campaign 
with the HR team.
Asbestos and water hygiene
The Health and Safety team, alongside 
the Estates team, will be updating our 
Water Hygiene procedures, training and 
assessments. The Group Asbestos Register 
is also being reviewed and employees will 
receive training on any asbestos hazards 
present in their properties. 
Accident and incident reporting
We will conduct a review of our AIMS 
(Accident and Incident Management 
System) to ensure we are using the most 
effective system to capture accident and 
incident-related information required by 
the business. We will also roll-out training to 
city teams that focuses on the accuracy 
of reporting and the importance of 
thorough accident/incident investigation. 
Upskilling of City team supervisors
Our City team supervisors will receive 
training on our incident management 
plans and dealing with the ‘scene’ of an 
incident. In addition to this, our service 
and safety supervisors will receive conflict 
management training and counter-
terrorism awareness training.

THE UNITE GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017
Corporate governance statement ANNUAL STATEMENT OF THE CHAIR OF THE REMUNERATION COMMITTEE
Dear Shareholder,
On behalf of the Board, it is my pleasure 
to present the Directors’ Remuneration 
Report for 2017 . 
As in previous years, this report is split 
into three sections: this Annual Statement, 
the Policy Report and the Annual Report 
on Remuneration. Our remuneration 
policy, detailed on pages 79 to 85, 
remains consistent with that approved by 
shareholders at the last binding vote at the 
2016 AGM, and is reproduced in full for both 
ease of reference and in order to provide 
context to the decisions taken by the 
Committee during the year.
As evidenced by the operational and 
financial highlights earlier in this report, 2017 
was another strong year for Unite. Financial 
performance was headlined by 7% and 
1 1% increases in EPRA EPS and NAV 
respectively, with a further reduction in our 
LTV and 4.7 pence increase in our annual 
dividend. A £100 investment in Unite shares 
in December 2014 was worth £180 as at 
year end, far exceeding the £1 1 1 for a 
similar investment in the FTSE 350 Real 
Estate ‘Super Sector’ Index. From an 
operational perspective, both our 
customer satisfaction and Higher 
Education trust scores increased this 
year, leaving the Group well placed to 
achieve its stretching three-year targets 
in these areas.
In light of this, the Committee’s key 
decisions during the year related to the 
following areas:
Annual bonus outcomes for 
the financial year
Executive Directors will each receive 
bonuses of 63.6% of maximum opportunity 
in respect of 2017 performance. Overall 
bonus outcomes reflect solid financial 
performance by the Group and the 
contributions made by each of the 
Executive Directors over the last year.
The overall 2017 bonus outcome was 
above target, with strong financial 
performance under the Earnings Per 
Share (EPS) and Total Accounting Return 
(TAR) elements offset slightly by the net 
debt to EBITDA element coming in just in 
line with threshold. On the non-financial 
element, performance under both the 
customer satisfaction measure and the 
newly introduced University reputation 
measure was in line with plan – a strong 
outcome against what the Committee 
recognises as particularly stretching 
targets. Finally, and reflecting significant 
progress in their new and expanded roles, 
each Executive Director was rated as 
‘Above Target’ for the purposes of the 
personal performance multiplier (1.1x cf. 
the maximum 1.2x multiplier).
Further details, including annual bonus 
targets, outcomes and details of personal 
achievements, are included on page 78.
Ensuring Directors’ 
remuneration is 
aligned to the 
performance 
of the business 
and shareholders’ 
interests.

THE UNITE GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 ANNUAL STATEMENT OF THE CHAIR OF THE REMUNERATION COMMITTEE CONTINUED
Overall pay for 2017
The Committee is satisfied that overall 
pay outcomes are appropriate and 
reflect Unite’s performance across the 
various time horizons covered. Fixed pay 
levels are competitive but not excessive 
when taking into account similar roles 
at comparable companies, individual 
contributions, experience and overall 
levels of responsibility. Annual bonus 
outcomes reflect another solid year, 
with strong financial, operational and 
individual performance leading to an 
overall outcome of 63.6% of maximum. 
This compares favourably with 2016 (43.4% 
of maximum) but is below the outcomes in 
2013, 2014 and 2015, which the Committee 
believes is appropriate taking all factors 
into account. Vesting of the 2015 LTIP – 
which constitutes the largest part of 
each Executive Director’s single figure 
for the year – reflects strong financial 
and operational performance, and 
further significant value creation over 
the three-year measurement period.
Implementation of policy for 2018
The Committee has reviewed the current 
remuneration policy and is confident that 
it continues to effectively support Unite’s 
short- and long-term strategic objectives 
and promote management and 
shareholder alignment. 
Long-term incentives
Executive Directors were each granted an 
award under the LTIP in April 2017 based 
on performance over the three financial 
years to 31 December 2019. These awards 
will vest to the extent that challenging EPS, 
TAR and relative Total Shareholder Return 
(TSR) targets are achieved over the period, 
with any award vesting required to be 
held for an additional two-year period.
Performance share awards made 
in April 2015 vested on performance 
to 31 December 2017 . These awards 
were similarly based on EPS, TAR and 
TSR outperformance of the FTSE 350 
Real Estate ‘Super Sector’ Index. Over 
the three-year performance period, the 
Company exceeded maximum targets 
for the relative TSR and TAR elements and 
ended just under the stretch target for 
the EPS element, resulting in 96.14% of the 
original award vesting. The Committee is 
satisfied that this vesting level reflects the 
underlying performance of the Company 
and the progress made over the last three 
years. Consistent with the rules of the plan 
at the time of grant, these awards shares 
will vest in tranches with two-thirds released 
on the third anniversary of grant in April 
2018, and the remaining one-third being 
released after a further year-long holding 
period. This is the final LTIP award 
outstanding which is subject to this 
phased vesting approach, with all 
subsequent awards subject to the 
mandatory two-year holding period 
introduced during the last policy review.
For 2018, the annual bonus will operate 
on the same basis as last year, with a 
maximum opportunity of 144% of salary 
and performance assessed against a 
corporate scorecard of key financial and 
non-financial measures and an individual 
performance multiplier. The operation of 
the LTIP will be similarly unchanged, with 
awards of 200% of salary vesting based on 
stretching three-year EPS, TAR and relative 
TSR targets and a mandatory two-year 
holding period applying.
Further details, including proposed 
salary and fee increases, are included 
on page 83.
Areas for future consideration
The 2019 AGM will mark the third 
anniversary of the adoption of the 
current Directors’ Remuneration Policy 
and, in line with UK reporting regulations, 
Unite will need to submit a new Policy 
to shareholders for approval at this time. 
Given this, the Committee is planning 
to conduct a full review of the existing 
remuneration arrangements over the 
course of the year and will look to engage 
major shareholders to seek their input in 
due course. The review will take into 
account recent market trends and 
developments in best practice, with the 
ultimate aim of ensuring the Company’s 
remuneration arrangements are able to 
attract, motivate and retain executives of 
the calibre required to continue to deliver 
against Unite’s longer-term strategy.

Corporate governance statement DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION POLICY
This report has been prepared in 
accordance with the provisions of the 
Companies Act 2006 and Schedule 8 of 
the Large and Medium-sized Companies 
and Groups (Accounts and Reports) 
Regulations 2008 (as amended). It also 
meets the requirements of the UK Listing 
Authority’s Listing Rules and the Disclosure 
and Transparency Rules.
In accordance with the Regulations, the 
following sections of the Remuneration 
Report are subject to audit: the single total 
figure of remuneration for Directors and 
accompanying notes (pages 87 to 95), 
scheme interests awarded during the 
financial year (page 90), payments to past 
directors (page 91), payments for loss of 
office (page 79) and the statement of 
directors’ shareholdings and share 
interests (pages 93 to 95). The remaining 
sections of the report are not subject 
to audit.
Unite’s Remuneration Policy was 
approved by shareholders at the 2016 
AGM on 12 May 2016. The report below, 
save for a number of minor changes, 
is as disclosed in the 2016 Directors’ 
Remuneration Report, which is available 
to download from the Company’s website 
at www.unite-group.co.uk/investors. The 
following changes have been made:
 - References to financial years have 
been updated where appropriate
 - Pay for performance scenario charts 
have been updated to reflect 2018 
salaries
 - Current Non-Executive Director 
appointment expiry dates have 
been updated
Directors’ Remuneration Policy
The Group aims to balance the need 
to attract, retain and motivate Executive 
Directors and other senior executives of 
an appropriate calibre with the need to 
be cost effective, while at the same time 
rewarding exceptional performance. The 
Committee has designed a remuneration 
policy that balances those factors, taking 
account of prevailing best practice, 
investor expectations and the level of 
remuneration and pay awards made 
generally to employees of the Group.
In addition to the above, the remuneration 
policy for the Executive Directors and 
other senior executives is based on the 
following key principles:
 - A significant proportion of 
remuneration should be tied to the 
achievement of specific and stretching 
performance conditions that align 
remuneration with the creation of 
shareholder value and the delivery 
of the Group’s strategic plans
 - There should be a focus on sustained 
long-term performance, with 
performance measured over clearly 
specified timescales, encouraging 
executives to take action in line with 
the Group’s strategic plan, using good 
business management principles and 
taking well-considered risks
 - Individuals should be rewarded for 
success, but steps should be taken, 
within contractual obligations, to 
prevent rewards for failure.
This section of the report sets out the Policy 
for Executive Directors which shareholders 
approved at the 2016 AGM and which 
came into effect from that date.

Function Operation Opportunity
Performance 
metrics
Base salary
To recognise the 
individual’s skills 
and experience 
and to provide 
a competitive 
base reward.
Base salaries are reviewed from 
time to time, with reference to 
salary levels for similar roles at 
comparable companies
1
, to 
individual contribution to 
performance, and to the 
experience of each Executive.
Any base salary increases are applied in line with 
the outcome of the review as part of which the 
Committee also considers average increases 
across the Group.
In respect of existing Executive Directors, it is 
anticipated that salary increases will generally be 
in line with those of salaried employees as a 
whole. In exceptional circumstances (including, 
but not limited to, a material increase in job size or 
complexity), the Committee has discretion to 
make appropriate adjustments to salary levels to 
ensure that they remain market competitive. This 
was the case for salary increases awarded during 
the course of 2016.
None
Pension
To provide an 
opportunity for 
executives to build 
up income upon 
retirement.
All Executive Directors are either 
members of the Unite Group 
Personal Pension scheme or 
receive a cash pension allowance.
Salary is the only element of 
remuneration that is pensionable.
Executive Directors receive a pension contribution 
of 20% of salary or an equivalent cash allowance.
None
Benefits
To provide non-cash 
benefits which are 
competitive in the 
market in which the 
executive is 
employed.
Executive Directors receive 
benefits which consist primarily 
of the provision of a company 
car or a car allowance, and 
private health care insurance, 
although can include any such 
benefits that the Committee 
deems appropriate.
Benefits vary by role and individual circumstances; 
eligibility and cost are reviewed periodically.
The Committee retains the discretion to approve a 
higher cost in certain circumstances (e.g. 
relocation) or in circumstances where factors 
outside the company’s control have changed 
materially (e.g. increases in insurance premiums).
None

To encourage the 
ownership of shares 
in Unite.
An HMRC approved scheme 
whereby employees (including 
Executive Directors) may save up 
to the maximum monthly savings

Performance 
related 
annual bonus
To incentivise and 
reward strong 
performance 
against financial 
and non-financial 
annual targets, thus 
delivering value to 
shareholders and 
being consistent 
with the delivery of 
the strategic plan.
Performance measures, 
targets and weightings are 
set at the start of the year.
The scheme has two 
elements: a ‘corporate’ 
element and an ‘individual’ 
multiplier element. At the end 
of the year, the Remuneration 
Committee determines the 
extent to which targets have 
been achieved.
Bonus payments are 
delivered in cash unless 
an individual’s shareholding 
requirements have not been 
met, in which case up to 50% 
of the annual bonus payable 
to the relevant Executive 
Director is satisfied by an 
allocation of shares in the 
Company, which are held in 
its Employee Share 
Ownership Trust.
Awards under the 
Performance Related 
Annual Bonus are subject to 
malus and clawback 
provisions, further details of 
which are included as a 
note to the policy table.
For Executive Directors, the 
maximum annual bonus 
opportunity is 144% of base 
salary, comprising:
 - A maximum bonus under 
the corporate element of 
120% of salary; achieving 
on-target performance 
warrants a bonus 
equivalent to 70% 
of salary.
 - A maximum multiplier 
under the individual 
element of 1.2, with a 
range of 0 to 1.2.
For Threshold level 
performance, the bonus will 
be 50% of base salary.
Performance is assessed on an annual basis, 
as measured against specific objectives set at the 
start of each year. The measures typically include 
both financial and non-financial metrics as well as 
the achievement of personal objectives.
Corporate measures will be weighted appropriately 
each year according to business priorities. Measures 
may include, but are not limited to, adjusted EPS, Total 
Accounting Return growth, the ratio of net debt to 
EBITDA and customer satisfaction. Weightings of 
individual measures may vary between 10% and 50%, 
with the range of performance required under each 
measure calibrated with reference to Unite’s internal 
budgets. Financial measures will make up at least 75% 
of the total opportunity under the corporate element.
The individual element is based on the Committee’s 
assessment of an Executive Directors’ personal 
performance over the course of the year, as measured 
by the Performance Development Programme review.
The Committee has discretion to adjust the formulaic 
bonus outcomes both upwards (within the plan limits) 
and downwards (including down to zero) to ensure 
alignment of pay with performance, e.g. in the event of 
one of the targets under the bonus being significantly 
missed or unforeseen circumstances outside 
management control. The Committee also considers 
measures outside the bonus framework (e.g. H&S) to 
ensure there is no reward for failure.
Further details of the measures, weightings and targets 
applicable are provided on pages 81, 87 and 91.
LTIP
To drive sustained 
long-term 
performance that 
supports the 
creation of 
shareholder value.
The LTIP comprises a 
Performance Share Plan 
(PSP) and an approved 
Employee Share Option 
Scheme (ESOS).
The ESOS is used to deliver 
a proportion of the LTIP 
in a tax-efficient manner, 
and is subject to the same 
performance conditions as 
awards made under the PSP.
Award levels and 
performance conditions are 
reviewed before each award 
cycle to ensure they remain 
appropriate and no less 
stretching than the first cycle.
Awards under the LTIP 
are subject to malus and 
clawback provisions, further 
details of which are included 
as a note to the policy table.
The LTIP provides for an 
award up to a normal 
aggregate limit of 200% of 
salary for Executive Directors, 
with an overall limit of 300% 
of salary in exceptional 
circumstances. The current 
intention is to award each 
Executive Director awards 
equivalent to 200% of salary.
Awards may include a grant 
of HMRC approved options 
not exceeding £10,000 per 
annum, valued on a fair 
value exchange (currently 
50–60% of a PSP award).
A payment equal to the 
value of dividends which 
would have accrued on 
vested shares will be made 
following the release of 
awards to participants, 
either in the form of cash 
or as additional shares.
Vesting of LTIP awards is subject to continued 
employment and performance against three equally-
weighted measures, which are currently as follows:
 - Adjusted Earnings per Share (EPS)
 - Total Accounting Return (TAR) and
 - Relative Total Shareholder Return (TSR)
The Committee has the discretion to adjust the 
performance measures to ensure that they continue to 
be linked to the delivery of Company strategy.
Under each measure, threshold performance will result 
in 25% of maximum vesting for that element, rising on a 
straight-line basis to full vesting.
Awards made under the LTIP will have a performance 
period of at least three years and a minimum vesting 
period of three years. If no entitlement has been earned 
at the end of the relevant performance period, awards 
will lapse. A proportion of vested awards may, at the 
discretion of the Committee, be subject to a mandatory 
holding period following the end of a three-year vesting 
period. The Committee’s intention is that, under future 
LTIP cycles, all awards will be required to be held for an 
additional two-year period post-vesting.
As under the Performance Related Annual Bonus, 
the Committee has discretion to adjust the formulaic 
LTIP outcomes to ensure alignment of pay with 
performance, i.e. to ensure the outcome is a true 
reflection of the performance of the company.
Details of the targets to be used in future LTIP grants are 
included in the Annual Report on Remuneration.

THE UNITE GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION POLICY CONTINUED
Notes to the policy table
The Committee is satisfied that the above 
remuneration policy is in the best interests 
of shareholders and does not promote 
excessive risk-taking. 
Performance measure selection and 
approach to target setting
Measures used under the Performance 
Related Annual Bonus and LTIP are 
selected annually to reflect the Group’s 
main short- and long-term objectives and 
reflect both financial and non-financial 
priorities, as appropriate. 
The Committee considers that EPS 
(used in both the short- and long-term 
incentive) is an objective and well-
accepted measure of the Company’s 
performance which reinforces the strategic 
objective of achieving profitable growth, 
while a focus on Total Accounting Return 
(also used in both the short- and long-term 
incentive) is consistent with one of our 
stated objectives and a key indicator of 
company performance in the real estate 
sector. The use of relative TSR is strongly 
aligned with shareholders and ensures 
that executives are rewarded only if they 
exceed the returns which an investor 
could achieve elsewhere in our sector. 
Targets applying to the Performance 
Related Annual Bonus and LTIP are 
reviewed annually, based on a number 
of internal and external reference 
points. Performance targets are set to 
be stretching but achievable, with regard 
to the particular strategic priorities and 
economic environment in a given year. 
Under the bonus, target performance 
typically requires meaningful improvement 
on the previous year’s outturn, and, for 
financial measures, targets are typically 
in line with the upper end of 
market consensus.
Remuneration Policy for other employees
Unite’s approach to annual salary 
reviews is consistent across the Group, 
with consideration given to the level 
of experience, responsibility, individual 
performance and salary levels in 
comparable companies. The 
Company is also now a fully 
accredited Living Wage employer.
In terms of variable incentives, all 
employees are eligible to participate in 
an annual bonus scheme with business 
area-specific metrics incorporated where 
appropriate. Senior managers are eligible 
to participate in the LTIP with annual 
awards currently up to 75% of salary. 
Performance conditions are consistent for 
all participants, while award sizes vary by 
level. Specific cash incentives are also in 
place to motivate, reward and retain staff 
below Board level. 
All employees are eligible to participate 
in the Company’s SAYE scheme on the 
same terms.
Shareholding guidelines
The Committee continues to recognise the 
importance of Executive Directors aligning 
their interests with shareholders through 
building up a significant shareholding in 
the Company. Shareholding guidelines are 
in place that require Executive Directors to 
acquire a holding (excluding shares that 
remain subject to performance conditions) 
equivalent to 250% of base salary for the 
Chief Executive and 200% of base salary 
for each of the other Executive Directors. 
Until the relevant shareholding levels are 
acquired, up to 50% of the annual bonus 
payable to the relevant Executive Director 
will be subject to deferral into shares and 
are transferable to the Executive Director 
after three years. Details of the Executive 
Directors’ current personal shareholdings 
are provided in the Annual Report 
on Remuneration.
Malus and clawback
Awards under the Performance Related 
Annual Bonus and the LTIP are subject to 
malus and, from 2016, clawback provisions 
which can be applied to both vested and 
unvested awards. Clawback provisions will 
apply for a period of at least two years 
post-vesting. Circumstances in which 
malus and clawback may be applied 
include a material misstatement of the 
Company’s financial accounts, gross 
misconduct on the part of the award-
holder and errors in calculating the 
award vesting outcome.

meeting in 2019 in the case of Andrew 
Jones, and at the annual general meeting 
in 2020 in the case of Elizabeth McMeikan 
and Sir Tim Wilson. The appointment and 
re-appointment and the remuneration of 
Non-Executive Directors are matters 
reserved for the full Board.
The Non-Executive Directors are not 
eligible to participate in the Company’s 
performance related bonus plan, 
long-term incentive plans or pension 
arrangements.

THE UNITE GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017
Corporate governance statement Details of the policy on fees paid to our Non-Executive Directors are set out in the table below: 
Function Operation Opportunity Performance metrics
Fees
To attract and retain Non-
Executive Directors of the 
highest calibre with broad 
commercial and other 
experience relevant to 
the Company.
Fee levels are reviewed 
annually, with any 
adjustments effective 
1 January in the year 
following review.
The fees paid to the 
Chairman are determined 
by the Committee, while the 
fees of the Non-Executive 
Directors are determined 
by the Board.
Additional fees are 
payable for acting as Senior 
Independent Director and 
as Chairman of any of the 
Board’s Committees (Audit, 
Remuneration, Nomination 
and Health & Safety).
Fee levels are benchmarked 
against sector comparators 
and FTSE-listed companies of 
similar size and complexity. 
Time commitment and 
responsibility are taken 
into account when 
reviewing fee levels.
Non-Executive Director 
fee increases are applied in 
line with the outcome of the 
annual fee review. Fees for the 
year commencing 1 January 
2018 are set out in the Annual 
Report on Remuneration.
Fee levels will be next 
reviewed during 2018, 
with any increase effective 
1 January 2019.
It is expected that increases 
to Non-Executive Director 
fee levels will be in line with 
salaried employees over the 
life of the policy. However, 
in the event that there is a 
material misalignment with 
the market or a change in the 
complexity, responsibility or 
time commitment required to 
fulfil a Non-Executive Director 
role, the Board has discretion 
to make an appropriate 
adjustment to the fee level.

Pay for performance scenarios
The charts below provide an illustration of the potential future reward opportunities for the Executive Directors, and the 
potential split between the different elements of remuneration under three different performance scenarios: ‘Minimum’, 
‘On-target’ and ‘Maximum’.
Potential reward opportunities are based on Unite’s remuneration policy, applied to the base salaries effective 1 March 2018. The 
annual bonus and LTIP are based on the maximum opportunities set out under the remuneration policy for normal circumstances, 
being 144% of salary and 200% of salary respectively. Note that the LTIP awards granted in a year do not normally vest until the third 
anniversary of the date of grant, and the projected value is based on the face value at award rather than vesting (i.e. the scenarios 
exclude the impact of any share price movement over the period).

THE UNITE GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION POLICY CONTINUED
Approach to recruitment remuneration
External appointment to the Board
In the cases of hiring or appointing a new Executive Director from outside the Company, the Remuneration Committee may make use 
of all the existing components of remuneration, as follows:
Component Approach Maximum annual grant 
value
Base salary The base salaries of new appointees will be determined by reference to relevant 
market data, experience and skills of the individual, internal relativities and their 
current basic salary. Where new appointees have initial basic salaries set below 
market, any shortfall may be managed with phased increases over a period of two 
to three years subject to the individual’s development in the role.
Pension New appointees will receive pension contributions or an equivalent cash 
supplement not greater than the existing policy.
Benefits New appointees will be eligible to receive benefits which may include (but are not 
limited to) the provision of a company car or cash alternative, private medical 
insurance and any necessary relocation expenses. New appointees will also be 
eligible to participate in all-employee share schemes.
SAYE
Performance related 
annual bonus
The structure described in the policy table will apply to new appointees with the 
relevant maximum being pro-rated to reflect the proportion of employment over the 
year. Targets for the individual element will be tailored to each executive.
144% of salary
LTIP New appointees will be granted awards under the LTIP on the same terms as other 
executives, as described in the policy table. The normal aggregate limit of 200% of 
salary will apply, save in exceptional circumstances, where up to 300% of salary 
may be awarded.
300% of salary
In determining appropriate remuneration, the Remuneration Committee will take into consideration all relevant factors (including 
quantum, nature of remuneration and the jurisdiction from which the candidate was recruited) to ensure that arrangements are in 
the best interests of both Unite and its shareholders. The Committee may make an award in respect of a new appointment to ‘buy out’ 
incentive arrangements forfeited on leaving a previous employer on a like-for-like basis, which may be awarded in addition to the 
remuneration structure outlined in the table above. In doing so, the Committee will consider relevant factors, including time to vesting, 
any performance conditions attached to these awards and the likelihood of those conditions being met. Any such ‘buy-out’ awards 
will typically be made under the existing annual bonus and LTIP schemes, although in exceptional circumstances the Committee may 
exercise the discretion available under Listing Rule 9.4.2 R to make awards using a different structure. Any ‘buy-out’ awards would 
have a fair value no higher than the awards forfeited.
Internal promotion to the Board
In cases of appointing a new Executive Director by way of internal promotion, the policy of the Remuneration Committee and Board 
will be consistent with the policy for external appointees detailed above. Where an individual has contractual commitments made 
prior to their promotion to Executive Director level, the Company will continue to honour these arrangements. The Remuneration 
policy for other employees is set out on page 82. Incentive opportunities for below Board employees are typically no higher than 
Executive Directors, but measures may vary to provide better line-of-sight.
Non-Executive Directors
In recruiting a new Non-Executive Director, the Remuneration Committee will utilise the policy as set out in the table on page 84. 
A base fee in line with the prevailing fee schedule would be payable for Board membership, with additional fees payable for acting 
as Senior Independent Director and/or as Chairman of the Board’s Committees. 
Service contracts and treatment for leavers and change of control
Executive Date of service contract
J J Lister 1 June 2016
R C Simpson 1 June 2016
R S Smith 1 June 2016
Executive Director service contracts, including arrangements for early termination, are carefully considered by the Committee. In 
accordance with general market practice, each of the Executive Directors has a rolling service contract requiring 12 months’ notice 
of termination on either side. Such contracts contain no specific provision for compensation for loss of office, other than an obligation 
to pay for any notice period waived by the Company, where pay is defined as salary, benefits and any other statutory payments only. 
Executive Director service contracts are available to view at the Company’s registered office.
84
THE UNITE GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017
Corporate governance statement The Remuneration Committee will exercise discretion in making appropriate payments in the context of outplacement, settling legal 
claims or potential legal claims by a departing Executive Director, including any other amounts reasonably due to the Executive 
Director, for example to meet the legal fees incurred by the Executive Director in connection with the termination of employment, 
where the Company wishes to enter into a settlement agreement and where the individual must seek independent legal advice.
When considering exit payments, the Committee reviews all potential incentive outcomes to ensure they are fair to both shareholders 
and participants. The table below summarises how the awards under the annual bonus and LTIP are typically treated in specific 
circumstances, with the final treatment remaining subject to the Committee’s discretion:
Reason for leaving Calculation of vesting/payment
Annual bonus
Resignation No annual bonus payable.
‘Good’ leaver
1
Cash bonuses will only be paid to the extent that financial and individual objectives set at the beginning 
of the plan year have been met. Any resulting bonus will be pro-rated for time served during the year.
Change of control
LTIP
Resignation Outstanding awards lapse.
‘Good’ leaver
1
The Committee determines whether and to what extent outstanding awards vest based on the extent to 
which performance conditions have been achieved and the proportion of the vesting period worked.
The determination of vesting will be made as soon as reasonably practical following the end of the 
performance period or such earlier date as the Committee may agree (within 12 months in the 
event of death).
In the event of a change of control, Unite awards may alternatively be exchanged for new 
equivalent awards in the acquirer where appropriate.
Change of control
1 ‘Good leaver’ is defined as a participant ceasing to be employed by the Group by reason of death, disability, ill health, redundancy, retirement or any other 
reason that the Committee determines in its absolute discretion.
The treatment of shares subject to deferral 
or holding periods will be subject to the 
Remuneration Committee’s discretion and 
will take into account the circumstances 
at the time.
External appointments 
With the approval of the Board 
in each case, and subject to the 
overriding requirements of the Group, 
Executive Directors may accept external 
appointments as Non-Executive Directors 
of other companies and retain any fees 
received. Joe Lister is currently a member 
of the Council of the University of Essex for 
which he does not receive a fee. Richard 
Simpson is on the Board of CityWest Homes 
for which he receives a fee of £3,500. 
Richard Smith does not currently hold 
an external appointment.
Consideration of conditions elsewhere 
in the Company
When making decisions on Executive 
Director remuneration, the Committee 
considers pay and conditions across Unite. 
Prior to the annual salary review, the 
Group People Director provides the 
Committee with a summary of the 
proposed level of increase for overall 
employee pay. The Remuneration 
Committee does not formally consult 
with employees on the executive 
remuneration policy and framework. 
Consideration of shareholder views 
The Remuneration Committee 
maintains a regular dialogue with its 
major shareholders, and consulted with 
investors representing around two-thirds 
of Unite’s issued share capital in forming 
the existing remuneration policy. The 
Committee will continue to monitor 
trends and developments in corporate 
governance and market practice to 
ensure the structure of the executive 
remuneration remains appropriate.

of £15,000 for Messrs Smith, Lister and Simpson. 
2 Pension figures include contributions to the Unite Group Personal Pension Scheme and cash allowances, where applicable. 
3 Payment for performance during the year. Having already reached their share ownership guidelines, each Executive Director will receive 100% of their 2017 
bonus award in cash. 
4 2016 figures: LTIP awards granted in 2014, and which vested based on performance to 31 December 2016, are valued using the market price at the date of 
vesting (10 April 2017) of 642.0 pence. These amounts have been revised from last year’s report to reflect the actual share prices on the dates of vesting. 2017 
figures: For the 2015 awards, the market price on the date of vesting is currently unknown and so the value shown is estimated using the average market value 
over the last quarter of 2017 of 727.9 pence. See following sections for further details. For both 2016 and 2017, LTIP figures include cash payments in lieu of 
dividends for vested awards. Awards in the form of HMRC approved options are valued based on the embedded gain at vesting (i.e. subtracting the 
applicable exercise price).
5 ‘Other’ includes the embedded value of SAYE options at grant.

Incentive outcomes for the year ended 31 December 2017 (audited)
Performance related annual bonus in respect of 2017 performance
The 2017 annual bonus consists of two elements, corporate and individual. The corporate element of the bonus is calculated on a 
sliding scale up to a maximum of 120% of base salary, in accordance with which ‘on target’ performance by the Group results in a 
corporate bonus of an amount equivalent to 70% of base salary. To determine the actual bonus payment to an Executive Director, 
a multiplier (being the ‘individual’ element of the scheme), ranging between 0 and 1.2, is applied against the corporate bonus. 
Applying the maximum individual multiplier (of 1.2), against the maximum corporate bonus (of 120% of base salary), results in a maximum 
annual performance related bonus opportunity of 144% of base salary. However, bonus payments at that level would only be made 
subject to the achievement of extremely stretching corporate performance targets and exceptional individual performance by the 
relevant Executive Director. Target performance typically requires meaningful improvement on the previous year’s outturn, and for 
financial measures, targets are typically in line with the upper end of market consensus.
The performance related bonuses awarded in respect of 2017 reflect corporate bonuses of 83.2% of base salary. After applying 
individual multipliers, actual performance related bonus payments awarded to the Executive Directors were 63.6% of their maximum 
bonus opportunities. Further details, including the targets set and performance against each of the metrics, are provided in the 
following tables.

The individual element of the 2017 annual bonus saw greater emphasis on shared objectives, reflecting the reshaped executive 
team’s collaborative ethos. Against these stretching objectives, the Committee considers that Executive Directors continued to 
develop strongly in their new and expanded roles, particularly in light of a number of external challenges throughout the year.

The Committee is satisfied that the overall bonus outcomes are appropriate. 2017 financial performance was strong, evidenced in 
particular by the above-target EPS and TAR performances, while against both the customer satisfaction measure and the newly 
introduced University reputation measure, the Group delivered in line with its stretching plan and remains on track to achieve its longer-
term goals. An overall bonus outcome of 63.6% of maximum is an improvement on 2016, which the Committee feels is appropriate taking 
into account the underlying performance of the Group and the strong individual progress of our Executive Directors.
Having already reached their respective share ownership guidelines, each Executive Director will receive 100% of their bonus 
awards in cash.

Corporate governance statement 2015 LTIP vesting (vested on performance to 31 December 2017)
Awards in 2015 were made under the new LTIP , consisting of the Unite Group plc Performance Share Plan and the Unite Group plc 
Approved Employee Share Option Scheme. Vesting of the awards was dependent on three equally weighted measures over a 
three-year performance period: Total Accounting Return per share, Earnings Per Share and TSR outperformance of the FTSE 350 Real 
Estate ‘Super Sector’ Index. There was no retest provision. Further details, including vesting schedules and performance against each 
of the metrics are provided in the table below:

In line with regulations, the value disclosed above and in the single total figure of remuneration table on page 78 captures the 
full number of interests vesting (i.e. excluding the one-year holding period). As the market price on the date of vesting is unknown 
at the time of reporting, the value is estimated using the average market value over the last quarter of 2017 of 727 .9 pence. The actual 
value at vesting will be trued-up in the 2018 Annual Report on Remuneration. Executives also became entitled to cash in lieu of the 
dividends payable on vested LTIP shares over the three-year performance period. These payments are included in the row entitled 
‘LTIP’ in the single total figure of remuneration table on page 78, and amounted to £30,082, £33,360 and £30,082 for Messrs Smith, 
Lister and Simpson respectively.
Percentage change in CEO remuneration
The table below shows the percentage change in CEO remuneration from the prior year compared with the average percentage 
change in remuneration for all employees.
The CEO’s remuneration includes base salary, taxable benefit and annual bonus and for 2016 is calculated as an aggregate of 
the remuneration of Mark Allan until 31 May 2016 and of Richard Smith thereafter (annual bonus relates to Richard Smith full year). 
The pay for all other employees is calculated using the increase in the earnings of full-time employees for tax years 2016 and 2017 . 
The analysis excludes part-time employees and is based on a consistent set of employees, i.e. the same individuals appear in the 
2016 and 2017 populations.

Review of past performance
The following graph charts the TSR of the Company and the FTSE 350 Real Estate ‘Super Sector’ Index over the nine-year period from 
1 January 2009 to 31 December 2017 . While there is no comparator index or group of companies that truly reflects the activities of the 
Group, the FTSE 350 Real Estate ‘Super Sector’ Index (the constituent members of which are all property holding and/or development 
companies or real estate investment trusts within the UK) was chosen as it reflects trends within the UK property market generally and 
tends to be the index against which analysts judge the performance of the Company. The table below details the Chief Executive’s

Exit payments made in the year (audited)
As disclosed in last year’s report, as part of the leaver arrangements for former Chief Executive, Mark Allan, the Committee preserved 
the first two-thirds of his 2013 LTIP award (which vested in full based on performance to 31 December 2015). These awards became 
capable of exercise on 1 April 2017 , being an increased deferral period from the original vesting date, with the resultant value on that 
date shown below.

THE UNITE GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 ANNUAL REPORT ON REMUNERATION CONTINUED
The Performance Related Annual Bonus for the 2018 financial year will operate on the same basis as in 2017 . The Committee has 
approved a maximum bonus opportunity for each executive of 144% of salary, consisting of a maximum of 120% of salary under the 
‘corporate’ element and a maximum individual multiplier of 1.2x.
For 2018, the ‘corporate’ element of the annual bonus will continue to be based on a combination of financial and non-financial 
measures, weighted 75% and 25% respectively. University Reputation, which was included in the annual bonus for the first time in 2017 , will 
maintain a 12.5% weighting. As with last year’s bonus, it is intended that the majority of 2018 objectives under the individual performance 
multiplier will be shared across each of the Executive Directors. Proposed target levels have been set to be challenging relative to business 
plan, although specific targets are deemed to be commercially sensitive at this time. It is the Committee’s current intention to disclose 
these targets, and the key achievements by each Executive Director, retrospectively in the 2018 Directors’ Remuneration Report. 
Annual bonuses will continue to be paid in cash, unless the recipient has not met their shareholding guidelines, in which case up to 
50% of the amount payable will be satisfied by an allocation of shares in the Company deferred for three years. Clawback and malus 
provisions apply to all awards.
LTIP
For 2018, the LTIP will continue to operate broadly on the same basis as in the 2017 financial year. The Committee, having considered 
the performance of the Company and other relevant factors, intends that Executive Directors will each receive an award equivalent 
to a maximum of 200% of salary delivered through a combination of the PSP and ESOS, with the final level of vesting dependent on 
the achievement of three-year performance targets relating to EPS, TAR and TSR, as follows:
Measure Weighting Targets
2020 Adjusted Earnings Per Share (EPS) 1/3
0% vesting below 40 pence
25% vesting for 40 pence
100% vesting for 46 pence or more
Straight-line vesting between these points.

0% vesting below 7% p.a.
25% vesting for 7% p.a.

Estate ‘Super Sector’ Index (2018–2020)
1/3
0% vesting if Group underperforms the Index
25% vesting for matching the Index
100% vesting for outperforming Index by 9% p.a.
Straight-line vesting between these points.
Targets have been set with reference to internal and external reference points, including our strategic plan and broker consensus 
estimates, and are designed to be stretching but achievable for participants. Full vesting under each element will require continued 
exceptional performance over the next three years. Any awards vesting for performance will be subject to an additional two-year 
holding period, during which time clawback provisions will also apply. Further details of the grant date and number of interests 
awarded will be disclosed in the 2018 Annual Report on Remuneration.
Implementation of Non-Executive Director Remuneration Policy for 2018
Chairman and Non-Executive Director fees
During the final quarter of 2017 , the Board undertook its annual review of Non-Executive Director fees. Following consideration 
of salary increases across the Group and indicative fee increases at sector and FTSE comparators, the Board determined that the 
basic fee should be increased from £45,900 p.a. to £46,800 p.a. and that additional fees should be increased by a similar rate. The 
Committee, in considering similar factors, determined that the fee payable to the Chairman of the Board should be increased from 
£185,000 to £188,700. Each of these fee increases is in line with increases applied to the broader employee population.
A summary of the fee increases, which are effective 1 January 2018, is set out in the table below.

The Company is not aware of any 
agreements between shareholders that 
may result in restrictions on the transfers of 
securities and/or voting rights. No person 
holds securities in the Company carrying 
special rights with regard to control of the 
Company. Unless expressly specified to 
the contrary, the Company’s articles of 
association may be amended by special

exercisable on a change of control, subject 
to the satisfaction of any performance 
conditions. Other than certain of the 
Group’s banking facilities, there are no 
other significant agreements to which the 
Company is a party that affect, alter or 
terminate upon a change of control of 
the Company following a takeover 
bid. Nor are there any agreements 
between the Company and its Directors 
or employees providing for compensation 
for loss of office or employment that occurs 
because of a takeover bid.
The Directors have no authority to 
buy-back the Company’s shares.

THE UNITE GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017
Corporate governance statement Resolution 4: Scrip Dividend Scheme
In addition to the ordinary business of the 
meeting, the Directors wish to offer 
shareholders the option of receiving 
ordinary shares, credited as fully paid, 
instead of cash in respect of the whole (or 
part, as determined by the Directors) of 
any dividend declared (‘Scrip Dividend 
Scheme’). Shareholders who elect to 
participate in the Scrip Dividend Scheme 
will be able to increase their shareholding 
in the Company without incurring dealing 
costs or stamp duty. The Scrip Dividend 
Scheme also gives the Company greater 
flexibility in managing its capital resources 
by retaining cash in the business which 
would otherwise be paid out as 
a dividend.
Article 142 of the Company’s articles of 
association permits the provision of this 
scrip dividend alternative, as long as it is 
authorised by an ordinary resolution of 
the Company, and Resolution 4 seeks 
this authorisation. Under the articles of 
association, this authorisation may be for a 
period of up to five years from the date of 
such authorisation, and may be in respect 
of dividends declared during the period 
starting on the date of the authorisation 
and ending at the beginning of the fifth 
Annual General Meeting of the Company 
following such authorisation. In line with 
investor protection guidelines, the authority 
contained in Resolution 4 is sought for three 
years and starting on the date of the 
authorisation and ending at the beginning 
of the third Annual General Meeting of the 
Company following such authorisation.
In accordance with Article 142(b) of the 
articles of association, the entitlement of 
each shareholder to receive new ordinary 
shares under the Scrip Dividend Scheme 
shall be such that the relevant value of 
the entitlement shall be nearly as possible 
equal to the cash amount that such 
shareholder would have received by way 
of dividend. For these purposes, ‘relevant 
value’ would have the same meaning as 
in the articles of association, and shall be 
calculated by reference to the average 
of the middle market quotations for the 
ordinary shares on the London Stock 
Exchange as derived from the Daily 
Official List, for the day on which the 
ordinary shares are first quoted ‘ex’ the 
relevant dividend and the four subsequent 
dealing days, or in such other manner as 
the Directors may determine on such basis 
as it considers to be fair and reasonable. 
The articles of association permit this, as 
long as it is authorised by an ordinary 
resolution of the Company.
Full details of the terms and conditions 
of the Scrip Dividend Scheme and 
instructions on how to participate will be 
set out in a shareholder circular and guide.
Resolution 15: Authority to allot shares
Resolution 15 will be proposed as an 
ordinary resolution to grant the Directors 
authority to allot shares in the Company, 
and grant rights to subscribe for, or to 
convert, any security into shares of the 
Company, up to the aggregate amount 
stated in the Notice (which represents 
one-third of the nominal value of the 
issued share capital of the Company as 
at the date of the Notice). In accordance 
with guidelines issued by the Investment 
Association, this resolution also grants the 
Directors authority to allot further equity 
securities up to the aggregate amount 
stated in the Notice (which represents 
one-third of the nominal value of the 
issued share capital of the Company as 
at the date of the Notice). This additional 
authority may only be applied to fully 
pre-emptive rights issues.
Resolutions 16 and 17: Disapplication of 
pre-emption rights resolutions
If the Directors wish to allot new shares and 
other equity securities for cash (other than 
in connection with an employee share 
scheme), company law requires that these 
shares are offered first to the shareholders, 
in proportion to their existing holdings. The 
Directors consider it desirable to have the 
maximum flexibility permitted by corporate 
governance guidelines to respond to 
market developments and to enable 
allotments to take place to finance 
business opportunities without making a 
pre-emptive offer to existing shareholders. 
This cannot be done under the Companies 
Act 2006 unless the shareholders have first 
waived their pre-emption rights. The 
purpose of Resolutions 16 and 17 (together 
the ‘disapplication of pre-emptions rights 
resolutions’) is to enable shareholders to so 
waive their pre-emption rights. 
Resolution 16 authorises the Directors to 
allot new shares pursuant to the authority 
given by Resolution 15 (the allotment 
resolution) for cash:
(a) in connection with a rights issue or 
pre-emptive issue; and/or
(b) otherwise up to the aggregate amount 
stated in the Notice (which represents 
5% of the nominal value of the issued 
share capital of the Company as at the 
date of the Notice),
in each case without the shares first being 
offered to existing shareholders in 
proportion to their existing holdings.
Resolution 17 additionally authorises 
the Directors to allot new shares for cash, 
without the shares first being offered to 
existing shareholders in proportion to their 
existing holdings, in connection with the 
financing (or refinancing, if the authority 
is to be used within six months of the 
original transaction) of an acquisition 
or specified capital investment which is 
announced contemporaneously with the 
allotment or which has taken place in 
the preceding six-month period and is 
disclosed in the announcement of the 
allotment. The authority under Resolution 17 
is limited to the aggregate amount stated 
in the Notice (which represents 5% of the 
nominal value of the issued share capital of 
the Company as at the date of the Notice).
Taken together, these disapplication 
of pre-emption rights resolutions will 
allow the Directors to issue new shares 
for cash without offering the shares first 
to existing shareholders in proportion 
to their existing holdings under the 
following circumstances:
 - in connection with a rights issue or 
other pre-emptive issue, with a nominal 
value equivalent to two-thirds of the 
issued share capital as at the date of 
the Notice (which will allow the 
Directors to make exclusions or such 
other arrangements as may be 
appropriate to resolve legal or 
practical problems which, for example, 
might arise with overseas shareholders);
 - for any other purpose, with a nominal 
value equivalent to 5% of the issued 
share capital as at the date of the 
Notice; and
 - in connection with the financing 
or refinancing of an acquisition or 
specified capital investment which is 
announced contemporaneously with 
the allotment or which has taken place 
in the preceding six-month period and 
is disclosed in the announcement of 
the allotment, with a nominal value 
equivalent to 5% of the issued share 
capital as at the date of the Notice, 
but subject to an overall aggregate 
limit equivalent to two-thirds of the 
issued share capital as at the date 
of the Notice.

THE UNITE GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 DIRECTORS’ REPORT CONTINUED
The Directors intend to adhere to the 
provisions in the Pre-Emption Group’s 
Statement of Principles, as updated in 
March 2015, and not to allot shares for cash 
on a non-pre-emptive basis pursuant to the 
authority in Resolution 16 either in excess of 
an amount equal to 5% of the total issued 
ordinary share capital of the Company or 
in excess of an amount equal to 7 .5% of the 
total issued ordinary share capital of the 
Company within a rolling three-year 
period, without prior consultation with 
shareholders. Adherence to the principles 
would not preclude issuances under the 
authority sought under Resolution 17 .
The allotment and the disapplication of 
pre-emption rights resolutions comply with 
the Share Capital Management Guidelines 
issued by the Investment Association in July 
2016 and the disapplication of pre-emption 
rights resolutions follow the resolution 
templates issued by the Pre-Emption 
Group in May 2016. 
If the resolutions are passed, the authorities 
will expire at the end of the next Annual 
General Meeting of the Company or, if 
earlier, 9 August 2019, this being the date 
15 months from the passing of the 
resolutions, whichever is the earlier.
Resolution 18: Notice of 
General Meetings
The Companies (Shareholders’ Rights) 
Regulations 2009 (‘the Shareholders’ Rights 
Regulations’), increased the notice period 
for General Meetings of the Company to 
21 days unless shareholders approve a 
shorter notice period, which cannot be 
less than 14 days. At the Annual General 
Meeting of the Company held in 2017 , 
shareholders authorised the calling of 
General Meetings, other than an Annual 
General Meeting, on not less than 14 days’ 
notice. Resolution 18 seeks the approval of 
shareholders to renew the authority to be 
able to call General Meetings (other than 
an Annual General Meeting) on 14 days’ 
notice. The flexibility offered by Resolution 
18 will be used where, taking into account 
the circumstances, the Directors consider it 
appropriate in relation to the business of 
the Meeting and in the interests of the 
Company and shareholders as a whole. 
The Company undertakes to meet the 
requirements for electronic voting under 
the Shareholders’ Rights Regulations before 
calling a General Meeting on 14 days’ 
notice. If given, the approval will be 
effective until the Company’s next Annual 
General Meeting, when it is intended that 
a similar resolution will be proposed.

Director
21 February 2018 
J Lister
Director
The Directors are responsible for preparing 
the Annual Report and Accounts and the 
Group and parent company financial 
statements in accordance with 
applicable law and regulations.
Company law requires the Directors to 
prepare Group and parent company 
financial statements for each financial 
year. Under that law they are required to 
prepare the Group financial statements in 
accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the 
EU and applicable law and have elected 
to prepare the parent company financial 
statements on the same basis.
Under company law, the Directors must 
not approve the financial statements 
unless they are satisfied that they give a 
true and fair view of the state of affairs of 
the Group and parent company and of 
their profit or loss for that period.
In preparing each of the Group and 
parent company financial statements, the 
Directors are required to:
 - Select suitable accounting policies 
and then apply them consistently
 - Make judgments and estimates that 
are reasonable and prudent
 - State whether they have been 
prepared in accordance with IFRSs 
as adopted by the EU
 - Prepare the financial statements on 
the going concern basis unless it is 
inappropriate to presume that the 
Group and the parent company will 
continue in business.
The Directors are responsible for keeping 
adequate accounting records that are 
sufficient to show and explain the parent 
company’s transactions and disclose with 
reasonable accuracy at any time the 
financial position of the parent company 
and enable them to ensure that its 
financial statements comply with the 
Companies Act 2006. They have general 
responsibility for taking such steps as are 
reasonably open to them to safeguard 
the assets of the Group and to prevent 
and detect fraud and other irregularities.

Report on the audit of the financial statements
Opinion
In our opinion:
 - the financial statements give a true and fair view of the state of the Group’s and of the parent company’s affairs as at 31 December 
2017 and of the Group’s profit for the year then ended;
 - the Group financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards 
(IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union;
 - the parent company financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European 
Union and as applied in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006; and
 - the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 and, as regards the 
Group financial statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation.
We have audited the financial statements of The Unite Group plc (the ‘parent company’) and its subsidiaries (the ‘Group’) 
which comprise:
 - the consolidated income statement;
 - the consolidated statement of comprehensive income;
 - the consolidated and parent company balance sheets;
 - the consolidated and parent company statements of changes in equity;
 - the consolidated and parent company statements of cash flow; and
 - the related sections 1 to 7 .
The financial reporting framework that has been applied in their preparation is applicable law and IFRSs as adopted by the 
European Union and, as regards the parent company financial statements, as applied in accordance with the provisions of the 
Companies Act 2006.
Basis for opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK) (ISAs (UK)) and applicable law. 
Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the 
financial statements section of our report. 
We are independent of the Group and the parent company in accordance with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our 
audit of the financial statements in the UK, including the FRC’s Ethical Standard as applied to listed public interest entities, and we 
have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements. We confirm that the non-audit services 
prohibited by the FRC’s Ethical Standard were not provided to the Group or the parent company.
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.
Summary of our audit approach
Key audit matters The key audit matters that we identified in the current year were:
 - Investment and development property valuation; 
 - Accounting for Joint Ventures; and
 - Real Estate Investment Trust (‘REIT’) compliance.
Within this report, any new key audit matters are identified with  and any key audit matters 
which are the same as the prior year identified with .
Last year our report included a key audit matter relating to the Group’s REIT transition; this is 
no longer relevant in the current year as the Group elected to become a REIT from 1 
January 2017. In the current year, we have a new key audit matter relating to the Group’s 
compliance with the REIT provisions as this is the first year that the Group is required to 
operate in accordance with the REIT regulations.
Materiality The materiality that we used for the Group financial statements was £17.5m which was 
determined on the basis of net assets. However, we use a lower threshold of £3.5m for 
balances which impact European Public Real Estate Association (‘EPRA’) earnings. 
Scoping Consistent with our approach in the prior year, our Group audit scope focussed on the 
audit work of The Unite Group plc as well as the Joint Ventures, The Unite UK Student 
Accommodation Fund (‘USAF’) and The London Student Accommodation Venture (‘LSAV’). 
All audit work was completed by the Group audit team. 
Significant changes 
in our approach
There have been no significant changes in our audit approach in the current year, with the 
exception of the key audit matter changes relating to REIT as set out in the ‘key audit 
matters’ section above. Strategic report Corporate governance Financial statements Other information 101
THE UNITE GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017
Conclusions relating to going concern, principal risks 
and viability statement
Going concern
We have reviewed the directors’ statement in Section 1 to the financial statements 
about whether they considered it appropriate to adopt the going concern basis of 
accounting in preparing them and their identification of any material uncertainties 
to the Group’s and company’s ability to continue to do so over a period of at least 
twelve months from the date of approval of the financial statements.
We are required to state whether we have anything material to add or draw 
attention to in relation to that statement required by Listing Rule 9.8.6R(3) and report 
if the statement is materially inconsistent with our knowledge obtained in the audit.
We confirm that we have nothing material 
to report, add or draw attention to in 
respect of these matters.
Principal risks and viability statement
Based solely on reading the directors’ statements and considering whether they 
were consistent with the knowledge we obtained in the course of the audit, 
including the knowledge obtained in the evaluation of the directors’ assessment 
of the Group’s and the company’s ability to continue as a going concern, we are 
required to state whether we have anything material to add or draw attention to 
in relation to:
 - the disclosures on pages 28–31 that describe the principal risks and explain how 
they are being managed or mitigated;
 - the directors’ confirmation on page 99 that they have carried out a robust 
assessment of the principal risks facing the Group, including those that would 
threaten its business model, future performance, solvency or liquidity; or
 - the directors’ explanation on page 27 as to how they have assessed the 
prospects of the Group, over what period they have done so and why they 
consider that period to be appropriate, and their statement as to whether they 
have a reasonable expectation that the Group will be able to continue in 
operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due over the period of their 
assessment, including any related disclosures drawing attention to any necessary 
qualifications or assumptions.
We are also required to report whether the directors’ statement relating to the 
prospects of the Group required by Listing Rule 9.8.6R(3) is materially inconsistent 
with our knowledge obtained in the audit.
We confirm that we have nothing material 
to report, add or draw attention to in 
respect of these matters.
Key audit matters
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement, were of most significance in our audit of the financial 
statements of the current period and include the most significant assessed risks of material misstatement (whether or not due to fraud) 
that we identified. These matters included those which had the greatest effect on: the overall audit strategy, the allocation of 
resources in the audit; and directing the efforts of the engagement team.
These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, 
and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.
Last year our report included a key audit matter relating to the Group’s REIT transition; this is no longer relevant in the current year as 
the Group elected to become a REIT from 1 January 2017 . In the current year, we have a new key audit matter relating to the Group’s 
compliance with the REIT provisions as this is the first year that the Group is required to operate in accordance with the REIT regulations. INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT TO THE

THE UNITE GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017
Financial statements
Investment property and development property valuation 
Key audit matter description The Group’s principal assets are investment properties (2017: £1,261.4m; 2016: £1,016.6m) 
and investment properties under development (2017: £205.7m; 2016: £184.6m). The Group 
also holds investments in the joint ventures, USAF and LSAV, whose principal assets are investment 
properties. The investment properties are carried at fair value based on an appraisal by the 
Group’s independent external valuers. Valuations are carried out at six-monthly intervals for the 
Group in accordance with the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (‘RICS’) Valuation – 
Professional Standards (the ‘Red Book’), taking into account transactional evidence during 
the year.
Management conduct a detailed exercise twice annually to assess the valuation of the Group’s 
property portfolio. The valuation is underpinned by a number of judgements and assumptions as it 
requires the estimation of property yields, rental growth, occupancy and property management 
costs. A small change in these assumptions could have a significant impact on the valuation of 
properties and there is an associated fraud risk due to the risk of management override of controls. 
With regards to the valuation of the USAF properties, small changes could also have a significant 
impact on a key input to the calculation of the performance fee recognised for the year ended 
31 December 2017 as this is based on the net asset value of the fund.
With regards to the investment properties under development, additional judgement is required 
to forecast discounted cash flows with a deduction for construction costs to complete.
Refer to page 69 (Audit Committee Statement) and section 3.1: Wholly owned property assets 
and section 3.4 Investments in joint ventures.
How the scope of our 
audit responded to the 
key audit matter
We performed testing on the property valuations and critically assessed the judgements and 
estimates that had been made. This work included:
 - Understanding and documenting the underlying business process and then evaluating 
the design, determining implementation and testing operating effectiveness of the 
relevant controls;
 - Understanding and challenging the assumptions taken in relation to key drivers such as rental 
income and growth, occupancy, yields and costs with reference to the trends at the end of 
the year and the following year’s budget;
 - Meeting with the Group’s valuers to understand the assumptions being taken and consistency 
of the judgements with prior year;
 - Working with our valuation experts within our Deloitte Real Estate team to benchmark the 
assumptions used against market data; and
 - Assessing the Group’s development appraisal process through meeting with the development 
team and assessing the forecast cost to complete against budget and substantive testing of 
costs incurred to date.
Key observations We are satisfied with the approach and methodology adopted in valuing the property 
portfolio and consider the valuations to be suitable for inclusion in the financial statements at 
31 December 2017. Strategic report Corporate governance Financial statements Other information 103
THE UNITE GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017
Accounting for Joint Ventures 
Key audit matter description A significant proportion of the Group’s assets is held within USAF and LSAV, jointly owned entities 
that are accounted for under the equity method as joint ventures (2017: £793.5m; 2016: £692.9m), 
on the basis that Unite does not control the entities. At 31 December 2017 Unite had a 24.6% 
(2016: 23.0%) ownership of USAF and 50.0% (2016: 50.0%) ownership of LSAV, and acts as manager 
of both joint venture vehicles.
Due to the complexity of the contractual arrangements, and the Group’s role as manager 
of the joint venture vehicles, the assessment of control involves judgements around a number 
of significant factors, particularly with regards to USAF given that it is a multi-investor fund and 
the Unite ownership stake is subject to change. In accordance with the requirements of IFRS, 
there is a need to assess control with regards to the ability to direct relevant activities, to have 
exposure to variable returns and the ability to use power to affect returns at each reporting period. 
Management have assessed (in line with the prior year) that Unite does not have control over USAF 
and LSAV, but has joint control. Consequently Management have accounted for the joint ventures 
under the equity method rather than consolidating them within the Group’s financial statements.
Refer to page 70 (Audit Committee Statement) and section 3.4: Investments in joint ventures
How the scope of our 
audit responded to the 
key audit matter
Our audit procedures on this area focussed on assessing the activities of the businesses, 
understanding the contractual agreements in place and identifying the methodology 
applied by Management in reaching their business decisions in order to consider the 
appropriateness of the classification of these arrangements as joint ventures in 
accordance with the requirements of IFRS.
With regards to both USAF and LSAV, we have:
 - Understood and documented the underlying business process and evaluated the design, 
determined implementation and tested operating effectiveness of the relevant controls;
 - Critically assessed the key activities and how they impact the returns to the Group from 
the funds and challenged Management’s own consideration of these factors in their 
application of IFRS;
 - Assessed the Group’s monitoring of its role and the three key factors relating to control 
and its exercise in accordance with the judgement required under IFRS; and
 - Reviewing the new fund agreements.
Given the particular focus on USAF, we have:
 - Assessed the role of the USAF Advisory Committee and concluded that Unite do not 
have sole power to direct the activities that are likely to most significantly affect the returns 
of USAF in the future, and therefore Unite do not have control of USAF; and
 - Critically evaluated the impact of the percentage ownership on a regular basis.
Key observations There has been no change to the structure and the role played by Unite as investor and asset / 
development manager in the year. Changes to the underlying fund agreements in the year 
have not significantly altered the level of control exercised by Unite, or the USAF Advisory 
Committee or LSAV Board.
We consider Management’s conclusion that Unite does not have control of the JVs to be consistent 
with our conclusion. Therefore, treatment as joint ventures is considered to be appropriate. INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT TO THE

REIT compliance 
Key audit matter description On 1 January 2017, the Group converted to a Real Estate Investment Trust ‘REIT’, with HMRC 
confirming that the election to REIT status has been validly made. The primary tax consequences 
of conversion and ongoing maintenance of REIT status are that future UK property business 
profits and gains on investment properties are not subject to UK corporation (or income) tax. 
Most notably, this means that the Group no longer recognises deferred tax in relation to the 
valuation gains on the investment property portfolio.
In order to maintain REIT status, the Group must comply with certain tests and other conditions 
to ensure its continuation under the regime. Due to the material impact on the Group’s financial 
results of remaining in compliance with the REIT regime requirements, we consider REIT 
compliance to be a key audit matter.
Refer to page 70 (Audit Committee Statement) and section 2.5: Tax
How the scope of our 
audit responded to the 
key audit matter
Our audit procedures included:
 - Understanding and documenting the underlying business process and then evaluating 
the design, determining implementation and testing operating effectiveness of the 
relevant controls;
 - Utilising tax audit specialists, including REIT specialists, to assess whether the key judgements 
relating to REIT compliance are understood;
 - Considering the clarity and presentation of the Group’s disclosures of its tax balances and 
effective tax rate reconciliation; and
 - Testing the Group’s current and forecast compliance with the REIT regime rules.
Key observations We are satisfied with Management’s calculations and compliance with the REIT regime.
Our application of materiality
We define materiality as the magnitude of misstatement in the financial statements that makes it probable that the economic 
decisions of a reasonably knowledgeable person would be changed or influenced. We use materiality both in planning the scope 
of our audit work and in evaluating the results of our work. 
Based on our professional judgement, we determined materiality for the financial statements as a whole as follows:
Group financial statements Parent company financial statements
Materiality Net Assets: £17.5m (2016: £14.8m)
EPRA Impacting Measures: £3.5m (2016: £3.0m)
£16.5m (2016: £14.2m)
Basis for 
determining 
materiality
1% of Net Assets 
5% of EPRA Earnings
1% of Net Assets
Rationale for the 
benchmark 
applied
We determined materiality for the Group based on 
1% of net assets (2016: 1% of net assets) as the 
balance sheet is considered to be a key driver of a 
property group. 
In addition to net assets, we consider the EPRA 
earnings measure to be a critical financial 
performance measure for the Group and we have 
applied a lower threshold based on 5% of EPRA 
earnings (2016: 5% of EPRA earnings) for testing of 
revenue, cost of sales, operating expenses, loan 
interest and similar charges, finance income, share 
of joint venture profit and taxation.
As the parent holding company the principal 
activity is to hold the investments in subsidiaries. 
Therefore, the net assets balance is considered to 
be the key driver of the company’s performance 
and the most relevant benchmark for materiality.
We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to the Committee all audit differences in excess of £176,250 (2016: £153,000) 
for the Group and the Parent Company, as well as differences below that threshold that, in our view, warranted reporting on qualitative 
grounds. We also report to the Audit Committee on disclosure matters that we identified when assessing the overall presentation of the 
financial statements. Strategic report Corporate governance Financial statements Other information 105
THE UNITE GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017
An overview of the scope of our audit
Our Group audit was scoped by obtaining an understanding of the Group and its environment, including Group-wide controls, and 
assessing the risks of material misstatement at the Group level. 
The Group is audited by one audit team, led by the Senior Statutory Auditor. The audit is performed centrally at the Bristol head office, 
as the books and records for each entity within the Group are maintained at this location. The Group only operates within the United 
Kingdom – this includes Unite as well as the two joint ventures, USAF and LSAV. 
We also tested the consolidation process and carried out analytical review procedures to confirm our conclusion that there were no 
significant risks of material misstatement of the aggregated financial information. We audit all of the Group’s subsidiaries and joint 
ventures which are subject to audit at statutory materiality level, which in many cases is substantially lower than Group materiality.
Other information
The directors are responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the 
information included in the annual report, other than the financial statements and our auditor’s 
report thereon.
Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and, except to the 
extent otherwise explicitly stated in our report, we do not express any form of assurance 
conclusion thereon.
In connection with our audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other 
information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent 
with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be 
materially misstated.
If we identify such material inconsistencies or apparent material misstatements, we are required 
to determine whether there is a material misstatement in the financial statements or a material 
misstatement of the other information. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude 
that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact.
In this context, matters that we are specifically required to report to you as uncorrected material 
misstatements of the other information include where we conclude that:
 - Fair, balanced and understandable – the statement given by the directors that they consider the 
annual report and financial statements taken as a whole is fair, balanced and understandable 
and provides the information necessary for shareholders to assess the Group’s position and 
performance, business model and strategy, is materially inconsistent with our knowledge 
obtained in the audit; or
 - Audit committee reporting – the section describing the work of the audit committee does not 
appropriately address matters communicated by us to the audit committee; or
 - Directors’ statement of compliance with the UK Corporate Governance Code – the parts of the 
directors’ statement required under the Listing Rules relating to the company’s compliance with 
the UK Corporate Governance Code containing provisions specified for review by the auditor 
in accordance with Listing Rule 9.8.10R(2) do not properly disclose a departure from a relevant 
provision of the UK Corporate Governance Code.
We have nothing to report in 
respect of these matters.
Responsibilities of directors
As explained more fully in the directors’ responsibilities statement, the directors are responsible for the preparation of the financial 
statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view, and for such internal control as the directors determine is 
necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
In preparing the financial statements, the directors are responsible for assessing the Group’s and the parent company’s ability to 
continue as a going concern, disclosing as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of 
accounting unless the directors either intend to liquidate the Group or the parent company or to cease operations, or have no 
realistic alternative but to do so.
Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material 
misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a 
high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs (UK) will always detect a material 
misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, 
they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements. INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT TO THE

Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the company’s members those matters we are required to state to 
them in an auditor’s report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility 
to anyone other than the company and the company’s members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we 
have formed.
Report on other legal and regulatory requirements
Opinions on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006
In our opinion the part of the directors’ remuneration report to be audited has been properly prepared in accordance with the 
Companies Act 2006.
In our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of the audit:
 - the information given in the strategic report and the directors’ report for the financial year for which the financial statements are 
prepared is consistent with the financial statements; and
 - the strategic report and the directors’ report have been prepared in accordance with applicable legal requirements.
In the light of the knowledge and understanding of the Group and the parent company and their environment obtained in the course 
of the audit, we have not identified any material misstatements in the strategic report or the directors’ report.
Matters on which we are required to report by exception
Adequacy of explanations received and accounting records
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if, in our opinion:
 - we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our 
audit; or
 - adequate accounting records have not been kept by the parent company, or 
returns adequate for our audit have not been received from branches not visited 
by us; or
 - the parent company financial statements are not in agreement with the 
accounting records and returns.
We have nothing to report in respect 
of  these matters.
Directors’ remuneration
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are also required to report if in our opinion 
certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration have not been made or the part of 
the directors’ remuneration report to be audited is not in agreement with the 
accounting records and returns.
We have nothing to report in respect 
of these matters.
Other matters
Auditor tenure
Following the recommendation of the Audit Committee, we were appointed by the Board on 10 June 2015 to audit the financial 
statements for the year ending 31 December 2015 and subsequent financial periods. The period of total uninterrupted engagement 
including previous renewals and reappointments of the firm is 3 years, covering the years ending 31 December 2015 to 31 December 2017 .

These financial statements are prepared in accordance with IFRS. The Board of Directors also present the Group’s performance 
on the basis recommended for real estate companies by the European Public Real Estate Association (EPRA). The reconciliation 
between IFRS performance measures and EPRA performance measures can be found in Section 2.2 b) for EPRA earnings 
and 2.3 c) for EPRA net asset value (NAV). The adjustments to the IFRS results are intended to help users in the comparability 
of these results across other listed real estate companies in Europe and reflect how the directors monitor the business. 
We have grouped the notes to the financial statements under six main headings: 
- Results for the year, including segmental information, EPRA earnings and EPRA NAV 
- Asset management 
- Funding 
- Working capital  
- Key management and employee benefits 
- Company subsidiaries and joint ventures 
Each section sets out the relevant accounting policies applied in these financial statements together with the key 
judgements and estimates used.

THE UNITE GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017  
 
Section 1: Basis of preparation 
The financial statements consolidate those of The Unite Group plc, (the Company) and its subsidiaries (together referred to as the Group) 
and include the Group’s interests in jointly controlled entities. The parent company financial statements present information about the 
Company as a separate entity and not as a group.  
Both the parent company financial statements and the Group financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International 
Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the EU (Adopted IFRS) and approved by the Directors. On publishing the parent company 
financial statements here together with the Group financial statements, the Company is taking advantage of the exemption in s408 of the 
Companies Act 2006 not to present its individual income statement and related notes. 
The accounting policies have been applied consistently to all periods presented in these consolidated financial statements. 
The Company is a public company and is registered in England, United Kingdom, where it is also domiciled. 
Going concern 
The Group’s business activities, together with the factors likely to affect its future development and position are set out in the Strategic 
Report on pages 1 to 51. In addition, section 4 of these Notes to the financial statements includes the Group’s objectives, policies and 
processes for managing its capital; details of its borrowings and interest rate swaps; and in note 5.3 its exposure to credit risk. 
The Group has prepared cash flow projections three years forward to December 2020 and the Group has sufficient headroom to  
meet all its commitments. The Group secured an investment grade credit rating and arranged a new £500 million unsecured debt facility 
during 2017 and this together with existing facilities will be sufficient to fund the Group’s commitments over the next three years. The Group 
maintains positive relationships with its lending banks and has historically secured new facilities before maturity dates and remained within 
its covenant levels. The Group is in full compliance with its covenants at 31 December 2017 and expects to remain so. Our debt facilities 
include loan-to-value, interest cover and asset class ratio, all of which have a high level of headroom. In order to manage future financial 
commitments, the Group operates a formal approval process, through its Major Investment Approvals committee, to ensure appropriate 
review is undertaken before any transactions are agreed. 
The Directors consider that the Group has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future. 
Measurement convention 
The financial statements are prepared on the historical cost basis except for investment property, investment property under development, 
investments in subsidiaries and interest rate swaps all of which are stated at their fair value. 
Basis of consolidation 
Subsidiaries are those entities controlled by the Company. Control exists when the Company has an existing right that gives it the current 
ability to direct the relevant activities of the subsidiary, has exposure or right to variable returns from its involvement in the subsidiary and has 
the ability to use its power to affect its returns. The financial statements of subsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial statements 
from the date that control commences until the date that control ceases. 
Intra-group balances and transactions, and any unrealised gains and losses arising from intra-group transactions, such as property disposals 
and management fees, are eliminated in preparing the consolidated financial statements. Unrealised gains arising from transactions with 
joint ventures are eliminated to the extent of the Group’s retained interest in the entity. Unrealised losses are eliminated in the same way as 
unrealised gains except where the loss provides evidence of a reduction in the net realisable value of current assets or an impairment in 
the value of fixed assets. 
Impact of accounting standards and interpretations in issue but not yet effective 
At the balance sheet date there are a number of new standards and amendments to existing standards in issue but not yet effective, 
the Group has not early adopted the new or amended standards in preparing these consolidated financial statements. 
IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers – effective for periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018 
IFRS 15 establishes a comprehensive framework for determining whether, how much and when revenue is recognised. It replaces existing 
revenue recognition guidance, including IAS 18 Revenue. 
The Group earns revenue from the following activities (see Note 2.4): 
- Rental income 
- Management fees  
- USAF performance fee 
Based on its assessment to date, the Group does not expect the application of IFRS 15 to result in a significant impact on revenue 
recognition within its consolidated financial statements.  
 
This section lays out the Group’s accounting policies that relate to the financial statements as a whole. Where an accounting 
policy is specific to a particular note to the financial statements, the policy is described in the note to which it relates and has 
been clearly identified in a box.

THE UNITE GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017
Financial statements  
  
Section 1: Basis of preparation continued 
IFRS 9 Financial Instruments – effective for periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018 
IFRS 9 addresses the classification, measurement and derecognition of financial assets and financial liabilities, introduces new rules for 
hedge accounting and a new impairment model for financial assets. 
It is not expected that the transition will have any impact on the carrying value of the relevant assets and liabilities within the consolidated 
financial statements of the Unite Group plc. 
The Group believes that its current hedge relationships will qualify as continuing hedges upon the adoption of IFRS 9. 
IFRS 16 Leases – effective for periods beginning on or after 1 January 2019 
The International Accounting Standards Board issued a new lease standard IFRS 16 to replace existing lease standard (IAS 17) from 
1 January 2019, with early adoption possible before that date for entities that have also early adopted IFRS 15 the new revenue standard 
which comes into effect from 1 January 2018. 
A key change arising from IFRS 16 is that lessees are required to recognise a lease liability reflecting future lease payments and a right-of-
use asset for lease contracts, subject to exceptions for short term leases and leases of low-value assets. 
An initial assessment of the impact of IFRS 16 has been reviewed by management and a number of leases currently in operation within the 
Unite Group plc will fall under the scope of IFRS 16.  
The standard gives the option to either fully restate or recognise an asset equal to the value of the liability on the date of transition.  
The choice of transition method will affect the materiality of the potential impact on adoption of the new standard. 
The Group continues to assess the full impact of IFRS 16 on both IFRS and EPRA measures and intends to adopt the new standard for  
the financial year ending 31 December 2019. The impact of the new standard will depend on the transition approach adopted and the 
contracts in effect at the time of adoption. It is therefore not yet practicable to provide a reliable estimate of the financial impact on the 
Group’s consolidated results. More guidance will be given in the 2018 financial statements. 
Other standards 
The following amended standards and interpretations are not expected to have a significant impact on the Group’s consolidated 
financial statements: 
- IFRS 2 (amendments) ‘Classification and Measurement of Share-based Payment Transaction’ 
- IFRS 10 and IAS 28 (amendments) ‘Sale or Contribution of Assets between an Investor and its Associate or Joint Venture’ 
Accounting estimates and judgements 
The preparation of financial statements requires management to exercise judgement in applying the Group’s accounting policies.  
It also requires the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, income and expenses.  
The estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be 
reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis of making judgements about carrying values of assets  
and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates. 
Estimates and assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis with revisions recognised in the period in which the estimates are revised and 
in any future periods affected. 
The areas involving a higher degree of judgement of complexity are set out below and are explained in more detail in the related notes 
to the financial statements. 
The areas involving the most sensitive estimates and assumptions that are significant to the financial statements are set out below and in 
more detail in the related notes: 
- valuation of investment property and investment property under development (note 3.1) 
The accounting policy descriptions set out the areas where judgement needs exercising, the most significant of which is as follows: 
- classification of joint venture vehicles (note 3.4)

2.1 Segmental information 
The Board of Directors monitors the business along two activity lines, Operations and Property. The reportable segments for the years ended 
31 December 2017 and 31 December 2016 are Operations and Property.  
The Group undertakes its Operations and Property activities directly and through joint ventures with third parties. The joint ventures are an 
integral part of each segment and are included in the information used by the Board to monitor the business.  
The Group’s properties are located exclusively in the United Kingdom. The Group therefore has one geographical segment.  
2.2 Earnings 
EPRA earnings amends IFRS measures by removing principally the unrealised investment property valuation gains and losses such that  
users of the financials are able to see the extent to which dividend payments (dividend per share) are underpinned by earnings arising 
from purely operational activity. The reconciliation between Profit attributable to owners of the parent company and EPRA earnings is 
available in note 2.2 (b). 
The Operations segment manages rental properties, owned directly by the Group or by joint ventures. Its revenues are derived from rental 
income and asset management fees earned from joint ventures. The way in which the Operations segment adds value to the business is 
set out in the Operations review on pages 32 to 35. The Operations segment is the main contributor to EPRA earnings and EPRA EPS and 
these are therefore the key indicators which are used by the Board to monitor the Operations business.  
The Board does not manage or monitor the Operations segment through the balance sheet and therefore no segmental information for 
assets and liabilities is provided for the Operations segment. 
  
 
This section focuses on the results and performance of the Group and provides a reconciliation between the primary 
statements and EPRA performance measures. On the following pages you will find disclosures explaining the Group’s  
results for the year, segmental information, taxation, earnings and net asset value per share.  
The Group uses EPRA earnings and NAV movement as key comparable indicators across other real estate companies  
in Europe.

c) Earnings per share 
The Basic EPS calculation is based on the earnings attributable to the equity shareholders of The Unite Group plc and the weighted 
average number of shares which have been in issue during the year. Basic EPS is adjusted in line with EPRA guidelines in order to allow users 
to compare the business performance of the Group with other listed real estate companies in a consistent manner and to reflect how the 
business is managed and measured on a day to day basis. EPRA EPS and EPRA EPS pre yield related USAF performance fee are calculated 
using EPRA earnings. 
The calculations of basic and EPRA EPS for the year ended 31 December 2017 is as follows:

Movements in the weighted average number of shares have resulted from the issue of shares arising from the employee share based 
payment schemes.  
In 2017 there are no options excluded from the potential dilutive shares. In 2016 there were 16,838 options excluded that did not affect the 
diluted weighted average number of shares.

2.3 Net assets  
EPRA Net Asset Value per share makes adjustments to IFRS measures by principally removing some items that are not expected to 
materialise in normal circumstances like items of deferred tax and the fair value of financial derivatives. The reconciliation between 
IFRS NAV and EPRA NAV is available in note 2.3 (c). 
The Group’s Property business undertakes the acquisition and development of properties. The Property segment’s revenue comprises 
revenue from development management fees earned from joint ventures. The way in which the Property segment adds value to the 
business is set out in the property review on pages 36 to 41.

c) Reconciliation to IFRS 
To determine EPRA NAV net assets reported under IFRS are amended to exclude the mark to market valuation of swaps, deferred tax 
liabilities and to recognise all properties at market value.  
The Group also manages NAV using EPRA NNNAV, which adjusts EPRA NAV to include the fair value of swaps and debt. Under EPRA best 
practice guidelines this is considered to give stakeholders the most relevant comparable information on the current fair value of all the 
assets and liabilities in the Group. 
The Net Assets reported under IFRS reconcile to EPRA NAV and EPRA NNNAV as follows:

£m 
Rental income Operations segment 2.2a 99.7 97.1

   119.6 121.1 
Impact of minority interest on management fees  (0.3) (0.4) 
Total revenue    119.3 120.7 
The cost of sales included in the consolidated income statement includes property operating expenses of £28.5 million (2016: £30.3 million), 
operating lease rentals of £12.6 million (2016: £13.5 million) and costs associated with development fees of £nil million (2016: £1.1 million). 
  
Accounting policies 
Revenue is recognised on the following bases: 
Rental income 
Rental income from property leased out under operating leases (comprising direct lets to students and leases to Universities and 
commercial tenants) is recognised in the income statement on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. Lease incentives are 
sometimes granted on commercial units; these are recognised as an integral part of the total rental income and spread over the 
term of the lease. 
Management and performance fees 
The Group acts as asset and property manager for the joint ventures and receives management fees in relation to these services. 
In addition, the Group is entitled to performance fees from USAF and LSAV if the joint ventures outperform certain benchmarks. 
The Group receives an enhanced equity interest in the JVs as consideration for the performance fee. 
Management and performance fees are recognised, in line with the management contracts, in the period to which they relate 
as services are provided.

2.5 Tax 
As a REIT, rental profits and gains on disposal of investment properties are exempt from corporation tax. The Group pays UK corporation 
tax on the profits from its residual business, including profits arising on construction operations and management fees received from joint 
ventures, together with UK income tax on rental income that arises from investments held by offshore subsidiaries in which the Group holds 
a minority interest. 
 
a) Tax – income statement 
The total taxation charge/(credit) in the income statement is analysed as follows: 
 
2017 
£m 
2016 
£m 
Corporation tax on residual business income arising in UK companies 1.7  – 
Income tax on UK rental income arising in non-UK companies  – 2.3 
Current tax charge 1.7 2.3 
   
Reversal of deferred tax provision in respect of REIT property business assets  – (39.8) 
Origination and reversal of temporary differences 4.5 13.7 
Effect of change in tax rate (0.6) (1.2) 
Deferred tax charge/(credit) 3.9 (27.3) 
   
Total tax charge/(credit) in income statement 5.6 (25.0) 
The Group elected to be taxed as a REIT with effect from 1 January 2017. As a result of this, the Group’s investment properties are exempt 
from tax and no deferred tax is required on the balance sheet in relation to these assets. Accordingly, the Group’s deferred tax now only 
relates to non-property investments (being primarily its interests in joint ventures) and historic tax losses. 
The movement in deferred tax provided is shown in more detail in note 2.5 d) below.  
Accounting policies 
The tax charge for the year is recognised in the income statement and the statement of comprehensive income, according to the 
accounting treatment of the related transaction. The tax charge comprises both current and deferred tax. 
Current tax is the expected tax payable or receivable on the taxable income or loss for the year and any adjustment to tax payable 
in respect of previous years. The current tax charge is based on tax rates that are enacted or substantively enacted at the year end. 
Deferred tax arises due to certain temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting 
purposes and those for taxation purposes. Temporary differences relating to investments in subsidiaries and joint ventures are not 
provided for to the extent that they will probably not reverse in the foreseeable future. The amount of deferred tax provided is based 
on the expected manner of realisation or settlement of the carrying amount of assets and liabilities.  
As a REIT, rental profits and gains on disposal of investment properties are exempt from corporation tax. As a result, no deferred tax 
provision has been recognised at the balance sheet date in respect of property assets (revaluation and capital allowances). 
The Group’s investments in unit trusts are not exempt from tax as a REIT and, where they remain within the charge to tax, a deferred tax 
liability has been recognised as appropriate. The Group will be able to utilise its tax adjusted losses against gains arising on the disposal 
of its investments in unit trusts. As the deferred tax liability on non-property business investments exceeds the asset relating to the losses, 
the deferred tax asset in respect of the tax adjusted losses has been recognised in full.

2.5 Tax continued 
a) Tax – income statement continued 
In the income statement, a tax charge of £5.6 million arises on a profit before tax of £229.4 million. The taxation charge that would arise 
at the standard rate of UK corporation tax is reconciled to the actual tax charge as follows: 
 
2017 
£m 
2016 
£m 
Profit before tax 229.4 201.4 
   
Income tax using the UK corporation tax rate of 19.25% (2016: 20%) 44.2 40.3

Effect of statutory tax reliefs (0.6) (1.5) 
Income due to Unite Foundation  – (1.0) 
Effect of tax deduction transferred to equity on share schemes  0.5 0.4 
Rate difference on deferred tax (0.5) (1.2) 
Prior years adjustments (0.7) 0.3 
Total tax charge/(credit) in income statement 5.6 (25.0) 
The main rate of corporation tax reduced from 20% to 19% with effect from 1 April 2017. Accordingly, the reconciliation above has been 
calculated at a rate of 19.25% (2016: 20%). 
As a UK REIT, the Group is exempt from UK corporation tax on the profits from its property rental business. Accordingly, the element of the 
Group's profit before tax relating to its property rental business has been separately identified in the reconciliation above.  
Although the Group does not pay UK corporation tax on the profits from its property rental business, it is required to distribute 90% of the 
profits from its property rental business after accounting for tax adjustments as a Property Income Distribution ("PID"). PIDs are charged to 
tax in the same way as property income in the hands of the recipient. For the year ended 31 December 2017 the required PID is expected 
to be £40.7m of which £36.7m has been distributed at the year end, with the remainder to be distributed in May 2018. 
The UK corporation tax rate will reduce from 19% to 17% with effect from 1 April 2020. This will reduce the Group’s future current tax  
charge accordingly. 
b) Tax – other comprehensive income 
Within other comprehensive income a tax charge totalling £nil (2016: £1.6 million credit) has been recognised representing deferred tax. 
An analysis of this is included in the deferred tax movement on page 128. 
c) Tax – statement of changes in equity 
Within the statement of changes in equity a tax credit totalling £0.7 million (2016: £0.1 million charge) has been recognised representing 
deferred tax. An analysis of this is included in the deferred tax movement on page 128.

EPRA’s best practice recommendations. 
The deferred tax liability at 31 December 2017 has been calculated based on the rate at which it is expected to reverse. 
As a REIT, disposals of investment property are exempt from tax and as a result no deferred tax liability has been recognised in relation to 
these assets. The Group's investments in property unit trusts (being primarily its interests in joint ventures) are not exempt from tax as a REIT. 
Where they remain within the charge to tax, a deferred tax liability has been recognised on the excess of the market value of these assets 
over their historic tax base cost. At 31 December 2017 the deferred tax liability in relation to these investments was £20.6m.  
Company 
Deferred tax has not been recognised on temporary differences of £165.9 million (2016: £118.9 million) in respect of revaluation  
of subsidiaries and investment in joint ventures as it is considered unlikely that these investments will be divested.

Financial statements  
  
Section 3: Asset management 
3.1 Wholly owned property assets 
The Group’s wholly owned property portfolio is held in two groups on the balance sheet at the carrying values detailed below.  
In the Group’s EPRA NAV, all these groups are shown at market value.  
i) Investment property (fixed assets)  
These are assets that the Group intends to hold for a long period to earn rental income or capital appreciation. The assets are held at fair 
value in the balance sheet with changes in fair value taken to the income statement. 
ii) Investment property under development (fixed assets) 
These are assets which are currently in the course of construction and which will be transferred to ‘Investment property’ on completion. 
The assets are held at fair value in the balance sheet with changes in fair value taken to the income statement. 
Valuation process 
The valuations of the properties are performed twice a year on the basis of valuation reports prepared by external, independent valuers, 
having an appropriate recognised professional qualification. The fair values are based on market values as defined in the RICS Appraisal 
and Valuation Manual, issued by the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors. CB Richard Ellis Ltd, Jones Lang LaSalle Ltd and Messrs Knight 
Frank, Chartered Surveyors were the valuers in the years ended 31 December 2017 and 2016. 
The valuations are based on both: 
- Information provided by the Group such as current rents, occupancy, operating costs, terms and conditions of 
leases and nomination agreements, capital expenditure, etc. This information is derived from the Group’s financial 
systems and is subject to the Group’s overall control environment. 
- Assumptions and valuation models used by the valuers – the assumptions are typically market related, such as 
yield and discount rates. These are based on their professional judgement and market observation. 
The information provided to the valuers – and the assumptions and the valuation models used by the valuers – are reviewed by the 
Management Board and the CFO. This includes a review of the fair value movements over the year. 
  
 
The Group holds its property portfolio directly and through its joint ventures. The performance of the property portfolio whether 
wholly owned or in joint ventures is the key factor that drives net asset value (NAV), one of the Group’s key performance 
indicators. The following pages provide disclosures about the Group’s investments in property assets and joint ventures and 
their performance over the year. 
Accounting policies 
Properties held under operating leases are not included in assets, but the future payments due in respect of these properties are 
disclosed in note 4.6a. 
Investment property and investment property under development are held at fair value. 
Inventories are shown at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary 
course of business less the estimated costs of completion and selling expenses. All costs directly associated with the purchase and 
construction of a property, and all subsequent qualifying expenditure is capitalised.  
The recognition of acquisitions and disposals of investment and other property occurs on unconditional exchange of contracts. 
Borrowing costs are capitalised if they are directly attributable to the acquisition and construction of a property asset. Capitalisation 
of borrowing costs commences when the activities to prepare the asset are in progress and expenditures and borrowing costs are 
being incurred. Capitalisation of borrowing costs continues until the assets are substantially ready for their intended use but stops if 
development activities are suspended. If the resulting carrying amount of the asset exceeds its recoverable amount, an impairment loss 
is recognised. The capitalisation rate is arrived at by reference to the actual rate payable on borrowings for development purposes or, 
with regard to that part of the development cost financed out of general borrowings, to the average rate. During the year the average 
capitalisation rate used was 6.1% (2016: 6.4%). 
The external valuation of property assets involves significant judgement and changes to the core assumptions; market conditions, 
rental income, occupancy and property management costs, could have a significant impact on the carrying value of these assets. 
See below for more details of the valuation process.

The valuation technique for investment properties is a discounted cash flow using the following inputs: net rental income, estimated future 
costs, occupancy and property management costs. 
Where the asset is leased to a University, the valuations also reflect the length of the lease, the allocation of maintenance and insurance 
responsibilities between the Group and the lessee, and the market’s general perception of the lessee’s credit worthiness. 
The resulting valuations are cross-checked against the initial yields and the capital value per bed derived from actual market transactions. 
For development properties, the fair value is usually calculated by estimating the fair value of the completed property (using the 
discounted cash flow method) less estimated costs to completion.

Intangible assets include £2.0 million (2016: £3.9 million) of assets not being amortised as they are not yet ready for use. Property, plant 
and equipment assets include £0.7m (2016: £1.1m) of assets not being depreciated as they are not ready for use. At 31 December 2017 
the Group had capital commitments amounting to £1.9 million relating to intangible assets and £nil million relating to Property, plant  
and equipment. 
  
Accounting policies 
Property, plant and equipment 
Other than land and buildings; property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment  
losses (see below). Land and buildings are stated at fair value on the same basis as investment properties. Property, plant and 
equipment mainly comprise leasehold improvements at the Group’s head office and London office as well as computer hardware  
and software at these sites. 
Depreciation is charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of items of property, plant and 
equipment. Freehold land is not depreciated. The estimated useful lives are as follows: 
- Leasehold 
improvements 
- Other assets  
Shorter life of lease and economic life 
 
4–20 years 
Intangible assets 
Intangible assets predominately comprise internally developed computer software which allows customers to book online  
and processes transactions within the sales cycle. The expenditure capitalised includes the cost of materials, direct labour and an 
appropriate proportion of overheads. Expenditure on research activities is recognised in the income statement as an expense incurred, 
2017: £nil, (2016: £nil). The assets are amortised on a straight-line basis over 4 to 7 years being the estimated useful lives of the intangible 
assets, from the date they are available for use. Amortisation is charged to the income statement within operating expenses.

*  Part of the Group’s interest is held through a subsidiary, USAF (Feeder) Guernsey Ltd, in which there is an external investor. A minority interest therefore 
occurs on consolidation of the Group’s results representing the external investor’s share of profits and assets relating to its investment in USAF. The ordinary 
shareholders of The Unite Group plc are beneficially interested in 24.6% (2016: 23.0%) of USAF. 
  
Accounting policies 
Joint ventures are those entities over whose activities the Group has joint control, established by contractual agreement. The consolidated 
financial statements include joint ventures initially at cost subsequently increased or decreased by the Group’s share of total gains and 
losses of joint ventures on an equity basis. Interest free joint venture investment loans are initially recorded at fair value – the difference 
between the nominal amount and fair value being treated as an investment in the joint venture. The implied discount is amortised over 
the contracted life of the investment loan. 
The Directors consider that the agreements integral to its joint ventures result in the Group having joint control; a significant degree of 
judgement is exercised in this assessment due to the complexity of the contractual arrangements.  
USAF and LSAV are jointly owned entities that are accounted for as joint ventures. Due to the complexity of the contractual 
arrangements and Unite’s role as manager of the joint venture vehicles, the assessment of joint control following changes to 
accounting standards (IFRS10) involves judgements around a number of significant factors. These factors include how Unite as fund 
manager has the ability to direct relevant activities such as acquisitions, disposals, capital expenditure for refurbishments and funding 
whether through debt or equity. This assessment for USAF is complex because of the number of unitholders and how their rights are 
represented through an Advisory Committee. For some of the activities it is not clear who has definitive control of the activities: in some 
scenarios the Group can control, in others the Advisory Committee. However, for the activities which are considered to have the 
greatest impact on the returns of USAF, acquisitions and equity financing, it has been determined that the Group and the Advisory 
Committee has joint power in directing these activities and that on balance, it is appropriate to account for USAF as a joint venture. 
The assessment for LSAV is more straightforward because the Group and GIC each own 50% of the joint venture and there is therefore 
much clearer evidence that control over the key activities is shared by the two parties.

In addition to its equity shares, the Group has also provided interest free investment loans to some of the joint ventures. These were primarily 
provided on the setting up of the joint venture to provide capital to acquire investment properties. As a result of being provided interest 
free, the loans were discounted on recognition to reflect the fair value, the unwinding of the discount is reflected in the Group’s finance 
income. 
c) Transactions with joint ventures 
The Group acts as asset and property manager for the joint ventures and receives management fees in relation to these services.  
In addition, the Group is entitled to performance fees from USAF and LSAV if the joint ventures outperform certain benchmarks. The Group 
receives an enhanced equity interest in the joint ventures as consideration for the performance fee. The Group has recognised the 
following fees in its results for the year.

by USAF net of advisory fee costs of £nil million (2016: £0.5 million) and a £0.6 million (2016: £1.1 million) adjustment related to trading with joint ventures. The 
USAF performance fee will be settled in units in The UNITE UK Student Accommodation Fund rather than cash. Full details of the USAF performance fees are 
set out in the Strategic Report on pages 1 to 51. 
Included in share of joint venture profit in the income statement is a share of joint venture property management fee costs of £1.2 million 
(2016: £1.6 million). On an EPRA basis these costs are deducted from the property management fees shown above, plus an adjustment 
for the minority interest of £0.2 million (2016: £0.4 million). This results in the net fees included in the Operating Segment result (note 2.2a) 
of £14.1 million (2016: £14.0 million). Development management fees are included in the Property Segment result (note 2.2a). Investment 
management fees are included within the unallocated to segments (note 2.2a). 
Included in the movement in EPRA NAV is a USAF property acquisition fee of £0.4 million (2016: £0.4 million). This is the gross fee of £1.0 million 
(2016: £0.5 million) paid by USAF net of a £0.3 million (2016: £0.1 million) adjustment related to trading with joint ventures and a £0.3 million 
(2016: £nil) adjustment relating to other acquisition costs paid to a third party. 
Included in the movement in EPRA NAV is an LSAV property acquisition fee of £0.5 million (2016: £nil). This is the gross fee of £1.0 million 
(2016: £nil) paid by LSAV net of a £0.5 million (2016: £nil) adjustment related to trading with joint ventures. 
During the year the Group has paid operating lease rentals to USAF relating to one property under a sale and leaseback agreement 
amounting to £0.7 million (2016: £2.2 million).

During the year the Group recognised additional proceeds of £2 million in relation to the sale of a property to LSAV in 2015 under the  
terms of the original sale agreement. At the balance sheet date the proceeds had not been settled and therefore no cash flows have 
been disclosed. In 2016 the Group sold two properties to USAF for £88.4 million. Both properties had been held on the balance sheet  
as investment property under development within non-current assets, the proceeds and carrying value of the property are therefore 
recognised in profit on disposal of property and the cash flows in investing activities. The profits relating to sales and associated disposal

The carrying value of investment in subsidiaries has been calculated using the equity attributable to the owners of the parent company 
from the consolidated balance sheet adjusted for the fair value of fixed rate loans. This includes investment property, investment property 
under development and swaps at a fair value calculated by a third party expert. All investment properties and investment properties 
under development are classified as Level 3 in the IFRS 13 fair value hierarchy and have been discussed on page 132. The fixed rate loans 
range between Level 1 and Level 2 in the IFRS 13 fair value hierarchy and have been discussed further on page 140. 
In addition to the equity investment in subsidiaries and joint ventures, the Company has provided a loan with interest chargeable at 6.125% 
to LDC (Holdings) plc. The carrying value of the loan to LDC (Holdings) plc was £90.0 million (2016: £90.0 million). A further loan of £89.9 
million (2016: £89.9 million) was provided to LDC (Holdings) plc with interest chargeable at 5.0%; this loan was fully repaid during the year. 
A full list of the Company’s subsidiaries and joint ventures can be found in note 7.  
  
Accounting policies 
In the financial statements of the Company, investments in subsidiaries are held at fair value. Changes in fair value are recognised

Interest bearing borrowings are recognised initially at fair value, less attributable transaction costs. Subsequent to initial recognition, 
interest bearing borrowings are stated at amortised cost with any difference between cost and redemption value being recognised 
in the income statement over the period of the borrowings on an effective interest basis. 
On 10 October 2013 the Group issued a convertible bond. The unsecured instrument paid a coupon of 2.5%. In accordance with IFRS, 
the equity and debt components of the bond were accounted for separately. As a result, £80.3 million was recognised as a liability in 
the balance sheet on issue and the remainder of the proceeds, £9.6 million, which represents the equity component, was credited to 
reserves. The difference between the fair value of the liability and the principal value was amortised through the income statement 
from the date of issue. Issue costs of £2.0m were allocated between equity and debt and the element relating to the debt component 
was amortised over the life of the bond. The issue costs apportioned to equity of £0.2 million were not amortised. 
The full principal value of the Group’s convertible bond (£89.9 million) converted into equity in June with the issue of 18,593,589 ordinary 
shares in Unite Group plc.

4.1 Borrowings continued 
The fair value of loans classified as Level 1 in the IFRS fair value hierarchy is determined using quoted prices in active markets for  
identical liabilities. 
The fair value of loans classified as Level 2 in the IFRS fair value hierarchy has been calculated by a third party expert discounting estimated 
future cash flows on the basis of market expectation of future interest rates. 
4.2 Interest rate swaps 
The Group uses interest rate swaps to manage the Group’s exposure to interest rate fluctuations. In accordance with the Group’s treasury 
policy, the Group does not hold or issue interest rate swaps for trading purposes and only holds swaps which are considered to be 
commercially effective.  
The following table shows the fair value of interest rate swaps:

£m 
2016 
£m 
Current  – – 
Non-current 0.8 11.6 
Fair value of interest rate swaps 0.8 11.6 
The fair values of interest rate swaps have been calculated by a third party expert, discounting estimated future cash flows on the basis 
of market expectations of future interest rates, representing Level 2 in the IFRS 13 fair value hierarchy.  
4.3 Net financing costs 
  
Accounting policies 
Interest rate swaps are recognised initially and subsequently at fair value, with mark to market movements recognised in the income 
statement unless cash flow hedge accounting is applied.  
Hedge accounting, as defined in IFRS, is when the interest rate swap is designated as the hedging instrument in a hedge of the 
variability in cash flows attributable to the interest risk of borrowings. The effective portion of changes in fair value of the interest rate 
swap is recognised in other comprehensive income and presented in the hedging reserve in equity. Any ineffective portion of changes 
in the fair value of the interest rate swap is recognised immediately in profit or loss. The Group only applies hedge accounting when the 
hedge is expected to be highly effective. 
When a hedging instrument or hedge relationship is terminated but the hedged transaction is still expected to occur, the cumulative 
gain or loss at that point remains in equity with any subsequent movements in fair value taken to the income statement. If the hedged 
transaction is no longer probable, the cumulative unrealised gain or loss recognised in equity is recognised in the income statement 
immediately. 
The fair value of interest rate swaps is the estimated amount that the Group would receive or pay to terminate the swap at the balance 
sheet date, taking into account current interest rates and the current credit-worthiness of the swap counterparties. 
Accounting policies 
Net financing costs comprise interest payable on borrowings less interest receivable on funds invested (both calculated using the 
effective interest rate method) and gains and losses on hedging instruments that are recognised in the income statement.

4.5 Financial risk factors 
The Group’s activities expose it to a variety of financial risks: market risks – primarily interest rate risk, credit risk and liquidity risk. The Group’s 
treasury policy focuses on the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to minimise potential adverse effects on the Group’s financial 
performance. Details on credit risk can be found in note 5.3. 
a) Interest rate risk 
Interest rate risk is the risk that the Group is impacted by significant changes in interest rates. Borrowings issued at or swapped to floating 
rates expose the Group to interest rate risk. The Group’s policy is separated into two main areas: 
i) Development and refinancing 
The Group had no specific development borrowings as at 31 December 2017 (2016: £nil). 
The Group’s principal exposure to interest rate fluctuations during development relates to movements in longer term interest rates which 
affect the amount of debt the property income is capable of servicing at completion. Significant adverse movements undermine the 
Group’s ability to release equity from its developments. 
The Group will continue to review the level of its hedging in the light of the current low interest rate environment. The Group’s policy allows 
this exposure to be managed through the use of forward starting swaps. 
ii) Medium and long-term finance 
The Group holds its medium and long-term bank finance under both floating and fixed rate arrangements. The majority of this floating 
debt is hedged through the use of interest rate swap agreements, although not all these arrangements qualify for hedge accounting 
under IAS 39. The Group’s policy guideline has been to hedge 75% and 95% of the Group’s exposure for terms of approximately 2–10 years. 
At 31 December 2017, after taking account of interest rate swaps, 64% (2016: 100%) of the Group’s medium and long-term investment 
borrowing was held at fixed rates; however further contracted hedging with a forward start state and planned fixed rate funding will 
increase the hedge ratio to above 90% over the next 18 months. Excluding the £4.7 million (2016: £92.9 million) of swaps the fixed 
investment borrowing is at an average rate of 5.2% (2016: 4.6%) for an average period of 4.5 years (2016: 5 years), including all debt  
with current or forward starting swaps the average rate is 4.0% (2016: 4.4%).  
The Group holds interest rate swaps at 31 December 2017 against £4.7 million (2016: £92.9 million) of the Group’s borrowings.  
The maturity of these swaps and the applicable interest rates are as follows:

During the year, if interest rates had increased/decreased by 1%, pre-tax profit for the year would have been £0.8 million (2016: £0.6 million) 
lower/higher.  
b) Liquidity risk 
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due. For development activities, the Group 
has a policy to inject substantially the full amount of equity required for each development before drawing debt against the specific 
facility for the development. The funding requirements of each scheme are therefore substantially ‘ring-fenced’ and secured at the outset 
of works. 
The table below analyses the Group’s financial liabilities and interest rate swaps into relevant maturity groupings based on the period 
remaining until the contractual maturity date. The amounts disclosed in the table are the contractual undiscounted cash flows (including 
interest), so will not always reconcile with the amounts disclosed on the balance sheet.

Many of the Group’s funding facilities carry covenants. The Group monitors its covenant position and the headroom available on an 
ongoing basis. At 31 December 2017, the Group was in full compliance with all of its borrowing covenants. The Group is able to use 
available cash to reduce debt to increase headroom on its loan to value (LTV) covenants. The covenant headroom position is outlined 
below and assumes that the Group is able to use available cash within net debt.

These leases primarily relate to properties which the Group has sold and leased back and on which rental income is earned. The leases are 
generally for periods between 12 and 17 years and subject to annual RPI-based rent review. The total operating lease expenditure 
incurred during the year was £14.5 million (2016: £15.3 million). 
b) Receivable

4.7 Capital management 
The capital structure of the Group consists of shareholders’ equity and adjusted net debt, including cash held on deposit. The Group’s 
equity is analysed into its various components in the Statement of Changes in Equity. The components and calculation of adjusted net 
debt is set out in note 4.4. Capital is managed so as to continue as a going concern and to promote the long-term success of the business 
and to maintain sustainable returns for shareholders and joint venture partners.  
The Group uses a number of key metrics to manage its capital structure: 
- adjusted net debt (4.4) 
- adjusted gearing (4.4) 
- LTV (2.3a) 
- weighted average cost of investment debt (4.5aii) 
In order to manage levels of adjusted gearing over the medium term, the Group seeks to deliver NAV growth and to recycle capital 
invested in lower performing assets into new assets and property developments. £29.6 million of property assets were sold in 2017 and 
we plan to sell an average of £75 – £125 million of property each year. The Group targets a yield on cost of approximately 8%. The Group 
does not commit to developing new sites until sufficient equity and funding to fulfil the full cost of the development is secure. 
The Board monitors the ability of the Group to pay dividends out of available cash and distributable profits. The Operations Segment 
generated cash of £63.2 million (2016: £61.3 million) during the year, thereby covering the combined paid interim dividend and proposed 
final dividend of £54.8 million, 1.2 times (2016: £40.0 million, 1.5 times). 
  
Accounting policies 
Payments made under operating leases are recognised in the income statement on a straight- line basis over the term of the lease. 
Lease incentives received are recognised in the income statement as an integral part of the total lease expense. Where the property 
interest under an operating lease is classified as an investment property, the property interest is accounted for as if it were a finance 
lease and the fair value model is used for the asset recognised. 
The Group has a number of sale and leaseback properties which are accounted for as operating leases.

The holders of ordinary shares are entitled to receive dividends as declared from time to time and are entitled to one vote per share at 
meetings of the Company. All shares rank equally with regard to the Company’s residual assets. 
4.9 Dividends 
During the year, the Company declared and paid an interim dividend of £17.7 million – 7.3p per share (2016: £13.2 million – 6.0p per share) 
and paid a £26.7 million final dividend – 12.0p per share relating to the year ended 31 December 2016 (2015: £21.0 million – 9.5p per share).  
After the year end, the Directors proposed a final dividend per share of 15.4p (2016: 12.0p), bringing the total dividend per share for the 
year to 22.7p (2016: 18.0p). No provision has been made in relation to this dividend. 
The Group has modelled tax adjusted property business profits for five years and declared PIDs in respect of the May 2017 and  
November 2017 distributions to ensure that the PID requirement will be satisfied. The combined PID from the distributions made during  
2017 comprise 78% of the Group’s forecast tax exempt property rental business profit, leaving a small amount that can be paid as part  
of the May 2018 distribution. 
  
Accounting policies 
Ordinary shares are classified as equity. External costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares, other than on a business 
combination, are shown as a deduction, net of tax, in equity from the proceeds. Share issue costs incurred directly in connection with 
a business combination are deducted from the proceeds of the issue. 
Accounting policies 
Dividends are recognised through equity on the earlier of their approval by the Company’s shareholders or their payment.

This section focuses on how the Group generates its operating cash flows. Careful management of working capital is vital  
to ensure that the Group can meet its trading and financing obligations within its ordinary operating cycle.  
On the following pages you will find disclosures around the Group’s cash position and how cash is generated from the Group’s 
trading activities, and disclosures around trade receivables and payables. 
Accounting policies 
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash balances and call deposits. Cash equivalents are short-term, highly liquid investments that 
are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and which are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value. Bank overdrafts that 
are repayable on demand and form an integral part of the Group’s cash management are included as a component of cash and 
cash equivalents for the purpose of the statement of cash flows.

Accounting policies 
Trade receivables are initially recognised at the amount invoiced to the customer (fair value) and subsequently at the amounts 
considered recoverable (amortised cost). Estimates are used in determining the level of receivables that will not, in the opinion of 
the Board, be collected. These estimates include such factors as historical experience and industry specific factors. A provision for 
impairment of trade receivables is established when there is sufficient evidence that the Group will not be able to collect all amounts 
due. The carrying value of trade receivables is considered to approximate fair value.

Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its contractual 
obligations. It arises principally from the Group’s cash balances, the Group’s receivables from customers and joint ventures and loans 
provided to the Group’s joint ventures.  
At the year end, the Group’s maximum exposure to credit risk was as follows:

a) Cash 
The Group operates investment guidelines with respect to surplus cash. Counterparty limits for cash deposits are largely based upon  
long-term ratings published by credit rating agencies and credit default swap rates. 
b) Trade receivables 
The Group’s customers can be split into two groups – (i) students (individuals) and (ii) commercial organisations including Universities. 
The Group’s exposure to credit risk is influenced by the characteristics of each customer. The Group holds tenant deposits of £9.0 million 
(2016: £8.5 million) as collateral against individual customers. Based on the Group’s experience and historical low level of bad debt the 
Group views these receivables as recoverable balances with a low risk of default. 
c) Joint ventures 
Amounts receivable from joint ventures fall into two categories – working capital balances and investment loans. The Group has strong 
working relationships with its joint venture partners and therefore views this as a low credit risk balance. 
5.4 Trade and other payables 
Trade and other payables due within one year can be analysed as follows:

Trade and other payables 152.1 123.7 5.7 4.3 
Other payable and accrued expenses include £9.0million (2016: £8.5 million) in relation to customer deposits. These will be returned at the 
end of the tenancy subject to the condition of the accommodation and payment of any outstanding amounts. Deferred income relates 
to rental income that has been collected in advance of it being recognised as revenue.  
Accounting policies 
Trade payables are initially recognised at the value of the invoice received from a supplier (fair value) and subsequently at amortised 
cost. The carrying value of trade payables is considered approximate to fair value.

THE UNITE GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 NOTICE OF ANNUAL GENERAL MEETING CONTINUED
Notes
1. A member of the Company who wishes to attend the meeting in person should arrive at South Quay, Temple Back, Bristol, BS1 6FL 
6GD in good time before the meeting, which will commence at 9.30 a.m. In order to gain admittance to the meeting, members 
may be required to produce their attendance card, which is attached to the form of proxy enclosed with this document, or 
otherwise prove their identity.
2. A member of the Company who is entitled to attend, speak and vote at the meeting and who is unable or does not wish to attend 
the meeting is entitled to appoint a proxy to exercise all or any of his/her rights to attend and to speak and vote on his/her behalf at 
the meeting. A member may appoint more than one proxy provided each proxy is appointed to exercise rights attached to different 
shares (so a member must have more than one share to be able to appoint more than one proxy). A proxy need not be a member of 
the Company but must attend the meeting to represent his/her appointing member. Appointing a proxy will not prevent a member 
from attending in person and voting at the meeting although voting in person at the meeting will terminate a member’s proxy 
appointment. A proxy must vote in accordance with any instructions given by the member by whom the proxy is appointed. A form 
of proxy which may be used to make such appointment and give proxy instructions accompanies this notice. You can only appoint 
a proxy using the procedures set out in these notes and the notes to the proxy form.
3. To be valid, any form of proxy, and the original or duly certified copy of the power of attorney or other authority (if any) under 
which it is signed or authenticated, must be received by hand or by post at Computershare Investor Services PLC, The Pavilions, 
Bridgwater Road, Bristol, BS99 6ZY, no later than 09.30 a.m. on 8 May 2018.
4. CREST members who wish to appoint a proxy or proxies through the CREST electronic proxy appointment service may do so for the 
meeting and any adjournment(s) thereof by following the procedures described in the CREST Manual. CREST Personal Members or 
other CREST sponsored members, and those CREST members who have appointed a voting service provider, should refer to their 
CREST sponsor or voting service provider(s), who will be able to take the appropriate action on their behalf.
5. In order for a proxy appointment or instruction made by means of CREST to be valid, the appropriate CREST message (a CREST 
Proxy Instruction) must be properly authenticated in accordance with Euroclear UK & Ireland Limited’s (Euroclear) specifications, 
and must contain the information required for such instruction, as described in the CREST Manual. The message, regardless of 
whether it constitutes the appointment of a proxy, the revocation of a proxy or is an amendment to the instruction given to a 
previously appointed proxy must, in order to be a valid, be transmitted so as to be received by the Company’s agent (CREST ID 
3RA50) by the latest time for receipt of proxy appointments specified in note 3 above. For this purpose, the time of receipt will be 
taken to be the time (as determined by the timestamp applied to the message by the CREST Application Host) from which the 
Company’s agent is able to retrieve the message by enquiry to CREST in the manner prescribed by CREST. After this time any 
change of instructions to proxies appointed through CREST should be communicated to the appointee through other means.
6. CREST members and, where applicable, their CREST sponsors or voting service providers, should note that Euroclear does not 
make available special procedures in CREST for any particular message. Normal system timings and limitations will, therefore, 
apply in relation to the input of CREST Proxy Instructions. It is the responsibility of the CREST member concerned to take (or, if the 
CREST member is a CREST personal member, or sponsored member, or has appointed a voting service provider, to procure that his/
her CREST sponsor or voting service provider(s) take(s)) such action as shall be necessary to ensure that a message is transmitted by 
means of the CREST system by any particular time. In this connection, CREST members and, where applicable, their CREST sponsors 
or voting service providers are referred, in particular, to those sections of the CREST Manual concerning practical limitations of the 
CREST system and timings.
7 . The Company may treat as invalid a CREST Proxy Instruction in the circumstances set out in Regulation 35(5)(a) of the Uncertificated 
Securities Regulations 2001 (as amended).
8. If you would like to submit your proxy vote via the internet, you can do so by accessing our registrar’s website  
(www.eproxyappointment.com). You will require the control number, your unique PIN (which will expire at the end of the voting 
period) and your Shareholder Reference Number (SRN), printed on the proxy card, in order to log in and submit your proxy vote 
electronically. You can access this site from any internet enabled PC. If you submit your proxy via the internet it should reach the 
registrar by 09.30 a.m. on 8 May 2018. Should you complete your proxy form electronically and then post a hard copy, the form that 
arrives last will be counted to the exclusion of instructions received earlier, whether electronic or posted. Please refer to the terms 
and conditions of the service on the website.
9. In the case of joint holders of shares, where more than one of the joint holders purports to appoint a proxy, only the appointment 
submitted by the most senior holder will be accepted. Seniority is determined by the order in which the names of the joint holders 
appear in the Company’s register of members in respect of the joint holding (the first-named being the most senior).
10. If you submit more than one valid proxy appointment in respect of the same shares, the appointment received last before the 
latest time for the receipt of proxies will take precedence.
11. Any person to whom this notice has been sent who is a person nominated under section 146 of the Act to enjoy information rights 
(a Nominated Person) may, under an agreement between him/her and the shareholder by whom he/she was nominated, have a 
right to be appointed (or to have someone else appointed) as a proxy for the meeting. If a Nominated Person has no such proxy 
appointment right or does not wish to exercise it, he/she may, under any such agreement, have a right to give instructions to the 
shareholder as to the exercise of voting rights.

accordance with Section 437 of the Act. The Company may not require the members requesting any such website publication 
to pay its expenses in complying with Sections 527 or 528 of the Act. Where the Company is required to place a statement on a 
website under Section 527 of the Act, it must forward the statement to the Company’s auditor not later than the time when it makes 
the statement available on the website. The business which may be dealt with at the meeting includes any statement that the 
Company has been required under Section 527 of the Act to publish on a website.

and is intended to be moved at the meeting, provided that: (a) the resolution must not be, if passed, ineffective (whether by reason

proposed resolution) which may properly be included in the business of the meeting, provided that the matter is not defamatory of 
any person, frivolous or vexatious. A request may be in hard copy form or electronic form, must identify the matter to be included in 
the business, must be accompanied by a statement setting out the grounds for the request, must be authenticated by the person or 
persons making it and must be received by the Company not later than six weeks before the meeting, or, if later, the time at which
