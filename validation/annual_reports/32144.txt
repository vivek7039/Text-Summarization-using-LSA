Caledonia is a self-managed investment trust company with net assets of 
£1.9bn. Our aim is to grow net assets and dividends paid to shareholders 
over the long term, whilst managing risk to mitigate volatility of returns. 
We achieve this by investing in proven well-managed businesses that 
combine long term growth characteristics with an ability to deliver 
increasing levels of income. Our investments cover both listed and 
private markets in broadly equal proportions, a range of sectors and, 
in particular through our fund investments, a global reach. 
The success of this strategy can be seen in the performance of Caledonia’s 
NAV per share total return measured against the FTSE All-Share since 
1987 and a record of 50 years of increasing its annual dividends.

The measures below are deemed appropriate to assess the underlying operating results and enhance the comparability and understanding of the financial performance of Caledonia:
1. Net assets provides a measure of the value of the company to shareholders and is taken from the IFRS group net assets.
2.  Net asset value (‘NAV’) per share is a measure of the value of the company per share, calculated by dividing net assets by the number of shares in issue, adjusting for shares 
held by the Employee Share Trust and for dilution by the exercise of share options and awards, detailed in note 16 of the financial statements. NAV per share takes account 
of dividends on the ex-dividend date.
3.  NAV total return is a measure showing how the NAV per share has performed over a period of time, taking into account both capital returns and dividends paid to 
shareholders. NAV total return assumes that dividends are reinvested at the NAV per share on the ex-dividend date.
4.  Annual dividends are dividends declared as part of the company’s recurring dividend cycle and are typically paid out of earnings in a financial year. Annual dividend growth is the 
geometric progression ratio that provides a constant rate of increases over the period. Special dividends are non-recurring dividends declared separate from annual dividends.

Chairman’s and Chief Executive’s report
Results
Caledonia’s net asset value per share total return 
(‘NAVTR’) was 18.0% for the year ended 31 March 2017 , 
following 2.6% for the previous year. All four of the 
investment pools produced double digit returns. 
Investment income for the year was £47.3m, a fall 
of £3.4m compared with the unusually high level of 
the previous year. Additionally, following a number 
of portfolio realisations, in particular the successful sale 
of Park Holidays, the board is proposing a special dividend 
of 100p per share to be paid alongside an increased final 
dividend for the year. The latter would mark the 50th 
year of consecutive increases of our annual dividend. 
We are both proud of this achievement and determined 
to extend the record for many years to come.
Background to the year 
The year under review was dominated by two important 
events. First, the vote by the United Kingdom to leave 
the European Union and second, the presidential 
election in the United States of America. These events 
were key drivers of both stock market and currency 
movements across the world. Caledonia’s strategy of 
owning a balanced investment portfolio of both UK 
and overseas based companies and funds proved to be 
a sound hedge against what turned out to be a period 
of considerable volatility. Macro-economic factors, 
particularly the devaluation of sterling against most 
other currencies, produced a tail-wind for our portfolio, 
with currency gains contributing 6% of the 18% total 
return for the year. Private equity markets have also 
been buoyant, as demand for high quality businesses 
from funds with huge available resources have driven 
prices to levels not seen since before the financial 
crisis. We took advantage of this by selling several of 
our holdings, most notably Park Holidays, which netted 
£197m for Caledonia and gave us an overall return of 
three times the capital invested in 2013.
Caledonia’s strategy and business model
We aim to grow our shareholders’ capital over the long 
term and to provide an increasing annual dividend, both 
in real terms. We are attracted to the higher returns 
provided by equity investments and particularly in the 
unlisted or private equity markets. However, we are 
aware of the portfolio limitations and risks presented 
by only investing in private equity markets. We therefore 
currently have half our net assets in listed companies, 
focusing on long term international compounding equities 
and income stocks, together with quoted market funds, 
which give us the balanced exposure that we seek in 
terms of geography, sectors and liquidity.

One of the consequences of investing in larger private 
equity investments is that, when sold, large capital sums 
are returned on an irregular basis as demonstrated by 
the £207m of cash on our balance sheet at the year end. 
Caledonia’s objective is to ensure that its annual 
dividend payment is set at a level that is covered 
by income. However we recognise that shareholders 
are rewarded with a relatively low annual yield, which 
we address through the occasional payment of special 
dividends when appropriate. This year’s proposed 
special dividend will have the effect of increasing the 
yield averaged over the past five years from 2.9% to 
3.6%, and to 3.2% averaged from 1987, a period that 
included several business cycles and special dividends 
paid to shareholders, as illustrated in the following chart.

Geographic exposure
Caledonia takes a global approach to investment, 
actively seeking exposure to markets that grow faster 
and are less mature than the UK. We access these 
in two ways. First by investing in companies that 
themselves operate across the globe and second 
by selecting funds that specialise in the regions and 
sectors to which we wish to be exposed. In particular, 
we gain access to the US and Asian private equity 
markets via specialist funds operating there. These 
offer attractive returns, even after paying fees to the 
managers, and provide good diversification to the UK 
based majority owned businesses within our portfolio.

Risk
Our approach to risk stems from an understanding that 
shareholders’ capital is a precious commodity which 
we are not required to grow at an unsustainable rate. 
Instead, we aim to produce steady rates of capital 
return over the long term, underpinned by increasing 
annual receipts of dividend. We therefore invest in 
companies that have strong competitive positions 
in their markets and can generate consistently high 
margins, which in turn drive strong returns on capital 
over long time periods. This capital is recycled into 
their businesses further driving growth. Valuations will 
fluctuate over time, but by being invested in companies 
that compound their earnings in this way and which are 
not at risk through excessive gearing, we are confident 
that our returns over the long term will be at least as 
good as the market, but with less risk. 
We carefully review the composition of our portfolio 
to ensure that we are not overexposed to individual 
sectors, geographies or currencies. We also consider 
valuations, gearing and volatility as well as the continuing 
health of the underlying businesses and their sectors 
in assessing their place in the portfolio. We tend not to 
be a frequent buyer or seller of shares and the turnover 
of shares within our portfolio is very low compared 
with market funds.
Investment performance
The construction of the portfolio as described means 
that we do not seek to correlate our performance with 
the market. The board believes that it is better to 
compare returns with inflation to measure our short  
term performance. Over short periods we use a target 
range of RPI+3% to RPI+6%, but over ten years it is 
appropriate to benchmark our performance against 
the FTSE All-Share.
The table below shows a summary of performance 
against RPI for periods up to ten years and against the 
FTSE All-Share for ten years:

FTSE All-Share Total Return 5.7 
Performance vs FTSE 0.4
Currency
The contribution of foreign currency gains to our overall 
return for the year was 6.0%, accounting for one-third 
of our overall return. We have intentionally positioned 
the portfolio to gain a balanced exposure to different 
currencies and geographies. In general, we do not think 
that it is wise to speculate as to the future movement 
of currencies, nor do we intend to reposition the portfolio 
to ‘lock in’ currency gains made this year. We will continue 
to maintain a balanced exposure to the world’s leading 
economic zones (US, Asia and Europe) and their 
currencies over the long term.
Income and expenses 
Investment income for the year was £47.3m, a fall 
of some 7% compared with the previous year. The 
reduction for the year is principally accounted for by 
the unusually high level of dividends received from the 
Unquoted pool portfolio last year. Underlying investment 
income remains in line with our expectations and we are 
confident our more recent acquisitions will compensate 
for the loss of income from the sale of Park Holidays.
Our ongoing charges ratio for the year was 1.07%, 
compared with 1.01% in 2016, reflecting slightly higher 
staff costs. This includes the costs of a direct unquoted 
market investment team.

Balance sheet and cash
At the year end, our balance sheet was ungeared with a 
net cash position of £207m, compared with an opening 
balance of £23m. We are in the process of renewing our 
banking facilities to ensure that they remain appropriate 
for a company with net assets of £1.9bn. Whilst we have 
used these facilities sparingly in the past, it is important 
that we have the flexibility to cover larger transactions in 
the unquoted arena, the timing of which can be difficult 
to anticipate. They also provide an excellent way to take 
advantage of market downturns and ensure we have 
capital available for private equity fund drawdowns.
Review of portfolio
The investment pools returned 20.7% for the year 
under review. It was a year of net divestment, with 
£418m of sales excluding movements within the 
Income pool. Alongside the £197m received from the 
sale of Park Holidays, we received significant proceeds 
from the sales of Bowers & Wilkins, Close Brothers and 
Capital Today China, the Chinese private equity fund 
that backed JD.com from a start-up. Excluding 
movements within the Income pool, we invested 
£230m over the past year, including £74m in the 
Liberation Group, the Channel Islands and UK based 
pub and brewing company. In addition, over £100m 
was invested in our private equity and quoted market 
funds in Asia and the US.

returns. Despite the immature private equity portfolio

The Funds pool was a net investor for the year. Both 
the Quoted and Unquoted pools were net divestors, 
which at the year end drove our cash deposits to 11% 
of NAV. As a consequence, both pools are at the lower 
end or below their strategic allocation ranges. The 
Income pool is also below its target, though we do 
not feel under pressure to rectify this with markets 
at current high valuations. We will deploy capital 
into businesses which fit our strategy when they are 
available at acceptable valuation levels. The Funds pool 
strategy includes a programme of commitments to 
invest in private equity funds. These are drawn down 
when the funds find suitable investments, though are 
reasonably predictable over the long run on a portfolio 
basis. This programme is still relatively immature, such 
that we predict that we will be net investors for a 
further three to four years before returns of capital 
start to match new drawdowns.

5 Annual report 2017 Caledonia Investments plc  
Overview of pool performance
Quoted (£468m, 25% of net assets)
We invest in high quality companies that have 
compounding business models and barriers to entry, 
and which make good use of capital. Experience shows 
that a concentrated and risk managed portfolio 
containing this type of company will deliver better risk 
adjusted returns than the market over the longer term.
The Quoted pool produced a return of 20.6% for the 
year. Strong investment gains were made by nearly all 
of the 18 core holdings that make up the portfolio. UK 
engineers Spirax Sarco and Hill & Smith were 
beneficiaries of the fall in sterling but also produced 
excellent underlying results, which were reflected in 
strong share price performance over the year. Hill & 
Smith has finally gained the recognition of the market 
for its consistent growth in earnings and high margins. 
The US holdings, such as Microsoft, Philip Morris, Becton 
Dickinson and Flowserve, were notable performers, as 
was Jardine Matheson, which operates predominantly 
in Southeast Asia. 
We sold our holdings in Close Brothers and 
LondonMetric Property, amongst others. Close 
Brothers remains a high quality and well run bank but 
we believe that the valuation and point in the cycle 
gave reasons for concern. We first invested in Close 
Brothers in 1987 and it became an outstanding creator 
of value for Caledonia’s shareholders, producing an IRR 
over 30 years of 16.4%. Bristow Group, the US 
helicopter operator, had another year of poor 
investment returns. The oil and gas industry is currently 
in a cyclical downturn and, despite the company’s 
search and rescue contracts, helicopter usage remains 
low. Two new holdings were instigated this year, but 
valuations remain high so other targeted companies in 
which we would like to invest continue to trade outside 
our price ranges.
Income (£216m, 11% of net assets)
A portfolio of global equities that produces a reliable 
and increasing income stream.
The Income pool produced a creditable return of 17.0% 
for the year, including a 4.8% dividend yield. Despite 
the increase in capital value which has led to a fall in 
the market yield, we have increased the running yield 
on the portfolio to 4.8% from 4.2% in the previous 
year. The portfolio consists of 22 companies and has 
produced an annualised return of 7.9% over the past 
two years and 9.6% since inception in 2011. The Brexit 
vote impacted a number of the portfolio companies 
that have businesses which operate solely in the UK, 
such as Royal Mail and Greene King. These are well 
balanced however by US and European holdings.
Unquoted (£568m, 30% of net assets)
We invest in unlisted businesses which require capital 
and an investor with a balance sheet who is able to 
provide a long term perspective. We invest in both 
majority and minority positions.
The Unquoted pool 
performance of 20.8% 
for the year comprised 
a capital return of 17.7% and an income return of 3.1%. 
The undoubted highlight was the sale of our 81.5% 
stake in Park Holidays to Intermediate Capital Group. 
We received cash proceeds of £197m which, when 
added to dividends received, represented 2.9x our 
original investment and an IRR of 44%. This company 
was a good fit with our investment criteria, was run by 
a very capable team of experienced managers and was 
one that, in normal circumstances, we might have held 
for considerably longer. However, we judged that the 
strong profits growth during the period of our 
ownership combined with high valuations for quality 
companies were compelling reasons to sell. We also 
sold our holding in Bowers & Wilkins and a number 
of smaller legacy assets during the year. Total sale 
proceeds and income received was £262m for the year.

C h a i rm a n ’ s 	 a n d 	 C h i e f 	 Ex ecu ti v e ’ s 	 r e p o rt 	 co n tinu ed
We made one new 
investment – Liberation 
Group in July 2016. We 
invested an initial £71m 
for a 97.9% equity stake 
(management own the 
remainder), valuing the company at £118m in total. 
Liberation Group is a pub, restaurant and drinks 
business with its roots in the Channel Islands. In 2015, 
it purchased the Butcombe brewery together with a 
number of pubs in South West England. It had 100 pubs 
in total on acquisition and the strategy is to expand the 
number of pubs on the mainland from the Bath/Bristol 
area to the south west along the axis of the A303. 
We were attracted to the combination of a solid asset 
backed business in which we can continue to invest 
capital at a good rate of return in the future. It is managed 
by an experienced team from the industry and they 
have hit the ground running, buying nine pubs since 
our acquisition.
The existing Unquoted 
pool portfolio has traded 
broadly in line with 
budget during the year. 
Of particular note is the performance of Seven 
Investment Management, which has increased assets 
under management and profits ahead of budget, and 
Gala Bingo, which has traded in line with our 
expectations at the time of the acquisition 18 months 
ago. Cobepa produced a strong investment return for 
the year and, being euro denominated, we also saw a 
currency uplift. It is currently Caledonia’s largest 
holding, albeit diversified through a portfolio of 14 
businesses. Choice Care, the care 
homes operator, has almost 
completed a carefully managed 
expansion plan, adding about a 
third to its capacity. We are very 
aware of the danger of 
expanding too quickly and overstretching the capability 
to deliver top quality care, which remains, above all 
else, the number one priority. The pricing environment 
remains tough, with local authorities under great 
pressure to cut spending however, despite this, new 
bed spaces are being filled at acceptable margins. 
Sterling Industries is starting to see some recovery in 
its core markets of iron and steel and oil and gas, but 
had a difficult year with profits down sharply.
We reviewed well 
over 200 investment 
opportunities during the 
year, making two offers 
with one new investment 
and two follow-on investments. There is a significant 
amount of capital in the market chasing a small supply of 
high quality deals, which has inevitably led to increased 
valuations. We believe in buying the right business for the 
right price and try to use the competitive advantage over 
private equity funds brought by investing our own 
balance sheet (and thereby not being constrained by 
the period of time over which we can own a business), 
which management teams often find appealing.
Funds (£404m, 21% of net assets)
We invest in both private equity and quoted market 
funds, with an emphasis on providing exposure to areas 
of the world where we are less willing to invest directly.
The Funds pool produced an excellent return for the 
year of 23.1%. Quoted market funds, focused on Asia 
and the US, represented 42% of pool assets at the year 
end. We deployed capital into Asia when sentiment was 
very much against the region two years ago and the 31% 
return this year has vindicated this decision. It remains 
one of the few areas of the world that is not fully valued. 
The money is looked after by five different managers 
across the two regions in a mixture of strategies.
The private equity portfolio continues to grow with 
£79m invested this year into a portfolio now valued at 
£235m. We received £53m of distributions from private 
equity funds following portfolio sales, although half of 
this came from further sales of JD.com by Capital Today 
China. We have total outstanding commitments of 
£293m, about 80% of which we expect to be drawn 
down over the next seven or eight years depending on 
the nature of the cycle. The programme is anchored by 
several fund of funds relationships, especially in Asia, 
which has a nascent private equity market. We believe 
this to be a sensible risk mitigant, as well as a good way 
to stay fully informed of, and close to, the market.

7 Annual report 2017 Caledonia Investments plc  
Dividend 
The board is recommending to shareholders a final 
dividend of 39.9p per share, giving a total for the year 
of 54.8p per share, an increase of 4.2% over 2016. 
This will be the 50th year of unbroken annual increases. 
The dividend is a vital component of our return to 
shareholders and, as explained earlier, the strategy 
of the company is focused on its maintenance and 
gradual increase. The proposed final dividend will 
amount to £29.1m.
The board is also proposing to pay a special dividend 
of 100p per share alongside the final dividend, at an 
amount of £54.9m. As explained earlier, the board 
considers it appropriate to augment the long term yield 
offered to investors through the payment of occasional 
special dividends when the company’s long term 
business model delivers cash in excess of its strategic 
investment plans.
Discount
Over the year, the share price rose by 20% and the 
discount of the share price to NAV per share ranged 
between 13% and 26%. We review the valuations of our 
unquoted holdings in September and March each year 
and announce the NAV per share figures shortly after 
the relevant month end, which means that our discount 
can fluctuate in the few days in between until the share 
price adjusts to the updated NAV per share figures.
We did not buy back any shares during the year, but will 
again seek the necessary permissions from shareholders 
at the AGM to do so should they offer particular value.
Board
Rod Kent, who has been a member of the board since 
2011 and Chairman since 2012, has decided to step 
down at the AGM. The company, shareholders and past 
management of Caledonia owe him an unrepayable 
debt of gratitude for his outstanding contribution over 
many, many years. 
Rod first came into contact with Caledonia in the early 
1980s when British & Commonwealth (‘B&C’) was its 
largest investment. He advised the company on its exit 
from B&C in 1987 and ensured that the proceeds from 
the sale were received in a form that was as good as 
cash. This proved prescient when B&C sadly went into 
administration in 1990 following the disastrous 
purchase of Atlantic Computers.
Caledonia had become a significant investor in Close 
Brothers, where Rod was managing director, in 1987 
and increased its stake further over the next few years. 
Close Brothers became the cornerstone of Caledonia’s 
investment success over the next 25 years and, combined 
with his continuing advice, the company has continued 
to thrive. He joined the board of Caledonia in 2011 and 
succeeded James Loudon as Chairman in 2012. We 
wish Rod the very best for a long, happy and peaceful 
retirement. David Stewart will succeed Rod as Chairman 
at the AGM in July.
Outlook
The valuations of equities, bonds, property and non-
conventional assets have been driven to high levels by 
unusually low interest rates. Markets look to be 
reaching the final leg of a sustained bull run with 
valuations now looking stretched. The Federal Reserve 
has increased US interest rates twice recently, taking 
the first tentative steps towards normalising monetary 
policy in the world’s largest economy. There are signs 
that the Bank of England is thinking along similar lines 
albeit with the additional complication of Brexit to 
negotiate. If monetary stimulus is removed and the 
cost of capital increases, there will be an equal and 
opposite effect on valuations. Despite this threat and 
events such as the Brexit vote in the UK, markets have 
held firm probably in part due to the promises 
Mr Trump made in his campaign to become President 
of the US. Caledonia’s modus operandi is not to attempt 
to time market falls, but it guides our thinking in 
ensuring that our risk profile is appropriate for this 
stage in the cycle. 
We continue to be invested in companies that will 
generate reliable cash flows in all market circumstances. 
Our long term outlook also makes us wary of excessive 
debt, which can be the downfall of a good business in 
a downturn of the economic cycle. We currently have 
a cushion of cash on the balance sheet which confirms 
our conservative stance, but is also there to take 
advantage of opportunities that we identify. We 
remain confident that we will be able to meet our 
shareholders’ requirements for capital growth and 
income in the future, without needing to expose their 
capital to undue risk.

The Caledonia team
We aim to recruit and retain high 
quality investment executives to 
maintain deal flow and investment 
continuity, who understand and are 
able to execute Caledonia’s 
investment philosophy.
Business network
Essential to support our business, 
our reputation as a supportive and 
constructively involved long term 
investor enables us to develop our 
network of business contacts. They 
assist us to identify opportunities and 
carry out due diligence, as well as 
being invaluable to the management 
of our investee companies.
Strong balance sheet
Our strong balance sheet, with 
no permanent corporate debt, 
allows us the flexibility to invest 
in both private equity and quoted 
opportunities over a longer 
(ten year) timeframe, significantly 
reducing the investment cycle risk.
Reputation
Caledonia’s heritage can be traced 
back to the shipping empire 
established by Sir Charles Cayzer 
in 1878 and still benefits from 
the backing of the Cayzer family. 
Caledonia has been listed on the 
London Stock Exchange since 1960, 
has been an investment company 
since 1987 and an investment trust 
company since 2003.
Investment process
Our investment process is tailored to the nature of each pool. Investment 
opportunities are identified through our business network and company 
research. An initial review will identify opportunities with characteristics 
which meet our strategic risk/return appetite.

Net asset value total return (‘NAVTR’)
NAVTR is a measure of how the net asset value (‘NAV’) 
per share has performed over a period of time, taking 
into account both capital returns and dividends paid 
to shareholders. NAVTR is calculated as the increase in 
NAV per share plus the accretion from assumed 
dividend reinvestment over the period.

NAV per share
NAV per share is a measure of the value of the company per 
share, calculated by dividing net assets by the number of 
shares in issue, adjusting for shares held by the Employee 
Share T rust and for dilution by the exercise of share awards, 
detailed in note 16 of the financial statements.

Net revenue
Net revenue comprises income from investments 
less management expenses and tax. It differs from 
comprehensive income in excluding gains and losses 
on investments and other items of a capital nature.  
This separation of profits and losses is of importance 
to investors in investment trust companies.

The company uses the modified Deitz method as a measure of the performance of an investment or pool over the year. This method divides the gain or loss in value, 
net of external cash flows, by the average capital over the period of measurement.

Net asset value total return (‘NAVTR’)
NAVTR is a measure of how the net asset value (‘NAV’) 
per share has performed over a period of time, taking 
into account both capital returns and dividends paid 
to shareholders. NAVTR is calculated as the increase in 
NAV per share plus the accretion from assumed 
dividend reinvestment over the period.

NAV per share
NAV per share is a measure of the value of the company per 
share, calculated by dividing net assets by the number of 
shares in issue, adjusting for shares held by the Employee 
Share T rust and for dilution by the exercise of share awards, 
detailed in note 16 of the financial statements.

Net revenue
Net revenue comprises income from investments 
less management expenses and tax. It differs from 
comprehensive income in excluding gains and losses 
on investments and other items of a capital nature.  
This separation of profits and losses is of importance 
to investors in investment trust companies.

The company also uses internal rate of return (IRR), being the discount rate that makes the net present value of all cash flows from a particular investment equal to zero, and realisation 
multiples or money returns, being the cumulative returns from an investment divided by the total investment, as indicators of the performance of individual investments on exit.

Our investment process is at the heart of our current 
performance and future prospects. We have an 
unconstrained approach, which allows us to look across 
regions, sectors, size and time horizons. Our research 
and disciplined process is fundamental to our choice 
of investments.
Performance
Our NAV total return for the year was 18.0%, which 
built on a total return of 2.6% in the previous year and 
14.2% in 2015. Over the year, we have developed our 
portfolio through significant new investment, funded 
by opportunistic disposals and managed top-slicing. 
The portfolio has benefited from revaluation and 
realisation gains, as well as high levels of income. 
Our investments, including non-pool investments, 
produced a 20.2% return. After returns on net cash, 
together with management and other expenses, 
NAV total return was 18.0%.
The 20.2% investment return comprised increases in 
the valuation of our investments, together with the 
income that they yielded.

Investment returns
The total return on our pool investments over the 
year was 20.7%, and over total investments, including 
non-pool subsidiary investment entities holding cash 
and receivables, was 20.2%. The principal contributors 
to this performance were as follows:

Other investments 109.8 28.8 138.6 
Total investments 265.7 47.3 313.0 20.2 
The overall return benefited significantly from the 
successful realisation of our investment in Park 
Holidays. We also saw a significant uplift in the 
valuation of Cobehold, Gala Bingo and the Arlington 
US and NTAsset Asian quoted market funds. Seven 
Investment Management contributed £7.7m in 
valuation gains and a substantial dividend of £3.5m.
Partially offsetting these gains, we recorded a small 
number, though individually insignificant, of valuation 
losses in legacy investments, including Sterling Industries 
and Avanti Communications, in difficult markets.
As a result of actively managing risk, Caledonia’s 
one year risk/return ratio (measured using the Sharpe 
methodology) has generally remained favourable to 
that of the FTSE All-Share over the last five years. 
It is, however, notable that the FTSE Sharpe Ratio 
has moved very significantly in the last year and the 
historical return to risk ratio currently indicated may 
reflect an unsustainable pricing of risk.

Investment movements
At the beginning of the year, the overall value of 
our investments was £1,609.2m. After £186.3m of 
net disposals and £265.7m of gains and losses, the 
investments value increased to £1,688.6m at the year 
end. The following chart illustrates the components

Over half of our £247.1m investment in the year was in 
new situations, predominantly comprised of Liberation 
Group in the Unquoted pool and new fund drawdowns. 
During the year, we realised £433.4m, almost half of 
which was accounted for by the sale of Park Holidays.
Net portfolio gains over the year totalled £265.7m, 
comprising £302.5m of gains and £36.8m of losses. 
Around one-quarter of the gross gains were generated 
by Park Holidays. Only a few investments recorded 
losses in the year and these primarily arose in smaller, 
legacy investments, including Sterling Industries and 
Avanti Communications. Overall, net gains were evenly 
spread across the pools except for Income, which 
generated around one-third of the net gains of the 
other pools, reflecting its smaller asset allocation 
and income mandate.

Income pool Income 14.6 
Other follow-on investments 52.1 
117.4 
Total investments 247.1
During the year, we made one substantial unquoted 
investment, being £71.0m for 97.9% of the equity in 
Liberation Group, the Jersey-based pubs and drinks 
business, owning and operating pubs and drinks 
distribution in the Channel Islands and brewing and pubs 
in Southern England. We invested a further £3.4m in 
Liberation Group to support its development plans.
Within the Funds pool, new investments included 
Overlook Partners, an Asian quoted market fund and 
PAG Asia, an Asian private equity fund. In addition, the 
Quoted pool invested £10.3m in Waters Corp, the US 
listed technology development company, and £7.9m 
in Watsco Inc, the US listed biotechnology company.
Follow-on investments included a further £15.4m in 
Philip Morris, the US listed tobacco company, £15.0m 
in Aberdeen US private equity funds, £10.3m in NTAsset 
Asian quoted market funds and £10.0m in Brookshire 
Capital, a UK commercial property investor.
The £14.6m invested through the Income pool reflected 
small adjustments, cementing last year’s restructuring of 
the portfolio to increase yield and reduce volatility, by 
reducing the number of holdings and increasing the 
weighting of businesses domiciled in the UK.
Realisations
Proceeds from realisations during the year totalled 
£433.4m (2016 – £450.7m), summarised as follows:
Name Pool
Proceeds 
£m 
Park Holidays Unquoted 196.9

Bowers & Wilkins Unquoted 24.0

Asia Landmark fund Funds 20.1

Real Estate Investors Quoted 11.1 
Latshaw Group Unquoted 10.6 
Income pool Income 15.1 
Other realisations 58.5 
Total realisations 433.4
Our most significant realisation was within the 
Unquoted pool, where we disposed of our 81.5% fully 
diluted holding in Park Holidays, the UK caravan parks 
operator, for £196.9m to Intermediate Capital Group. 
This investment delivered an IRR of 44% and a money 
multiple of 2.9x over three years. We also realised our 
investment in Bowers & Wilkins for £24.0m and received 
a £10.6m distribution from Latshaw Group, on the sale 
of one of its US manufacturing businesses.
In the Quoted pool, we sold our remaining holding in 
Close Brothers for £31.2m, with which we had been 
associated for 30 years. This long term investment 
provided an IRR of 16.4%. We also realised a total of 
£29.3m from the sale of our legacy, non-core investments 
in LondonMetric Property and Real Estate Investors.
In the Funds pool, we received £25.9m of distributions 
from the Capital Today China Growth fund on further 
sales of its holding in JD.com, the US listed Chinese 
internet retail company, and received £20.1m from the 
redemption of our investment in the Asia Landmark 
quoted market fund, after a one-third increase in value 
over the first half of the year.

Distribution analysis
Pools
The following chart shows the distribution of net assets 
between the pools of capital and cash.
Pool distribution

Quoted pool 25%  2 7 %
Income pool 11%  1 2 %
Unquoted pool 30%  3 9 %
Funds pool 21%  1 9 %
Cash and other  13%  3 %
The table shows a redistribution during the year from 
the Unquoted pool to cash, as a result of the sale of 
Park Holidays, partially offset by the acquisition of 
Liberation Group.
Geography
The following chart shows the distribution of net assets 
between regions. The basis of this analysis is the 
country of listing, country of residence for unlisted 
investments and underlying regional analysis for funds.
Geographic distribution
 2017 2016
United Kingdom 3 8 %  52%
Continental Europe 1 1 %  11%
North America 2 5 %  22%
Asia 1 2 %  11%
Other countries 1 %  1%
Cash and other 1 3 %  3%
The sale of Park Holidays, partially offset by the 
acquisition of Liberation Group, resulted in a significant 
decrease in our current United Kingdom exposure.
Similarly, the net investment in quoted securities and 
fund drawdowns in the US, as well as the significant 
increase in the value of US assets – enhanced by the 
weakening of sterling against the dollar – resulted in 
the increase in US exposure.
The changes in exposures noted were offset against 
cash and other assets, which increased from 3% of 
net assets last year to 13% at the year end.
At the end of the year, non-UK investments accounted 
for 49% of net assets (including net cash). However, 
much of our investment is in multinational companies, 
which generate a large proportion of their revenues 
overseas. The following chart estimates the geographic 
analysis by revenue generation, which shows an 
investment exposure to non-UK economies of 62% 
of net assets.

Performance and analysis
Asset class
The following chart shows the distribution of net assets 
by asset class. Listed securities represented 36% of net 
assets at the year end and unlisted investments 
(companies and funds) in total accounted for 51%.

Private companies 30%  3 9 %
Private equity funds 12%  1 1 %
Quoted market funds 9%  8 %
Cash and other 13%  3 %
Over the year, there was a substantial shift in allocation 
from private companies, and a more limited shift from 
listed equities, to cash. This was due principally to the 
sale of Park Holidays and Bowers & Wilkins, partially 
offset by the acquisition of Liberation Group, and the 
sale of some substantial listed equity holdings, including 
Close Brothers and Union Pacific.
Currency
The following chart analyses net assets by currency 
exposure, based on the currencies in which 
investments or cash and other assets are denominated 
or traded.

The changes in currency exposures over the year 
principally reflected portfolio changes. In particular, the 
sale of Park Holidays, partially offset by the acquisition 
of Liberation Group, and the investment in and 
increase in value of US dollar investments.

The Quoted pool contains significant holdings in well 
managed publicly quoted companies, held for the long 
term. These investments typically offer substance, 
brand, intellectual property and strong market 
positions. We target opportunities that have a long 
term record of return on capital employed and a 
strong asset base. In common with the wider Caledonia 
philosophy, we look to invest in companies whose 
business model emphasises long term accumulation 
of value, consistent with our target returns and risk.
The pool started the year with investments valued 
at £449.3m and ended with a value of £467.9m, with 
£42.0m of investments and £95.1m of realisations 
(2016 – £156.9m and £112.9m respectively) and valuation 
gains and losses of £71.7m. New investments comprised 
£10.3m in Waters Corp and £7 .9m in Watsco Inc, two US 
listed companies, and we added a further £15.4m to our

from our remaining holding in Close Brothers, £21.8m 
from Union Pacific, £18.2m from LondonMetric Property

Including £10.7m of income, the Quoted pool recorded 
a return of 20.6%, following last year’s negative return 
of 7.0%.
Most investments contributed to pool performance, 
with US stocks benefiting from the weakening of the

Over the year, the Income pool invested £14.6m and 
realised £15.1m. Net dividend income during the year 
was £9.7m, representing a net yield of 4.8% on the 
average invested capital.
The Income pool was created in March 2011. Over 
the six years of its existence, the pool has produced 
a return of 65.1%, giving an annualised rate of 8.7%, 
and provided a total £42.0m of income to Caledonia.
The Income pool has benefited substantially from the 
weakening of the pound after the Brexit referendum 
and the surge in the US equity market after the election 
of Mr Trump as US President. However, the portfolio’s 
risk balance is on the cautious side.
In the previous year, the Income pool substantially 
refined its investments, with the goal of increasing 
yield and reducing volatility. The number of holdings 
was reduced and the geographical weighting shifted 
to companies domiciled in the UK or with revenues 
generated in the UK, thereby reducing the impact 
of volatile foreign exchange markets on income and 
returns. The relatively strong growth in US stock values 
had shifted the balance at the year end. The focus has 
been on companies with a resilient earnings model, 
high cash flow generation and a high and growing 
dividend yield. All holdings are of similar size, at 
around £10m in value at the year end.

Investment review continued
Unquoted pool
The Unquoted pool contains both 
majority and significant minority 
holdings in private companies. Our 
focus is on established businesses, led 
by sound management teams, where 
our target investment size of £25m to 
£100m provides a meaningful presence 
and growth capital supporting double 
digit operating margins.
The year has seen significant changes to the Unquoted 
pool, with the investment in Liberation Group and the 
sales of Park Holidays and Bowers & Wilkins. The pool 
NAV decreased over the year, from £646.3m to £567 .8m, 
after £85.1m of investments and £243.4m of realisations 
and valuation gains and losses of £106.5m, most 
significantly from the sale of Park Holidays. Including 
£18.6m of income, the Unquoted pool achieved a return 
over the year of 20.8%, building on a return of 15.2% last 
year and 19.2% in 2015.
On 8 September 2016, we invested £71.0m for 97.9% of 
Liberation Group, the Jersey-based pub, restaurant and 
brewery business, operating in the Channel Islands and 
South West England. We subsequently invested a 
further £3.3m.
On 8 February 2017, we disposed of our 81.5% holding 
in Park Holidays, the UK’s third largest holiday parks 
operator for £196.9m to Intermediate Capital Group plc, 
in a transaction that valued the business at £362m. 
This investment delivered an IRR of 44% and a money 
return of 2.9x over three years.
On 3 May 2016, we disposed of our 20.0% holding 
in Bowers & Wilkins, the UK audio equipment 
manufacturer for £24.0m to EVA Automation Inc, 
a US technology company. This investment delivered an 
IRR of 3.6% and a money return of 1.2x over three years.
The pool performance has again been strong across 
the portfolio, reflecting the strong market positions 
and cash generative nature of the investments.

The Funds pool performed well over the year, achieving 
a total return of 23.1%, following a total return of 5.9% 
in the previous year. All of the established funds 
performed well over the year, with the US quoted 
market and private equity funds showing particularly 
good returns.
The nature of the longer term investment process within 
the Funds pool requires the continuous origination of, 
and investment in, new funds, to ensure both effective 
vintage management and a balance between maturing 
funds and those at the initial stages, where returns are 
naturally phased to later years. Over the year, the returns 
from the investments in mature funds, including those 
managed by Capital Today, Greenhill Capital, CBPE Capital, 
Livingbridge and JF Lehman, more than offset the 
expected early losses from new fund investments.
During the year, we committed to a number of new 
private equity funds. In the Asia Pacific region, we 
committed $60m (£47.8m) to three new funds, and, 
in the US, $60m (£47.8m) to two new funds. In addition, 
we made investments in two Asian quoted market 
funds totalling $30m (£24.3m).
Realisations in the year amounted to £79.4m, comprising 
£26.4m from the redemption of securities and £53.0m 
from fund distributions. Included in the redemption of 
securities were £20.1m from the Asia Landmark fund 
and £6.3m from the Longleaf US UCITS fund. Fund 
distributions included £25.9m from the Capital Today 
China Growth fund, resulting from sales of part of its 
holding in JD.com.

Caledonia’s net assets are significantly exposed to global 
equity markets as a whole and the current year has seen 
significant volatility in the markets, in the aftermath of 
the UK’s Brexit referendum and the election of Mr Trump 
as US President. Although our balanced exposure to 
worldwide markets, through our pool structure and 
our exposure to both quoted and unquoted equity, has 
helped manage risk, we have benefited from rising market 
values and sterling weakness. Our pool investments, 
whilst focused on long term value accumulation, achieved 
a return of 20.7%, compared with the FTSE All-Share 
Total Return of 22.0%. Including non-pool investments, 
comprising subsidiary investment entities holding cash 
and receivables, the return was 20.2%.
Caledonia’s net assets increased to £1,898.8m at 
31 March 2017, from £1,644.3m at the start of the year.

Total return
The company seeks to generate total return from both 
investment income, net of expenses, and long term 
capital growth. For the year ended 31 March 2017 , 
the total return was £288.1m (2016 – £42.8m), of 
which £30.8m (2016 – £34.2m) derived from income 
and £257.3m (2016 – £8.6m) from capital.
Revenue performance
Investment income in the year of £47.3m (including 
£6.4m from non-pool investments) was 6.7% lower 
than last year’s £50.7m (including £0.5m from non-pool 
investments). In 2016, Park Holidays paid a dividend 
of £12.1m to Caledonia. In March 2016, Caledonia 
assigned its right to future dividends from Park 
Holidays to an investment subsidiary. In 2017, Park 
Holidays paid a pre-sale special dividend, of which 
£26.7m was paid to this investment subsidiary. This 
subsidiary is held at fair value and included in the 
net assets of the company, but was not consolidated 
and therefore the dividend income in the year did 
not reflect in the company’s income. TGE Marine 
was sold in 2016, after contributing income of £5.4m.

25 Annual report 2017 Caledonia Investments plc  
These receipts in 2016, not repeated in 2017, were 
partially offset with a first time dividend in 2017 from 
Gala Bingo of £3.2m, an occasional dividend from 
Sports Information Services of £4.5m and a full year’s 
dividend of £3.5m from Seven Investment Management, 
£2.5m higher than in 2016.
Income from non-pool investments of £6.4m comprised 
£5.0m from a subsidiary investment entity, from the 
proceeds of the Park Holidays dividend, and £1.4m in 
loan interest from another subsidiary investment entity. 
Investment income represented a net yield on the 
monthly average portfolio value of 2.5%, compared 
with 3.3% last year.
Capital performance
Valuation gains and losses on investments totalled 
£265.7m (2016 – £12.5m). Overall, the investment 
portfolio generated £302.5m of gains, offset by £36.8m 
of losses. The principal individual gain was £73.2m from 
Park Holidays, arising from its sale. Cobehold increased 
in value by £19.4m, based on the manager’s valuation. 
Gala Bingo increased in value by £11.9m. The Arlington 
and NTAsset quoted marked funds rose in value by 
£11.0m and £10.4m respectively. Against these gains, 
Sterling Industries recorded a loss of £6.2m, reflecting 
slowdown in the areas of manufacturing utilising the 
company’s specialised services.
Overall, across the entire portfolio our investment 
structure provided a good diversified balance to 
volatile markets, with listed and unlisted investments 
recording net valuation gains of £93.9m and £171.8m 
respectively.

The company maintains a prudent valuation approach 
to all investments. Internal valuations of investments 
are conducted in accordance with the International 
Private Equity and Venture Capital Valuation Guidelines. 
Adjustments are normally made to earnings multiples 
to account for points of difference between the 
comparators and the company being valued, most 
significantly reflecting relative marketability and scale. 
Unlisted property and fund investments are based on 
external valuations.
The following chart summarises the source of valuations 
across the portfolio, illustrating that 17% of the portfolio 
value is subject to directors’ valuation in the year:
Portfolio by valuation source
    
Quoted price   4 1 %  
External fund manager   32%  
E x t e r n a l v a l u e r   5 %  
Directors’ valuation   17%  
Recent transaction   5%  
Expenses
Caledonia allocates expenses between revenue 
and capital in order more closely to adhere to the 
Association of Investment Companies’ guidance and 
broader market practice. In addition to transaction costs 
and external performance fees, share-based payment 
expenses are allocated to capital. Caledonia’s share-
based compensation is directly linked to investment 
performance and is therefore properly viewed as an 
expense against gains on investments included in capital.
Caledonia’s ongoing charges methodology reflects the 
purpose of the calculation as a measure of the costs of 
running funds in the absence of any purchases or sales 
of investments and assuming that markets remain 
static throughout the period. In particular, costs 
relating to compensation schemes that are directly 
linked to investment performance are excluded.
Our ongoing charges ratio for the year was 1.07%  
(2016 – 1.01%). The ongoing charges ratio is calculated 
on an industry standard basis, comprising published 
management expenses over monthly average net assets.
Overall, the company’s revenue management expenses 
were higher than last year at £18.5m (2016 – £16.2m). 
This primarily reflected increased staff costs.

Financial review continued
Dividend
We recognise that a reliable source of growing 
dividends is an important part of shareholder total 
return over both the short and longer terms and have 
extended our record of growing annual dividends to 
50 consecutive years.
We paid an interim dividend of 14.9p per share on 
5 January 2017 and have proposed a final dividend of 
39.9p and a special dividend of 100.0p. The total annual 
dividend for the year of 54.8p is an increase of 4.2% 
on last year.
Including the proposed final dividend, the dividends 
to be paid out of revenue earnings for the year ended 
31 March 2017 totalled £30.1m, which was more than 
covered by the net revenue for the year of £30.8m. 
The special dividend totalling £54.9m will be attributed 
to the capital reserve.
Cash flows, liquidity and facilities
Over the year, we moved from opening net cash of 
£22.9m to £207.3m at the year end, principally due 
to the excess receipts of £433.5m from the realisation 
of investments less the £256.2m paid for the purchase 
of investments.
The total cash increase over the year of £184.4m was 
analysed by pool as follows:

At 31 March 2017 , the company had undrawn committed 
facilities of £175m, expiring in April 2018, including 
£50m in its treasury subsidiary. In addition, the company 
had £21.5m of undrawn overdraft facilities.
Treasury management
The Treasury department provides a central service 
to group companies and conducts its operations in 
accordance with clearly defined guidelines and policies, 
which have been reviewed and approved by the board. 
Treasury transactions are only undertaken as a 
consequence of underlying commercial transactions or 
exposures and do not seek to take active risk positions. 
It is Treasury’s role to ensure that the group has 
sufficient available funds to meet its needs in the 
foreseeable future.
To assist this, we maintain rolling three to five year 
committed bank facilities totalling £175m, which 
we periodically use to facilitate investment liquidity, 
without holding permanent debt outside our 
investment portfolio.

Investments are measured at the directors’ estimate 
of fair value at the reporting date, in accordance with 
IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement. Fair value is the 
amount for which an asset could be exchanged 
between knowledgeable, willing parties in an arm’s 
length transaction.
Publicly traded securities
Investments listed in an active market are valued at 
their bid price on the reporting date. When a bid price 
is unavailable, the price of the most recent transaction 
will normally be used.
Unlisted companies
Unlisted company investments are valued by applying an 
appropriate valuation technique, which makes maximum 
use of market-based information, is consistent with 
models generally used by market participants and is 
applied consistently from period to period, except where 
a change would result in a better estimation of fair value.
The value of an unlisted company investment is generally 
crystallised through the sale or flotation of the entire 
business, rather than the sale of an individual instrument. 
Therefore, the estimation of fair value is based on the 
assumed realisation of the underlying business at the 
reporting date, based on the International Private Equity 
and Venture Capital Valuation Guidelines (December 
2015). Recognition is given to the uncertainties inherent 
in estimating the fair value of unlisted companies and 
appropriate caution is applied in exercising judgments 
and making the necessary estimates.
Enterprise value is normally determined using one 
of the following valuation methodologies:
Price of recent investment
Where the investment being valued was recently 
acquired or a recent transaction has taken place, its 
cost or transaction price will generally provide a good 
indication of fair value. This methodology is likely to be 
appropriate only for a limited period after the date of 
the relevant transaction.
Multiples
This methodology involves the application of an earnings 
multiple to the maintainable earnings of the business 
and is likely to be appropriate for an investment in an 
established business with an identifiable stream of 
continuing earnings.
The earnings multiple used is determined by reference 
to market-based multiples appropriate for the 
business and correlating to the period and calculation 
of earnings of the company being valued. The aim is to 
identify comparator companies that are similar in terms 
of risk and growth prospects to the company being 
valued. Earnings multiples are adjusted for points of 
difference between the comparator and the company 
being valued where appropriate, including the ability 
of Caledonia to effect change in the company, the 
liquidity of the respective entities compared with the 
unlisted investment and other risks associated with 
holding an unlisted share.
Maintainable earnings balance reliability and relevance. 
Generally, the latest historical accounts are used unless 
reliable forecast results for the current year are 
available. Earnings are adjusted where appropriate for 
exceptional or non-recurring items and an average of 
more than one year’s earnings may be used to estimate 
maintainable earnings for cyclical or volatile businesses.
Net assets
The net assets methodology is likely to be appropriate 
for a business whose value derives mainly from the 
underlying value of its assets rather than its earnings, 
such as a property holding company or an investment 
business. It may also be appropriate for a business that 
is not making an adequate return on assets and for 
which a greater value can be realised by liquidating the 
business and selling its assets. A third party valuation 
may be used to give the fair value of a certain asset 
or group of assets.

Fund interests
Fund interests refer to participations in arrangements 
to create a designated pool of capital to invest in a 
wider range of assets than is feasible for an individual 
investor and to share the costs and benefits.
Open-ended funds, including investment companies 
with variable capital, typically report regular net 
asset values, which usually provide a reliable basis to 
estimate fair value. If the price reported by the fund is not 
available at the reporting date, the latest available price 
is used and may be adjusted to take account of changes 
or events to the reporting date.
Closed-ended funds include unlisted investment 
companies and limited partnerships. For these 
investments, the fair value estimate is based on a 
summation of the estimated fair value of the underlying 
investments. Fund manager valuation reports may be 
used where there is evidence that the valuation is 
derived using fair value principles and may be adjusted 
to take account of changes or events to the reporting 
date. Adjustment may also be necessary for features 
of the fund agreement not captured in the valuation 
report, such as performance fees or carried interest.
Other investments
Other investments include preference shares, loan 
notes or facilities, options, warrants and treasury 
instruments that are not publicly traded and do not 
form part of an investment in an unlisted company. 
For such investments, appropriate valuation techniques 
are adopted and used consistently.

Caledonia risk governance and structure
Risk management and its governance is the responsibility 
of the board, with the executive given the task of 
ensuring an effective and transparent process to ensure 
risks are identified, documented, assessed and, where 
appropriate, mitigated. The board sets the risk appetite 
within the business model and this is communicated 
through the executive to all those with managerial 
responsibilities. Risks emanate from all parts of the 
business and are considered by all executives as part 
of their work, from origination of investments to 
ongoing monitoring and portfolio management. 
The Audit Committee assesses and monitors the risk 
management processes and structure and specifically 
reviews the controls assurance programme. This 
programme identifies key mitigating controls, tests 
their operation and reports on compliance and 
effective operation. This, together with reports arising 
from the external audit, provides input to the board as 
a whole on the status of the risk management process.

Risk management reporting
Caledonia manages and reports risk through two primary 
areas of focus – an overall business risk report and a 
portfolio investment risk report.
The business risk report considers the wider business 
environment of the group, including business continuity 
planning, IT and cyber security risks, regulatory risks and 
financial control risks. Caledonia manages business risk 
through a number of integrated processes and procedures 
operating throughout the year to provide risk visibility 
to both the executive team and the wider board.
Caledonia risk management process
Risks are identified and assessed through a risk 
dashboard, capturing the most significant business risks 
facing Caledonia and documenting the actions required 
to achieve an acceptable level of risk. The business risk 
dashboard is reported to the board half yearly.
The portfolio investment risk report specifically focuses 
on the more technical areas of investment portfolio 
risk in relation to Caledonia’s investment strategy. This 
includes such risks as investment volatility, value at risk, 
diversification, liquidity and concentration.
Principal risks Mitigation Key developments
Risk level 
change
Strategic
Risks in relation to the appropriateness of the business 
model to deliver long term growth in capital and income 
and the effective communication and delivery of the 
business model.
Strategic risks include the appropriate allocation of 
capital in relation to geographic, sector and currency 
exposures.
The company’s business model and strategy are 
reviewed periodically, against market conditions 
and target returns.
The performance of the company and its key risks are 
monitored regularly by management and the board.
Caledonia reviews its investment strategy 
annually, taking into consideration the 
current and potential future investing 
environment and discussions with 
executives. The investment strategy is 
reviewed and approved by the board.
Investment
Risks in respect of specific investment and realisation 
decisions.
Investment risks include the appropriate research and 
due diligence of new investments and the timely 
execution of both investments and realisations for 
optimising shareholder value.
Pool managers have well-developed networks 
through which they attract proprietary deal flow.
Investment opportunities are subject to rigorous 
appraisals and multi-stage approval processes. Target 
entry and exit events and prices are monitored and 
updated regularly, in relation to market conditions 
and strategic aims.
Pool managers have significantly 
developed their own risk management 
processes during the year. The board 
regularly reviews investment risk at both 
pool and company portfolio level.
Market
Risk of losses in value of investments arising from 
sudden and significant movements in market prices, 
particularly in highly volatile markets.
Caledonia’s principal market risks are therefore equity 
price volatility, foreign exchange rate movements and 
interest rate volatility. An explanation of these risks is 
included in note 21.
Market risks and sensitivities are reviewed weekly and 
actions taken to balance appropriately risk and return.
A regular review of market and investment volatility 
and value at risk is conducted by the board. Reviews 
also consider investment concentration, currency 
and liquidity exposures.
Caledonia benefited from its global focus 
during the Brexit period, but has remained 
significantly invested in the UK, largely 
through the Unquoted pool.
Caledonia liaises closely with advisers to 
ensure that it understands the landscape 
arising from the impending Brexit and 
how this might impact its business.
Liquidity
Risk that liabilities cannot be met or new investments 
made due to a lack of liquidity. Such risk can arise 
from not being able to sell an investment due to lack 
of a market or from not holding cash or being able 
to raise debt.
Detailed cash forecasting for six months ahead is 
updated and reviewed weekly, including the expected 
drawdown of capital commitments.
Loan facilities are maintained to provide appropriate 
liquidity headroom. The liquidity of the portfolio is 
reviewed regularly.
We have continued to manage our 
investment process to ensure we minimise 
the need to access our available facilities. 
At 31 March 2017, following the sale of 
Park Holidays, we had net cash of £207m 
and undrawn, committed borrowing 
facilities of £175m, which are in place 
up to April 2018.
Operational
Risks arising from inadequate or failed processes, 
people and systems or from external factors.
Operational risks arise from the recruitment, 
development and retention of staff, systems and 
procedures and business disruption. 
Systems and control procedures are developed and 
reviewed regularly. They are tested to ensure 
effective operation.
Appropriate remuneration and other policies are in 
place to encourage the retention of key staff. Business 
continuity plans are maintained, using an offsite facility.
We have operated from our temporary 
offices in Stratton House throughout 
the year and plan to move back to our 
refurbished property in Buckingham Gate 
in summer 2017.
The board has reviewed and approved our 
business continuity plans during the year.
Regulatory and legal
Risk arising from exposure to litigation or fraud and 
adherence to the tax and regulatory environment. 
Caledonia operates across a number of jurisdictions 
and in an industry that has been subject to increasing 
regulation.
Caledonia has internal resources to consider all 
regulatory and tax matters as they arise. Use is made 
of advisers and the Association of Investment 
Companies, of which Caledonia is a member and 
on whose self-managed investment trust committee 
it is represented. Regular training is undertaken.
There have been no significant additional 
regulatory requirements in the year.

32 Annual report 2017 Caledonia Investments plc  
We are committed to building our 
business for the long term. T o this end, 
we consider the impact of our business 
on the marketplace, workplace and 
environment.
Marketplace
As an investment company, we are committed to 
a long term investment strategy and to maintaining 
effective relationships with those companies in which 
we invest. We take board seats in our unquoted 
investments and use these to maintain close 
relationships with managements of those companies. 
Additionally, we hold frequent meetings with 
managements and review internal documents, 
such as management accounts and reports.
We also make considered use of our voting rights. 
As a consequence of our involved investment style, 
we would expect to vote in line with management 
recommendations, but are prepared to abstain or 
vote against recommendations where we consider  
they are not in the interests of our shareholders.
We continue to meet with our shareholders and listen 
to any concerns they may have.
Workplace
Caledonia has in place a set of polices intended to 
protect employees from unlawful discrimination, offer 
them a working environment where they have a right 
to be treated fairly, with consideration and respect, 
and support high standards of conduct and performance. 
These policies assist in ensuring that the company 
meets applicable health and safety standards and 
treats disabled employees in accordance with its 
statutory obligations. These policies are communicated 
to employees by way of a staff handbook provided at 
the time of joining, with periodic updates thereafter.
In addition to a grievance procedure, which allows 
employees to raise concerns either formally or informally, 
there are formal whistleblowing arrangements in place, 
which enable members of staff to raise any issue of 
concern regarding possible impropriety in the conduct of 
the company’s business, confidentially and independently 
of line management.
A formal performance appraisal process, through 
which employees may be set objectives on an annual 
basis and their achievement against those objectives 
assessed at the end of the year, is intended to ensure 
that employees have a clear view of their performance 
and the ability to develop their potential within the 
company through additional training where necessary. 
Together with team meetings and company-wide 
briefings, this provides staff with the opportunity 
to be closely involved in the success of the business.

Environment
Caledonia’s environmental impact is limited. However, 
any measures taken to reduce this impact demonstrate 
the company’s commitment to improve the environment 
and can have direct benefits through reductions in costs 
for energy and consumables. 
For Caledonia, the bulk of its energy saving will 
come from the refurbishment of Cayzer House, 
which will replace the systems for maintaining the 
office environment as well as replacing the fabric of the 
building with modern, more energy efficient, materials.
Other measures undertaken include:
•	the use of electronic communications to save paper, 
printing consumables and energy
•	recycling of office waste, used paper and other 
consumables.
Greenhouse gas emissions
Caledonia’s carbon footprint has been estimated in 
line with the WRI/WBCSD Greenhouse Gas Corporate 
Accounting and Reporting Standard (GHG Protocol) 
and Defra guidelines.
The sources of greenhouse gas emissions shown in the 
table below are from the companies included in the

Statement of compliance
The board recognises the importance of good corporate 
governance and this report describes how the company has 
complied with the UK Corporate Governance Code (‘Code’) issued 
in September 2014 for the duration of the reporting period.
The company has complied throughout the year with all of the 
provisions of the Code, other than provisions B.6.2 and D.1.1. 
Provision B.6.2 requires that the evaluation of the boards of 
FTSE 350 companies should be externally facilitated at least 
every three years. The company last engaged an external 
facilitator for its 2014 board evaluation and therefore, to 
comply with the Code, should have done so again for its 2017 
review. However, in view of the change of Chairman that will 
take effect from the conclusion of the 2017 annual general 
meeting, the board decided that more value would be gained 
by deferring external facilitation until after the chairmanship 
succession to enable the facilitator to consider the dynamic of 
the board under its new leadership. Accordingly, an external 
facilitator will be engaged for the 2018 board evaluation.
Provision D.1.1. requires that schemes for performance-related 
remuneration should include provisions that would enable the 
company to recover sums paid (‘clawback’) or withhold any 
sums due (‘malus’) and specify the circumstances in which it 
would be appropriate to do so. Malus provisions were 
introduced into Caledonia’s performance share scheme and 
deferred bonus plan in 2014 and were included in the directors’ 
remuneration policy approved by shareholders at the annual 
general meeting in that year. The provision in the Code 
requiring malus and clawback did not become operative until 
after the 2014 directors’ remuneration policy had been 
approved and the Remuneration Committee had been advised 
that it would be necessary to seek shareholder approval of a 
change in the remuneration policy for clawback provisions to 
be included in the company’s incentive plans. Accordingly, in 
line with the GC100 guidance, the Remuneration Committee 
resolved to incorporate clawback provisions into Caledonia’s 
incentive plans as part of the next scheduled remuneration 
policy renewal. Such provisions are therefore included in the 
2017 directors’ remuneration policy, for which shareholder 
approval is being sought at this year’s annual general meeting. 
A copy of the Code is available on the website of the Financial 
Reporting Council at https://www.frc.org.uk/Our-Work/

Governance-Code-2014.pdf.

The board
Overall responsibility and operation
The board as a whole is collectively responsible for the success 
of the company and for supervising its affairs. It sets the 
company’s strategy, ensures that the necessary financial and 
human resources are in place to enable the company to meet 
its objectives and reviews management performance. It also 
defines the company’s culture and sets the company’s values 
and standards to ensure that its obligations to its shareholders 
and others are understood and met. It aims to provide 
leadership of the company within a framework of prudent and 
effective controls, which enables risk to be assessed and 
appropriately managed.
To assist its operation, the board has adopted a Schedule of 
Authorities which sets out those matters which it specifically 
reserves for its own decision and those which are delegated to 
board committees and to executive management. Matters 
reserved for the board’s own decision include the following: 
•	 the appointment and removal of directors of the company, 
as prescribed by the company’s articles of association, and 
of certain senior executive positions
•	 the terms of reference of board committees and the 
membership thereof
•	 the company’s strategy
•	 annual budgets
•	 the company’s systems of risk management and internal control
•	 treasury policies, banking counterparties and counterparty 
exposure limits
•	 directors’ remuneration and terms of appointment 
•	 significant capital transactions
•	 political donations.
The roles of the Chairman and the Chief Executive are 
separated and clearly defined in the Schedule of Authorities. 
The Chairman is primarily responsible for the leadership of the 
board to ensure that it carries out its role effectively and for 
succession planning. The Chief Executive is responsible for the 
implementation of the board’s strategy and policies and the 
management of the company’s activities, other than those 
matters specifically reserved to the board. The Schedule of 
Authorities is reviewed annually by the board.
All directors receive detailed papers in advance of board 
meetings to enable them to discharge their duties. They also 
have unlimited access to senior management should further 
information be required and presentations by investment pool 
managers and other senior executives are regularly given to the 
board. The board also attends an annual conference and dinner 
with the senior executives of Caledonia’s unquoted portfolio 
companies, which include presentations on specific issues 
facing their businesses and give board members the opportunity 
to meet the management teams of the Unquoted pool investee 
companies, both formally and informally. 
Appointment, induction and training
The company complies with the recommendation of the Code 
that all directors of FTSE 350 companies should be subject to 
annual election by shareholders.
On appointment, new directors are offered induction and 
training considered appropriate by the board, and subsequently 
as necessary, and the annual performance evaluation of the 
board encompasses the identification of any individual training 
needs of board members so that, if necessary, these can be 
reviewed by the Chairman with the directors concerned. The 
directors receive briefings at board meetings on regulatory and 
other issues relevant to the company and its business sector 
and, in addition, may attend external courses to assist in their 
professional development.
Board composition
The biographies of the directors appear on pages 34 and 35.
The board currently comprises ten directors. Excluding the 
Chairman, three of the directors are executive and six are 
non-executive. The board considers all of the non-executive 
directors to be independent, other than The Hon C W Cayzer, 
who was an executive director prior to becoming non-
executive. In assessing Mr Boël’s independence, the board took 
account of his position as Chief Executive Officer of Sofina SA, 
which has a 5.1% shareholding in Caledonia. Mr Boël’s position 
at Sofina has not given rise to any conflicts of interest and his 
circumstances very much accord with the importance that 
Caledonia attaches to its own executives having board 
positions at, or close contact with, investee companies.
Since August 2015, Mr Bridges has been Group Chief Financial 
Officer of Nex Group (previously ICAP), where Mr Gregson 
is non-executive Chairman. The board does not consider that 
Mr Bridges’ role has any influence on either his, or Mr Gregson’s, 
ability to exercise independent judgement in relation to the affairs 
of Caledonia, which has no other connection with Nex Group. 
Mrs Jemmett-Page was Caledonia’s audit partner at KPMG 
Audit Plc from November 1995 to March 2001. The board does 
not consider that this affects her independence given the length 
of time that has elapsed since this role ended and also the fact 
that none of the current board members, other than The Hon 
Charles Cayzer, were in post whilst she was audit partner.
Board committees
The board has delegated certain specific areas of responsibility 
to the following standing committees – the Nomination 
Committee, the Audit Committee, the Governance Committee 
and the Remuneration Committee. Further details of the work 
of each of these committees and their membership during the 
year are set out on pages 40 to 63.
The terms of reference of each committee are reviewed 
annually and are available on the company’s website.

38 Annual report 2017 Caledonia Investments plc  
Other committees
Various other committees have been established with 
responsibility for specific areas of the company’s activities, 
other than matters reserved to the board as a whole, as follows:
•	 The Administrative Committee of the board has been 
established to deal with administrative matters of a routine 
nature requiring board approval or matters which are reserved 
to the board, but for which board approval has already been 
given in principle. The Administrative Committee meets when 
required and comprises any two directors.
•	 The Executive Committee meets when required and 
is responsible for matters relating to the day to day 
management of the company’s business, other than where 
delegated to other committees. It is chaired by the Chief 
Executive and other members comprise the Chairman, 
the executive directors, the heads of the pools of capital 
and the Company Secretary.
•	 The Investment Management Committee meets fortnightly 
and considers matters relating to the company’s investment 
portfolio and monitors the company’s cash requirements 
and its net asset value per share total return performance. 
The Investment Management Committee is chaired by the 
Chief Executive and other members comprise the entire 
investment team, the Company Secretary and the Deputy 
Company Secretary.
•	 The Investment Approvals Committee considers and formally 
approves new investments and proposed realisations. This 
committee meets when required, is chaired by the Chief 
Executive and other members comprise the Chairman, 
the executive directors, the heads of the pools of capital 
and the Company Secretary.
•	 The Compliance Committee meets fortnightly to monitor 
the company’s ongoing compliance with the requirements 
for investment trust status and to approve all investment 
activity from an investment trust compliance perspective. 
It also monitors the potential impact of legal, tax and 
regulatory developments. The Compliance Committee is 
chaired by the Company Secretary and other members 
comprise the Finance Director, the Heads of Tax, Treasury 
and Finance, the Group Financial Controller and the Deputy 
Company Secretary.
•	 The Challenge Committee formally reviews valuations of all 
of the company’s investments at each half-year and full-year. 
It is chaired by the Chief Executive and other members 
comprise the Finance Director, the Head of Finance and 
the Chairman of the Audit Committee. The meetings are 
observed by representatives from KPMG LLP .
Board performance evaluation
The board conducts an annual evaluation of its performance 
and that of its committees and, in accordance with best 
practice, engages an independent third party facilitator to 
assist in this process every three years although, as explained 
above, the scheduled 2017 external facilitation has been 
deferred for a year in view of the forthcoming change of 
Chairman at the 2017 annual general meeting. Accordingly, 
for the year ended 31 March 2017, the evaluation of the board 
as a whole and of its committees was undertaken internally, 
led by the Chairman, and was conducted by inviting individual 
board members to complete questionnaires regarding the 
operation and effectiveness of the board and its committees, 
the responses from which were collated by the Company 
Secretary and discussed at a special session of the board.
The evaluation of the performance of the Chairman was led by 
the Senior Independent Non-Executive Director and involved 
individual discussions with other members of the board. The 
Chairman considered the performance of the non-executive 
directors and that of the executive directors was reviewed by 
the Chairman and the non-executive directors, with the Chief 
Executive also present for the discussion on the other executive 
directors.
The results of the 2017 evaluation process were presented 
in a report to the board. The conclusion was that the board 
operated well in terms of dynamics, different viewpoints, 
relevant knowledge and expertise. It was however recognised 
that it could be strengthened by specific knowledge of private 
equity investing, given the company’s increased strategic 
allocation to the unquoted sector. Further development of the 
board’s visibility of the governance and control environments 
within the larger unquoted portfolio companies was also 
identified as a key action point. 
Directors’ conflicts of interest
Each director has a duty under the Companies Act 2006 to 
avoid a situation where he has, or could have, a direct or 
indirect interest which conflicts, or may possibly conflict, with 
the company’s interests. The Companies Act 2006 however 
allows directors of public companies to authorise conflicts and 
potential conflicts where the articles of association contain a 
provision to this effect. The Companies Act 2006 also allows 
the articles to contain other provisions for dealing with 
directors’ conflicts of interest to avoid a breach of duty.

39 Annual report 2017 Caledonia Investments plc  
There are safeguards in the company’s articles which apply when 
the directors decide whether to authorise a conflict or potential 
conflict of interest. First, only independent directors, being those 
who have no interest in the matter being considered, are able to 
take the relevant decision and, second, in taking the decision, 
the directors must act in a way which they consider, in good 
faith, will be most likely to promote the success of the company. 
The directors are able to impose time limits or conditions when 
giving authorisations if they think this is appropriate.
The board has adopted procedures to address the requirements 
of the Companies Act 2006 in relation to directors’ conflicts 
of interest. Each new director on appointment is required to 
declare any potential conflict situations, which may relate to him 
or her, or his or her connected persons. These are reviewed by 
the board and, if necessary, also by the Governance Committee, 
which then considers whether these situations should be 
authorised and, if so, whether any conditions to such authority 
should be attached.
Each board meeting includes a standing agenda item on 
conflicts of interest to ensure that all directors disclose any new 
potential conflict situations. These are then reviewed, again if 
necessary also by the Governance Committee, and authorised 
by the board as appropriate. A register of directors’ conflicts of 
interest is maintained by the Company Secretary and is 
reviewed annually by the Governance Committee.
Relations with shareholders
The company welcomes dialogue with investors in order 
to achieve a mutual understanding of objectives. The Chief 
Executive and the Finance Director regularly hold meetings 
with institutional investors, private client stockbrokers and fund 
managers. The Chairman and other non-executive directors are 
also available to attend some of these meetings, if requested. 
Any views put forward by shareholders are reported back to the 
board, which periodically also receives presentations from the 
company’s brokers on shareholder feedback and the general 
market perception of the company. In addition, the annual 
general meeting provides a forum for shareholders to meet 
the directors, both formally and informally.
The Chairmen of all of the board’s committees will be available 
to answer questions at the annual general meeting.
Relations with controlling shareholders
As at 24 May 2017, being the latest practicable date prior to 
the publication of this annual report, the Cayzer family concert 
party (‘Cayzer Concert Party’) held 48.48% of Caledonia’s 
voting rights.
Under the Financial Conduct Authority’s Listing Rules, where 
a premium listed company has a controlling shareholder or 
shareholders (being a person or persons acting in concert who 
exercise or control 30% of more of the company’s voting 
rights), the company is required to enter into a written and 
legally binding agreement which is intended to ensure that 
the controlling shareholder undertakes to comply with certain 
independence provisions, namely that:
1.  transactions and arrangements with the controlling 
shareholder (and/or any of its associates) will be conducted 
at arm’s length and on normal commercial terms;
2.  neither the controlling shareholder nor any of its associates 
will take any action that would have the effect of preventing 
the listed company from complying with its obligations under 
the Listing Rules; and
3.  neither the controlling shareholder nor any of its associates 
will propose or procure the proposal of a shareholder 
resolution which is intended or appears to be intended to 
circumvent the proper application of the Listing Rules.
The board confirms that agreements specified under the Listing 
Rules as described above (which were required to be in place 
by 17 November 2014) were entered into by the company on 
30 October 2014 with The Cayzer Trust Company Limited 
(‘Cayzer Trust’) and separately with the Trustee of the 
Caledonia Investments plc Employee Share Trust (‘Employee 
Share Trust’), which is deemed by the Panel on Takeovers and 
Mergers to form part of the Cayzer Concert Party, and remain 
in place. Under the terms of its agreement, Cayzer Trust has 
undertaken to procure the compliance with the independence 
provisions of all of the other members of the Cayzer Concert 
Party, other than the Employee Share Trust.
The board confirms that, during the period under review and 
up to 24 May 2017, being the latest practicable date prior to 
the publication of this annual report:
1.  the company has complied with the independence provisions 
included in the agreements with Cayzer Trust and the 
Employee Share Trust
2.  so far as the company is aware, the independence provisions 
included in the agreements have been complied with by 
Cayzer Trust and the Employee Share Trust
3.  so far as the company is aware, the procurement obligation 
included in the agreement with Cayzer Trust has been 
complied with by that company.

1.  Mr Bridges and The Hon C W Cayzer each absented themselves from one meeting 
which approved the renewal of their letters of appointment.
2.  Mrs Jemmett-Page and Mr Stewart each absented themselves from one meeting 
which established a sub-committee to deal with the Chairmanship succession, for 
which both were candidates.
 
The Nomination Committee is responsible for the regular 
review of the structure, size and composition (including the 
skills, knowledge, experience and diversity) of the board and 
for giving consideration to succession planning for directors 
and, if requested by the board, for other senior executives. It is 
responsible for identifying, using external search consultants 
where necessary, candidates to fill board vacancies as and 
when they arise, for making recommendations to the board in 
relation thereto and for keeping under review the leadership 
needs of the company, both executive and non-executive.
The Nomination Committee also reviews the time required of 
the non-executive directors and ensures that they receive 
formal letters of appointment setting out clearly what is 
expected of them in terms of time commitment, committee 
service and involvement outside board meetings.
Diversity
The board’s policy on diversity is, as it has been in the past, to 
seek to appoint the best qualified person to a particular role 
regardless of gender or other diversity criteria and therefore it 
has not adopted any measureable objectives in relation 
thereto.
Work of the Nomination Committee
The Nomination Committee met three times during the year 
and the work undertaken included:
•	 consideration of the contributions and effectiveness of the 
non-executive directors seeking re-election at the 2016 
annual general meeting, prior to giving recommendations 
for their re-elections
•	 the renewal of expiring letters of appointment for certain 
of the non-executive directors
•	 consideration of potential candidates for the role of Chairman 
to succeed Mr Kent.
Subsequent to the year end, the Nomination Committee 
recommended to the board that Mr Stewart should succeed 
Mr Kent as Chairman, with effect from the conclusion of the 
2017 annual general meeting. In making this recommendation, 
the Nomination Committee did not use an external search 
consultancy nor open advertising, as it considered that 
Mr Stewart’s personal qualities and the breadth of his 
experience in asset management and international business 
made him the most suitable candidate for the role. An external 
search consultancy was however used for Mr Stewart’s 
appointment as a non-executive director in 2015.

The Audit Committee is responsible for monitoring the 
integrity of the financial statements of the company and 
any announcements relating thereto and for reviewing any 
significant financial reporting judgements contained therein. 
In addition, it oversees the relationship with the external auditor, 
KPMG LLP (‘KPMG’). It also reviews the company’s systems of 
internal control and risk management procedures and considers 
annually whether an internal audit function is required.
The Audit Committee, comprised exclusively of independent 
non-executives directors, met three times in the year ended 
31 March 2017, in May and November 2016 and in March 2017. 
Subsequent to the year end, it met in May 2017 to consider 
the significant issues in relation to the 2017 annual report.
The external auditor, KPMG, the Chief Executive, the Finance 
Director, the Company Secretary and members of the finance 
team attend the meetings of the Audit Committee. Other 
board members and/or senior executives may also attend 
meetings at the invitation of the Chairman. At the end of each 
meeting, the Audit Committee has a separate discussion with 
the external auditor without executive management present.
Work of the Audit Committee
The Audit Committee undertook the following activities in the 
discharge of its responsibilities.
Financial statements
The main focus of the meetings in May and November 2016 was 
the 2016 annual report and financial statements and the 2016 
half year results respectively, including evaluation of the going 
concern statement and, in the case of the annual report, the 
viability statement therein.
The March 2017 meeting considered principally the audit 
planning for the 2017 annual report, including in particular 
the requirements of the 2016 revision of the UK Corporate 
Governance Code and other disclosure requirements.
In its May 2017 meeting, the Audit Committee reviewed the 
form and content of the 2017 annual report and financial 
statements. In conducting its review, the Audit Committee 
considered reports prepared by management and the external 
auditor. These reports provided an analytical review of the 
financial statements, comparing the current to prior year 
financial position and results, and detail the judgements 
and sources of estimation uncertainty involved in applying 
the accounting policies to the financial statements. The Audit 
Committee also considered the going concern statement and 
the viability statement. The Audit Committee recommended 
the 2017 annual report to the board.
The significant issues the Audit Committee considered in 
relation to the 2017 financial statements were the valuation 
of  unlisted and listed investments. In relation to these financial 
statements, the Audit Committee also considered the going 
concern statement, the viability statement and compliance with 
the annual report ‘fair, balanced and understandable’ provisions 
of the 2014 revision of the UK Corporate Governance Code.

Unlisted valuations
The Audit Committee recognises that unlisted investments are 
a significant component of the financial statements and that 
their valuation is subject to considerable judgement and 
uncertainty. The Chairman of the Audit Committee attended 
the Challenge Committee meetings (along with the external 
auditor) and reported to the Audit Committee on the quality of 
the review, adherence to the company’s valuation policy and 
consistency of valuation methodologies over time.
Listed valuations
Listed investments are a significant component of the financial 
statements. The Challenge Committee meetings referred to 
above also considered the listed securities, to ensure that the 
exchange bid prices used in the valuation were from an actively 
traded market. The Audit Committee concurred that it was 
appropriate to use the exchange bid price in all cases.
Going concern and viability
The Audit Committee considered the funding needs of the 
company and its financial capacity, including available bank 
credit and liquid funds, to be wholly sufficient to confirm the 
going concern of the business.
The Audit Committee also assessed the viability of the 
company. They agreed to provide a viability statement for a 
period of three years for the reasons set out in the statement 
on page 66. In May 2017, the Audit Committee conducted a 
series of stress tests that considered the impact of severe 
market downturn scenarios on shareholders’ funds, the debt 
facility, investment income and also the potential loss of 
investment trust status. The outcome of this activity led the 
Audit Committee to recommend to the board to make the 
statement on page 66.
Fair, balanced and understandable statement
The Audit Committee reviewed the draft annual report and, 
taken as a whole, considered it to be fair, balanced and 
understandable. To assist in reaching this view, the Audit 
Committee considered a report prepared by management 
highlighting the positive and negative statements included in 
the annual report to ensure that they fairly reflected the results 
for the year. The Audit Committee recommended to the board 
that the Statement of directors’ responsibilities in respect of 
the annual report and the financial statements, set out on 
page 68, should be signed accordingly.
Internal control
In the May and November meetings, a report on the internal 
control reviews performed during the previous six months was 
presented, together with an update on the controls assurance 
programme given at the March 2017 meeting. The Audit 
Committee reviewed the effectiveness of the internal control 
environment and the structure in place to resolve identified 
weaknesses. The Audit Committee agreed the control review 
work plan for 2017.
The board of directors is responsible for the company’s system 
of internal control and for reviewing its effectiveness. The 
system is designed to manage rather than eliminate the risk 
of failure to achieve business objectives and can only provide 
reasonable and not absolute assurance against material 
misstatement or loss.
The Audit Committee recognised the increased regulatory 
risk associated with the investments in the prior year in Seven 
Investment Management and Gala Bingo, both of which are 
regulated entities. The company will closely monitor the 
controls in place in these entities.
Internal audit
As the company does not have an internal audit function, the 
Audit Committee considers annually whether there is a need 
for one. The company is an investment trust and manages its 
non-consolidated subsidiaries as other private company 
investments, expecting them to operate their own risk 
management processes. The company closely monitors the 
control environment of its private company investments. The 
Audit Committee recommended to the board that an internal 
audit function was not required.
Auditor
The Audit Committee last conducted an audit tender process 
in mid-2011. The main outcomes of the process were the 
replacement of Deloitte (who had been the company’s auditor 
since 2006) with KPMG Audit Plc and a plan for the development 
of the external audit approach. The principal planned changes 
were to increase the depth of the audit by reducing the 
materiality level and an increased focus on unquoted 
investment valuations and process. At its request and for 
internal reasons, KPMG Audit Plc resigned as the company’s 
auditor with effect from the conclusion of the annual general 
meeting on 24 July 2013 and was replaced by its immediate 
parent entity, KPMG LLP .

In accordance with professional guidance, KPMG LLP changes 
the audit partner every five years. The current audit partner, 
Thomas Brown, was appointed in 2016.
The Audit Committee has decided that it will put the role of 
auditor out to tender at least every ten years, in accordance 
with the UK Corporate Governance Code and rules from the 
Competition and Markets Authority and EU legislation. Its 
current plan is to complete an audit tender in the financial year 
ended 31 March 2022, being ten years from the date of the last 
audit tender. The Audit Committee believes that the depth of 
knowledge of the company and its investments – in particular 
the majority owned unquoted investments – obtained by 
KPMG LLP over its tenure as auditor puts it in the best position 
to conduct an effective audit for members.
Audit effectiveness
Audit quality is reviewed continuously throughout the year by 
both the Finance Director and Audit Committee. The focus is 
centred on the following:
•	 the quality and seniority of the auditor’s staff
•	 the appropriateness of the planned audit methodology as 
applied to Caledonia’s business activity
•	 the level and challenge and quality of reporting to the Audit 
Committee.
The effectiveness of the audit is also monitored throughout the 
year using a number of measures, including but not limited to:
•	 a review and approval of the scope of the planned audit
•	 the planned implementation of improvements following 
appropriate post audit reviews
•	 the monitoring of the independence of the external auditor
•	 a review of any Financial Reporting Council’s Audit Quality 
Review Report for KPMG’s audit of the company.
Non-audit work
In order to safeguard the auditor’s independence and 
objectivity, the Audit Committee maintains a schedule of 
specific non-audit activities which may not be undertaken by 
the external auditor, within the broad principles that the 
external auditor should not audit its own work, should not 
make management decisions on behalf of the company, should 
not be put into the role of advocate for the company and that 
no mutuality of interest should be created between the 
company and the external auditor.
The Audit Committee reviewed and adopted a revised policy for 
the provision of non-audit services, meeting the requirements 
of the 2016 revision of the UK Corporate Governance Code and 
the FRC Revised Ethical Standard implementing the EU Audit 
Regulation and Directive and the requirements of the 
Competition and Markets Authority’s final Order.
Certain non-audit services are prohibited and permitted 
services are subject to approval by the Finance Director 
and Audit Committee. Total fees payable for non-audit work 
carried out by the company’s auditor are subject to limits.
Re-appointment of KPMG as auditor
KPMG Audit Plc was appointed auditor in 2011 and was replaced 
by KPMG LLP in 2013. The lead audit partner is required to rotate 
every five years – this was done in 2016 – and other key audit 
partners every seven years. No contractual obligations restrict 
the Audit Committee’s choice of external auditor. The Audit 
Committee concluded that KPMG provides an effective audit 
and the Audit Committee recommended to the board the re-
appointment of KPMG LLP .
Resolutions to re-appoint KPMG LLP as auditor and to authorise 
the directors to determine the auditor’s remuneration, will be 
proposed at the annual general meeting on 20 July 2017.
Private meetings
During the year, the Chairman of the Audit Committee met 
separately and privately with the Finance Director and KPMG.
Statement of compliance
This report has been prepared in compliance with the 
Competition and Markets Authority Order 2014 on statutory 
audit services for large companies.

The Governance Committee keeps under review corporate 
governance issues relating to the company and is responsible 
for the monitoring and review of the ability of each director to 
act in the interests of shareholders as a whole and to exercise 
independence of judgement free from relationships or 
circumstances which are likely to, or could appear to, affect 
his or her judgement. 
The Governance Committee also reviews conflict or potential 
conflict situations relating to directors, which may require 
the prior authorisation of the board under the Companies Act 
2006, and makes recommendations to the board as to whether 
such conflict or potential conflict situations should be 
authorised and, if so, whether any conditions, such as duration 
or scope of the authority, should be attached. The Governance 
Committee reviews annually all authorisations previously 
granted by the board to ensure that they remain appropriate. 
If the Governance Committee believes that a director may be 
subject to a conflict of interest which may prejudice his or her 
ability to exercise independence of judgement, it may make 
such recommendations to the board as it may think fit, 
including that the director abstains from participating in any 
decision of the board or any of its committees on the matter 
concerned.
Work of the Governance Committee
The Governance Committee met twice during the year and the 
principal matters it considered were: 
•	 the review and approval of the Corporate governance report 
for the year ended 31 March 2016
•	 the review of potential conflict situations notified by 
directors in accordance with the Companies Act 2006 and 
the making of recommendations to the board in relation 
thereto
•	 consideration of the influence of the Cayzer family concert 
party (‘Cayzer Concert Party’) on Caledonia’s board and 
whether it was in the general interest of the non-Cayzer 
Concert Party shareholders, with the conclusion that it was
•	 the review and approval, on behalf of the board, of the 
statements of compliance with the independence provisions 
of the Listing Rules relating to premium listed companies 
with controlling shareholders.

The Companies Act 2006 requires the company’s auditor to 
report to the shareholders on certain parts of the Directors’ 
remuneration report and to state whether, in its opinion, those 
parts of the report have been properly prepared in accordance 
with the Large and Medium-sized Companies and Groups 
(Accounts and Reports) (Amendment) Regulations 2013. 
The parts of the Annual report on directors’ remuneration 
that have been audited are indicated in that report. The Annual 
statement by the Chairman of the Remuneration Committee 
and the Remuneration policy are not subject to audit.
On behalf of the board, I am pleased to introduce Caledonia’s 
Directors’ remuneration report for the year ended 31 March 2017 .
Remuneration policy
Caledonia’s current policy on directors’ remuneration was 
approved by shareholders in 2014 and therefore, in accordance 
with statute, must be put to shareholders for renewal at the 2017 
annual general meeting. Over the past year, the Remuneration 
Committee has considered how well the current policy is linked to 
the company’s strategy, whether alternative arrangements could 
be implemented to simplify our pay structures, whether the 
overall quantum of directors’ pay is appropriate and whether the 
rewards receivable by management remain closely aligned with 
shareholder experience. This review has been conducted against 
an increasing public debate about executive pay and its future 
direction, both in political circles and in the investor community. 
Focus on this area is likely to continue and could result in 
significant changes in market practice on executive pay, although 
precisely how remains unclear. The Remuneration Committee 
believes that it is important for Caledonia, given its long term 
investment horizon, to maintain consistency in its remuneration 
framework, provided it remains fit for purpose. It will however 
continue to monitor the ongoing public debate and any future 
developments in executive pay.
The Remuneration Committee’s review of the current policy 
confirmed that it remains closely aligned to Caledonia’s business 
model and strategy, the ultimate aim of which is to grow the 
company’s net assets and dividends paid to shareholders in real 
terms over the long term, whilst managing risk to mitigate 
volatility of returns. Specifically, the Remuneration Committee 
considers that the performance measures adopted for the short 
and long term incentive plans underpin the board’s aim to deliver 
consistent annualised returns of between RPI+3% and RPI+6%, 
which history has shown should lead to outperformance of most 
equity markets, and in particular the FTSE All-Share Total Return 
index, over rolling ten year periods. 
The Remuneration Committee is however sensitive to public 
concerns around executive pay, in particular in relation to 
complexity and quantum, and therefore is proposing the 
following refinements to the current policy for the 2017 renewal:
•	 the deferred bonus plan matching share arrangements will 
be discontinued, although any bonus in excess of 50% of basic 
salary will still be deferred into shares for a three year period 
and subject to the usual bad leaver forfeiture provision.
•	 to compensate for the loss of earnings potential under the 
deferred bonus matching scheme (which could deliver up to 
75% of basic salary with maximum compulsory and voluntary 
deferral), the standard annual awards under the 
performance share scheme for executive directors 
will be increased from 125% of basic salary to 150%
•	 as previously indicated, clawback provisions which will, in 
certain circumstances, enable the company to recover amounts 
previously paid, will be introduced for all elements of variable 
pay, in addition to the malus arrangements (which enable the 
company to withhold amounts not yet paid) already in place.

46 Annual report 2017 Caledonia Investments plc  
The Remuneration Committee believes that these refinements 
will both simplify the company’s remuneration structure and 
reduce the maximum amount of pay that could be earned by 
executive directors. By substituting performance share scheme 
awards for deferred bonus matching, a greater proportion of 
variable pay will be subject to a five year performance period, 
which now applies to two-thirds of shares awarded annually 
under the performance share scheme. 
The Remuneration Committee has taken the opportunity to 
consult with some of Caledonia’s larger shareholders and 
certain institutional investor representative bodies on the 
revised remuneration policy. No changes were requested, 
however the Remuneration Committee is nonetheless very 
grateful for the feedback received.
We hope therefore that the revised policy, as set out in full on 
pages 47 to 55 will receive your support at the annual general 
meeting on 20 July 2017. 
Remuneration for the year ended 31 March 2017
The Annual report on directors’ remuneration set out on pages 
56 to 63 describes in detail how the current remuneration 
policy has been applied for the year ended 31 March 2017. 
However, I would like to highlight the following points:
Annual bonus
Strong performance over the year, at company, pool and 
individual level, resulted in maximum bonus awards for all 
executive directors.
Deferred bonus matching awards
The deferred bonus matching awards granted in 2014 reached 
the end of their three year performance period. In aggregate, 
67% of the awards vested, as the two-thirds of the awards 
measured by reference to Caledonia’s net asset value per share 
total return (‘NAVTR’) against the FTSE All-Share Total Return 
index over the period comfortably achieved maximum vesting, 
outperforming by 18.9%, whereas the one-third measured 
against the FTSE Actuaries UK Index-linked Gilts (all-stocks) 
Total Return index (‘Gilts index’) fell short of the minimum 
vesting level by 1.7% and therefore lapsed. The Remuneration 
Committee did consider whether the outcome of the Gilts 
index measure was anomalous given the extraordinary 
performance of the gilts market over the past three years due 
to the effects of quantitative easing and, more recently, the 
Brexit vote and therefore did not provide a fair measure of 
Caledonia’s performance over the period. It concluded, 
however, that it would be inappropriate to change the 
performance target post-grant.
Performance share scheme awards
Half of the performance share scheme awards granted in 
2014 reached the end of their performance period this year. 
Measured by reference to Caledonia’s annualised NAVTR 
over the three year period, these achieved maximum vesting as 
the company’s annualised NAVTR of 11.4% exceeded the 10% 
needed and the Funds pool’s annualised total return (relevant 
for Jamie Cayzer-Colvin’s awards) of 23.7% was well above the 
13.5% needed for maximum vesting. The remaining half of the 
2014 performance share scheme awards will be tested in 2019.
Remuneration for the year ending 31 March 2018
Looking ahead to the 2018 financial year, basic salaries of 
executive directors have been increased with effect from 
1 April 2017 by 2.5%, broadly in line with inflation, which was 
the same as the standard increase given to all of the company’s 
staff. Following a review of non-executive directors’ fees in 
the self-managed investment trust sector and of FTSE 250 
companies generally, the Remuneration Committee has 
decided that, on the appointment of the new Chairman at 
the annual general meeting in July, the Chairman’s fee will 
be reduced from £184,500 to £150,000 per annum. The 
other non-executive directors’ fees have not been changed. 
Subject to shareholder approval of the revised remuneration 
policy, we plan to make performance share scheme and 
compulsory deferred bonus awards following the annual 
general meeting in July in line with the new policy described 
above. The performance share scheme awards will be subject 
to the same performance measures used for the 2016 award 
grants, which are summarised in the notes to the remuneration 
policy table on pages 50 and 51.

Implementation of the policy
The remuneration policy set out below describes the policies, 
principles and practices operated by the company for the 
remuneration of its directors. If approved by shareholders at the  
annual general meeting to be held on 20 July 2017, this policy 
will supersede the policy approved at the 2014 annual general 
meeting and take effect from that date and will then apply until 
a revised remuneration policy is approved by shareholders. 
The company does not expect to seek shareholder approval 
for a revised policy until the annual general meeting in 2020.
Under the current statutory regime, a company may only make 
a remuneration payment to a director or a payment for loss of 
office if it is either consistent with the most recently approved 
remuneration policy or, if not, is separately approved by 
shareholders. The Remuneration Committee considers that an 
effective remuneration policy needs to be sufficiently flexible 
to take account of future changes in the company’s business 
environment, and in remuneration practice generally. In framing 
its policy, the Remuneration Committee has therefore sought 
to combine a level of breadth and flexibility to enable it to react 
to changed circumstances without the need for a specific 
shareholder approval, whilst at the same time incorporating 
sufficient detail and transparency to enable shareholders to 
understand how it will operate in different scenarios and feel 
comfortable that payments made under it are justified. 
Components of remuneration where the Remuneration 
Committee wishes to retain a level of discretion are identified 
in the relevant sections of the policy. The Remuneration 
Committee may also make minor amendments to the 
remuneration policy to aid its operation or implementation 
without seeking shareholder approval, for example to take 
account of a change in legislation or for regulatory, exchange 
control, tax or administrative purposes, provided that any such 
change is not to the material advantage of the directors.
Legacy arrangements
The policy is essentially forward looking in nature. In view 
of the long term nature of the company’s remuneration 
structures – including obligations under service contracts, 
pension arrangements and incentive schemes – a substantial 
number of pre-existing obligations will remain outstanding at 
the time that the new policy is approved, including obligations 
that are ‘grandfathered’ by virtue of being in force at 
27 June 2012 or which were incurred under the previous 
remuneration policy approved by shareholders at the 2014 
annual general meeting. It is the company’s policy to honour 
in full any pre-existing obligations that have been entered 
into prior to the effective date of this policy. 
Objectives
The key objectives of the Remuneration Committee in setting 
the company’s remuneration policy are as follows:
•	 remuneration of executive directors should be linked to the 
company’s long term performance and its business strategy
•	 performance related remuneration should seek to align the 
interests of executive directors with those of the shareholders
•	 a significant proportion of executive directors’ remuneration 
should be linked to the performance of the company and only 
receivable if demanding performance targets are achieved
•	 remuneration packages for executive directors should be 
competitive, but not excessive, in terms of market practice, in 
order to attract, retain and motivate executive directors of the 
quality needed to manage and grow the company successfully.
Remuneration structure
Executive directors
The table below sets out Caledonia’s policy in relation to each component of executive director remuneration, with further 
explanations in the notes that follow.
Salary (fixed pay)
Purpose and 
link to strategic 
objectives

Benefits (fixed pay)
Purpose and 
link to strategic 
objectives
To provide a range of benefits alongside basic salary to recruit and retain high calibre executive directors.
Operation Executive directors are provided with family private medical insurance cover, death-in-service insurance, and 
permanent health insurance and, in the case of Mr Wyatt and Mr Cayzer-Colvin, a cash allowance in lieu of a 
company car. They are also entitled to receive minor benefits that are available to other Caledonia staff.
The executive directors are also covered by the company’s directors’ and officers’ liability insurance policy and 
have the benefit of an indemnity under the company’s articles of association.
Where there is a valid business reason for doing so, the company may pay for the cost of spouses or partners 
accompanying directors on business trips and reimburse directors for hotel accommodation and travel 
expenses (including payment of any tax thereon). Executive directors are also eligible to receive other minor 
benefits and expenses payments (again including payment of any tax thereon).
Opportunity 
and recovery 
or withholding 
provisions
A taxable benefits package that is competitive with the marketplace. 
The value of taxable benefits provided, other than ad hoc items incurred in connection with Caledonia’s 
business that may be deemed taxable benefits such as travel and other expenses, will not in aggregate exceed 
10% of basic salary.
No recovery or withholding provisions.
Performance 
measurement 
framework
Not applicable.
Short term incentives (variable pay)
Purpose and 
link to strategic 
objectives
To reward performance on an annual basis against key financial, operational and individual objectives. 
Operation Discretionary annual bonus scheme and deferred bonus plan under which a proportion of bonus may be 
compulsorily deferred into shares.
Bonus is not pensionable.
Opportunity 
and recovery 
or withholding 
provisions
The maximum potential bonus is 100% of basic salary. Any bonus over 50% of basic salary is compulsorily 
deferred into shares for a period of three years. 
All bonus payments are subject to the overriding discretion of the Remuneration Committee, which also retains 
discretion to amend the proportions of bonus subject to compulsory deferral or not to require any deferral.
In order to be entitled to an annual bonus, an executive director must normally be in the group’s employment 
and not under notice of termination (either given or received) at the time the bonus is paid.
The Remuneration Committee has the right to cancel or reduce any cash bonus or deferred bonus shares 
granted after the effective date of this policy which have not yet been paid or vested, in the circumstances 
described under long term incentives below.
The Remuneration Committee also has the right to recover all or part of cash bonus paid or deferred bonus 
shares and dividend equivalent amounts awarded after the effective date of this policy within the two years 
following date of payment or vesting as applicable, in the circumstances described under long term incentives 
below.
Performance 
measurement 
framework
By reference to a combination of company performance against external benchmarks and individual 
performance against personal objectives. Executive directors with responsibility for pools of capital will have a 
proportion of bonus determined by reference to pool performance and objectives.

Long term incentives (variable pay)
Purpose and 
link to strategic 
objectives
To motivate executive directors to deliver long term shareholder value, thereby aligning the interests of 
management with those of shareholders.
To encourage long term retention of key executives.
Operation Caledonia operates a performance share scheme under which participants are awarded nil-cost options over 
the company’s shares.
The performance share scheme replaced an executive share option scheme under which market value options 
were awarded to senior executives. The last awards under the executive share option scheme were made in 
2010, although Mr Cayzer-Colvin retains options under this scheme which have yet to be exercised. 
Prior to the effective date of this policy, under the company’s deferred bonus plan, matching share awards were 
granted in respect of compulsory and voluntary deferral of pre-tax bonus, some of which remain outstanding. 
Opportunity 
and recovery 
or withholding 
provisions
The maximum value of nil-cost options that may be granted in any year under the performance share scheme 
rules is 200% of basic salary, although the company’s policy is to grant annual awards of no more than 150% of 
basic salary.
On exercise of nil-cost options, participants will also receive an amount equivalent to the dividends and, if 
relevant, any associated tax credits that would have accrued on the shares during the relevant performance 
measurement period.
The Remuneration Committee has the right, in respect of awards granted after 1 April 2014, to cancel or reduce 
long term incentive awards which have not yet vested, in the event of a material misstatement of the company’s 
financial results, miscalculation of a participant’s entitlement, individual misconduct or an event resulting in 
material loss or reputational damage to the company or any member of the group.
The Remuneration Committee also has the right, in respect of awards granted after the effective date of this 
policy, to recover all or part of the value of long term incentive awards and dividend equivalent amounts 
received within two years of the date that such awards vested and became exercisable, in the event of a 
material miscalculation of a participant’s entitlement, a material misstatement or restatement of the company’s 
financial results for the years to which the performance periods relate, or material personal misconduct that 
would justify summary dismissal, or result in significant reputational damage to the company, or have a material 
adverse effect on the company’s financial position, or reflect a significant failure of the company’s risk 
management or control.
In the event of a change of control before the expiry of the performance measurement period of a long term 
incentive award, the vesting level of the award will be determined by the Remuneration Committee based on 
the extent to which the Remuneration Committee considers that the performance targets have been achieved 
and vested shares will then be scaled down to reflect the shortened measurement period. The Remuneration 
Committee may modify such vesting levels if it considers that the performance target would be met to a greater 
or lesser degree at the testing date and/or if the application of time pro rating would be inappropriate in the 
circumstances.

Performance 
measurement 
framework
For executive directors who are not directly responsible for a pool of capital, nil-cost options awarded under the 
2011 performance share scheme are subject to the performance of the company’s annualised diluted net asset 
value per share total return (‘NAVTR’) measured over three or five years. For executive directors directly 
responsible for a pool of capital, the nil-cost options are subject to a combination of the performance of the 
company’s annualised NAVTR as above and the annualised total returns achieved by the relevant pool for which 
he or she is responsible, again measured over three or five years. Outstanding nil-cost options awarded in the 
2014 financial year are subject to the performance of NAVTR relative to the FTSE All-Share Total Return index.
Matching share awards previously granted under the deferred bonus plan and which are still in their 
performance measurement period are subject to the performance of the company’s annualised NAVTR, 
measured over three years.
The rules of each scheme provide discretion to the Remuneration Committee to amend the performance 
targets or impose different performance targets and to determine the appropriate proportion of any award 
subject to each performance measure.
The performance targets for all outstanding options granted under the company’s executive share option 
scheme have been met.
Pension related benefits (fixed pay)
Purpose and 
link to strategic 
objectives
To provide a means of retirement saving as part of a range of benefits alongside basic salary to recruit and 
retain high calibre executive directors.
Operation Executive directors are offered defined contribution funding, based on a percentage of salary, to a personal 
pension scheme or a cash salary supplement (or a combination of both) at their choice.
Opportunity 
and recovery or 
withholding 
provisions
The percentage of basic salary for the Chief Executive is 22.5% and for other executive directors 17.5%. If a 
director chooses to take a cash supplement in lieu of some or all of his or her pension entitlement, the payment 
is reduced by such amount as is necessary to make the cash supplement cost neutral for the company after 
taking into account National Insurance contributions.
The Remuneration Committee will retain the discretion to increase the percentage of salary relating to pension 
benefits from time to time in line with market conditions, up to a maximum of 30% of basic salary.
No recovery or withholding provisions.
Performance 
measurement 
framework
Not applicable.
1. Performance measures and targets
 Annual bonus
  For the Chief Executive and the Finance Director, a maximum of 50% of bonus is 
determined by reference to company performance and 50% by reference to 
individual performance objectives. For executive directors responsible for a 
specific pool of capital, 25% of bonus is determined by reference to the 
company’s performance, 25% to pool performance, 35% to pool objectives and 
15% to individual performance objectives. In all cases, the company performance 
element is determined by reference to the relative performance of the company’s 
NAVTR against RPI, with RPI taken as the higher of actual RPI over the bonus year 
or 3%, being broadly in line with its historic long term average. Bonus payments 
for this element commence with a 10% pay-out if NAVTR matches RPI, increasing 
incrementally to the maximum entitlement payable if outperformance of 7% or 
more is achieved. Pool performance is judged by the Remuneration Committee 
by reference to the return achieved by the pool against a set target return and by 
objectives such as deal flow and delivery of portfolio strategy. Individual 
performance is assessed by reference to personal objectives set at the start of 
the year, including non-financial measures such as risk management, marketing of 
the company, team leadership, management skills and promotion of Caledonia’s 
corporate culture and image both internally and externally.
  The Remuneration Committee retains discretion to amend or adopt alternative 
annual bonus targets in order to achieve better alignment with the company’s 
strategic objectives.
 Compulsory deferral of bonus
  Shares comprised in a compulsory deferral will normally only vest if the director 
remains an employee of the Caledonia group for a three year period commencing 
on the first day of the financial year in which the award is made.
 Long term incentive plans
 Performance share scheme
  Outstanding nil-cost options granted prior to the 2014 financial year have all met  
their performance targets.
  For nil-cost options granted in the 2014 financial year, one-half of the shares 
comprised in an award were subject to a performance condition which compared 
the performance of Caledonia’s NAVTR against the FTSE Actuaries UK 
Index-linked Gilts (all stocks) Total Return index (‘Gilts index’) over three years. 
For the other half, NAVTR is measured against the FTSE All-Share Total Return 
index (‘FTSE index’), over five years. Awards vest on a graduated basis, with 10% 
vesting on 0.5% outperformance of the relevant benchmark, rising on a straight 
line basis to maximum vesting on 3.5% outperformance. There is no re-testing of 
either performance target and, to the extent a performance target is not met, the 
relevant award lapses. For the purpose of calculating the performance measures, 
averages of the company’s NAVTR and the two benchmark indices over the three 
months prior to the start and end of the performance period are used to reduce 
volatility. To the extent that the performance targets are met, awards may be 
exercised between the date of vesting and the tenth anniversary of the date of 
grant. Those nil-cost options measured against the Gilts index were tested by 
reference to Caledonia’s NAVTR performance for the three years to 31 March 
2016 and achieved maximum vesting.

51 Annual report 2017 Caledonia Investments plc  
  For nil-cost options granted to Mr Wyatt and Mr King in the 2015 financial year 
and subsequently, awards will vest on a graduated basis, with vesting 
commencing at 10% on the achievement of an annualised NAVTR of 3%, rising 
incrementally to 100% vesting on achievement of an annualised NAVTR of 10%, 
measured over three and five years. For Mr Cayzer-Colvin, who is head of the 
Funds pool, 60% of his performance share scheme awards will be measured 
against the annualised total returns achieved by the Funds pool, measured over 
three and five years. Awards will similarly vest on a graduated basis, with vesting 
commencing at 10% on achievement of an annualised Funds pool total return of 
6%, rising incrementally to 100% vesting on achievement of an annualised total 
return of 13.5%. The remaining 40% of Mr Cayzer-Colvin’s performance share 
scheme awards will be measured against Caledonia’s annualised NAVTR as above.
  For nil-cost options granted in the 2015 financial year, one-half of the shares 
comprised in the awards will be measured over three years and the other half 
over five years. For the 2016 and subsequent financial years, one-third will be 
measured over three years and two-thirds over five years. In all cases, shares 
that vest will become immediately exercisable and will lapse if not exercised 
within ten years of grant. The nil-cost options granted in the 2015 financial year 
which were measured over three years were tested by reference to Caledonia’s 
annualised NAVTR and, in the case of Mr Cayzer-Colvin, also the Funds pool’s 
annualised total return, to 31 March 2017, achieved maximum vesting.
 Deferred bonus plan matching awards
  Matching awards granted prior to the 2016 financial year have all been 
performance tested. Matching awards granted in the 2016 financial year are 
subject to performance measurement by reference to Caledonia’s annualised 
NAVTR over three years, with vesting commencing at 20% on achievement of an 
annualised NAVTR of 4%, rising incrementally to 100% vesting on achievement of 
an annualised NAVTR of 10%. Shares that vest can be called immediately 
following the end of the performance measurement period and will lapse if not 
called within twelve months thereafter.
  Rationale for choice of performance measures for the short and long term 
incentive plans
  The Remuneration Committee has chosen NAVTR as the basis of performance 
measurement for the company for both its short term and long term incentive 
arrangements as it regards this as the best indicator of the success or failure of 
management decisions in terms of creating value for the company.
  For the company performance element of the annual bonus scheme, the board 
has taken the view that benchmarking against a stock market index or indices 
over a short period is not relevant given Caledonia’s long term investment 
horizon and the nature of its portfolio. The Remuneration Committee has 
therefore instead chosen RPI, subject to a minimum of 3%, as the comparator, 
as on this basis executives will only be rewarded to the extent that they are able 
to deliver positive real returns for shareholders. The Remuneration Committee 
will review the rate of increase in RPI at the start of each financial year and may 
adjust the level of outperformance required for the incremental and maximum 
bonus payments in order to ensure that they remain a fair measure of 
performance.
  For awards under the performance share scheme and relevant matching shares 
under the deferred bonus plan, the Remuneration Committee has chosen 
Caledonia’s annualised NAVTR as the performance measurement, as it believes 
that this is the most effective method of aligning directors’ rewards with the long 
term strategic objective of the company of delivering annualised returns over 
rolling ten year periods of between RPI+3% and RPI+6%. For Mr Cayzer-Colvin, 
the Remuneration Committee believes that a significant proportion of his 
variable pay should be weighted towards the annualised total return 
performance of the Funds pool of capital for which he is responsible and has 
therefore determined that 60% of his performance share scheme awards should 
be tested by reference to this.
  The targets for each component of the long term incentive plans have been set 
by the Remuneration Committee with the aim of delivering increasing reward for 
greater outperformance. The Remuneration Committee keeps these measures 
and the levels at which incremental and maximum entitlements are earned under 
review in order to ensure that they remain sufficiently challenging and aligned 
with the company’s strategy and key performance indicators.
2. New components introduced into the new remuneration policy
  There are no new components included in the above policy table which were 
not a part of the remuneration policy previously operated for executive directors 
by the company.
3. Changes to components included in the previous remuneration policy
  The only changes to the previous remuneration policy are the removal of 
the availability of voluntary bonus deferral and the award of deferred bonus 
matching shares, an increase in the standard annual award under the performance 
share scheme from 125% of basic salary to 150% to compensate for the removal 
of deferred bonus matching and the introduction of clawback provisions for all 
elements of variable pay.
4.  How the remuneration policy for executive directors relates to remuneration 
of Caledonia group employees generally
  Caledonia’s executive directors’ remuneration packages tend to be higher than 
those of other group employees, but also include a higher proportion of variable pay.

Chairman and non-executive directors
The table below sets out each component of the Chairman’s and the non-executive directors’ remuneration and the approach 
taken by the company in relation thereto. 
Component Approach
Chairman’s and 
non-executive 
directors’ fees
The Chairman’s fee is determined by the Remuneration Committee and the non-executive directors’ fees 
are set by the board. These are reviewed periodically taking into account the responsibilities and time 
commitments required and non-executive director fee levels generally.
The Chairman receives an annual fee, which includes his basic non-executive director’s fee, but does not 
receive any other remuneration.
Non-executive directors receive basic fees, which are subject to an aggregate annual limit for non-executive 
directors’ ordinary remuneration contained in the articles of association, currently £350,000. In addition, 
special fees are paid for the chairmanship and membership of the Audit and Remuneration Committees 
and also for the role of Senior Independent Non-Executive Director and chairman of the Governance 
Committee. 
The fees of the Chairman and the non-executive directors on implementation of the policy will be as 
follows:
Chairman £150,000 Basic non-executive director’s fee £39,900
Audit Committee chairman £5,600 Audit Committee member £2,300
Remuneration Committee chairman £4,900 Remuneration Committee member £1,600
Senior Independent Director/ 
Governance Committee chairman £5,100 
Additional fees 
payable for 
services to other 
group companies
Exceptionally, non-executive directors may receive fees from subsidiary companies for services provided to 
them. Fees for services provided to subsidiary companies are set and reviewed by the boards of those 
companies, but will not exceed £100,000 per annum in aggregate for any non-executive director.
Other benefits The Chairman and the non-executive directors are all covered under the company’s directors’ and officers’ 
liability insurance policy and have the benefit of an indemnity under the company’s articles of association. 
The Chairman is also provided with an office and secretarial support.
The company may, where appropriate, pay for the cost of spouses or partners accompanying non-executive 
directors on trips where there is a business reason for doing so and reimburse non-executive directors for 
hotel accommodation and travel expenses (in each case including payment of any tax thereon).
Remuneration policy for new appointments
Executive directors
In the case of the appointment of a new executive director, 
the Remuneration Committee would typically seek to align 
the remuneration package with the above remuneration policy. 
The Remuneration Committee however retains the discretion 
to make special remuneration commitments on the 
appointment of a new executive director, including the use of 
awards made under Rule 9.4.2 of the Listing Rules, if such were 
necessary to ensure the recruitment of a candidate. In doing so, 
the Remuneration Committee would take into consideration all 
relevant factors, including, but not limited to, overall quantum, 
type of remuneration offered and comparability with the 
packages of other Caledonia senior executives and the total 
variable pay would not exceed the maxima stated in the policy 
table for executive director remuneration above.
The Remuneration Committee may in addition make bonus 
commitments or share awards on the appointment of an 
external candidate to compensate for remuneration 
arrangements forfeited on leaving a previous employer, 
taking into account factors such as any performance conditions 
attached to these awards, the form in which they were granted, 
for example cash or shares, and the time over which they would 
have vested. The aim would be to ensure that replacement 
awards would be made on no greater than a comparable basis.
In order to attract and retain suitable executives, the 
Remuneration Committee retains discretion, in exceptional 
circumstances, to offer service contracts with up to an initial 
24 month notice period, which then reduces to 12 months at 
the end of this initial period. If it considers it appropriate, the 
Remuneration Committee may also offer a lower salary initially, 
but with a series of increases to achieve the desired salary 
positioning over a period of time, as the individual develops 
into the role.

If a new appointment is the result of an internal promotion, 
the Remuneration Committee would expect to honour any 
pre-existing contractual arrangements or benefits package 
agreed with the relevant individual. In the event that a new 
director resides overseas, the Remuneration Committee may 
agree a reasonable relocation package and tax equalisation 
arrangements.
In recruiting any new executive director, the Remuneration 
Committee would apply the overall policy objective that 
executive directors’ remuneration should be competitive, but 
not excessive. In the event that the Remuneration Committee 
agreed that it was necessary for special commitments or 
sign-on arrangements to be offered to secure the recruitment 
of a new executive director, an explanation of why these were 
required and details thereof would be announced at the time 
of appointment.
Chairman and non-executive directors
Terms for the appointment of any new Chairman or non-
executive director would also be determined by the 
Remuneration Committee or the board within the above 
remuneration policy.
Executive directors’ service contracts and the 
Chairman’s and non-executive directors’ letters 
of appointment 
Executive directors
Executive directors have service contracts with Caledonia 
Group Services Ltd, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the company, 
details of which are summarised below:
Date of contract
Notice period
for company
and director
Unexpired  
term
W P Wyatt 2 Jun 2005 12 months 12 months
S A King 19 Nov 2009 12 months 12 months
J M B Cayzer-Colvin 19 Apr 2005 12 months 12 months
If notice is served by either party, the director can continue to 
receive basic salary, benefits and pension payments for the 
duration of the notice period, during which time the company 
may require the individual to continue to fulfil his current duties 
or may assign a period of gardening leave. Alternatively, the 
company may, in its discretion, terminate the contract without 
notice and make a lump sum payment in lieu of notice. This lump 
sum would include an amount equivalent to the basic salary and 
benefits (based on a fixed percentage of salary specified in the 
service contract) for the unexpired period of notice to which the 
payment relates. Mr Wyatt’s and Mr Cayzer-Colvin’s service 
contracts provide that an amount equivalent to 80% of the 
average of the annual bonuses paid for the previous three 
financial years would also be included in the payment in lieu of 
notice. Mr Wyatt’s and Mr Cayzer-Colvin’s service contracts also 
include provisions whereby a liquidated sum is payable in the 
event of termination within one year following a change of 
control. The payment would be calculated on the same basis as 
a payment in lieu of notice, except that an amount equivalent to 
100% of the average of the annual bonuses paid for the previous 
three financial years would be included.
Mr King’s service contract contains provisions whereby, as 
an alternative to the payment of a lump sum in lieu of notice, 
the company may elect to pay the equivalent amount in equal 
monthly instalments, such instalments to be reduced by 50% of 
one-twelfth of the basic salary in excess of £20,000 per annum 
that Mr King receives from any alternative employment that he 
takes up during the notice period.
Executive directors’ service contracts may be terminated 
without notice and without any further payment (other than 
in respect of amounts due at the date of termination) on the 
occurrence of certain events such as gross misconduct.
Chairman and non-executive directors
The Chairman and the non-executive directors do not 
have service contracts, but are appointed under letters of 
appointment, which provide for termination without notice 
or compensation.
Inspection
Executive directors’ service contracts and the Chairman’s and 
non-executive directors’ letters of appointment are available 
for inspection at the registered office of the company.
Policy on external non-executive directorships held 
by executive directors
It is the company’s policy to allow executive directors to hold 
non-executive directorships unrelated to the company’s 
business to broaden their commercial experience, provided 
that the time required is not material. Normally the company 
will retain any fees arising from such non-executive directorships, 
but may permit the executive director to retain fees on a case 
by case basis.
Details of any fees from external non-executive directorships 
retained by executive directors are disclosed in the Annual 
report on directors’ remuneration.

Illustration of the application of the remuneration policy for executive directors
The charts below provide an indication of the total pay of the executive directors in the first year of operation of the remuneration 
policy under three assumed performance scenarios:
• 	 minimum receivable – this assumes that the director receives fixed components of pay only and nothing in respect of annual 
bonus or long term incentives
• 	 receivable for target performance – this assumes that, in addition to fixed pay, there is a pay-out of 50% of basic salary for 
annual bonus and 50% vesting for performance share scheme awards
• 	 maximum receivable – this assumes that, in addition to fixed pay, there is a maximum bonus of 100% basic salary and 100% 
vesting of performance share scheme awards. 
1.  Fixed pay – comprises basic salary and pension related benefits, based on basic salary for the financial year ending 31 March 2018 and other taxable benefits taken from 
the table of total emoluments paid to directors for the 2017 financial year included in the Annual report on directors’ remuneration.
2.  Annual bonus – based on basic salary for the year ending 31 March 2018.
3.  Long term awards – for target performance and maximum receivable, an initial grant of 150% of basic salary for the year ending 31 March 2018 under the performance 
share scheme is assumed, as this is the policy maximum set by the Remuneration Committee, notwithstanding that the maximum permitted under the scheme rules is 
200%. No share price growth is assumed for shares vesting under the performance share scheme, nor are any dividend equivalents that might accrue on share awards 
included.
Policy on payments for loss of office
Executive directors
It is the policy of the company that, other than in exceptional 
circumstances on recruitment as stated above, no executive 
director should be offered a service contract that requires 
more than one year’s notice of termination or which contains 
provision for predetermined compensation in excess of one 
year’s total emoluments. In the event of a termination, the 
Remuneration Committee will consider a director’s past 
performance and the circumstances of the departure in 
exercising any discretions relating to the arrangements for 
loss of office, including contractual obligations, prevailing 
best practice, the reason for the departure and any transition 
or handover required.
The termination provisions in executive directors’ current 
service contracts are described above in the section on 
executive directors’ service contracts. It is the Remuneration 
Committee’s intention that all future executive directors’ 
service contracts should include provisions enabling the 
company to reduce compensation payments in the event that 
the director takes up alternative employment within the notice 
period. However, if a new director is appointed internally, the 
Remuneration Committee would expect to honour any existing 
contractual arrangements agreed with the relevant individual 
before he or she becomes a director.
In applying the company’s right to make a lump sum payment 
in lieu of notice, the Remuneration Committee would normally 
expect to pro rate the lump sum for the unexpired period of 
notice to which the payment relates. In appropriate 
circumstances, the Remuneration Committee may make a 
payment in respect of the full twelve months’ notice period, 
even if the director works under notice for part of it.

55 Annual report 2017 Caledonia Investments plc  
The company’s annual bonus scheme provides that an 
employee must be in the group’s employment and not under 
notice of termination (either given or received) in order to be 
entitled to receive a bonus for the relevant financial year. The 
Remuneration Committee would expect to apply this principle 
to executive director terminations, but retains discretion to 
make bonus payments on termination if it believes it 
appropriate to do so. 
Executive directors would also be entitled under their service 
contracts to be paid on termination for any accrued, but 
untaken, holiday entitlement. The Remuneration Committee 
may, where it considers it appropriate in the circumstances, 
make payments for loss of statutory rights or waiver thereof 
and a contribution towards legal and outplacement fees. The 
Remuneration Committee may also make a payment to ensure 
that any restrictive covenants remain enforceable.
Where the director holds unvested awards under the 
company’s long term incentive schemes, the Remuneration 
Committee would exercise its discretions as to vesting in 
accordance with the relevant scheme rules. In good leaver 
circumstances, for example where cessation of employment 
is by reason of death, retirement, injury, disability, ill-health, 
redundancy, or such other reason as the Remuneration 
Committee may decide, the Remuneration Committee will 
normally determine the level of vesting based on the 
attainment of the performance targets, either at the time of 
cessation or at the normal test date if permitted by the scheme 
rules, but in the case of the former may decrease or increase 
the level of vesting if the Remuneration Committee considers 
that the targets would have been met to a lesser or greater 
extent at the end of the performance period. The number 
of shares that vest will normally be reduced to reflect the 
proportion of the performance period that the director was 
in employment, although the Remuneration Committee has 
discretion not to scale down the number of shares if it believes 
it appropriate in the circumstances.
Following termination, the Remuneration Committee 
may agree to pay a director consultancy fees and continue 
insurance related benefits until the end of the insurance 
policy period. The company’s directors’ and officers’ liability 
insurance policy also provides for a six year period of run-off 
cover for former directors. In limited circumstances, the 
company may permit a director to remain in employment after 
ceasing to be a director for a limited period to allow time for 
an effective handover or for a successor to be appointed.
Chairman and non-executive directors
The Chairman and the non-executive directors have no 
entitlement to any compensation on termination of their 
appointments, although they would have the benefit of run-off 
cover under the directors’ and officers’ liability insurance policy 
as described above.
Statement of consideration of employment 
conditions elsewhere in the group
In setting the policy for directors’ remuneration, the 
Remuneration Committee considered pay and employment 
conditions of other employees within the group. The 
Remuneration Committee does not however seek to apply any 
metrics between pay levels of different roles within the group as 
this would restrict flexibility in aligning reward and performance 
and potentially could hinder the recruitment and retention of 
high calibre individuals. Executive directors’ remuneration 
packages are however benchmarked with other senior 
investment executives, who participate in the same annual 
bonus and long term incentive plans. Given the parity of these 
remuneration arrangements, the Remuneration Committee did 
not feel it necessary to conduct any formal consultation with 
employees, although views expressed by senior executives were 
shared with Remuneration Committee members. 
Statement of consideration of shareholder views
Prior to the finalisation of this policy, the Remuneration 
Committee consulted a number of the company’s larger 
shareholders and certain institutional shareholder 
representative bodies through written correspondence and 
a telephone conference call. No changes to the remuneration 
policy were requested as a result of the consultation.
More generally, the Remuneration Committee receives copies 
of any correspondence from shareholders relating to 
remuneration matters and the company’s annual general 
meeting provides shareholders with the opportunity to ask 
questions about directors’ remuneration.

1. Taxable benefits
  Taxable benefits comprised private medical insurance cover and a small 
Christmas supplement paid to all Caledonia staff. Mr Wyatt’s and Mr Cayzer-
Colvin’s taxable benefits also included a cash allowance of £15,024 in lieu of 
a company car.
  In addition to taxable benefits, other non-taxable benefits were provided 
to executive directors, including death-in-service insurance (4x basic salary), 
permanent health insurance, directors’ and officers’ liability insurance and 
certain other benefits of minor value provided to all of Caledonia’s staff.
2. Short term incentives
  In accordance with the rules of the company’s deferred bonus plan, the following 
amounts included in the total of short term incentives were compulsorily deferred, 
to be satisfied by share awards made shortly after the approval of the new 
remuneration policy:

S A King 183 184 367 – 164 164 
J M B Cayzer-Colvin 155 155 310 – 148 148 
  For Mr Wyatt and Mr King, a maximum of 50% of bonus was determined 
by reference to company performance and 50% by reference to individual 
performance objectives. For Mr Cayzer-Colvin, who has specific responsibility 
for the Funds pool of capital, 25% of his bonus was determined by reference to 
the company’s performance, 25% to his pool’s performance, 35% to his pool’s 
objectives and 15% to individual performance objectives. For the 2017 financial 
year, the company performance element was determined by reference to the 
relative performance of the company’s NAV per share total return (‘NAVTR’) 
against the Retail Prices Index (‘RPI’), which for bonus purposes was taken as 3%, 
or actual RPI if greater, with bonus payments for this element commencing with a 
10% pay-out if the company’s NAVTR matched RPI, increasing incrementally to 
the maximum entitlement payable if outperformance of 7% or more was 
achieved. Mr Cayzer-Colvin’s pool performance was assessed by reference to the 
return achieved by the Funds pool over the year, with payments commencing on 
achievement of a total return of 6%, rising to a maximum pay-out against a total 
return of 13.5%, and pool objectives, by measures such as increasing Caledonia’s 
knowledge of the Asian and US fund universe, raising the company’s profile with 
target fund managers and further development of portfolio strategy. Individual 
performance for each executive director was assessed by reference to personal 
objectives set at the start of the year, including non-financial measures such as 
risk management, marketing of the company, team leadership, management skills 
and promotion of Caledonia’s corporate culture and image both internally and 
externally.
  The company’s NAVTR was 18.0% over the year, therefore achieving a maximum 
pay-out. The Funds pool’s return over the year was 23.1%, well above the 
maximum payment trigger of 13.5% and therefore a maximum bonus was 
awarded to Mr Cayzer-Colvin for this element. In view of the significant progress 
made by the Funds pool in developing the private equity fund strategy and 
deploying capital with chosen managers in both Asia and the US, the 
Remuneration Committee awarded Mr Cayzer-Colvin the maximum of 35% for 
attainment of his pool objectives. Based on an assessment of their individual 
performance objectives over the year, the Remuneration Committee awarded Mr 
Cayzer-Colvin his maximum bonus for that component of 15% and Mr Wyatt and 
Mr King also their maximum of 50%.
  The total bonuses awarded to Mr Wyatt, Mr King and Mr Cayzer-Colvin for the 
year were therefore determined as follows:

3. Long term incentives
  The long term incentive awards whose performance measurement period ended 
during the year were all of the matching share awards granted in 2014 under the 
company’s deferred bonus plan and half of the awards granted in that year under 
the performance share scheme. The vesting of the awards under the deferred 
bonus plan was dependent on the performance of the company’s NAVTR over 
the three financial years ended 31 March 2017 measured against two separate 
performance benchmarks. For two-thirds of the shares comprised in an award, 
Caledonia’s NAVTR was measured against the FTSE All-Share Total Return index 
(‘FTSE index’) and for the remaining one-third against the FTSE Actuaries UK 
Index-linked Gilts (all stocks) Total Return index (‘Gilts index’). In each case, 
vesting was on a graduated basis, with 10% vesting on achievement of 0.5% 
outperformance of the relevant benchmark index, rising on a straight line basis to 
100% vesting on 3.5% outperformance of the relevant index. For the purpose of 
calculating the performance measures, averages of the figures for the company’s 
NAVTR and the two benchmark indices published over the three months prior 
to the start and end of the performance period were used to reduce volatility.

57 Annual report 2017 Caledonia Investments plc  
  Under the performance share scheme, for Mr Wyatt and Mr King half of the 
shares comprised in the awards granted in 2014 were to be measured by 
reference to Caledonia’s annualised NAVTR performance over three years and 
half on the same basis over five years. In each case, vesting would be on a 
graduated basis, commencing at 10% on achievement of an annualised NAVTR 
of 3%, rising incrementally to 100% vesting on an annualised NAVTR of 10%. For 
Mr Cayzer-Colvin, 40% of his 2014 performance share scheme awards were to be 
measured against Caledonia’s annualised NAVTR as above, and 60% by reference 
to the annualised total return achieved by the Funds pool, with graduated vesting 
commencing at 10% on achievement of an annualised total return of 6% rising 
incrementally to 100% vesting on achievement of an annualised total return of 
13.5%. Again, half of his 2014 award was to be measured over three years and 
half over five years.
  For the 2014 deferred bonus matching share awards, the company’s NAVTR 
increased by 41.5% over the three year performance period, compared with 
increases of 22.5% for the FTSE index and 43.2% for the Gilts index. Accordingly, the 
two-thirds of the 2014 deferred bonus scheme matching share awards measured by 
reference to the FTSE index vested in full, whereas none of the one-third measured 
by reference to the Gilts index vested and therefore lapsed in their entirety. 
  For the half of the 2014 performance share scheme awards measured over the 
three years to 31 March 2017, Caledonia’s annualised NAVTR over the period was 
11.4%, resulting in maximum vesting. For Mr Cayzer-Colvin’s awards measured by 
reference to his pool’s performance, the Funds pool delivered an annualised total 
return of 23.7% over the period, also therefore resulting in maximum vesting. 
  The amounts shown in the table above under long term incentives therefore 
comprised the value of the vested deferred bonus plan matching awards and 
the vested performance share scheme awards granted in 2014, based on the 
company’s share price at 31 March 2017 of 2750p, together with the value of 
dividends and any associated tax credits that would have accrued on the vested 
shares during the relevant retention periods and also the value of dividend 
equivalents that would have accrued on the compulsory deferred bonus plan 
awards granted in 2014, that gave rise to the matching share awards. These are 
analysed as follows:

Defined benefit
The Hon C W Cayzer is provided with benefits in the Caledonia 
Pension Scheme, a final salary defined benefit pension scheme. 
He ceased to be an active member of the scheme in December 
2012 and therefore has not accrued any further benefits in 
addition to those already accrued since then, nor have any 
contributions been made on his behalf into the scheme. The 
increase in pension accrued over the year was due to a further 
year of deferral revaluation. The Hon C W Cayzer reached 
normal retirement age of 60 on 26 April 2017, at which point 
he began drawing his pension benefits.

1.  The accrued pensions shown in rows (a) and (b) represented the deferred pension 
that would be paid at normal retirement age, before any potential taxation and 
ignoring any revaluation from the date shown to normal retirement age.
2.  The transfer values shown in rows (d) and (e) were the present values of the 
accrued pension revalued to normal retirement age and associated benefits at 
the relevant date. Transfer values were calculated using the transfer value basis 
as determi ned by the trustees of the Caledonia Pension Scheme, which reflected 
market conditions at the relevant date.
3.  The change in transfer value over the year shown in row (f) (calculated as row (d) 
less row (e)), also reflected the impact on transfer values of factors beyond the 
control of the company and the directors, such as movements in financial 
markets. These changes can cause transfer values at different points in time to 
fluctuate significantly. Disclosed changes in transfer values may therefore be 
subject to a large degree of volatility and may even be negative. In particular, the 
Caledonia Pension Scheme’s transfer value assumptions have been updated to 
allow for changes in market conditions.
4.  The Hon C W Cayzer began drawing his pension on 26 April 2017.

Statement of directors’ shareholdings and scheme 
interests (audited)
Executive directors’ minimum shareholding guidelines
In order to align the interests of executive directors with those 
of shareholders, the Remuneration Committee has adopted 
guidelines for minimum shareholdings, which executive directors 
will be expected to attain through the retention of all post-tax 
share awards vesting under the company’s long term incentive 
plans until the minimum shareholding is met. For these purposes, 
shareholdings include those of connected persons and also the 
value, net of any exercise costs, income tax and National 
Insurance contributions, of unexercised options granted under 
the company’s executive share option scheme and awards 
granted under its performance share scheme for which the 
performance targets have been met. Also included are bonuses 
deferred, compulsorily or voluntarily, under the company’s 
deferred bonus plan and any uncalled bonus matching shares 
for which the performance targets have been met, again net 
of income tax and National Insurance contributions.

1. Performance conditions
 Performance share scheme
  Nil-cost options awarded under the performance share scheme on 28 May 2012 
have met their performance targets.
  Half of the nil-cost options granted on 12 June 2013 have met their performance 
targets. The other half are subject to a target related to the company’s NAVTR 
performance against the FTSE index measured over five years. Awards vest on a 
graduated basis, with 10% vesting on 0.5% outperformance of the benchmark, 
rising to maximum vesting on 3.5% outperformance. There is no re-testing of the 
performance target and, to the extent that it is not met, the award will lapse. For 
the purpose of calculating the performance measure, averages of the company’s 
NAVTR and the FTSE index over the three months prior to the start and end of 
the performance period is used to reduce volatility. To the extent that the 
performance target is met, vested awards may be exercised between the date 
of vesting and the tenth anniversary of the date of grant.
  For nil-cost options granted to Mr Wyatt and Mr King on 27 November 2014, 
26 June 2015 and 26 May 2016, shares will vest on a graduated basis, with vesting 
commencing at 10% if the company achieves an annualised NAVTR of 3%, rising 
incrementally to 100% vesting on achievement of an annualised NAVTR of 10%. 
For Mr Cayzer-Colvin, who is head of the Funds pool, 60% of his performance 
share scheme awards granted on 27 November 2014, 26 June 2015 and 26 May 
2016 will be measured against the annualised total returns achieved by the Funds 
pool. Awards will similarly vest on a graduated basis, with vesting commencing at 
10% on achievement of an annualised Funds pool total return of 6%, rising 
incrementally to 100% vesting on achievement of an annualised total return of 
13.5%. The remaining 40% of Mr Cayzer-Colvin’s performance share scheme 
awards for these grants will be measured against Caledonia’s NAVTR as above. 
For the nil-cost options granted on 27 November 2014, the relevant performance 
conditions will be tested over three years for one-half of the shares comprised in 
an award and over five years for the other half of the shares comprised in an 
award. For the nil-cost options granted on 26 June 2015 and 26 May 2016, the 
relevant performance conditions will be tested over three years for one-third of 
the shares comprised in an award and over five years for the remaining two-thirds 
of the shares comprised in an award.
  The one-half of the shares comprised in the nil-cost options granted on 
27 November 2014 were performance tested against their relevant targets 
as at 31 March 2017 and all achieved maximum vesting.
 Deferred bonus plan matching awards
  For the matching awards granted on 6 June 2014, two-thirds of the shares 
comprised in the awards were tested against the FTSE index and one-third against 
the Gilts index, each over three years and on the graduated scale and basis of 
measurement described for the performance share scheme awards granted on 
12 June 2013. The two-thirds of the awards tested against the FTSE index vested 
in full, whereas the one-third tested against the Gilts index failed to meet the 
minimum vesting threshold and therefore lapsed in their entirety. For the 
matching awards granted on 26 June 2015, shares will vest on a graduated basis, 
with vesting commencing at 20% if the company achieves an annualised NAVTR 
measured over three years of 4%, rising incrementally to 100% vesting on 
achievement of an annualised NAVTR of 10%. Shares that vest must be called 
within 12 months of vesting.
2. Other exercise conditions
 Performance share scheme
  For the nil-cost options granted under the performance share scheme on 
28 May 2012, the performance targets have been met, although the shares 
are normally only exercisable five years after grant. For nil-cost options granted 
thereafter, shares that vest following the three or five year performance testing 
become immediately exercisable.
3. Vested but unexercised
  Shares vested but unexercised represent those awards that are immediately 
exercisable without any conditions.
Performance graph of total shareholder return and 
table of Chief Executive’s total remuneration
The graph below shows the company’s total shareholder return 
(‘TSR’) against that of the FTSE All-Share Total Return index for 
the eight financial years ending on 31 March 2017. TSR has 
been calculated assuming that all dividends are reinvested on 
their ex-dividend dates. The FTSE All-Share Total Return index 
has been chosen as it is the benchmark by which the company 
measures its delivery of value over the longer term.

1.  Mr Ingram served as Chief Executive until his retirement on 21 July 2010, at which 
time Mr Wyatt was appointed as his successor. The remuneration shown for 2011 
represents the amounts paid to each in the period that they served as Chief 
Executive in that financial year. The long term incentives held by Mr Ingram which 
vested in 2011 were HMRC approved executive share options granted in 2008, 
which the Remuneration Committee determined should vest based on the 
measurement of the performance targets up to the date of his retirement. 
The percentage of short term incentives shown as vesting for Mr Wyatt in 2011 
related to his annual bonus for that year, the total amount of which has been 
included in the corresponding single figure for total remuneration.
  Subsequent to his retirement, Mr Ingram exercised further share options 
at a pre-tax gain of £119,413 in the 2014 financial year.

Percentage change in remuneration of Chief Executive
The following table shows the percentage change in the basic 
salary, value of taxable benefits and short term incentives paid 
to the Chief Executive in the year to 31 March 2017 against the 
previous financial year, compared with the average percentage 
changes in those components of pay of Caledonia’s other staff 
on a per capita basis. The Chief Executive did not receive an 
increase in basic salary for the 2017 financial year, whereas 
Caledonia’s staff received a standard increase in basic salary of 
1.0%. The per capital percentage increase for staff shown in the 
table is however higher due to the effect of non-standard 
increases awarded for promotions, increased responsibilities or 
other such adjustments. The average per capita percentage 
change for staff taxable benefits increased over the year 
principally due to age related premium re-rating under the 
company’s private medical insurance plan. The Chief Executive 
was awarded a bonus of 100% of basic salary, based on the 
company’s performance and individual objectives, compared 
with 45% in the previous year. Caledonia’s staff were also 
awarded maximum bonuses, however their average per capital 
percentage change was lower due to a variety of factors, such 
as differing bonus scales and the fact that some members of 
staff received a higher percentage bonus than the Chief 
Executive in 2016.

Chairman’s and non-executive directors’ fees
The Chairman’s and the non-executive directors’ fees are 
reviewed triennially. The last review was in April 2017 and 
it was concluded that the Chairman’s fee should be reduced 
from £184,500 pa to £150,000 pa with effect from the 
implementation of the revised remuneration policy on 
20 July 2017, but that the fees for the other non-executive 
directors should remain unchanged, as follows:

Annual bonus scheme and long term incentive schemes
As outlined in the Chairman of the Remuneration Committee’s 
annual statement, it is proposed to discontinue the award 
of matching shares for deferred bonus and, in compensation, 
to increase the policy level of annual awards under the 
performance share scheme from 125% to 150% of basic salary. 
No other changes to the company’s annual bonus or long term 
incentive schemes are anticipated for the 2018 financial year.
Approach
The Remuneration Committee will keep the implementation of 
the remuneration policy under review in order to take account 
of any changes in the company’s business environment and 
remuneration practice generally, but with the overall aim of 
ensuring that Caledonia’s remuneration arrangements continue 
to support the company’s strategy and deliver long term 
shareholder value by attracting and retaining talent and 
rewarding executives appropriately in the light of the 
company’s performance.
Consideration by the directors of matters relating 
to directors’ remuneration
The current members of the Remuneration Committee are 
Charles Gregson (Chairman), David Stewart and Shonaid 
Jemmett-Page, all of whom served throughout the year. 
During the year, the Remuneration Committee received advice 
from Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer LLP , the company’s main 
legal advisers, in relation to the preparation of the 2016 Directors’ 
remuneration report, legal issues relating to the post-grant 
amendment of the performance measures for the 2014 deferred 
bonus plan matching awards, and the 2017 remuneration policy 
renewal. The Remuneration Committee also consulted with the 
Chairman and the Chief Executive in relation to the remuneration 
of the executive directors and internal support was provided 
to the Remuneration Committee by the Company Secretary.
Statement of voting at general meetings
At the annual general meeting of the company held on 21 July 
2016, the proxy votes lodged for the resolution relating to 
directors’ remuneration were as follows:

64 Annual report 2017 Caledonia Investments plc  
Dividend policy
The company’s policy is to pay an increasing annual dividend per 
share in real terms, which it has now done for 50 consecutive 
years. In addition, the company may supplement the annual 
dividend with special dividends when the board considers it 
appropriate, for example if the company has surplus cash 
reserves in excess of its strategic investment plans. 
The board’s objective is to ensure that the annual dividend 
is fully covered by investment income for the financial year, 
although the company has available distributable reserves of 
£1,895m, broadly equivalent to over 60 years payment of the 
current annual dividend, which could be used to smooth any 
investment income shortfall. 
2017 dividend distributions
An interim dividend of 14.9p per share (2016 – 14.3p) was paid 
on 5 January 2017 and the board has recommended a final 
dividend of 39.9p per share (2016 – second interim dividend of 
38.3p per share), giving total annual dividends for the year of 
54.8p per share (2016 – 52.6p).
In addition, the directors have recommended a special dividend 
of 100.0p per share (2016 – nil).
Share capital structure
The company has two classes of share capital – ordinary shares 
of 5p each and deferred ordinary shares of 5p each.
The holders of the ordinary shares are entitled to receive 
dividends as declared from time to time and are entitled to one 
vote per share at meetings of the company. All voting rights are 
however suspended in respect of any of the company’s shares 
that are held in treasury or by group companies.
The deferred ordinary shares carry no voting rights and are 
not redeemable. They carry the right to a fixed cumulative 
preference dividend of 1% per annum (exclusive of any 
associated tax credit) of the nominal value of such deferred 
ordinary shares, being 0.05p per share, or £4,000 in aggregate, 
for all such shares currently in issue. The company is required 
to pay the dividend to the extent that it has distributable 
profits. On a winding-up or other return of capital, the deferred 
ordinary shares carry the right to the payment of the amount 
paid up on such shares only after holders of the ordinary shares 
have received the sum of £100,000 in respect of each ordinary 
share. All of the deferred ordinary shares are held by Sterling 
Industries Ltd, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Caledonia.
At 31 March 2017, 55,381,017 ordinary shares and 8,000,000 
deferred ordinary shares were in issue. The ordinary shares 
therefore represented approximately 87% and the deferred 
ordinary shares approximately 13% of the total issued share 
capital by nominal value. Of the ordinary shares in issue at 
31 March 2017, 3,000 shares were held by a group company. 
As stated above, all voting rights are suspended on these 
shares. The company did not purchase any of its ordinary 
shares during the year and accordingly the company’s issued 
share capital as at 24 May 2017, being the latest practicable 
date prior to signature of these accounts, was 55,381,017 
ordinary shares and 8,000,000 deferred ordinary shares.
Restrictions on the transfer of shares
There are no specific restrictions on the transfer of the company’s 
shares, although the articles of association contain provisions 
whereby the directors may refuse to register a transfer of a 
certificated share which is not fully paid, provided that such 
refusal does not prevent dealings in the share from taking place 
on an open and proper basis. The directors may also refuse to 
register the transfer of a certificated share unless it is (a) lodged, 
duly stamped, at the registered office or at such other place as 
the directors may appoint, accompanied by the certificate for 
the shares to which it relates and such other evidence as the 
directors may reasonably require to show the right of the 
transferor to make the transfer; (b) in respect of only one class 
of shares; and (c) in favour of not more than four transferees.
The directors may refuse to register a transfer of shares if 
a shareholder has not supplied information to the company 
in default of a request duly served under section 793 of 
the Companies Act 2006 and such shares represent at least 
0.25% of the class of shares concerned.

Employee share trust
The Caledonia Investments plc Employee Share Trust acquires 
and holds ordinary shares in the company for subsequent 
transfer to employees exercising options under the company’s 
executive share option scheme and the performance share 
scheme or calling for awards vesting under the company’s 
deferred bonus plan. The voting rights of shares held by the 
trust are exercisable by the independent trustee. The trust is 
financed by an interest free loan facility from Caledonia and 
the trustee has waived all dividends payable in respect of the 
ordinary shares held by the trust, except to the extent of 
0.0001% of such dividends. 
At 31 March 2017, the trust held 487,217 ordinary shares, 
representing 0.88% of the total issued voting share capital. 
Restrictions on voting rights
The directors may direct that a shareholder shall not be entitled 
to attend and vote either personally or by proxy or exercise any 
other right conferred by membership in relation to general 
meetings of the company in respect of some or all of the shares 
held by him, if he or any person with an interest in such shares 
has been duly served with a notice under section 793 of the 
Companies Act 2006 and is in default for the prescribed period 
in supplying to the company the information required or, in 
purported compliance with such a notice, has made a statement 
which is false or inadequate in a material particular.
Agreements which may restrict the transfer of 
shares or exercise of voting rights
The company is not aware of any arrangements which may 
restrict the transfer of any of its shares or the exercise of any 
voting rights.
Authority to allot and purchase shares
At the annual general meeting of the company held on 
21 July 2016, shareholders granted to the directors authority 
to allot ordinary shares up to a nominal amount of £923,016, 
representing approximately one-third of the ordinary share 
capital then in issue, with authority to allot additional ordinary 
shares up to a nominal value of £923,017, representing 
approximately a further one-third of the ordinary share capital 
then in issue, by way of pre-emptive rights issues only, in 
accordance with guidance issued at that time by the 
Association of British Insurers. The directors were further 
authorised to issue ordinary shares up to a nominal amount of 
£138,452 other than pro rata to existing ordinary shareholders. 
These authorities last until 21 October 2017 or, if earlier, the 
conclusion of the next annual general meeting.
At the annual general meeting held on 21 July 2016, shareholders 
also granted authority for the company to make market purchases 
of up to 5,538,100 of its own ordinary shares, being approximately 
10% of the ordinary share capital then in issue, at a price not more 
than the higher of (a) 5% greater than the average of the middle 
market quotations for such ordinary shares during the five 
business days preceding any such purchase; and (b) the higher of 
(i) the price of the last independent trade in such ordinary shares; 
and (ii) the highest current independent bid relating thereto on 
the trading venue where the purchase is carried out, nor at a price 
less than 5p, being the nominal value of an ordinary share. This 
authority lasts until 21 October 2017 or, if earlier, the conclusion of 
the next annual general meeting. At the same time, shareholders 
who were not members of the Cayzer family concert party 
(‘Cayzer Concert Party’) gave their approval for a waiver by the 
Panel on Takeovers and Mergers of the obligation that could 
arise on the Cayzer Concert Party under Rule 9 of the City Code 
on Takeovers and Mergers to make a general offer for Caledonia 
on the implementation by the company of the above authority 
to purchase its own shares. The approval was subject to the 
maximum percentage of voting rights in which the Cayzer Concert 
Party is interested not exceeding 49.9% as a result of purchases by 
the company. This waiver expires on 21 October 2017 or, if earlier, 
the conclusion of the next annual general meeting.
Due to the level of the shareholding of the Cayzer Concert Party 
and the maximum percentage of voting rights permitted to be 
held by it under the Rule 9 waiver, the board has only limited 
scope to utilise the authority to purchase the company’s shares. 
It will however consider using the authority when it considers it 
in the company’s and shareholders’ best interests to do so, for 
example when it believes that the shares represent good value 
in terms of the level of the discount to net asset value, and 
taking into account anticipated future cash requirements. 
Change of control rights
There are no special control rights in relation to the company’s 
shares.
Options granted under the company’s executive share option 
scheme and its performance share scheme and awards made 
under its deferred bonus plan may become exercisable or vest 
as a result of a change of control, although the number of 
shares comprised in those options or awards may be reduced. 
The service contracts of certain directors and other senior 
executives also contain provisions whereby a liquidated sum 
is payable by the company in the event of termination within 
one year following a change of control. 
Further details of these change of control rights are set out 
in the Directors’ remuneration report.

Investment trust status
Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs has confirmed 
that Caledonia has investment trust status for all relevant 
financial periods.
Annual general meeting
The eighty-eighth annual general meeting of the company will 
be held at the Royal Over-Seas League, Park Place, St James’s 
Street, London SW1A 1LR on Thursday, 20 July 2017 at 
11.30 am. The notice of the annual general meeting and details 
of all of the resolutions to be put to shareholders are set out in 
a separate circular sent to shareholders at the same time as this 
annual report.
Directors
The directors of the company, all of whom served throughout 
the year, are shown on pages 34 and 35.
Directors’ indemnity
Each of the directors has the benefit, under the company’s 
articles of association, of an indemnity, to the extent permitted 
by the Companies Act 2006, against any liability incurred by 
him or her for negligence, default, breach of duty or breach 
of trust in relation to the affairs of the company.
Appointment and removal of directors and the 
articles of association
The appointment and removal of directors is governed by the 
company’s articles of association and prevailing company law.
The articles of association provide that at every annual general 
meeting one-third of the directors, or if not a multiple of three, 
the number nearest to one-third, shall retire by rotation and 
therefore be required to seek re-election by shareholders. New 
directors may be appointed by the board, but are subject to 
election by shareholders at the next annual general meeting of 
the company following their appointment. However, to comply 
with the provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code, the 
company requires that all directors should be subject to annual 
election by shareholders. Shareholders may also appoint new 
directors by ordinary resolution. The articles of association 
limit the number of directors to not less than two and not 
more than twelve, unless the shareholders resolve otherwise.
In accordance with changes to the Financial Conduct Authority’s 
Listing Rules introduced in 2014, the election of those directors 
determined by the board to be independent under the UK 
Corporate Governance Code must be subject to the approval 
of both all shareholders of the company and separately those 
shareholders who are not controlling shareholders, being the 
Cayzer Concert Party.
Customers and suppliers
The group’s policy in relation to all of its suppliers is to settle the 
terms of payment when agreeing the terms of the transaction. 
The group will abide by those terms on condition that it is 
satisfied that the supplier has provided the goods or services 
in accordance with the agreed terms and conditions. The group 
does not follow any code or statement on payment practice.
Going concern
The group’s business activities, together with the factors likely to 
affect its future development, performance and position are set 
out in the Chairman’s and Chief Executive’s report on pages 2 
to 7 and the investment review on pages 14 to 23. The financial 
position of the group, its cash flows, liquidity position and 
borrowing facilities are described in the financial review on pages 
24 to 26. In addition, note 21 to the financial statements includes 
the group’s capital management policies and procedures and 
processes for managing market risk and exposures to currency 
risk, interest rate risk, price risk, credit risk and liquidity risk.
The group has cash and other liquid resources and committed 
bank facilities available to meet existing and new investment 
commitments. As a consequence, the directors believe that 
the group is well placed to manage business risks successfully.
The directors have a reasonable expectation that the group has 
adequate resources to continue in operational existence for a 
period of at least twelve months from the date of approval of 
the financial statements. Accordingly, they continue to adopt the 
going concern basis in preparing the annual report and accounts. 
Viability statement
The directors have assessed the viability of the company over 
the three years to March 2020, taking account of the company’s 
position, its investment strategy, and the potential impact of 
the relevant principal risks set out on pages 29 to 31. In making 
this statement, the board is satisfied that the company operates 
an effective risk management process and confirms that it has 
conducted a robust assessment of the principal risks facing the 
company. This includes those that would threaten its strategic 
objectives, its business as usual state, its business model, and 
its future performance, solvency or liquidity. Based on this 
assessment, the directors have a reasonable expectation that 
the company will be able to continue in operation and meet 
its liabilities as they fall due over the period to March 2020.

In making this assessment, the directors took comfort from 
the results of a series of stress tests that considered the impact 
of a number of severe market downturn scenarios and loss 
of investment trust status on the company’s financial position 
and, in particular, its ability to settle projected liabilities of the 
company as they fall due. The directors determined that a three 
year period to March 2020 is an appropriate period for which to 
provide this statement given the company’s long term investment 
objective and the resilience demonstrated by the stress testing 
and the relatively low working capital requirements.

Statement of directors’ responsibilities in respect 
of the annual report and the financial statements
The directors are responsible for preparing the annual report, 
the Directors’ remuneration report and the financial 
statements in accordance with applicable law and regulations.
Company law requires the directors to prepare financial 
statements for each financial year. Under that law, the directors 
have prepared the group and parent company financial 
statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting 
Standards (‘IFRSs’) as adopted by the European Union. Under 
company law, the directors must not approve the financial 
statements unless they are satisfied that they give a true and 
fair view of the state of affairs of the group and the company 
and of the profit or loss of the group for that period. In preparing 
these financial statements, the directors are required to:
•	 select suitable accounting policies and then apply them 
consistently
•	 make judgements and accounting estimates that are 
reasonable and prudent
•	 state whether IFRSs as adopted by the European Union has 
been followed, subject to any material departures disclosed 
and explained in the group and parent company financial 
statements respectively
•	 prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis 
unless it is inappropriate to presume that the company will 
continue in business.
The directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting 
records that are sufficient to show and explain the company’s 
transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time 
the financial position of the company and the group and enable 
them to ensure that the financial statements and the Directors’ 
remuneration report comply with the Companies Act 2006 and, 
as regards the group financial statements, Article 4 of the IAS 
Regulation. They are also responsible for safeguarding the 
assets of the company and the group and hence for taking 
reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud 
and other irregularities.
The directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity 
of the company’s website. Legislation in the United Kingdom 
governing the preparation and dissemination of financial 
statements may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.
The directors consider that the annual report and accounts, 
taken as a whole, is fair, balanced and understandable and 
provides the information necessary for shareholders to assess 
the group’s performance and position, business model and 
strategy.
Disclosure of information to auditors
Each of the persons who is a director at the date of approval of 
this report confirms that:
1.  so far as the director is aware, there is no relevant 
information of which the company’s auditor is unaware
2.  the director has taken all steps that he or she ought to have 
taken as a director in order to make himself or herself aware 
of any relevant audit information and to establish that the 
company’s auditor is aware of that information.
This confirmation is given, and should be interpreted, in 
accordance with the provisions of section 418 of the Companies 
Act 2006.
Responsibility statement under the Disclosure 
Guidance and Transparency Rules and the UK 
Corporate Governance Code
Each of the directors, whose names and functions are listed on 
pages 34 and 35 confirm that, to the best of their knowledge:
1.  the group financial statements, which have been prepared in 
accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU, give a true and 
fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and profit 
of the group
2.  the strategic report contained on pages 2 to 33 includes a fair 
review of the development and performance of the business 
and the position of the group, together with a description of 
the principal risks and uncertainties that it faces.

2. Our assessment of risks of material misstatement
In arriving at our audit opinion above on the financial statements, the risks of material misstatement that had the greatest effect on our 
audit, is valuation of unlisted investments.  As in 2016, we continue to perform procedures over the carrying value of investments listed on 
recognised stock exchanges. However, as there is little judgement and a very low risk of misstatement,  we have not assessed this as one 
of the most significant risks and, therefore, it is not separately identified in our report this year.
The risk Our response
Valuation of unlisted investments
(£972.1m; 2016: £954.7m)
Refer to page 42 (Audit Committee 
Report), page 80 (accounting policy) and 
page 84 (financial disclosures).
Subjective valuation 
49.9% (2016: 57.0%) of the
group’s total assets (by value) is
held in investments where no
quoted market price is available.
Unlisted investments comprise
investments in equity, investment
property and funds.
Unlisted investments are
measured at fair value, which is
established in accordance with
International Private Equity and
Venture Capital Valuations
Guidelines by using
measurements of value such as
price of recent orderly
transactions, earnings multiples
and net assets and valuing fund
interests. There is a significant
risk over the application of these
judgements in the valuation and
therefore one of the key areas
that our audit focused on.
Investment properties, though
held through investee companies,
are subject to annual independent
valuation and measured
accordingly. The fair value
requires significant judgement
over the choice of valuation
methodology to apply, as well as
significant estimation, in particular
over the key assumptions of the
estimated rental value and the
yield. The key assumptions will
be impacted by a number of
factors including location, quality
and condition of the building and
tenant credit rating. Investment in
properties included in unquoted
pool amounted to £76.1m (2016:
£69.3m).
Our procedures included: 
Control design: Documenting and assessing the design and 
implementation and operational effectiveness of the investment 
valuation processes and controls;
Control observation: Attendance at bi-annual Challenge 
Committee meetings and Audit Committee meetings where we 
assessed the Audit Committee’s and Challenge Committee’s 
challenge and approval of unlisted investment valuations; 
Historical Comparisons: Assessment of investment realisations 
in the period, comparing actual investment sales proceeds to 
prior year-end valuations to understand the reasons for significant 
variance and determine whether they are indicative of bias and 
error in the group’s approach to valuations.
Methodology choice : In the context of observed industry best 
practice and the provisions of the Internal Private Equity and 
Venture Capital Valuation Guidelines, we challenged the 
appropriateness of the valuation basis selected. We also involved 
our own property valuation specialist to critically assess the 
methodology for compliance with the RICS Valuation Professional 
Standards ‘the Red Book’ and IFRS.
Our valuations experience: Challenging the investment 
manager on key judgments affecting investee company 
valuations, such as discount factors, and the choice of benchmark 
for earnings multiples. We compared key underlying financial data 
inputs to external sources such as financial information of 
comparable businesses, the investee company audited accounts 
and management information as applicable. We challenged the 
assumptions around sustainability of earnings based on the plans 
of investee companies and whether these are achievable and we 
obtained an understanding of existing and prospective investee 
company cash flows to understand whether borrowings can be 
serviced or refinancing may be required. Our work included 
consideration of events which occurred subsequent to the year 
end up until the date of this audit report. 
External Valuer’s credentials:  For the investment property 
valuations, we obtained the valuations performed by the external 
valuer and evaluated the competence, capabilities and objectivity 
of the valuer by analysing their valuation report using our own 
valuation specialists. Our valuation specialists, also considered 
the appropriateness of the external valuations and inherent 
assumptions by comparing the assumptions to externally derived 
data.
Comparing valuations: Where a recent transaction has been 
used to value any holding, we obtained an understanding of the 
circumstances surrounding the transaction and whether it was 
considered to be on an arm’s-length basis and suitable as an input 
into a valuation. We also assessed whether changes or events 
subsequent such as market or entity specific factors would imply 
a change in value. For the valuation of fund interests, we obtained 
and agreed the latest reported net asset values from the fund 
managers.
Assessing transparency: Consideration of the appropriateness, 
in accordance with relevant accounting standards, of the 
disclosures in respect of unlisted investments and the disclosure
of changing one or more inputs to reasonably possible alternative 
valuation assumptions.

3. Our application of materiality and an
overview of the scope of our audit
Materiality for Group financial statements as a whole 
was set at £17.5m (2016: £16.8m), determined with 
reference to a benchmark of total group assets, of 
which it represents 0.9% (2016: 1.0%).
We report to the Audit Committee any corrected and 
uncorrected identified misstatements exceeding 
£0.88m (2016: £0.84m) in addition to other identified 
misstatements that warranted reporting qualitative 
grounds.
The group audit team performed the audit of the 
group as if it was a single aggregated set of financial 
information. The audit was performed using the 
materiality levels set out above and covered 100% of 
total group revenue, group profit before tax and total 
group assets.

Process Plan: Single Page Merged HR NoColourInfo 4. Our opinion on other matters prescribed by the 
Companies Act 2006 is unmodified
In our opinion:
— the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be 
audited has been properly prepared in accordance with 
the Companies Act 2006; and
— the information given in the Strategic Report and the 
Directors’ Report for the financial year is consistent 
with the financial statements.
Based solely on the work required to be undertaken in the 
course of the audit of the financial statements and from 
reading the Strategic Report and the Directors’ Report:
— we have not identified material misstatements in those 
reports; and  
— in our opinion, those reports have been prepared in 
accordance with the Companies Act 2006. 
5. We have nothing to report on the disclosures of 
principal risks.
Based on the knowledge we acquired during our audit, we 
have nothing material to add or draw attention to in relation to:
— the directors’ viability statement on pages 66, 
concerning the principal risks, their management, and, 
based on that, the directors’ assessment and 
expectations of the group’s continuing in operation over 
the 3 years to 2020; or
— the disclosures in note 1 of the financial statements 
concerning the use of the going concern basis of 
accounting.
6. We have nothing to report in respect of the matters 
on which we are required to report by exception
Under ISAs (UK and Ireland) we are required to report to 
you if, based on the knowledge we acquired during our 
audit, we have identified other information in the annual 
report that contains a material inconsistency with either that 
knowledge or the financial statements, a material 
misstatement of fact, or that is otherwise misleading.
In particular, we are required to report to you if:
— we have identified material inconsistencies between 
the knowledge we acquired during our audit and the 
directors’ statement that they consider that the annual 
report and financial statements taken as a whole is fair, 
balanced and understandable and provides the 
information necessary for shareholders to assess the 
group’s position and performance, business model and 
strategy; or
— the Audit Committee Report does not appropriately 
address matters communicated by us to the audit 
committee. 
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to 
you if, in our opinion:
— adequate accounting records have not been kept by the 
parent company, or returns adequate for our audit have 
not been received from branches not visited by us; or
— the parent company financial statements and the part 
of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited are 
not in agreement with the accounting records and 
returns; or
— certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration specified 
by law are not made; or
— we have not received all the information and 
explanations we require for our audit.
Under the Listing Rules we are required to review:  
— the directors’ statements, set out on page 66, in 
relation to going concern and longer-term viability; and   
— the part of the Corporate Governance Statement on 
pages 36 to 39, relating to the company’s compliance 
with the eleven provisions of the 2014 UK Corporate 
Governance Code specified for our review.
We have nothing to report in respect of the above 
responsibilities.  
Scope and responsibilities
As explained more fully in the Directors’ Responsibilities 
Statement set out on page 68, the directors are responsible for 
the preparation of the financial statements and for being 
satisfied that they give a true and fair view. A description of the 
scope of an audit of financial statements is provided on the 
Financial Reporting Council’s website at 
www.frc.org.uk/auditscopeukprivate. This report is made solely 
to the Company’s members as a body and is subject to 
important explanations and disclaimers regarding our 
responsibilities, published on our website at 
www.kpmg.com/uk/auditscopeukco2014a, which are 
incorporated into this report as if set out in full and should be 
read to provide an understanding of the purpose of this report, 
the work we have undertaken and the basis of our opinions.

78 Annual report 2017 Caledonia Investments plc  
General information
Caledonia Investments plc is an investment trust company 
domiciled in the United Kingdom and incorporated in England in 
1928, under the Companies Acts 1908 to 1917 . The address of its 
registered office is 2nd Floor Stratton House, 5 Stratton Street, 
London W1J 8LA. The ordinary shares of the company are 
premium listed on the London Stock Exchange.
These financial statements were authorised for issue by the 
directors on 25 May 2017.
These financial statements are presented in pounds sterling, 
as this is the currency of the primary economic environment 
in which Caledonia operates.
Key sources of estimation uncertainty
Fair values of financial instruments
Most of the group’s financial instruments are measured at 
fair value in the statement of financial position and it is usually 
possible to determine their fair values within a reasonable 
range of estimates.
For actively traded financial instruments, quoted market prices 
are readily available. For other financial instruments, such as 
unlisted securities, valuation techniques are used to estimate 
fair value. Valuation techniques make maximum use of market 
inputs, including reference to the current fair values of 
instruments that are substantially the same (subject to 
appropriate adjustments).
Fair value estimates are made at a specific point in time, based 
on market conditions and information about the financial 
instrument. These estimates are subjective in nature and 
involve uncertainties and matters of significant judgement 
and therefore cannot be determined with precision. 
Significant accounting policies
Basis of accounting
These financial statements have been prepared in accordance 
with International Financial Reporting Standards (‘IFRSs’) as 
adopted by the EU and therefore the group financial statements 
comply with Article 4 of the EU IAS Regulation. IFRSs comprise 
accounting standards issued by the International Accounting 
Standards Board and its predecessor body as well as 
interpretations issued by the International Financial Reporting 
Interpretations Committee and its predecessor body.
The financial statements have been prepared on an historical 
cost basis, except for the revaluation of certain financial 
instruments and properties. Where presentational guidance set 
out in the Statement of Recommended Practice: Financial 
Statements of Investment Trust Companies and Venture Capital 
Trusts (‘SORP’) issued by the Association of Investment 
Companies in January 2017 is consistent with the requirements 
of IFRSs as adopted by the EU, the directors have sought to 
prepare the financial statements on a basis compliant with the 
recommendations of the SORP .
The statement of comprehensive income of the company has 
been omitted from these financial statements in accordance 
with section 408 of the Companies Act 2006.
Under the UK Corporate Governance Code and applicable 
regulations, the directors are required to satisfy themselves 
that it is reasonable to presume that the company is a going 
concern. The directors have a reasonable expectation that the 
company and the group have adequate resources to continue 
in operational existence for the foreseeable future, as 
discussed on page 66. Accordingly, they continue to adopt the 
going concern basis of preparing the financial statements.
Adopted IFRSs
In the current year, the group has not adopted any new 
standards or interpretations.
IFRSs not yet applied
At the date of approval of these financial statements, the 
following standards, which have not been applied in these 
financial statements, were in issue but not yet effective.
•	 IFRS 9 Financial Instruments 
•	 IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers
•	 IFRS 16 Leases
The directors anticipate that the adoption of these standards in 
future periods in their issued form will have no material impact 
on the financial statements.
Assessment as investment entity
Entities that meet the definition of an investment entity within 
IFRS 10 are required to account for most investments in 
controlled entities as held at fair value through profit or loss. 
Subsidiaries that provide investment related services or engage 
in permitted investment related activities with investees 
continue to be consolidated unless they are also investment 
entities. The board has concluded that the company meets the 
definition of an investment entity.
Basis of consolidation
In accordance with the IFRS 10/IAS 28 Investment entities 
amendments, the consolidated financial statements include the 
financial statements of the company and service entities 
controlled by the company made up to the reporting date. 
Control is achieved where the company has the power over the 
potential investee as a result of voting or other rights, has rights 
to positive or negative variable returns from its involvement 
with the investee and has the ability to use its power over the 
investee to affect significantly the amount of its returns.

79 Annual report 2017 Caledonia Investments plc  
Foreign currencies
Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded at the rate of 
exchange ruling at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets 
and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the 
reporting date are translated to the functional currency at the 
foreign exchange rate ruling at the reporting date. Non-
monetary assets and liabilities that are measured in terms of 
historical cost in a foreign currency are translated to the 
functional currency using the exchange rate at the date of the 
transaction. Non-monetary assets and liabilities denominated 
in foreign currencies that are stated at fair value are translated 
to the functional currency at foreign exchange rates ruling at 
the dates the fair values were determined.
In the financial statements, foreign exchange gains or losses are 
recognised in capital or revenue reserve depending on whether 
the gain or loss is of a capital or revenue nature respectively.
Income
Dividends receivable on equity shares are recognised as 
revenue when the shareholders’ right to receive payment has 
been established, normally the ex-dividend date. Where no 
ex-dividend date is available, dividends receivable on or before 
the period end are treated as revenue for the period. Provision 
is made for any dividends not expected to be received.
The fixed returns on debt securities, loans and non-equity 
shares are recognised on an effective interest rate basis, which 
is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash receipts 
through the expected life of the financial asset to that asset’s 
net carrying amount.
Rental income is recognised on a straight-line basis over the 
lease term.
The company’s share of net income from limited partnerships is 
recognised as revenue when received.
Where uncertainty arises over the collectability of an amount 
already included in income, the uncollectible amount or the 
amount in respect of which the recovery has ceased to be 
probable, is recognised as an expense. When the uncertainty over 
collectability is removed, normally on receipt, the income is 
recognised in the Statement of comprehensive income.
Expenses
All expenses are accounted for on an accrual basis. In the 
financial statements, ongoing management expenses are 
included in revenue reserves, whereas performance fees and 
share-based payment expenses – costs relating to 
compensation schemes that are linked directly to investment 
performance – are included in capital reserves. Expenses of 
acquisition of an investment designated as held at fair value 
through profit or loss or expenses of an aborted acquisition or 
disposal of an investment are presented as transaction costs, or 
deducted from the proceeds of sale as appropriate, and 
included in capital reserves.
Operating leases
Rentals payable under operating leases are charged to income 
on a straight-line basis over the term of the relevant lease.
Employee benefits
Pension schemes
Payments to defined contribution schemes are charged as an 
expense as they fall due.
For defined benefit schemes, the cost of providing benefits 
is determined using the projected unit credit method, with 
actuarial valuations being carried out at each reporting date. 
Re-measurement gains and losses are recognised in full in the 
period in which they occur in other comprehensive income.
Past service cost is recognised immediately in the period of a 
plan amendment.
The retirement benefit obligation recognised in the Statement 
of financial position represents the present value of the defined 
benefit obligations as reduced by the fair value of scheme 
assets. Any asset resulting from this calculation is limited to the 
present value of available refunds and reductions in future 
contributions to the plan.
Profit sharing and bonus plans
The group recognises a liability and an expense for bonuses and 
profit sharing, based on a formula that takes into consideration 
the profit attributable to the company’s shareholders after 
certain adjustments. The group recognises a provision where 
contractually obliged or where there is a past practice that has 
created a constructive obligation.
Share-based payments
The group issues equity-settled share-based payments to 
certain employees. Equity-settled share-based payments are 
measured at fair value at the date of grant and the fair value is 
expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based 
on the group’s estimate of the number of shares that will 
eventually vest.
Where employees of a subsidiary are granted rights to the 
equity instruments of its parent as consideration for the 
services provided to the subsidiary, the subsidiary recognises 
an equity-settled share-based payment transaction expense 
with a corresponding increase recognised in equity 
representing a contribution from the parent. In addition, the 
parent recognises an increase in equity and an increase in 
subsidiary investment equivalent to the amount of the 
share-based payment transaction.
An employee share trust is used for distributing option and 
performance share and deferred bonus awards to employees 
under Caledonia’s share remuneration schemes. The trustee 
purchases shares with money lent interest free by Caledonia 
and transfers shares to participating employees on receipt of 
the requisite consideration or calling of awards.

80 Annual report 2017 Caledonia Investments plc  
The transactions the employee share trust undertakes are 
considered to be performed by the trust as an agent for Caledonia. 
The transactions of the employee share trust are included in 
the separate financial statements of the parent company and, 
following the requirements of IFRS 10, in the consolidated financial 
statements as if they arose in that company. Own shares held by 
the employee share trust as at the reporting date are accounted 
for as if they were treasury shares.
National Insurance on share option scheme gains and 
performance share and deferred bonus awards
National Insurance payable on the exercise of certain employee 
share options and performance share awards at the date of 
exercise and deferred bonus awards at the date of call has been 
charged as an expense spread over the respective vesting 
periods. The charge is based on the difference between the 
market value of the underlying shares at the reporting date 
and the exercise price for share options or £nil for performance 
share awards and deferred bonus awards and calculated at the 
latest enacted National Insurance rate.
Taxation
The tax expense represents the sum of tax currently payable 
and deferred tax.
The tax currently payable is based on the taxable profit for the 
period. Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in the 
Statement of comprehensive income because it excludes items 
of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other 
periods and it further excludes items that are never taxable 
or deductible. The group’s liability for current tax is calculated 
using tax rates that were applicable at the reporting date.
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable 
on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and 
liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding tax 
bases used in the computation of taxable profit and is 
accounted for using the liability method. Deferred tax liabilities 
are recognised for all taxable temporary differences and 
deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is 
probable that future taxable profits will be available against 
which deductible temporary differences can be utilised. 
Investment trust companies that have approval as such under 
section 1159 of the Corporation Tax Act 2010 are not liable 
for taxation on capital gains.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each 
reporting date and adjusted to the extent that it is probable 
that sufficient future taxable profits will be available to allow 
all or part of the assets to be recovered.
Dividend distribution
Dividends are recognised in the period in which they are 
appropriately authorised and no longer at the discretion of the 
entity. For interim dividends, this will normally mean the date 
on which they are paid and, for final dividends, the date on 
which they are approved in general meeting.
Investments
Investments are recognised and derecognised on a trade date, 
where a purchase or sale of an investment is under a contract 
whose terms require delivery of the investment within the 
timeframe established by the market concerned, and are 
initially measured at cost, excluding transaction costs.
Investments held as part of the group’s business of investing 
in financial assets are designated as held at fair value through 
profit or loss in both the consolidated financial statements 
and the company financial statements.
Investments designated as held at fair value through profit or 
loss are measured at subsequent reporting dates at fair value. 
Gains or losses arising from changes in the value of investments 
designated as held at fair value through profit or loss, including 
foreign exchange movements, are included in net profit or loss 
for the period as a capital return.
Listed investments are valued at bid price or the last traded 
price when a bid price is not available. Unlisted investments 
are valued using recognised valuation methodologies, based on 
the International Private Equity and Venture Capital Valuation 
Guidelines, which reflect the amount for which an asset could 
be exchanged between knowledgeable, willing parties on an 
arm’s length basis. The portfolio valuation methodology is 
detailed on page 27.
Distributions from investment limited partnerships are treated 
as disposal proceeds or income in accordance with the nature 
of the distribution. Any surplus capital distributions after 
repaying partner’s capital are treated as realised gains.
Derivative financial instruments
Derivatives are recognised at fair value on the date a contract 
is entered into and are subsequently re-measured at their fair 
value.
Hedge accounting is not applied. Changes in the fair value 
of derivative financial instruments are recognised in the 
Statement of comprehensive income as they arise.
Capital reserve
The company maintains a capital reserve. The following items 
are transferred into the capital reserve from profit or loss:
•	 gains and losses on investments held at fair value through 
profit or loss
•	 gains and losses on derivatives used to hedge the fair value 
of investments
•	 fees and share-based payment expenses linked to 
investment performance
•	 expenses and finance costs incurred directly in relation 
to capital transactions
•	 actuarial gains and losses on defined benefit pension 
schemes
•	 taxation on items recognised in the capital reserve.

Property, plant and equipment
Property is measured at fair value. Gains arising from changes 
in the fair value are included in other comprehensive income 
for the period in which they arise and losses included in profit 
or loss. To the extent gains represent the reversal of cumulative 
losses previously recognised they are included in profit or loss.
Plant and equipment is measured at cost less accumulated 
depreciation and any accumulated impairment loss.
Assets in course of construction are measured at cost less any 
accumulated impairment loss.
Depreciation is calculated to write off the fair value or cost of 
items of property, plant and equipment less their estimated 
residual values using the straight-line method over their 
estimated useful lives. Land and assets in course of 
construction are not depreciated.
The estimated useful lives of property, plant and equipment 
are as follows:
Buildings  25-50 years 
Office equipment 3-5 years
Accumulated depreciation on revalued property is eliminated 
against the gross carrying amount of the asset.
The gain or loss on the disposal or retirement of an asset is 
determined as the difference between the sales proceeds and 
the carrying amount of the asset and is recognised in the 
Statement of comprehensive income.
Impairment of assets
At each reporting date, the group reviews the carrying amounts 
of its tangible and intangible assets to determine whether there is 
any indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss. 
If any such indication exists, an impairment loss is recognised 
for the amount by which the asset’s carrying amount exceeds 
its recoverable amount, if any. The recoverable amount is the 
higher of an asset’s fair value less costs to sell and value in use. 
Receivables
Receivables do not carry any interest and are stated at their 
nominal value as reduced by appropriate allowances for 
estimated irrecoverable amounts.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash comprises cash in hand and demand deposits. Cash 
equivalents are short term, highly liquid investments that are 
readily convertible to known amounts of cash and that are 
subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value.
Borrowings
Interest-bearing bank loans and overdrafts are recorded at 
the fair value of proceeds received, net of direct issue costs. 
Finance charges, including premiums payable on settlement 
or redemption and direct issue costs, are accounted for on an 
accrual basis in the Statement of comprehensive income using 
the effective interest method and are added to the carrying 
amount of the instrument to the extent that they are not 
settled in the period in which they arise. The effective interest 
method allocates the interest expense over the life of the 
instrument so as to reflect a constant return on the carrying 
amount of the liability.
Provisions
A provision is recognised in the Statement of financial 
position when the company has a present legal or constructive 
obligation as a result of a past event, and it is probable that 
an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle 
the obligation. Provisions are measured at the directors’ best 
estimate of the expenditure required to settle the obligation 
at the reporting date and are discounted to present value 
where the effect is material.
In the financial statements, provisions recognised for 
investments are included in the Statement of comprehensive 
income as a capital return.
Share capital
Equity instruments issued by the company are recorded 
as the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
Where the Caledonia Investments plc Employee Share Trust 
purchases the company’s equity share capital, the consideration 
paid, including any directly attributable incremental costs (net 
of income taxes), is deducted from equity attributable to the 
company’s owners until the shares are transferred. Where such 
shares are subsequently transferred, any consideration received, 
net of any directly attributable incremental transaction costs and 
the related income tax effects, is included in equity attributable 
to the company’s owners.
Operating segments
Operating segments are based on the financial information 
reported to the chief operating decision maker.

During the year, the solvency guarantee provision was increased 
based on a review of the obligations and fully utilised in settlement 
of those obligations. The solvency guarantee provision related to 
a subsidiary that had a claim against it, but insufficient resources 
to settle any such obligations. The provision was estimated 
based on the amount of the claim against the subsidiary. 
During the prior year, the litigation provision was fully used 
against costs incurred as the legal claim was settled in full. 
The litigation provision related to a claim arising from the 
acquisition of a subsidiary in 2013. 
With the exception of the litigation provision, these provisions 
were allocated to the capital reserve. As the matters that gave 
rise to the provisions were expected to be resolved over the 
next year, all provisions were classified as current liabilities.

The company had outstanding share options and performance 
share scheme and deferred bonus awards (note 22).
As at 31 March 2017, the issued share capital of the company 
comprised 55,381,017 ordinary shares (2016 – 55,381,017) and 
8,000,000 deferred ordinary shares (2016 – 8,000,000). The 
ordinary and deferred ordinary shares have a nominal value 
of 5p each.
The holders of the ordinary shares are entitled to receive 
dividends as declared from time to time and are entitled to one 
vote per share at meetings of the company. In respect of the 
company’s ordinary shares that are held by subsidiaries, all 
voting rights are suspended.
The deferred ordinary shares carry no voting rights and are 
not redeemable. They carry the right to a fixed cumulative 
preference dividend of 1% per annum (exclusive of any 
associated tax credit) of the nominal value of such deferred 
ordinary shares, being 0.05p per share, or £4,000 in aggregate, 
for all such shares currently in issue. The company is required 
to pay the dividend to the extent that it has distributable 
profits. On a winding-up or other return of capital, the deferred 
ordinary shares carry the right to the payment of the amount 
paid up on such shares only after holders of the ordinary shares 
have received the sum of £100,000 in respect of each such 
ordinary share. All of the deferred ordinary shares are held by 
Sterling Industries Ltd, a wholly-owned group company.
16. Net asset value per share
The group’s undiluted net asset value per share is based on the 
net assets of the group at the year end and on the number of 
ordinary shares in issue at the year end less ordinary shares 
held by the Caledonia Investments plc Employee Share Trust. 
The group’s diluted net asset value per share assumes the 
exercise of all outstanding in-the-money share options and 
the calling of performance share and deferred bonus awards.

deducting the second interim dividend of £21.1m, which had an 
ex-dividend date of 3 March 2016 and was paid on 1 April 2016.
17. Operating segments
The chief operating decision maker has been identified as the 
Executive Committee, which reviews the company’s internal 
reporting in order to assess performance and allocate 
resources. Management has determined the operating 
segments based on these reports.
The performance of operating segments is assessed on a 
measure of group total revenue, principally comprising gains 
and losses on investments and derivatives hedging those 
investments and investment income. Reportable profit or loss 
is after treasury income and ‘Other items’, which comprise 
management and other expenses and provisions. Reportable 
assets equate to the group’s total assets. Cash and cash 
equivalents and other items are not identifiable operating 
segments.
‘Other investments’ comprise subsidiaries not managed as part 
of the investment portfolio.

18. Related parties
Identity of related parties
The group and company had related party relationships with its 
subsidiaries (note 25) and associates (note 24) and with its key 
management personnel, being its directors.
Transactions with key management personnel

had significant influence in The Cayzer Trust Company Ltd, 
which held 35.0% of the voting shares of the company as at 
31 March 2017 (2016 – 35.5%). 
During the year, the group invoiced and received £0.1m 
(2016 – £0.1m) in rent and administration fees from The Cayzer 
Trust Company Ltd. In addition, the company’s Employee Share 
Trust purchased 300,000 shares from The Cayzer Trust 
Company Ltd at the prevailing market price, for £7.3m.
In addition to their salaries, the group provided non-cash and 
post-employment benefits to directors and executive officers. 
Details of directors’ pension benefits are set out in the 
Directors’ remuneration report on page 57.

19. Capital commitments
At the reporting date, the group and company had entered 
into unconditional commitments to limited partnerships, 
commitments to other investment funds and loan facilities 
to portfolio companies, as follows:

20. Contingencies
The company has provided guarantees capped at £6.5m, 
£3.7m and £5.0m to the trustees of the Caledonia Pension 
Scheme, the Sterling Industries Pension Scheme and the 
Amber Industrial Holdings PLC Pension & Life Assurance 
Scheme respectively in respect of the liabilities of the 
participating employers of those schemes.
21. Financial instruments
Financial instruments comprise securities and other 
investments, cash balances, borrowings and receivables and 
payables that arise from operations. The investment portfolio 
includes listed and unlisted equity investments, debt 
instruments and investments in funds that are intended to be 
held for the long term.
Risk analysis
The main types of financial risk to which the group is exposed 
are market risk, credit risk and liquidity risk.
The nature and extent of the financial instruments outstanding 
at the reporting date and the risk management policies 
employed are discussed below.
Market risk
Market risk embodies the potential for both losses and gains and 
includes price risk, currency risk and fair value interest rate risk.
The strategy for managing market risk is driven by the 
investment objective, which is to outperform the FTSE 
All-Share Total Return index over rolling ten year periods. 
Investments are made in a range of instruments, including 
listed and unlisted equities, debt and non-equity investment 
funds, in a range of sectors and regions.
Price risk
Price risk may affect the value of listed and unlisted 
investments as a result of changes in market prices (other than 
arising from interest rate risk or currency risk), whether caused 
by factors specific to an individual investment, its issuer or 
factors affecting all instruments traded in the market.
As the majority of financial instruments are carried at fair 
value, with fair value changes recognised in the Statement of 
comprehensive income, all changes in market conditions will 
directly affect reported portfolio returns.
Price risk is managed by constructing a diversified portfolio of 
instruments traded on various markets and hedging where 
appropriate.
The exposures of listed and unlisted equity investments, equity 
linked bonds and funds were as follows:
Group Company
2017 
£m 
2016

£m 
2016

Investments held at fair 
value through profit or loss 1,668.3 1,565.3 1,682.9 1,580.5 
The following table details the sensitivity to a 10% variation in 
equity prices. The sensitivity analysis includes all equity and 
fund investments held at fair value through profit or loss and 
adjusts their valuation at the year end for a 10% change in 
value.

Increase in prices 166.8 156.5 168.3 158.1 
Decrease in prices (166.8) (156.5) (168.3) (158.1)
The sensitivity to equity and fund investments has increased 
during the year due to investment portfolio gains partly offset 
by net realisations in the year.
In management’s opinion, the sensitivity analysis is 
unrepresentative of the inherent price risk as the year end 
exposure does not reflect the exposure throughout the year 
as a whole.
Currency risk
Investments in financial instruments and other transactions 
may be denominated in currencies other than the functional 
currency. Consequently, there is exposure to the risk that the 
exchange rate of the functional currency may change relative 
to other currencies in a manner that has an adverse effect on 
the value of that portion of assets and liabilities denominated 
in currencies other than the functional currency.
The company’s non-functional currency denominated 
investments and gains and losses thereon are reviewed 
regularly by the directors and the currency risk is managed by 
the directors within the overall asset allocation strategies.

The exposure to foreign currency has reduced in the year due 
to a reduction in foreign denominated cash and cash equivalents.
Interest rate risk
Interest rate movements may affect the fair value of investments 
in fixed interest securities and the level of income receivable 
from fixed income securities and cash at bank and on deposit.
The company and group held cash at bank and term deposits, 
with the term to maturity of up to three months, and floating 
rate, interest-bearing financial assets. The group also held 
fixed rate, interest-bearing financial assets, with maturities 
of up to five years. 
The exposure to interest rate risk on financial assets and 
liabilities was as follows:

The sensitivity analysis below has been determined based on 
the exposure to interest rates at the reporting date from a 50 
basis point change taking place at the beginning of the financial 
year and held constant throughout the year. This level of change 
is considered to be reasonable, based on observation of market 
conditions and historic trends.

Decrease in interest rates (0.5) (0.1) (0.8) 0.1 
Increase in interest rates 0.5 0.1 0.8 (0.1)
The group’s and company’s sensitivity to interest rates has 
changed in the year due to an increase in net cash and floating 
rate loans, against a smaller increase in fixed interest loans with 
a relatively higher rate of interest.
Credit risk
Credit risk is the risk that the counterparty to a financial 
instrument will fail to discharge an obligation or commitment. 
A credit policy is in place and exposure to credit risk is regularly 
monitored.
The exposure to credit risk in financial assets was as follows: 
Group Company

2016

Cash and cash equivalents 207.3 22.9 205.6 23.8 
235.4 75.1 234.7 71.2
Prior to making investments in debt instruments, management 
has in place a process of review that includes an evaluation of 
a potential investee company’s ability to service and repay its 
debt. Management reviews the financial position of investee 
companies, including their continuing ability to service and 
repay debt, on a regular basis.
The exposure to credit risk on operating and other receivables 
is mitigated by performing credit evaluations on investee 
companies as part of the due diligence process.
Credit risk arising on money market funds and cash and cash 
equivalents is mitigated by spreading investments and deposits 
across a number of approved counterparties in accordance with 
board policy. These are either investment grade banks with a 
credit rating of ‘AA3’ or ‘AA-‘ or higher, as determined by the 
rating agencies Moody’s and Fitch, or banks specifically approved 
by the board. These credit ratings are reviewed regularly.
At the year end, the group and company had cash deposits with 
the Royal Bank of Scotland plc of £45.4m (2016 – £18.9m) and 
£43.8m (2016 – £19.8m) respectively. In addition, the group 
and company had sterling liquidity funds of £160m (2016 – £nil) 
invested equally between Goldman Sachs Sterling Liquid 
Reserves Fund, HSBC Sterling Liquidity Fund, Blackrock 
Institutional Sterling Liquidity Fund and Standard Life 
Investments Liquidity Fund plc Sterling.
All transactions in listed securities are settled on contract terms 
using approved brokers. The risk of default is considered minimal, 
as delivery of securities sold is only made once the broker has 
received payment. Payment is made on a purchase once the 
securities have been received by the broker. The trade will fail 
if either party fails to meet their obligations. Listed security 
trades are settled through HSBC Global Custody.

Fair value
Most of the financial instruments are carried at fair value in 
the Statement of financial position. Usually, the fair value of 
the financial instruments can be reliably determined within 
a reasonable range of estimates. For certain other financial 
instruments, specifically operating and other receivables and 
payables, the carrying amounts approximate fair value due to the 
immediate or short term nature of these financial instruments.
Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk arises as a result of the possibility that the group 
and company may not be able to meet its obligations as they 
fall due.
The corporate treasury function provides services to the 
company and group, coordinating access to domestic financial 
markets for both borrowing and depositing. Group companies 
access local financial markets when this is more favourable, 
in liaison with the corporate treasury function. Executive 
management monitors the group’s liquidity on a weekly basis, 
including the level of undrawn committed bank facilities.
Bank facilities were undrawn at 31 March 2017 and 2016. 
Capital management policies and procedures
The group’s capital management objectives are:
•	 to ensure that the group and company will be able to continue 
as a going concern
•	 to maximise the income and capital return to the company’s 
shareholders, principally through the use of equity capital, 
although the group will maintain appropriate borrowing 
facilities, to be used for short term working capital or 
bridging finance, currently £175m (2016 – £175m).
The group’s total capital at 31 March 2017 was £1,898.8m 
(2016 – £1,644.3m) and comprised equity share capital and 
reserves. The group was ungeared at the year end (2016 – 
ungeared) and had a further £175m of undrawn committed 
bank facilities.
The board monitors and reviews the broad structure of the 
group’s and company’s capital on an ongoing basis. This review 
includes:
•	 the planned level of gearing, which takes into account 
planned investment activity
•	 the possible buy-back of equity shares for cancellation, which 
takes account of the discount of the share price to net asset 
value per share
•	 the annual dividend policy.
The group’s objectives, policies and processes for managing 
capital are unchanged from the preceding year.
The parent company is subject to the following externally 
imposed capital requirements:
•	 as a public limited company, the company is required to have 
a minimum issued share capital of £50,000
•	 to maintain its approval as an investment trust company, the 
company is required to comply with the provisions of section 
1158 of the Corporation Tax Act 2010 as amended by the 
Investment Trust (Approved Company) (Tax) Regulations 2011.
The parent company has complied with these requirements, 
which are unchanged since the previous year end.
Fair value hierarchy
The table below analyses financial instruments held at fair 
value according to the subjectivity of the valuation method, 
using the following hierarchy:
Level 1  Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for 
identical assets.
Level 2  Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 
1 that are directly or indirectly observable.
Level 3  Inputs for the asset that are not based on observable 
market data.

1,688.6 1,609.2 1,682.2 1,604.7
In the prior year, group and company investments with a value 
of £45.3m were transferred from Level 3 to Level 2, as a result 
of quoted market fund valuations derived from observable 
market prices.

The directors have used several valuation methodologies as 
prescribed in the valuation guidelines to arrive at their best 
estimate of fair value, including the price of recent investments, 
revenue and earnings multiples and recent market transactions 
where available.

91 Annual report 2017 Caledonia Investments plc  
Significant observable inputs used in measuring Level 2 
financial instruments were developed as follows:
•	 Manager NAVs, indirectly derived from observable quoted 
market prices of underlying investments.
•	 Property valuations, indirectly derived from observable market 
data including multiples from prices in observed transactions 
involving comparable buildings in similar locations.
Significant unobservable inputs used in measuring Level 3 
financial instruments were developed as follows:
•	 EBITDA multiples represent amounts that market participants 
would use when pricing investments. EBITDA multiples are 
selected from comparable public companies based on 
geographic location, industry, size, target markets and other 
factors that management consider reasonable. The traded 
multiples for comparable companies are determined by 
dividing the enterprise value of the company by its EBITDA. 
EBITDA multiples ranged from 7 to 17 (2016 – 9 to 17), 
weighted average 9.1 (2016 – 10.4).
•	 Marketability discounts represent the adjustment to 
comparable market multiples to reflect the illiquidity of 
the portfolio companies relative to the comparable peer 
group. Management determines the discount for lack of 
marketability based on its judgement, after considering 
market liquidity conditions and company specific factors 
such as the development stage of the portfolio company. 
Marketability discount rates ranged from 25% to 30%  
(2016 – 23% to 30%), weighted average 29% (2016 – 26%).
The table below sets out information about Level 3 investments

managers represented fair value at the reporting date.
2.  The entity has determined that independent third party valuations represented 
fair value at the reporting date.
Private equity fund investments, included in Level 3, are valued 
in accordance with the valuation guidelines and are based on 
information provided by the general partners. The general 
partners’ policy in valuing unlisted investments is to carry them 
at fair value. Similarly, externally managed unquoted investment 
valuations are based on information provided by the managers.
22. Share-based payments
The company has an executive share option scheme, which 
entitles senior employees to purchase shares in the company 
at the market price of the shares at the date of grant and on 
similar terms, subject to service and company performance 
criteria. Under the terms of the scheme, options may be 
exercised between three and ten years after the date of grant, 
although only one-third of the options may be exercised after 
three years from grant, with the remaining two-thirds becoming 
exercisable six years after grant. A number of grants have been 
made under this scheme.
In 2011, shareholders approved a new performance share 
scheme to replace the existing share option scheme as the 
means of delivering long term incentive awards to senior 
executives. The performance share scheme entitles senior 
executives to receive options over the company’s shares which 
are exercisable at nil-cost, subject to service and performance 
conditions. Nil-cost option awards granted in 2012 may be 
exercised between three and ten years after the date of grant, 
although only two-thirds of the awards may be exercised after 
three years, with the remaining one-third becoming exercisable 
five years after grant. For nil-cost option awards granted in 
2013 and 2014, half of the shares comprised in the awards may 
be exercised after three years, and half after five years. For 
nil-cost option awards granted in 2015 onwards, one-third 
of the shares comprised in the awards may be exercised after 
three years, and two-thirds after five years.
The company also has a deferred bonus plan, under which 
senior employees compulsorily defer part of their annual 
bonus, being any bonus in excess of 50% of their basic salary 
for the bonus year, into shares and may voluntarily defer up to 
50% of their remaining cash bonus into shares. The company 
will match the number of shares comprised in both compulsory 
and voluntary deferral, subject to service and company 
performance criteria.

The fair value of services received in return for performance 
share scheme and deferred awards granted was measured 
indirectly, by reference to the share price at the date of grant.
Under the schemes, share options were granted with service 
and non-market performance conditions. Such conditions were 
not taken into account in the fair value measurement of the 
services received at the dates of grant. There were no market 
conditions associated with the share option grants.
The fair value of services received in return for deferred share 
awards was measured directly, by reference to the fair value of 
services received during the period. This was based on the 
amount of annual bonus that was compulsorily and voluntarily 
deferred in accordance with the rules of the company’s 
deferred bonus plan.

Defined benefit pension obligations
The group makes contributions to two (2016 – two) plans in the 
UK that provide pension benefits for employees. The schemes 
are approved by HMRC for tax purposes and operated 
separately from the group being managed by an independent 
set of trustees, whose appointment is determined by the 
schemes’ documentation and legislation. The schemes are 
subject to UK funding regulations, which require the group and 
the trustees to agree a funding strategy and contribution 
schedule where necessary. Both schemes were closed to new 
members in April 1996. New employees joining after that date 
were offered alternative defined contribution pension 
arrangements.

Mortality rates are assumed to follow the Self-Administered 
Pension Schemes ‘Series 2’ Light tables applicable to each 
member’s year of birth, projected to calendar year 2012 in line 
with the core CMI scale of improvements. Allowance has also 
been made for further improvements in line with CMI core 
projections with a long term trend of 1.5% pa. Life expectancy 
on retirement in normal health is assumed to be 27 .6 years 
(2016 – 27 .5 years) for males and 28.2 years (2016 – 28.0 years) 
for females who are currently 62 years of age.
Expected contributions to group post-employment benefit plans 
for the year ending 31 March 2018 were £0.3m (2017 – £0.4m).
In the UK, the funding is set on the basis of a triennial funding 
valuation by the actuaries for which the assumptions may differ 
from those above. As a result of these valuations, the group and 
the scheme trustees agree a Schedule of Contributions, which 
sets out the required contributions from the employer and 
employees for current service. Where the scheme is in deficit, 
the Schedule of Contributions also includes required contributions 
from the employer to eliminate the deficit. The most recent 
triennial valuations were completed in 2015. A summary of 
the recent funding obligations and weighted average duration 
of the defined benefit obligations was as follows:

Sensitivities
the estimated increase in defined benefit obligations to a change 
in individual actuarial assumptions, while holding all other 
assumptions constant. This sensitivity analysis may not be 
representative of the actual change in the defined benefit 
obligation as it is unlikely that the change in an assumption would 
occur in isolation, as some of the assumptions may be correlated.

Increase in life expectancy of one year 1.8 1.2
Risks
The pension schemes typically expose the group to risks such as:
•	 Investment risk – the schemes hold their investments in 
equities and bonds, the value of which fluctuates, whether 
caused by factors specific to an individual investment, its 
issuer or factors affecting all instruments traded in the 
market.
•	 Interest rate risk – the schemes’ liabilities are assessed using 
market rates of interest, based on corporate bond yields, 
to discount the liabilities and are therefore subject to any 
volatility in the movement of the market rate of interest. 
The net interest income or expense recognised in profit 
or loss is calculated using the market rate of interest.
•	 Inflation risk – a significant proportion of the benefits under 
the schemes is linked to inflation. Although the schemes’ 
assets are expected to provide a good hedge against inflation 
over the long term, movements over the short term would 
increase the schemes’ net deficit.
•	 Mortality risk – in the event that members live longer than 
assumed, the liabilities may turn out to have been understated 
originally and a deficit may emerge if funding has not been 
adequately provided for the increased life expectancy.

Information for investors
Dividends, change of address and other 
shareholder services
Shareholders who wish to have dividends paid directly into 
a UK bank account, rather than by cheque to their registered 
address, can complete a mandate form for this purpose. 
Mandates may be obtained from Capita Asset Services. Where 
dividends are paid directly into shareholders’ bank accounts, 
dividend confirmation statements are sent to shareholders’ 
registered addresses.
Capita Asset Services also offer an international payment 
service whereby overseas shareholders may convert their 
dividend payments into a chosen currency and receive payment 
either in the form of a currency draft or by a direct payment into 
an overseas bank account. Details of the currencies available 
under this service and how to apply, including terms and 
conditions, are available online at www.signalshares.com (by 
clicking on ‘your dividend options’ and following the on-screen 
instructions) or an application pack can be requested by 
telephone on 0871 664 0300 or +44 371 664 0300 if calling from 
outside the United Kingdom. Calls cost 12p per minute plus your 
phone company’s access charge and calls outside the United 
Kingdom will be charged at the applicable international rate. 
Lines are open between 9am and 5.30pm, Monday to Friday 
excluding public holidays in England and Wales.
Communications with shareholders are mailed to the address 
held on the share register. In the event of a change of address 
or other amendment, shareholders should notify Capita Asset 
Services, under the signature of the registered holder, or where 
there is more than one registered holder, under the signature 
of the first named holder.
Post and telephone contact details for Capita Asset Services are 
shown on the opposite page. Capita Asset Services also provide 
an online facility to enable shareholders to manage securely 
their shareholdings via the internet. By registering to use the 
facility, shareholders can access a range of online services, 
including viewing shareholding details, transaction and 
dividend histories, change of address and bank mandate and 
use of the online proxy voting service. The online facility is 
available at www.signalshares.com.
Capita Asset Services also offer a share dealing service and 
dividend reinvestment plan for existing shareholders. The share 
dealing service is available online at www.signalshares.com or by 
telephone on 0371 664 0445 or +44 371 664 0445 if calling from 
outside the United Kingdom. Calls are charged at the standard 
geographic rate and will vary by provider. Calls outside the United 
Kingdom will be charged at the standard geographic rate and will 
vary by provider. Lines are open between 8am and 4.30pm, 
Monday to Friday excluding public holidays in England and Wales.
The dividend reinvestment plan provides a convenient way 
for shareholders to build up their shareholdings by using cash 
dividends to buy more shares in the company. You can elect for 
the dividend reinvestment plan online at www.signalshares.com, 
where you can view the terms of service, or you can request 
an application form by telephone on 0371 664 0381 or 
+44 371 664 0381 if calling from outside the United Kingdom. 
Calls cost 12p per minute plus your phone company’s access 
charge. Calls outside the UK will be charged at the applicable 
international rate. Lines are open between 9am and 5.30pm,

Process Plan: Single Page Merged HR NoColourInfo Welcome to Caledonia
Caledonia is a self-managed investment trust company with net assets of 
£1.9bn. Our aim is to grow net assets and dividends paid to shareholders 
over the long term, whilst managing risk to mitigate volatility of returns. 
We achieve this by investing in proven well-managed businesses that 
combine long term growth characteristics with an ability to deliver 
increasing levels of income. Our investments cover both listed and 
private markets in broadly equal proportions, a range of sectors and, 
in particular through our fund investments, a global reach. 
The success of this strategy can be seen in the performance of Caledonia’s 
NAV per share total return measured against the FTSE All-Share since 
1987 and a record of 50 years of increasing its annual dividends.
