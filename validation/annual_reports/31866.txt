Who We Are
SUSTAINABILITY
AT THE HEART OF 
EVERYTHING WE DO
Inland Homes is an established land 
regeneration business, focused on 
developing sites in the south and south  
east of England for residential and mixed 
use projects. Our foundations have been 
built on a proactive and decisive approach 
to identifying the right land opportunities, 
and our ability to navigate the complex 
planning system and maximising the 
potential of the final development.
Our versatile structure, local insight  
and opportunistic approach gives us  
a competitive advantage, ensuring we 
can react fast to secure the sites we want 
at a price that provides healthy returns. 
Once secured, our knowledge of and 
relationships with local authorities, and 
the wealth of experience in our land and 
planning teams, means that we are able  
to secure valuable planning consent for  
the sites we own and manage.
Our ambitious developments, combining 
style, comfort and sustainability for a wide 
social demographic, deliver appropriate 
rewards for our business, our stakeholders, 
our shareholders and the local community. 
Increasingly, we are utilising our own land 
bank to grow our housebuilding operations 
and this growth will continue to optimise 
our revenue profile.
At Inland, sustainability is at the heart  
of everything we do. Ensuring sustainable 
operations and developments is of 
paramount importance, and our 
commitment to this ensures that we  
can continue as a successful business.

Land Portfolio
The land portfolio currently consists of 
6,936 plots with the vast majority in the 
South and South East of England. The size 
of the sites ranges from under 50 plots to 
over 1,350 plots. 
Inland is continuing to focus on acquiring  
a mix of brownfield sites, as well as strategic 
land, which is essentially greenfield land 
acquired with the knowledge that it could lead 
to a development opportunity at a later date. 
The strategic land we currently have in  
our land bank typically has a 2–5 year 
timeline for planning permission and 
has the potential for approximately 2,270 
residential plots across 408 acres. As a 
business, Inland is moving into a much 
larger average site size. 
We are also increasing the number of plots 
that we have within larger regeneration 
schemes. Whilst we have been involved in 
these projects for a little while now, we are 
looking to expand in this area to maximise 
the opportunities and value available. 
Alongside this, we are pushing to enhance 
the number of collaborative joint ventures 
with institutional landowners. Institutions 
such as the MOD, NHS and Local 
Authorities often have surplus land but  
not the skill set or commercial drivers  
that Inland Homes has. 
Whilst our core focus has always been, 
and will continue to be, acquiring and 
developing brownfield sites, we are 
establishing ourselves as a respected 
housebuilder in our own right. This allows 
us to take more control of our sites and 
ensure a higher build quality whilst 
maximising value generated for Inland.

OVERVIEW

Chairman’s Statement
Performance
Inland Homes has delivered another 
solid performance this year, on top of the 
significant investment that has been made 
into building the strength and expertise 
of our team, which has almost doubled in 
terms of headcount. We have recruited a 
considerable number of highly experienced 
individuals to create the right structure to 
support the future growth of the Company; 
in particular we have made further key 
appointments to the construction team 
as we move away from reliance on main 
contractors and develop this part of the 
business as an additional revenue stream.
The Group achieved a profit before tax 
and before revaluation of investment 
properties of £18.1 million (2016 restated*: 
£15.7 million) and a 4.3% increase in 
EPRA net asset value of £194.4 million 
(2016 restated*: £186.3 million). Including 
revaluation of investment properties, the 
profit before tax was £19.6 million (2016 
restated*: £33.7 million). This is lower than 
last year because of a revaluation uplift of 
£18.0 million in the previous year at Wilton 
Park, Beaconsfield, Buckinghamshire. We 
continue to make significant progress at 
our flagship site of over 100 acres at Wilton 
Park where a new information centre has 
now been completed. I am delighted to 
be able to report that an outline planning 
application has now been submitted for 
350 homes and commercial space on this 
prestigious site. The site is producing gross 
annual rental income of £1.5 million and is 
a good example of how we sweat our assets 
and ensure that we maximise every income 
opportunity from our land bank. In line 
with International Accounting Standard 23, 
which requires that the cost of borrowings 
attributable to an asset like Wilton Park, 
which must, by virtue of the complicated 
planning process and substantial time 
taken to get ready for its intended use,  
be capitalised with the other costs  
relating to the project. Accordingly, we  
have capitalised the relevant borrowing 
costs in relation to Wilton Park and have 
included current year funding costs of £1.09 
million within inventories (2016 restated*: 
£0.85 million) in the Group’s balance sheet.
Our confidence in delivering 
significant further growth 
for our shareholders 
is underpinned by the 
considerable shortage of 
new homes in the area and 
price point we operate in, 
as well as the quality of our 
land assets.”

During the year, the Group sold 188 private 
units (2016: 147 units) at an average price 
of £306,000 (2016: £337,000). Whilst the 
average sales price is lower than the 
previous year, this reflects the mix of units 
sold during the year in what remains an 
attractive price point within the geographic 
areas in which we operate. This is endorsed 
by a current forward order book of £33 
million (including forward sales within 
joint ventures) (2016: £22.5 million). We 
have a record number of 427 units under 
construction (including 43 within a joint 
venture) and are expecting this pipeline 
to increase over the next financial year 
as we develop more of our sites that 
come through the planning process. Our 
enhanced construction capability has 
enabled the Group to provide ‘turnkey’ 
delivery of homes to Housing Associations, 
usually where the land has been purchased 
from Inland Homes. This allows us to 
secure a further profit beyond the land 
sale together with the benefits of positive 
cash flows from the construction revenues. 
We have £41.5 million of such contracts in 
place with three Housing Associations and 
this is an area of the business where we see 
good growth potential.

The maturity of Inland’s borrowings has also been lengthened with 100% of total borrowings being payable after one year, of which 53.5% 
are repayable between three and five years. This has resulted in a significantly stronger maturity profile for the Group balance sheet with 
net current assets increasing to £159.9 million (2016 restated*: £96.7 million). The EPRA net asset value per share and the adjusted EPRA 
net asset value per share at 30 June 2017 was 91.88p (2016 restated*: 88.22p) and 96.22p (2016 restated*: 92.34p) respectively and has

Chairman’s Statement 
Continued
Land Portfolio
The land bank has increased over the 
previous year end following the disposal 
of 780 plots and 188 open market units. 
Our planning team has been extremely 
busy, having secured planning permissions 
for 1,856 plots during the financial year 
and a further 59 plots since the year end. 
A number of major sites within the land 
bank are proceeding through the planning 
process and I look forward to providing 
shareholders with positive news on these 
over the current financial year.
Our strategic land bank continues to grow, 
with options secured on sites with the 
potential for over 2,200 homes. Importantly, 
a number of these sites are now allocated 
into local plans and planning applications 
are being submitted. 
Dividend
In line with the Group’s strong performance 
and our progressive dividend policy, as 
well as our confidence in the outlook for 
the Company, I am pleased to inform 
shareholders that the Board is proposing 
a 33% increase in the final dividend to 1.2p 
per share (2016: 0.9p) subject to shareholder 
approval at the next Annual General Meeting 
to be held on 28 November 2017. Taking into 
account the interim dividend of 0.5p per 
share (2016: 0.4p) already declared and paid, 
this equates to total dividends of 1.7p per 
share (2016: 1.3p), a 31% increase.
Outlook
The housing market continues to be robust 
in the areas in which we operate and is 
underpinned by good demand from buyers 
and support from the Government’s Help to 
Buy scheme.
More moderate house price inflation should 
help maintain affordability in the near term 
and stabilising build cost inflation should 
underpin our margins as the benefits of 
our new direct build model start to filter 
through.
The planning system remains extremely 
slow and cumbersome with clearance 
of pre-start planning conditions being a 
major issue. Further, as widely reported 
by the rest of the housebuilding industry 
the ongoing shortage of skilled labour 
continues to be an area of concern.
Notwithstanding the above, the Board 
is confident that Inland Homes is well 
positioned to deliver strong operational  
and financial performance going forward.

Competitive landscape
Inland Homes has positioned itself typically 
at the first and second time buyer end of 
the housing market where demand is very 
strong and has been largely unaffected by 
recent changes in Stamp Duty Land Tax.
Our land bank is predominantly in the South 
and South East of England where demand 
for housing is the strongest. We promote 
substantial sites through the planning 
process and obtain planning consents that 
would suit housebuilders to commence on 
site shortly after acquiring it.
The demand for housing in our place of 
operation significantly outstrips supply 
and has resulted in house price inflation, 
although this has now slowed.
Key differentiators  
of Inland Homes
Inland Homes has a large and growing 
land bank of 6,936 plots, of which 2,137 
have planning consent or a resolution 
to grant planning consent. The land is 
predominantly in the South and South East 
of England where there is continued strong 
demand from private housebuilders and 
Registered Providers of affordable homes.
Inland Homes has a clear and agile 
business model giving us the flexibility 
to realise value in the land bank through 
consented plot sales, sales to Registered 
Providers, housebuilding or rental income 
from investment property.
Our highly experienced management 
and specialist development teams have 
worked together for a long time, enabling 
the successful identification, securing of 
suitable land and maximising each project’s 
potential. Our planning team, which has 
over 85 years combined experience, has 
a long track record of securing planning 
permissions across all our sites.

Growth in construction costs
The BCIS Private Housing Construction Price Index has 
shown that housebuilders have seen cost increases of 5% 
in the year to March 2017 with materials costs rising due to 
the devaluation of Sterling and labour costs rising due to an 
acute skill shortage. 
The shortage of skilled labour is widely acknowledged as 
the greatest constraint to increasing the UK housing supply 
other than the planning system and financial constraints, 
with 55% of the industry feeling the pressure. A recent survey 
for CIBSE by Hays showed that construction wages rose by 
3.5% in 2016, well ahead of the 1.8% UK average, although 
this represents a slow down from the 5% -6% seen in 2015. 
RICS are reporting that the shortage of bricklayers and 
quantity surveyors is particularly acute with plumbers and 
electricians not far behind.
Implications for Inland Homes
• Rising costs in relation to materials will impact on 
housebuilding profit margins and we have begun to buy 
materials directly from suppliers rather than via main 
contractors in order to ensure we are obtaining the best 
value as well as derive further savings by becoming a bulk 
purchaser.
• The skills shortage and resulting wage increases will 
also impact on the Group’s profit and we have therefore 
invested in our own housebuilding expertise as part of 
a deliberate strategy aimed at addressing the growth in 
construction costs as well as being part of an expansion 
programme.
Implications for Inland Homes
• Growing populations have an increased housing need 
which benefits both the Group’s land trading and 
housebuilding operations as well as its residential 
lettings.
• Low unemployment combined with low interest rates 
allow more people to access the housing ladder, which 
again benefits the Group’s entire business.
• House price increases directly affect the Group’s 
housebuilding operations but also drives up the value 
of consented land and is a result of the lack of supply, 
demonstrating the longer term demand for new housing.
UK economic/ 
macroeconomic conditions
Over the past 5 years the UK economy has steadily 
improved:
• We have seen a significant population growth
• Unemployment rates have dropped to 4.3% – the lowest 
since 1975
• Interest rates and inflation have remained very low
• House prices have continued to rise, albeit they have 
levelled off over the last year
However, the uncertainty over Brexit and the fall of sterling 
are causing growth to slow down, with the Bank of England 
slightly reducing its growth forecast for 2018 and indicating 
that interest rates could increase sooner than previously 
anticipated. Inflation rose sharply during the first half 
of 2017 and wage growth has been sluggish, squeezing 
household spending power.

Our Marketplace  
Continued
Demand for housing
There exists a structural imbalance in the housing market with excess demand over supply nationally and 
particularly in the South East. There is an estimated requirement of up to 275,000 homes per annum. Government 
policies may help to stabilise house price growth but it remains to be seen if they will increase supply significantly, 
leaving an expected shortfall of more than 100,000 homes per annum.
• Help to Buy – facilitates deposits as low as 5% 
through an equity loan scheme and represents 44% 
of Inland’s unit sales
• Help to Buy ISA – government contribution of up to 
25% of monthly cash savings (up to £50 per month)
• Lifetime ISA – 25% government contribution to 
savings (up to £4,000)
• Restrictions on pension savings by higher earners – 
lifetime allowance cut from £1.25 million to £1 million 
so buy to let provides an alternative investment 
option despite an increase in buy to let levies
• Starter homes – imposed 20% discount for first time 
buyers in exchange for reduced requirement for 
affordable housing
• Planning reform – focus on reducing the time 
planning applications spend with decision makers. A 
‘delivery test’ is being introduced to ensure delivery 
of local homes within a reasonable timeframe.
• Permitted conversion of offices to residential – 
permanent extension of permitted development 
rights from April 2016.
• Relaxation of building constraints on green belt land 
– permitted allocation of appropriate small-scale 
sites in the green belt specifically for Starter Homes, 
designed for young families.
• Government to provide £5 billion to stimulate 
housebuilding projects – £2 billion to accelerate 
construction of homes on publicly owned land, £1 
billion of short term loans to small housebuilders 
and £2 billion of long term funding for infrastructure 
to deliver up to 200,000 homes.
• Local Authority land release – unlocking large 
housing sites
• Government’s Housing White Paper – plans for 
‘presumption that brownfield land is suitable for 
development’, higher densities in urban locations 
with good transport links, better local plans, help 
for public sector landowners with remediation and 
infrastructure costs, larger Local Authority planning 
teams, removing unnecessary planning conditions, 
address skills shortage, reduce time taken for 
s106 and CIL agreements, encourage modern 
construction methods, Help to Buy to continue until 
at least 2021, £7bn affordable homes programme to 
build 225,000 affordable homes in this parliament.
Government initiatives – Demand
Supply
• This chronic undersupply underpins our sustainable 
business model for housebuilding, land trading and 
lettings operations.
• We ensure that we are aware of and in a position to 
take full advantage of Government initiatives which 
increase demand, such as Help to Buy.
• Similarly, we participate in initiatives to ease 
supply by purchasing office buildings to convert 
to residential; by taking part in the Government’s 
consultation on planning reform and being in 
constant dialogue with Local Authorities to ensure 
we are considered when large parcels of land are 
to be released for housing – this strategy led to our 
involvement with Southampton City Council on our 
Chapel Riverside project.

Our Agile Business Model
The strength in our Business Model lies in its agility. Our constant focus is to maintain a strong portfolio, but our decisions on how to 
proceed with a particular site, whether that be to continue to develop or to dispose of the land after obtaining planning permission, is 
something that we can reflect on by understanding the market conditions and our current requirements as a business. 
Land activity is the foundation of 
the Inland business model. 
Through identifying opportunities, 
selecting acquisitions, securing 
planning permission and 
purchasing strategic sites with 
future potential, Inland is able to 
expand its land portfolio.
In response to a changing 
marketplace, Inland Homes has 
been creating its own construction 
capabilities. 
By investing in our own people, we 
can ensure longer term, higher value 
returns for our shareholders. 
We sell some of our sites to Housing 
Associations and institutional 
landlords, with a construction 
contract for Inland Homes.
• Working with Local Authorities 
and communities to maximise 
the potential value of each site 
by securing a valuable planning 
permission.
• Allows us to capture the 
development margin in addition to 
the land uplift via planning.
• Developing the sites with our own 
team provides us with additional 
control over quality, costs and 
delivery.
• The construction contract 
accelerates revenue and provides 
monthly cash flow which assists 
the Group’s working capital or 
reduces our net borrowings. 
Developers: 
• Part or all of a site can be sold 
to developers: when selling 
part of a site to developers, they 
generally benefit from relevant 
infrastructure already having 
been installed by Inland Homes.
• We generally ensure 
that potential barriers to 
development are resolved and 
that the planning permission 
is for the right housing mix and 
development size to maximise 
the potential value of the site. 
Homeowners: 
• Part or all of the site can be 
developed by Inland Homes; we are 
proud of the developments we plan 
and design, and are always looking 
to create an environment that is 
attractive for future residents. 
Delivering on our commitment to 
quality and comfort, developed sites 
feature open spaces, play areas and 
attractive landscaping to suit the 
needs of a variety of people. 
Housing Associations and institutional 
landlords:
• Delivering high quality, reliable 
and attractive developments.

Our Agile Business Model
Our Value Chain
Our Value Chain outlines the various options available to Inland 
for generating value in the short, medium and long term.
In the short term we can generate value quickly through ensuring land obtains planning 
permission before being sold on, whilst medium-long term value can be made through the 
developing part, or all, of the site. 
Over the past year, we have increasingly entered into 
partnerships with Housing Associations as a way of 
delivering projects through the value chain.

Identify Land
Our local insight and established relationships

that we are aware of opportunities to increase 
our land bank.
Acquire Land
Our financing resources and strong reputation 
as being trustworthy and reliable mean that we 
can act quickly to secure promising sites. Sites 
acquired can often deliver short term returns.
This revenue can be generated from a number 
of sources, such as sale of surplus assets, 
rent from tenants, car parking and the sites 
being utilised as filming locations.
Achieve Planning Permission
Once a site is acquired, extensive research 
and stakeholder consultations take place 
to prepare our applications for planning 
permission. Our record of achieving planning 
permissions on sites is second to none.
INLAND HOMES ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 18 Stock code: INL 25624.01 – 11 October 2017 4:25 PM – Proof 2
The partnerships involve Inland Homes acquiring land 
and successfully taking it through the planning process 
before selling it on to the Housing Association. The 
Housing Association then employs Inland Homes as the 
construction contractor to develop the site in accordance 
with the planning consent. This provides the Housing 
Associations with exactly the outcome they require in a 
cost effective, timely and efficient manner.
In contrast to a traditional self delivered site, these 
partnerships provide Inland Homes with earlier revenue, 
profit and cash flow that also reduces the Group’s 
borrowing requirements.

Wilton Park, 
Beaconsfield
Photo and historical information credit:  
www.lostheritage.org.uk
20 Wilton Park is the former Ministry of Defence School 
of Languages site in a prime location to the East of 
Beaconsfield, Buckinghamshire. Having made a strategic 
purchase of adjacent land in 2012 Inland Homes was 
acknowledged as a special purchaser for this 100-acre 
development site.
A significant factor in enabling the wider Wilton Park redevelopment to take place is 
the need for a relief road around Beaconsfield. Local action groups and the community 
have been seeking this key piece of infrastructure for 25 years and Inland Homes has 
been able to generate the necessary momentum for the delivery for this road and have 
now secured planning permission for the first tranche of the Beaconsfield relief road to 
be built on our site. 
A planning application has recently been submitted for the wider redevelopment 
and prior to lodging this Inland Homes undertook a lengthy and extremely detailed 
consultation exercise to ensure that the requirements of numerous local stakeholders 
were met. Working closely with local residents, councillors, action groups and 
committee members, the planning application has sought to address the issues and 
concerns that have been raised which should greatly assist the planning process and 
timetable for an approval. 
Savills have described the Wilton Park site as ‘one of the finest development 
opportunities in Southern England’ and is steeped in history. Prior to 1968 the site had 
housed a three story Georgian Palladian Mansion constructed in 1779 as a substantial 
family home, however the role of the mansion changed, having been requisitioned by 
the War Office during World War II. 
From 1939 Wilton Park became an open political prison with over 4,000 ex-German 
soldiers spending time there as part of a process to rehabilitate former Nazi Officers 
and discuss the ideals of establishing a democratic Germany. 
Wilton Park then continued to be occupied by the army and latterly the Defence School 
of Languages when it was decided that a 16-storey tower block should be erected in 
place of the mansion house which was demolished in 1968. 
Inland Homes has spent several years evolving the master plan for Wilton Park and 
the proposals include the demolition of the unsightly tower block which is regarded 
by many as a local eye sore and to rebuild the Georgian Palladian Mansion to house 
luxury apartments and townhouses in its original location. The re-establishment of this 
important historical building has proven very popular with local residents and we look 
forward to seeing this particular part of the development take place. 
In total, this exemplar development will comprise 350 homes together with  
23,000 sq ft of commercial and community buildings offering local retail convenience 
facilities, community space and Air Training Corps facility, a children’s nursery and 
offices, the gross development value of which is expected to be approximately  
£350 million.

22 25624.01 – 11 October 2017 4:25 PM – Proof 2
During the Summer of 2016, Inland formed a 50/50 
joint venture in order to acquire the site of Tesco’s 
former headquarters in Cheshunt, Hertfordshire. A 
draft allocation emerged from the Local Authority 
for the wider Cheshunt Lakeside area and the joint 
venture has managed to control additional land with an 
allocation for a further 400-500 homes.
Over the following 12 months, Inland Homes has agreed development principals with 
the council to masterplan the entire site for approximately 2,000 homes and 153,000 
sq ft of commercial space along with a new primary school.
With a planning application expected to be submitted by the end of the calendar 
year, we are confident in securing an approval in 2018 with the intention of 
commencing the first phase of homes shortly thereafter. Whilst we currently control 
approximately 70% of the wider Cheshunt Lakeside area, the advantage of building 
the development in phases is that we can seek to acquire the areas of the site we do 
not own over the next few years. 
This new urban village will be the biggest project that Inland Homes has ever 
delivered and we expect the project to last about 8 to 9 years. The site itself runs 
along the Crossrail 2 line, which allows us to fulfil one of the Government’s pledges 
that there would be residential development along the corridors of Crossrail. 
Inland Homes has received significant support from the Local Authority to develop 
on this brownfield site. We have ensured that an appropriate density of residential 
could be achieved within the development, which has alleviated the need for the 
local council to find approximately 56 hectares of alternative land, which could only 
be facilitated through the release of sensitive greenbelt sites.

24 25624.01 – 11 October 2017 4:25 PM – Proof 2
The Alperton site is one of the early partnership 
developments for Inland Homes, with the Group entering 
into a construction contract with a major Housing 
Association, having disposed of the land. The contract is 
expected to conclude in approximately three years and is 
profitable, cash generative and self-funding. 
This project differs from an open market development project as the sale of the land 
happens immediately, crystallising the recognition of the land profit and generating 
a cash receipt which can be applied to reduce any associated borrowings. The 
client pays monthly valuations for work completed which enables early recognition 
of revenue and profit. This allows the development to proceed without the Group 
incurring additional borrowings and de-risks the development, providing a good 
counter balance to speculative housebuilding or lumpier land sales in terms of 
revenues, cash flow and return on capital employed.
The site is in an area that is suffering from a housing shortage and, sitting alongside 
the Grand Union Canal, the development itself will consist of attractive five storey 
units with excellent transport links to London. The site will be developed by our 
construction team which ensures we have the flexibility and guaranteed high quality 
that comes from an Inland home.

Our Strategy
Inland’s clear strategy has delivered growth and a number of outstanding 
projects over the last year. We have maintained existing relationships and 
developed new ones, and refined our housebuilding capabilities so that 
we continue to compete with other housebuilders. However, we have still 
retained the essence of what makes us unique.
Strategic goal Description Progress over past year Focus for the future Connected KPI
1
Increase the size of our land bank 
year on year
Purchases range from tactical acquisitions of sites which open up the potential of 
neighbouring land, to areas which will become key housebuilding terrain in the future, to 
sites ready for immediate development. All of these purchases are funded by our careful 
financial strategy, which balances loan finance, joint venture funding and equity released 
from operations.
• Increase in the size of the land 
bank since the last annual report

As our planning team adds value to land through securing planning permission, we are 
able to make attractive short term returns through land sales to developers. In this strong 
housebuilding climate there is high demand for quality land, so our strategy means that 
we are well poised to take advantage of this and generate strong revenue streams and 
cash flow to fund our land buying and development programme.

by Inland Homes to realise profits and to 
raise working capital. 
There was a strong demand for 
consented plots from housebuilders 
during the year so a substantial number

STRATEGIC 
REPORT 25624.01 – 11 October 2017 4:25 PM – Proof 2
Chief Executive’s Review
Our Group strategy continues to be focused 
on the following four strategic goals:
• Increasing the size of our strategic land 
bank, including brownfield sites where 
residential development is expected; the 
tactical acquisition of sites which unlock 
future potential; and locations which will 
become key housebuilding terrain in the 
future.
• Adding value to our land bank by 
navigating what are often complex sites 
through the planning system, requiring 
a unique skill set, and selling them to 
other developers, realising attractive 
short-term margins and generating cash 
to fund our operations.
• Maximising the value from our land bank 
through housing development and direct 
sales, as well as providing housebuilding 
services to other landowners.
• Ensuring a strong and flexible balance 
sheet by maintaining borrowings at a 
manageable level through a focus on 
cash management and with a maturity 
profile appropriate to our potential 
future cash flows.
With these in mind, it gives me great 
pleasure to report on another set of robust 
results for Inland Homes, demonstrating 
strong profitability during the year ended  
30 June 2017 and a further improvement  
in both stated and EPRA net asset value at 
the year end.
Results and operations
Profit before tax and before revaluation 
of investment properties has increased 
by 15.3% to £18.1 million (2016 restated*: 
£15.7 million) with the majority of 
realisations taking place in the second 
half of the financial year, as expected and 
previously guided. Including revaluation 
of investment properties, profit before tax 
was £19.6 million (2016 restated*: £33.7 
million) reflecting the majority of the 
valuation uplift having taken place in the 
previous year on the portfolio of existing 
residential properties at our site in Wilton 
Park, Beaconsfield. The EPRA net asset 
value at 30 June 2017 was £194.4 million 
(2016 restated*: £186.3 million) and this 
translated to 96.22p per share (2016 
restated*: 92.34p). 
We operate at the more affordable point 
in the market, where homes are typically 
priced between £200,000 to £450,000 and 
the average selling price of our homes 
during the financial year was £306,000 
(2016: £337,000). Our forward sales 
at 30 June 2017 stood at £19.9 million 
and currently stand at £33.0 million. In 
addition, we have three major construction 
contracts amounting to £41.5 million on our 
Partnership Housing activity, comprising 
permissioned land that has been sold to 
Housing Associations with Inland Homes 
subsequently securing construction 
contracts to build the planned residential 
units. The Group intends to increase this 
activity and expects this to be a growing 
revenue stream in the future.

The current annualised rental income from our commercial and residential investment activities, as we continually seek to maximise the 
potential of our assets, amounts to £2.6 million (2016: £2.6 million) and we will selectively sell some of these assets in order to reduce our 
net gearing.
Our development sites are principally around the M25 and M11 corridor, as well as on the South Coast around Poole in Dorset and 
Southampton in Hampshire. We believe these areas of the market, both in terms of pricing and location, will continue to remain relatively 
stable over the medium term, largely underpinned by the structural imbalance in the housing market which is continuing to witness 
excess demand over supply. 
Land Portfolio
The Group’s land bank currently stands at 6,936 plots (2016: 6,681 plots) with 30.8% (2016: 17.4%) of the portfolio having planning 
permission or a resolution to grant planning consent. During the year ended 30 June 2017 new planning approvals and resolutions to 
grant planning approval had been received for 1,856 residential units. The current status of the land portfolio is as follows:

This last financial year was an exceptional 
period that demonstrated the full 
capabilities of the business to deliver 
planning approvals on a considerable 
number of sites and across a wide range 
of diverse projects types with varying 
levels of complexity associated with 
them. To achieve this, Inland Homes 
has drawn on its extensive experience 
within the senior management team to 
manage the challenges of site delivery, to 
meet programme timetables and enable 
approvals that the Group can either take 
forward as future constructions sites,  
or as land available for sale.
The Group operates across a diverse land 
portfolio from town centre developments 
to major regeneration projects as well as 
some redevelopment of land located in the 
greenbelt. This requires land and planning 
teams with a unique skillset and expertise 
that sets us apart from our peers. Set out 
below some are of the projects that we have 
been working on during the last year.
Regeneration and  
Greenbelt / Greenfield 
Developments
Wilton Park, Beaconsfield 
An outline planning application for up to 
350 homes as well as commercial and 
community development on this major 
developed site in the greenbelt was 
submitted in September 2017. The design 
proposals have taken longer to come to 
fruition than originally anticipated as we 
needed to ensure that the scheme met the 
requirements of this premium location 
as well as those expected by the Local 
Authority. We are already generating an 
annual rental stream of £1.0 million from 
86 existing residential properties on this 
site valued at £46.9 million and which are 
included in the accompanying financial 
statements under investment properties. In 
addition, the site generates approximately 
£0.5 million per annum from letting other 
space for storage and film production. We 
expect this 100 acre site to generate a gross 
development value of approximately £350 
million. 
Wilton Park also sits within the proposed 
East of Beaconsfield Strategic Land 
release as proposed by South Bucks 
District Council and the current application 
ensures that it can accommodate further 
development on the site. 
Cheshunt Lakeside, Cheshunt
This is currently Inland Homes’ largest 
regeneration project comprising an 
emerging masterplan for a new mixed use 
Urban Village of up to 2,000 new homes 
on 30 acres of land of which 18 acres are 
either owned or controlled by our joint 
venture company. The site sits immediately 
adjacent to Cheshunt Station (27 minutes to 
London Liverpool Street) and the proposed 
new Crossrail 2 route. The setting is 
regarded by Broxbourne Borough Council 
as a key delivery location for much needed 
new homes and employment space in the 
Borough.  Over the last year our land and 
planning team have assisted the Local 
Authority in increasing the development 
allocation from 1,000 residential units to 
approximately 2,000 units across the wider 
masterplan. The Group has a 50% interest 
in this development site and a planning 
application is expected to be submitted in 
December 2017, once we have successfully 
incorporated the requirements of key 
stakeholders and have a masterplan 
that can support the Borough through 
their Local Plan process. The resultant 
masterplan will include new community 
facilities, a new two form entry primary 
school and employment space comprising 
uses such as offices, healthcare, business, 
leisure, restaurant and retail.

Continued
Chapel Riverside, Southampton
This regeneration site was secured by 
way of a Development Agreement with 
Southampton City Council whereby Inland 
Homes has obtained outline planning 
approval for 457 apartments plus 64,000 
sq ft of commercial space with a detailed 
approval for the first phase of 72 units, 
which is now under construction. The gross 
development value of this site is expected 
to be in excess of £120 million and we 
anticipate the project will take approximately 
seven years to complete.
Abbey Wharf, Alperton, London 
A resolution to grant planning consent was 
received for a first phase of 135 apartments 
in what is a new London Housing Zone. 
This site will kick start the regeneration 
and deliver some of the key requirements 
of the Housing Zone masterplan. The site 
was sold by the Group during the financial 
year generating a profit of £6.0 million. The 
Group has also secured a £29.5 million 
construction contract and construction is 
expected to commence in December 2017.
Aston Clinton Road, Aylesbury 
Significant technical and planning 
challenges, including noise, transport and 
drainage, had to be overcome by the Inland 
Homes team in order to secure planning 
consent for 400 homes and 105,000 sq ft of 
commercial space on this site, which was 
owned by our joint venture company with 
Europa Capital. The joint venture company 
was sold in June 2017 resulting in a gain for 
the Group of £7.0 million.
Town Centre Developments
Sherbourne Wharf, Birmingham
Located 500 metres from Brindleyplace in 
Birmingham, this well-located City Centre 
site has received planning approval for the 
first two phases, which will deliver a total of 
167 canalside apartments. We submitted a 
planning application for the third and final 
phase of 87 apartments in September 2017. 
This is a dense urban site which provides an 
exciting opportunity to create a new vibrant 
waterfront destination that links in with the 
Canal and Rivers Trust plans for the area. 
It has an expected gross development value 
of £50 million.
Beaumont Works, St Albans
When Inland Homes acquired this Grade 
II Listed Building it was severely run 
down and in need of refurbishment. 
Sensitive negotiations with conservation 
officers enabled a bespoke design 
to be incorporated alongside a new 
contemporary residential building with a 
total of 58 residential units. The site was 
sold with planning consent in June 2017 for 
£7.5 million and a profit of £1.8 million.
Randalls Department Store, Uxbridge
The Group’s expertise in the development 
of brownfield urban sites was put to the test 
on this former Grade II Listed Department 
store, a local landmark, which became the 
centrepiece of a new mixed use restaurant 
and residential proposal. Detailed negotiations 
with Historic England ensured that the final 
designs allowed for a practical design that 
retained the key aspects of the department 
store. Integration of affordable housing, 
technical aspects of structure and highways, 
plus the extra complication of the retention 
and conversion of the former fire station added 
to the complexities. Planning permission for 
58 apartments and 8,000 sq ft of commercial 
space was received with some accolade from 
the local Council. The Group expects the gross 
development value to be approximately £25 
million and plans to sell the site in the current 
financial year. 
Lily’s Walk, High Wycombe
Inland Homes secured planning permission 
for 239 new private tenure apartments 
and 15,800 sq ft of commercial space on 
this site in the heart of High Wycombe. 
As a former gas works with a significant 
sloping terrain, the site presented a range 
of challenges to be overcome. An integral 
part of this site is the delivery of a major 
piece of public infrastructure known as the 
Town Centre Relief Road that forms part 
of the new road system in the town. The 
Group will shortly commence construction 
of this development having purchased the 
site post year end from its joint venture with 
CPC Group Limited. The gross development 
value of the site is approximately £75 
million and contracts have already 
been exchanged with end purchasers of 
apartments for £5.5 million. 
Wessex Hotel, Bournemouth
This planning approval has been one of 
the hardest negotiated schemes the Group 
has procured. The location is on one of 
the major routes into Bournemouth and 
forms a key gateway within the West Cliff 
conservation Area. The scheme replaces 
an existing 100 bed, run down hotel, with a 
new 100 bed hotel, basement parking plus 
two apartment buildings totalling 88 private 
apartments.

Housebuilding 
Following the strategic decision to 
bring the majority of our housebuilding 
activity in-house, the past year has also 
focused on investing in the expansion 
of our construction team. This process 
has resulted in recruitment at both head 
office and site level and, as expected, this 
investment has brought about a planned 
increase in overheads, with staff numbers 
having increased from 39 on 1 July 2016 
to 74 at the year end. This facet of the 
business will deliver improved processes 
and structures that will accommodate an 
expansion in our production. Moreover, 
by managing this construction activity 
ourselves, we can deliver cost savings over 
the long term and enable greater control 
and certainty over the delivery and timing  
of projects. 
We currently have 427 units under 
construction (including 43 included within 
a joint venture) across 12 sites of which 316 
units (74%) are being delivered in-house. 
In order to control our working capital 
requirements, our policy has always been 
to forward sell our homes. This has been 
further bolstered by engaging in land 
disposals to potential landlords with forward 
funded construction contracts which will 
have a positive and growing impact on 
revenue, profits and net borrowings.
Outlook
We are continuing to see strong demand 
for sites within our land portfolio especially 
from Housing Associations who have been 
tasked by the government to increase the 
number of homes within their portfolios. 
The Group’s strategy is to use more of 
its land bank for its own housebuilding 
activities and procure planning permissions 
in order to deliver sites that could be 
either sold outright or with the benefit of a 
construction contract, or be developed to 
extract the development contribution. 
We believe that this provides Inland Homes 
with significant flexibility and balance to 
the business through diversified revenue 
streams and therefore, against the current 
market backdrop, feel very positive about 
our ability to create and crystallise further 
value for our shareholders.

Revenue by segment
Inland Homes has achieved another year 
of strong results, achieving growth in 
recurring profits before tax of 15.3% and in 
adjusted EPRA NAV per share of 4.2%. The 
Group’s strength in acquiring land well and 
successfully taking it through the planning 
process coupled with land disposals and 
housebuilding activity have all contributed 
towards producing these results. 
The business has five significant revenue 
streams as follows:
• Land disposals
• Sale of private homes
• Construction contracts
• Hotel income
• Rental and other income 
A commentary on these revenue streams is 
set out below.
Group Income Statement
Revenue for the year ended 30 June 2017 
was £90.7 million (2016: £101.9 million). This 
figure excludes two land sales which have 
been shown as a gain on sale of subsidiary 
or joint venture, rather than flowing 
through revenue and gross margin. If these 
transactions had been direct land sales, 
revenue would have been in the region of 
£117.7 million. 
The Group sold 780 residential plots (2016: 
425 plots) of which 400 plots were at a joint 
venture site in Aylesbury, Buckinghamshire 
and 173 plots related to our site in Alperton, 
Greater London which was a corporate 
disposal. The balance of 207 plots generated 
revenue of £22.4 million (2016: £43.3 
million).
Inland Homes legally completed 188 open 
market units (2016: 147) during the financial 
year, generating revenues of £57.8 million 
(2016: £51.5 million). The average selling 
price for a private unit was £306,000  
(2016: £337,000). 
During the latter part of the financial 
year the Group entered into three major 
construction contracts with Housing 
Associations on land sold by Inland 
Homes, for a total sum of £41.5 million. 
One of these contracts was in respect 
of 28 affordable homes to be provided 
under a s106 agreement on the last phase 
of our site at Queensgate, Farnborough 
where the land was sold for £1.9 million 
followed by a construction contract for £3.1 
million. In addition, the Group entered into 
construction contracts for a sum of £38.4 
million with two Housing Associations in 
respect of 192 private homes, the land for 
which was sold to them for a total sum 
of £24.1 million. The Group recognised 
revenues of £1.0 million under these 
contracts and will continue to recognise 
revenue under contract accounting on a 
percentage of completion basis throughout 
the construction programme. 
The term of the Group’s 
borrowing facilities has been 
improved with 100% of total 
borrowings being repayable 
after one year, and 53.5% 
repayable between three 
and five years.”

Looking forward, the Group intends to 
increase this type of activity which will 
result in an increased proportion of its 
revenue and corresponding profit to be 
recognised on a percentage of completion 
basis over the life of the development in 
comparison to recognition of revenue and 
profit on private unit completions at the 
point of legal completion. This activity will 
also enable the Group to realise revenue 
and profitability earlier by selling parcels 
of consented land, the proceeds from 
which will reduce net borrowings. The 
Group will also benefit from these forward 
funded construction contracts by providing 
additional development profits without 
the need to engage in development loans, 
related expenditure to procure funding 
and sales and marketing costs. A further 
advantage is that the Group will have a 
higher level of forward orders which will 
protect it against any potential future 
downturn in the housing market. As a 
result, the Group is prepared to accept a 
reduced net margin on such transactions.
Rental income increased to £2.4 million 
(2016: £2.1 million) with a significant 
increase in the corresponding operating 
profit of £2.1 million (2016: £1.7 million).  
The Group received revenues of £2.6 million 
(2016: £1.7 million) in operating the Wessex 
Hotel in Bournemouth where it has recently 
received planning consent for 88 residential 
units and a new 46,000 sq ft hotel with 
associated car parking facilities. Although 
the net contribution towards operating 
profit from this revenue stream is relatively 
small, it saves costs in respect of security, 
rates, insurance and maintenance whilst 
taking the site though the planning process.
Gross profit was £19.5 million (2016: £29.6 
million), however as explained above, two 
land sales were shown as gains on sale 
of subsidiary and joint venture where the 
profit was £13.0 million. The gross margin 
on housebuilding was 15.1% (2016: 21.9%). 
The reduction is due to an increase in 
unforeseen site wide costs on certain 
projects and additional remedial costs 
on certain historic projects. The gross 
margin from land disposals (including 
the sale of subsidiary and joint venture) 
was 38.7% (2016: 39.4%). Contract income 
showed a gross loss because the Group 
incurred significant remedial costs as well 
as liquidated ascertained damages on 
two construction contracts from Housing 
Associations that were sub contracted to a 
contractor that failed last year. Excluding 
these contracts, construction contract 
margin was 17.8%.
In line with the strategic decision to 
increase our in-house construction 
capabilities, our head count has increased 
from 39 to 74 over the course of one year. 
During the year, head office staff increased 
by 15 and consequently administrative 
expenses increased by 20.1% from  
£6.3 million to £7.6 million.
Our associate company, Troy Homes 
Limited, is in its second operating year and, 
as expected, further losses were incurred 
during the start-up phase. The Group has 
therefore made a provision of £238,000 
and the carrying value is now £1.1 million. 
Troy is expected to make a profit during its 
financial year ending 31 March 2018. 
Finance costs increased marginally by 
6.4% to £7.0 million (2016 restated*: 
£6.6 million). Actual interest charges on 
borrowings remained static at £4.7 million. 
This reflects the lower average cost of debt 
being incurred by the Group, especially 
when its borrowings have increased from 
£71.3 million to £94.5 million. Also included 
in finance costs is notional interest of 
£1.4 million (2016 restated*: £1.1 million) 
being the discount applied on deferred 
consideration on some of the Group’s land 
acquisitions and disposals. The Group has 
capitalised interest of £1.1 million (2016 
restated*: £0.8 million) within inventories 
as required by IAS 23. Interest cover, 
expressed as the ratio of operating profit 
(excluding revaluation gains) to net finance 
costs (excluding notional interest on 
deferred consideration) was 4.8 times  
(2016 restated*: 4.4 times).

The corporation tax rate is 19% and the 
small difference has arisen due to tax 
losses available for relief and a deferred 
tax liability on part of the revaluation gain 
on investment properties. A prior year 
adjustment of £1.3 million has been made 
to recognise an additional deferred tax 
liability relating to the revaluation gains 
on investment properties due to sufficient 
capital losses not being available. See note 
29 for further information.
Earnings Per Share  
and Dividends
Basic earnings per share decreased by 
44.2% to 7.82p (2016 restated*: 14.01p) 
per share while basic earnings per share 
excluding revaluation gains increased by 
39.3% to 7.09p (2016 restated*: 5.09p). The 
Company paid an interim dividend of 0.5p 
(2016: 0.4p) per share on 23 June 2017 
and the Board has recommended a final 
dividend of 1.2p (2016: 0.9p) per share, 
increasing the total dividend for the year by 
30.7% to 1.7p (2016: 1.3p) per share which 
delivers a yield of approximately 2.8% 
based on the share price at 30 June 2017. 
The proposed final dividend will be payable 
on 26 January 2018 subject to shareholders’ 
approval, to shareholders on the register at 
the close of business on 29 December 2017.
Group Balance Sheet  
and Financial Position
Net assets at 30 June 2017 were £130.6 
million, an increase of 12.2% mainly due 
to retained earnings and a small issue of 
new shares to employees as a result of 
exercising share options. This translates 
to net assets of 64.62p per share (2016 
restated*: 57.66p). The EPRA net asset 
value per share at 30 June 2017 was 91.88p 
(2016 restated*: 88.22p) and the adjusted 
EPRA net asset value was 96.22p (2016 
restated*: 92.34p) per share.
The Group has provided a loan facility to 
its associate, Troy Homes Limited, of £3.1 
million which bears a coupon of 8% per 
annum and expires on 9 October 2020. As 
at the year end Troy had drawn down £2.9 
million of this facility. 
Inventories have reduced in line with the 
sale of residential units and plots during 
the year as there were no significant 
land purchases during the financial year. 
The design proposals at Wilton Park in 
Beaconsfield have taken longer than 
originally anticipated in order to make sure 
that the scheme met the requirements 
of this prominent site and that of the 
Local Authority. Therefore, in line with 
International Accounting Standard 23, 
the Group has decided to capitalise the 
borrowing costs in relation to this project 
and has included £1.1 million within 
inventories. Accordingly, a prior year 
adjustment for £1.6 million was made 
against inventories and reserves brought 
forward.

The term of the Group’s borrowing facilities 
has been improved with 100% of total 
borrowings being repayable after one year, 
and 53.5% repayable between three and 
five years. Our development activities are 
financed using a £20.0 million committed 
revolving credit facility expiring in the 
Autumn of 2019 and land purchases have 
the benefit of a £25.0 million committed 
revolving credit facility expiring in over 
three years. We have also procured a 
£43.3 million term facility secured against 
the existing residential units and land at 
our site in Wilton Park, Beaconsfield. In 
addition, the Group has the Zero Dividend 
Preference Shares which have an accrued 
liability of £17.3 million and are repayable 
on 10 April 2019. The cash balance at the 
year end amounted to £26.5 million (2016: 
£16.7 million) and net borrowings (loans 
and ZDP liability less cash) were £68.0 
million (2016 restated*: £54.6 million) 
representing net gearing of 52.1% (2016 
restated*: 46.9%) on net assets of £130.6 
million (2016 restated*: £116.3 million) or 
35.0% on EPRA net assets of £194.4 million 
(2016 restated*: £186.3 million). Net gearing 
is defined as loans and accrued ZDP liability 
less cash as a proportion of either net asset 
value or EPRA net asset value.

Risk Management
Risk management framework
Exit of the United 
Kingdom from the 
European Union
On 23 June 2016, the United Kingdom 
had a referendum in which the public 
voted to leave the European Union.
Potential impact
There is still uncertainty within the 
UK economy and it is too early to 
confirm the impact of the departure. 
However, the long term underlying 
demand for new homes is very strong 
and the government has stated that it 
will be supporting the housing market 
with relevant initiatives.
The Executive Directors are heavily involved 
in the day-to-day running of the business. 
Risks are discussed on a daily basis as 
part of decision making on projects. This 
regular consideration of risks allows 
management to respond quickly to changes 
in circumstances. 
The Executive Directors set criteria in a 
range of areas for the Senior Management 
to report back on: legal, sales and 
marketing, planning, environmental, 
construction and financial. Senior 
Management carry out their due diligence 
on these aspects for each site. This 
frequently involves the engagement of 
external consultants, such as planning 
consultants, who use their specialist 
knowledge and outside perspective to 
challenge our assumptions and ensure 
that we have a full understanding of the 
site and its market. From assessing all 
the information in the reports from Senior 
Management, Executive Directors can 
determine the risks present for each site, 
which informs their decision-making.
While the Executive Directors have some 
autonomy, full Board approval is required 
for certain actions, such as the acquisition 
of land over a set value. The Non-Executive 
Directors challenge the Executive Directors 
to ensure that the level of risk being taken 
is appropriate. 
The Audit Committee support the Board 
in ensuring that the financial performance 
of the Group is properly reported and 
monitored. The Audit Committee work 
closely with external auditors to do this. 
The auditors produce reports on the control 
environment and financial statements, 
which are reviewed by the Audit Committee.

to customers and this includes assistance with 
obtaining mortgages at a suitable interest rate
Environmental
Unexpected contamination being 
found on a site
Unexpected liabilities in respect of 
decontamination works or fines for

Sustainability
SUSTAINABILITY
AT THE HEART OF 
EVERYTHING WE DO
Our key values of integrity, openness and trust dictate 
our interactions with each of our major stakeholder 
groups:
• communities
• homeowners
• developers
• colleagues
• local and national government
• the environment
The value we place on meeting the needs of each of 
our stakeholder groups intuitively informs all of our 
policies. With sustainability at the heart of everything 
we do, the following six areas describe our main 
focuses, and include many of our achievements.
At Inland, ensuring sustainable operations and development is 
of paramount importance. Our caring attitude to our colleagues, 
partners and the communities and environments in which we work 
means we strive to function in a way that is best for everyone.

Community
Caring for the wider community permeates 
all our activities, and our core focus of 
transforming potentially contaminated land 
into desirable family homes and community 
spaces is always undertaken with the needs 
of future residents and neighbours firmly  
in mind. We put a significant amount of  
effort into ensuring that a development  
looks attractive through hard and soft 
landscaping of the site.
At Inland, we support a number of charities 
and community organisations, including:
BIBIC
Inland are supporters of The British 
Institute of Brain Injured Children (BIBIC) 
who are a national charity offering practical 
help to families caring for children with 
conditions like autism, Asperger’s, cerebral 
palsy, Down’s syndrome, developmental 
delay, brain injury, and specific learning 
difficulties like ADHD, dyslexia and 
dyspraxia.
Make-A-Wish
Inland makes regular donations to the 
Make-A-Wish Foundation and attends  
their fundraising events. This charity  
tries to make wishes of children and young 
people fighting life-threatening, sometimes 
terminal illnesses, come true.
Beaconsfield Cricket Club
We are delighted to be the main sponsor 
of Beaconsfield Cricket Club, whose first 
team play in Division 1 of the Thames Valley 
League.
Basildon Football Club
We are currently sponsors of Basildon 
Football Club.
Colour Rush
This year we have raised over £7,000 for 
these charities:
• HCPT Group 170 
• Teens Unite Fighting Cancer 
• Dennis Wise & Frankham Group 
Charitable Trust 
Last year we completed the 5k Colour 
Obstacle Rush, raising over £8,000  
each for:
• forCrohns
• The Nephrotic Syndrome Trust
• Sightsavers
London Taxi Driver’s Fund for 
Underprivileged Children
We donated £3,000 to pay for their taxi 
safari around Woburn Safari Park.
National Autistic Society
2 senior members of staff ran the London 
Marathon and raised over £22,000.

The following use the site for training 
regularly free of charge:
• Thames Valley Police firearms training
• Thames Valley Police dog training 
• Metropolitan Police dog training 
• National training support group  
(prison service)
• Buckinghamshire Police Fire and Rescue

Customers
Ensuring customers have a positive 
experience throughout their interaction 
with us increases the likelihood of recurring 
project partnerships with developers, and 
repeat custom or recommendations from 
homeowners. Our strong reputation for 
quality, reliability and delivery leads to many 
opportunities, for example, land vendors trust 
Inland to honour promises and offer sales 
opportunities, while council and community 
groups seriously consider our bids knowing we 
have the capability to transform difficult sites.
Our Customer Service procedure ensures 
that in the unlikely event a customer is 
dissatisfied for whatever reason, we are able 
to quickly respond and deal with the issue.

Sustainability  
Continued
Our process means that whether the 
development is self-delivery or contractor 
led, we can ensure that the issue or 
enquiry is forwarded directly to the correct 
personnel where it will be acknowledged 
and the matter progressed to resolution.
There is a dedicated Customer Service 
mailbox for each development which 
enables the Customer Service team to 
log all reported issues and enquiries on 
dedicated trackers to ensure that the issues 
are monitored from receipt to completion 
and that the customer remains informed.
The Customer Service Managers will attend 
face-to-face meetings with customers, 
where appropriate, to discuss and inspect 
reported issues first hand and make 
immediate determinations as to the 
resolution required.
Our small and professional team will seek 
to resolve all customer issues with empathy 
and expediency.
The principles of lifetime homes are 
incorporated into all of our developments, 
which means that our homes are designed 
to be easily adaptable for lifetime use 
at minimal cost. The relationship with 
homeowners also continues after the sale of 
a house, with close monitoring and support 
provided, and customer feedback used to 
improve future projects. Customer feedback 
has been used to improve the design of our 
homes, with the layout of certain rooms (for 
example the bathroom) changing to better 
suit the needs of our customers.
Health and Safety
In previous years we have relied on Health 
and Safety consultants to ensure that our 
sites are safe, reporting any problems they 
have back to us. Whilst this has always 
ensured we are fully compliant with Health 
and Safety regulations, as we are growing 
in the number of self-delivery projects we 
undertake, we felt it was important that we 
expand our Health and Safety remit. We 
have therefore directly appointed a new 
Head of Health & Safety to manage this 
key part of the business and ensure that 
standards and culture are of a high level.
We have been joined by key individuals 
whose experience, coupled with the 
development knowledge of current Inland 
Homes employees, ensures that we can 
begin to make improvements to this area. 
We recognise that for these improvements 
to be sustainable we must ensure that the 
culture and behaviours we expect on our 
sites are consistently communicated. 
Earlier in the year a Steering Group of 10, 
including three directors, was set up to 
share experiences of Health and Safety and 
decide which areas were a priority to tackle, 
with information and suggestions being 
peer reviewed. Important elements such as 
pedestrian access, document control and 
site signage have been addressed ensuring 
that each Inland Homes development has 
Construction underway on Phase 2 of Meridian, Southampton, Hampshire
a consistent look and feel. The Group will 
meet regularly to review performance and 
embrace continual improvement.
In the coming year we will focus on working 
with our Supply Chain to ensure that their 
standards meet our expectations. Initiatives 
in the pipeline include behavioural training, 
awareness campaigns, initiative weeks 
and minimum training expectations and we 
expect to see the benefits of engagement 
with the Supply Chain across the business.
The benefits that improving our Health 
and Safety can bring extends beyond the 
physical safety of our employees. Ensuring 
good practices encourages others to work 
with us, improves the quality of the work 
produced on site and assists with raising 
our risk profile to insurers, helping the 
business to be successful and profitable.
Supply Chain
As we have continued to successfully move 
into self-delivery of projects, we have 
reduced the number of main contractors 
who build the whole sites. With seven self-
delivered sites we now have a much larger 
supply chain of individual trades and whilst 
last year our focus was on acquiring these 
partnerships, this year we will focus on 
building these relationships. 
One way in which we will achieve this is by 
hosting Inland Homes’ first Supply Chain 
Conference in November 2017. Attendees will 
include current sub-contractors who work for 
Inland along with those who may wish to work 
for us in the future. Outlining what Inland 
Homes does, our culture and our ethos and 
what projects we have in the upcoming year 
will help us to solidify existing relationships 
and help form new ones. 
The relationships between Inland Homes 
and our subcontractors are based on 
partnerships as opposed to a one sided 
arrangement. We are keen to support 
our regional supply chain, appreciating 
the differences in the way people work 
and offering flexibility with those where 
appropriate. For example, there might be 
a situation where a subcontractor pays 
their staff weekly, so we are able to offer 
fortnightly payments.

Supporting and encouraging our supply 
chain is very important to us, and we 
actively encourage apprenticeships within 
the business. We have recently employed 
two apprentice site managers and, in time, 
we will be expanding this to employing 
apprentices for trades and placing them with 
our subcontractors to be trained. It is vital 
that we continue to support the development 
of apprentices and new starters to ensure 
that the supply chain remains sustainable. 
Last year we reported that some of our 
principal contractors had won awards at 
the LABC Bricks awards. This year we are 
pleased to announce that Inland’s first self-
delivery site Meridian Waterside has won a 
regional LABC Bricks Development of the 
Year with us going through to the national 
awards in October 2017. 
Sustainable Homes
Planning the sustainability of developments 
begins at the earliest stages of a project, 
when potential sites are assessed — for 
example, considering what materials are 
present on the site and if these could be 
reused in construction. Throughout the 
planning of the infrastructure, buildings, 
and construction strategies, sustainability 
is a core focus, and decisions are taken 
which make both financial and ecological 
sense. On larger projects we have the 
scope to undertake ambitious sustainability 
projects, such as installing energy centres, 
and all of our projects use a range of 
environmentally friendly materials and 
construction methods.
As we now predominantly self-deliver our 
sites, we have gained greater control over 
developments. At all of our self-delivery 
sites, we avoid using mixed use skips 
so that we can segregate waste. This 
means that it is easier for the waste to be 
recycled, reducing the amount that goes to 
landfill. We are trying to reduce our carbon 
dioxide emissions through a number of 
initiatives, such as having eco-friendly site 
accommodation and ensuring that we are 
always using electricity from the main grid 
supply, rather than using a generator.
Our People
We have always prided ourselves on our 
supporting and caring culture. As we 
grow as a Group, and more employees 
are working on various sites, we feel it is 
important to communicate this culture 
across the business, regardless of 
geographic location. 
The warmth of atmosphere and pride 
individuals take in working for Inland 
Homes is what encourages people to stay 
with us and ensure that our team remains 
strong into the future.
As Inland Homes has grown over the last 18 
months, our team has developed from 28 to 
90 members of staff, with around 55 on site. 
A challenge with this growth is ensuring 
that Inland’s culture is communicated 
effectively both within our offices and on 
our sites. We are facing this challenge 
through investing in elements such as a 
staff intranet to ensure that no-one feels 
isolated whilst working at Inland Homes.
Bringing new talent into the company is 
hugely important, as there is a general 
shortage of labour across all roles within 
the property industry. We are passionate 
about developing the next generation of 
workers, whether they be in our offices or 
working with our subcontractors on site. 
We hire both graduates and apprentices 
and offer work experience to students 
where there is a potential  
of a permanent role at the end.
Along with hiring new talent, we are 
dedicated to developing the skills of our 
existing employees. This may be through 
offering them responsibility, having the 
opportunity to learn from others within the 
Group and through supporting them to do 
external qualifications.

I joined Inland Homes shortly after completing a masters degree in Spatial Regeneration 
at Queen’s University Belfast and have worked here for four years. I originally joined as 
an Assistant Planner, and I was then promoted to the role of Planner. I am now a Planning 
Manager within the Inland Planning and Design department. 
With the financial support of Inland Homes, two years ago I became a member of the 
Royal Town Planning Institute (RTPI) and I am now working towards becoming a Chartered 
Planner, a qualification that I would like to achieve by the end of 2018. The support I have 
received from Inland Homes has been vital to my development. Along with practical 
experience, the Group has supported and encouraged me to attend planning seminars 
and conferences which has been hugely beneficial to my professional development whilst 
ensuring I keep abreast of changes to planning policies and regulations which I can then 
apply to my work. Gaining formal recognition of the experience and skills I have acquired 
through becoming a Chartered Planner will be hugely advantageous to my personal 
development but will also aid in continuing to create a strong and skilled team within the 
Inland Planning and Design department. 
The experience I have gained since working at Inland Homes has been amazing, having 
received responsibility and ownership of projects early on in my career. Whilst the 
business has grown considerably over the last 18 months, the consistent leadership has 
been hugely beneficial and the ability to have direct communication with the Leadership 
team is a special characteristic of Inland Homes.

Board of Directors
Board Composition
The Group is managed through its Board 
of Directors. The Board comprises the 
Non-Executive Chairman, one other Non-
Executive Director, the Chief Executive, 
Group Finance Director and the Land 
Director. The Board’s main roles are to 
approve and review the Group’s strategic 
objectives and to ensure that the necessary 
financial and other resources are made 
available to enable it to meet these 
objectives.
Specific responsibilities reserved to the 
Board include: setting Group strategy; 
reviewing operational and financial 
performance; approving certain land 
acquisitions; approving appointments to 
the Board; and approving policies relating 
to Directors’ remuneration. In addition, the 
Board reviews the risk profile of the Group 
and ensures that an adequate system of 
internal control is in place.
The roles of the Chairman and the Chief 
Executive are separate. The Chairman 
meets the Chief Executive and the other 
Non-Executive Director separately as and 
when required to discuss matters of the

Employee involvement
The Group places considerable value  
on the involvement of its employees and 
keeps them informed of all relevant  
matters on a regular basis. The Group  
is an equal opportunities employer and  
all applications for employment are 
considered fully on the basis of suitability 
for the job.
Corporate governance
Whilst the Company does not comply with 
the 2014 Corporate Governance Code for 
periods beginning after 1 October 2014, 
the Directors recognise the importance 
of sound corporate governance and have 
reported on our Corporate Governance 
arrangements by drawing upon best 
practice available, including those aspects 
of the UK Corporate Governance Code 2014 
we consider to be relevant to the Company 
and best practice.
Audit Committee
The Audit Committee comprises Terry 
Roydon (Chairman) and Simon Bennett. 
The Audit Committee meets at least 
four times a year and is responsible for 
ensuring that the financial performance 
of the Group is properly reported and 
monitored and for meeting the auditor and 
reviewing their reports in relation to the 
financial statements and internal control 
systems. The Group’s auditor provides 
some non-audit services, but these are not 
considered to threaten their independence. 
The committee reviews the level of non-
audit fees on an annual basis. The Audit 
Committee meetings are also attended by 
invitation by representatives of the Group’s 
auditor, the Group Finance Director and the 
Chief Executive.
Since 30 June 2016 the Audit Committee 
has met three times to consider the 
planning of the statutory audit and to  
review the Group’s draft half and full year 
results prior to Board approval and to 
consider the external auditor’s detailed 
reports thereon.
Internal controls
The Board is responsible for maintaining 
a sound system of internal control to 
safeguard shareholders’ investment and 
the Group’s assets and for reviewing its 
effectiveness. Such a system is designed 
to manage, but not eliminate, the risk of 
failure to achieve business objectives. 
There are inherent limitations in any 
control system and accordingly even the 
most effective system can provide only 
reasonable, not absolute, assurance 
against material misstatement or loss.
The Board reviews the effectiveness of the 
Group’s system of internal control on an 
ongoing basis. Annual budgets are prepared 
and detailed management reports are 
presented to the Board and used to monitor 
financial performance and compliance with 
the Group’s policies and procedures. All 
controls are covered including financial  
and operational controls to manage risk.  
The Board meetings are also used to 
consider the Group’s major risks.
Relations with shareholders
The Company has institutional 
shareholders and is, where practicable, 
willing to enter into a dialogue with them. 
The Chief Executive and Group Finance 
Director meet with institutional investors 
within the confines of relevant legislation 
and guidance.
The Board invites communication from 
its private investors and encourages 
participation by them at the AGM. All  
Board members are present at the AGM 
and are available to answer questions  
from shareholders.
Internal audit
The Board reviews from time to time the 
need for an internal audit function and 
remains of the opinion that the systems of 
internal financial control are appropriate to 
the Group’s present activities and that such 
a function is unnecessary.
Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee comprises 
Simon Bennett (Chairman) and Terry 
Roydon. The principal functions of 
the committee are to determine the 
Group’s policy on the remuneration of 
Executive Directors and to determine the 
remuneration package of each Executive 
Director. The committee also determines 
long term incentive plans and the allocation 
of share options to the Executive Directors 
and other employees. The Remuneration 
Committee meetings are also attended by 
invitation by the Chief Executive and the 
Group Finance Director. During the year  
the committee met a number of times 
to review the Executive Directors’ 
remuneration package.
The Directors comply with Rule 21 of the 
AIM Rules relating to Directors’ dealings 
and take all reasonable steps to ensure 
compliance by the Company’s applicable 
employees. The Company has adopted  
and operates a share dealing code for 
Directors and employees in accordance 
with the AIM Rules.

Directors’ Remuneration Report 
(unaudited)
There is no requirement for companies 
quoted on AIM to produce a formal 
Remuneration Report. As a consequence, 
this Remuneration Report is produced 
for information purposes in order to give 
shareholders and other users of the 
financial statements greater transparency 
about the way in which the Directors of 
Inland Homes are remunerated.
This report sets out the remuneration  
paid to the Directors for the year ended  
30 June 2017 and sets out the remuneration 
policy for the forthcoming financial year 
and beyond.
Composition and role of the 
Remuneration Committee 
The Board have established a 
Remuneration Committee which currently 
consists of Simon Bennett, independent 
Non-Executive Director, who is Chairman 
of the committee and Terry Roydon, the 
Company’s Non-Executive Chairman. The 
role of the Remuneration Committee is 
to determine the specific remuneration 
package for each of the Executive Directors 
and no Director is involved in any decisions 
that will affect his own remuneration. The 
Remuneration Committee has access to 
information provided by the three Executive 
Directors of Inland Homes, namely Stephen 
Wicks, Chief Executive, Nishith Malde, 
Group Finance Director and Paul Brett, 
Land Director and independent advice from 
external consultants, where it considers 
this to be appropriate.
The Remuneration Committee meets 
formally three times a year and on such 
other occasions as may be required.
Policy for Executive 
Directors’ remuneration
The policy for Executive Directors’ 
remuneration is designed to attract, 
motivate and retain high calibre individuals 
with a competitive remuneration package. 
The remuneration policy takes into account 
the overall performance of the Company 
and the individual Executive Directors and 
the prevailing pay structures in the markets 
in which Inland Homes operates.
The Executive Directors’ remuneration 
is designed to provide a balance between 
fixed and variable rewards, although it 
is recognised that it is common industry 
practice for total remuneration to 
be significantly influenced by annual 
bonuses and long term incentive plans. 
Consequently, remuneration packages for 
individual Executive Directors comprise a 
basic salary, deferred bonus plan, a long 
term incentive plan and benefits in kind. 
In agreeing the basic salary and annual 
bonuses, in addition to the factors outlined 
above, the Remuneration Committee takes 
into account the aggregate remuneration to 
be received by the individual Executive. 
In 2013, in line with best corporate 
governance and market practice, the 
Remuneration Committee introduced a 
new deferred bonus plan and a long term 
incentive plan for the Company’s Executive 
Directors, which have been designed to 
incentivise the Executive Directors to 
grow the business and maximise returns 
to shareholders. The latter is known as 
The Inland Homes plc 2013 Growth Plan 
(“2013 LTIP”), which will operate for a 
period of six years and which was approved 
by shareholders in general meeting in 
December 2013. The key elements of the 
scheme are set out below.
Basic salary
The basic salaries of the Executive 
Directors are reviewed on an annual basis. 
The Remuneration Committee seeks to 
establish a basic salary for each position 
commensurate with the individual’s 
responsibilities and performance, taking 
into account comparable salaries for 
similar companies of a similar size in the 
same market.
Deferred Bonus Plan 
The Deferred Bonus Plan came into effect 
on 1 July 2013. Executive Directors can 
earn up to 100% of basic annual salary 
as an annual bonus. The plan provides 
for 50% of an Executive Director’s bonus 
to be mandatorily deferred into ordinary 
shares in the Company. Under these 
arrangements, bonuses would be based 
on a percentage of the individual Executive 
Director’s base salary as follows: 
• 50% of salary for “on target” 
performance; and 
• a further 50% of salary for “out-
performance”. 
For example, for achieving 90% of on target 
performance there will be a discretionary 
bonus of up to 25% of salary (and pro-
rata between 90% and 100% of on target 
performance) and there will be no bonus for 
less than 90% of on target performance. 
The target is measured by reference to two 
equally weighted performance measures, 
namely: 
• profit before taxation as compared with 
brokers’ market forecasts following the 
announcement of the preliminary results 
of the previous accounting period; and 
• net debt levels. 
Once the quantum of the Executive 
Directors’ bonuses has been calculated, 
these will be settled as to 50% in cash and 
as to 50% by the issue of ordinary shares 
of the Company. The issue of any ordinary 
shares awarded under the Deferred Bonus 
Plan will be deferred for three years and 
will be subject to forfeiture in the event that 
an Executive leaves the Company as a “bad 
leaver”, but would not be subject to further 
performance conditions. 
Long Term Incentive Plans
The Company operates both an unapproved 
share option scheme, which is open to all 
employees of Inland Homes and the 2013 
LTIP for the Executive Directors.
Awards under the unapproved share option 
scheme are made on a periodic basis to 
the Company’s Executive Directors and 
employees. The share options in this 
scheme vest three years after the date of 
grant and have an exercise period of seven 
years. The schemes are equity-settled.
The following is a summary of the principal 
features and terms of the 2013 LTIP: 
1. Creation of Growth Shares 
The plan operates by reference to rights 
attached to a special class of share in a 
newly established intermediate holding 
company (Inland Homes 2013 Limited) 
between the Company and the Group’s 
trading subsidiaries. The special class of 
shares are called “Growth Shares”. The 
Growth Shares are qualifying shares for 
the purposes of the Employee Shareholder 
Status scheme, a recently introduced 
proposal by the Government, the aim 
of which is to provide tax benefits to 
employees and Directors who achieve 
growth for their employing companies.
INLAND HOMES ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 54 Stock code: INL 25624.01 – 11 October 2017 4:25 PM – Proof 2
The awards in relation to the Growth 
Shares will be subject to performance 
targets (“Performance Targets”) and when 
such Performance Targets are achieved, a 
relevant proportion of the Growth Shares 
will be awarded. 
2. Vesting and Exchange  
of Growth Shares 
Subject to the Performance Targets being 
met, the awards in relation to the Growth 
Shares will vest in accordance with the 
Articles of Association of Inland Homes 
2013 Limited if and when each Performance 
Target is met. After vesting, the Growth 
Shares may be realised by being exchanged 
for a fixed number of the Company’s 
ordinary shares. 
The Growth Shares will not carry any 
entitlement to dividends, capital or 
voting unless and until they vest and are 
exchanged for shares in the Company. 
3. Performance Targets 
Vesting will only occur if specific 
Performance Targets (which are linked to 
the share price of Inland Homes plc over 
six consecutive performance periods) are 
met or exceeded for 15 working days in the 
relevant performance period. Each annual 
performance period ends 20 working days 
after the announcement of preliminary 
results for each year, usually therefore in 
October of each year.
The target share prices for the 2013 
LTIP are based on compounded growth 
being achieved and accordingly, if the 
Performance Target is missed in one 
period, the participants’ awards can still 
vest if the required compound percentage 
of growth is achieved in subsequent 
periods. For instance, if in the first period 
the Performance Target for that period is 
not met, then the related number of Growth 
Shares which could have vested may still 
vest in the following period or periods, 
provided that the Performance Target for 
those periods is achieved, as the target gets 
increasingly more stretching. 
The first Performance Target has been set 
at a price of 60.5 pence per ordinary share 
(the “First Target Performance Price”), 
which has been set at a 30% premium to 
the share price of 46.5 pence per ordinary 
share (the “Initial Base Price”), being the 
mid price at the close of business on  
20 December 2013, the date 2013 LTIP  
was adopted. 
The table below shows the accounting 
periods and the total number of ordinary 
shares in the Company that would be 
issuable on exchange for vested Growth 
Shares assuming the Performance Target 
for each year of the respective years is 
achieved:

4. Dilution 
The total number of shares in the Company 
which may become issuable on the 
exchange of Growth Shares (assuming 
vesting in full) is 11,350,504, equivalent to 
5.6% of the current issued share capital of 
the Company. In order for the maximum of 
11,350,504 ordinary shares in the Company 
to become issuable under the 2013 LTIP, 
the price for each Inland Homes ordinary 
share, in the absence of a takeover, will 
have had to have more than doubled 
before the end of the final performance 
period (being 20 working days after the 
announcement of the preliminary results 
for the year ending 30 June 2019), when 
compared with the Initial Base Price of 46.5 
pence per ordinary share. This increase is 
approximately equivalent to a 14% annual 
compound rise in the ordinary share price. 
5. Change of Control 
The 2013 LTIP will allow realisation from 
three years after the award, provided the 
Performance Targets have been met. As 
is customary, the 2013 LTIP does provide 
for early vesting of Growth Shares in the 
event of a takeover of Inland Homes before 
the expiry of the plan, such that all the 
Growth Shares will vest, provided that the 
offer price is greater than the share price 
required to achieve the Performance Target 
for the relevant performance period in 
which the takeover occurs. 
6. Participants 
The Executive Directors who will participate 
in the 2013 LTIP and their allocations of 
Growth Shares, is as follows: Stephen 
Wicks 47%, Nishith Malde 38% and Paul 
Brett 15%. In addition, any awards to the 
Executive Directors under the 2013 LTIP are 
subject to good and bad leaver provisions. 
Other benefits
Depending on the exact terms of each 
individual Executive Director’s service 
contract with the Company, they are 
entitled to a range of benefits including 
either a car allowance or a fully expensed 
company car, contributions to pension 
schemes, private fuel, private health care 
insurance, permanent health insurance and 
death in service insurance.
Service contracts  
and notice periods 
Each of the Executive Directors are 
employed on rolling contracts subject to 
one year’s notice from either Inland Homes 
or the Executive Director in relation to 
Stephen Wicks and Nishith Malde, and 
three months’ notice in relation to Paul 
Brett, and contain confidentiality provisions 
and restrictive covenants for the Company’s 
protection. 
The Executive Directors’ service 
contracts do not provide specifically for 
any termination payments, although the 
Company might make payments in lieu of 
notice. For this purpose, such payments 
would consist of basic salary and other 
benefits for the relevant period and 
depending on the circumstances, any 
awards due under the 2013 LTIP. 
Non-executive Directors
Inland Homes has two independent  
Non-executive Directors, namely Terry 
Roydon, the Chairman and Head of the 
Audit Committee and Simon Bennett,  
Head of the Remuneration Committee.  
Both Non-executive Directors have letters 
of appointment, initially for a three year 
period and thereafter on six months’ notice 
from either Inland Homes or the individual 
and contain confidentiality provisions for 
the Company’s benefit.
The Non-executive Directors’ letters of 
appointment do not provide specifically for 
any termination payments, although the 
Company might make payments in lieu  
of notice. 
Non-executive fees are determined by 
the Executive Directors, having regard to 
the requirement to attract high calibre 
individuals with the right experience, the 
time requirements and the responsibilities 
incumbent on an individual acting as a 
Non-executive Director for a company, 
such as Inland Homes, listed on AIM. The 
Non-executive Directors are not eligible 
for annual discretionary bonuses and do 
not participate in the Company’s long term 
incentive plans. 
The current service contracts of the Executive 
Directors, the letters of appointment of the 
Non-executive Directors and the Rules of the 
2013 LTIP are available for inspection at the 
Company’s registered office during normal 
office hours and at the Company’s Annual 
General Meeting (“AGM”) until the conclusion 
of the AGM.
Directors’ emoluments for 
the year ended 30 June 2017 
A review of the financial results for the 
year ended 30 June 2017, as more fully 
set out in the Chairman’s Statement, the 
Chief Executive’s Review and the Finance 
Director’s Review, demonstrates that Inland 
Homes has had another good year with a 
12.2% increase in net asset value to £130.6 
million (2016 restated*: £116.3 million) and 
an EPRA net asset value for the Group at 
30 June 2017 of 96.22p per ordinary share 
(2016 restated*: 92.34p). Turnover for 
the year at £90.7 million was lower than 
the previous year (2016: £101.9 million) 
and profit before tax and the revaluation 
surplus at £18.1 million showed an increase 
of 15.3% (2016 restated*: £15.7 million), 
whereas profit before tax, which includes 
the revaluation surplus on the Group’s 
investment properties of £1.5m (2016: £18.0 
million), showed a decline (2017: £19.6 
million: 2016 restated* £33.7million). In 
light of the results recorded by the Group, 
the following bonuses have been awarded 
by the Remuneration Committee to the 
Executive Directors, as follows:
Stephen Wicks £72,500
Nishith Malde £72,500
Paul Brett £47,500
In accordance with the rules of the 
Deferred Bonus Plan, further details of 
which are set out above, these bonuses 
will be settled as to 50% in cash and as to 
50% in ordinary shares of the Company. 
The ordinary shares awarded in respect of 
these bonuses will be deferred for three 
years and will be subject to forfeiture in 
the event that an Executive Director leaves 
the Company as a “bad leaver”, but are 
not subject to any further performance 
conditions. The award of ordinary shares 
of the Company will be granted on terms 
that, when they vest, the number of 
ordinary shares subject to the award shall 
be increased by deeming the net dividends 
paid on the ordinary shares from the date 
of the award until the date of vesting to have 
been cumulatively reinvested in additional 
ordinary shares.

2013 LTIP
The initial price for determination of awards under the 2013 LTIP was 46.5 pence per ordinary share. In aggregate, to date, the conditions 
for the issue of 6,000,000 of the 11,350,504 new ordinary shares that can be issued in exchange for vested Growth Shares have been met 
in accordance with the rules of the 2013 LTIP.

Paul Brett 900,000
Since the start of the financial year the Inland Homes share price has traded between a low of 50.25 pence per ordinary share and a high 
of 73.25 pence per ordinary share. The performance target under the 2013 LTIP for the financial year ending on 30 June 2017, which would 
have earned the equivalent of a further 2,000,000 ordinary shares, was not achieved as the Inland Homes plc share price did not exceed 
the necessary threshold price of 84.2 pence per ordinary share for the qualifying period. Under the terms of the 2013 LTIP, the awards in 
this period can be earned in future periods if the share price exceeds the threshold price for the qualifying period. The threshold price for 
the new financial year, which commenced on 1 July 2017 and ends on 30 June 2018, which would earn a further 2,000,000 ordinary shares, 
is 92.6 pence per ordinary share.
Under the terms of the 2013 LTIP, there remain a total of 5,350,504 new ordinary shares that can be issued in exchange for vested Growth 
Shares, once the conditions have been met in accordance with the rules of the 2013 LTIP.

Directors’ Report
The Directors present their report and the 
financial statements of the Group and the 
Company for the year ended 30 June 2017.
Results and dividends
The trading results for the year are set out 
in the Group Income Statement on page 
67 and the Group’s financial position at 
the end of the year is set out in the Group 
Statement of Financial Position on page 
68. Further details of the performance 
during the financial year and expected 
future developments are contained in the 
Chairman’s Statement, Chief Executive’s 
Review and the Finance Director’s Review 
which form part of the Strategic Report.
The Directors have proposed a final 
dividend of 1.2p per share (2016: 0.9p) 
payable on 26 January 2018, subject to 
Shareholders’ approval, to Shareholders at 
the close of business on 29 December 2017.
Business review
A review of the development and 
performance of the business during the 
year and the future outlook of the Group 
is set out in the Chairman’s Statement on 
pages 06 to 08 and the Chief Executive’s 
Review on pages 30 to 33. The Group’s key 
performance indicators are monitored 
closely by the Board and the details of 
performance against these are on pages 28 
and 29.
Financial risk management 
objectives and policies
All potential areas of financial risk are 
regularly monitored and reviewed by 
the Directors and management. Any 
preventative or corrective measures are 
taken as necessary.
The Group uses various financial 
instruments. These include loans, cash and 
trade receivables that arise directly from 
its operations. The main purpose of these 
financial instruments is to raise finance for 
the Group’s operations.
The existence of these financial 
instruments exposes the Group to a number 
of financial risks, which are described in 
more detail in note 26 to the Group financial 
statements.
Capital risk management
The Group’s objectives when managing 
capital are to safeguard the Group’s ability 
to continue as a going concern in order 
to provide returns for shareholders and 
benefits for other stakeholders and to 
maintain an optimal capital structure to 
reduce the cost of capital.
In order to maintain or adjust the capital 
structure, the Group may adjust the amount 
of dividends paid to shareholders, return 
capital to shareholders, issue new shares 
or sell assets to reduce debt.
Consistent with others in the industry, 
the Group monitors capital in relation to 
overall financing. Further information can 
be found in note 25 to the Group financial 
statements.

Employee Benefit Trust
On 16 December 2016 the Group’s Employee 
Benefit Trust purchased 600,000 shares 
of 10p each in Inland Homes plc under the 
terms of the Deferred Bonus Plan. The total 
consideration paid was £365,000.
Going concern
The Board has reviewed the performance 
for the current year and forecasts for the 
future period. It has also considered the 
risks and uncertainties, including credit 
risk and liquidity risk. The Directors have 
considered the present economic climate, 
the state of the housing market and the 
current demand for land with planning 
consent. The Group has continued to see a 
demand for consented land in the areas in 
which it operates. The Group has significant 
forward sales of residential units and is in 
discussions for the sale of some of the land 
within its projects and expects to make 
sufficient disposals in the foreseeable 
future to ensure it has adequate working 
capital for its requirements. The Directors 
are satisfied that the Group will generate 
sufficient cash to meet its liabilities as and 
when they fall due for a period of 12 months 
from signing these financial statements. 
The Directors therefore consider it 
appropriate to prepare the financial 
statements on the going concern basis.
Directors’ responsibilities
The Directors are responsible for  
preparing the annual report and the 
financial statements in accordance with 
applicable laws and regulations. 
Company law requires the Directors to 
prepare financial statements for each 
financial year. Under that law the Directors 
have elected to prepare the Group financial 
statements in accordance with International 
Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as 
adopted by the European Union and have 
elected to prepare the Parent Company 
financial statements in accordance with 
United Kingdom Generally Accepted 
Accounting Practice (United Kingdom 
Accounting Standards and applicable laws). 
Under company law the Directors must not 
approve the financial statements unless 
they are satisfied that they give a true and 
fair view of the state of affairs of the Group 
and Company and of the profit or loss of 
the Group and Company for that period. 
The Directors are also required to prepare 
financial statements in accordance with 
the rules of the London Stock Exchange 
for companies trading securities on the 
Alternative Investment Market. 
In preparing these financial statements,  
the Directors are required to:
• select suitable accounting policies and 
then apply them consistently;
• make judgements and accounting 
estimates that are reasonable and 
prudent;
• state whether they have been prepared 
in accordance with IFRSs as adopted 
by the European Union for the Group 
and UK Accounting standards for the 
Parent Company, subject to any material 
departures disclosed and explained in 
the financial statements; and
• prepare the financial statements on 
the going concern basis unless it is 
inappropriate to presume that the 
Company will continue in business.
The Directors are responsible for 
keeping adequate accounting records 
that are sufficient to show and explain 
the Company’s transactions and disclose 
with reasonable accuracy at any time the 
financial position of the Company and 
enable them to ensure that the financial 
statements comply with the requirements 
of the Companies Act 2006. They are also 
responsible for safeguarding the assets 
of the Company and hence for taking 
reasonable steps for the prevention and 
detection of fraud and other irregularities.
Website publication
The Directors are responsible for 
ensuring the annual report and the 
financial statements are made available 
on a website. Financial statements are 
published on the Company’s website in 
accordance with legislation in the United 
Kingdom governing the preparation and 
dissemination of financial statements, 
which may vary from legislation in other 
jurisdictions. The maintenance and 
integrity of the Company’s website is 
the responsibility of the Directors. The 
Directors’ responsibility also extends  
to the ongoing integrity of the financial 
statements contained therein.
Post balance sheet events
On 5 July 2017 the Group acquired its joint 
venture partner’s interest in two of the 
Project Helix subsidiaries which own  
the Lily’s Walk and Buckingham House 
sites in High Wycombe for £10.3 million.
Annual General Meeting
The Notice covering the AGM together with 
the proposed resolutions is contained in the 
document accompanying this report. The 
AGM will be held on 28 November 2017.
Auditor
A resolution to reappoint BDO LLP  
as auditor for the ensuing year will be 
proposed at the AGM in accordance with 
Section 489 of the Companies Act 2006.

Independent Auditor’s Report to the 
Members of Inland Homes plc
Opinion
We have audited the financial statements of 
Inland Homes plc (the ‘Parent Company’) 
and its subsidiaries (the ‘Group’) for the 
year ended 30 June 2017 which comprise 
the Group income statement, the Group and 
Company statement of financial position, 
the Group statement of cash flows, the 
Group and Company statement of changes 
in equity and the related notes, including a 
summary of significant accounting policies. 
The financial reporting framework that 
has been applied in the preparation of the 
Group financial statements is applicable 
law and International Financial Reporting 
Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the 
European Union. The financial reporting 
framework that has been applied in 
the preparation of the Parent Company 
financial statements is applicable law and 
United Kingdom Accounting Standards, 
including Financial Reporting Standard 101 
Reduced Disclosure Framework (United 
Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting 
Practice).
In our opinion:
• the financial statements give a true and 
fair view of the state of the Group’s and 
of the Parent Company’s affairs as at  
30 June 2017 and of the Group’s profit  
for the year then ended;
• the Group financial statements have 
been properly prepared in accordance 
with IFRSs as adopted by the European 
Union;
• the Parent Company financial 
statements have been properly prepared 
in accordance with United Kingdom 
Generally Accepted Accounting Practice; 
and
• the financial statements have been 
prepared in accordance with the 
requirements of the Companies Act 
2006.
Basis for opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance 
with International Standards on Auditing 
(UK) (ISAs (UK)) and applicable law. Our 
responsibilities under those standards 
are further described in the Auditor’s 
responsibilities for the audit of the financial 
statements section of our report. We are 
independent of the Group and the Parent 
Company in accordance with the ethical 
requirements that are relevant to our 
audit of the financial statements in the 
UK, including the FRC’s Ethical Standard 
as applied to listed entities, and we have 
fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities 
in accordance with these requirements. 
We believe that the audit evidence we have 
obtained is sufficient and appropriate to 
provide a basis for our opinion.
Conclusions relating  
to going concern
We have nothing to report in respect of the 
following matters in relation to which the 
ISAs (UK) require us to report to you where:
• the directors’ use of the going concern 
basis of accounting in the preparation 
of the financial statements is not 
appropriate; or
• the directors have not disclosed in 
the financial statements any identified 
material uncertainties that may cast 
significant doubt about the Group’s or 
the Parent Company’s ability to continue 
to adopt the going concern basis of 
accounting for a period of at least twelve 
months from the date when the financial 
statements are authorised for issue.
Key audit matters
Key audit matters are those matters that, 
in our professional judgment, were of most 
significance in our audit of the financial 
statements of the current period and 
include the most significant assessed risks 
of material misstatement (whether or not 
due to fraud) we identified, including those 
which had the greatest effect on: the overall 
audit strategy, the allocation of resources 
in the audit; and directing the efforts of the 
engagement team. These matters were 
addressed in the context of our audit of 
the financial statements as a whole, and 
in forming our opinion thereon, and we do 
not provide a separate opinion on these 
matters.

Valuation of investment properties and carrying value of trading properties
Risk Response
The Group owns a portfolio of properties which are held as 
either investment properties or trading properties.
Investment properties, including those in the course of 
development, are held at fair value in the Group financial 
statements. Trading properties are carried in the Group 
statement of financial position at the lower of cost and net 
realisable value. 
The valuation of the Group’s investment properties has been 
carried out by the Directors. 
Determination of the fair value of investment properties and 
the carrying amount of trading properties is considered a 
significant audit risk due to the subjective nature of certain 
assumptions and the potential for management bias inherent 
in each valuation.
Each valuation requires consideration of the individual nature 
of the property, its location, its cash flows and comparable 
market transactions. The majority of the Group’s property 
interests are in the course of development. The valuation of 
these properties requires estimation of the expected sales 
value the completed developments will achieve with deductions 
for future build costs to completion, which requires significant 
judgements. Judgements in relation to future sales values 
and build costs in particular are impacted by the political 
and economic uncertainty arising from the result of the EU 
referendum.
The valuation of the Group’s income generating investment 
properties requires significant judgements to be made in 
relation to the appropriate market capitalisation yields and 
estimated rental values.
Trading properties
As part of our audit work we assessed whether trading stock was included 
in the balance sheet at the lower of cost and net realisable value. We 
also undertook audit work in relation to the fair value of the investment 
properties and trading stock. Our audit work included, but was not 
restricted to, the following:
• We agreed a sample of data used by valuers back to source 
documentation, including title deed and tenancy agreements.
• We assessed the movement in the valuation of the property portfolio 
against our own expectations and challenged the directors or external 
valuers, as appropriate, for those valuations which fall outside of our 
range of expectations.
• Where relevant we obtained any post year end sales agreements for 
whole sites to support the carrying value at the year end.
• We obtained all copies of any planning permission documents 
received in the year to support the uplift in land values.
• We obtained project appraisals prepared by the directors for each 
development and: 
 — Reviewed and assessed costs to complete and compared these to 
developments of a similar nature;
 — Considered the historic accuracy of cost and sales forecasts;
 — Where properties have been exchanged, reserved or sold post 
year end, obtained support for a sample and compared the 
prices achieved to those in the development appraisals. Where 
no activity has occurred, we performed a comparison of prices 
achieved on similar properties sold or comparable market 
transactions; and
 — We visited the Group’s development sites at Venture House, 
Wilton Park and The Pheasant and considered the stage of the 
development compared to the costs to complete in the project 
appraisal. 
Investment properties
• We obtained the valuation schedules prepared by the directors and;
 — Evaluated the competence and capability of the director;
 — Confirmed that the basis of the valuation was in accordance with 
requirements of IFRS; and
 — Discussed the basis of the valuation, the assumptions used and 
the valuation movements in the year with the director; 
• We considered whether movements in the valuations are consistent 
with our own expectations based upon market comparable 
transactions and changes in industry benchmarks.
• We challenged those valuations which fell outside of our expectations.
• We reviewed the significant valuation inputs used by the directors 
against our own expectations, underlying supporting evidence and, 
where relevant, market data.
• We obtained external valuations performed during the year, tested 
the inputs and compared the valuation and its inputs to the valuation 
prepared by the directors.
• For a sample of investment properties we corroborated the rental 
income to supporting leases.

Independent Auditor’s Report to  
the Members of Inland Homes plc
Revenue and profit recognition
Risk Response
The group has numerous sources of revenue which comprise:
• sale of land; 
• housebuilding; 
• contract income; 
• hotel revenue; and 
• rental income. 
Proceeds from the sale of land and buildings should only be 
recognised once the risks and rewards of ownership have 
passed to the buyer which is considered to be completion. 
Revenue and profits on house sales could be manipulated both 
through sales recognised before completion and also through 
management incorrectly allocating costs on different phases to 
skew the margin on multi-phase developments.
There were a significant number of completions that occurred 
in June 2017 and we therefore also identified cut off as a 
significant audit risk. 
The accounting for the revenue from contract income is 
inherently complex and involves significant judgement 
particularly with regard to assessing the stage of completion 
of the project. This increases the inherent risk of fraud 
and management bias. Revenue from long term contracts 
is recognised based upon management’s assessment 
of the value of works carried out, with regard to external 
quantity surveyor reports, having considered the anticipated 
programme of works and the costs incurred and to complete. 
Profit is recognised once the directors are able to make an 
estimate of the outcome with reasonable certainty.
Our audit work included, but was not restricted to, the following:
Sale of land and buildings
• We agreed a sample of sales to completion statement and the 
proceeds to bank. To address cut off, we tested all sales that occurred 
in June 2017 and ensured that completion took place pre year end. 
For post year end receipts we obtained the completion statement for 
the associated sale and ensured that it was recognised in the correct 
period. 
• We reviewed the realised margin on the land and building sales in 
the year compared to the expected margin obtained from the original 
development appraisal. 
• We reviewed the calculation and the basis upon which site wide costs 
had been allocated to the different stages of the development. We 
checked the calculation against the forecast appraisals to ensure 
that the allocation was in line with the split of future revenue for the 
different stages of the site. 
Contract income
For each development contract we obtained copies of the construction 
contract and performed the following:
• We agreed the total value of the development to the signed contract;
• Reviewed the forecast profitability;
• Verified the underlying stage of completion to the valuation certificate 
provided by each external quantity surveyor engaged to certify the 
value of the work completed; 
• Reviewed the key assumptions within each development appraisal 
against the contract terms and agreed details to supporting 
documentation where relevant;
• Assessed the stage of completion against the proportion of profit 
recognised to date.

Our application  
of materiality
We apply the concept of materiality both 
in planning and performing our audit, and 
in evaluating the effect of misstatements. 
For planning, we consider materiality to be 
the magnitude by which misstatements, 
including omissions, could influence the 
economic decisions of reasonable users 
that are taken on the basis of the financial 
statements. In order to reduce to an 
appropriately low level the probability that 
any misstatements exceed materiality, we 
use a lower materiality level, performance 
materiality, to determine the extent of 
testing needed. Importantly, misstatements 
below these levels will not necessarily 
be evaluated as immaterial as we also 
take account of the nature of identified 
misstatements, and the particular 
circumstances of their occurrence, when 
evaluating their effect on the financial 
statements as a whole.
The materiality for the Group financial 
statements as a whole was set at £1.18 
million. This was determined with reference 
to a benchmark of profit before tax (PBT) 
and represents 7% of PBT. This was 
considered to be the most appropriate 
measurement given the trading nature of 
the business. The materiality for the Parent 
Company was set at £895k which was 
calculated at 1.5% of total assets. This was 
considered the most appropriate measure 
given that the nature of the entity is as a 
holding company. 
Performance materiality was set at 60% of 
the above materiality level.
We agreed with the Audit Committee that 
we would report to them all individual audit 
differences in excess of £25,000. We also 
agreed to report differences below this 
threshold that, in our view, warranted 
reporting on qualitative grounds.
An overview of the  
scope of our audit
A description of the scope of an audit 
of financial statements is provided on 
the FRC’s website at www.frc.org.uk/
auditscopeukprivate.
Our Group audit was scoped by obtaining 
an understanding of the Group and its 
environment, including the Group’s system 
of internal control, and assessing the risks 
of material misstatement at the Group level. 
Audit work to respond to the assessed 
risks was performed directly by the Group 
audit engagement team which performed 
full scope audit procedures on each of the 
Group’s component entities. Our audit work 
at each of these components was executed 
at levels of materiality applicable to the 
relevant component, which in each instance 
was lower than Group materiality.
Other information
The directors are responsible for the 
other information. The other information 
comprises the information included in the 
annual report, other than the financial 
statements and our auditor’s report 
thereon. Our opinion on the financial 
statements does not cover the other 
information and, except to the extent 
otherwise explicitly stated in our report, 
we do not express any form of assurance 
conclusion thereon.
In connection with our audit of the financial 
statements, our responsibility is to read 
the other information and, in doing so, 
consider whether the other information is 
materially inconsistent with the financial 
statements or our knowledge obtained 
in the audit or otherwise appears to be 
materially misstated. If we identify such 
material inconsistencies or apparent 
material misstatements, we are required 
to determine whether there is a material 
misstatement in the financial statements 
or a material misstatement of the other 
information. If, based on the work we 
have performed, we conclude that there 
is a material misstatement of this other 
information; we are required to report 
that fact. We have nothing to report in this 
regard.
Opinions on other  
matters prescribed by  
the Companies Act 2006
In our opinion, based on the work 
undertaken in the course of the audit:
• the information given in the strategic 
report and the directors’ report for the 
financial year for which the financial 
statements are prepared is consistent 
with the financial statements; and
• the strategic report and the directors’ 
report have been prepared in 
accordance with applicable legal 
requirements.
Matters on which we  
are required to report  
by exception
In the light of the knowledge and 
understanding of the Group and the Parent 
Company and their environments obtained 
in the course of the audit, we have not 
identified material misstatements in the 
strategic report or the directors’ report.
We have nothing to report in respect of the 
following matters in relation to which the 
Companies Act 2006 requires us to report 
to you if, in our opinion:
• adequate accounting records have not 
been kept by the Parent Company, or 
returns adequate for our audit have not 
been received from branches not visited 
by us; or
• the Parent Company financial 
statements are not in agreement with 
the accounting records and returns; or
• certain disclosures of directors’ 
remuneration specified by law are not

Independent Auditor’s Report to  
the Members of Inland Homes plc
Responsibilities of directors
As explained more fully in the directors’ 
responsibilities statement the directors 
are responsible for the preparation of the 
financial statements and for being satisfied 
that they give a true and fair view, and 
for such internal control as the directors 
determine is necessary to enable the 
preparation of financial statements that are 
free from material misstatement, whether 
due to fraud or error.
In preparing the financial statements, the 
directors are responsible for assessing the 
Group’s and the Parent Company’s ability 
to continue as a going concern, disclosing, 
as applicable, matters related to going 
concern and using the going concern basis 
of accounting unless the directors either 
intend to liquidate the Group or the Parent 
Company or to cease operations, or have no 
realistic alternative but to do so.
Auditor’s responsibilities  
for the audit of the  
financial statements
This report is made solely to the Company’s 
members, as a body, in accordance with 
Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 
2006. Our audit work has been undertaken 
so that we might state to the Company’s 
members those matters we are required 
to state to them in an auditor’s report and 
for no other purpose. To the fullest extent 
permitted by law, we do not accept or 
assume responsibility to anyone other than 
the Company and the Company’s members 
as a body, for our audit work, for this report, 
or for the opinions we have formed.
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable 
assurance about whether the financial 
statements as a whole are free from 
material misstatement, whether due to 
fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s 
report that includes our opinion. 
Reasonable assurance is a high level of 
assurance, but is not a guarantee that 
an audit conducted in accordance with 
ISAs (UK) will always detect a material 
misstatement when it exists.
Misstatements can arise from fraud or 
error and are considered material if, 
individually or in the aggregate, they could 
reasonably be expected to influence the 
economic decisions of users taken on the 
basis of these financial statements.
A further description of our responsibilities 
for the audit of the financial statements 
is located on the Financial Reporting 
Council’s website at: www.frc.org.uk/
auditorsresponsibilities. This description 
forms part of our auditor’s report.

Notes to the Group Financial Statements 
For the year ended 30 June 2017
1. Accounting Policies
The principal accounting policies adopted in the preparation of the Group financial statements are set out below.
Basis of preparation
The Group financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention, except for certain financial instruments and 
investment properties which are measured at fair value, and in accordance with applicable International Financial Reporting Standards 
(IFRS) as adopted by the EU and as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board. These financial statements have also 
been prepared in accordance with those parts of the Companies Act 2006 that are relevant to companies that prepare their financial 
statements in accordance with IFRS.
The consolidated financial statements present the results of the Group as if it formed a single entity. Intercompany transactions and 
balances between Group companies are therefore eliminated in full.
Each year the Group reassesses its judgements in relation to accounting policies which it has adopted. During a review of properties held 
within inventories the Directors were of the opinion that the Wilton Park site meets the criteria for the capitalisation of interest required 
under IAS 23 Borrowing Costs. Further information on this assessment can be found in note 3. Further information on the financial 
impact of this reassessment can be found in note 29.
Disclosure exemptions adopted
In preparing the financial statements of the Parent Company, advantage has been taken of all disclosure exemptions conferred by  
FRS 101. Therefore, the Parent Company financial statements do not include:
• certain comparative information as otherwise required by EU endorsed IFRS;
• a statement of cash flows;
• the effect of future accounting standards not yet adopted;
• disclosure of related party transactions with other wholly owned members of the group headed by Inland Homes plc.
In addition, and in accordance with FRS 101 further disclosure exemptions have been adopted because equivalent disclosures are 
included in the consolidated financial statements of Inland Homes plc. The Parent Company financial statements do not include certain 
disclosures in respect of:
• Financial Instruments (other than certain disclosures required as a result of recording financial instruments at fair value); and 
• Fair value measurement (other than certain disclosures required as a result of recording financial instruments at fair value). 
The Company has taken advantage of the exemption allowed under section 408 of the Companies Act 2006 and has not presented its own 
profit and loss account in these financial statements.
At the date of approval of these financial statements, certain new standards, amendments and interpretations to existing standards have 
been published by the IASB but are not yet effective, and have not been adopted early by the Group.
Management anticipates that all of the relevant pronouncements will be adopted in the Group’s accounting policies for the first period 
beginning after the effective date of the pronouncement. Information on new standards, amendments and interpretations that are 
expected to be relevant to the Group’s financial statements is provided below. 
Standards in issue but not yet effective
New standards and interpretations currently in issue but not effective, based on EU mandatory effective dates, for accounting periods 
commencing on 1 July 2016 are:
• IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers (EU effective date 1 January 2018)
• IFRS 9 Financial Instruments (EU effective date 1 January 2018)
• IFRS 16 Leases (EU effective date 1 January 2019)
• Amendments to IAS 12 Recognition of Deferred Tax Assets for Unrealised Losses (EU effective date 1 January 2017)
• Amendments to IAS 7 Disclosure Initiative (EU effective date 1 January 2017)
• Amendments to IFRS 2 Classification and Measurement of Share-based Payment Transactions (EU effective date 1 January 2018)
• Amendments to IFRS 1 – Annual Improvements to IFRSs (2014-2016 cycle) (EU effective date 1 January 2018)
• Amendments to IAS 28 – Annual Improvements to IFRSs (2014-2016 cycle) (EU effective date 1 January 2018)
• Amendments to IFRS 12 – Annual Improvements to IFRSs (2014-2016 cycle) (EU effective date 1 January 2017)
• Amendments to IAS 40 – Transfers of Investment Property (EU effective date 1 January 2018)
• IFRIC 23 Uncertainty over Income Tax Treatments (EU effective date 1 January 2019)

1. Accounting Policies continued
IFRS 9 – The Group is currently assessing the impact of the revisions on the Group’s results and financial position. IFRS 9 may impact  
on the measurement of long term receivables, but the Directors do not expect the standard to have a material impact on the Group.
IFRS 15 – The Directors consider that there is a potential impact on adoption of the standard on the accounting for long term construction 
contracts. This currently represents less than 5% of the total revenue stream, any impact is therefore considered unlikely to have a 
material impact on current contracts and will be dependent on the terms of the individual contracts in place at the time IFRS 15 is 
adopted. The Directors are in the process of assessing the impact of the new standard on future construction contracts. Given the  
Group’s pipeline such contracts may form a greater proportion of total revenue in future years. Whilst the directors consider that other 
areas are not expected to be materially affected by IFRS 15, a full impact analysis will be undertaken in the financial year 2018.
IFRS 16 – It is expected that the Group’s lease commitment at the head office will be brought onto the statement of financial position 
together with the corresponding assets. The Directors are currently negotiating the terms of a new lease, and therefore the quantum  
is currently unknown. 
Going concern
The Board has reviewed the performance for the current year and forecasts for the future period. It has also considered the risks and 
uncertainties, including credit risk and liquidity risk. The Directors have considered the present economic climate, the state of the 
housing market and the current demand for land with planning consent. The Group has continued to see an increase in demand for 
consented land in the areas in which it operates. The Group has significant forward sales of residential units and is in discussions for  
the sale of some of the land within its projects and expects to make sufficient disposals in the foreseeable future to ensure it has 
adequate working capital for its requirements. The Directors are satisfied that the Group will generate sufficient cash to meet its 
liabilities as and when they fall due for a period of at least 12 months from signing these financial statements. The Directors therefore 
consider it appropriate to prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis. 
Basis of consolidation
The Group’s financial statements consolidate the financial statements of the Company and all of its subsidiary undertakings drawn up 
to 30 June 2017. Where the Company has control over an investee, it is classified as a subsidiary. The Company controls an investee if all 
three of the following elements are present: power over the subsidiary; exposure, or rights to, the variable returns from its involvement 
with the subsidiary; and the ability to affect those returns through its power over the subsidiary. The Group obtains and exercises control 
through voting rights, development agreements and option agreements. Further information can be found in note 3.
Unrealised gains on transactions between the Group and its subsidiaries are eliminated. Unrealised losses are also eliminated unless 
the transaction provides evidence of an impairment of the asset transferred. Amounts reported in the financial statements of subsidiaries 
have been adjusted where necessary to ensure consistency with the accounting policies adopted by the Group.
Acquisitions of subsidiaries are dealt with by the acquisition method. The method involves the recognition at fair value of all identifiable 
assets and liabilities, including contingent liabilities and non-controlling interests of the subsidiary, at the acquisition date, regardless 
of whether or not they were recorded in the financial statements of the subsidiary prior to acquisition. On initial recognition, the assets 
and liabilities of the subsidiary are included in the Group Statement of Financial Position at their fair values, which are also used as the 
basis for subsequent measurement in accordance with the Group accounting policies. Goodwill is stated after separating out identifiable 
intangible assets. Goodwill represents the excess of the fair value of the consideration transferred over the fair value of the Group’s share 
of the identifiable net assets and non-controlling interests of the acquired subsidiary at the date of acquisition. 
At the time of acquisition, the Group considers whether each acquisition represents the acquisition of a business or the acquisition of an 
asset. The Group accounts for an acquisition as a business combination where an integrated set of activities is acquired in addition to 
the property. Where such acquisitions are not judged to be the acquisition of a business, they are not treated as business combinations. 
Rather, the cost to acquire the corporate entity is allocated between the identifiable assets and liabilities of the entity based upon their 
relative fair values at the acquisition date. Accordingly, no goodwill or additional deferred tax arises.

Notes to the Group Financial Statements 
For the year ended 30 June 2017
1. Accounting Policies continued
Joint ventures
Joint ventures are entities in which the Group has shared control with another entity, established by contractual agreement. Jointly 
controlled entities are accounted for using the equity method from the date that joint control is obtained to the date that the joint 
control of the entity ceases. All subsequent changes to the share of interest in the equity of the joint venture are recognised in the 
Group’s carrying amount of the investment. Changes resulting from the profit or loss generated by the joint venture are recognised in 
the Group’s carrying amount of the investment. Changes resulting from the profit or loss generated by the joint venture are reported 
in ‘share of profits of joint venture’ in the Group Income Statement and therefore affect the net results of the Group. These changes 
include subsequent depreciation, amortisation or impairment of the fair value adjustments of assets and liabilities. If the share of losses 
equals its investment, the Group does not recognise further losses, except to the extent that there are amounts receivable that may not 
be recovered or there are further commitments to provide funding. Both realised and unrealised gains on transactions between the 
Group and its joint ventures are eliminated to the extent of the Group’s investment in joint ventures. Realised and unrealised losses are 
also eliminated unless the transaction provides evidence of an impairment of the asset transferred. The accounting policies of the joint 
ventures are consistent with those of the Group.
Associates
Where the Group has significant influence but not control or joint control over the financial and operating policy decisions of another 
entity, it is classified as an associate. Associates are initially recorded in the Group Balance Sheet at cost. Changes resulting from the 
Group’s share of post-acquisition profits and losses are recognised in the Group’s carrying amount of the investment. Changes resulting 
from the profit or loss generated by the associate are reported in ‘share of profits of associate’ in the Group Income Statement and 
therefore affect the net results of the Group. These changes include subsequent depreciation, amortisation or impairment of the fair  
value adjustments of assets and liabilities. If the share of losses equals its investment, the Group does not recognise further losses, 
except to the extent that there are amounts receivable that may not be recovered or there are further commitments to provide funding. 
The accounting policies of the associate are consistent with those of the Group.
Business combinations
At the time of acquisition, the Group considers whether each acquisition represents the acquisition of a business or the acquisition  
of an asset. The Group accounts for an acquisition as a business combination where an integrated set of activities is acquired in addition 
to the property. Where such acquisitions are not judged to be the acquisition of a business, they are not treated as business combinations. 
Rather, the cost to acquire the corporate entity is allocated between the identifiable assets and liabilities of the entity based upon their 
relative fair values at the acquisition date. Accordingly, no goodwill or additional deferred tax arises.
Revenue
Revenue is measured by reference to the fair value of consideration received or receivable by the Group for goods supplied, excluding  
VAT and trade discounts. 
Sale of land and residential units
Revenue from the sale of land is recognised on legal completion when all the following conditions have been satisfied:
• the Group has transferred to the buyer the significant risks and rewards of ownership of the goods which is when contracts have been 
completed, which is when title passes;
• the Group retains neither continuing managerial involvement to the degree usually associated with ownership nor effective control 
over the land sold which is when the contract has been completed;
• the amount of revenue can be measured reliably;
• it is probable that the economic benefits associated with the transaction will flow to the Group; and 
• the costs incurred or to be incurred in respect of the transaction can be measured reliably. 
Contract income
The Group acts as a main contractor on certain building projects, primarily on behalf of housing associations where the Group must 
provide social housing units as part of its S106 obligations under the planning consent or has sold the land to the housing association 
and entered into a construction contract to provide the completed units. Once the Group considers that the outcome of the contract 
can be reliably estimated, revenue and profit is recognised on the basis of the proportion of the contract that is completed. The stage of 
completion is determined by reference to the valuation certificate provided by a third party surveyor engaged to certify the value of works 
completed at various intervals in respect of the contract sum.

Golden brick income
On sites where the Group acts as a main contractor the contract income is usually preceded by a land sale which takes place once 
construction has reached one level of bricks above the damp proof course. This is authorised by an agent of the purchaser and at this 
point title passes.
Interest receivable
Interest is recognised using the effective interest method which calculates the amortised cost of a financial asset and allocates the 
interest income over the relevant period. The effective interest rate is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash receipts 
through the expected life of the financial asset to the net carrying amount of the financial asset. 
Rental Income 
Rental income derived from operating leases is recognised on a straight line basis over the lease term.
Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost, net of depreciation and any provision for impairment. 
Disposal of assets
The gain or loss arising on the disposal of an asset is determined as the difference between the disposal proceeds and the carrying 
amount of the asset and is recognised in the Group Income Statement. 
Depreciation
Depreciation is calculated to write down the cost less estimated residual value of all property, plant and equipment by the straight line 
method where it reflects the basis of consumption of the asset. The rates generally applicable are: 
Fixtures and fittings – 25% 
Office equipment – 25%
Motor vehicles – 25% 
Leasehold property – Over shorter of lease term and useful economic life 
Material residual value estimates are reviewed as required, but at least annually.
Investment property
Investment properties are those properties which are not occupied by the Group and which are held for long-term rental yields, capital 
appreciation or both. Investment property also includes property that will be developed for future use as investment property.
Investment properties are initially measured at cost, including related transaction costs. At each subsequent reporting date they are 
remeasured to their fair value. Movements in fair value are included in the Group Income Statement.
Subsequent expenditure is capitalised to the asset’s carrying value only where it is probable that the future economic benefits associated 
with the expenditure will flow to the Group.
Any gain or loss resulting from the sale of an investment property is immediately recognised in the Group Income Statement. An 
investment property shall be derecognised on disposal. When the Directors consider that the status of the property has changed to 
being a development property it is transferred to inventories. A property is transferred to inventories when it has been decided that the 
units being constructed will be sold and no future rental income is expected. When a partial disposal or transfer is made, the proportion 
relating to the disposal or transfer is derecognised.
Where the Group employs professional valuers the valuations provided are subject to a comprehensive review to ensure they are based 
on accurate and up-to-date tenancy and market information. Discussions are also held with the valuers to test the valuation assumptions 
applied and comparable evidence utilised to ensure they are appropriate in the circumstances.
Inventories
Inventories consist of land and work in progress and are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost includes the purchase 
of sites, the cost of infrastructure and construction works, and legal and professional fees incurred during development prior to sale.  
Net realisable value is estimated based upon the future expected selling price, less estimated costs to sell.

Notes to the Group Financial Statements 
For the year ended 30 June 2017
1. Accounting Policies continued
Taxation
Current tax is the tax currently payable based on taxable profit for the period calculated using tax rates and laws substantively enacted  
at the reporting date. 
Deferred income taxes are calculated using the liability method on temporary differences. Deferred tax is generally provided on the 
difference between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their tax bases. However, deferred tax is not provided on the initial 
recognition of goodwill, nor on the initial recognition of an asset or liability unless the related transaction is a business combination or 
affects tax or accounting profit. Temporary differences include those associated with shares in subsidiaries and joint ventures unless 
reversal of these temporary differences can be controlled by the Group and it is probable that reversal will not occur in the foreseeable 
future. In addition, tax losses available to be carried forward as well as other income tax credits to the Group are assessed for recognition 
as deferred tax assets. 
Deferred tax liabilities are provided in full, with no discounting. Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that  
the underlying deductible temporary differences will be able to be offset against future taxable income. Current and deferred tax assets 
and liabilities are calculated at tax rates and laws that are expected to apply to their respective period of realisation, provided they are 
enacted or substantively enacted at the year end date. 
Changes in deferred tax assets or liabilities are recognised as a component of tax expense in the Group Income Statement except where 
they relate to items that are recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity in which case the related deferred tax is also 
recognised in other comprehensive income or equity respectively. 
Leased assets
Lease payments (excluding costs for services such as insurance and maintenance) applicable to operating leases where substantially all 
the benefits and risks of ownership remain with the lessor are recognised as an expense on a straight line basis over the lease term. 
Employee benefits
Defined contribution retirement benefit scheme
The pension costs charged against operating profits are the contributions payable to the scheme in respect of the accounting period. 
Equity-settled share-based payment 
All shared-based payment arrangements are recognised in the Group financial statements. All goods and services received in exchange 
for the grant of any share-based payment are measured at their fair values using the Black-Scholes options pricing model for share 
options and the Monte Carlo simulation technique for LTIPs. Where employees are rewarded using share-based payments, the fair values 
of employees’ services are determined indirectly by reference to the fair value of the instrument granted to the employee. This fair value 
is appraised at the grant date and excludes the impact of any non-market vesting conditions. The Black–Scholes model is used to value 
the share options because it relies on fixed inputs and the options do not have non-standard features. The Monte Carlo simulation is more 
suitable to value LTIPs as they depend on the share price changing over time and therefore have more complex vesting conditions than  
the share options.
Share options are awarded to all eligible members of staff on a discretionary basis and there are no service or performance conditions 
attached to them, other than that the member of staff awarded the options are still employed by the Company at the time of the options being 
exercised. LTIPs are awarded to the three Executive Directors based on share price performance as explained in the Remuneration Report.
All equity-settled share-based payments are ultimately recognised as an expense in the Group Income Statement with a corresponding 
credit to retained earnings. 
If vesting periods or other non-market vesting conditions apply, the expense is allocated over the vesting period, based on the best 
available estimate of the number of share options or LTIPs expected to vest. Estimates are subsequently revised if there is any indication 
that the number of share options or LTIPs expected to vest differs from previous estimates. Any cumulative adjustment prior to vesting is 
recognised in the current period. No adjustment is made to any expense recognised in prior periods if share options or LTIPs ultimately 
exercised are different to that estimated on vesting. 
Upon exercise of the share options or LTIPs the proceeds received net of attributed transaction costs are credited to share capital and, 
where appropriate, share premium. 
The Executive Directors receive 50% of bonuses in shares which are purchased by the Employee Benefit Trust and the remaining 50% in 
cash. The number of shares purchased correspond to the number of shares which would have been able to be purchased at the closing 
price on 30 June for the relevant year. The shares will be transferred to the Directors three years after the award date. The amount of the 
bonus awarded each year is explained in the Remuneration Report.

1. Accounting Policies continued
Employee Benefit Trust
The Directors consider that the Employee Benefit Trust (EBT) is under the de facto control of the Company as the trustees look to the 
Directors to determine how to dispense the assets. Therefore the assets and liabilities of the EBT have been consolidated into the Group 
accounts. The EBT’s investment in the Company’s shares is eliminated on consolidation and shown as a deduction against equity. Any 
assets in the EBT will cease to be recognised in the Group Statement of Financial Position when those assets vest unconditionally in 
identified beneficiaries.
Financial assets
Financial assets are divided into the following categories: loans and receivables and financial assets at fair value through profit or loss. 
Financial assets are assigned to the different categories by management on initial recognition, depending on the purpose for which they 
were acquired. 
All financial assets are recognised when the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument. Financial assets 
other than those categorised as at fair value through profit or loss are initially recognised at fair value plus transaction costs. Financial 
assets categorised at fair value through profit or loss are recognised initially at fair value with transaction costs expensed through the 
Group Income Statement. 
Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss include financial assets that are designated by the entity as at fair value through profit 
or loss upon initial recognition. Subsequent to initial recognition, the financial assets included in this category are measured at fair value 
with changes in fair value recognised in the Group Income Statement. Financial assets originally designated as financial assets at fair 
value through profit or loss may not be reclassified subsequently. 
Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market. 
Trade receivables and loans to associates and joint ventures are classified as loans and receivables. Loans and receivables are measured 
subsequent to initial recognition at amortised cost using the effective interest method, less provision for impairment. Any change in their 
value through impairment or reversal of impairment is recognised in the Group Income Statement. 
Provision against trade receivables is made when there is objective evidence that the Group will not be able to collect all amounts due  
to it in accordance with the original terms of those receivables. The amount of the write-down is determined as the difference between 
the asset’s carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows, discounted at the original effective interest rate. 
Interest and other income resulting from holding financial assets are recognised in the Group Income Statement. 
A financial asset is derecognised only where the contractual rights to the cash flows from the asset expire, or the financial asset is 
transferred and that transfer qualifies for derecognition. A financial asset is transferred if the contractual rights to receive the cash 
flows of the asset have been transferred or the Group retains the contractual rights to receive the cash flow of the asset, but assumes 
a contractual obligation to pay the cash flows to one or more recipients. A financial asset that is transferred qualifies for derecognition 
if the Group transfers substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the asset, or if the Group neither retains nor transfers 
substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership but does transfer control of that asset. 
Borrowing costs
The Group capitalises borrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of a qualifying asset as part of 
the cost of that asset where developments are considered to fall under the requirements of IAS 23 Borrowing Costs (Revised). Qualifying 
assets are those which are being constructed over a significant period of time, which Inland interpret to be over 12 months, and are 
complex in their nature. The majority of the Group’s sites involve the development of large volumes of properties in a repetitive manner. 
The Group therefore expenses borrowing costs relating to such developments in the period to which they relate through the income 
statement using the effective interest method which calculates the amortised cost of a financial asset and allocates the interest income 
over the relevant period. The effective interest rate is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash receipts through the expected 
life of the financial asset to the net carrying amount of the financial asset. Currently, the group capitalises borrowing costs only in relation 
to the site at Wilton Park and its joint venture site at Cheshunt as these are the only sites that are considered sufficiently complex in 
nature and will take over 12 months to develop.

Notes to the Group Financial Statements 
For the year ended 30 June 2017
1. Accounting Policies continued
Financial liabilities 
Financial liabilities are obligations to pay cash or other financial assets and are recognised when the Group becomes a party to the 
contractual provisions of the instrument. 
All financial liabilities are recorded at amortised cost using the effective interest method, with interest-related charges recognised  
as an expense in finance cost in the Group Income Statement. Finance charges, including premiums payable on settlement or redemption 
and direct issue costs, are charged to the Group Income Statement on an accruals basis using the effective interest method and are 
added to the carrying amount of the instrument to the extent that they are not settled in the period in which they arise. 
A financial liability is derecognised only when the obligation is extinguished, that is, when the obligation is discharged, cancelled  
or expires. 
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash in hand and demand deposits, together with other short term, highly liquid investments that  
are readily convertible into known amounts of cash and which are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value.
Dividends
Dividend distributions payable to equity shareholders are included in other short term financial liabilities when the dividends are approved 
in a general meeting prior to the year end date. Interim dividends are recognised when paid.
Equity
An equity instrument is a contract which evidences a residual interest in the assets after deducting all liabilities. Equity comprises the 
following:
• ‘Share capital’ represents the nominal value of equity shares;
• ‘Share premium’ represents the excess over nominal value of the fair value of consideration received for equity shares, net of expenses 
of the share issue;
• ‘Employee benefit trust’ represents the purchase of the Company’s own shares and are deducted from total equity until they are issued 
to employees under the Long Term Incentive Plan;
• ‘Special reserve’ represents the distributable surplus created by the transfer of an amount from the share premium to rectify the 
deficit which existed on the retained earnings reserve; and 
• ‘Retained earnings reserve’ represents retained profits 
2. Segment Information
In accordance with IFRS 8, information is disclosed to enable users of financial statements to evaluate the nature and financial effects  
of the business activities in which the Group engages. 
In identifying its operating segments, management differentiates between land sales, housebuilding, contract income, rental income, 
hotel income, investments, investment properties, management fees and other income. These segments are based on the information 
reported to the chief operating decision maker and represent the activities which generate significant revenues, profits and use of 
resources within the Group. An analysis of the Group’s results by segment is disclosed in note 4. 
INLAND HOMES ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 78 Stock code: INL 25624.01 – 11 October 2017 11:42 AM – Proof 2
3. Critical Accounting Estimates and Judgements 
Estimates and judgements are continually evaluated and are based on historic experience and other factors, including expectations of 
future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. 
Critical accounting estimates
The Group makes estimates and assumptions concerning the future. The resulting accounting estimates will, by definition, rarely equal 
the related actual results. The estimates and assumptions that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying 
amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year are outlined below. 
(a) Valuation of inventories (note 16)
In applying the Group’s accounting policy for the valuation of inventories the Directors are required to assess the expected selling price 
and costs to sell each of the plots or units that constitute the Group’s land bank and work in progress. Cost includes the cost of acquisition 
of sites, the cost of infrastructure and construction works, and legal and professional fees incurred during development prior to sale. 
Estimation of the selling price is subject to significant inherent uncertainties, in particular the prediction of future trends in the market 
value of land. 
Whilst the Directors exercise due care and attention to make reasonable estimates, taking into account all available information in 
estimating the future selling price, the estimates will, in all likelihood, differ from the actual selling prices achieved in future periods  
and these differences may, in certain circumstances, be very significant. The critical judgement in respect of receipt of planning consent 
(see below) further increases the level of estimation uncertainty in this area. 
(b) Income taxes (notes 9 & 15)
The Group recognises tax/deferred tax assets and liabilities for anticipated tax based on estimates of when the tax/deferred tax will be 
paid or recovered. When the final outcome of these matters is different from the amounts initially recorded, such differences impact the 
period in which the determination is made. Critical accounting estimates relate to the profit forecasts used to determine the extent to 
which deferred tax assets are recognised from available losses and the period over which they are estimated. 
(c) Fair value of derivatives and other financial instruments (note 26)
The fair value of instruments that are not traded in an active market is determined by using valuation techniques. The Group uses its 
judgement to select a variety of methods and makes assumptions that are mainly based on market conditions existing. 
(d) Fair value of investment properties (note 12)
The fair value of materially completed investment property is determined by independent valuation experts using the open market value 
of existing use method, subject to current leases and restrictions, as this has been assessed currently as the best use of these assets. 
Investment properties awaiting construction are valued by the Directors using an appraisal system; critical accounting estimates relate  
to the forecasts prepared in order to assess the carrying value. 
(e) Discounting on deferred consideration of inventories, disposal of joint ventures and acquisition of shares (notes 7, 14 & 16)
The Group discounts deferred consideration using the discounted cash flow method; the Group considers that the cost of debt capital  
is the most appropriate discount rate and this is a significant estimate. 
Critical judgements in applying the entity’s accounting policies 
Inventories (note 16)
The Group values inventories at the lower of cost and net realisable value. The net realisable value is based on the judgement of the 
probability that planning consent will be granted for each site. The Group believes that, based on the Directors’ experience, planning 
consent will be given. If planning consent was not achieved then a provision may be required against inventories. The cost value is based 
on actual costs incurred at the date of signing the financial statements with an estimation of costs to complete. The judgement of costs 
to complete is based on the Directors’ experience and if actual plus projected costs are higher than net realisable value then a provision 
would be required against inventories.
Capitalisation of borrowing costs (notes 16 & 29)
The Group capitalises borrowing costs where there is a qualifying asset. The Directors must assess each site held with inventories each 
year in order to judge whether or not the site is a qualifying asset. In prior years all borrowing costs were expensed to the Group Income 
Statement however this year the Wilton Park development and the Cheshunt joint venture were, in the opinion of the Directors, judged 
to be qualifying assets in line with the requirements of IAS 23 Borrowing Costs. This is due to the long term, complex nature of these 
developments which will take several years before parts of it are sold or developed. This has resulted in borrowing costs related to this 
site to be capitalised in the current and prior years. For other sites the Group expenses borrowing costs due to the quantity and repetitive 
nature of the process adopted. In many cases such developments may take longer than 12 months. The Directors are therefore required 
to exercise judgement as to whether or not a site represents a qualifying asset.

Investment in joint ventures (note 14)
The Group’s joint venture investment in Project Helix Holdco Limited (Project Helix) is not in equal share (the Group owns 20% of the 
share capital of Project Helix) however the Group has had joint control over the activities of the company with the other party due to its 
entitlement to veto any decisions. In addition the Group and the other party to the agreement only have rights to the net assets of these 
companies through the terms of the contractual arrangements. Within Project Helix there is a ratchet mechanism which depends on  
the amount of profit each development contributes to the joint venture. Therefore this entity has been classified as a joint venture and  
is accounted for using the equity method.
The Group’s joint venture investments in Bucknalls Developments Limited (Bucknalls), Cheshunt Lakeside Developments Limited 
(formerly Inland (Stonegate) Limited) and Gardiners Park LLP are 50/50 joint ventures and the Group has joint control over the activities  
of the companies with the other parties and has an entitlement to veto any decisions. The Group and the other parties to the agreements 
only have rights to the net assets of these companies through the terms of the contractual arrangements. Within these three joint 
ventures the Group is entitled to 50% of the net assets. Therefore these entities are classified as joint ventures and are accounted for 
using the equity method. 
Investment in associates (note 14)
The Group has a 25% investment in Troy Homes Limited. It has significant influence over that entity but does not have joint control. 
Therefore the investment is classified as an associate and is accounted for using the equity method.
4. Group Income and Segmental Analysis
The Group generates income by way of land sales. It also generates income from housebuilding, contracting, rental income, hotel income, 
investments, investment properties and management fees. These operating segments are monitored and strategic decisions are made  
on the basis of segment operating results. The segmental analysis of operations is as follows:

Included within the ‘Land sales’ segment is land sales to housing associations which include construction works to ‘Golden Brick’. The 
construction works to completion are included in the ‘Contracting income’ segment. 
Included with the ‘Housebuilding’ segment are the sales of freehold reversions and customers’ extras that arise as a by-product of house 
building activity.
Items included within ‘Other’ above do not produce significant income streams and are therefore not monitored separately by the Board, 
but as a group.

12. Investment Properties continued
The different valuation method levels are defined below.
• Level 1: quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
• Level 2: inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices)  
or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices); and
• Level 3: inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs).
These levels are specified in accordance with IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement. Our property valuation approach and process is set out 
within the ‘Valuation and sensitivity’ section of this note below. Property valuations are inherently subjective as they are made on the basis 
of assumptions made by the valuer which may not prove to be accurate. For these reasons we have classified the investment property 
valuations as Level 3 as defined by IFRS 13. 
The Group’s policy is to recognise transfers between fair value hierarchy levels as of the date of the event or change in circumstances  
that caused the transfer. There have been no transfers during the period.
At 30 June 2017, the Group’s investment properties were valued at £53.6 million (2016: £51.7 million) and the historical costs were £15.4 million 
(2016: £15.0 million).
The Poole investment property is pledged as security against the £20 million Barclays RCF. The carrying value of the property is £5.35 million 
(2016: £5.35 million).
The Wilton Park investment properties are pledged as security against a Secure Trust Bank loan. The carrying value of the properties  
is £46.94 million (2016: £45.39 million) and the security value is £45.7 million.
Income and expense
During the year ended 30 June 2017 £1,113,000 (2016: £642,000) rental and ancillary income from investment properties was recognised 
in the Group Income Statement. Direct operating expenses, including repairs and maintenance, arising from investment property that 
generated rental income amounted to £185,000 (2016: £203,000). The Group did not incur any direct operating expenses arising from 
investment properties that did not generate rental income (2016: £nil).
Restrictions and obligations
At 30 June 2017 there were no restrictions on the realisability of investment property or the remittance of income and proceeds of 
disposal (2016: £nil).
There are no obligations to construct or develop the Group’s residential or development land investment property. 
Valuation and sensitivity
Residential
The Group’s residential investment properties were valued by the Directors on the basis of ‘open market value’. In arriving at their view of open 
market value the directors had regard to the following; the accommodation offered, the square footage and the condition of each property. They 
then considered the above in light of the local market and prices achieved in recent transactions in consultation with a local property agent.
If house prices fell by 5% this would result in a reduction in fair value of £2.35 million.
Development
The Group’s development property is carried at fair value which has been established by the Directors using an internal appraisal model 
based on the ‘residual method’. The inputs for this model are the market value of units to be constructed in accordance with the planning 
permission, the costs of any housebuilding, infrastructure, local authority fees and professional fees. The market value of the units has 
been assumed to be at a similar level to the prices obtained by the Group on earlier phases of the same development for similar property 
types. Housebuilding and infrastructure costs have been forecast using costs incurred by the Group on this or other similar developments 
with an allowance for cost increases. Local authority fees were agreed at the time of the signing of the planning permission and are 
therefore known costs. Professional fees are input using costs incurred on similar projects and finance holding costs are the Group’s cost 
of debt capital. Using a profit margin of 20% this generated a land value for the remaining site of £5.35 million. The Directors are of the 
opinion that developing the site reflects the highest and best use of this asset.
As a residual valuation model is used, if house prices were to fall by 5% this would result in a reduction in fair value of £1.3 million in order 
to maintain a profit margin of 20% on the development. If costs should increase by 5% this would result in a reduction in fair value of £1.1 
million in order to maintain the required 20% profit margin.
Commercial
The Group’s commercial property at Leighton Buzzard is carried at fair value which has been established by the Directors using a rental 
yield of 5.5%. The annual rent used in this calculation is the subject of a lease with the Co-op. Costs to complete have been deducted from 
the fair value along with a suitable developer’s margin.
If rental values dropped by 5% the value of this property would decrease by £63,000.

liability relating to the revaluation gains on investment properties due to sufficient capital losses not being available.

During the year, a total of £71,226,000 (2016: £72,329,000) of inventories was included in the Group Income Statement as an expense. The 
Group conducted a review of the net realisable value of its land bank in view of current market conditions. Where the estimated future 
net realisable value of the site is less than the carrying value within the Group Statement of Financial Position, the Group has impaired 
the land value. This has resulted in an impairment of £400,000 (2016: £95,000). The amount of loans and ZDP borrowings secured against 
inventory is £62.1 million (2016: £85.4 million). During the year £1.1 million of interest was capitalised within inventories and there has 
been a prior year adjustment of £0.85 million to 2016 and £0.76 million to 2015.

Ordinary shares
Each share has the right to one vote and is entitled to participate in any distribution made by the Company, including the right to receive  
a dividend.
Deferred shares
Deferred shares shall not confer the right to be paid a dividend or to receive notice of or attend or vote at a general meeting. On a winding-
up, after the distribution of the first £10,000,000 of the assets of the Company, the holders of the deferred shares (if any) shall be entitled 
to receive an amount equal to the nominal value of such deferred shares pro rata to their respective holdings.
ZDP shares
The ZDP shares carry no entitlement to any dividends or other distributions or to participate in the revenue or any other profits of the 
company. The ZDP shareholders have no right to receive notice of, or to attend or vote at, any general meeting of the company except 
in those circumstances set out in the Inland ZDP plc’s Articles of Association, which would be likely to affect their rights or general 
interests.
The Group’s Employee Benefit Trust purchased 643,216 shares on 29 October 2014, 383,850 shares on 20 December 2015 and a further 
600,000 on 16 December 2016 in Inland Homes plc under the terms of the Long Term Incentive Plan. This is a separate entity which is 
consolidated in the Group’s financial statements.
The Company operates an unapproved share option scheme. Awards under each scheme are made periodically to employees. Share options 
vest three years after the date of grant and have an exercise period of seven years from the date of vesting. The schemes are all equity-
settled. The Company has used the Black-Scholes formula to calculate the fair value of outstanding share options and deferred shares. 
The Company also operates a long term incentive plan (2013 LTIP) for the Executive Directors. Further details of this can be found in the 
Directors’ Remuneration Report. The Company has used the Monte Carlo simulation technique to determine the fair value of the grant of 
the awards as the outcome of the performance targets depends on the Parent Company’s share price. 
Volatility was calculated using historical share price information. No share options or Growth Shares were issued in the current year or 
prior year. 
The charge calculated for the year ended 30 June 2017 is £463,000 (2016: £665,000) with a corresponding deferred tax asset at that date  
of £87,000 (2016: £126,000).
Volatility was assessed using the closing prices on the first business day of each month over the period since the shares have been listed.

Notes to the Group Financial Statements 
For the year ended 30 June 2017
23. Contingencies 
During the year ended 30 June 2016, one of the Group’s principal contractors (“the contractor”) experienced significant financial difficulties 
and was put into Administration.  The Group has made a claim to the contractor’s Administrators for £7.2 million in relation to amounts it 
believes it is owed by the contractor.  A counter claim for £11.6 million has been received from the Administrators for various unexplained 
reasons, based on discussions with the contractor. The Administrators have not provided any evidence to support the contractor’s claims and 
the Group will be vigorously defending any claims from the contractor as it believes that contractually they have no merit.  
Inland Homes plc has guaranteed the obligations of certain borrowings of its subsidiaries:
Inland Homes Developments Ltd 20,000,000 
Inland (STB) Ltd 29,250,000 
Inland Property Finance Ltd 13,950,000 
 63,200,000 
All of these subsidiaries are going concerns.
Inland Homes plc has guaranteed the obligations of certain subsidiaries with regards to the payments of subcontractors. As at 30 June 
2017 one guarantee was considered significant by the Group and is in relation to Inland Finance Ltd for a maximum of £805,000. This 
guarantee has expired since the year end.
Inland Homes plc has guaranteed the build performance obligations of Inland Limited and Inland Partnerships Ltd on their contracts with 
housing associations. The Directors do not consider that these guarantees could be called up.
Inland Homes plc has guaranteed the obligations of Poole Investments Limited on its commitments to its associate company, Troy Homes 
Limited. Further information on these commitments can be found in note 14.
No provisions have been made in these financial statements in respect of these contingent liabilities.

Joint ventures & associates
Project Helix Holdco Ltd – the Group is committed to contributing 20% of all costs. The initial agreement has a limit of £41.25 million and 
Inland would be liable for £8.25 million, including what has already been paid.
Bucknalls Developments Ltd – the Group is committed to contributing 50% of all costs. The agreement allowed for the land purchase to 
be funded equally by each side and a contribution of £75,000 from the Group’s joint venture partners towards planning costs. The Group 
is committed to fund anything over this amount, until the site becomes income generating. From the date of the signing of the financial 
statements, the Group expects to contribute a further £200,000 towards planning costs before construction begins. It is anticipated that 
construction will be funded by a bank loan.
Cheshunt Lakeside Developments Ltd – the Group is committed to contributing 50% of all costs. The Group expects to fund a further 
£750,000 before receipt of a planning permission.
Gardiners Park LLP – the Group is committed to contributing 50% of all costs not funded by external borrowings and no further costs  
are expected. 
Troy Homes Ltd – the Group has subscribed to a further £125,000 of loan notes and £1.0m of share capital which are payable when called 
for by the board of Troy.
25. Capital Management Policies and Procedures 
The Group’s objectives when managing capital are:
• to safeguard its ability to continue as a going concern, so that it can continue to provide returns for shareholders and benefits for other 
stakeholders; and
• to ensure sufficient liquid resources are available to meet the funding requirement of its projects and to fund new projects where 
identified.
This is achieved through ensuring sufficient bank and other facilities are in place; further details are given in note 26 to the Group 
accounts. The Group monitors capital on the basis of the carrying amount of the equity less cash and cash equivalents as presented on 
the face of the Group Statement of Financial Position.
The movement in the capital to overall financing ratio is shown below. The target capital to overall financing ratio has been set by the 
Directors at 40% and results over this amount are considered to be a good performance against the target.

The Group manages the capital structure and makes adjustments in light of changes in economic conditions and the risk characteristics 
of the underlying assets. In order to maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group may adjust the level of dividends paid to 
shareholders, return capital to shareholders, issue new shares or sell assets to reduce debt.
Every quarter the Group must report to the ZDP shareholders that the covenants attached to the ZDP shares have not been breached. 
The most significant covenant is the gearing ratio which is calculated as adjusted gross assets: financial indebtedness. This covenant 
is monitored on a bi-monthly basis by the Board and has not been breached at any time. Further details can be found in the Inland ZDP 
Prospectus on the Company’s website at www.inlandhomesplc.com.

Notes to the Group Financial Statements 
For the year ended 30 June 2017
26. Financial Instruments
Financial risk management
The Group’s activities expose it to a variety of financial risks: credit risk; liquidity risk; and interest rate risk. The Group’s overall risk 
management programmes focus on the unpredictability of financial markets and seek to minimise potential adverse effects on the 
Group’s financial performance.
Risk management is carried out centrally under policies approved by the Board of Directors. 
(a) Credit risk
The Group’s significant concentrations of credit risk are its loans to joint ventures and deferred receipts on disposal of investment in 
subsidiaries and joint ventures which are adequately covered by the underlying values of the assets within the joint ventures or legal 
charges over the land within the vehicle disposed of. Further information can be found in notes 14, 17 and 25. It has policies in place to 
ensure that sales of products and services are made to customers with an appropriate credit history.
The Group’s exposure to credit risk is limited to the carrying amount of financial assets recognised at the year end date, as summarised 
below:
2017
£000
2016
£000
Classes of financial assets – carrying amounts
Cash and cash equivalents 26,459  16,723 
Loans to associates due in more than one year 5,763  894 
Amounts due from joint ventures in less than one year 18,267  10,103 
Amounts due from associates in less than one year —  3,372 
Receivables due in more than one year 5,830  55 
Trade and other receivables 21,229  5,921 
 77,548  37,068 
The Group’s policy is to deal with creditworthy counterparties. 
The Group’s management considers that all the above financial assets for each of the reporting dates under review are of good credit 
quality. The Directors consider that none of the receivables are past due or impaired. Further information on the concentration of credit 
risk can be found in note 17 on page 97.
Other forms of credit risk are for liquid funds and other short term financial assets but these are considered negligible, since the 
counterparties are reputable banks with high quality credit ratings.
(b) Liquidity risk
Prudent liquidity risk management implies maintaining sufficient cash balances and ensuring availability of funding through an adequate 
amount of credit facilities. The Group aims to maintain flexibility in funding by keeping credit lines available. The Group also purchases 
property under deferred consideration arrangements. 
(c) Interest rate risk
The Group’s interest rate risk arises from long term borrowings. Borrowings issued at variable rates expose the Group to risk. Most of 
the Group’s borrowings are at variable rates. 
Market rate sensitivity analysis
The analysis below shows the sensitivity of the Group Income Statement and net assets to a 0.5 per cent change in interest rate on the 
Group’s financial instruments that are affected by market risk. These financial instruments consist solely of borrowings.

26. Financial Instruments continued
(d) Price risk
The Group’s price risk arises from the market value of land and house prices. These are affected by credit availability, employment 
levels, interest rates, consumer confidence and the supply of land. Whilst it is not possible for the Group to fully mitigate such risks on a 
macroeconomic basis, the Group does focus its operations in areas that have a favourable supply/demand ratio and ensures that planning 
permissions gained are for units of the type and price point which are less easily affected by any downturns in the housing market. 
The Group has also started entering into construction contracts with Housing Associations which involve the bulk, forward selling of 
residential units and has less risk than speculative building.

Notes to the Group Financial Statements 
For the year ended 30 June 2017
26. Financial Instruments continued
The ZDP shares are carried at their accrued value of 137.55p per share (2016: 129.12p) however their closing price on the main market of 
the London Stock Exchange on 30 June 2017 was 143.75p (2016: 139.00p). The ZDP shares attract an interest rate of between 4.64%–7.3%.
Financial assets and liabilities are measured at fair value in the Group Statement of Financial Position in accordance with the fair value 
hierarchy. This hierarchy groups financial assets and liabilities into three levels, based on the significance of inputs used in measuring the 
fair value of the financial assets and liabilities. The fair value hierarchy has the following levels:
• Level 1: quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
• Level 2: inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices)  
or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices); and
• Level 3: inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs).
The level within which the financial asset or liability is classified is determined based on the lowest level of significant input to the fair 
value measurement.
The financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value in the Group Statement of Financial Position are grouped into the fair value 
hierarchy as follows:

29. Prior Year Adjustments
During the year the Directors reviewed properties held within inventories and are now of the opinion that given the complexity and the 
nature of the developments at Wilton Park and Cheshunt it is more appropriate to capitalise interest in accordance with IAS 23 Borrowing 
Costs in relation to the properties at Wilton Park and in the Cheshunt joint venture. Further information on this assessment can be found 
in notes 1 and 3. A prior year adjustment of £1,298,000 has also been made to recognise an additional deferred tax liability relating to the 
revaluation gains on investment properties following a review of the Group’s capital losses available for set off against future capital gains 
that were erroneously calculated in the prior year. The financial impact of these adjustments is shown below:
