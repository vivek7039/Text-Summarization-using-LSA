STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS USEFUL INFORMATION
www.tateandlyle.com 11 Chairman’s Statement
I am delighted to be making my first annual 
statement to you following my appointment as 
Chairman of Tate & Lyle from 1 April 2017. 
I am passionate about food, having started my career 
as a food scientist, and have remained close to the 
industry ever since. My path has crossed Tate & Lyle’s 
on several occasions during my career and I am very 
excited to join a company that I have long admired for 
its strong heritage, values and expertise. 
I am honoured to succeed Sir Peter Gershon who 
retired on 31 March 2017 after serving on the Board 
for eight years. I would like to thank him sincerely for 
his outstanding service and significant contribution 
to Tate & Lyle during his tenure. Peter leaves the 
Company in great shape, performing well with a 
clear strategy and strong governance. 
I look forward to working with the Board and the 
executive team to realise Tate & Lyle’s potential  
for development, growth and value creation for 
shareholders. 
Delivering for shareholders
I am pleased to report that T ate & Lyle delivered 
excellent performance in the year ended 31 March 2017 
with profits and earnings per share both well ahead 
of the prior year. Cash generation was particularly 
strong and the balance sheet remains robust, 
providing flexibility to support future growth whilst 
maintaining dividend distribution to shareholders. 
The Board recognises the importance to our 
shareholders not only of the dividend, but also  
of its sustainability, and the need to re-build cash 
dividend cover over time. Accordingly, the Board 
recommends an unchanged final dividend for the 
year ended 31 March 2017 of 19.8p to make an 
unchanged total for the year of 28.0p. Looking to the 
future, as dividend cover is re-built, we remain 
committed to a progressive policy of growing the 
dividend over time, taking into account the earnings 
prospects and investment needs of the business.
Delivering responsibly 
Tate & Lyle is committed to achieving strong 
performance for shareholders whilst maintaining a 
sharp and relentless focus on the safety and 
sustainability of our business. 
In January, we launched an extensive Group-wide 
review of all our safety processes and procedures, 
supported by an independent external expert 
consultancy with deep experience in global safety 
assessments. This follows an industrial accident at 
one of our grain elevators in the US, in September 
2016, when sadly one of our employees and a local 
farmer died. A number of significant management 
actions have already been implemented in our US 
grain elevator network to strengthen safety 
processes, further explained in the Corporate 
Responsibility section on page 44.
We expect the external review will conclude in the 
first half of the current financial year. The Board and 
the executive team will work together to ensure that 
the review’s findings are carefully considered and 
recommended actions implemented 
comprehensively and with urgency. Our ultimate 
goal remains to have no accidents and no injuries 
and this incident has made us all the more 
determined to build a safer Tate & Lyle for all our 
employees, contractors and visitors. There is no 
higher priority in the Group.
 A year of 
excellent 
progress
Dr Gerry Murphy, Chairman
Tate & Lyle delivered a strong 
performance with impressive 
financial results
12 Tate & Lyle PLC Annual Report 2017 Four years ago, Tate & Lyle set itself ambitious 
sustainability targets to reduce the environmental 
impact of the business. We achieved our targets for 
packaging and sustainable agriculture and at the 
end of March 2017 we had exceeded our 2016 CO
2
e 
emissions target. We also achieved a leadership 
position of A- in the CDP (formerly the Carbon 
Disclosure Project). Building on these achievements, 
we have set ourselves new stretching targets for 
2020 (full details on page 48).
Our commitment to the United Nations (UN) 
Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) remains  
a key part of our sustainability agenda. A key 
objective for the year ahead is the acceleration  
of our progress towards the UN SDG targets.
Governance and Board composition 
There have been a number of changes to the  
Board since the last AGM. I joined the Board on 
1 January 2017, succeeding Sir Peter Gershon  
as Chairman on 1 April 2017. Liz Airey retired as 
Senior Independent Director on 31 December 2016 
and, after 10 years of service, will retire from the 
Board at the AGM in July 2017. Douglas Hurt 
assumed the role of Senior Independent Director 
from 1 January 2017, in addition to his role as 
chairman of the Audit Committee. William Camp 
stepped down as a Non-Executive Director and 
chairman of the Corporate Responsibility Committee 
on 31 March 2017, having served on the Board since 
2010. On behalf of the Board, I would like to thank 
both Liz and William for their outstanding service 
and significant contribution both to the Board and  
to Tate & Lyle.
In October 2016, Jeanne Johns joined the Board  
as a Non-Executive Director. Jeanne assumed 
chairmanship of the Corporate Responsibility 
Committee on 1 April 2017 and is also a member  
of the Nominations and Remuneration Committees. 
During her 30-year career in the oil industry with  
BP , Jeanne held numerous leadership roles in 
Europe, the US and China and latterly served as the 
Head of Safety and Operational Risk for BP’s global 
downstream business.
I look forward to working with the 
Board and the executive team to 
realise Tate & Lyle’s potential for 
development, growth and value 
creation for shareholders. 
Summary 
Tate & Lyle has performed well this year and I would 
like to thank our management team and employees 
for all the hard work, dedication and skill essential 
to this success. Since my appointment to the Board, 
I have already visited a number of the Group’s 
facilities in North America and Europe and look 
forward to seeing some of our sites in Asia and 
Latin America in the coming months. I have been 
impressed by the unwavering passion, enthusiasm 
and commitment of all the colleagues I have met. 
Like many global businesses, we are facing an 
evolving and challenging geopolitical landscape, but 
we do so with confidence as a strong and financially 
solid company. I am excited about Tate & Lyle’s 
future. With our clear strategy, strong product 
portfolio and outstanding people, we are well-
positioned for continuing and sustainable growth.

with volume growth in all regions except North 
America where growth remained challenging. 
SPLENDA
®
 Sucralose’s adjusted operating profit was 
£30 million higher as it benefited from lower costs 
from a single production facility and a one-off 
inventory sell-down. Food Systems’ adjusted 
operating profit was £19 million lower with a 
significant decline in Europe where sales were 
constrained by a consolidation of our blending sites, 
which took longer than expected, and a credit issue 
which restricted access to the Russian market. 
Sales of New Products, which represent products in 
the first seven years after launch, grew by 22% in 
the year. Sales from New Products have grown by a 
compound average growth rate of 43% over the past 
five years.
Bulk Ingredients had a particularly strong year  
with adjusted operating profit increasing by 54% 
(32% in constant currency) at £129 million. This 
performance was driven by strong commercial 
execution, good US bulk sweetener demand, robust 
margins, and solid manufacturing performance 
across the plant network. The relatively well-
balanced North American corn wet milling industry 
also benefited the business.
Our joint-venture businesses performed well with 
profits 16% higher at £32 million. 
Adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing 
operations increased by 37% (16% in constant 
currency) to 47.1p.
Overview of Group performance
Tate & Lyle delivered a strong performance in  
the year. Both business divisions delivered profit 
growth with Bulk Ingredients delivering particularly 
good results, driven by excellent commercial 
execution and solid manufacturing performance.
Adjusted profit before tax increased by 40% (20% in 
constant currency) to £271 million. Movements in 
foreign currencies, especially the strength of the US 
dollar against sterling, increased adjusted profit 
before tax by £40 million.
Speciality Food Ingredients performed well with 
adjusted profit up 21% (5% in constant currency) at 
£181 million. The business, excluding SPLENDA
®
 
Sucralose and Food Systems, delivered an increase in 
adjusted operating profit of 8% in constant currency, 
We continue to perform well and to 
build a stronger business

Key highlights
• Strong Group financial and operational  
performance
• Bulk Ingredients delivered particularly 
good results
• Speciality Food Ingredients performed well,

• Strong balance sheet and cash generation
• Improving dividend cover
• Continued progress towards 2020 Ambition
Delivering on

STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS USEFUL INFORMATION
www.tateandlyle.com 15 Chief Executive’s Review continued
Cash generation during the year was excellent. Adjusted free 
cash flow was more than three times higher than the prior 
year, and more than covered the dividend. Net debt was 
£18 million higher at £452 million, with a £57 million adverse 
impact from foreign exchange translation offsetting the strong 
free cash flow generation.
Overall, the Group’s performance in the year was extremely 
encouraging. With both divisions performing well, higher 
operating margins, and a robust balance sheet, the Group is 
well positioned for the future. 
Strategic progress
We have a clear corporate strategy which we have executed 
against in a disciplined way since the 2011 financial year – to 
focus on growing Speciality Food Ingredients supported by 
steady earnings from Bulk Ingredients. During the year we 
continued to make good progress against this strategy.
Consumers across the world are increasingly looking for 
healthier nutrition, particularly given the rising incidence of 
obesity and diabetes worldwide. Our Speciality Food 
Ingredients business is well-placed to help our customers 
meet these demands, as our ingredients help to reduce sugar, 
calories and fat, and also to add fibre, in consumer products. 
We are steadily bringing new products to market to address 
these consumer trends, both through in-house innovation and 
by establishing strategic partnerships. During the year, we 
expanded our range of texturants with the launch of CLARIA
®
 
Bliss, a clean-label starch which provides great taste and 
texture to products such as dairy desserts and chilled ready 
meals. We also developed our sweetener range with a new 
crystalline version of DOLCIA PRIMA
®
 Allulose, a rare sugar 
with a similar taste and texture to sucrose but only a very small 
fraction of the calories. Overall, we invested £37 million in 
research and development in the year, an increase of £8 million, 
part of which was driven by foreign currency translation. 
In March 2017, we announced an exclusive partnership with 
Sweet Green Fields, one of the largest fully integrated global 
stevia players, to distribute their innovative stevia ingredients, 
and bring their leading stevia-based sweetening solutions to 
our customers worldwide. Early customer interest in our 
expanded stevia offering has been encouraging.
We continue to see strong growth in emerging markets.  
During the year, we increased our applications and technical 
service resources in Latin America and Asia Pacific, and  
our sales and applications resources in the Middle East.  
Our vision and strategy 
Our vision is to become a leading global provider of 
speciality food ingredients and solutions. 
Our strategy is to deliver this vision through:
• A disciplined focus on growing our Speciality Food 
Ingredients business
 – deeper customer engagement
 – continuous innovation
 – stronger positions in higher-growth markets
• Driving Bulk Ingredients for sustained cash 
generation to fuel this growth.

Driving efficient operations
We manage Bulk Ingredients for steady earnings. In the mature 
markets this division operates in, we aim to deliver this by: 
• optimising product mix and margins
• maintaining capital expenditure discipline
• continuously driving productivity and efficiency
• maintaining a mix of tolling and non-tolling contracts
• reducing exposure to commodity markets where we can, by 
dampening volatility by using conservative hedging strategies; 
actively managing co-product sales; and investing in the corn 
elevator storage network to secure raw material supply.
16 Tate & Lyle PLC Annual Report 2017 Main product lines
Bulk Ingredients main product lines largely serve 
mature and consolidated markets.
Bulk sweeteners
Bulk sweeteners provide sweetness and 
mouthfeel to regular carbonated soft drinks, 
confectionery and other foods and drinks.
Industrial starches
Industrial starches strengthen and improve the 
surface conditions of paper and cardboard and 
are also used in adhesives for building products. 
Acidulants
Acidulants are used mainly to enhance flavour 
and preserve foods, beverages and 
pharmaceuticals. 
Commodities
Commodities include co-products such as corn 
gluten meal and corn gluten feed (sold mainly as 
animal feed) and corn oil. 
We also produce some ethanol at our Loudon, 
Tennessee facility as a means of optimising the 
production balance and efficiency.
Key market factors
Industry capacity utilisation
Our bulk ingredients are produced mainly at four 
large corn wet mills in the US and two smaller mills 
in Europe. Supply/demand balance is a key driver of 
profitability in the US corn wet milling industry and 
the industry was well balanced in the year . 
Corn market
The US corn wet milling industry processes around 
10% of the US corn crop. Recent harvests have been 
strong with corn inventory high and prices relatively 
low and stable. Corn is largely a pass-through cost.
Carbonated soft drinks
Demand in the US for regular carbonated soft 
drinks, the main end-market for our bulk 
sweeteners, declined by 0.7%
1
 in the year. 
Re-deploying capacity
We seek to manage the long-term gradual decline 
in demand for our bulk ingredients by steadily 
re-deploying primary capacity in our corn wet mills 
to support growth in Speciality Food Ingredients.
Global consumer trends
The market for speciality food ingredients is 
being driven by a number of global 
consumer trends.
Healthier
With obesity and diabetes on the rise worldwide, 
consumers are looking to reduce calories, sugar 
and fat, while also adding beneficial ingredients 
to food and drink such as fibre and protein.
‘Clean-label’
Consumers want to understand the ingredients 
on food and drink labels. Increasingly, they are 
choosing products with labels with ingredients 
that they feel are less processed, or they perceive 
to be simpler or ‘natural’.
‘Free from’
Intolerance to certain ingredients is leading to 
increased demand for allergen-free foods such 
as gluten-free and dairy-free.
‘On the go’
People have busy lives and sometimes 
convenience can come at the cost of healthy 
nutrition. Consumers are demanding food and 
drink that offers fast, ‘grab-and-go’ nutrition,  
but which also makes it easier to make 
healthier choices.
Meeting consumer demand
Our ingredients and solutions help our customers 
meet growing consumer demand for healthier 
food and drink. We leverage our deep technical 
expertise and understanding of categories such as 
dairy and beverages to provide our customers with 
the solutions they need. 
Sugar and calorie reduction
Through our wide portfolio of speciality 
sweeteners and fibres, we create solutions that 
reduce sugar and calories without compromising 
the sweetness and texture consumers want. 
Enrichment
Our diverse portfolio of fibres offers a range of 
nutritional and functional benefits – from fibre 
enrichment to sugar and calorie reduction – 
while delivering exceptional digestive tolerance.
Texture
Our range of starches provides key functionality 
for foods such as thickening, shelf-stability and 
fat reduction, while still providing the texture 
consumers want.
Stabilisation
Through our in-depth knowledge of ingredients 
and complex food systems, we create customised 
stabiliser systems (highly functional ingredient 
blends) that ensure products maintain stability 
and appetising texture throughout their shelf life.

our applications laboratory in Singapore. This facility will 
provide customers with access to more sophisticated analytical 
equipment and services, including pilot-plant scale food-
processing equipment, to enable them to perform product 
trials on site.
Significant benefits have been realised from the re-alignment  
of the SPLENDA
®
 Sucralose business we undertook in the prior 
year. The implementation of a rigorous value-based approach to 
securing volume, and the consolidation of production into a single 
facility in Alabama, US, has helped to increase profitability and 
position sucralose as a more focused, low-cost and sustainable 
business. During the year, we also celebrated the 40
th
 anniversary 
of the discovery of sucralose. This ingredient has helped to 
reshape the global sweetener landscape by enabling our 
customers to create a wide range of great-tasting, low-calorie 
foods and beverages for consumers. Since its discovery in 1976, 
the amount of SPLENDA
®
 Sucralose produced by Tate & Lyle has 
been enough to replace over 19 million tonnes of sugar in the 
human diet, which is the equivalent of removing 77 trillion 
calories from consumers’ diets globally.
Food Systems had a challenging year as we worked through 
some key changes. In Europe, we consolidated our blending 
facilities from three sites to two to lower our cost base going 
forward. We also refocused our site in Germany on applications 
and solutions development for customers. In China, we decided 
to simplify our go-to-market approach by selling our interest in 
Jiangsu Tate & Lyle Howbetter Food Co., Ltd. back to our 
partner. Together, these actions will allow Food Systems to 
serve its customers better and re-position the business for 
future growth. 
Bulk Ingredients had a very strong year. The decision and steps 
taken in 2015 to re-align our European business and focus 
Bulk Ingredients predominantly on the relatively more stable 
North American market have served us well. Our objective is 
for Bulk Ingredients to deliver steady earnings from the core 
business and to dampen volatility in Commodities, and we 
continue to take the necessary actions to prosecute this 
strategy. We have evolved our operating model to provide a 
greater focus on product mix and margin management, and we 
remain focused on tight cost control. We continue to invest in 
our plant network for long-term efficiency gains, and to drive 
productivity across our broader supply chain network.
Progress against 2020 Ambition
In November 2015, we communicated our 2020 Ambition to 
further strengthen our business with three key outcomes.  
Our progress against this ambition is set out opposite. By way 
of summary:
• 54% of the Group’s adjusted operating profit came from 
Speciality Food Ingredients. While profits from Speciality Food 
Ingredients are growing broadly in line with our expectations, 
profits from Bulk Ingredients are well ahead of our 
expectations. The very strong performance by Bulk 
Ingredients in the year has resulted in the overall percentage 
of profits from Speciality Food Ingredients being lower than 
last year.
• Speciality Food Ingredients sales from Asia Pacific and Latin 
America grew by 6% in constant currency and have 
increased to 23% of the core business’s sales. 
• We continue to see good momentum from New Products with 
sales of US$105 million, 22% higher than last year.

As reported in our half-year results announcement, we have 
launched an extensive Group-wide review of our safety 
processes and procedures, supported by an independent 
external expert consultancy with deep experience in global 
safety assessments. This follows an industrial accident at one 
of our grain elevators in the US in September 2016 when sadly 
one of our employees and a local farmer died. We expect the 
review will conclude in the first half of the 2018 financial year.
For the 2016 calendar year, in relation to our two main 
safety-related key performance indicators, the Recordable 
Incident rate remained at 0.76 and the Lost-work Case rate 
improved from 0.16 to 0.11. Fatalities are recorded separately 
and are not included in these rates.
People
Our employees across Tate & Lyle bring a huge amount of 
energy and passion to work every day, and I would like to thank 
them for their hard work and dedication. Our strong 
performance this year is a testament to the talent and the 
commitment of our people and I look forward to working with 
them in the next financial year as we continue to execute 
our strategy.
Outlook
Turning to the outlook, we are confident the Group will continue 
to make underlying progress in the 2018 financial year.
Summary
Overall, our results for the 2017 financial year reflect strong 
delivery against our strategy and towards our 2020 Ambition.  
I remain very encouraged by our progress, as we continue to 
build a stronger business with higher-quality earnings, capable 
of delivering sustainable long-term growth.

www.tateandlyle.com 21 Business Model
How our business works
Our business model is evolving as we implement our strategy to  
grow Speciality Food Ingredients supported by steady earnings from 
Bulk Ingredients. As we deliver this strategy, we are becoming an 
increasingly customer-focused and innovation-driven business 
supported by a strong manufacturing base.
How we create value
Our ingredients and solutions are valuable because they are highly functional. They help to reduce sugar, calories and fat, as well 
as add taste, texture and nutrition to products consumed by millions of people every day. The revenue from the sale of our 
ingredients and solutions generates cash flow which, after meeting our costs, helps fund business investments, meet our debt 
obligations, and provide returns to shareholders through dividends.
Generating value 
and delivering 
shareholder 
returns
Scale  
manufacturing
Most of our ingredients are made 
from agricultural crops, mainly 
corn. They are mainly produced at 
large-volume corn wet mills (shared  
by both divisions) and smaller 
blending facilities. Safety, quality, 
traceability and environmental 
impact are all high priorities in our 
raw material sourcing and 
production process. 
Local customer  
solutions 
Consumer taste and texture 
preferences are different across 
the world, which is why we have a 
global network of application 
labs. Customers come to our 
labs to work with our food 
scientists to reformulate their 
products using our ingredients 
for their local markets.  
Innovation
Our team of scientists and 
nutritionists continuously 
research and test ingredients 
to create solutions for our 
customers. We work closely 
with our customers to 
understand their needs. 
Engaging with them earlier 
and throughout the innovation 
process helps drive quicker 
adoption cycles.
Consumer insight
We use our expertise in areas  
such as sensory, culinary and 
marketing to obtain a deep 
understanding of what the 
consumer wants. This insight 
drives our product development 
programme, and how  
we collaborate with 
our customers.
Delivering to  
customers
We aim to deliver our ingredients  
to customers on time, in full and to  
the right specification. For Speciality 
Food Ingredients, this is a complex 
process with multiple ingredients and 
formulations travelling around  
the world. For Bulk Ingredients, 
volumes are larger but products  
travel relatively shorter  
distances to customers.
22 Tate & Lyle PLC Annual Report 2017 What drives us
Our goal is to deliver sweet taste, texture, fibre enrichment and stabilisation in food and drink, focusing on sugar, calorie 
and fat reduction. To do this, we focus our resources and investments on those categories which have strong growth 
potential, where we have strong functional expertise, and where we have the potential to steadily build our competitive 
advantage over time. These categories include beverages, dairy and soups, sauces and dressings. Our speciality food 
ingredients and solutions are highly relevant because they help meet growing consumer, customer and societal needs for 
healthier food and drink in the face of growing global levels of obesity and diabetes, and digestive health issues.
What makes us different
We have a number of strengths which, in combination, differentiate us in the market. 
What underpins our business
Safety
We have no higher priority than 
the safety of our people and have 
an extensive safety management 
programme in place. We 
measure safety performance at 
every site monthly. 
Values
Our Values define what we stand 
for and how we behave with our 
customers, suppliers, investors, 
partners, the communities in 
which we operate, and 
each other.
Board oversight
The Board of Directors oversees 
the activities of the Group through 
regular meetings, its four 
committees and visits to our 
operations around the globe.
  Read more on page 44  Read more on page 42  Read more on page 57
Leading functional 
expertise 
We have strong technical 
expertise in the cross-section of 
sweetness, texture and fibre 
enrichment, through our leading 
portfolio of sweeteners, highly 
functional speciality starches, 
and fibres with specific 
nutritional and health benefits.
Deep category 
understanding
Through our teams of food 
scientists, nutritionists and other 
experts, we have an increasingly 
deep understanding globally and 
locally of the categories we focus 
on such as beverages, dairy and 
soups, sauces and dressings.
Delivering tailored 
solutions 
The combination of our strong 
innovation pipeline and the 
blending expertise of our Food 
Systems business, enables us to 
deliver tailored solutions for our 
customers which meet growing 
consumer demand for healthier 
food and drink.
Talented people 
Our people are passionate, 
dedicated and highly skilled. We 
invest in training and developing 
our employees and also recruit 
high-calibre talent to ensure we 
have the right people, teams and 
skills to grow our business.
Clear focus for bulk 
business
A key driver of our success is our 
clear focus on delivering steady 
earnings from the large 
businesses within Bulk 
Ingredients – bulk sweeteners, 
industrial starches and 
acidulants. The cash they 
generate is used to fuel growth in 
Speciality Food Ingredients.
Global 
manufacturing base
Our scale manufacturing base 
and know-how enables us to 
drive operational efficiencies and 
a high level of product quality.  
They also provide a cost effective 
supply of ingredients for 
distribution through our global 
supply chain.

Good performance with profit growth and margin expansion in the 
core business
Overview
Adjusted operating profit grew 5% in constant currency as we 
drove better product mix and improved margins in the core 
business and SPLENDA
® 
Sucralose performance benefited 
from the consolidation of its manufacturing footprint completed 
at the end of the prior year, and the sell-down of excess 
inventory. Food Systems’ adjusted operating profit declined 
sharply to £4 million, with sales constrained by both lower 
volume in Europe following the consolidation of our blending 
facilities to lower our long-term cost base, which took longer 
than expected, and the management of a credit issue that 
restricted our access to the Russian market.
The division delivered 150bps operating margin improvement, 
driven by good growth in the core business and strong 
SPLENDA
® 
Sucralose performance. 
The effect of currency translation was to increase sales by 
£122 million and adjusted operating profit by £23 million.
Key highlights
• Good performance overall, with adjusted operating 
profit 5% higher in constant currency
• Core business performed well, despite continued 
weaker performance in North America
• Food Systems had a difficult year, with a significant 
decline in Europe
• SPLENDA

 Sucralose and Food Systems
Volume grew by 2%, with particularly good growth in Europe, 
Middle East and Africa, which benefited from the acquisition of 
the Slovakian facility. On a like-for-like basis, volume was 
1% lower.
Adjusted operating profit increased by 8% in constant currency 
to £125 million, benefiting from strong commercial execution 
and good supply chain performance.
In North America, volume was 3% lower driven by softer 
demand in the overall US food and beverage market which 
continued to be sluggish in the year. In this region, we have a 
relatively high concentration of larger customers, and the 
softness these customers are experiencing in the current 
market environment, driven by lower consumer demand for 
their products, has more than offset new business we secured. 
As a consequence, we continue to pursue a longer-term shift in 
our business by evolving our go-to-market approach to focus 
more on higher-growth sub-categories which benefit from our 
expertise in sugar and calorie reduction, and fibre enrichment. 
In the health and nutrition category for example, we have 
selectively targeted sub-categories including energy and 
nutrition bars, where we grew volume by 9% in the year. In 
those areas where we believe we can accelerate progress, we 
are investing in sales, applications, technical service, and 
nutrition resources. The new business we are securing gives us 
confidence in our ability, over time, to grow ahead of the US 
market, and we expect to make progress against this goal as 
we move through the 2018 financial year.
In Asia Pacific and Latin America, volume was 2% higher 
reflecting strong performance in the wider Asia Pacific region 
and double-digit growth in Latin America somewhat offset by 
lower sweetener sales in Japan. Sales were 6% higher in 
constant currency. In Asia Pacific, excluding Japan, our

increasing global consumer trends for 
healthier food and drink.”

President, Speciality Food Ingredients
business continued to grow strongly especially in China, 
benefiting from the investment in local commercial and 
technical capability over recent years. In Brazil, weak economic 
conditions and weak consumer offtake resulted in volume 
softness but this was more than offset by broad-based growth 
across the rest of the Latin American region. Our Latin 
American business is well positioned for further growth despite 
the continued weak macroeconomic conditions in Brazil.
In Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA), volume increased by 
14% benefiting from good growth in the speciality sweetener 
business largely driven by the full ownership of the Slovakian 
facility from November 2015. Excluding the impact of this 
acquisition, EMEA delivered low single-digit volume growth 
with particular strength in our fibres portfolio. 
Food Systems
In our global blending business, volumes were 8% lower largely 
reflecting weakness in Europe, where performance was 
impacted by two issues. Firstly, the continued management of a 
credit exposure to a large customer materially restricted our 
access to the Russian market. This credit issue is now closed 
and we are starting to sell product in Russia again. Secondly, 
the consolidation of our European blending sites, which took 
longer than anticipated, held back production and constrained 
sales. The consolidation is now complete and will reduce our 
cost base in Europe going forward.
These European issues affected performance, with adjusted 
operating profit 82% lower (84% lower in constant currency) at 
£4 million. Included in the profit for the year is a one-off charge 
of £5 million in respect of the provision against receivables 
related to the European credit issue. 
In the first half, we executed a change to our Food Systems 
go-to-market approach in China to allow us to better serve 
customers and maximise our potential in that market. As a 
result we agreed to sell our interest in Jiangsu Tate & Lyle 
Howbetter Food Co., Ltd. back to our partner. We have 
recognised an exceptional charge of £7 million in respect of 
this investment.
We also recognised a net £13 million exceptional charge in 
respect of our Brazilian Food Systems business, Tate & Lyle 
Gemacom (Gemacom). The charge comprises an impairment 
of goodwill, reflecting lower growth expectations against the 
backdrop of a significantly weakened macroeconomic outlook 
in Brazil, partially offset by a reduction in contingent 
consideration payable. Gemacom remains an important part of 
our global Food Systems business, with high-quality assets 
and a strong market position.
Looking forward, with the benefits of our restructuring, we 
expect performance to improve over the course of the 2018 
financial year.

A customer in Asia wanted to launch a 
drink product that would appeal to a 
younger market. Our application 
scientists got to work and developed a 
new concept – a jelly drink. The drink 
contained a customised stabiliser system 
which provided unique functionality –  
it starts as a liquid when served at an 
ambient temperature and gels as it is 
chilled. This enabled our customer to 
launch a new line of drinks into the kids’

to £52 million, benefiting from better than expected pricing  
and the sale of excess inventory in the first half following the 
successful transition to a single manufacturing facility in 
McIntosh, Alabama. The second half saw the full benefit from 
significantly lower production costs at our single facility.  
As anticipated, after a strong start to the year, volume declined 
by 12% in the second half in line with our lower production 
capacity. As a result, volume for the full year was lower by 5%.
The rate of decline of selling prices for SPLENDA
®
 Sucralose 
slowed, resulting in better pricing than expected during the 
year with favourable spot prices being secured in the first half 
for the sale of the excess inventory, and with a benefit from 
contracting in the second half. We continued to pursue a 
rigorous value-based approach by focusing on those customers 
who fully value the benefits of our quality and customer 
service offering.
In our 2018 financial year, with our business largely contracted, 
we expect the full-year benefit of lower costs to offset lower 
volumes. Looking further ahead, while the market for 
sucralose is expected to continue to grow, industry capacity 
remains in excess of demand and therefore we expect further 
pricing pressure in the market.
New Products
New Products, representing products in the first seven years 
after launch, continued to perform strongly. Volume of New 
Products grew by 37%, with sales increasing by 22%. Sales of 
New Products exceeded US$100 million for the first time, 
reaching US$105 million (or £81 million), with sales growth 
across all three platforms of sweeteners, texturants (where 
non-GMO starches grew strongly), and health and wellness. 
Since we opened our global Commercial and Food Innovation 
Centre in Chicago in 2012, New Product sales have delivered a 
43% compound annual growth rate, demonstrating the quality 
of our innovation pipeline.
Innovation is a key enabler of long-term growth, and our focus 
continues to be on delivering innovative new products and 
solutions which meet customer and consumer needs in areas 
such as sugar and calorie reduction, ‘clean-label’ texturants, 
and fibre enrichment. These can be breakthrough innovations 
or incremental extensions to existing product families.  
For example, during the year we further expanded our 
sweetener range with MULTIVANTAGE
®
 Syrup, a low-sugar,  
low-viscosity sweetener, as well as adding a crystalline format 
of DOLCIA PRIMA
® 
Allulose. We also extended our range of 
‘clean-label’ texturants with the launch of CLARIA
® 
Bliss

.
Our focus continues to be on 
delivering innovative new products 
and solutions which meet 
customer and consumer needs in 
areas such as sugar and calorie 
reduction, texture and 
fibre enrichment.
In March 2017, we entered into an exclusive partnership with 
Sweet Green Fields (SGF), one of the largest fully integrated 
global stevia players, to distribute their innovative stevia 
ingredients and bring their leading stevia-based sweetening 
solutions to our customers around the world, alongside our 
existing TASTEVA
®
 Stevia offering. The partnership combines 
our sweetener expertise and global sales and distribution 
network with SGF’s leading portfolio of stevia-based 
ingredients and integrated stevia supply chain. Sales of SGF’s 
stevia ingredients and stevia-based sweetening solutions will 
be reported in New Products sales.

• Solid demand across the portfolio
• Strong commercial execution 
• Robust margins with industry well balanced
• Performance underpinned by good 
manufacturing performance 
Overview
Volume increased by 3% driven by industrial starch growth and 
the acquisition of 100% of the Slovakian facility in the prior year. 
North American bulk sweetener volume was flat. Overall, 
volume on a like-for-like basis was flat. Sales for the division 
increased by 4% in constant currency to £1,757 million.
Adjusted operating profit was 32% higher in constant currency 
at £129 million, benefiting from good commercial and 
operational execution across the business and robust margins. 
Commodities contributed profits of £8 million, an increase of 
£17 million in the year. Operating margin for the division 
strengthened by 150bps. 
The effect of exchange translation was to increase sales by 
£239 million and adjusted operating profit by £18 million. 
The US corn wet milling industry remains well balanced, 
reflecting capacity reductions in the industry at the beginning 
of 2015 and more robust industry exports to Mexico where 
demand for regular carbonated soft drinks remained firm and 
sugar prices are relatively high at present.
Strong profit performance driven by commercial and operational 
execution, good demand and robust margins 
30 Tate & Lyle PLC Annual Report 2017 We continue to position our Bulk Ingredients business in North 
America to deliver steady earnings over the longer term. We 
have adopted a product line approach to further increase our 
focus on product mix management and lower costs across the 
supply chain. We have also established a dedicated team to 
generate continuous process improvements within the plant 
network. We continue to look for ways to further improve the 
longer-term efficiency of our plants, with the new combined 
heat and power facility in Loudon, Tennessee, which was 
brought into use in the third quarter of the financial year, being 
an example. Commercial execution continues to strengthen, 
with stronger customer service driven from improved demand 
forecasting and supply chain decision-making which has been 
supported by the implementation of our global SAP system.
Corn prices
For the third consecutive year the corn harvest was strong, with 
the autumn 2016 harvest setting a production record at 
15.1 billion bushels
1
, and US corn inventories increasing to 
their highest levels in the past 30 years. Three consecutive 
strong harvests have led to a period of sustained lower US corn 
prices with market prices trading below $4.00 per bushel for 
the majority of the financial year. The stocks-to-use ratio for 
the US market for 2016/2017 is estimated at 16%, reflecting 
inventories around one third higher being carried into the 
2017/2018 corn year.
North American Sweeteners
North American bulk sweetener volume was flat, despite a 
modest decline in consumption, driven by strong commercial 
execution and the benefit of strong demand in Mexico.
Consumption of regular carbonated soft drinks is the main 
driver of high fructose corn syrup demand in the US. In the year 
ended 31 March 2017, US regular carbonated soft drinks 
consumption declined by only 0.7%
2
, a slightly slower decline 
than the historical trend. 
Unit margins for contracts renewed for the 2016 calendar year 
increased, benefiting from continued good industry supply 
demand balance following capacity reductions. Our unit 
margins further benefited from mix improvements from our 
product line focus and manufacturing and supply chain 
efficiencies. Contracts renewed for the 2017 calendar year 
contracting round delivered modestly higher unit margins, 
benefiting the fourth quarter of the 2017 financial year. 
North American Industrial Starches
North American industrial starches volume was 3% higher , 
somewhat ahead of underlying market growth. Demand for paper 
and board remained steady , as continued higher packaging and 
tissue demand offset a decline in demand for printing and writing 
paper . Demand for starches used in building materials has been 
robust in a relatively stable US housing market.
Commodities
Co-product values in the US have stabilised towards the low 
end of historical price levels. Strong recent production of corn 
and soybeans has sustained large year-to-year inventory 
carryover of both products and kept prices for both grains and 
co-products relatively stable. US ethanol margins remained 
relatively steady at the low end of the historical range during 
the year.
Commodities overall reported a profit of £8 million, an increase 
of £17 million from the 2016 financial year. The higher profits 
from Commodities were driven by better market demand for 
proteins, including corn gluten meal. Ethanol performance was 
largely flat.
US political environment
The new US Administration is seeking to reform the North 
American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). NAFTA is very 
important to the US food and agricultural sector, and Mexico in 
particular is a key export market for the corn wet milling 
industry, particularly for high fructose corn syrup. Until we have 
clarity on the nature of any proposed changes, it is difficult to 
estimate what the impact, if any, will be.

Group Financial Results
STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS USEFUL INFORMATION
www.tateandlyle.com 33 Group Financial Results continued
Sales from continuing operations of £2,753 million were 17% 
higher than the prior year (2% higher at constant currency). 
Adjusted operating profit from continuing operations increased 
by 40% (18% at constant currency) to £264 million with profits 
ahead in both divisions.
Adjusted profit before tax from continuing operations was 40% 
higher than last year (20% at constant currency), increasing to 
£271 million. Adjusted diluted earnings per share from 
continuing operations increased by 12.6p to 47.1p.
On a statutory basis, profit before tax from continuing 
operations increased by £107 million to £233 million. Statutory 
diluted earnings per share from continuing operations 
increased by 28.3p to 54.2p reflecting improved operating 
performance, lower operating exceptional items and a tax 
credit in the year driven by exceptional tax items (2016 – tax 
charge). Profit for the year from total operations increased to 
£256 million (2016 – £163 million) with the prior year benefiting 
from a £42 million profit for the year from discontinued 
operations which included £62 million of profit after tax in 
respect of disposed elements of the Eaststarch joint venture 
and the Moroccan subsidiary.
Central costs 
Central costs, which include head office costs, treasury and 
reinsurance activities, of £46 million were in line with the  
prior year. 
Net finance expense
Adjusted net finance expense from continuing operations, which 
excludes net retirement benefit interest, was £2 million higher at 
£25 million, principally reflecting steps taken to extend the 
weighted average maturity of debt as proceeds from the 
drawdown of the Group’s US$400 million private debt, with a 
blended fixed rate notes coupon of around 4%, were used to repay 
short-term commercial paper in October 2015. 
The Group repaid a US$250 million bond on its maturity in June 
2016. 
Share of profit after tax of joint ventures  
and associates
The Group’s share of profit after tax of joint ventures and 
associates of £32 million was £4 million higher than in the prior 
year reflecting strong underlying performance at both Almex in 
Mexico (due to strong demand for bulk sweeteners) and our 
Bio-PDO joint venture in the US. 
Exceptional items from continuing operations
During the year, the Group recognised a net exceptional charge 
of £19 million within continuing operations. Included in 
exceptional costs were net impairment charges totalling 
£26 million. The Group incurred a net £13 million charge in 
respect of the Group’s Brazilian Food Systems business, 
Gemacom, reflecting lower growth expectations against the 
backdrop of a weaker macroeconomic outlook in Brazil. The 
Group also incurred a £7 million charge in respect of exiting 
our interest in Jiangsu Tate & Lyle Howbetter Food Co., Ltd. in 
China together with a £6 million charge in respect of the 
impairment of certain redundant assets at our Decatur facility 
in the US.
Also included in exceptional charges was a £9 million non-cash 
gain in respect of the settlement of certain elements of our US 
retirement benefit plan obligations, a £5 million net business 
re-alignment charge in respect of sucralose and the Group’s 
European operations, and a £3 million gain from disposals by 
Tate & Lyle Ventures. A full summary of exceptional items can 
be found in Note 7.
There was no tax credit on exceptional items (2016 – 
£21 million credit), although the Group did recognise 
exceptional deferred tax credits totalling £65 million (2016 – 
£nil) following recent changes to the Group’s internal financing 
structure, and a transfer of intellectual property assets related 
to SPLENDA
®
 Sucralose to align ownership with the underlying 
manufacturing base.
Net exceptional costs from continuing operations in the prior 
year totalled £50 million, predominantly reflecting business 
re-alignment costs.
Taxation
The Group’s tax rate is sensitive to the geographic mix of profits 
and reflects a combination of higher rates in certain 
jurisdictions such as the US, nil effective rates in the UK due to 
available tax losses, and rates that lie somewhere in between. 
The adjusted effective tax rate on earnings for continuing 
operations for the year ended 31 March 2017 increased to 
18.2% (2016 – 16.5%).
The reported effective tax rate (on statutory earnings) for the 
year was a credit of 9.6% (2016 – a charge of 4.0%), lower as a 
result of the recognition of two significant exceptional deferred 
tax credits totalling £65 million. 
Firstly, as a result of recent changes in UK legislation arising 
from the OECD’s Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS) 
project and changes to the internal financing arrangements we 
use to fund our international businesses, we have recognised 
an exceptional deferred tax credit of £34 million arising from 
previously unrecognised tax losses in the UK, which, based on 
enacted legislation, are now expected to be utilised against 
future UK taxable profits. 
Secondly, the Group transferred at fair value its sucralose 
intellectual property assets from the UK, to align ownership 
with its corresponding manufacturing base in the US, following 
the move to consolidate all sucralose production into our US 
facility in the 2016 financial year. This transfer led to the 
recognition of an exceptional deferred tax credit of £31 million.
The recognition and measurement of deferred tax assets and 
liabilities is dependent on a number of key judgements and 
estimates. The deferred tax asset of £34 million arising from 
the utilisation of UK tax losses following changes to the 
internal financing arrangements reflects judgements related 
principally to: the size and duration of future internal financing 
arrangements; the interest coupon payable on these 
arrangements; the future level of deductible expenses incurred 
in the UK; and foreign currency exchange rates. Changes in 
these assumptions, along with future changes in legislation, for 
example impacting the utilisation of UK tax losses, could have 
a material impact on the amount of deferred tax recognised in 
future accounting periods.
34 Tate & Lyle PLC Annual Report 2017 Assets 
Gross assets of £2,771 million at 31 March 2017 were 
£217 million higher than the prior year on a statutory basis 
reflecting profit for the year and the positive impact of the 
strengthening US dollar, with significant exchange gains  
on translation of foreign operations recognised in other 
comprehensive income. Net assets increased by £303 million 
to £1,332 million.
Retirement benefits 
The Group maintains pension plans for our employees in a 
number of countries. Some of these arrangements are defined 
benefit pension schemes and, although we have closed the 
main UK scheme and the US salaried and hourly paid schemes 
to future accrual, certain obligations remain. In the US, we also 
provide medical benefits as part of retirement packages. 
The net deficit on the Group’s retirement benefits plans 
decreased by £69 million to £139 million. The deficit 
improvement was driven primarily by an increase in the surplus 
of the main UK scheme reflecting an increase in the value of all 
asset classes and lower retirement benefit obligations driven 
by changes in mortality assumptions, partially offset by a 
reduction in the discount rate used to discount future 
pension obligations.
Under funding arrangements in connection with the 2013 
actuarial valuation, the Group committed to make core funding 
contributions for the main UK scheme of £12 million per year 
and supplementary contributions for six years of £6 million per 
year into a secured funding account, payable to the Trustee on 
certain triggering events. 
The main UK scheme triennial valuation as at 31 March 2016 
was concluded during the year, with core funding contributions 
maintained at £12 million per year, with the Group also 
committing to extend the supplementary contributions payable 
into the secured funding account of £6 million per year until 
31 March 2023.
We estimate that, with an increasing mix of US profits, the 
impact of changes to our internal financing structure, and 
under currently enacted legislation, the adjusted effective tax 
rate for the 2018 financial year will be between 21% and 24%. 
We expect the rate of cash tax, being the amount of tax paid as 
a percentage of adjusted profit before tax, to align to the 
adjusted effective tax rate over time. 
Discontinued operations
In the year ended 31 March 2017, the Group recognised a 
£1 million exceptional gain, resulting from the recycling of 
cumulative foreign exchange translation gains from reserves to 
the income statement upon completion of the disposal of its 
corn wet mill in Casablanca, Morocco on 1 June 2016.
The discontinued profit for the year ended 31 March 2016 
principally comprised a net exceptional profit before tax on 
disposal from Eaststarch and Morocco of £64 million (as the 
Group disposed of the predominantly bulk ingredients plants in 
Bulgaria, Turkey, Hungary and Morocco as part of the overall 
re-alignment), and an exceptional legal charge of £18 million 
relating to the sale of the Group’s former EU Sugars business 
in September 2010. 
Earnings per share 
Adjusted basic earnings per share from continuing operations 
increased by 38% to 47.8p and adjusted diluted earnings per 
share from continuing operations at 47.1p were 37% higher.  
Total diluted earnings per share increased to 54.4p (2016 – 34.8p). 
Dividend 
The Board proposes an unchanged final dividend for the year 
ended 31 March 2017 of 19.8p to make an unchanged total for 
the year of 28.0p.
Subject to shareholder approval at the Company’s AGM on 
27 July 2017, the proposed final dividend will be paid on 
1 August 2017 to all shareholders on the Register of Members 
on 30 June 2017. In addition to the cash dividend option, 
shareholders will continue to be offered a Dividend 
Reinvestment Plan (DRIP) alternative.

Adjusted free cash flow (representing cash generated from 
continuing operations excluding the impact of exceptional 
items less net interest paid, income tax paid, and capital 
expenditure) was £174 million, £121 million higher than the 
prior year principally reflecting higher earnings (after adjusting 
for non-cash items) and lower capital expenditure.
Net interest paid increased by £8 million, mostly owing to 
timing of interest payments. Taxation paid was £19 million 
higher reflecting higher taxable profits in the US.
Capital expenditure of £153 million, which included a 
£26 million investment in intangible assets, was 1.1 times the 
depreciation and adjusted amortisation charge of £137 million 
and reflects continued investment in capacity as well as 
efficiency and maintenance investments. We expect capital 
expenditure for the 2018 financial year to be around the 
same level.
Other significant cash flows in arriving at net debt included: 
£29 million of dividends received from joint ventures; external 
dividend payments of £130 million; exceptional cash outflows of 
£24 million; and the £18 million payment for the purchase of 
shares to satisfy share option commitments.
Overall, on a constant currency basis, net debt decreased by 
£39 million in the year, reflecting strong free cash generation in 
the year, which exceeded dividend payments. However, net debt 
at 31 March 2017 of £452 million increased by £18 million due 
to the adverse impact of exchange rates of £57 million, mainly 
as a result of the impact of the stronger US dollar on the 
Group’s US dollar denominated debt. 
Financial risk factors
Our key financial risk factors are market risks, such as foreign 
exchange, transaction and translation exposures, and credit 
and liquidity risks, as explained in Note 29.
Off balance sheet arrangements
In the ordinary course of business, to manage our operations 
and financing, we enter into certain performance guarantees 
and commitments for capital and other expenditure. We aim to 
optimise financing costs in respect of all financing transactions. 
Where it is economically beneficial, we choose to lease rather 
than purchase assets. Leases for property, plant and equipment 
where the lessee does not assume substantially all the risks 
and rewards of ownership are treated as operating leases, with 
annual rentals charged to the income statement over the term 
of the lease. Commitments under operating leases to pay rentals 
in future years totalled £318 million (2016 – £303 million)  
and related primarily to railcar leases in the US and our 
commitment for a gas pipeline to supply our Loudon facility. 
Rental charges for the year ended 31 March 2017 in respect of 
continuing operations were £32 million (2016 – £24 million).

36 Tate & Lyle PLC Annual Report 2017 Use and fair value of financial instruments
In the normal course of business we use both derivative and 
non-derivative financial instruments. The fair value of Group 
net debt at the year end was £472 million against a book value 
of £452 million (2016 – fair value £453 million, book value 
£434 million). Derivative financial instruments used to manage 
the interest rate and currency of borrowings had a fair value  
of £21 million liability (2016 – £5 million asset). The main types 
of instrument used are interest rate swaps and cross-currency 
interest rate swaps. The fair value of other derivative financial 
instruments hedging future currency and commodity 
transactions was £2 million asset (2016 – £4 million liability). 
When managing currency exposure, we use spot and forward 
purchases and sales, and options. The fair value of other 
derivative financial instruments accounted for as held for 
trading was an £11 million asset (2016 – £22 million asset).
Fair value estimation
The fair value of derivative financial instruments is based on 
the market price of comparable instruments at the balance 
sheet date if they are publicly traded. The fair value of the 
forward currency contracts was determined based on market 
forward exchange rates at the balance sheet date. The fair 
values of short-term deposits, receivables, payables, loans and 
overdrafts with a maturity of less than one year are assumed to 
approximate their book values. The fair values of bonds, bank 
and other loans, including finance lease liabilities due in more 
than one year, are estimated by discounting the future 
contractual cash flows at the current market interest rate 
available to the Group for similar financial instruments, 
adjusted for the fair valuation effects of currency and interest 
rate risk exposures, where those instruments form part of 
related hedging relationship agreements, financial and 
commodity forward contracts and options, and commodity 
futures. The values of certain items of merchandisable 
agricultural commodities that are included in inventories are 
based on market prices.
Going concern
The Directors are satisfied that the Group has adequate 
resources to continue to operate for a period not less than 
12 months from the date of approval of the financial statements 
and that there are no material uncertainties around their 
assessment. Accordingly, the Directors continue to adopt the 
going concern basis of accounting. 
Basis of preparation
The Group’s principal accounting policies are unchanged 
compared with the year ended 31 March 2016. A number of 
minor changes to accounting policies have been adopted 
during the year, although they have had no material effect on 
the Group’s financial statements. 
Details of the basis of preparation, including information in 
respect of the methodology used to calculate the Group’s 
adjusted performance metrics, can be found in Notes 1 and 4.
Impact of changes in exchange rates
The Group’s reported financial performance at average rates of 
exchange for the year ended 31 March 2017 was favourably 
impacted by currency translation. The effect of exchange 
translation was to increase adjusted profit before tax by 
£40 million compared with the comparative year principally as 
a result of a weakening of sterling against most other 
currencies following the UK’s vote to leave the EU. The average 
and closing US dollar and euro exchange rates used to 
translate reported results were as follows:
Average rates Closing rates
2017 2016 2017 2016
US dollar: sterling 1.30 1.51 1.25 1.44
Euro: sterling 1.19 1.37 1.17 1.26
Foreign currency impacts and the UK’s 
referendum on EU membership
Sterling has weakened significantly since the UK’s referendum 
on EU membership in June 2016. Average rates for the 
financial year were US dollar:£1 = $1.30; Euro:£1 = €1.19; 
Mexican peso:£1 = 25.11 peso; and Brazilian real:£1 = 4.32 real. 
For the year ended 31 March 2017, foreign exchange 
translation increased Speciality Food Ingredients adjusted 
operating profit by £23 million; and increased Bulk Ingredients 
adjusted operating profit by £18 million, with adjusted profit 
before tax for the Group increasing by £40 million.
We have assessed the impact of the UK referendum result  
on our business. The Group generates less than 2% of its 
revenues in the United Kingdom. The outcome of this 
referendum is not expected to have a material near-term 
impact on our business.

Managing our 
risks effectively
Risk framework
The Board has overall responsibility for the Group’s 
system of risk management and internal control, 
and for setting the Group’s risk appetite. The 
schedule of matters reserved to the Board ensures 
that the Board makes a robust assessment of, 
among other matters, the principal risks facing the 
Group, and determines the nature and extent of risk 
it is willing to take for the Group to achieve its  
strategic objectives.
Approach
Process to identify risks
The Group-wide risk management and reporting 
process helps to identify, assess, prioritise and 
mitigate risk. Principal risks are considered over a 
time period of three years. This annual process is 
both bottom-up and top-down. 
The top-down aspect involves the Board assessing 
what it believes to be the principal risks facing  
Tate & Lyle. The bottom-up aspect of the process 
involves a rolling programme of workshops, 
facilitated by the risk management team, held 
around the Group. During these workshops, current 
and forward-looking risks are identified which are 
collated and reported through functional and 
divisional levels to the Executive Committee. Areas 
and behaviours which could potentially trigger risk 
combinations are also considered.
We combine the results of these processes to 
identify the Group’s key business, strategic, 
financial, operational and compliance risks, and 
then develop action plans and controls to mitigate 
them as far as possible, to the extent deemed 
appropriate taking account of the Group’s risk 
appetite. These risks are then reviewed again by the 
Board, which also reviews emerging and black 
swan risks.
The Group faces a number of risks which could have a material 
adverse effect on our strategy, performance, results, financial 
condition and reputation
How we manage risks
Tate & Lyle’s enterprise risk management (ERM) 
programme facilitates a common, Group-wide 
approach to the identification, analysis and assessment 
of risks and the way risks are managed, controlled 
and monitored.

38 Tate & Lyle PLC Annual Report 2017 Viability statement
In accordance with the provisions of the UK 
Corporate Governance Code issued in September 
2014, the Directors have assessed the viability of the 
Group, taking into account our current position and 
the potential impact of the principal risks we face.
Although the Group’s strategic plan, which the 
Board reviews annually, forecasts beyond three 
years, the current planning process provides for  
the preparation of a detailed financial plan over a 
three-year period, built bottom-up on a divisional 
basis, including anticipated capital and funding 
requirements. For this reason, the Directors have 
determined that a three-year period to 31 March 
2020 is an appropriate period over which to 
assess viability.
To assess viability, we stress-tested the strategic 
plan under four downside scenarios. These were 
seen as key outcomes that would stress the 
potential viability of the Group if one or more of  
the principal risks set out in this Annual Report 
occurred. The potential impact of these scenarios 
was assessed individually, and in combinations,  
on both a gross (before mitigation) and a net (after 
mitigation) basis. The four downside scenarios 
modelled were a major operational failure causing 
the shutdown of a large manufacturing facility for  
an extended period of time, a sharp decline in  
sales in one or more of our major product lines,  
the loss of one or more of our key global customers, 
and government actions or policies restricting or 
preventing our ability to operate in key markets.  
In each case, it was assumed that our ability to 
acquire financing or re-financing in the capital 
markets remained available in all plausible 
market conditions.
The impact of these risks occurring was measured 
by quantifying their financial impact on the strategic 
plan, and on the Group’s viability when set against 
measures including liquidity, credit rating and 
financial covenant requirements. We also 
considered operational and commercial impacts. 
The results of this stress testing showed that the 
Group would, over the three-year period, be able  
to withstand the impact of the most severe 
combination of the risks modelled by making 
adjustments to our strategic plan and capital 
allocation priorities, and other available 
mitigating actions.
Based on this assessment, the Directors confirm 
that they have a reasonable expectation that the 
Group will be able to continue in operation and meet 
its liabilities as they fall due over the period to 
31 March 2020.
Risk appetite
As part of the annual risk assessment process,  
the Board and Executive Committee undertake an 
exercise to consider the nature and extent of the 
Group’s risk appetite. This exercise was refreshed 
during the year with the help of an external risk 
expert facilitator. The results of this exercise are 
used as part of strategic planning activities, and in 
setting ongoing mitigating actions.
Managing risks
Individual executives in each division are assigned 
responsibility for managing risks and their 
associated mitigating controls. As part of the 
process, senior executive management formally 
confirms once a year that risks are being managed 
appropriately within their operations and that 
controls have been examined and are effective.  
The confirmations and any exceptions are  
discussed at the Audit Committee and Corporate 
Responsibility Committee, and, where appropriate, 
reported to the Board.
The Executive Committee reviews the principal risks 
regularly and formally on a quarterly basis, and 
reports any changes in the level or velocity of the 
risks, and associated mitigating actions, to the 
Board. The Board reviews the principal risks at least 
every six months.
Principal risks
The Board has carefully considered the type and 
extent of the principal risks to the Group achieving 
its objectives. While the Group seeks to manage risk 
carefully, at the same time the Board recognises 
that some risk needs to be taken for the Group to 
achieve its strategic goals.
Over time, the risk profile of the Group evolves and 
the Board’s view of the principal risks is updated 
accordingly. This year, ‘shareholder expectations’ 
has been removed as a principal risk following the 
stabilisation and then improvement in the Group’s 
financial performance over the last two years. 
Conversely, given increasing geopolitical uncertainty 
over the last year in some of the markets we 
operate in, the Board has decided to add 
‘government regulations and trade policies’ as a 
principal risk this year. 
The Board confirms that a robust assessment of the 
principal risks facing the Company, including those 
that would threaten its business model, 
performance, solvency and liquidity, has been 
carried out. The principal risks identified as part of 
the process undertaken during the year, together 
with examples of the mitigating actions being taken, 
are set out on pages 40 and 41. It is not possible to 
identify or anticipate every risk that may affect 
the Group.

Safety
Act safely and maintain the safe operation of our facilities
The safety of our employees, contractors, suppliers, and the 
communities in which we operate is paramount. We must operate 
within local laws, regulations, rules and ordinances relating to 
health, safety and the environment, including emissions. Failure to 
act safely, which could lead to loss of life or serious injury, may give 
rise to fines or penalties for breach of safety laws, interruptions in 
operations or loss of our licence to operate, liability payments and 
costs arising from injuries or damage, and damage to our 
reputation.
• Health and safety policies and procedures at all facilities with 
dedicated staff to ensure they are embedded and measured
• Regular review of performance and policies by the Corporate 
Responsibility Committee
• Maintenance of suitable insurance programme
• Programme of global compliance audits; senior executives also 
undertake annual executive audits at most sites
• Process safety management system in place to manage use of

Strategy
Growth in speciality food ingredients
Tate & Lyle’s strategy is to become a leading global provider of 
speciality food ingredients and solutions. Our ability to deliver that 
strategy may be affected by a number of factors such as delivering 
growth in emerging markets, acquisitions, customers’ readiness to 
adopt new ingredients and incorporate them in new product 
launches, competitor actions, and growing key product or product 
families. Failure to deliver our strategy over the longer term would 
negatively affect our credibility, reputation and profitability.
• Investments to increase sales and technical resources, and 
infrastructure, particularly in emerging markets
• New staff recruited and existing staff developed to upgrade skill 
sets in customer-facing areas and innovation
• Enhancement of internal capabilities to promote growth through 
acquisition and partnerships, for example the new distribution 
agreement with Sweet Green Fields for stevia ingredients 
announced during the year
• Global programme to increase customer focus in key areas such 
as customer account management, planning and execution
Innovation
Innovate and commercialise new products
Failure to identify important consumer trends and provide innovative 
solutions, and the inability to successfully commercialise new 
products, could impact the delivery of our strategy. This would affect 
our performance and reputation.
• Innovation and Commercial Development team conducts research 
and works closely with customers and other external 
organisations to identify emerging consumer trends
• Open innovation team actively scouts for breakthrough 
technologies and opportunities across industries and universities
• Global marketing organisation provides support for new product 
launches and consumer and category insight
• Prioritisation of ‘partnership’ opportunities with customers to 
accelerate development cycles and time to market for new 
ingredients
• Tate & Lyle Ventures invests in early-stage companies in the areas 
of food science and technology by partnering with research 
institutions, entrepreneurs and other venture funds
People
Attract, develop, engage and retain key personnel
Performance, knowledge and skills of employees are central to our 
success. We must attract, integrate, engage and retain the talent 
required to deliver our strategy, and have the appropriate processes 
and culture in place. Being unable to retain key people and 
adequately plan for succession could have a negative impact on our 
performance. 
• Remuneration policies designed to attract, retain and reward 
employees with ability and experience to execute Group strategy
• Talent development strategy to provide opportunities for 
employees, as well as training to close skills gaps
• Single global performance management system and talent 
planning processes in place
• Greater focus by the Board on succession planning for business-
critical roles
• Measurement of progress against cultural objectives, for example, 
global employee surveys
Legal and compliance
Comply with legal or regulatory requirements, and our 
Code of Ethics
We operate in a variety of markets and are therefore exposed to a 
wide range of legal and regulatory frameworks. We must understand 
and comply with all applicable legislation. Any breach could have a 
financial impact and damage our reputation. 
• Regular monitoring and review of changes in law and regulation 
in areas such as health and safety, environment, quality, food 
safety, corporate governance and data protection
• Legal teams maintain compliance policies in areas such as 
anti-trust and anti-corruption law; and provide ongoing training  
to employees
• Ethics training provided to employees
• Whistleblowing process in place (Speak Up programme)
Cyber security
Maintain the security of our information systems and data
A cyber security breach, whether as a result of human error, 
deliberate action or the failure of technology systems, could result in 
unauthorised access to or misuse of information systems, 
technology or data. This could cause harm to our assets, loss of 
data, business disruption, legal liabilities and damage to our 
reputation.
• Cyber security enhancement programme in place focused on 
strengthening people, process and technology defences
• Compulsory cyber security training
• Cyber security breach scenario exercises
• Advanced perimeter defences in place
• Continuous vulnerability detection and defences
• Separation of systems within plant network
• Third-party Security Operations Centre providing 24/7 security

40 Tate & Lyle PLC Annual Report 2017 Key: new principal risk this year
Principal risks Examples of how we manage the risk
Operations and supply chain
Maintain the continuous operation of our plant network and 
supply chain, including high standards of customer service
Operating plants involves many risks which could cause temporary 
or permanent breaks in production. We must have a robust sales 
and operations planning process to avoid disruption to the supply 
chain and maintain high standards of customer service. Failure to do 
any of these things could have a material adverse effect on our 
performance and reputation.
• Preventive maintenance programme across the plant network
• Ongoing programme to improve global supply chain processes
• Business continuity capabilities in place to enable supply, as quickly 
as practicable, of product to customers from alternative sources in 
the event of a natural disaster or major equipment or plant failure
• Dedicated internal resources allocated to key projects in 
conjunction with business teams to ensure business continuity  
is not compromised
• Customer service managed by Global Operations as part of 
integrated end-to-end supply chain process
Raw materials
Fluctuations in prices and availability of raw materials, 
energy, freight and other operating inputs
Our margins may be affected by fluctuations in crop prices due to 
factors such as alternative crops, co-product values and the 
variability of local or regional harvests caused by, for example, 
weather conditions, crop disease, climate change or crop yields.  
In some cases, due to the basis for pricing in sales contracts, or due 
to competitive markets, we may not be able to pass on to customers 
the full increase in raw material prices or higher energy, freight or 
other operating costs. Additionally, margins may be affected by 
customers not taking expected volumes. 
• Strategic relationships with suppliers and trading companies 
including multi-year agreements
• Balanced portfolio of supply and tolling contracts in operation 
with customers to manage balance of raw material prices and 
product sales prices and volume risks
• Raw material and energy purchasing policies to provide security 
of supply
• Network of corn elevators to enhance security of supply
• New or back-up supply sources in place in case primary suppliers 
face localised challenges
• Use of derivatives and forward contracts where practical, to hedge 
and manage our exposure to raw material and co-product prices
Quality
Maintain the quality and safety of our products
The safety of the consumers of our products is critical. Poor quality 
or sub-standard products could have a negative impact on consumer 
safety and on our reputation and relationships with customers.
• Strict quality control and product testing procedures to ensure 
products are released only with full quality control clearance
• Quality policies, procedures and performance reviewed regularly 
by the Corporate Responsibility Committee
• Immediate response Recall Committee meets promptly if a recall 
event occurs
• Third-party audit programme supplemented by internal global 
compliance audits
• Regular recall simulation exercises
Consumer concerns and food regulation
Changes in consumer , customer or government attitudes 
to our products
Our freedom or ability to operate may be affected by changes in 
consumer or customer attitudes, food law and regulatory changes, 
political campaigns targeted at specific ingredients or technologies 
or other factors that may impact the regulatory status or perception 
of our products or of their functionality, efficacy or use. We must 
ensure that the science behind our ingredients (for example, health 
claims, nutritional impact) is supported by credible sources, clearly 
communicated and understood by relevant regulatory authorities. 
Failure to do so may restrict the markets for our products.
• Global regulatory team, supported by external consultants, 
monitors local regulatory requirements affecting our products
• Global nutrition team initiates and monitors research and 
publications concerning the use and functionality of our 
ingredients and maintains global network of health and nutrition 
clinicians, academics and experts
• Membership of trade organisations provides access to broader 
sources of information and ensures, where appropriate, a single 
voice for the industry on regulatory and public interest issues 
affecting our ingredients
• Maintenance of relations with regulatory authorities
• Provision of clear information on ingredients’ provenance  
and traceability
• Research Advisory Group, chaired by a non-executive director and 
comprising leading scientific experts, reviews critical aspects of 
the Group’s innovation activities and provides guidance
Government regulations and trade policies
Changes in government regulations and/or trade policies
Government actions or policies causing changes in quotas, tariffs or 
customs duties, or imposing import/export limitations, or other 
barriers, may lead to our business incurring additional costs, or may 
restrict opportunities for growth or prevent our ability to operate in 
certain markets. 
• Programme in place to ensure that we actively engage in 
discussions with political parties, influencers and regulatory 
authorities in the main countries we operate in
• Active member of relevant industry trade associations
• Model in place enabling production across the plant network to be 
adapted or optimised in the event of market restrictions in certain 
countries
• Operation of a global plant network means customers can be 
served from different countries if products from certain markets 
are restricted or become economically less attractive
• Continue to invest in resources and infrastructure across different 
markets and geographies to diversify business mix
Financial controls
Maintain an effective system of internal financial controls
Without effective internal financial controls, we could be exposed to 
financial irregularities and losses from acts which could have a 
significant impact on the ability of the business to operate. We must 
safeguard business assets and ensure the accuracy and reliability of 
our records and financial reporting. 
• Financial policies and standards are in place supported by procedures 
for key financial processes, for example, capital expenditure
• Financial risks are monitored and managed through a number of 
forums, for example, the regional Control Environment Councils
• Chief Executive and Chief Financial Officer undertake detailed 
quarterly business and financial reviews
• Process controls were reviewed during the year for existence and 
effectiveness
• Automated controls are built into systems where possible

We believe in equal opportunities for all, regardless of gender, 
sexual orientation, age, marital status, disability, race, religion 
or other beliefs and ethnic or national origin.
Our policies, practices and procedures for recruitment, training 
and career development are designed to promote equality of 
opportunity. We are committed to treating people with 
disabilities fairly in all respects, including job applications, 
training, promotion and career development. If an employee 
became disabled we would, where appropriate, aim to retrain 
them for a more suitable role.
Employee engagement
We believe that employees who are committed to Tate & Lyle’s 
goals, Values and strategy are happier and ultimately deliver 
better results.
Good internal communication is the key to creating real 
employee engagement. We communicate with our employees 
across the world in a number of ways, using channels such as 
our intranet, our Yammer internal social network, our global 
employee magazine published every four months in English 
and summarised in nine languages, team meetings and 
face-to-face dialogue.
We invest in helping employees and managers stay up to date 
with the latest requirements of their roles. During the year, this 
included a supervisors’ development programme and a people 
management development programme. We also trained 
managers in the latest techniques for conducting performance 
reviews and engaging in active dialogue with their people 
throughout the year.
In June 2016 we conducted a Group-wide ‘pulse survey’ to 
measure our progress in those areas identified for action in  
the 2015 global employee survey. 77% of our employees 
participated in the survey, which showed that we had made 
good progress in the areas identified, with further 
improvements planned to be made during the year. 
Diversity and inclusion
We believe that all employees contribute to the performance of 
the Group and should have the opportunity to develop fully 
according to their individual abilities. We aim to attract a 
diverse workforce that reflects the communities in which we 
operate. Through our Employee Resource Groups, company 
magazine, internal website and various other communication 
channels, we work to create awareness of diversity and 
inclusion issues and to promote equal opportunities.

STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS USEFUL INFORMATION
www.tateandlyle.com 43 Our ultimate goal is to have no accidents and no injuries. Our 
Executive Safety Steering Committee, chaired by our Chief 
Executive, meets throughout the year to review our safety 
performance and safety improvement programmes. In addition, 
our senior executives personally undertake executive safety 
audits at all major sites around the world every year.
Performance
For employees and contractors, the combined recordable 
injuries decreased by 12%
1
 in the calendar year 2016 and the 
lost-work cases decreased by 38%, as shown on page 45. The 
combined recordable incident rate remained flat in 2016. The 
combined lost-work case rate decreased by 31% compared to 
2015, as indicated in the table below. The majority of incidents 
requiring treatment beyond first aid were the result of being 
struck by or struck against an object.
Despite the overall improvement in our safety performance, the  
year was overshadowed by an industrial accident in which an 
employee and a local farmer tragically lost their lives at one of 
our grain elevators in the US. The incident is still under 
investigation. 
Following the accident, we instructed our grain elevator insurer 
to conduct safety assessments at every grain elevator and 
revised our safety policies and the technical standards for 
bucket elevators, as well as making a number of targeted 
safety-related investments. Finally, we conducted safety 
training for all grain elevator operators and staff.
In early 2017, we launched a comprehensive Group-wide safety 
review supported by an independent external expert consultancy 
experienced in heavy processing industries. The objective was to 
assess our facilities’ safety performance in terms of processes, 
organisation and culture and to highlight improvement 
opportunities. 
As part of the Group-wide safety assessment, our global safety 
management systems were also reviewed, and an all-employee 
Group-wide safety culture survey was carried out. 
The learnings from this review will make a critical contribution 
to ensure that all our employees, contractors and visitors are 
kept safe at all times. 
External benchmarking
To put our safety performance in context (and to reflect the fact 
that the majority of our employees are located in the US), we 
compare our results with US industry averages, as shown in 
the graphs on page 45.
Safety improvements
We work hard to continuously improve our safety programmes, 
controls and performance. During 2016 we put in place the 
following initiatives:
• Reducing contractor accidents: We set out to improve our 
contractor safety culture to reduce the number and severity 
of contractor accidents. As part of this we introduced a 
‘teamwork’ approach, combining safety statistics, milestone 
achievements and celebrations with those of our employees, 
and invited contractors to our safety committee meetings. In 
the US, Brazil and Mexico, we also invited contractors to 
monthly incident calls, and conducted monthly calls with 
contractor safety directors and our insurer to discuss safety 
audit trends and action plans. We also required our 
manufacturing sites to put in place a contractor hazard 
recognition and reporting programme, if they did not already 
have one.
• Machine guarding: We conducted training on machine 
guarding and required all sites to continue making 
improvements in this area.
• Annual global safety week: This annual event saw many 
employees and their families, as well as contractors, taking 
part in activities across our sites worldwide. Our annual 
children’s safety calendar drawing contest, for employees’ 
families, encourages the next generation to be aware 
of safety.
Ergonomics
In 2016, we asked all sites to make at least one ergonomic 
improvement at their facility to improve material handling and 
work posture. Examples included sites buying pallet lifts so 
employees no longer have to lift from floor level, as well as 
changing the seats used by security guards to make them 
more comfortable and supportive during long periods of sitting. 
We hope to see the benefit from these improvements in 2017.

STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS USEFUL INFORMATION
www.tateandlyle.com 45 We aim to reduce our environmental impact, and we 
continuously work to reduce energy, water and waste 
throughout our global operations. 
We address environmental considerations across the life-cycle 
of our products, from our agricultural supply chain, processing, 
and through to how our products are packaged 
and transported.
Policy and standards
Our environmental policy and standards apply to all our 
activities around the world, and we aim to integrate 
environmental considerations in all major decisions. We 
promote environmental communication and awareness across 
the Group, including during induction sessions and other 
training opportunities at our manufacturing facilities.  
Our environmental policy is available on the Company’s 
website, www.tateandlyle.com.
All our facilities are subject to local environmental 
authorisations and permits, and we do our best to comply with 
these at all times. If a site breaches an operating limit, we aim 
to immediately resolve the issue. Our internal environmental 
audit programmes reinforce adherence to our management 
standards. 
Within our own operations and joint ventures, we focus our 
attention on activities that have the greatest potential impact 
on the environment. We aim to reduce energy use, our carbon 
footprint, waste to landfill and water use. In 2016, we achieved 
a leadership position of A- in the CDP . 
Outside our own operations we focus on our agricultural raw 
material and ingredient supply chain, the transportation of our 
products to our customers and our product packaging.
Performance
As set out in last year’s Annual Report, this year we have 
restated all our environmental performance measures for all 
years back to 2008, for the effect of the disposed Eaststarch 
plants. Performance between 2015 and 2016 based on the 
revised baseline shows underlying improvement across all 
environmental metrics, as shown in the environmental 
performance charts on page 47.
Corporate Responsibility continued
Hand safety
In July, we launched our hand safety campaign that included 
monthly communications, posters and safety meetings that 
looked at everything from rotating machinery and electrical 
safety to gloves. This campaign ran for 10 months. 
Safe design and condition of tall structures  
and process storage
Further to our progress in 2015, we continued our programme 
of structural integrity checks carried out by external engineers. 
Our aim was to make sure all our tall buildings and process 
storage structures and equipment were safely designed and in 
good condition. In 2016, we carried out structural integrity 
assessments at our grain elevators and bulk syrup stations. 
Behavioural safety
In 2016, we continued to roll out SafeStart
®
 behavioural safety 
training at our global manufacturing facilities, together with 
safety intervention and feedback training for management at 
our US corn plants. We also provided SafeStart
® 
training for 
employees in our offices and labs.
‘Let’s Stay Safe’ booklet
In 2016, we continued to roll out our ‘Let’s Stay Safe’ booklet 
which was first launched in 2015 and is designed to increase 
awareness and promote programmes that prevent serious 
injuries and fatalities.
Occupational health and well-being
We use external occupational health professionals to monitor 
and safeguard the health of employees at work. These experts 
also provide information, advice and support for general health 
and well-being.
We aim to promote an active lifestyle across the Group. A good 
example is our participation in the Global Corporate Challenge, 
a workplace engagement programme undertaken by 
companies around the world every year. In 2016, 924 employees 
across all areas and levels of Tate & Lyle took part in this 
100-day challenge, working in teams of seven to take more 
than 10,000 steps every day. We are proud to say our employees 
achieved an average of 12,855 steps each day, beating the 
global benchmark of 12,700. Learn more at

48 Tate & Lyle PLC Annual Report 2017 The food and beverage industry is our largest market sector. 
Other industry sectors we sell into include industrial, animal 
feed and personal care.
Increasingly, investors recognise that a proactive approach to 
corporate responsibility is important for business success.  
Our customers expect us to understand and respond to the key 
sustainability challenges affecting their industry. Climate 
change, water use, packaging waste, sustainable agriculture 
and labour standards in the supply chain are among the most 
critical issues for customers and investors. We are actively 
putting in place programmes to address these issues.
During 2016, our customers have increasingly looked beyond 
their own operations to set ambitious objectives and targets to 
reduce the impact of their supply chain. We continue to work 
with our customers and our suppliers to find new ways to help 
them meet these objectives.
Product safety, quality and sustainability 
Our products are produced to the highest quality, traceability 
and food safety standards. Our manufacturing facilities are 
externally certified to make sure they meet the Global Food 
Safety Initiative. Our control arrangements include: in-process 
testing; our global compliance audit programme; annual 
product traceability and recall testing scheme (globally and 
locally at each facility); and independent food safety audits of 
every manufacturing site.
We consider sustainability criteria in the development of new 
products. We use a sustainability evaluation tool as part of our 
innovation pipeline to identify any potential sustainability 
concerns early in the product development process. This tool 
also helps us assess sustainability issues during product 
development, helping us avoid or reduce the use of energy and 
non-renewable resources, and to increase positive impacts 
such as health and wellness benefits.
We help our customers offer their consumers healthy, 
nutritious food and beverages that form an important part of a 
balanced diet. We aim to ensure that our ingredients, and any 
claims we make about their benefits, are supported by clear, 
authoritative evidence.
Sustainable agriculture
The majority of our products are derived from agricultural raw 
materials. The biggest of these by volume is corn, but we also 
buy a large number of other ingredients, for specific applications. 
In 2012, we announced our plans to introduce sustainable 
agricultural sourcing programmes for our top 20 agricultural 
raw materials (by volume) by the end of 2016. 
We have established criteria for priority ingredients including 
corn, sugar cane, palm oil and soy-derived ingredients. 
Building on the five stages of our Sustainable Agriculture 
Programme, our focus has been to assess risk to understand 
the social and environmental impacts associated with each 
ingredient. Going forward, we will strengthen our programme 
to deepen our engagement with customers and suppliers.
Building on this progress we are now extending our 
Sustainable Agriculture Programme, with a target to cover a 
total of 35 ingredients by 2020. 
We continue to work closely with key customers to help them 
meet their targets and realise their ambitions for 
sustainable agriculture.
In 2014, we joined Field to Market (www.fieldtomarket.org), the 
US alliance for sustainable agriculture, in order to help define, 
measure and advance sustainability in US agriculture, 
particularly with regard to corn. We have been developing a 
farm-level sustainable agriculture project for US corn through 
the Field to Market programme.

STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS USEFUL INFORMATION Chairman’s introduction to Corporate Governance
Focus for the 2018 financial year
The Board continues to devote significant time to the drivers of 
growth in the business and the challenges and opportunities 
the Group faces in its markets. As such, the areas of emphasis 
in the coming year will include: 
• Performance of the Speciality Food Ingredients business
• Programmes to strengthen further our commercial focus 
and execution
• Strategic initiatives, including acquisition opportunities
• Innovation pipeline
• Reviewing talent management and succession planning. 
Notwithstanding our commercial priorities, operating our 
business responsibly and safely continues to be an 
overriding imperative.
Shareholder engagement
As part of my induction, I met with a number of our larger 
shareholders to understand their views of the business, its 
performance and strategic direction and I very much appreciate 
the insights from those conversations. The Board is committed 
to maintaining an open dialogue with shareholders and I, and 
my fellow Directors, welcome the opportunity to meet with 
those of you who are able to attend our Annual General 
Meeting on 27 July 2017.
Gerry Murphy
Chairman
Dear shareholder
Since joining Tate & Lyle on 1 January, I have had the 
opportunity to experience the strong governance culture of our 
Board and the seriousness with which it takes its responsibility 
for setting strategy, monitoring its execution and managing the 
Group’s risks. 
Board effectiveness
As Chairman, it is my responsibility to lead the Board and to 
ensure its effectiveness in all aspects of its remit. 
The Board last undertook an externally moderated evaluation 
of its effectiveness in 2014. The UK Corporate Governance Code 
recommends such an external evaluation every three years but, 
in view of the succession of both Chairman and Senior 
Independent Director, the Board decided to proceed instead 
with an internal effectiveness review in the year ended  
31 March 2017. I am grateful to our new Senior Independent 
Director, Douglas Hurt, for conducting this review and to him 
and the other Committee Chairs, Anne Minto and Jeanne 
Johns, for reviewing the work of their respective Committees. 
Following the changes in Board composition last year, we will 
undertake an external evaluation of the Board’s effectiveness in 
the current financial year. As part of this review we will look at 
the alignment of our Board processes and deliberations with 
the strategic needs of the business in the years ahead. 
Inheriting  
a strong 
governance 
culture
Dr Gerry Murphy, Chairman

STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS USEFUL INFORMATION The Board reviews the balance of experience, skills, gender 
and diversity of thinking styles around the boardroom table 
regularly to ensure that the composition of the Board and  
its Committees is appropriate for the Group as it continues  
to evolve and implement the strategy. The Board and its 
Committees carry out a formal effectiveness review process 
once a year which provides new insights into the operation of 
the Board and areas for development or particular focus.
Board composition
At the date of this Annual Report, the Board comprised 11 
directors with deep knowledge and experience in diverse 
business sectors within global markets: the Chairman, who 
has no executive responsibilities; two executive directors;  
and eight non-executive directors. The names, skills and 
experience of the Directors are set out on pages 52 to 55.
Appointments to the Board
The Nominations Committee has responsibility for the 
appointment of non-executive and executive directors and 
recommends new appointments to the Board. During the year, 
the Nominations Committee carried out a search exercise  
for two additional non-executive directors (including the 
Chairman-designate). The Board approved the Nominations 
Committee’s recommendations and Jeanne Johns and  
Dr Gerry Murphy joined the Board on 26 October 2016 and  
1 January 2017 respectively. Further details about the 
appointment process are set out in the Nominations 
Committee report on pages 70 and 71.
Re-election of Directors
The Code provides that all Directors should seek re-election  
on an annual basis and all Directors, with the exception of  
Liz Airey, will seek re-election at the forthcoming AGM.  
The Directors standing for re-election, with the exception  
of Javed Ahmed and Nick Hampton, do not have service 
contracts. Each Director goes through a formal performance 
review process as part of the annual Board effectiveness 
review. All Directors completed this process during the year 
and, in line with the Code, Douglas Hurt, who has served for 
over six years, has been subject to a particularly 
rigorous review.
Independence
The Code provides that the Board should state its reasons if it 
determines that a Director is independent notwithstanding the 
existence of relationships or circumstances which may appear 
relevant to its determination, including if the Director has 
served on the Board for more than nine years from the date of 
his or her first election. 
With the exception of Dr Gerry Murphy, who, as Chairman, is 
presumed under the Code not to be independent, the Board 
considers all the non-executive directors who are seeking 
re-election to be independent.
Directors’ interests
During the year, no Directors had a material interest in any 
contract with the Group, being a contract of significance in 
relation to the Group’s business. A statement of Directors’ 
interests in Company shares is set out on page 97.

Effectiveness
60 Tate & Lyle PLC Annual Report 2017 2017 Board effectiveness review
In the ordinary course of business, the Board would have 
carried out an externally facilitated review of its effectiveness 
this year. However, in view of the number of changes to the 
Board, in particular the appointment of the Chairman-
designate and the change in Senior Independent Director, the 
Directors agreed to defer the externally facilitated review until 
after the appointment of the new Chairman. This review will 
take place in the 2018 financial year instead. 
This year, Douglas Hurt, the Senior Independent Director from 
1 January 2017, led the internal review of Board effectiveness 
with support from the Company Secretary. The process 
involved the preparation of two questionnaires. The first 
focused on the strategic framework, progress and priorities 
and the other on Board mechanics, agenda and general 
effectiveness. The output from the questionnaires was 
summarised in a report that was discussed by the Board.  
From this, the Directors concluded that they are satisfied that 
the Board and its Committees continued to operate effectively 
and agreed a number of action points, including:
• Reviewing the remits of the Audit Committee and Corporate 
Responsibility Committee to address any areas of potential 
overlap
• Considering opportunities to align management and Board 
information reporting to minimise multiple reporting formats
• Identifying more time in the Board calendar to focus on the 
strategy to deliver progression towards the 2020 Ambition.
Review of the Committees
In addition to the Board effectiveness review, the chairman of 
each of the Committees facilitated a review of his or her own 
Committee’s effectiveness. These reviews confirmed that all 
Committees continue to provide effective support to the Board. 
Areas for further focus are noted in the individual 
Committee reports.
Review of individual Directors
Dr Gerry Murphy led performance reviews of the non-executive 
directors, while the Nominations Committee reviewed the 
performance of the Chief Executive, Chief Financial Officer and 
the other members of the Executive Committee, in line with its 
terms of reference. These reviews confirmed that each Director 
continues to make an effective contribution to the Board’s work 
and is well-prepared and informed about issues they needed to 
consider. In each case, their commitment remains strong.
Professional development and independent 
site visit programme
Directors receive ongoing training and updates on relevant 
issues as appropriate, taking into account their individual 
qualifications and experience. The Company Secretary helps 
Directors undertake any other professional development they 
consider necessary to assist them in carrying out their duties. 
During the year, in addition to the Board’s visits to the 
Commercial and Food Innovation Centre in Chicago, USA, the 
Chairman and/or various of the non-executive directors visited 
five of the Group’s sites in Europe and four of the Group’s sites 
in the US as part of their independent site visit, or induction, 
programmes. These visits provide Directors with the 
opportunity to interact with local management and to gain 
in-depth knowledge about the opportunities and challenges  
for the Group’s operations across the world.
Advice and support
All Directors have access to the advice and services of the 
Company Secretary, who is responsible for ensuring that the 
Board follows due process, and that the Company complies 
with applicable rules and regulations.
There is also a formal procedure whereby Directors can  
obtain independent professional advice, if necessary,  
at the Company’s expense.

STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS USEFUL INFORMATION Directors’ conflicts of interest
Directors have a statutory duty to avoid situations in which they 
may have interests that conflict with those of the Company, 
unless that conflict is first authorised by the Board. As 
permitted under the Companies Act 2006, the Company’s 
Articles of Association allow Directors to authorise conflicts of 
interest and the Board has an established policy and set of 
procedures for managing and, where appropriate, authorising, 
actual or potential conflicts of interest.
The key elements of those procedures are as follows:
• Directors are required to disclose proposed new 
appointments to the Chairman before taking them on,  
to ensure that any potential conflicts of interest can be 
identified and addressed appropriately, for instance through 
the agreement and implementation of guidelines and 
protective measures regarding the ongoing management  
of any situational conflict
• Directors are required to declare other situations which 
could result in a potential conflict of interest
• Any potential conflicts of interest in relation to proposed 
Directors are considered by the Board prior to their 
appointment
• The Board reviews Directors’ actual or potential conflicts of 
interest at least annually.
During the year, the Board assessed and approved potential 
conflicts, together with guidelines and protective measures 
as appropriate.
Directors’ indemnities and insurance cover
As at the date of this Annual Report, the Company has agreed 
to indemnify the Directors, to the extent permitted by the 
Companies Act 2006, against claims from third parties in 
respect of certain liabilities arising out of, or in connection with, 
the execution of their powers, duties and responsibilities as 
Directors of the Company and any of its subsidiaries. The 
Directors are also indemnified against the cost of defending  
a criminal prosecution or a claim by the Company, its 
subsidiaries or a regulator, provided that where the defence is 
unsuccessful the Director must repay those defence costs. 
These indemnities are qualifying indemnity provisions for the 
purposes of Sections 232 to 234 of the Companies Act 2006, 
and copies are available for inspection at our registered office 
during business hours on any weekday except UK public 
holidays. Equivalent indemnities remain in force for Sir Peter 
Gershon and William Camp who ceased to be Directors on  
31 March 2017.
The Company also maintains Directors’ and officers’ liability 
insurance cover, and reviews the level of cover each year.
Corporate Governance continued
The Board is responsible for determining the nature and extent 
of the principal risks it is willing to take in achieving the Group’s 
strategic objectives and for maintaining sound risk 
management and internal control systems.
Risk management and internal control
A formal process is in place which aims to identify and evaluate 
risks and how they are managed, further details of which are 
set out on pages 38 and 39.
The objective of the internal control system is to protect the 
Group’s assets and reputation and to ensure the reliability of 
financial information for both internal use and external 
publication. The systems of internal control and risk 
management cannot eliminate the risk of failure to achieve 
business objectives and can only provide reasonable, not 
absolute, assurance against material misstatement or loss.
An overview of the Group’s internal control system is set out on 
page 63 with details of those people or functions responsible 
for managing or monitoring risks set out on page 64.
2017 review of the effectiveness of the  
system of internal control 
The Board monitors the effectiveness of the Group’s systems of 
internal control and risk management throughout the year. 
Once a year, the Board, supported by the Audit and Corporate 
Responsibility Committees, conducts its own review of the 
effectiveness of the systems of risk management and internal 
control. As last year, the 2017 review was facilitated by Group 
Audit and Assurance and covered the period from the start of 
the financial year to the date of this Annual Report. The process 
included a two-stage review to facilitate discussion, with the 
Audit and Corporate Responsibility Committees discussing the 
results of the review at their meetings in March and May 2017. 
The Board then discussed the output at its meeting in May 2017.
The 2017 review covered financial, operational and compliance 
controls, Values and behaviours, and the risk management 
process, and included questionnaires and representation 
letters completed by management. Group Audit and Assurance 
monitored and selectively checked the results of the review, 
ensuring that the responses from management were 
consistent with the results of its work during the year. As part 
of this process, areas for enhancements to internal controls, 
and associated action plans to deliver them, were identified. 
Delivery of these enhancements is being monitored by the 
Audit Committee or Corporate Responsibility Committee  
as appropriate. 
The Board considers that none of the areas identified for 
improvement constituted a significant weakness.

Key features of the internal control system
Speak Up (whistleblowing)
Speak Up, the Group’s whistleblowing programme, has been in 
place for a number of years in all operations controlled by the 
Group. This programme, which is monitored by the Audit and 
Corporate Responsibility Committees, is designed to enable 
employees, contractors, customers, suppliers and other 
stakeholders to raise concerns confidentially about conduct 
they consider contrary to the Group’s Values. It may include, for 
example, unsafe or unethical practices, or criminal offences.
The Speak Up programme provides a number of ways to raise 
concerns including a telephone reporting line, email, and a 
web-based reporting facility. These multilingual communication  
channels are operated by independent service providers who 
submit reports to the Speak Up Committee for investigation 
as necessary.
Reports received during the year were kept strictly confidential 
and the concerns identified were referred to appropriate 
managers within the Group for resolution. Where appropriate, 
action was taken to address the issues raised. The reports 
were analysed and monitored to ensure the process continued 
to be effective. The Audit and Corporate Responsibility 
Committees received analysis of all reports submitted via  
the Speak Up programme during the year.
Financial reporting internal control system
This system covers the financial reporting process and  
the Group’s process for preparing consolidated accounts.  
It includes policies and procedures which require:
• The maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, 
accurately and fairly reflect transactions including the 
acquisition and disposal of assets
• Reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as 
necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in 
accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards
• Reasonable assurance regarding the prevention or timely 
detection of unauthorised use of the Group’s assets.
We also have specific disclosure controls and procedures 
around the approval of the Group’s financial statements. Twice 
a year, representatives from the business units certify that they 
have complied with the minimum control standards and that 
their reported information provides a true and fair view of the 
state of the financial affairs of their division and its results for 
the period. The results of this financial disclosure process are 
reported to the Audit Committee.

Investor calendar
We are committed to maintaining an open dialogue with 
shareholders, debt investors and potential investors and 
recognise the importance of that relationship in the 
governance process.
We have a focused investor relations programme that aims to 
help existing and potential investors understand the Group.  
We provide feedback from the investment community to all 
Directors regularly to ensure they understand the views 
expressed by major investors.
Institutional investors
The Chief Executive, Chief Financial Officer and VP , Investor 
and Media Relations maintain a regular programme of 
meetings with institutional shareholders in the UK, Europe  
and North America.
After joining the Board on 1 January 2017, Dr Murphy held 
meetings with a number of institutional shareholders. The 
Chief Financial Officer and VP , Investor and Media Relations 
attended a group meeting arranged by the UK Shareholders’ 
Association during the year. Anne Minto, Chairman of the 
Remuneration Committee, met with governance 
representatives of a number of the Company’s principal 
investors and discussed remuneration matters (see page 84 for 
more information). All Directors received periodic updates on 
investor activity and meetings. 
Analysts
As well as the full-year and half-year results presentations to 
investors and analysts, we host conference calls after each 
trading update. We publish any presentations, together with the 
associated announcements, on the Company’s website and we 
also make any audio recordings available for a short period 
after each event. The Chief Financial Officer and VP , Investor 
and Media Relations also meet regularly with analysts.
Independent feedback on our investor relations 
programme 
Each year, an external investor relations advisor undertakes a 
comprehensive review of investor perceptions of the Group, 
management, strategy and communications. The output from 
this review was presented to the Board in November 2016 and 
actions taken forward by management. Recommendations 
included a re-focusing of the Group’s investor targeting 
programme in North America, and increasing the time  
the Chief Financial Officer spends with analysts.
Other capital providers
The Chief Financial Officer and Group Treasurer regularly meet 
with our committed lending banks and bond holders and 
ratings agencies (Standard & Poor’s and Moody’s).
Engagement with shareholders  
and others
Private (retail) shareholders
We encourage private shareholders to provide feedback to the 
Board via the Company Secretary. We also include a questions 
card with the AGM documentation sent to shareholders so that 
those who cannot attend the meeting have the opportunity to 
ask questions.
Annual General Meeting
The AGM provides all shareholders with the opportunity to 
question the Board on matters put to the meeting, including  
this Annual Report. Shareholders who attended last year’s AGM

STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS USEFUL INFORMATION Corporate Governance continued
This year , we continued our practice 
of looking in depth at certain 
aspects of the control environment.
Dear shareholder
This report aims to provide an insight into the work of the  
Audit Committee and how we fulfilled our responsibilities 
during the year.
In addition to our usual matters, including the financial results 
for the full year and half year, applicable accounting policies 
and going concern assumptions, we continued with our 
practice of looking in depth at certain aspects of the control 
environment. These included commodities risk management, 
an impact assessment of new accounting standards, in 
particular IFRSs 15 and 9, and a review of our Global Shared 
Services Centre in Łódz �, Poland. Finance and operational 
leaders attended the meeting for these detailed reviews. 
As disclosed previously, we aim to appoint new external 
auditors for the financial year ending 31 March 2019, to 
coincide with the rotation of the incumbent audit engagement 
partner. We have started the tender process and I will report 
the outcome to you when we have completed it.
During the year, I held separate one-to-one meetings with the 
Chief Financial Officer, the VP , Group Audit and Assurance and 
PwC, our external auditors. These meetings enabled me to 
probe any issues and areas of concern, to ensure that my 
fellow Committee members had an appropriate level of 
information, and that we had enough time to devote to the 
issues in our formal meetings.
Looking ahead, we will continue to focus on the impact of the 
evolving nature of the Group on our accounting policies and 
practices, and associated disclosure. In addition, we will maintain 
our programme of in-depth reviews of the control environment.
I look forward to meeting you at our forthcoming AGM on  
27 July 2017.

Responsibilities
The Committee assists the Board by overseeing financial 
reporting, internal controls, the risk management process,  
the internal audit function (Group Audit and Assurance) and our 
relationship with the external auditors. Further details of its 
responsibilities are in the Committee’s terms of reference,  
on the Company’s website, www.tateandlyle.com.
Composition
During the year, the Committee comprised five independent 
Directors. All members have extensive management 
experience in large international organisations and bring a 
wide range of financial and commercial experience from 
various industries. The Code stipulates that at least one 
Committee member should have recent and relevant financial 
experience. Two members met this requirement: Douglas Hurt 
was Finance Director at IMI plc and is a Fellow of the Institute 
of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales, and Liz Airey 
was an investment banker and former finance director of 
Monument Oil and Gas plc. The Company Secretary is the 
secretary to the Committee.
Meetings during the year
Meetings are generally scheduled in line with key times in the 
Group’s financial reporting calendar. The Committee held five 
scheduled meetings during the year. Attendance during the 
year was as follows:

attend and present to the Committee on an ad hoc basis, 
depending on the issues being discussed.
Effectiveness
The Committee Chairman and Company Secretary led a review 
of the Committee’s effectiveness and the output was discussed 
by the Committee. This concluded that the Committee 
continued to operate effectively and identified a number of 
areas to focus on during next year’s deep dive programme, 
including treasury, business performance management, the 
finance function of the Speciality Food Ingredients division and 
further aspects of our Commodities operations.
Douglas Hurt, Chairman of the Audit Committee
Audit Committee Report
66 Tate & Lyle PLC Annual Report 2017 Work undertaken during the year
The Committee maintains a calendar of items for consideration 
at each meeting and reviews and updates it regularly. As well 
as the work referred to above, the Committee focused on four 
main areas: financial reporting; oversight of the external 
auditors; oversight of the internal audit function; and internal 
control and risk management.
Financial reporting
At each of its meetings, the Audit Committee reviewed and 
constructively challenged the accounting judgements and 
disclosures set out in the papers prepared by management  
and determined, with the help of the external auditors, the 
appropriateness of these. The significant issues considered by 
the Committee in relation to this year’s financial statements 
are listed on page 68.
The Committee also considered management’s review of 
reported and adjusted earnings, and satisfied itself that 
significant one-off items of income and expense had been 
correctly classified and appropriately disclosed. Papers on  
the Group’s existing and emerging litigation risks were  
also considered.
External auditors
PwC (or its predecessor firms) have been the Group’s auditors 
since 1989. The lead audit partner is rotated every five years. 
The current lead audit partner, John Waters, has been in post 
since the audit for the year ended 31 March 2014. Accordingly, 
he is due to rotate off at the conclusion of the audit for the year 
ending 31 March 2018.
In accordance with the Competition and Markets Authority 
Order and the Committee’s terms of reference, the Committee 
Chairman, on behalf of the Committee, negotiated and agreed 
the fee and scope of the statutory audit for the year ended  
31 March 2017.
Safeguarding the auditors’ independence
The Committee operates a policy to safeguard the objectivity 
and independence of the external auditors. This policy sets out 
certain disclosure requirements by the external auditors to the 
Committee; restrictions on the employment of the external 
auditors’ former employees; and partner rotation.
During the year, the Committee reviewed the processes that 
the external auditors have in place to safeguard their 
independence, and received a letter from the external auditors 
confirming that, in their opinion, they remained independent.
Provision of non-audit services
The policy also sets out the circumstances in which the 
external auditors may be permitted to undertake non-audit 
services and the services which are not permitted under any 
circumstances, such as the provision of remuneration advice 
and internal audit outsourcing. 
The Committee reviews the policy each year and considers 
quarterly reports which set out the ongoing non-audit services 
provided by the auditors and the fees incurred. During the year, 
we reviewed and updated the policy on non-audit services in 
accordance with the Revised Ethical Standard 2016 published 
by the Financial Reporting Council. Under our new policy, the 
Chief Financial Officer has authority to approve the permitted 
services up to £10,000 and the Chairman of the Committee has 
authority to approve up to £100,000. In all other cases, the 
Committee must approve any proposed, permitted, non-audit 
services. 
A breakdown of the fees paid to the external auditors in respect 
of audit- and non-audit related work is included in Note 9.
The total amount paid in respect of the Group audit and audit  
of subsidiaries was £2.4 million, and £0.1 million was paid in 
respect of non-audit-related services. Fees paid in respect of 
non-audit-related services therefore comprised 4% of the total 
fees paid to PwC.
Effectiveness of the external auditors
Following the conclusion of the audit for the year ended  
31 March 2016, the Committee conducted an internal review  
of the effectiveness of the external auditors. As part of the 
process, the Committee reviewed the auditors’ performance 
against criteria set at the start of the audit, together with 
feedback from management at Group and divisional levels.  
It also considered:
• The most recent report by the Financial Reporting Council 
(FRC) in May 2016 on the audit quality inspection of PwC.  
The priority sectors for inspection in this report included  
the sector the Group operated in i.e. the food, drink and 
consumer goods sector 
• The FRC’s guidance on evaluating audit quality which 
suggested reviewing the external auditors’ competence  
in the following areas:
 – making appropriate judgements about materiality
 – identifying and focusing on the areas of greatest risk
 – designing and carrying out effective audit procedures
 – understanding and interpreting the evidence they obtain
 – making reliable evaluations of that evidence
 – reporting clearly and honestly.
The Committee concluded that the external audit process  
was operating effectively and that PwC continued to provide 
effective and independent challenge to management. The 
review identified a number of recommendations where we 
could improve processes including planning and communication 
for the US component audit, and these were implemented  
and incorporated into the criteria set for the audit for the 
current year. The Committee discussed progress against  
these criteria regularly.

STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS USEFUL INFORMATION Corporate Governance continued
Significant accounting matters considered by the Committee 
Issues Background Committee’s activities and conclusion
Commodity 
risk
We use commodity contracts to manage 
and hedge our corn positions in the US. 
The valuations of the corn book and the 
co-products produced as part of the corn 
wet milling process, which are both 
underpinned by a number of judgements, 
have a material impact on the reported 
results of the Group.
The Committee received regular updates on the key commodity risks 
and the risk management framework in place to mitigate these risks. 
The Committee also considered the work performed by the external 
auditors before concluding that the judgements made in determining 
the valuations of the corn and co-products positions were 
appropriate. This will continue to be a key area of focus for the 
Committee in the coming year.
Taxation We operate and pay taxes in a number  
of jurisdictions, which requires the 
interpretation of complex tax law. As 
such, we make provision for potential 
direct tax exposures with local tax 
authorities and reassess this as 
necessary at the half-year and year-end. 
Our assessment is underpinned by a 
range of judgements from tax 
professionals and external advisors.
The Committee reviewed the Group’s principles and processes for 
managing tax risks during the year and reviewed the key judgements 
made in estimating the Group’s tax charge along with the key 
disclosures, including a statement of tax principles, set out on page 
34 and in Note 12. The Committee was satisfied that the judgements 
made in estimating the Group’s tax charge were reasonable, and that 
the disclosures were appropriate.
The key factors likely to affect the future tax charge, as well as the 
key risks and uncertainties, were considered and the Committee 
agreed the disclosure of these factors in this Annual Report.
The Committee considered the treatment of material tax 
transactions undertaken during the year, and concluded that the 
measurement and disclosure of these, including the transfer of 
certain sucralose intellectual property assets to the US and the UK 
deferred tax asset recognised following changes to our internal 
financing structure, were appropriate.
Retirement 
obligations
We have significant retirement benefit 
obligations in the UK and the US, 
including unfunded retirement medical 
plans in the US. A number of judgements 
have to be made when calculating the 
fair value of the Group’s legacy 
retirement obligations.
The Committee discussed and constructively challenged the 
assumptions proposed and methodologies used by management and 
considered reports from the external auditors before agreeing that 
the assumptions were reasonable. 
Impairments We test all goodwill for impairment 
annually, and, additionally, test all  
assets where there has been a previous 
impairment or where an indicator of 
potential impairment is considered  
to exist.
The Committee reviewed the annual goodwill impairment 
assessment. The future performance of the underlying businesses, 
including the discount rates used and forecast assumptions and 
sensitivities, were discussed and constructively challenged.  
The Committee concluded that the assumptions were acceptable, 
and the conclusions, including the net £13 million impairment in 
respect of Tate & Lyle Gemacom Tech Indústria e Comércio S.A., 
were appropriate.
Viability 
statement 
The Code provides that the Directors 
should explain in the Annual Report how 
they have assessed the prospects of the 
Group, including the appropriateness of 
the period used in this assessment.
The Committee discussed the appropriateness of the assessment 
period and the scenarios to stress-test the business model ahead  
of the full assessment by the Board. The Directors subsequently 
concluded that they have a reasonable expectation that the Group  
will be able to continue in operation and meet its liabilities as they  
fall due over the three-year period of their detailed assessment. 
Tenure of the external auditors
The Competition and Markets Authority’s order issued in 
October 2014 requires FTSE 350 companies to tender  
their statutory audit engagement at least every ten years.  
In addition to this, EU regulations require that audit firms  
of all EU companies listed on a regulated market rotate off 
after 20 years.
Under the transitional provisions attached to the EU rules,  
we would be required to change auditors for the next audit 
appointment after 17 June 2020. As set out in the introduction 
from the Committee Chairman, the process for an external 
audit tender has begun and our intention is to have the new 
auditors in place for the financial year ending 31 March 2019.
68 Tate & Lyle PLC Annual Report 2017 The Committee has recommended to the Board that PwC 
continues to act as auditors to the Group for the year to 31 
March 2018. PwC has indicated its willingness to continue in 
office; resolutions on the reappointment of PwC and 
authorising the Audit Committee on behalf of the Board to 
determine PwC’s remuneration will be proposed at the AGM.
The Audit Committee considers that the Company has 
complied with the Competition and Markets Authority’s 
Statutory Audit Services for Large Companies Market 
Investigation (Mandatory Use of Competitive Tender Processes 
and Audit Committee Responsibilities) Order 2014 for the 
financial year under review.
Internal audit – Group Audit and Assurance
Group Audit and Assurance is an internal review function that 
services the Board and all levels of management. It provides 
objective assurance to add value and improve the 
organisation’s operations. Its responsibilities include assessing 
the principal risks of the organisation and examining, 
evaluating and reporting on the adequacy and effectiveness of 
the systems of risk management and internal control as 
operated by management. Management remains responsible 
for identifying risks and for the design and operation of controls 
to manage risk. During the year, the Committee reviewed the 
remit, organisation, annual plan, resources and effectiveness of 
Group Audit and Assurance and concluded that the function 
continued to operate effectively. It is the intention to assess the 
effectiveness of the Group Audit and Assurance function using 
an external party in the 2018 financial year as the last third-
party review was undertaken in the 2014 financial year. 
Internal control and risk management
The Committee continued to receive and consider regular 
reports from management and the VP , Group Audit and 
Assurance on the effectiveness of the Group’s risk 
management system during the year.
The reports from the latter included the findings from reviews 
of internal financial controls and actions to address any 
weaknesses in those controls. The Committee also reviewed 
the operation of our independent confidential reporting line, 
Speak Up. Throughout the year, the Committee focused in 
particular on strengthening the financial control environment 
and the impact of this on the financial reporting processes.  
The Committee reviewed controls to mitigate fraud risk and the 
Group assurance map, a tool which sets out the assurance 
processes and the three lines of defence model. It also 
considered the results of the annual review of the effectiveness 
of internal financial reporting controls, which took into account 
the Group Risk Manager’s support to the risk management 
process, and then reported to the Board. Further details about 
this review are on page 62.

I am pleased to take on the role of Chairman of the 
Nominations Committee and to work with my fellow 
Committee members over the coming years to ensure that the 
Board continues to have the appropriate structure, size and 
composition to progress the delivery of the Group’s strategy.
After a year in which the Committee focused on Chairman 
succession and the appointment of a new non-executive 
director, Jeanne Johns, our focus this year will be on further 
strengthening our processes and planning for talent 
management and succession at and below the Board. 
I feel privileged to have joined a Board which is well balanced in 
terms of ethnic and gender diversity and clearly recognises the 
benefits that such diversity brings. The Board has considered 
the recent Hampton-Alexander Review into gender diversity 
and the Parker Review into ethnic diversity and will pay careful 
attention to these important reports when considering the 
effectiveness of our succession planning and talent 
management processes throughout the organisation.

Effectiveness
Sir Peter Gershon, the Committee Chairman up to 31 March 
2017, led a review of the Committee’s effectiveness and the 
output was discussed by the Committee. This concluded that 
the Committee continued to operate effectively.
Work undertaken during the year
The Committee maintains a calendar of items for consideration 
at each meeting and reviews and updates it regularly.
Board succession planning 
Appointment of Dr Gerry Murphy
After seven years as the Chairman of the Company, Sir Peter 
Gershon indicated his desire to begin the process to identify his 
successor. Liz Airey, the Senior Independent Director at the 
time, led the search. The Committee retained Spencer Stuart 
to assist it with the search. Spencer Stuart is a signatory to the 
Voluntary Code of Conduct for Executive Search Firms and has 
a good understanding of the Group’s business as it has 
previously assisted in the identification of individuals to fill 
non-executive director roles and other senior executive roles.
The Committee identified, in particular, the following attributes 
of potential candidates as highly desirable:
• City experience and competence
• international track record
• strong strategic and communication skills
• industry sector experience
together with the ability to devote the time necessary to  
the role.
Spencer Stuart prepared a ‘long list’ comprising a diverse 
range of potential candidates meeting the specifications.  
The search consultants and Liz Airey then identified a subset  
of this long list to meet face-to-face with a working party  
of the Nominations Committee. This working party then 
recommended the candidates who went through to a second 
round of meetings with other members of the Board and who 
were also given the opportunity to hold a due diligence meeting 
with Sir Peter Gershon and to meet members of the Executive 
Committee.
The Committee reviewed the output of the discussions held 
with the potential candidates and recommended the 
appointment of Dr Gerry Murphy to the Board from 1 January 
2017. Dr Murphy became the Chairman on 1 April 2017.
Corporate Governance continued
70 Tate & Lyle PLC Annual Report 2017 Appointment of Jeanne Johns
The Committee reviewed the succession needs of the Board 
and determined that it would be appropriate to seek an 
additional US-based non-executive director. 
The Committee retained Korn Ferry to assist it with the search. 
Korn Ferry is a signatory to the Voluntary Code of Conduct for 
Executive Search Firms.
Korn Ferry prepared a long list comprising a diverse range of 
potential candidates meeting the specification. The search 
consultants and the Chairman (Sir Peter Gershon) then 
identified a subset of this long list to meet face-to-face with the 
Chairman. Following these initial interviews, Sir Peter Gershon 
recommended a shortlist of candidates and the Committee set 
up a working party to interview the candidates.
The Committee subsequently discussed the results of these 
interviews and also reviewed the candidates’ anticipated ability 
to provide the necessary time commitment to Tate & Lyle. The 
Committee recommended that Jeanne Johns be appointed as 
an additional non-executive director. This recommendation, 
together with the proposed membership and chairmanship of 
the Corporate Responsibility Committee, were approved by the 
Board and Jeanne joined the Board on 26 October 2016.
Senior Independent Director
In addition, the Committee recommended that Douglas Hurt, 
with over six years of Board service and having very good 
experience of the UK market and institutional shareholders, 
should be appointed as Senior Independent Director with effect 
from 1 January 2017.
Company Secretary
Following the resignation of Lucie Gilbert, the Committee 
commenced a process to appoint a successor, using 
independent executive search firm, Hedley May. Claire-Marie 
O’Grady was appointed on 1 February 2017.
Director independence
The Committee is responsible for making recommendations to 
the Board concerning the independence of non-executive 
directors. The Code provides that the Board should determine 
whether there are relationships or circumstances which are 
likely to affect, or could appear to affect, a Director’s judgement 
and lists tenures in excess of nine years as a circumstance 
which may appear relevant to its determination. Liz Airey joined 
the Board in January 2007 and, as the Senior Independent 
Director, led the process to identify the successor for the 
Chairman. As previously announced, Ms Airey will be stepping 
down from the Board at the 2017 AGM and, therefore, will not 
be seeking re-election as a Director.
Board diversity
The Board believes that a diverse and inclusive culture is  
a driver of superior business performance, growth and 
innovation. The Board has a clear policy on diversity that 
acknowledges that the Board’s perspective and approach can 
be greatly enhanced through gender, age and cultural diversity, 
notwithstanding the overriding principle that each member, 
and potential member, of the Board must be able to 
demonstrate the skills, experience and knowledge required to 
contribute to the effectiveness of the Board. Wherever feasible, 
the Committee uses search firms who are signatories to the 
Voluntary Code of Conduct for Executive Search Firms which 
seeks to address gender diversity on boards and best practice 
for the related search processes.
As set out elsewhere in this report, when considering the 
candidates for non-executive directors the Committee looked 
at a number of different criteria, including gender, age and 
cultural diversity and personal attributes such as thinking style. 
This was reflected in the long lists and shortlists of possible 
candidates. 
With regard to the specific issue of gender diversity, the Board 
welcomes the decision not to impose in the UK quotas 
regarding gender balance. As at the date of this report, the 
Board comprises the Chairman, two executive directors and 
eight non-executive directors. Female representation (four 
Directors) equates to 36% of the Board.
Succession planning
The Committee reviewed succession plans for senior executive 
roles and the progress of action plans to address any gaps. The 
Committee continues to review progress on a regular basis.
Performance evaluation
The Committee evaluated the performance of each member of 
the Executive Committee and reported its conclusions to the 
Remuneration Committee.

STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS USEFUL INFORMATION Corporate Governance continued
Safety is the primary focus of  
the Corporate Responsibility 
Committee. 
Dear shareholder
This is my first report as the chairman of the Corporate 
Responsibility Committee. On behalf of the Committee, I would 
like to thank William Camp for his significant contribution to 
the work of the Committee during his tenure and for the time 
he has taken to share his knowledge and experience of the 
Company with me during this period of transition. As we  
move forward, we will continue to focus on the key areas  
of responsibility – safety, product quality, cyber security  
and sustainability.
The Group has no higher priority than safety and safety is the 
primary focus of the Corporate Responsibility Committee. 
Sadly, our safety performance during the year was over-
shadowed by an industrial accident at one of our grain 
elevators in the US, in which one of our employees and a local 
farmer died. As well as investigating the root causes of this 
tragic incident, the executive management team, with the full 
support of the Board and the Corporate Responsibility 
Committee, instigated a comprehensive end-to-end review of 
the Group’s safety programme and safety culture. This ongoing 
review started in January and is being supported by leading 
external experts in safety. As part of their review, these experts 
will visit over 30 manufacturing and other locations. The review 
will be completed in the summer with a full report to 
management and the Board. Throughout the review process, 
the Committee will have regular updates on key themes 
emerging from it, and will review the actions taken by 
management to address the review’s findings. 
As part of my induction as a new Board member, I visited the 
Mattoon and Coles grain elevators after the industrial accident 
to observe the revised processes and targeted investments 
being implemented there. I also visited the Decatur, Lafayette 
South and Sagamore plants and was able to see first-hand how 
committed the teams there are to safety and how receptive they 
are to safety risk management improvements. Implementation 
of the comprehensive Group-wide safety review will enable the 
next level of safety risk management.
Before taking over as Chair of the Corporate Responsibility 
Committee, I held meetings with the President Global 
Operations; VP , Safety; the Group VP and CIO; VP , Group Audit 
and Assurance; and VP , Sustainability to discuss items on the 
Committee’s agenda. I propose to hold meetings of this nature 
with regular management attendees of the Committee and 
other senior operational leaders in advance of future 
Committee meetings. I believe that these meetings will provide 
me with an invaluable opportunity to discuss risk areas and 
help me to ensure that the Committee has the appropriate 
information to discharge its responsibilities effectively. 
Looking ahead, the Committee’s priority for the 2018 financial 
year will be safety, focusing on the effective implementation  
of the recommendations from the Group-wide safety review, 
including the external experts’ report. We will also continue  
to devote significant time to product quality, cyber security  
and sustainability.

Effectiveness
The Committee Chairman and Company Secretary led a review 
of the Committee’s effectiveness and the output was discussed 
by the Committee. This concluded that the Committee 
continued to operate effectively and identified a number of 
areas for increased focus during the forthcoming financial year.
Work undertaken during the year
The Committee maintains a calendar of items for consideration 
at each meeting. This is regularly reviewed and updated. The 
work undertaken by the Committee in the 2017 financial year 
fell under the following main areas: 
Safety 
At each of its meetings, the Committee discussed an update 
from the VP , Safety covering matters such as the development 
and implementation of initiatives to refresh the Group’s 
approach to personal safety. In addition to the updates into the 
incident at one of our US grain elevators in 2016, during the 
course of the year, the Committee identified areas for additional 
safety reporting to be produced by management for review at 
routine Committee meetings.
Product quality
The VP , Global Quality updated the Committee on the status of 
global quality key performance indicators; regulatory priorities 
for the quality organisation; and the result of certain recall 
simulation activities in the business.
Cyber security
The Committee is responsible for overseeing the policies and 
systems to address cyber security threats. Updates on cyber 
security matters were provided to the Committee twice during 
the year in addition to regular updates to the Board. 
Diversity and inclusion
The Committee received an update on the actions taken to 
embed the Group’s diversity and inclusion initiatives, and the 
priorities of management for the next 12 months. 
Business practices
The Committee considered the effectiveness of the 
independent confidential reporting line. Further information on 
this is on page 63. The Committee also reviewed the Company’s 
Modern Slavery Statement which was subsequently approved 
by the Board.
Environment
The VP , Sustainability provided the Committee with updates on 
the Group’s environmental performance and initiatives and the 
Committee approved new targets for 2020 (see page 48).
Community
The Committee discussed the delivery of the annual charitable 
and community involvement programme and the proposed 
programme for the year ending 31 March 2018.
Internal control and risk management
In September, the Committee reviewed progress made in the 
Company’s business continuity management programme and 
those areas of focus for continued improvement over the 
following 12 months. 
During the year, the Committee received regular reports from 
management and the VP , Group Audit and Assurance in 
respect of the policies, systems and controls in place in respect 
of the risks falling within the Committee’s remit. In addition, 
the Committee reviewed the output from the annual review of 
the effectiveness of controls falling within its terms of reference 
and then reported to the Board on this review.

As Chairman of the Remuneration Committee I am pleased to 
present our Remuneration Report for the financial year ended 
31 March 2017.
This introduction explains how we made decisions during  
the year, and summarises key points from the Report,  
including performance and incentive plan outcomes,  
and Committee activities. 
Business performance context
As you will read in the introductory statements in this  
Annual Report, we are pleased to report a year of strong 
performance with overall results reflecting delivery against  
our strategy and progress towards our 2020 Ambition. 
Both business divisions delivered profit growth in constant 
currency, with Bulk Ingredients (BI) delivering particularly 
strong results, driven by good commercial and manufacturing 
performance. Speciality Food Ingredients (SFI) performed well, 
delivering profit growth and margin expansion and continues to 
take the necessary actions to strengthen its focus on customer 
service and commercial execution. The innovation pipeline

1 Percentage changes are in constant currency.
Incentive outcomes for the year 
As set out in this Report, headline incentive outcomes for the 
year were as follows: 
• Annual bonus plan: awards for the year reflect strong 
financial performance, with Group profit and cash 
performance ahead of stretching targets set at the start of 
the year. Actual awards, at below maximum levels, reflect an 
assessment of safety performance
• Performance Share Plan (PSP): awards made in 2014 
reached the end of their three-year performance period.  
Our adjusted return on capital employed in the year to 
31 March 2017 exceeded the maximum vesting requirement 
and is in excess of our cost of capital. EPS targets for the 
three-year period have not been achieved. Accordingly, a 
vesting level of 50% of maximum was achieved. 
Total remuneration outcomes are above ’target’ but below 
‘maximum’ policy levels, which the Committee considers to be 
consistent with the underlying financial health and 
performance of the business.
Remuneration Policy and shareholder approval
Following a careful review, we believe that our current 
Remuneration Policy and approach (with the changes made 
last year to the operation of the PSP) remain appropriate in the 
context of our business strategy and our shareholders’ 
expectations. Accordingly, we are not proposing to make any 
material changes to the Policy which was formally approved by 
shareholders in 2014. The Policy presented in this Report is 
therefore essentially the same, although we have taken the 
opportunity to simplify some elements.

STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS USEFUL INFORMATION The Committee formed this view thoughtfully, taking a number 
of factors into account, as described below.
Since the 2014 Policy was adopted, we have continued to 
engage proactively with shareholders
• We have engaged proactively with shareholders over 
successive years, and I am pleased to report that the level of 
shareholder support for our core remuneration framework 
remains strong (most recent policy and report resolutions 
enjoying support of 97.9% and 93.0% respectively)
• We made specific changes to the long-term incentive (PSP) 
framework last year, which were the subject of detailed 
consultation with shareholders, and which align well with 
our business strategy and long-term ambition for growth
• We consulted ahead of the publication of this report with a 
broad group including many of our largest 30 shareholders, 
offering meetings with me, to explain our intended approach 
in reviewing the Policy, and to capture any feedback.
We have been responsive to prevailing investor and 
governance themes
Since the current policy was adopted, the Committee has been 
attentive to governance developments and changes in 
shareholders’ expectations, and our practice has evolved over 
that time to adopt several governance-friendly features, for 
example: 
• We were early adopters of claw back and malus provisions 
• Our personal shareholding requirements continue to be 
more demanding than typical (four times salary for the Chief 
Executive; three times salary for other executive directors 
and Executive Committee members) 
• We have introduced a holding period for PSP awards, so a 
combination of a three-year vesting period and two-year 
holding period means that awards made since 2016 have a 
five-year time horizon
• A ‘dividend underpin’ supplements the existing financial 
performance underpin, providing the Committee discretion 
to reduce the vesting outcome in certain circumstances, and 
providing shareholders with additional comfort that PSP 
awards will only vest if dividends over the period conform 
with our Policy
• We also remain committed to maintaining the quality of our 
remuneration-related disclosure (for example, disclosing 
bonus targets in full).
We intentionally operate a simple overall remuneration 
framework 
While the regulatory disclosures are detailed, our remuneration 
framework remains simple: 
• The components of remuneration (salary and benefits, an 
annual bonus and a single long-term incentive plan) each 
have a clear purpose, and incentive plan metrics are aligned 
with our business strategy, and with the successful delivery 
of long-term financial growth and returns to shareholders, 
and are consistent with our 2020 Ambition
• We maintain a strong alignment with shareholders’ interests 
by requiring executive directors to maintain significant 
personal shareholdings through the post-vesting holding 
period applicable to PSP awards and through safeguards 
such as malus and claw back provisions which apply to 
incentive awards following their release.
No material changes to Policy; retaining flexibility to reflect 
the needs of the business 
There are no material changes to the Policy, although we have 
simplified the wording in some areas (for example, the 
description of how leavers are treated), and tidied up a few 
housekeeping matters with input from our external advisors 
(for example, to ensure that incidental benefits are 
appropriately captured within the Policy).
Remuneration Report and Remuneration 
Policy for the year ahead 
Our Remuneration Policy was approved by shareholders at the 
2014 AGM with 97.9% of votes in favour. Changes to the 
operations of the PSP (in existing Policy) were endorsed by 
shareholders through a 93.0% vote in favour of the 
Remuneration Report in 2016. The Committee is satisfied that 
this Policy and approach provide strong alignment between 
Group performance and the remuneration of executive 
directors. 
The information regarding Directors’ remuneration is 
presented in two Reports: the first relates to our Remuneration 
Policy and the second relates to the way in which our Policy 
has been implemented during the year.
Resolutions to approve each of these Reports will be proposed 
at the AGM on 27 July 2017. Our intention is that the Policy 
approved by shareholders will apply for a period of three years 
from the date of the AGM, and will not be put to an annual 
shareholder vote.

Key Committee activities during the year
In addition to the responsibilities of the Committee  
(summarised on page 87), during the year, the Committee: 
• Completed our consultation with shareholders regarding 
the changes to PSP metrics which were endorsed by 
shareholders at the 2016 AGM. The Committee 
specifically deferred the grant of 2016 PSP awards until 
after the AGM to ensure shareholder support for the  
new arrangements. We were pleased to note that the 
Directors’ Remuneration Report resolution was strongly 
supported, with 93% of shareholders voting in favour
• Scheduled additional time for Committee meetings,  
and the annual agenda incorporates a programme of 
regular updates on market, investor and governance/
regulatory topics
• Continued to engage with other stakeholders on director 
remuneration topics (including the Investment 
Association Working Group and BEIS consultations 
on remuneration)
• Reviewed the effectiveness of changes previously made 
to the Annual Bonus Plan to ensure stronger  
links between our annual planning process and the 
establishment of bonus targets; and adopted SFI volume 
growth as a quantitative strategic ‘top line’ metric in 
place of ‘net sales less cost of raw materials’ for the year 
ahead, to place a greater focus on the necessary actions 
to grow the SFI business in pursuit of our 2020 Ambition.
In January 2017, the Committee Chairman led the annual 
review of the Committee’s effectiveness. The review 
concluded that the Committee appropriately fulfilled its 
role and carried out its duties against the responsibilities 
described in its terms of reference, noting also the 
additional time the Committee had spent during the  
year considering external updates on market and 
governance developments.
We were pleased to note that our Remuneration Report 
published last year was awarded the Building Public  
Trust in Corporate Reporting Award for executive 
remuneration reporting in the FTSE 250; and, this year,  
we have sought to preserve our standard of disclosure  
for the benefit of our stakeholders.

STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS USEFUL INFORMATION Remuneration strategy and key principles 
The Group’s remuneration strategy and supporting principles, which apply consistently to employees, managers and 
executives, are summarised in the table below. 
Directors’ Remuneration Report continued
Directors’ Remuneration Policy Report 
Introduction 
This Report sets out the Company’s policy in relation to Directors’ remuneration. 
Following a careful review, as described in the Committee Chairman’s letter (see page 74), the Committee believes that our 
current Remuneration Policy and approach (with the changes made last year to the operation of the PSP , within the scope of our 
existing policy) remains appropriate in the context of our business strategy and our shareholders’ expectations. Accordingly, we 
are not proposing to make any material changes to the Policy which was formally approved by shareholders in 2014. The Policy 
presented in this report is therefore essentially the same, although we have taken the opportunity to simplify some elements.
Subject to shareholder approval at the AGM on 27 July 2017, the Committee will operate within this Policy from that date. 
The Committee retains discretion on specific aspects of policy and implementation, as described in the Remuneration Policy, 
along with an overriding discretion to determine bonus outcomes and judge the level at which share awards vest, to ensure that 
payments are consistent with the underlying financial health and performance of the business, within the maximum opportunity 
stated in the Policy tables. The Committee may make minor changes to the Policy without seeking shareholder approval, for 
example to benefit the administration of arrangements, or to take account of changes in legislation. Any such changes would be 
disclosed in the relevant Annual Report. 
Remuneration strategy Key principles
The Group’s 
remuneration strategy 
is to provide packages 
that enable the Group  
to recruit, retain and 
motivate high-calibre 
individuals in the 
markets in which  
we operate so that  
we may deliver  
superior operational 
performance and 
outstanding financial 
results 
• Base pay and benefits are referenced to the comparative local market, taking 
account of company size and operations 
• For all employees, our pay for performance framework provides for meaningful 
differentiation in salary progression and opportunities for career progression, based 
on each individual’s contribution
• The total package opportunity should provide meaningful rewards for superior 
performance and encourage the achievement of genuinely stretching short-term 
and long-term objectives 
• Below executive level, key individuals who have a specific accountability for driving 
annual and longer-term performance may be selected to participate variously in 
our sales incentive plan, the annual bonus plan, and the Performance Share Plan
• Alignment with shareholders’ long-term interests is carefully preserved, for 
example, through: a significant proportion of pay being based on performance; 
effective governance around remuneration decisions; a considered approach to 
setting performance targets; the adoption of shareholding guidelines at senior 
executive levels; and malus and claw back provisions on incentive awards
• All aspects of remuneration are designed to encourage a focus on long-term, 
sustained performance and risk management
• Our approach is intended to be equitable and transparent and operate across the 
Group, recognising that we recruit talented individuals and operate in an 
international market
• Outcomes must be achieved in a way that is consistent with the Group’s Values and 
Code of Ethics, and that fosters sustainable, profitable growth

A clear link between our long-term business strategy and executive directors’ remuneration
The Group’s remuneration arrangements place a clear emphasis on driving Group performance, through incentives that are 
directly linked to key performance indicators (KPIs) which are aligned with our business strategy. In this way, we maintain a keen 
focus on delivering long-term growth and value for shareholders.
The table below summarises the performance metrics that we use to measure the Group’s progress against our strategy, and 
describes how these link to remuneration arrangements.

the Annual Bonus Plan. A 
volume metric will apply 
from the 2018 financial year, 
being a more effective 
measure of growth

We operate in an international context
The charts below illustrate the international nature of our business. Although we are UK-listed and headquartered in London, UK, 
a very significant proportion of our sales, employees and shareholders are based outside the UK. Accordingly, it is important that 
our remuneration arrangements are competitive in that international context.

Base salary
Providing competitive 
fixed remuneration to 
attract executives of 
the required calibre 
• Salaries are referenced to the comparative local market 
taking account of company size and operations, the 
individual’s skills, experience, personal performance and 
circumstances (for example, following promotion into a 
new or expanded role). 
• Increases are typically limited to 
the general increase for Group 
employees in the same location. 
• Base salary reviews take into account increases awarded to employees below executive level, 
and the impact on pension and other consequences of increases. They reflect personal 
performance consistent with the approach applicable to employees generally.
• No changes to the policy have been made.
• The reference to incidental benefits 
clarifies that directors may participate in 
benefits that are generally available to local 
employees; and provides for the settlement 
of expenses incurred in the normal course 
of business.
Benefits
• Benefits are provided in line with comparative local 
market practice and may include, for example: car (or 
allowance), health insurance, life cover, and retirement 
benefits.
Incidental (situation-dependent) benefits may include:
• Reimbursement of out-of-pocket expenses incurred in the 
course of business, and settlement of taxes in accordance 
with HMRC rules
• Participation in benefits generally available to the local 
employee population (including for example HMRC-
approved sharesave plans)
• Relocation benefits, including healthcare
• Payment in lieu of dividends on specific awards.
• Retirement and/or cash benefits 
in lieu of pension are referenced to 
external market practice. 
• The value of non-cash benefits is 
determined by the cost of 
provision, e.g. third-party health 
insurance premiums.
• Receipt of any benefits would be in 
accordance with policies applicable 
more generally to employees in the 
same location.
• Retirement benefits are provided by way of defined contribution or equivalent cash 
arrangements. Contribution levels are 35% of salary for the Chief Executive and 25% of salary 
for the Chief Financial Officer, reflecting contractual commitments on appointment.
• Employment and incidental benefits are not performance-related. 
• Payment in lieu of dividends may apply to specific awards where any applicable conditions have 
been satisfied at vesting. Accordingly, no additional performance conditions apply.
• No performance conditions are attached to sharesave awards because the sharesave plan is an 
all-employee scheme.

• The bonus award may comprise cash and deferred shares, 
depending on the level of award.
• The final bonus award is made at the Committee’s 
discretion. Subject to the overall maximum, the 
Committee may make appropriate adjustments to ensure 
that the bonus outcomes are a fair reflection of the 
underlying performance of the Company and may also 
take into account factors such as the Group’s safety 
performance, operational performance, and personal 
performance.
• Target is 50% of salary for  
the Chief Financial Officer and 
75% for the Chief Executive
• Maximum cash bonus is 100% of 
salary.
• Maximum total bonus opportunity 
is 175% of salary, with any award 
over 100% paid in shares, which 
are deferred for two years.
• Deferred shares carry the right to 
receive a cash payment in lieu of 
the dividend during the deferral 
period.
• Key financial performance metrics are selected by the Committee. Additionally, the Committee 
may select quantifiable metrics aligned with strategic and/or operational objectives on a 
personal or collective basis.
• Targets for each metric are set at the start of each financial year, taking account of the business 
strategy, performance in previous years, market expectations and the prevailing economic 
climate.
• Financial performance has the greatest weighting.
• A minimum profit hurdle applies before any bonus is payable against any of the metrics.
• Malus and claw back provisions apply: bonus payments and shares may be recouped in specific 
circumstances during the two-year period following the end of the financial year to which the 
bonus relates.
• No changes to the policy have been made.

• Awards will only vest to participants if demanding financial 
performance requirements have been achieved over a 
performance period of at least three financial years 
commencing with the financial year in which the award  
is made.
• A two-year post-vesting holding period follows the 
three-year performance period, so awards to executive 
directors have a five-year horizon.
• Flexibility to make awards of up to 
300% of base salary (at the time of 
award) to ensure market 
competitiveness and taking 
account of the Group’s 
performance.
• The award will lapse entirely if 
threshold performance targets are 
not achieved.
• Only 15% of any award made to 
executive directors vests for 
achieving threshold performance.
• The following performance metrics were adopted for awards from 2016:
 – 25%: SFI adjusted operating profit (excluding SPLENDA
®
 Sucralose) 
 – 25%: Group adjusted profit before tax
 – 50%: adjusted return on capital employed (ROCE).
• These metrics are key determinants of shareholder value creation, because they reflect: the 
effectiveness of strategic investment decisions; the focus on growing our SFI business; and the 
growth in financial value of the whole Group. If material changes to the metrics are proposed, 
the Committee would consult with key shareholders in advance of making a new award.
• Targets are reviewed by the Committee ahead of each annual grant, to ensure they remain 
appropriately stretching over the performance period.
• The Committee must be satisfied that the level of vesting is justified by the broader underlying 
financial performance of the Company.
• A dividend underpin gives the Committee discretion to reduce PSP vesting if dividends over the 
performance period do not conform to the dividend policy.

STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS USEFUL INFORMATION Incorporation of previously approved 
remuneration policy statements
We intend that provisions consistent with previously disclosed 
directors’ remuneration policies and/or incentive plans 
previously approved by shareholders will continue to apply  
after shareholders have approved the resolution to adopt the 
Remuneration Policy set out in this report. Such provisions  
will allow, without limitation:
• The honouring of contractual commitments entered into 
before the Policy takes effect, or before an individual was 
subject to this Policy
• The satisfaction of awards and/or commitments made in 
relation to incentive plan awards (providing they were 
consistent with the Policy in effect at the time the original 
award/commitment was made).
Executive directors’ external appointments
The Board believes that the Group can benefit from executive 
directors holding external non-executive directorships. Such 
appointments are subject to approval by the Board and are 
normally restricted to one position for each executive director. 
Fees may be retained by the executive director concerned.
Other incentive plan provisions
• Potential impact of mergers and acquisitions or other 
corporate activity: in the context of a merger or acquisition, 
or other relevant corporate activity, any potential impact on 
the incentive plans would be specifically considered by the 
Committee. In such circumstances, the Committee retains 
the authority to vary the performance target or the vesting 
outcome to ensure that outcomes are equitable for both the 
participant and shareholders. 
• Change of control and voting: all the Company’s share plans 
contain provisions relating to a change of control. 
Outstanding awards would normally vest and become 
exercisable on a change of control, subject to the satisfaction 
of any performance conditions at that time, and in proportion 
to the time served during the performance period.
Service contracts
The Group’s policy regarding executive directors’ service 
contracts and appointment terms is to take account of market 
practice, and to ensure that provisions in relation to notice 
periods or termination payments are not excessive. Our policy 
is also to ensure that contracts provide appropriate protection 
for the Group, for example, in relation to restrictions on 
competition, solicitation of customers or employees, and  
the protection of intellectual property.
Executive directors are employed under service contracts 
commencing on dates as follows: Javed Ahmed (Chief 
Executive) –10 October 2009; Nick Hampton (Chief Financial 
Officer) – 1 September 2014. The contracts provide for six 
months’ notice from the executive and 12 months’ notice  
from the Group. 
Directors’ Remuneration Report continued
Terms of appointment
The Chairman and non-executive directors have letters of 
appointment and do not have service contracts or notice 
periods. Under the terms of their appointment, they are 
usually expected to serve on the Board for a maximum  
of nine years, subject to their annual re-election by 
shareholders. The Company Chairman and non-executive 
directors receive a fee for their services, do not participate in 
the Group’s incentive or pension schemes, do not receive any 
other benefits, and have no right to compensation if their 
appointment is terminated.
Chairman and non-executive directors’ fees
Non-executive directors’ fees (excluding the Chairman) are 
reviewed annually by the Chairman and executive directors 
of the Board. The Chairman’s fee is reviewed annually by the 
Committee (excluding the Chairman).
Aggregate fees depend on the responsibilities assumed  
by each non-executive director. A basic fee is paid to the 
Chairman, to the Senior Independent Director and to each 
non-executive director. Supplemental fees are paid to each 
Committee chairman. Accordingly, supplemental fees are 
paid to the chairmen of the Audit, Corporate Responsibility 
and Remuneration Committees, and of the Research 
Advisory Group, to reflect the extra responsibilities required 
by each of these positions. 
Increases in fees arising from the normal annual review will 
generally be limited to the market increase applicable to UK 
employees generally. However, a higher or lower increase 
may be awarded to ensure that fees paid are commensurate 
with those paid by other UK-listed companies. Fees are set 
at a level to retain individuals with the necessary experience 
and ability to make a substantial contribution to the Group. 
The Company may reimburse out-of-pocket expenses 
incurred in the normal course of business and settle taxes 
on these in accordance with HMRC rules.
Remuneration Policy for the Chairman  
and non-executive directors
Other Policy items 
82 Tate & Lyle PLC Annual Report 2017 Service contracts for executive directors and letters of 
appointment for the Chairman and non-executive directors are 
available for inspection at the Company’s registered office.
Beyond the items disclosed in this report, there are no further 
obligations on the Company which could give rise to a 
remuneration or loss-of-office payment to a Director.
Policy on the terms of directors’ appointment 
To ensure the continued growth and success of the business 
over time, the Company must have the flexibility to appoint new 
individuals to the Board, either by way of internal promotion or 
external appointment, on terms that are sufficient to attract 
and motivate individuals of the highest calibre. 
The following key principles describe our intended approach in 
these circumstances (and are consistent with the principles 
that apply to the broader employee population).
• The starting point for structuring any package on 
appointment will be the annual remuneration framework 
under the Remuneration Policy that has been approved by 
shareholders and is current at the time of the appointment. 
• To respond to specific circumstances and/or to allow for 
differences in practice over time and by location, the 
Committee retains flexibility outside the Policy to provide 
market-referenced benefits which are considered necessary 
or appropriate to the role, for example in relation to 
healthcare and insurance, transport and security, and 
provision for retirement.
• Where an appointment requires an individual to relocate, 
internationally or otherwise, the Company may agree to 
make payment(s) to offset certain expenses incurred as a 
consequence of relocation or may provide benefits in line 
with our global/domestic mobility policy, on appointment and 
on an ongoing basis, depending on the circumstances. Such 
benefits may include, for example travel, relocation and 
tax-related assistance, and similar repatriation benefits in 
due course. 
• The current Policy provides for a maximum level of variable 
remuneration that is equivalent to 475% of base salary in the 
financial year of appointment. This is consistent with the 
aggregate current maxima under the Annual Bonus Plan 
and the Performance Share Plan. The Committee retains 
flexibility to alter the balance between short-term and 
long-term elements within this overall maximum, and 
awards may be made on different terms. 
• Where an internal candidate is appointed, contractual 
commitments that have been made prior to appointment to 
the Board, along with any benefits and/or incentive awards 
that have been awarded at that time, may remain in effect 
and be honoured, even if they would not otherwise be 
consistent with the shareholder-approved Remuneration 
Policy in effect at the time.
• To secure the appointment of a suitable external candidate, 
the Committee retains the flexibility to provide additional 
compensation for the value of incentive awards or other 
benefits that are forfeited on leaving a former employer.  
In such circumstances, the Committee may make use of 
cash and/or shares, as it considers appropriate in the 
circumstances. The Committee will exercise careful 
judgement in formulating the terms on which such a 
compensatory award will be made, taking into account the 
form of award(s) that are forfeited, the timeframes over 
which they may otherwise have been earned, and any 
performance conditions that would have applied, with the 
principle that such awards be made on a like-for-like basis.
This Policy is intended to enable the Committee to structure  
an offer on terms that it considers to be in the best interests  
of the Company and our shareholders. Depending on the 
circumstances, and any restrictions or requirements that  
may apply, the Company may consult with key shareholders  
as part of this process and/or disclose terms on which a new 
appointment is made through a regulatory information service.
Policy on payments in connection with loss  
of office
It is the Company’s policy that executive directors are normally 
employed on contracts that provide for not more than 
12 months’ notice from the Company and at least six months’ 
notice from the executive. To protect the Group’s interests, 
restrictive covenants (non-compete/non-solicitation) apply for a 
period of 12 months following termination, less any period of 
‘garden leave’. The Chief Executive and Chief Financial Officer 
are each employed on contracts consistent with this policy.
The treatment of executive directors leaving the Company is 
designed to support a smooth transition from the Company, 
encouraging an orderly transfer of responsibilities, and taking 
into account the interests of shareholders in securing the 
sustained performance of the business beyond the executive’s 
departure. At the same time, the Committee is mindful of the 
need to avoid providing any element of reward for failure.
Termination for dishonesty or misconduct or poor performance 
are circumstances in which the executive director would retain 
only the minimum contractual entitlements on departure.  
In these circumstances no bonus award would be made, and 
unvested deferred shares or performance share awards would 
lapse. Dishonesty or misconduct may lead to the operation of 
malus and/or claw back provisions.
An executive director’s departure in compassionate 
circumstances such as death or permanent disability would 
generally result in the most beneficial terms being received,  
as summarised below.
If an executive director departs from the Company in other 
circumstances, the treatment would be considered at the 
Committee’s discretion and approved on a case-by-case basis, 
in keeping with the principles above. Such circumstances 
would potentially result in treatment that is more favourable 
than the contractual minimum but no more generous than that 
which applies under the compassionate circumstances 
mentioned above.

STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS USEFUL INFORMATION Directors’ Remuneration Report continued
Element of remuneration Treatment in compassionate circumstances (e.g. death or permanent disability)
Salary and benefits Paid or provided pro-rata to the termination date.
Annual bonus award or  
Performance Share Plan vesting
Any bonus or the vesting of Performance Share Plan award(s) will normally  
be considered and approved based on the extent to which the original performance 
targets are assessed to have been met at the relevant year-end, reduced  
pro-rata for time over the relevant financial year(s) prior to the termination date. 
The Committee retains the flexibility to approve the timing and value of any award 
on a different basis, depending on the circumstances (for example to release 
awards on cessation in the case of death/disability).
Deferred bonus awards and Performance 
Share Plan awards subject to a 
holding period
Deferred bonus awards may continue in effect, or be released early at the 
Committee’s discretion, depending on the circumstances. The post-vesting holding 
period applicable to Performance Share Plan awards will cease on termination 
of employment.
Provisions for payments in lieu of notice,  
and requirements for mitigation
The Company has the option to make a payment in lieu of notice in relation to the 
fixed elements of remuneration only (base salary, pension, and contractual 
benefits). Depending on the circumstances, such a payment may be subject to a 
duty of mitigation. The Chief Financial Officer’s contract gives the Company the 
contractual right to phase the payments and to reduce them if the executive 
mitigates his loss. Other elements of remuneration described in this table are not 
affected by these provisions.
In addition to contractual rights to any payment on loss of office, any employee, including executive directors, may have statutory 
and/or common law or other rights to certain additional payments, for example in a redundancy situation. Similarly, additional 
consideration may be provided, if necessary, to secure specific agreements following separation (for example an enhanced 
non-compete provision) that protect the Group’s interests.
Depending on the role and circumstances of departure, a director who has been relocated may be repatriated in accordance  
with previously agreed terms. The Company may pay some or all of the costs incurred by the executive director in respect  
of legal, financial, outplacement or other relevant personal advisory services and/or expenses in connection with relocation.  
The Committee will approve such arrangements on a case-by-case basis, with a view to maintaining compliance with regulatory 
requirements and consistency with internal Company policies that may apply.
Consideration of shareholders’ views
The Committee (led by the Committee chairman) engages with our major institutional shareholders each year specifically on 
remuneration topics, alongside the Board’s wider-ranging shareholder engagement programme.
The Committee also receives regular updates on investors’ views and corporate governance matters. These lines of 
communication ensure that emerging best practice principles are factored into the Committee’s decision making.
During 2016, the Committee chairman engaged with many of our 30 largest institutional shareholders and representatives, 
primarily to consult on proposed changes to the Performance Share Plan (PSP). 
The Committee has been attentive to the need for simplification of pay structures and the need for transparent communication in 
relation to remuneration decisions, alongside the detailed remuneration principles issued by many institutional investors and 
representative bodies. These perspectives have guided the Committee’s thinking through the year, and informed our decisions.
Our approach to remuneration has been relatively consistent since 2010, evolving over the intervening period to remain closely 
aligned with executional priorities and strategy, including our 2020 Ambition which was launched in 2015 (resulting in changes to 
performance metrics in the annual bonus and PSP); and to keep in step with good practice in relation to features that improve the 
alignment with and protect shareholders’ interests. These include adopting malus and claw back provisions in 2013, and 
incorporating a two-year post-vesting share holding period and dividend underpin for PSP awards in 2016.
Shareholders overwhelmingly approved the continuing use of the PSP as our long-term incentive, with changes to the metrics in 
2016. Shareholders formally approved the current Remuneration Policy at the AGM in 2014 (97.9% in favour). Our intention is that 
the Policy approved by shareholders at the 2017 AGM will apply for a period of three years from that date.
84 Tate & Lyle PLC Annual Report 2017 1 Annual bonus shows cash and deferred shares. No bonus is paid at or below threshold; the target opportunity is 75% of base salary for the Chief Executive and 50% for 
the Chief Financial Officer, while the maximum is 175%.
2 The maximum award is 300% of base salary. 15% vests at threshold, and the ‘target’ shown is half-way between threshold and stretch (i.e. 57.5% of the maximum).
Statement of consideration of employment conditions elsewhere in the Group
The principles on which we base remuneration decisions for executive directors (as described on page 78) are congruent with 
those on which we base remuneration decisions for all employees. In particular, the Committee takes into account the general  
pay and employment conditions of other employees of the Group when making decisions on executive directors’ remuneration.  
This includes considering the levels of base salary increase for employees below executive level, and ensuring that the same 
principles apply in setting performance targets for executive directors’ incentives as for other employees of the Group. The 
Committee also reviews information on bonus payments and share awards made to the wider management group when 
determining awards and outcomes at executive director level.

Committee advisor
We appointed Deloitte LLP as our external advisor following a review and competitive tender process during 2012. As part of its 
annual processes, the Committee considered and confirmed that advice received during the year from Deloitte LLP was objective 
and independent. Deloitte LLP is a signatory to the Remuneration Consultants’ Code of Conduct; this gives the Committee 
additional confidence that the advice received is objective and independent of conflicts of interest. Fees charged by Deloitte LLP 
for the provision of remuneration advice to the Committee amounted to £59,100 for the year ended 31 March 2017, with fees being 
charged on a time incurred basis. During the year, Deloitte LLP also provided services to the rest of the Group on corporate 
finance, consulting, systems, tax compliance and accounting.

Main responsibilities of the Remuneration Committee
The main responsibilities of the Committee include:
• Assessing the appropriateness of executive remuneration in the context of the Group’s strategy and priorities as well as 
overall competitiveness, taking into account data from independent, external sources
• Setting the detailed remuneration of the executive directors, designated members of senior management, and the 
Company Chairman (in consultation with the Chief Executive), including: base salary or fees; annual bonus; long-term 
incentives; benefits; and contractual terms
• Setting performance targets for awards made to senior executives under the annual bonus plan and the long-term 
incentive plan, and reviewing performance outcomes
• Reviewing the broader operation of the annual bonus and Performance Share Plans, including participation and overall 
award levels
• Reviewing its own effectiveness each year.
The Committee has a formal calendar of items for consideration. The Committee’s terms of reference, which are reviewed 
annually, are available on the Company’s website, www.tateandlyle.com.

1 No changes to benefit policies were made in respect of the Chief Executive or employees during the year. The percentage change in the employee benefits figure is the 
result of differences in employee participation levels and changes in the cost of insured benefits, including healthcare. The increase in the Chief Executive’s benefits figure 
reflects the increased cost of international healthcare since the position was originally established on appointment in 2009, driven by periodic premium renewals and the 
rates based on age and medical inflation trends over time (as described on page 76 of last year’s report).
2 The broader employee population refers to a global population of salaried employees for salary comparison and the UK employee population for the benefits comparison, 
reflecting the context in which executive directors’ salaries and benefits are determined. For the bonus comparisons, it refers to the global group of participants in the 
annual bonus plan so that the combination of business performance across our divisions that contributes to the Group’s results is appropriately represented.

88 Tate & Lyle PLC Annual Report 2017 Annual bonus
Overview
The bonus structure described here applied during the year ended 31 March 2017 and will be retained for the year ending 
31 March 2018, with a change to the top-line sales/growth metric, as described below.
The bonus is based on performance against three objectives: profitability; sales performance; and operating cash flow. Before any 
bonus is payable, a minimum level of profit has to be achieved by the Group, regardless of performance against the other metrics.
For each performance metric, there is a corresponding multiplier, which varies between threshold, target and stretch levels of 
performance. Once the minimum profit threshold is achieved, bonuses are calculated by applying the multipliers, which have the 
effect of increasing or decreasing the value of the bonus depending on performance against each metric in turn.
At target level of performance, the multiplier is one for each metric, so if performance is ‘at target’ against each metric, the result 
is a ‘target’ bonus outcome. To achieve the maximum payout, performance against all three metrics must be at or above the 
stretch level. Profit performance is the most important of the three metrics, so multipliers for the profitability factor are more 
heavily geared than for the other two metrics, that is, improvements in profitability have a significantly greater impact on bonus 
payments. All multipliers and their weightings are agreed by the Committee when targets are set at the start of the year, reflecting 
the importance of each of the metrics in the context of the progress made against the Group’s long-term business strategy.
The maximum bonus opportunity is 175%. Above a certain level of performance, the bonus calculation for the Chief Executive is 
made on the basis that the bonus ‘target’ is 50% (rather than 75%) of salary.
Malus/claw back provisions
Both the cash and share elements are subject to malus and claw back provisions for a period of 24 months following the award. 
This means that they may be recouped in whole or in part, at the discretion of the Committee, in the exceptional event that results 
were found to have been misstated or if an executive director commits an act of gross misconduct.
Deferral into shares
The bonus amount up to 100% of base salary is paid in cash. The excess above 100% of base salary is paid in the form of deferred 
shares. The shares are released after two years subject to the executive director remaining in service with the Group, and carry 
the right to receive a payment in lieu of dividend between award and release. Both the cash and share elements are subject to 
malus and claw back provisions, as set out above.
Arrangements for the coming year
This overall framework will be retained for the year ahead, with a change to the top-line ‘growth’ metric. The Committee has 
agreed that targets for the year ahead will be set against an SFI volume growth metric, which is a key driver of our long-term 
business strategy and 2020 Ambition. The selection of an SFI volume metric is consistent with our reported KPIs, and does not 
suffer from the impact of fluctuating corn price in the way that an equivalent sales metric would. We understand shareholders 
regard this metric as a key indicator of progress against our strategy, and we believe this metric will place greater focus on the 
necessary actions to grow the SFI business consistent with our business strategy. The overall bonus framework will continue to 
give the greatest weighting to the Group profit metric, and retains the requirement that a minimum level of profit must be 
achieved before any bonus is payable regardless of performance against other metrics.
The Board considers that bonus targets for the year ahead are commercially sensitive because they may reveal information about 
the business plan in the year ahead that may damage our competitive advantage, and accordingly does not disclose these on a 
prospective basis. However, we continue our practice of reporting targets in full, and the level of performance actually achieved, 
for the year just ended.

In determining final bonus awards, the Committee also considers the Group’s overall operational and financial performance to 
ensure the results are consistent with the Group’s underlying strength and performance. Having taken the Group’s safety 
performance into account, the Committee exercised its discretion to reduce the level of bonus payable to executive directors and 
other members of the Executive Committee. For the Chief Executive, this reduction was 20% and for the Chief Financial Officer 
this reduction was 10%. Accordingly, the Committee has approved awards of 140% of salary for the Chief Executive and 158% of 
salary for the Chief Financial Officer.

90 Tate & Lyle PLC Annual Report 2017 Long-term incentive – Performance Share Plan (PSP)
Overview
The PSP provides a share-based incentive to closely align executive directors’ and senior executives’ interests with the strategy 
and with the interests of shareholders over the long term. It is therefore an important component of the overall package. 
Maximum award level
Since the 2010 AGM, awards to executive directors and other senior executives have been granted at the discretion of the 
Committee, with flexibility for the Committee to make awards of up to 300% of base salary where necessary to ensure market 
competitiveness, while taking into account Group performance. Individual awards made in any year are considered by the 
Committee on a case-by-case basis. 
Performance conditions for awards to 2015
The release of awards depends on the Group’s performance during the three-year performance period beginning on 1 April in the 
year of the award. For awards made in the years 2010 to 2015 (inclusive), the performance conditions comprised two elements, 
explained in the table below. These metrics were selected following the review and consultation with shareholders at that time, as 
they represented key drivers of shareholder value creation for the Group as a whole.

1 The ROCE outcome may be adjusted downward in the event of an asset impairment (adding this back into capital employed); this is to encourage a prudent investment 
strategy. In these circumstances, the ROCE figure for PSP purposes can be significantly lower than would otherwise be reported.
2 ROCE performance for awards made in 2013, 2014, and 2015 is assessed on the basis of proportionate consolidation of joint ventures, consistent with the basis on which 
targets were set for these awards prior to their grant. 
Before any shares are released, the Committee must also be satisfied that the level of vesting determined by performance against 
these targets is justified by the broader underlying financial performance of the Group.
2014 PSP awards vesting by reference to the period ended 31 March 2017 (audited)
PSP awards made in 2014 were dependent on EPS growth and ROCE targets as described above, with each condition applicable to 
half of the award. Performance against these conditions and the vesting outcome is indicated in the table below.
Performance 
condition Weighting Performance outcome
Vesting outcome

EPS growth 50% -5.4% nil (below threshold) Based on the combination of EPS

(above stretch) 
1 ROCE performance is shown under proportionate accounting consistent with the basis on which the targets for the 2014 award were established.
The performance period applicable to 2014 awards is 1 April 2014 to 31 March 2017. Over this period, earnings per share did not 
meet threshold, and accordingly the 50% of the award which relates to that performance metric will lapse. Over the same period, 
the business has maintained clear principles in relation to the disciplined use of capital, and ROCE performance of 16.0% (under 
proportionate accounting) will result in 50% of the total award being permitted to vest.
In confirming the vesting outcome, the Committee also considered the broader underlying financial performance of the Group 
over the performance period, including the impact of impairments, to ensure that vesting results based on these performance 
outcomes are consistent with a broader view of the financial health and performance of the business.

Performance conditions for awards from 2016
In summary, the metrics and targets for awards made from 2016 are:
• ROCE performance applies to half of the award, as we continue to believe very strongly in the efficient deployment of 
Group capital.
• The other half of the award is focused on profit growth: to best reflect our business mix and growth priorities, half of this 
element relates to growth in Group adjusted profit before tax, while half relates to growth in SFI adjusted operating profit 
excluding SPLENDA
® 
Sucralose.
Appropriate threshold and stretch targets for each of these metrics were considered carefully by the Committee taking into 
account a number of reference points, as indicated below. Overall, performance at these levels requires both our Speciality Food 
Ingredients (SFI) and Bulk Ingredients (BI) businesses to perform strongly in their respective markets. SFI should grow modestly 
ahead of the global market (which is expected to grow at c. 4-5%), and the BI business should be managed for steady earnings 
against a US bulk sweeteners market that is in long-term structural decline (see pages 16 and 17 for more details in Marketplace).

underpin
Before any shares are released, the Committee must also be satisfied that the level of vesting determined by 
performance against these targets is justified by the broader underlying financial performance of the Group.
Targets are set and performance is assessed at reported exchange rates. 
The Committee reviews the appropriateness of metrics and targets ahead of the grant of awards in any year to ensure they remain 
sufficiently stretching. 
The level of vesting at threshold is limited to 15% of the maximum for executive directors.
2016 PSP framework aligns with the long-term Group strategy
The performance framework for awards made from 2016 was carefully developed to reflect the strategy and 2020 Ambition. 
The metrics detailed below align the PSP with our strategic priorities to deliver long-term value by:
• Incentivising overall growth in the value of the Group.
• Focusing on above-market growth in our higher value SFI business.
• Incentivising the maintenance of a strong balance sheet.
With this approach, the Committee remains confident that PSP awards remain appropriately aligned with the strategy and 
priorities of the business, and our long-term outlook as expressed in the 2020 Ambition.
We consulted with a broad group of our largest shareholders on these proposals, and note that the proposals met with high 
levels of support during that consultation, and were strongly endorsed by shareholders at the 2016 AGM.
See pages 74 and 75 of our 2016 Annual Report for more details.
92 Tate & Lyle PLC Annual Report 2017 Post-vesting holding period and dividend underpin
• A post-vesting holding period. Executive directors will be required to hold shares for a two-year period after the end of the 
three-year performance period (i.e. the combination of performance and holding period will be five years in total). This holding 
period will sit alongside the existing personal shareholding requirements and claw back/malus provisions, and demonstrates a 
strong long-term alignment with shareholder interests.
• A dividend underpin supplements the existing financial performance underpin. The Committee retains a specific additional 
discretion to reduce PSP vesting for the performance period, regardless of the level of achievement against the applicable 
performance conditions, if dividends paid by the Group over the performance period do not conform to the stated dividend policy. 
We have made a commitment to a progressive dividend policy, where we aim to grow the dividend over time taking into account 
the earnings prospects of the business. This approach recognises the importance of the dividend to investors, and underlines 
the Group’s commitment to the stated dividend policy.
Malus and claw back provisions
Awards made under the PSP from 1 April 2013 are subject to malus and claw back provisions for a period following the vesting 
date and extending to the fifth anniversary following the date of grant. During this period, the Committee may determine that an 
award will lapse wholly or in part (or may require that a participant shall repay up to 100% of the value of any award that has 
vested by virtue of performance), in the event of circumstances including the following: material misstatement of financial results; 
misconduct which justifies, or could justify, summary dismissal of the participant; or if information emerges which would have 
affected the value of the original award that was granted to a participant, or the level at which the performance conditions were 
judged to have been satisfied.

1 Benefits for executive directors include health insurance and car allowance. As stated last year, the cash value of the healthcare benefit provided to the Chief Executive has 
increased to reflect the cost of provision of international healthcare benefits since the position was originally established on appointment in 2009 (driven by periodic 
premium renewals and the rates based on age and medical inflation trends over time).
2 In accordance with the Group’s expenses policies, non-executive directors receive reimbursement for their reasonable expenses for attending Board meetings. In instances 
where those costs are treated by HMRC as taxable benefits, the Group also meets the associated tax cost to the non-executive director through a PAYE settlement 
agreement with HMRC. Amounts are minimal and do not show in the table after rounding. 
3 Bonus includes the value of deferred shares. The cash bonus award to Javed Ahmed was £721,000 and the cash bonus award to Nick Hampton was £512,750.
4 This is the PSP Award made in 2014. PSP awards outcomes are discussed on page 91.
5 This relates to compensatory share awards made in connection with Mr Hampton’s employment. Further details are provided on page 96.
6 Year-on-year changes reflect changes in Committee chairmanship and Senior Independent Director responsibilities (see page 13). Dr Gerry Murphy, Lars Frederiksen, 
Jeanne Johns and Sybella Stanley joined the Board during the year; Virginia Kamsky stepped down as a Director on 1 July 2015.

1 Deferred shares are granted under the annual bonus plan (as described on page 89). The full value of these awards has been previously disclosed for each Director in the 
‘single figure’ table in last year’s Annual Report for the year ended 31 March 2016. The share allocation is made during the year ending 31 March 2017, and shown in the 
table above, based on the average share price over the last three months of the preceding financial year, being 578.15 pence per share for the 2016 award. 
2 Deferred bonus awards were subject to performance conditions in the year ending 31 March 2016, and remain subject to continued employment.
3 Under the terms of the plan approved by shareholders, the number of shares comprising an award in any year is calculated based on the average share price over the last 
three months of the preceding financial year, being 578.15 pence per share for the 2016 award. During the year, the Committee approved awards of 300% of salary for the 
Chief Executive and 300% of salary for the Chief Financial Officer, which is within our approved Remuneration Policy.

Savings-related share options are options granted under the HMRC-approved Sharesave Plan. Options are granted on the same 
terms to all participating employees, are not subject to performance conditions, and are normally exercisable during the six-
month period following the end of the relevant three- or five-year savings contract. The exercise price reflects a 20% discount to 
market value as permitted under HMRC rules, and is applicable to all participants.

1 This award, to compensate Javed Ahmed for certain long-term incentives given up by him as a consequence of leaving his former employer, was not subject to 
performance conditions. The shares were available to exercise from 1 October 2011, being the second anniversary of Javed Ahmed joining the Group, and will remain 
exercisable until 30 September 2017. Pending delivery, he receives a payment in lieu of dividend on these shares which is subject to the deduction of tax. In the event of a 
change in control, the shares would be delivered immediately.
2 The three-year performance period for these awards began on the first day of the financial year in which the award was granted.
3 The performance conditions for PSP awards made in 2013, 2014 and 2015 are 50% adjusted diluted EPS and 50% adjusted ROCE, as described in this Report.
4 The PSP award made in 2014 will vest at 50%, following the Committee’s assessment of performance conditions (as described on page 91).
5 These awards were made in connection with Nick Hampton’s employment, to compensate him for incentives forfeited with his previous employer, as described in the 2014 
and 2015 Directors’ Remuneration Reports (which were subject to advisory shareholder votes at the 2014 and 2015 AGMs):
• 2014 Restricted Share Award (RSA): As described on pages 71 and 76 of the 2015 Annual Report, the 2014 RSA may vest in two equal tranches on the first and 
second anniversary of appointment, subject to employment and specified performance conditions. The Committee approved the vesting of the first tranche of the 
award on 1 September 2015, as described on page 78 of the 2016 Annual Report. The Committee approved the vesting of the second tranche of the award, in full, on 
1 September 2016, being the second anniversary of appointment, taking into account Nick Hampton’s specific strategic and operational contributions to the 
business, including:
• Establishing a Business Performance Management function and leading global procurement initiatives to deliver material financial benefits reflected in Group 
financial performance through FY16, in the context of very significant commodities weakness (adverse £29m, as reported with our financial results for the period 
ending 31 March 2016), as well as demonstrable improvements in working capital and cash flow performance over the same period. 
• Leadership of a robust long-term financial planning exercise linked to our stated 2020 Ambition and associated Capital Markets event in January 2016. 
Implementation of a revised approach to better link the longer-term commercial and capital expenditure plans through to annual operating planning objectives 
and execution plans. These processes are underpinned by strengthened sales forecasting and operational (supply chain and demand planning) processes to 
enable the business to deliver more stable financial performance compared with when Nick joined the business, and to enable the Group to better respond to 
market challenges and unforeseen risks during the year. 
• Strong overall stewardship of the major change projects executed during FY16 (Eaststarch business realignment and consolidation of Sucralose manufacturing), 
with the final outcomes delivered to the planned time-horizons and with exceptional cash costs lower than planned.
• Leading the improvements in our communications with the market, including the development of the enhanced disclosure framework, a refreshed equity story 
and clear articulation of the 2020 Ambition with our half-year results in November 2015, and the Capital Markets event in January 2016, that received positive 
investor feedback.
• 2015 Restricted Share Award (RSA): as described on page 71 of the 2015 Annual Report, this award was made to compensate Mr Hampton for incentives forfeited 
with his previous employer and will vest, based on continued employment and satisfactory personal performance, following the announcement of results for the 
year ending 31 March 2017.
96 Tate & Lyle PLC Annual Report 2017 Personal share ownership requirements (policy on executive share ownership)
The Committee and executive management believe that personal investment in Company shares is an important part of our 
overall remuneration framework. Material personal investment in Company shares serves to strengthen the long-term alignment 
of interests between senior executives and shareholders.
Our executive shareholding requirements are more demanding and extend to a greater number of senior executives in the Group 
when compared with similar UK-listed companies.
• The Chief Executive has a target share ownership requirement of four times base salary. At 31 March 2017, he holds shares in 
accordance with this policy with a value in excess of 30 times base salary. 
• The Chief Financial Officer has a target shareholding of three times base salary, to be achieved within five years of appointment. 
Nick Hampton joined the Group in September 2014, and therefore has until September 2019 to meet this target. At 31 March 
2017, he holds shares in accordance with the policy with a value of just under two times base salary. 
• Other Executive Committee members are subject to the share ownership policy, with target holdings at three times salary.
• This policy extends to a broader group of executives who have senior leadership roles within the Group. The shareholding target 
for this group is equal to their base salary.
Under the shareholding policy, the value of shareholdings is assessed net of tax, at the prevailing share price, and executives are 
expected to reach the required level of shareholding within five years of appointment. The Committee monitors progress against 
the share ownership requirements annually.

The Directors are responsible for 
preparing the Annual Report, the 
Directors’ Remuneration Report and the 
Financial Statements in accordance with 
applicable law and regulation.
Company law requires the Directors to 
prepare financial statements for each 
financial year. Under that law the 
Directors have prepared the Group 
Financial Statements in accordance with 
International Financial Reporting 
Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the EU, 
and Company Financial Statements in 
accordance with UK GAAP (United 
Kingdom Accounting Standards, 
comprising FRS 101 ‘Reduced Disclosure 
Framework’ and applicable law). Under 
company law the Directors must not 
approve the financial statements unless 
they are satisfied that they give a true and 
fair view of the state of affairs of the 
Company and the Group and of the profit 
or loss of the Group for that period.
In preparing these financial statements, 
the Directors are required to:
• Select suitable accounting policies and 
then apply them consistently
• Make judgements and accounting 
estimates that are reasonable 
and prudent 
• State whether applicable IFRSs as 
adopted by the EU have been followed 
for the Group Financial Statements 
and United Kingdom Accounting 
Standards, comprising FRS 101, have 
been followed for the Company 
Financial Statements, subject to any 
material departures disclosed and 
explained in the Financial Statements
• Prepare the Financial Statements on 
the going concern basis unless it is 
inappropriate to presume that the 
Company will continue in business.
The Directors are responsible for 
keeping adequate accounting records 
that are sufficient to show and explain 
the Group and Company’s transactions 
and disclose with reasonable accuracy at 
any time the financial position of the 
Company and the Group. These records 
should enable them to ensure that the 
financial statements and the Directors’ 
Remuneration Report comply with the 
Companies Act 2006 and, as regards the 
Group Financial Statements, Article 4 of 
the IAS Regulation. The Directors are 
also responsible for safeguarding the 
assets of the Company and the Group 
and hence for taking reasonable steps 
for the prevention and detection of fraud 
and other irregularities.
The Directors are responsible for the 
maintenance and integrity of the 
Company’s website. Legislation in the 
UK governing the preparation and 
dissemination of financial statements 
may differ from legislation in 
other jurisdictions.
Each of the Directors, whose names and 
functions are listed on pages 52 to 55, 
confirm that, to the best of his or 
her knowledge:
• The Annual Report, taken as a whole, is 
fair, balanced and understandable and 
provides the information necessary for 
shareholders to assess the Company’s 
and the Group’s position and 
performance, business model 
and strategy
• The Group Financial Statements, 
which have been prepared in 
accordance with IFRSs as adopted by 
the EU, give a true and fair view of the 
assets, liabilities, financial position 
and profit of the Group
• The Company Financial Statements, 
which have been prepared in 
accordance with UK GAAP (United 
Kingdom Accounting Standards, 
comprising FRS 101 ‘Reduced 
Disclosure Framework’ and applicable 
law) give a true and fair view of the 
assets, liabilities, financial position and 
profit of the Company
• The Strategic Report and the 
Directors’ Report include a fair review 
of the development and performance 
of the business and the position of the 
Group and the Company, together with 
a description of the principal risks and 
uncertainties that it faces.
Disclosure of information to 
auditors
So far as each Director is aware, there is 
no relevant audit information of which the 
Company’s auditors are unaware; and he 
or she has taken all the steps that he or 
she ought to have taken as a Director in 
order to make himself or herself aware of 
any relevant audit information and to 
establish that the Group and Company’s 
auditors are aware of that information.
The Directors’ Report on pages 52 to 73, 
pages 98 and 99 and pages 187 to the 
inside back cover and the Directors’ 
Remuneration Report from pages 74 to 
97 of this Annual Report were approved 
by the Directors on 24 May 2017.

100 Tate & Lyle PLC Annual Report 2017 
Report on the Group financial statements 
Our opinion 
In our opinion, Tate & Lyle PLC’s Group financial statements 
(the ‘financial statements’): 
• give a true and fair view of the state of the Group’s affairs as  
at 31 March 2017 and of its profit and cash flows for the year 
then ended; 
• have been properly prepared in accordance with International 
Financial Reporting Standards (‘IFRSs’) as adopted by the 
European Union; and 
• have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of 
the Companies Act 2006 and Article 4 of the IAS Regulation. 
What we have audited 
The Group financial statements comprise: 
• the consolidated statement of financial position at 31 March 
2017; 
• the consolidated income statement and consolidated 
statement of comprehensive income for the year then ended; 
• the consolidated statement of cash flows for the year then 
ended; 
• the consolidated statement of changes in equity for the year 
then ended; and 
• the notes to the consolidated financial statements, which 
include a summary of significant accounting policies and 
other explanatory information. 
Certain required disclosures have been presented elsewhere  
in the Annual Report, rather than in the notes to the financial 
statements. These are cross-referenced from the financial 
statements and are identified as audited. 
The financial reporting framework that has been applied in  
the preparation of the Group financial statements is IFRSs  
as adopted by the European Union and applicable law. 
Our audit approach 
Context 
The context of our audit was set by the Group’s major activities 
in the year ended 31 March 2017 (‘FY17’). FY17 was the first year 
since the Group’s re-alignment of the Eaststarch joint venture in 
Europe and the restructuring of activities in Singapore. 
Consequently these are no longer included as specific areas of 
focus for FY17. By comparison, FY17 involved fewer significant 
business changes, although the Group sold its interest in 
Howbetter, China and restructured its Food Systems blending 
sites in Europe. 
The goodwill associated with Gemacom, the Group’s Food 
Systems business in Brazil was previously identified by 
management as sensitive to reasonably possible changes in 
assumptions. Subsequently management has recorded an 
impairment of £16 million in FY 17. Goodwill and intangible asset 
impairment has been added as an area of focus given 
management judgement is exercised in this area.  
Our other areas of focus have been further refined to reflect 
certain developments in the Group during FY17.
 
Materiality
Overall Group materiality: £12 million, which represents approximately 5% of profit before 
tax from continuing operations adding back the Group’s share of tax of joint ventures and 
associates and exceptional items, which is our defined profit measure.  
Audit scope 
Our audit included full-scope audits of six reporting components (Tate & Lyle PLC, 
Tate & Lyle International Finance, the US Bu lk Ingredients business, the US Speciality 
Food Ingredients business, the US Sucralose business and G.C. Hahn and Company 
Limited in Wales) with specified audit procedures performed at a further three reporting 
components (Tate & Lyle Services Slovakia, T& L Insurance Gibraltar and the US Tax Group). 
Taken together, the components at which audit work was performed accounted for 82%  
of consolidated sales and 63% of our profit measure (as defined above). This percentage  
is calculated on an absolute basis, which aggregates component profits and losses, 
ignoring sign convention.  
Our audit covered all components that individually contributed more than 10% of 
consolidated sales and of our profit measure (as defined above).  
Areas of focus 
• Commodity risk; 
• Complex tax accounting and uncertain tax positions; 
• Retirement benefit obligations and assets; and 
• Goodwill and intangible asset impairment.

The scope of our audit and our areas of focus 
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland) (‘ISAs (UK & Ireland)’). 
We designed our audit by determining materiality and assessing the risks of material misstatement in the financial statements. In 
particular, we looked at where the Directors made subjective ju dgements, for example in respect of significant accounting estim ates 
that involved making assumptions and considering future events th at are inherently uncertain. As in all of our audits we also 
addressed the risk of management override of internal controls, including evaluating whether there was evidence of bias by the 
Directors that represented a risk of material misstatement due to fraud.  
The risks of material misstatement that had the greatest effect on our audit, including the allocation of our resources and eff ort, are 
identified as ‘areas of focus’ in the table below. We have also set out how we tailored our audit to address these specific are as in 
order to provide an opinion on the financial statements as a whole, and any comments we make on the results of our procedures 
should be read in this context. This is not a complete list of all risks identified by our audit. 
Area of focus How our audit addressed the area of focus 
Commodity risk 
Refer to Notes 2, 28 and 29. 
The Group’s accounting policy is to mark-to-market at each 
balance sheet date its commodity positions, including its forward 
sales and purchase contracts with customers and grain 
suppliers. In addition, certain commodity raw material 
inventories are measured at net realisable value. The Group 
manages the commodity price risk on sales and purchase 
contracts by taking long and short positions and through the use 
of derivative financial instruments. 
This was an area of focus due to the complexity of the 
calculations and the judgement involved in the valuation of 
certain commodities positions, most notably co-products that do 
not have an actively traded futures market. These co-products 
include corn gluten feed, corn gluten meal and corn oil. 
Additionally, basis adjustments are made to certain commodity 
valuations to reflect market conditions, which necessitate 
further management judgement. 
The fair values of commodities pricing contracts as at 31 March 
2017 were assets of £29 million and liabilities of £16 million. 
We understood and evaluated management’s process for 
managing the commodity price risk inherent within its 
commodity positions and compared it with management’s 
underlying risk management and accounting policies. No 
matters were identified that would indicate that the risk 
management and accounting policies were not being followed.  
We obtained management’s forward pricing sheet for 
commodities used in its mark-to-market calculations. For 
those commodities with an actively traded market, we assessed 
the consistency of the forward prices with those published by 
the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. For those commodities 
where an active futures market does not exist (principally  
co-products) and for the basis adjustments made, we 
understood and challenged management’s methodology  
for determining the valuations, including the inputs and 
assumptions used. To further assess the reasonableness of  
the forward prices estimated by management, we performed 
trend analyses against similar market or exchange traded 
commodities and compared certain ratios of co-product prices 
against historical ratios.  
In addition to testing the forw ard price estimates, we audited 
the calculations of the fair value and associated unrealised 
gains and losses on the commodity based positions. We found 
that management’s forward price estimates and the 
calculations of fair value of positions were reasonable and 
supported by market observable data, where appropriate. 
Where management had calculated values by reference to  
non-market observable data, we found that these were within 
acceptable ranges.  
For derivative financial instruments, which were used to 
manage the commodity price risk, we independently confirmed 
these positions with the counterparty and recalculated the fair 
value of the positions held. We found that the fair values of 
these derivative financial instruments were supported by the 
confirmations and recalculations.

Area of focus How our audit addressed the area of focus 
Complex tax accounting and uncertain tax positions 
Refer to Notes 2 and 12. 
The nature of the Group’s multinational and cross-border 
operations exposes it to complicated tax regulations. This 
requires management to exercise judgement in determining the 
appropriate amount of tax to prov ide in respect of tax obligations 
in a number of jurisdictions. In addition, certain financing 
arrangements that the Group has entered into, while not 
uncommon or unduly aggressive, have been previously subject 
to enquiry by tax authorities. The result of enquiries by tax 
authorities could materially affect the quantum of tax provisions 
recognised in the Group financial statements. At 31 March 2017 
Tate & Lyle had centrally held provisions for uncertain tax 
positions of £34 million (2016 – £31 million). 
Additionally, the Group has executed transactions during FY17 
for which the accounting and current and deferred tax 
considerations required substantial analysis. These transactions 
have given rise to exceptional deferred tax assets of £65 million. 
In conjunction with our UK, US and international tax and transfer 
pricing specialists, we evaluate d and challenged management’s 
judgements in respect of esti mates of tax exposures and 
contingencies, in order to assess the adequacy of the Group’s tax 
provisions. This included obtainin g a detailed understanding of the 
Group’s key technical tax matters and risks related to business and 
legislative developments.  
We recalculated management’s valu ation of its tax provisions and 
determined whether the calculations were in line with the Group’s 
methodology and principl es, and whether they had been applied on 
a basis consistent with previous years. We also examined 
management’s ongoing analysis of its financing arrangements and 
considered recent correspondence with the tax authorities. 
From the evidence obtained, we concluded that the level of 
provisioning was acceptable. 
Additionally, we assessed the a ppropriateness of judgements and 
estimates, as they pertain to taxation in transactions executed 
during FY17 and concluded they were appropriate. 
The valuation of the exceptional de ferred tax assets of £65 million 
was judgemental and we assessed the key assumpt ions made by 
the Group and concluded they were appropriate. In respect of the 
deferred tax asset of £34 million relating to previously 
unrecognised tax losses, we also confirmed its recoverability as 
reasonable against expected future taxable profit. 
Retirement benefit obligations and assets 
Refer to Notes 2 and 30. 
The Group has significant retirement benefit obligations in the 
UK and the US, including unfunded retirement medical plans in 
the US. At 31 March 2017 the present value of these obligations 
was £1,769 million (2016 – £1,634 mi llion) offset by plan assets at 
fair value of £1,630 million (2016 – £1,426 million) in respect of 
funded schemes. 
These retirement benefit obligations were determined based on 
a number of actuarial assumptions and calculations, which were 
subject to significant judgement and estimate. Changes in these 
assumptions can have a material impact on the quantum of 
obligations recorded in the cons olidated statement of financial 
position. 
During FY17, a triennial valuation was completed on the main  
UK scheme and a gain was recorded in the US following a  
lump-sum settlement in the year. 
 
We understood and evaluated the assumptions used by the 
Group’s actuaries and management in calculating the 
retirement benefit obligations for the defined benefit pension 
plans in the UK and the US and the unfunded retirement 
medical scheme in the US.  
In conjunction with our pensions specialists we challenged the 
actuarial assumptions by comparing these against benchmark 
ranges based on the market conditions and expectations at  
31 March 2017. Based on our review of the assumptions,  
in each case we found that the actuarial assumptions used 
were reasonable and sat within our acceptable range and, 
where appropriate, were applied on a basis consistent with 
previous years.  
In addition, we independently confirmed the pension assets 
held by the UK and US schemes with the third-party custodians 
and fund managers. We also performed an independent 
assessment of the asset valuations and concluded that they 
were appropriate. 
Goodwill and intangible asset impairment 
Refer to Notes 2 and 19. 
At 31 March 2017 the Group has a net balance of £212 million of 
goodwill (2016 – £204 million). In addition, the Group has £189 
million of intangible assets (2016 – £186 million) comprising 
patents and other intellectual property, capitalised development 
expenses and other acquired intangible assets.  
The carrying values of goodwill and intangible assets are contingent 
on future cash flows and there is a risk that the assets will be 
impaired if these cash flows do not meet the Group’s expectations. 
The impairment reviews perfor med by the Group contained a 
number of judgements and estimate s including revenue growth,  
the success of market and capacity expansion, profit margin, cash 
conversion, terminal values and discount rates. Changes in these 
assumptions could lead to an impairment to the carrying value of 
intangible assets and goodwill. 
During the year, the Group recogn ised a £16 million impairment 
charge against the carrying value of goodwill relating to the 
Gemacom business in Brazil, £2 million against the goodwill relating 
to Howbetter in China and £5 million in respect of other intangibles.  
We obtained the Group’s annual impairment analyses and 
tested the reasonableness of key assumptions, including profit 
and cash flow growth or decline, terminal values and the 
selection of discount rates. We assessed the appropriateness of 
the discount rate and challenged management’s other key 
assumptions, including comparing relevant assumptions with 
industry and economic forecasts.  
We obtained and evaluated management’s sensitivity analyses 
to ascertain the impact of reasonably possible changes in key 
assumptions and we performed our own independent 
sensitivity calculations to quantify the downside changes to 
management’s models required to result in impairment.  
With the exception of Biovelop, there is no reasonably possible 
change in one or more of the key assumptions used in the 
impairment tests for goodwill and other intangible assets that 
would give rise to an impairment loss during the coming year. 
As a result of our work, we determined that the impairment 
charges recognised during the year were appropriate.

How we tailored the audit scope 
We tailored the scope of our audit to ensure that we performed enough work to be able to give an opinion on the financial 
statements as a whole, taking into account the geographic structure of the Group, the accounting processes and controls, and th e 
industry in which the Group operates.  
The Group is structured across two divisions: Speciality Food Ingredients and Bulk Ingredients, with a central support function.  
The Group financial statements are a consolidation of the Group’s reporting units, spread across the two divisions, which compr ise 
the Group’s operating businesses and centralised functions of more than 250 individual components. 
In establishing the overall approach to the Group audit, we determined the type of work that needed to be performed at the repo rting 
units by us, as the Group engagement team, or component auditors from PwC UK or other PwC network firms operating under our 
instruction. Where the work was performed by component auditors, we determined the level of involvement we needed to have in 
the audit work at those components, in order to be able to co nclude whether sufficient appropriate audit evidence had been 
obtained, as a basis for our opinion on the Group financial statements as a whole. This involvement included oversight visits, 
meetings with management and review of working papers at the Group’s two significant components in the US and at the Global 
Shared Services centre in Poland. We also attended the clearance meetings for these components. In addition, we met with 
management in Slovakia and Wales, and the non-PwC firm audit team for the Group’s joint venture in Mexico, and instructed  
PwC Mexico to review the working papers in respect of the audit work they performed.  
Materiality 
The scope of our audit was influenced by our application of materiality. We set certain quantitative thresholds for materiality . These, 
together with qualitative considerations, helped us to determin e the scope of our audit and the nature, timing and extent of our audit 
procedures on the individual financial statement line items and disclosures and in evaluating the effect of misstatements, both 
individually and on the financial statements as a whole.  
Based on our professional judgement, we determined materi ality for the financial statements as a whole as follows: 
Overall Group materiality £12 million (2016 – £10 million). 
How we determined it Approximately 5% of profit before tax from continuing 
operations (£233 million) adding back the Group’s share of tax 
of joint ventures and associates (£12 million) and exceptional 
items (£18 million), as defined in Note 3 to the Group financial 
statements. 
Rationale for benchmark applied The Group’s principal measure of earnings is adjusted profit 
before tax from continuing operations, which excludes 
exceptional items, amortisation of acquired intangible assets 
and net retirement benefit interest from profit before tax.  
The Group adjusts for exceptional items as it believes that  
doing so is necessary to provide an understanding of financial 
performance. We have not used the Group’s principal measure, 
as defined above, as our benchmark since the amortisation of 
acquired intangible assets and net retirement benefit interest 
are recurring items.  
We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to them misstatements identified during our audit above £500,000 (2016: 
£500,000) as well as misstatements below that amount that, in our view, warranted reporting for qualitative reasons. 
Going concern 
Under the Listing Rules we are required to review the Directors’ statement, set out on page 99, in relation to going concern. W e have 
nothing to report having performed our review.  
Under ISAs (UK & Ireland) we are required to report to you if we have anything material to add or to draw attention to in relat ion to 
the Directors’ statement about whether they considered it approp riate to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the financi al 
statements. We have nothing material to add or to draw attention to.  
As noted in the Directors’ statement, the Directors have concluded that it is appropriate to adopt the going concern basis in 
preparing the financial statements. The going concern basis presumes that the Group has adequate resources to remain in 
operation, and that the Directors intend it to do so, for at le ast one year from the date the financial statements were signed. As part 
of our audit we have concluded that the Directors’ use of the going concern basis is appropriate. However, because not all futu re 
events or conditions can be predicted, these statements are not a guarantee as to the Group’s ability to continue as a going co ncern.

Consistency of other information and compliance with applicable requirements 
Companies Act 2006 reporting 
In our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of the audit: 
• the information given in the Strategic Report and the Directors’ Report for the financial year for which the financial statemen ts are 
prepared is consistent with the financial statements; and 
• the Strategic Report and the Directors’ Report have been pr epared in accordance with applicable legal requirements. 
In addition, in light of the knowledge and understanding of the Group and its environmen t obtained in the course of the audit, we are 
required to report if we have identified any material misstate ments in the Strategic Report and the Directors’ Report. We have 
nothing to report in this respect. 
ISAs (UK & Ireland) reporting 
Under ISAs (UK & Ireland) we are required to report to you if in our opinion:  
• information in the Annual Report is: 
• materially inconsistent with the information in the audited financial statements; or 
• apparently materially incorrect based on, or materially inconsistent with, our 
knowledge of the Group acquired in the course of performing our audit; or 
otherwise misleading. 
We have no exceptions to report. 
• the statement given by the Directors on page 99, in accordance with provision C.1.1 of 
the UK Corporate Governance Code (the “Code” ), that they consider the Annual Report 
taken as a whole to be fair, balanced and understandable and provides the information 
necessary for members to assess the Group’s position and performance, business 
model and strategy is materially incons istent with our knowledge of the Group 
acquired in the course of performing our audit. 
We have no exceptions to report. 
• the section of the Annual Report on page 66, as required by provision C.3.8 of the Code, 
describing the work of the Audit Committee does not appropriately address matters 
communicated by us to the Audit Committee. 
We have no exceptions to report. 
   
The Directors’ assessment of the prospects of the Group and of the principal risks that would threaten the solvency or 
liquidity of the Group 
Under ISAs (UK & Ireland) we are required to report to you if we have anything material to add or to draw attention to in relation to: 
• the Directors’ confirmation on page 39 of the Annual Report, in accordance with 
provision C.2.1 of the Code, that they have carried out a robust assessment of the 
principal risks facing the Group, including those that would threaten its business 
model, future performance, solvency or liquidity. 
We have nothing material to add or to 
draw attention to. 
• the disclosures in the Annual Report that describe those risks and explain how they 
are being managed or mitigated. 
We have nothing material to add or to 
draw attention to. 
• the Directors’ explanation on page 39 of the Annual Report, in accordance with 
provision C.2.2 of the Code, as to how they have assessed the prospects of the Group, 
over what period they have done so and why they consider that period to be 
appropriate, and their statement as to whether they have a reasonable expectation 
that the Group will be able to continue in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall 
due over the period of their assessment, including any related disclosures drawing 
attention to any necessary qualifications or assumptions. 
We have nothing material to add or to 
draw attention to. 
Under the Listing Rules we are required to review the Directors’ statement that they have carried out a robust assessment of th e 
principal risks facing the Group and the Directors’ statement in relation to the longer-term viability of the Group. Our review was 
substantially less in scope than an audit and only consisted of making inquiries and considering the Directors’ process support ing 
their statements; checking that the statements are in alignment wi th the relevant provisions of the Code; and considering wheth er 
the statements are consistent with the knowledge acquired by us in the course of performing our au dit. We have nothing to repor t 
having performed our review. 
   
Adequacy of information and explanations received 
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you 
if, in our opinion, we have not received all the information and 
explanations we require for our audit. We have no exceptions to 
report arising from this responsibility.

Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you 
if, in our opinion, certain disclosures of Directors’ remuneration 
specified by law are not made. We have no exceptions to report

Responsibilities for the financial statements 
and the audit 
Our responsibilities and those of the Directors 
As explained more fully in the Directors’ Statement of 
Responsibilities set out on page 99, the Directors are 
responsible for the preparation of the financial statements  
and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view. 
Our responsibility is to audit and express an opinion on the 
financial statements in accordance with applicable law and ISAs 
(UK & Ireland). Those standards require us to comply with the 
Auditing Practices Board’s Ethical Standards for Auditors. 
This report, including the opinions, has been prepared for  
and only for the Parent Company’s members as a body in 
accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006 
and for no other purpose. We do not, in giving these opinions, 
accept or assume responsibility for any other purpose or to any 
other person to whom this report is shown or into whose hands 
it may come save where expressl y agreed by our prior consent 
in writing. 
What an audit of financial statements involves 
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and 
disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give 
reasonable assurance that the financial statements are free 
from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. 
This includes an assessment of:  
• whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the 
Group’s circumstances and have been consistently applied 
and adequately disclosed;  
• the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made 
by the Directors; and  
• the overall presentation of the financial statements.  
We primarily focus our work in these areas by assessing the 
Directors’ judgements against available evidence, forming our 
own judgements, and evaluating the disclosures in the financial 
statements. 
We test and examine information, using sampling and other 
auditing techniques, to the extent we consider necessary  
to provide a reasonable basis for us to draw conclusions.  
We obtain audit evidence through testing the effectiveness of 
controls, substantive procedures or a combination of both.  
In addition, we read all the financial and non-financial 
information in the Annual Report to identify any material 
inconsistencies with the audited financial statements and to 
identify any information that is apparently materially incorrect 
based on, or materially inconsistent with, the knowledge 
acquired by us in the course of performing the audit. If we 
become aware of any apparent material misstatements or 
inconsistencies we consider the implications for our report.  
With respect to the Strategic Report and Directors’ Report,  
we consider whether those reports include the disclosures 
required by applicable legal requirements. 
Other matters 
We have reported separately on the Parent Company financial 
statements of Tate & Lyle PLC for the year ended 31 March 2017 
and on the information in the Directors’ Remuneration Report 
that is described as having been audited.

110 Tate & Lyle PLC Annual Report 2017 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 
  www.tateandlyle.com 111 
1. Basis of preparation 
Description of business  
Tate & Lyle PLC (the Company) is a public limited company 
incorporated in the United Kingdom and registered in England.  
The Company’s ordinary shares are listed on the London  
Stock Exchange. 
The Company and its subsidiaries (together ‘the Group’) provide 
ingredients and solutions to the food, beverage and other 
industries. The Group operates from numerous production 
facilities around the world.  
The Group’s continuing operations comprise two operating 
segments: Speciality Food Ingredients (SFI) and Bulk 
Ingredients (BI). Segment information is presented in Note 5.  
Accounting period  
The Group’s annual financial statements are drawn up to  
31 March. These financial statements cover the year ended  
31 March 2017 with comparative financials for the year ended  
31 March 2016.  
Basis of accounting  
The consolidated financial statements on pages 106 to 177  
have been prepared in accordance with International Financial 
Reporting Standards (IFRS) and related interpretations as 
adopted for use in the European Union and those parts of the 
Companies Act 2006 that are applicable to companies reporting 
under IFRS.  
The directors are satisfied that the Group has adequate 
resources to continue to operate for a period not less than 12 
months from the date of approval of the financial statements 
and that there are no material uncertainties around their 
assessment. Accordingly, the directors continue to adopt the 
going concern basis of accounting.  
The Group’s principal accounting policies are set out in Note 2 
and Note 3 and have been consistently applied throughout the 
year.  
Functional and presentation currency  
The consolidated financial statements are presented in pounds 
sterling, which is also the Company’s functional currency. All 
amounts are rounded to the near est million, unless otherwise 
indicated.  
Accounting standards adopted during the year  
In the current year, the Group has adopted, with effect from  
1 April 2016, new or revised accounting standards as set  
out below: 
• IFRS 11 Joint arrangements (Amendments) 
• IAS 16 Property, plant and equipment (Amendments) 
• IAS 38 Intangible assets (Amendments) 
• IAS 27 Separate financial statements (Amendments) 
• IAS 1 Presentation of financial statements (Amendments) 
• Annual Improvements to IFRS – 2012-14 cycles  
The adoption of these amendments has had no material effect 
on the Group’s financial statements. 
 
Use of alternative performance measures  
The Group also presents alternative performance measures, 
including adjusted operating profit, adjusted profit before tax, 
adjusted earnings per share, adjusted operating cash flow and 
adjusted free cash flow, which are used for internal 
performance analysis and incentive compensation 
arrangements for employees. 
These measures are presented because they provide investors 
with valuable additional information about the performance of 
the business. For the years presented, adjusted performance 
measures exclude, where relevant: 
• Exceptional items (excluded as they relate to events which are 
unlikely to recur, are outside the normal course of business 
and therefore merit separate disclosure in order to provide a 
better understanding of the Group's underlying financial 
performance);  
• Amortisation of acquired intangible assets (costs associated 
with amounts recognised through acquisition accounting that 
impact earnings compared to organic investments);  
• Net retirement benefit interest (accounting charges or credits 
which are not linked to the underlying performance of the 
business. The amounts excluded reflect the net interest cost 
of post-retirement benefit plans substantially closed to future 
accrual); and 
• Tax on the above items and tax items that themselves meet 
these definitions. 
Alternative performance measures reported by the Group are 
not defined terms under IFRS and may therefore not be 
comparable with similarly-titled measures reported by other 
companies.  
Reconciliations of the alternative performance measures to the 
most directly comparable IFRS measures are presented in  
Note 4.  
Changes in constant currency 
Where changes in constant currency are presented, they are 
calculated by retranslating current year results at prior year 
exchange rates. This represents a change to the methodology 
applied in previous years, which involved retranslating prior year 
results at current year exchange rates. This change, which has 
not had a material impact, has been made to align with how the 
majority of external stakeholders view constant currency 
performance comparisons. Reconciliations of the movement  
in constant currency have been included in the additional 
information within this document. 
2. Principal accounting policies requiring 
significant judgements and estimates 
In preparing these consolidated financial statements, 
management has made judgements and used estimates and 
assumptions in establishing the reported amounts of assets, 
liabilities, income and expense under the Group’s accounting 
policies. Judgements are based on the best evidence available 
to management. Estimates are based on factors including 
historical experience and expectations of future events, 
corroborated with external information where possible. 
Judgements and estimates and their underlying assumptions 
are reviewed and updated on an ongoing basis, with any 
revisions being recognised prospectively. However, given the 
inherent uncertainty of such estimates, the actual results might 
differ significantly from the anticipated ones.

2. Principal accounting policies requiring 
significant judgements and estimates continued 
The accounting policies and information about the accounting 
estimates and judgements made in applying these accounting 
policies that have the most significant effect on the amounts 
recognised in the consolidated financial statements are set  
out below.  
Fair value measurement  
(this accounting policy applies principally to Available-for-sale 
financial assets; Derivatives and hedge accounting; Financial 
instruments – fair value and risk management; and Retirement 
benefit obligations – see Notes 18, 28, 29, and 30)  
A number of the Group’s accoun ting policies and disclosures 
require the measurement of fair value for either financial or 
non-financial assets and liabilities. Examples of the former 
include loans, interest rate swaps and commodity contracts; 
examples of the latter include intangibles and property, plant 
and equipment acquired in a business combination.  
Fair value is the amount of money, or other consideration, 
expected to be exchanged for an asset or a liability in an arm’s 
length transaction. When measuring fair value, the Group takes 
into account the characteristics of the asset or liability and uses 
observable market data, such as prices quoted on a recognised 
exchange, to the greatest extent possible. Where such data  
is not available, the Group has an established framework in 
place that deals with setting, monitoring and evaluating  
non-observable inputs, including the respective classification  
of the fair value measurements. Such unobservable inputs  
are based on management’s own assessment of market and 
other conditions currently prevailing or expected to prevail.  
Fair value measurements are categorised into three different 
levels based on the degree to which the inputs used to arrive at 
the fair value of the assets and liabilities are observable and the 
significance of the inputs to the fair value measurement in its 
entirety, as follows:  
• Level 1 inputs are quoted prices (unadjusted) in active 
markets for identical assets or liabilities that the entity can 
assess at the measurement date. The prices of equity shares 
or bonds quoted on the London Stock Exchange are examples 
of Level 1 inputs  
• Level 2 inputs are those, other than quoted prices included in 
Level 1, that are observable either directly or indirectly. Most 
interest rate swaps fall in this category as their prices are 
referenced to a published rate curve, but it is not price 
specific to the swap itself 
• Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs. The Group generally 
classifies assets or liabilities as Level 3 when their fair value 
is determined using unobservable inputs that individually, or 
when aggregated with other unobservable inputs, represent 
more than 10% of the fair value of the observable inputs of the 
assets or liabilities. This would include expected future cash 
flows from budgets and forecasts the entity has made. 
Certain elements of the Group’s commodity contract portfolio 
also fall into this category, as their values include significant 
management-derived assumptions.  
For assets and liabilities that are recognised in the financial 
statements at fair value on a recurring basis, the Group 
determines whether transfers have occurred between levels in 
the hierarchy by reassessing categorisation (based on lowest 
level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement as 
a whole) at the end of the reporting period. 
Judgements and estimates  
Corn and co-product inventories held in the US business are 
measured at net realisable value since they are considered to be 
agricultural produce after harvest. The Group uses financial 
instruments (mainly forward contracts) to manage price risk 
within its US business, by hedging the contracted amount of 
corn when either business division (Bulk Ingredients or 
Speciality Food Ingredients) enters into a finished good sales 
contract.  
The elements of the Group’s US net corn position are accounted 
for as follows:  
• Contracts for the physical purchase of corn in respect of 
corresponding committed sales of finished goods are marked 
to market in accordance with IAS 39 with any gains or losses 
recognised in the income statement  
• Contracts for the sale of corn and corn based products are 
marked to market in accordance with IAS 39 with any gains or 
losses recognised in the income statement  
• Corn inventories are measured at net realisable value in 
accordance with IAS 2.3, with any gains or losses recognised 
in the income statement  
• Financial instruments (futures and options) are carried at fair 
value with any gains or losses recognised immediately in the 
income statement.  
Although the Group manages corn price risk by entering into 
offsetting ‘back-to-back’ corn positions, there is still underlying 
price risk on the basis cost that must be paid to get delivery of 
the corn to its plants. This basis is the difference in price 
between that at which a farmer will sell and the price on the 
Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME), and is typically driven by 
local supply, demand and logistic s factors, requiring estimation 
for valuation purposes.  
The production of finished goods from corn also results in the 
production of three co-products (corn gluten feed, corn gluten 
meal and corn oil). The price risk associated with these  
co-products cannot readily be hedged as there are no actively 
traded markets for these commodities. Whilst the Group actively 
manages its overall co-product positions in the US, the Group 
can hold either a net long or short position for each co-product 
based on the volume of co-products made, bought (or short 
sold) and forward sold at any point in time. These positions are 
measured at fair value at each reporting date, with gains and 
losses recognised in the income statement.  
Management exercises significant judgement in deriving these 
fair values, which involves estimating the basis and the price at 
which the Group will purchase or sell these co-product positions 
in the future. These inputs are classified as unobservable, and 
are derived by in-house experts, with reference to sources such 
as: the expected supply and demand for corn and substitute 
products, expectations of weather conditions, and historical 
published co-product pricing levels over a period of up to three 
months from the balance sheet date.  
Whilst it is possible to model the sensitivity of profit to changes 
in any one of the key assumptions, it is important to note that, 
due to the complexity and interdependence of related 
assumptions, the overall (net) impact in reality is likely to  
be different.   
112 Tate & Lyle PLC Annual Report 2017  
  www.tateandlyle.com 113 
The accounting for corn and co-product positions can create 
significant volatility in the Group’s income statement, although 
the use of such contracts is critical to the business as it 
effectively limits the Group’s exposure to fluctuating market 
prices.  
Whilst it is not practical to quantify all elements included in fair 
value measurements, the Group discloses sensitivity analysis on 
the key areas of judgement (price of co-products and basis) and 
the carrying amounts impacted by estimation uncertainty in 
Note 29. Full details of the valuation technique are also included 
in Note 29. 
Taxation  
(this accounting policy principally applies to Income taxes – see 
Note 12)  
Taxable profit differs from accounting profit because it excludes 
certain items of income and expense that are recognised in the 
financial statements but are treated differently for tax purposes.  
Current tax is the amount of tax expected to be payable or 
receivable on the taxable profit or loss for the current period. 
This amount is then amended for any adjustments in respect of 
prior periods. Current tax is calculated using tax rates that have 
been written into law (‘enacted’) or irrevocably 
announced/committed by the respective government 
(‘substantively enacted’) at the period-end date.  
Current tax receivable (assets) and payable (liabilities) are offset 
only when there is a legal right to settle them net and the entity 
intends to do so. This is generally true when the taxes are levied 
by the same tax authority.  
Because of the differences between accounting and taxable 
profits and losses reported in each period, temporary 
differences arise on the amount certain assets and liabilities are 
carried at for accounting purposes and their respective tax 
values. Deferred tax is the amount of tax payable or recoverable 
on these temporary differences.  
Deferred tax liabilities arise where the carrying amount of an 
asset is higher than the tax value (more tax deduction has been 
taken). This can happen where the Group invests in capital 
assets, as governments often encourage investment by allowing 
tax depreciation to be recognised faster than accounting 
depreciation. This reduces the tax value of the asset relative to 
its accounting carrying amount. Deferred tax liabilities are 
generally provided on all taxable temporary differences. The 
periods over which such temporary differences reverse will vary 
depending on the life of the related asset or liability.  
Deferred tax assets arise where the carrying amount of an asset 
is lower than the tax value (less tax benefit has been taken).  
This can happen where the Group has trading losses, which 
cannot be offset in the current period but can be carried 
forward. Deferred tax assets are recognised only where the 
Group considers it probable that it will be able to obtain the 
benefit of them in the future (for example, use such losses by 
offsetting them against future taxable profits).  
Taxable temporary differences can also arise on investments  
in foreign subsidiaries and associates, and interests in joint 
ventures. Where the Group is able to control the reversal of 
these differences and it is probable that these will not reverse in 
the foreseeable future, then no deferred tax is provided.  
Deferred tax is calculated using the enacted or substantively 
enacted rates that are expected to apply when the asset is 
realised or the liability is settled.  
Similarly to current taxes, deferred tax assets and liabilities are 
offset only when there is a legal right to settle them net and the 
entity intends to do so. This normally requires both assets and 
liabilities to have arisen in the same country. 
Income tax expense reported in the financial statements 
comprises current tax as well as the effects of changes in 
deferred tax assets and liabilities. Tax expense/credits are 
generally recognised in the same place as the items to which 
they relate. For example, the tax associated with a gain on 
disposal is recognised in the income statement, in line with the 
gain on disposal. Equally, the tax associated with pension 
obligation actuarial gains and losses is recognised in other 
comprehensive income, in line with the actuarial gains and 
losses.  
Judgements and estimates  
The Group operates in a large number of countries around the 
world. Uncertainties exist in relation to the interpretation of 
complex tax legislation, changes in tax laws, and the amount 
and timing of future taxable income. In some jurisdictions, 
agreeing tax liabilities with loca l tax authorities can take several 
years. This could necessitate future adjustments to taxable 
income and expense already recorded.  
At the period-end date, tax liabilities and assets are based on 
management’s best judgements around the application of the 
tax regulations and management’s estimate of the future 
amounts that will be settled. Management considers tax 
exposures individually, and arrives at judgements with support 
from experienced tax professionals and external advisors. There 
is, however, a risk that the Group’s judgements are challenged 
by the tax authorities, resulting in a different tax payable or 
recoverable from the amounts that have been provided.  
As described in Note 12, the Group has internal funding 
structures that favourably affect the amount of tax payable.  
In management’s view, these structures are compliant with  
the relevant tax regulations.  
Deferred tax assets are recognised for unused tax losses only to 
the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available 
against which the losses can be utilised. Management 
judgement is required to determine the amount of deferred tax 
that should be recognised, dependent on the anticipated timing 
and quantum of future taxable profit.  
The main uncertainties impacting taxation arise from potential 
changes to legislation. Firstly, the OECD’s Base Erosion and 
Profit Shifting (BEPS) project has been one of the most 
significant multilateral initiatives in recent years for modifying 
international tax rules. As these recommendations continue to 
evolve and are adopted into local tax legislation over the coming 
years, this may continue to impact the Group’s effective tax rate. 
Secondly, the UK government has announced changes to UK tax 
legislation in respect of restrictions to interest relief and the use 
of carry forward losses. Whilst this legislation has yet to be 
enacted, these changes may impact our ability to deduct interest 
and fully utilise brought forward losses in the UK in the future. 
Lastly, potential reform of the US tax system could impact  
the Group’s effective tax rate, depending on the nature of any 
such reforms.

2. Principal accounting policies requiring 
significant judgements and estimates continued 
Taxation continued  
Judgements and estimates continued 
The Group’s operating model involves cross-border supply of 
significant volumes of goods into numerous end markets, and 
the provision of services from one jurisdiction to another. There 
is a risk that different tax authorities could seek to assess higher 
profits (or lower costs) to activi ties being undertaken in their 
jurisdiction, potentially leading to higher total tax payable by  
the Group.  
Retirement benefit plans  
(this accounting policy principally applies to Retirement benefit 
obligations – see Note 30)  
The Group operates both defined contribution and defined 
benefit pension plans principally in the UK and the US and 
unfunded retirement medical plans in the US.  
a) Defined benefit plans  
For accounting purposes a valuation of each of the defined 
benefit plans is carried out annually at 31 March using 
independent qualified actuaries. Benefit obligations are 
measured using the projected unit credit method and are 
discounted using the market yields on high-quality corporate 
bonds denominated in the same currency as, and of similar 
duration to, the benefit obligations. Plan assets are measured  
at their fair value at the period-end date. Where a plan holds a 
qualifying insurance policy, the fair value of the policy is deemed 
to be equivalent to the present value of the related benefit 
obligations.  
A deficit or surplus is recognised on each plan, representing the 
difference between the present value of the benefit obligation 
and the fair value of the plan assets. Where a plan is in surplus, 
the surplus recognised is limited to the present value of any 
amounts that the Group expects to recover by way of refunds or 
a reduction in future contributions.  
The costs of the defined benefit plan that are recognised in  
the income statement include the current service cost, any  
past service cost and the interest on the net deficit or surplus. 
Gains or losses on curtailments or settlements of the plans  
are recognised in the income statement in the period in which 
the curtailment or settlement occurs. Plan administration  
costs incurred by the Group are also recognised in the income 
statement.  
Current service cost represents the increase in the present 
value of the benefit obligation due to benefits accrued during  
the period, less employee contributions. Past service cost 
represents the change in the present value of the benefit 
obligation that arises from benefit changes that are applied 
retrospectively to benefits accrued in previous years. Any past 
service cost is recognised in full in the period in which the 
benefit changes are made.  
Interest on the net deficit or surplus is calculated by applying the 
discount rate that is used in measuring the present value of the 
benefit obligation to the deficit or surplus.  
Re-measurements of the deficit or surplus are recognised in 
other comprehensive income. Re-measurements comprise 
differences between the actual return on plan assets (less asset 
management expenses) and the interest on the plan assets and 
actuarial gains and losses. Actuarial gains and losses represent 
the effect of changes in the actuarial assumptions made in 
measuring the present value of the benefit obligation and 
experience differences between those assumptions and actual 
outcomes. Actuarial gains and losses are recognised in full in 
the period in which they occur.  
b) Defined contribution plans  
Contributions made by the Group to defined contribution 
pension schemes are recognised in the income statement in the 
period in which they fall due. 
Judgements and estimates  
At 31 March 2017, the present value of the benefit obligations of 
the plans was £1,769 million (2 016 – £1,634 million), including 
£76 million (2016 – £66 million) in respect of the unfunded 
medical plans. The present value of the benefit obligations is 
based on actuarial estimates of the future benefits that will be 
payable to the members of the plans. As such, the benefit 
obligations are based on a number of assumptions, changes to 
which could have a material impact on the reported amounts.  
The present value of the benefit obligations is most sensitive to 
the discount rate applied to the benefit obligations, assumed life 
expectancies, and expected future price inflation rates. Whilst 
the Group establishes the assumptions on a consistent basis 
reflecting advice from qualified actuaries, based on published 
indices and other actuarial data, management must apply 
judgement in selecting the most appropriate value from within 
an acceptable range.  
Changes in the assumptions used in determining the present 
value of the benefit obligations will have an impact on the 
Group’s income statement through their effect on the service 
cost and the interest on the net de ficit or surplus in the plans. 
However, most of the impact of such changes, together with 
fluctuations in the actual return on the plan assets, will be 
reflected in other comprehensive income.  
Impairment of non-financial assets  
(this accounting policy principally applies to Goodwill and other 
intangibles; and Property, plant and equipment – see Notes 19 
and 20)  
Property, plant and equipment and intangible assets are 
reviewed for impairment whenever any events or changes in 
circumstances indicate that their carrying amounts may not  
be recoverable.  
If such an indication exists, then the recoverable amount of  
the asset is estimated. In addi tion, goodwill is tested for 
impairment annually.  
An asset is impaired to the extent that its carrying amount 
exceeds its recoverable amount. An asset’s recoverable amount 
represents the higher of the benefit which the entity expects to 
derive from the asset over its life, discounted to present value 
(value in use) and the net price for which the entity can sell the 
asset in the open market (fair value less costs of disposal).  
The discount rate used for the value in use calculation is a  
pre-tax rate that reflects the risks specific to the asset or  
groups of assets tested.  
For the purpose of impairment testing, assets are grouped 
together into the smallest group of assets which has cash 
inflows that are largely independent of the cash inflows from 
other assets or groups of assets. This could also be a single 
asset. Goodwill does not generate cash inflows independently 
and is, therefore, tested for impa irment at the level of the Cash 
Generating Unit (‘CGU’) or group of CGUs to which it is allocated. 
Note 19 shows the allocation of ma terial elements of goodwill to 
CGUs for impairment testing purposes.   
114 Tate & Lyle PLC Annual Report 2017  
  www.tateandlyle.com 115 
When goodwill is tested for impairment and the carrying amount 
of the CGU or group of CGUs to which it is allocated exceeds its 
recoverable amount, the impairment is allocated first to reduce 
the carrying amount of the goodwill and then pro-rata to the 
other non-financial assets belonging to the CGU or group of 
CGUs on the basis of their respective carrying amounts.  
Impairment losses are recognised in the income statement. 
Impairment losses recognised in previous periods for assets 
other than goodwill are reversed if there has been a change in 
the estimates used to determine the asset’s recoverable 
amount. Such reversals are limited to the carrying amount of 
the asset had no impairment been recognised in previous 
periods. Impairment losses recognised in respect of goodwill 
cannot be reversed. 
Asset impairments have the potential to significantly impact 
operating profit. In order to determine whether impairments are 
required, the Group estimates the recoverable amount of the 
asset. This calculation is usually based on projecting future cash 
flows over a five-year period and using a terminal value to 
incorporate expectations of growth thereafter. A discount factor 
is applied to obtain a present value (‘value in use’). The ‘fair 
value less costs of disposal’ of an asset may be used where this 
results in an amount in excess of ‘value in use’.  
Judgements and estimates  
Estimated future cash flows for impairment calculations are 
based on management’s expectations of future volumes and 
margins based on plans and best estimates of the productivity  
of the assets in their current condition. Future cash flows 
therefore exclude benefits from major expansion projects 
requiring future capital expenditure where that expenditure  
has not been approved and committed on the dates the assets 
are tested (unless a fair value less costs of disposal model  
is used).  
Future cash flows are discounted using a discount rate 
appropriate for the CGU being tested. The discount rate is 
impacted by estimates of interest rates, equity returns and 
market and country-related risks. The Group’s weighted 
average cost of capital, which is used as the initial reference 
point for the discount rate before any asset specific adjustments 
are made, is reviewed on a regular basis. If the cash flow or 
discount rate assumptions were to change because of market 
conditions, the level of impairment could be different and could 
result in the asset impairment being increased or, excepting 
goodwill, reversed, in part or in full, at a future date.  
Provisions and contingent liabilities  
(see Note 32)  
A provision is a liability of uncertain timing or amount that is 
recognised when: 1) the Group has a present obligation (legal or 
constructive) as a result of a past event; 2) it is more likely than 
not that a payment will be required to settle the obligation; and 
3) the amount can be reliably estimated.  
Where a payment is not probable, or the amount of the 
obligation cannot be measured with sufficient certainty, a 
contingent liability is disclosed.  
Contingent liabilities are also disclosed if a possible obligation 
arises from past events, but its existence will be confirmed only 
by the occurrence or non-occurrence of uncertain future events.  
Provisions are determined by discounting the expected future 
payments using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current 
market assessments of the time value of money and, where 
appropriate, the risks specific to the liability. The unwinding of  
any discount is recognised in the income statement within finance 
expense. The impact of any discounting is not material to the 
Group. 
Provision is made for restructuring costs when a detailed formal 
plan for the restructuring has been determined and the plan  
has been communicated to those affected by it. Gains from  
the expected disposal of assets are not taken into account in 
measuring restructuring provisions. Future operating losses  
are not provided for.  
Provisions are recognised for onerous contracts to the extent  
that the benefits expected to be derived from a contract are  
lower than the unavoidable cost to the Group of meeting its 
obligations under the contract. Before establishing the amount  
of the provision, any impairment losses on assets associated  
with the contract are recognised.  
Judgements and estimates  
The Group is subject to claims and litigation generally arising  
in the ordinary course of its business, some of which are for 
substantial amounts. All such actions are strenuously defended 
but provision is made for liabilities that are considered likely  
to arise on the basis of current information and legal advice and 
after taking into account the Group’s insurance arrangements. 
Whilst there is always uncertainty as to the outcome of any  
claim or litigation, it is not expected that claims and litigation 
existing at 31 March 2017 will have a material adverse effect  
on the Group’s financial position.  
At 31 March 2017, provisions included amounts for insurance 
claims payable by the Group’s reinsurance company, legal  
matters, employee termination and other restructuring costs. 
These have been based on management’s judgement as to  
whether any obligation, legal or otherwise, existed at the balance 
sheet date and if so, management ’s estimate of the likelihood, 
magnitude and timing of future pa yments related to the obligation.  
3. Other principal accounting policies  
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared under 
the historical cost convention, modi fied in respect of the revaluation 
to fair value of available-for-sale financial assets, derivative 
financial instruments, certain inventories, assets classified as  
held for sale, assets held by defined benefit pension plans and 
intangible and tangible assets acquired in a business combination.  
Basis of consolidation  
a) Business combinations  
A business combination is a transaction or other event in which the 
Group obtains control over a busi ness. Business combinations are 
accounted for using the acquisition method, the key elements of 
which are set out below.  
Identifiable assets and liabilities of the acquired business are 
generally measured at their fair value at the acquisition date. 
Retirement benefit obligations and deferred tax assets and liabilities 
are measured in accordance with the Group’s accounting policies.  
Consideration transferred represents the sum of the fair values at  
the acquisition date of the assets gi ven, liabilities incurred or assumed 
and equity instruments issued by the Group in exchange for control 
over the acquired business. Acquisition-related costs are charged to 
the income statement in the peri od in which they are incurred. 
   
STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS USEFUL INFORMATION

116 Tate & Lyle PLC Annual Report 2017 
3. Other principal accounting policies continued 
Basis of consolidation continued 
a) Business combinations continued 
Any non-controlling interest in the acquired business is 
measured either at fair value or at the non-controlling interest’s 
proportionate share of the identifiable assets and liabilities of 
the business.  
Put options written by the Group over non-controlling interests 
are initially recognised as a liability measured at the present 
value of the exercise price with a corresponding charge directly 
to equity. Subsequently, the liability is measured at the present 
value of the expected redemption amount and re-measured in 
accordance with IAS 39 (at amortised cost), with changes 
recognised in the income statement.  
Goodwill arising in a business combination represents the 
excess of the sum of the consideration transferred, the amount 
of any non-controlling interest in the acquired business and, 
where a business combination is achieved in stages, the fair 
value at the acquisition date of the Group’s previously held 
equity interest, over the net total of the identifiable assets and 
liabilities of the acquired business at the acquisition date. Any 
re-measurement gain or loss on the previously held equity 
interest is recognised in the income statement. Any shortfall,  
or negative goodwill, is recognised immediately as a gain in the 
income statement.  
Changes in the Group’s ownership interest in a subsidiary  
that do not result in a loss of control are accounted for within 
equity. Any gain or loss upon loss of control is recognised in the 
income statement.  
b) Subsidiaries  
Subsidiaries are all entities (including structured entities) over 
which the Group has control. The Group controls an entity when 
the Group is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from 
its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those 
returns through its power over the entity. Subsidiaries are 
consolidated from the date on which the Group obtains control. 
They are deconsolidated from the date that control ceases.  
A non-controlling interest in a subsidiary represents the share 
of the net assets of the subsidiary that is attributable to the 
equity interest in the subsidiary that is not owned by the Group.  
The Group’s income and expenses, assets and liabilities and 
cash flows include those of each of its subsidiaries from the 
date on which the Company obtains control until such time as 
control is lost. Inter-company transactions, balances and 
unrealised gains or losses on transactions between Group 
companies are eliminated.  
c) Equity accounted investments  
An associate is an entity over which the Group has significant 
influence. Significant influence is the power to participate in 
financial and operating policy decisions but not to control or 
jointly control them.  
A joint venture is an entity or a contractual arrangement under 
which the Group and other parties undertake activities that are 
subject to joint control, whereby the Group has rights to the net 
assets of the arrangement rather than to the arrangement’s 
assets or obligations for its liabilities.  
Interests in associates and joint ventures (together ‘Equity 
accounted investments’) are accounted for under the equity 
method. They are initially recognised at cost, which includes 
transaction costs. Subsequently, the Group’s share of the profit 
or loss, other comprehensive income and net assets are shown 
on one line of the relevant primary financial statements, until 
the date on which significant influence or joint control ceases.  
Losses of an equity accounted investment in excess of the 
Group’s interest in the entity are not recognised, except to the 
extent that the Group has incurred obligations or made 
payments on behalf of the investment.  
Unrealised profits or losses on transactions between the Group 
and its equity accounted investments are eliminated to the 
extent of the Group’s interest. Losses are, however, recognised 
in full where they represent a reduction in the net realisable 
value of a current asset or an impairment loss. 
Discontinued operations  
(see Note 8)  
An operation is classified as disc ontinued if it is a component  
of the Group that: (i) has been disposed of, or meets the criteria 
to be classified as held for sale; and (ii) represents a separate 
major line of business or geographic area of operations or  
will be disposed of as part of a single co-ordinated plan to 
dispose of a separate major line of business or geographic  
area of operations.  
The results, assets and liabilities and cash flows of discontinued 
operations are presented separately from those of continuing 
operations.  
Discontinued operations comprised the following activities: 
- Eaststarch / Morocco 
On 31 October 2015, the Group completed the re-alignment of 
its Eaststarch joint venture leading to the disposal of the 
majority of the Group’s European Bulk Ingredients business.  
In a related agreement, the Group also agreed to sell its corn 
wet mill in Casablanca, Morocco to Archer Daniels Midland Inc. 
(ADM) and completed this disposal on 1 June 2016.  
- Sugars and European Starch pension settlements 
The Group announced on 29 September 2015, that the 
Commercial Court in London had handed down a decision in a 
case brought by American Sugar Re fining, Inc. (ASR) in which it 
made a number of claims in relation to its acquisition of the 
Group’s European Sugars business in 2010. The European 
Sugars business formed part of the Group’s discontinued 
Sugars segment, and accordingly the costs associated with 
those claims were recognised within discontinued operations. 
During the year ended 31 March 2016, the Group also made a 
settlement payment of £2 million to transfer all remaining 
obligations under a legacy pension scheme related to the 
Group’s discontinued European Wheat Starch business, which 
was disposed of in the 2008 financial year. 
Foreign currency translation  
(this accounting policy applies to all transactions and net assets 
in foreign currencies)  
At entity level, transactions in foreign currencies are translated 
into the entity’s functional currency at the exchange rate ruling 
at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities 
denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the 
exchange rate ruling at the period-end date. Currency 
translation differences arising at entity level are recognised in 
the income statement.  
  
116 Tate & Lyle PLC Annual Report 2017  
  www.tateandlyle.com 117 
The consolidated financial statements are presented in pounds 
sterling. On consolidation, the results of foreign operations are 
translated into pounds sterling at the average rate of exchange 
for the period and their assets and liabilities are translated into 
pounds sterling at the exchange rate ruling at the period-end 
date. Currency translation differences arising on consolidation 
are recognised in other comprehensive income and taken to the 
currency translation reserve.  
Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of 
a foreign operation are treated as assets and liabilities of the 
foreign operation and translated accordingly.  
When a foreign operation is sold, the gain or loss on disposal 
recognised in the income statement is determined after taking 
into account the recycling of cumulative currency translation 
differences arising on consolidation of the operation subsequent 
to the adoption of IFRS.  
In the cash flow statement, the cash flows of foreign operations 
are translated into pounds sterling at the average exchange rate 
for the period.  
Revenue recognition  
(this accounting policy relates to Notes 5 and 6)  
a) Sales of goods and services  
Revenue comprises the fair value of consideration receivable in 
the ordinary course of business, net of value added and sales 
taxes, rebates and discounts and after eliminating sales within 
the Group. Sales are recognised at the point or points at which 
the Group has performed its obligations in connection with the 
contractual terms of the sales agreement, primarily at the point 
of delivering to the customer, and in exchange obtains the right 
to consideration. Discounts mainly comprise volume driven 
rebates. The Group accrues for discounts against agreed 
customer terms reflecting latest expectations of amounts likely 
to fall due under the terms of the customer contract, 
subsequently adjusted for actual performance.  
b) Interest income  
Interest income is recognised on a time proportion basis using 
the effective interest rate method.  
c) Dividend income  
Dividend income is recognised when the right to receive 
payment is established.  
Exceptional items  
(this accounting policy principally relates to Note 7)  
Exceptional items comprise items of income and expense, 
including tax items that are material in amount, relate to events 
which are unlikely to recur, ar e outside the normal course of 
business and therefore merit separate disclosure in order to 
provide a better understanding of the Group's underlying 
financial performance. Examples of events that give rise to the 
disclosure of material items of income and expense as 
exceptional items include, but are not limited to: impairment 
events; significant business transformation activities; disposals 
of operations or significant individual assets; litigation claims by 
or against the Group; and restructuring of components of the 
Group’s operations. 
All material amounts relating to exceptional items in the 
Group’s financial statements are classified on a consistent basis 
across accounting periods. 
 
Goodwill and other intangible assets  
(see Note 19) 
a) Goodwill  
Goodwill arising in a business co mbination is recognised as an 
intangible asset and is allocated to the CGU or group of CGUs 
that is expected to benefit from the synergies of the business 
combination. Goodwill is not amortised but is tested for 
impairment annually.  
Goodwill is carried at cost less any recognised 
impairment losses.  
b) Intangible assets other than goodwill  
Intangible assets other than goodwill are stated at cost less 
accumulated amortisation and any recognised impairment 
losses.  
c) Acquired in business combinations  
An intangible resource acquired in a business combination is 
recognised as an intangible asset at its fair value at the date 
of acquisition, if it is separable from the acquired business or 
arises from contractual or legal rights. Acquired intangible 
assets, for example, patents and customer relationships, are 
amortised on a straight-line basis over the periods of their 
expected benefit to the Group, which range from three to 
15 years. 
d) Other intangibles  
Other intangible assets mainly comprise certain capitalised 
costs relating to product development, marketing, computer 
software and the global IS/IT system.  
Costs incurred on the development, design and testing of new or 
improved products are capitalised only when the technical and 
commercial feasibility of the product has been proven and prior 
to the product going into full production. Research and other 
development expenditures are charged to the income statement 
in the period in which they are incurred.  
Other intangible assets are amortised on a straight-line basis 
over the periods of their expected benefit to the Group, which 
are in the range of three to ten years. Capitalised costs in 
respect of the core global IS/IT system are being amortised over 
seven years.  
Property, plant and equipment  
(see Note 20)  
Land and buildings mainly comprise manufacturing sites and 
administrative facilities. Plant and machinery mainly comprise 
equipment used in the manufacturing and operating process. 
Assets under the course of construction comprise property, 
plant and equipment which is in the process of being completed 
and not ready for use.  
Property, plant and equipment is stated at historical cost less 
accumulated depreciation and impairment. Historical cost 
includes expenditure that is directly attributable to the 
acquisition of the items. Subsequent costs are included in the 
asset’s carrying amount or recognised as a separate asset, as 
appropriate, only when it is probable that future economic 
benefits associated with the expenditure will flow to the Group 
and the cost of the item can be measured reliably. All repairs 
and maintenance expenditures are charged to the income 
statement during the period in which they are incurred.

3. Other principal accounting policies continued 
Property, plant and equipment continued 
Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method to 
allocate the cost of each asset to its residual value over its 
useful economic life as follows:  
Freehold land  No depreciation
Freehold buildings 20 to 50 years
Leasehold property Period of the lease
Plant and machinery 3 to 28 years
Residual values and useful lives are reviewed at each period-end 
date and adjusted as appropriate, with any resulting changes 
recognised in the income statement prospectively.  
Gains and losses on disposals are determined by comparing the 
disposal proceeds with the carrying amount and are included in 
the income statement.  
Leased assets  
(see Notes 20, 25, 29 and 33)  
Leases of property, plant and equipment where the Group 
assumes substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership 
are classified as finance leases. Assets held under finance 
leases are capitalised at the lower of the fair value of the leased 
asset and the present value of the minimum lease payments. 
The corresponding lease commitments, net of finance charges, 
are included in liabilities. Leasing payments are analysed 
between capital and interest components so that the interest 
element is charged to the income statement over the period of 
the lease at a constant rate of interest.  
Depreciation on assets held under finance leases is charged to 
the income statement, on a straight-line basis over the shorter 
of the lease term and its useful life.  
All other leases are treated as operating leases. The total 
amount payable under the operating lease, including lease 
incentives and guaranteed lease increases, is spread over the 
lease period on a straight-line basis. Where termination or 
extension options are available to the Group, management 
considers whether it is reasonably certain of exercising these 
options in determining the lease period.  
Inventories  
(see Note 15)  
Corn and co-product inventories held in the US business are 
measured at net realisable value since they are considered to be 
agricultural produce after harvest, in accordance with IAS 2.3. 
Gains and losses are recognised in the income statement.  
All other inventories are carried at the lower of cost and net 
realisable value. Cost comprises direct materials and, where 
applicable, direct labour costs and those overheads that have 
been incurred in bringing the inventories to their present 
location and condition and is calc ulated using the ‘first in/first 
out’ or ‘weighted average’ methods, appropriate to the materials 
and production processes involved. Net realisable value 
represents the estimated selling price less all estimated costs 
to completion and costs to be incurred in marketing, selling and 
distribution.  
Provisions are made for any slow moving, obsolete or defective 
inventories.  
Financial instruments  
(see Notes 16, 17, 18, 24, 25, 28 and 29)  
a) Trade receivables  
Trade receivables are initially recognised at fair value, which is 
generally the same as the invoiced amount, and subsequently 
measured at amortised cost, or their recoverable amount. Trade 
receivables are predominantly short term and the effects of 
time-value of money are not considered material.  
Where there is objective evidence that the Group will not be able 
to collect all amounts due according to the original terms of the 
receivable, the receivable is considered to be impaired. 
Significant financial difficulties of the debtor, probability that the 
debtor will enter bankruptcy or financial reorganisation, and 
default or delinquency in payments are considered to be 
objective evidence of impairment. The amount of the 
impairment, and related provision, is the difference between the 
receivable’s original value and the present value of the 
estimated future cash flows, discounted at the original effective 
interest rate. The impairment is recognised in the income 
statement immediately, and the provision is netted against the 
value of the receivable. When a trade receivable is deemed 
uncollectable, it is written off against the related provision.  
Subsequent recoveries of amounts previously written off are 
credited against operating expenses in the income statement in 
the period in which they are recovered.  
b) Trade payables  
Trade payables are predominantly short-term and are initially 
recognised at fair value, which is generally the invoice amount. 
The effects of time-value of mone y are not considered material.  
c) Cash and cash equivalents  
Cash and cash equivalents include cash in hand, deposits held 
at call with banks and other short-term highly liquid 
investments with original maturities of three months or less 
and, for the purposes of the ca sh flow statement only, bank 
overdrafts where the legal right of offset exists. 
d) Available-for-sale financial assets  
Equity instruments held by the Group are generally available-
for-sale and are carried at fair value, with movements in fair 
value recognised in other comprehensive income. The Group 
does not trade equity instruments and does not manage them 
on a fair value basis. Where fair value cannot be reliably 
measured, the assets are carried at cost.  
Cumulative fair value gains or losses on an asset are recycled 
through the income statement when the asset is disposed or 
impaired. A significant or prolonged decline in the fair value of a 
security below its cost is considered as an indicator that the 
securities are impaired. Impairments are recognised in the 
income statement. Impairment losses recognised in profit or 
loss for an investment in an available-for-sale equity instrument 
are not reversed through profit or loss. However, if the fair value 
of an impaired available-for-sale debt security subsequently 
increases and the increase can be related objectively to an event 
occurring after the impairment loss was recognised, then the 
impairment is reversed through profit or loss.  
  
118 Tate & Lyle PLC Annual Report 2017  
  www.tateandlyle.com 119 
e) Borrowings  
Borrowings are initially measured at fair value, net of 
transaction costs incurred, which is generally the amount of 
proceeds received. Borrowings are subsequently measured at 
amortised cost using the effective interest rate method, whereby 
the net proceeds are gradually increased to the amount that will 
be ultimately settled using a constant rate of interest. This 
constant rate of return is used to calculate the amount 
recognised as interest expense in the income statement.  
As explained under ‘Hedge accounting’ (see below), the carrying 
amount of a borrowing may be adjusted where it is a hedged 
liability in a fair value hedge.  
Borrowings are classified as current liabilities unless the Group 
has an unconditional right to defer settlement of the liability for 
at least 12 months after the period-end date.  
Dividends on preference shares that are classified as a liability 
are recognised in the income statement as interest expense.  
f) Derivative financial instruments  
The Group uses derivative financial instruments to reduce its 
exposure to commodity price, currency exchange rate and 
interest rate movements. The Group does not hold or issue 
derivatives for speculative purposes.  
All derivative financial instruments held by the Group are 
recognised as assets or liabilities measured at their fair values 
at the period-end date. As explained under ‘Hedge accounting’ 
below, unless and to the extent that a derivative is in a 
designated and effective cash flow or net investment hedging 
relationship, fair value gains and losses on derivatives are 
recognised in the income statement.  
Derivative financial instruments that are not in a designated 
hedging relationship are classified as held for trading.  
g) Embedded derivatives  
Some contracts may include features that are similar to and 
expose the Group to the same risks as standalone derivatives. 
Where such an embedded derivative is not closely related to the 
host contract and where the host contract itself is not already 
recognised at fair value, the embedded derivative is separated 
from the host contract and accounted as a standalone 
derivative. The hedge accounting principles described below 
equally apply to embedded derivatives.  
h) Offsetting financial instruments  
Financial assets and financial liabilities are offset and the net 
amount presented in the statement of financial position only 
where there is a legally enforceable right to offset them and the 
Group intends to either settle them on a net basis or realise the 
asset and settle the liability simultaneously.  
Hedge accounting  
(see Notes 28 and 29)  
As described in Note 29, the Grou p uses derivatives to mitigate 
risk. In many cases, the changes in the fair value of the 
derivatives are recognised before the hedged risk affects the 
Group income statement. For example, when the Group takes 
out a forward foreign currency contract to fix the exchange  
rate on committed or highly probable future sales in a foreign 
currency, changes in the fair value of the forward foreign 
exchange contract will be recognised in the income statement 
immediately, whereas the future sale will not affect the income 
statement until it is made. This creates a mismatch in the  
timing of recognition for compensating gains and losses.  
Hedge accounting seeks to mitigate this mismatch by applying 
specific accounting rules, if strict criteria are met, to the items 
that create the exposure to risk and the items used to manage  
that risk.  
A hedging relationship principally consists of two items: the 
hedged item and the hedging in strument. The hedged item is 
the transaction or balance that exposes the Group to a risk that 
can be identified and the hedging instrument is the transaction 
or balance that is used to manage the risk. In the above 
example, the contract to sell goods at a future date in a foreign 
currency gives rise to foreign currency transaction exposure for 
the Group. As exchange rates change, the eventual proceeds 
from the future sale when expressed in the entity’s functional 
currency will also change, creating risk. This is the hedged item. 
In this example, the foreign currency exchange contract the 
Group takes out locks in a known functional currency value for 
its foreign currency cash receipt and therefore eliminates the 
volatility in cash flows on the sale. The forward currency 
exchange contract is the hedging instrument.  
For a hedging relationship to qualify for hedge accounting, it 
must be documented at inception together with the Group’s risk 
management objective and strategy for initiating the hedge. The 
hedge must both be expected to be highly effective in offsetting 
the changes in cash flows or fair value attributed to the hedged 
risk and actually be highly effective in doing so. This relationship 
is demonstrated by matching the terms of hedging instruments 
very closely to the hedged items, or where the Group uses more 
complex arrangements, by the use of statistical methods that 
show the relationship between the hedging pairs.  
There are three hedging models that apply to different types of 
transactions.  
a) Cash flow hedges  
Hedging relationships are classified as cash flow hedges where 
the hedging instrument hedges ex posure to variability in cash 
flows that are attributable either to a particular risk associated 
with a recognised asset or liability (such as interest payments on 
variable rate debt), a highly probable forecast transaction (such 
as commodity purchases) or the foreign currency risk in a firm 
commitment (such as the purchase of an item of equipment). 
Where a hedging relationship is classified as a cash flow hedge, 
to the extent that the hedge is effective, changes in the fair value 
of the hedging instrument are recognised in other 
comprehensive income rather than in the income statement. 
When the hedged item affects the income statement, the 
cumulative fair value gain or loss recognised in other 
comprehensive income is transferred to the income statement. 
When a hedged firm commitment results in the recognition of a 
non-current asset, the initial carrying amount of the asset is 
adjusted for the cumulative fair value gain or loss.  
If the hedging instrument expires or is sold, or if the hedging 
relationship no longer meets the conditions for hedge 
accounting, the cumulative fair value gain or loss remains in 
equity until the forecast transaction is recognised in the income 
statement. If a hedged forecast transaction is no longer 
expected to occur, the cumulative fair value gain or loss is 
immediately transferred to the income statement.

3. Other principal accounting policies continued 
Hedge accounting continued 
b) Net investment hedges  
A net investment hedge is the hedge of the currency exposure 
on the retranslation of the Group’s net investment in a foreign 
operation.  
Net investment hedges are accounted for similarly to cash flow 
hedges. Changes in the fair value of the hedging instrument are, 
to the extent that the hedge is effective, recognised in other 
comprehensive income.  
In the event that the foreign operation is disposed of, the cumulative 
fair value gain or loss recognised in other comprehen sive income is 
transferred to the income statement where it is included in the gain 
or loss on disposal of the foreign operation.  
c) Fair value hedges  
Hedging relationships are classified as fair value hedges where 
the hedging instrument hedges the exposure to changes in the 
fair value of a recognised asset or liability that is attributable to a 
particular risk (such as the fair value of fixed rate debt).  
Where the hedging relationship is classified as a fair value 
hedge, the carrying amount of the hedged asset or liability is 
adjusted by the change in its fair value attributable to the hedged 
risk only and the resulting gain or loss is recognised in the 
income statement where, to the extent that the hedge is 
effective, it offsets the fair value gain or loss on the hedging 
instrument.  
Share-based payments  
(see Note 31)  
The Company operates share-based compensation plans under 
which it grants awards over its ordinary shares to its own 
employees and to those of its subsidiaries. All of the awards 
granted under the existing plans are classified as equity-settled 
awards. The Group recognises a compensation expense that is 
based on the fair value of the awards measured at the grant 
date using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. Fair value is 
not subsequently re-measured unless relevant conditions 
attaching to the award are modified.  
Fair value reflects any market performance conditions and all 
non-vesting conditions. Adjustments are made to the 
compensation expense to reflect actual and expected forfeitures 
due to failure to satisfy serv ice conditions or non-market 
performance conditions.  
The resulting compensation expense is recognised in the 
income statement on a straight-line basis over the vesting 
period and a corresponding credit is recognised in equity. In the 
event of the cancellation of an award, whether by the Group or a 
participating employee, the compensation expense that would 
have been recognised over the remainder of the vesting period 
is recognised immediately in the income statement.  
Assets held for sale  
(see Note 8)  
An asset or group of assets is classified as held for sale if its 
carrying amount will be principally recovered through a sale 
transaction rather than through continuing use in the business 
and the following conditions are met:  
• it is available for immediate sale in its present condition;  
• management has committed to, and has initiated, a plan to 
sell the asset; and  
• the sale is expected to complete within 12 months of the 
balance sheet date, and must be highly probable. 
Assets that are classified as held for sale are measured at the 
lower of their carrying amount when they were classified as held 
for sale and their fair value less costs to sell. Any impairment 
loss on a disposal group is allocated first to goodwill and then, 
on a pro-rata basis, to the remaining assets and liabilities other 
than inventories, financial instruments, investment property, 
employee benefits and deferred tax assets, which continue to be 
measured in accordance with the relevant Group accounting 
policies.  
Impairment on the initial recognition of held for sale assets, and 
gains or losses on subsequent re-measurement, are recognised 
in the income statement.  
Once classified as held for sale, property, plant and equipment 
and intangible assets are no long er depreciated or amortised. 
Equity accounted investments are no longer equity accounted 
when classified as held for sale.  
Accounting standards issued but not yet 
adopted  
The following new standards have been issued and are relevant 
to the Group, but were not effective for the financial year 
beginning 1 April 2016, and ha ve not been adopted early: 
a) IFRS 15 – Revenue from Contracts with Customers 
(effective for the year ending 31 March 2019) 
The Group has undertaken a review of its commercial 
arrangements across all significant revenue streams and 
geographies including assessing the timing of revenue 
recognition as well as focusing on the accounting for principal 
and agency relationships, consignment stocks and discounts 
provided. As a result of the review, the Group has concluded that 
the adoption of IFRS 15 is not expected to have a material 
impact on reported revenue or revenue growth rates, and will 
continue to review its contracts and transactions with 
customers to ensure compliance with IFRS 15 on adoption. 
b) IFRS 9 – Financial Instruments (effective for the year 
ending 31 March 2019) 
The Group has undertaken a review of the key areas of IFRS 9 
focused principally on classification and measurement of 
financial assets and liabilities, impairment of financial assets 
and hedge accounting. The Group has concluded that the 
adoption of IFRS 9 will not ha ve a material impact on its 
consolidated results or financial position, and will continue to 
review its activities in these areas to ensure compliance with 
IFRS 9 upon adoption. 
c) IFRS 16 – Leases (effective for the year ending 31 March 
2020) 
The standard eliminates the classification of leases as either 
operating or finance leases and introduces a single accounting 
model, and will require the Group to recognise substantially all 
of its current operating lease commitments on the statement of 
financial position. The financial impact of this, together with any 
other implications of the standard, will be assessed during the 
2018 financial year. 
There are no other new standards, new interpretations or 
amendments to standards or interpretations that have been 
published that are expected to have a significant impact on the 
Group’s financial statements.

4. Reconciliation of alternative performance measures 
For the reasons set out in Note 1, the Group presents alternat ive performance measures including adjusted operating profit, 
adjusted profit before tax and adjusted earnings per share.  
For the years presented, these alternative performance measures exclude, where relevant: 
• exceptional items  
• the amortisation of acquired intangible assets 
• net retirement benefit interest 
• tax on the above items and tax items that themselves meet these definitions.

The Group also presents two alternative cash flow measures which are defined as follows: 
(a) Adjusted free cash flow represents cash generated from continuing operations excluding the impact of exceptional 
items, less net interest paid, less income tax paid, less capital expenditure.  
(b) Adjusted operating cash flow is defined as adjusted free cash flow from continuing operations, adding back net 
interest paid, tax paid and retirement cash contributions, and excluding derivative and margin call movements 
within working capital.

The Group presents certain financial measures as defined in its ex ternal financial covenants as well as return on capital emplo yed 
(ROCE) metrics as Key Performance Indicato rs. Net debt to EBITDA and interest cove r are defined under the Group’s financial 
covenants and reported on a proportionate consolidation basis. Fo r financial covenant purposes these ratios are calculated base d 
on the accounting standards that applied for the 2014 financia l year, with new accounting standards adopted by the Group 
subsequent to 1 April 2014 disregarded. Net debt is calculated using average currency exchange rates. Average invested operatin g 
capital represents the average at the beginning and end of the period of shareholders’ equity excluding net debt, net tax 
assets/liabilities, investment in joint ventures and associates and net retirement benefit obligations. All ratios are calculat ed based 
on unrounded figures in £ million. The following tables present the calculation of these alternative measures:

5. Segment information 
Segment information is presented on a consistent basis with the information presented to the Board (the designated Chief Operat ing 
Decision Maker) for the purposes of allocating resources within the Group and assessing the performance of the Group’s 
businesses. Continuing operations comprise two operating segments: Speciality Food Ingredients and Bulk Ingredients. Central, 
which comprises central costs including head office, treasury and re-insurance activities, does not meet the definition of an 
operating segment under IFRS 8 ‘Operating Segments’ but no subtotal is shown for the Group’s two operating segments in the 
tables below so as to be consistent with the presentation of segment information presented to the Board. Both segments are serv ed 
by a single manufacturing network, and receive services from a number of global support functions. The segmental allocation of 
costs is performed using standard product costs to allocate all direct costs (including plant-based depreciation) and allocatio n keys 
for all indirect costs (including share-based payments and amorti sation) which reflect the value of service provided to each 
operating unit, consistently applied over time. 
The Board uses adjusted operating profit as the measure of the profitability of the Group’s businesses. Adjusted operating prof it is, 
therefore, the measure of segment profit presented in the Group’s segment disclosures. Adjusted operating profit represents 
operating profit before specific items that are considered to hinder comparison of the trad ing performance of the Group’s 
businesses year-on-year. During the years presented, the items excluded from operating profit in arriving at adjusted operating 
profit were the amortisation of acquired intangible assets and exceptional items. The segmental classification of exceptional i tems is 
detailed in Note 7. 
An analysis of total assets and total liabilities by operating segment is not presented to the Board but it does receive segmen tal 
analysis of net working capital (inventories, trade and other receivables, less trade and other payables). Accordingly, the amo unts 
presented for segment assets and segment liabilities in the tabl es below represent those assets and liabilities that comprise

The Group’s adjusted effective tax rate on continuing operations, calculated on the basis of the adjusted income tax expense of  
£49 million (2016 – £32 million) as a proportion of adjusted profit before tax of £271 million (2016 – £193 million) was 18.2%  
(2016 – 16.5%). 
The Group’s reported tax rate on continuing operations, calculated on the basis of the reported income tax credit of £22 millio n  
(2016 – charge of £5 million) as a proportion of profit before tax of £233 million (2016 – £126 million) was a credit of 9.6%  
(2016 – charge of 4.0%). 
The Group’s income tax credit for the year ended 31 March 2017 of £22 million (2016 – charge of £5 million) is stated after 
recognition of a net deferred tax credit of £45 million (2016 – £25 million). The deferred tax credit comprises exceptional def erred tax 
credits of £65 million (2016 – £nil) partially offset by underlying net deferred tax charges of £20 million (2016 – £25 million net credit).  
Exceptional deferred tax credits recognised in the year of £65 million comprised two items. Firstly, changes to UK tax legislat ion and 
the Group’s internal financing structure which led to the recognition of an exceptional deferred tax credit of £34 million aris ing from 
previously unrecognised tax losses in the UK, which, based on enacted legislation, are now expected to be utilised against futu re UK 
taxable profits. Secondly, the Group also transferred at fair value its sucralose intellectual property assets from the UK to the US. 
This transfer led to the recognition of an exceptional deferred tax credit of £31 million. Further details can be found in Note 7. 
The Group’s adjusted income tax charge of £49 million (2016 – £32 million) is stated before the exceptional deferred tax credit s 
above, and the tax impact of the adjustments made between reported and adjusted profit before tax (being adjustments for 
amortisation of acquired intangibles, exceptional items in operating profit and net retirement benefit interest items). 
The standard rate of corporation tax in the UK reduced from 20% to 19% with effect from 1 April 2017 and is expected to reduce 
from 19% to 17% with effect from 1 April 2020. 
The Group recognised no tax charge in the UK in the year (2016 – £nil), as costs, together with brought forward losses, exceede d 
current year taxable income. The remaining UK losses have been tr eated as partially recoverable in future periods, as reflected in 
the deferred tax asset booked for the year (see page 137). 
At 31 March 2017, the carrying value of current tax assets tota lled £1 million (2016 – £3 million) and the carrying value of th e current 
tax liabilities totalled £57 million (2016 – £66 million).

Reconciliation of the effective tax rate  
As the Group’s head office and parent company are domiciled in the UK, the Group uses the UK corporation tax rate to reference its 
effective tax rate, notwithstanding that only a small proportion of the Group’s business is in the UK. The tax on the Group’s p rofit

1 The Group’s tax rate is favourably affected by its internal financing arrangements which involve borrowing by its US operations from the UK, the interest on which has the 
effect of reducing the amount of tax payable.  
2 The Group benefits from certain tax incentives available to manufacturing companies.  
3 The Group incurs expenses in jurisdictions where it does not currently expect to be able to recover these amounts against futur e taxable profits. This has the effect of 
increasing the Group’s overall effective tax rate.  
4 The Group undertook certain intragroup transactions in the 2017 financial year which resulted in the recognition of deferred ta x assets in respect of UK losses now expected 
to be utilised. This amount comprised the exceptional credit of £34 million relating to the Gr oup’s internal financing transaction and an exceptional credit of £31 million 
relating to the sale of Sucralose IP. 
5 The Group benefited from the favourable settlement of certain prior year ta x matters in the previous year.  
6 The Group is subject to tax rates in the jurisdictions in which it operates which are above the UK corporation tax rate (the Gr oup’s reference rate) leading to an increase in 
total tax charge. 
Key factors impacting the sustainability of the effective tax rate are as follows:  
1. Our ability to continue to operate an efficient internal financing arrangement  
One of our internal financing arrangements involves borrowing by our US operations from the UK, the interest on which has the 
effect of reducing the amount of tax payable. This delivered a benefit of £21 million in the 2017 financial year (2016 – £25 mi llion).  
As a result of recent changes in UK legislation arising from th e OECD’s Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS) project and cha nges 
to the internal financing arrangements we use to fund our inte rnational businesses, we have recognised a deferred tax asset of  
£34 million arising from previously unrecognised tax losses in th e UK, which are now expected to be utilised against future UK 
taxable profits. In the current period, the recognition of this deferred tax asset lowers the reported effective tax rate (on s tatutory 
earnings). If our ability to operate this revised arrangement was constrained in the future, due to legislative change or other factors, 
our tax rate could increase materially. 
2. The timing of recognising tax benefits from brought forward losses in the UK  
The Group expects to recognise taxable profits in the UK in futu re periods and, as such, has recognised historical losses in th e form 
of deferred tax assets expected to be utilised to offset these profits. However, legislative changes in the UK have been announ ced 
which will restrict the utilisation of these brought forward losses by 50%. Upon substantive enactment of these changes, the Gr oup 
will be required to adjust the deferred tax asset recognised in respect of historical losses, which is expected to lead to a si gnificant 
taxation charge in the Group’s income statement. To the extent that UK taxable profits exceed current year losses in any subseq uent 
year, the Group’s ability to relieve these profits against prior year losses will be limited, resulting in a UK tax charge. 
3. Material changes in the geographic mix of profits  
The Group’s effective tax rate is sensitive to the geographic mix of profits and reflects a combination of higher rates in certain 
jurisdictions such as the US, nil effective rates in the UK due to the availability of losses and rates that lie somewhere in b etween.  
If the geographic mix of profits were to change materially, through changes in the composition of the Group’s business or chang es 
in performance, our tax rate could change materially.

12. Income taxes continued 
Key factors impacting the sustainability of the effective tax rate are as follows continued:  
4. Changes in tax rates  
Changes in tax rates in the jurisdictions in which the Group oper ates could have a material effect on the Group’s effective tax rate. 
An increase in geopolitical uncertainties in the US (following the election of President Trump) and elsewhere, increases the 
likelihood of material tax reform. The precise nature of any such reform, and its impact on the Group, remains uncertain. 
5. Resolution of tax judgements arising from current or future tax issues  
At any one time, the Group can be subject to a number of challeng es by tax authorities in the ju risdictions in which it operates.  
The outcome of these challenges is inherently uncertain, pote ntially resulting in a different tax charge from the amounts  
initially provided. 
At 31 March 2017, the Group carried a central provision in resp ect of uncertain tax positions totalling £34 million (2016 – £31 million) 
within current tax payables. Based on all substantively enacted le gislation, the Group believes that no reasonably possible cha nge in 
assumptions would lead to a material change in this number. 
Exceptional deferred tax credits 
In the year ended 31 March 2017, the Group recognised exceptiona l deferred tax credits totalling £65 million in respect of rece nt 
changes to UK tax legislation and the Group’s internal financing structure, and a transfer of intellectual property assets rela ted to

1 During the year the Group rationalised ownership of its Sucralose IP to align it with the underlying US manufacturing base. This resulted in the recognition of a deferred tax 
asset of £31 million. Other deferred tax items include temporary differences arising from accounting provisions, where the timi ng of the tax deduction is different from the 
timing of accounting recognition, and business combinations.  
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset where there is a le gally enforceable right of offset and there is an intention t o settle the 
balances net. After taking these offsets into account, the net position of £3 million liability (2016 – £18 million liability) is presented as 
a £22 million deferred tax asset (2016 – £3 million asset) and a £25 million deferred tax liability (2016 – £21 million liabili ty) in the 
Group’s statement of financial position.

12. Income taxes continued 
Deferred tax continued 
Changes in enacted tax rates had no effect on the amount of deferred tax charged to the income statement and other 
comprehensive income or equity. There was no impact from the imposition of new taxes. No deferred tax assets have been 
recognised in respect of tax losses of £508 million (2016 – £753 million) as there is uncertainty as to whether taxable profits against 
which these assets may be recovered, will be available. No unrelieved tax losses expi red under current tax legislation in the y ear 
ended 31 March 2017.  
The total deferred tax on unremitted earnings is £3 million (2016 – £4 million) of which £2 million (2016 – £nil) has been reco gnised. 
The Group has not recognised the full amount as it is able to control the timing of the reversal of certain of these temporary 
differences and it is not probable that they will reverse in the foreseeable future. 
Discontinued operations 
The income tax charge in respect of discontinued operations (Note 8) in the year ended 31 March 2017 was £nil (2016 – £5 millio n). 
The prior year charge reflected an exceptional cost in respect of historical tax matters at the Moroccan facility, which the Gr oup sold 
to ADM during the 2017 financial year.

Tax on items recognised directly in equity  
A deferred tax credit of £3 million, in relation to share-based payments, was recognised directly in equity (2016 – £3 million charge). 
13. Earnings per share 
Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the profit at tributable to owners of the Company by the weighted average number 
of ordinary shares in issue during the year, excluding an averag e of 4 million shares (2016 – 4 million shares) held by the Com pany 
or the Employee Benefit Trust to satisfy awards made under the Group’s share-based incentive plans. 
Diluted earnings per share is calculated by adjusting the weig hted average number of ordinary shares in issue to assume 
conversion of potentially dilutive ordinary shares, reflecting vesting assumptions on employee share plans, as well as the prof it 
attributable to owners of the Company for any proceeds on such conversions. Potentially dilutive ordinary shares arise from awa rds 
made under the Group’s share-based incentive plans. Where the vesting of these awards is contingent on satisfying a service or 
performance condition, the number of potentially dilutive ordinary shares is calculated based on the status of the condition at the 
end of the period. Potentially dilutive ordi nary shares are dilutive only when the average market price of the Company’s ordina ry 
shares during the period exceeds their exercise price (options) or issue price (other awards). Otherwise, the effect of exercis ing such 
options or awards would be to increase the earnings per share rather than to dilute. 
The greater any such excess, the greater the dilutive effect. The average market price of the Company’s ordinary shares during the 
year was 695p (2016 – 574p). The dilutive effect of share-based incentives was 7.1 million shares (2016 – 3.4 million shares).

(i) Impairment tests carried out during the year  
The Group is principally operated as an integrated network in th e United States and Europe, with a large amount of interdepende ncy 
between plants servicing both the Speciality Food Ingredients an d Bulk Ingredients segments. Goodwill is therefore tested for 
impairment on a geographical basis, except where it can be allocated to a specific CGU.

19. Goodwill and other intangible assets continued 
(i) Impairment tests carried out during the year continued 
A description of the impairment tests conducted in relation to th e most significant goodwill amounts are set out as follows. In 
each case, the recoverable amount was calculated based on value in use, with the exception of Brazilian Food Systems business 
Tate & Lyle Gemacom Tech Indústria e Comércio S.A. (’Gemaco m’), Tate & Lyle Boleraz s.r.o and Tate & Lyle Sweden AB 
(‘Biovelop’). Value in use was calculated based on budgets and plans covering the next five years that have been approved by th e 
Board. Cash flows were projected during the five-year period based on budgeted operating profit and management’s expectations 
of market developments. Beyond the five-year plan, cash flows we re generally assumed to grow at the long-term growth rate for 
the relevant geographical markets based on forecasts included in industry reports. Cash flows were discounted using pre-tax rat es 
that are based on the Group’s weighted average cost of capital adjusted, where appropriate, to reflect differences between the risk 
profile of the geographical areas or CGUs concerned and that of the Group as a whole. 
Goodwill allocated by geographical area  
United States  
Goodwill allocated to the US single ingred ients operations of £74 million (2016 – £65 million) relates to the Staley acquisitio n in 1988. 
The key assumptions in the model are derived from the Group’s Annual Operating Plan for 2018 and Board-approved five-year plan, 
which includes mid-single-digit volume growth in Speciality Food Ingredients and flat volumes in Bulk Ingredients. Operating pr ofit 
is assumed to increase by low single digits for both Speciality Food Ingredients and Bulk Ingredients, based on management’s  
long-term industry expectations. Based on the risk profile of th e assets tested, cash flows were discounted using a pre-tax rat e of 
8.8% (2016 – 9.6%). Significant headroom exists and ma nagement concluded that no impairment is required. 
Goodwill allocated by operating segment  
Speciality Food Ingredients  
Goodwill allocated to the Speciality Food Ingredients segment includes £63 million (2016 – £58 million) that relates to the Eur opean 
Food Systems acquisitions of G.C. Hahn and Company in June 2007 and that of Cesalpinia Foods in December 2005. As these 
businesses are operationally integrated, they are tested for impair ment as one CGU. The key assumptions in the model are derive d 
from the Group’s Annual Operating Plan for 2018. Volumes are expect ed to grow at a mid-single di git compound annual growth rate 
over the subsequent four years and the model anticipates a recovery to profitability over the five-year timeframe. Cash flows w ere 
discounted using a pre-tax rate of 8.8% (2016 – 9.6%). Management concluded that no impairment is required. 
During the year ended 31 March 2016, the Group completed the re -alignment of the Eaststarch joint venture whereby the remaining 
50% of Amylum Slovakia s.r.o. was purchased (subsequently rename d Tate & Lyle Boleraz s.r.o.). This entity has goodwill of  
£43 million (2016 – provisionally recorded as £35 million at the acquisition date of 31 October 2015 (see Note 34)). The acquis ition 
business case assumes expansion beyond normal maintenance ca pital expenditure and the recoverable amount was determined 
based on fair value less costs of disposal. The fair value was de termined based on a discounted cash flow model using a post-ta x 
discount rate and cash inflows and outflows from future expansion. Cash flows from 2018 onwards are expected to grow at a  
mid-single digit compound annual ra te over the subsequent four years. Cash flows were discounted using a post-tax rate of 7.1%. 
Management concluded that no impairment is required. 
Goodwill allocated to the Speciality Food Ingredients segment includes £23 million (pre-impairment) (2016 – £18 million) that r elates 
to Gemacom. The impairment model assumes expansion beyond normal maintenance capital expenditure and the recoverable 
amount was calculated based on fair value less costs of disposal . The fair value was determined based on a discounted cash flow 
model using a post-tax discount rate and ca sh inflows and outflows from future expansion. The model assumes a return to 
profitability over the first two years with volume and contribution margin growth in low double digits over the five years. Lon g-term 
growth rate is assumed to be 5% thereafter, reflecting the long-term growth expectations for this market. Cash flows were 
discounted using a post-tax rate of 12% (2016 – 14% post-tax). It was concluded that the recoverable amount of this CGU was low er 
than its carrying value. As a result of this analysis, manageme nt has recognised an impairment charge of £16 million which has 
been recognised within other expenses as an exceptional item. Refer to Note 7 for further details.  
Goodwill of £10 million allocated to the Speciality Food Ingred ients segment relates to the acqu isition of Biovelop, the PromOat
®
 
Beta Glucan plant in Sweden, in the 2014 financial year. The ke y assumptions in the model are de rived from the Group’s Annual 
Operating Plan for 2018, and the model assumes significant operat ing profit growth as the facility expansion is completed. 
Management concluded that no impairment is required. Cash flows were discounted using a post-tax rate of 7.1% (2016 – 7.8%). 
However, this calculation resulted in a lo w level of headroom compared with the carryi ng value as growth has been below the lev el 
in the prior year’s model. The amount of headroom was particular ly sensitive to the discount rate and volumes sold. Reasonably 
possible changes in these assumptions, being changes in excess of an increase in the discount rate of 30bps, and a reduction in 
volumes sold of 200bps could lead to an impairment.  
There are no other individually material elements of goodwill allocated to either the Speciality Food Ingredients or Bulk Ingre dients 
operating segments. 
(ii) Possibility of impairment in the near future  
Management considers that, with the exception of Biovelop, there is no reasonably possible change in one or more of the key 
assumptions used in the impairment tests for goodwill and other in tangible assets that would give rise to an impairment loss  
during the coming year.

Tate & Lyle Howbetter Food Co., Ltd, the Group recognised a £1 million charge (see Note 7). Management conducted impairment 
reviews of other property, plant and equipment during the year and concluded that there were no other impairments.  
In the year ended 31 March 2016, the Group recognised an impairment charge of £1 million related to assets in the European Food 
Systems business.

Net investment hedges  
The Group employs currency swap contracts to hedge the currency risk associated with its net in vestments in subsidiaries located 
primarily in the US and Europe. The notional principal amounts of the outstanding currency swap contracts applied in net 
investment hedging relationships as of 31 March 2017 were £1 82 million (2016 – £161 million). Within net investment hedging 
gains/losses, a fair value loss of £21 million (2016 – £8 million loss) on translation of the currency swap contracts to pounds sterling 
at the period-end date was recognised in the transl ation reserve in shareholders’ equity (Note 23).  
In addition, at 31 March 2017, of the Group’s liabilities, a total of £188 million (2016 – £312 million) are designated as hedg es of the 
net investments in foreign operations.

Management of financial risk 
The key financial risks faced by the Group are credit risk, liquidity risk and market risks, which include interest rate risk, foreign 
exchange risk and certain commodity price risks. The Board regularly reviews these risks and approves written policies covering the 
use of financial instruments to manage these risks and sets over all risk limits. The derivative financial instruments approved by the 
Board of Tate & Lyle PLC to manage financial risks include swaps, both interest rate and currency, swaptions, caps, forward rat e 
agreements, foreign exchange and commodity forward contracts and options, and commodity futures.  
The Chief Financial Officer retains overall responsibility for management of financial risk for the Group. Most of the Group’s 
financing, interest rate and foreign exchange risk are managed through the Group treasury company, Tate & Lyle International 
Finance PLC, whose operations are directed by its board. Tate & Lyle International Finance PLC arranges funding and manages 
interest rate, foreign exchange and bank counterparty risks within limits approved by the Board of Tate & Lyle PLC.  
Commodity price risks are managed through divisional commodity trading functions in the US and Europe. These functions are 
controlled by divisional management who are responsible for ratifying general strategy and overseeing performance on a monthly 
basis. The performance of the commodity trading function is monitored against its ability to match the Group’s needs for raw 
materials with purchase contracts, as well as the Group’s output of co-products with sales contracts. Commodity price contracts 
are categorised as being held either for trading or for hedging price exposures. The Group applies a limited level of hedge 
accounting to its economic price exposure hedges.

Market risks 
Foreign exchange management  
The Group operates internationally and is exposed to foreign exch ange risks arising from commercial transactions (transaction 
exposure), and from recognised assets, liabilities and investments in foreign operations (translation exposure).  
Transaction exposure  
The Group’s policy requires subsidiaries to hedge transactiona l currency exposures against their functional currency once the 
transaction is committed or highly probable, mainly through the us e of forward foreign exchange contracts, although exceptions can 
be approved by the Chief Financial Officer. The amounts deferred in equity from derivative financial instruments designated as cash 
flow hedges are released to the income statement or statement of financial position and offset against the movement in underlyi ng 
transactions only when the forecast transactions affect the inco me statement or statement of financial position respectively.  
Translation exposure  
The Group manages the foreign exchange exposure to net investments in overseas operations, particularly in the US and Europe,  
by borrowing principally in US dollars, which provide a partia l match for the Group’s major foreign currency assets. The Group also 
manages some of its foreign exchange exposure to net investments in foreign operations through the use of currency swap 
contracts and other liabilities. The amount deferred in equity fr om the hedging instruments designated as net investment hedges is 
offset against the foreign currency translation effect of the ne t investment in foreign operations, and is released to the inco me 
statement upon disposal of those investments.  
The following table illustrates only the Group’s sensitivity to the fluctuation of the Group’s major currencies against sterlin g on its 
income statement and other components of equity, assuming that ea ch exchange rate moves in isolation. The equity impact for 
foreign exchange sensitivity relates to derivative and non-deri vative financial instruments hedging the Group’s net investments in its 
European and US operations.

Interest rate management  
The Group has an exposure to interest rate risk, arising princi pally from changes in US dollar, sterling and euro interest rate s. This 
risk is managed by fixing or capping portions of debt using in terest rate derivatives to achieve a target level of fixed/floati ng rate net 
debt, which aims to optimise net finance expense and reduce volati lity in reported earnings. The Group’s policy is that between 30% 
and 75% of Group net debt is fixed for more than one year and th at no interest rates are fixed for more than 12 years. At 31 Ma rch 
2017, the longest term of any fixed rate debt held by the Grou p was until October 2027 (2016 – October 2027). The proportion of net 
debt managed by the Group’s treasury function at 31 March 2017 that was fixed or capped for more than one year was 65%  
(2016 – 60%).  
The Group considers a 100 basis point change in interest rates a re asonably possible change except where rates are less than  
100 basis points. In these instances it is assumed that the inte rest rates increase by 100 basis points and decrease to zero fo r the 
purpose of performing the sensitivity analysis. The impact is calculated with reference to the gross debt and cash held as at  
31 March 2017 assuming that other variables remain unchanged.  
As at 31 March 2017, if interest rates increased by 100 basis poin ts, Group profit before tax would decrease by £2 million (201 6 –  
£1 million). If interest rates decreased by 100 basis points, or less where applicable, Group profit before tax would increase by  
£1 million (2016 – £1 million increase). 
Price risk management 
The Group participates mainly in four markets: food and beverage ; industrial ingredients; pharmaceutical and personal care; and 
animal feed. Food and beverage and industrial ingredients are th e most significant. All ingredients are produced from renewable 
crops, predominantly corn.  
The Group is exposed to movements in the future prices of co mmodities in those domestic and international markets where the 
Group buys and sells corn (and related co-p roducts) and energy for production. Commodity futures, forwards and options are used 
where available to hedge inventories and the costs of raw materi als for unpriced and prospective contracts not covered by forwa rd 
product sales. Some of the contracts are used to hedge co-product pricing, for which there is no active market. The pricing is 
established by the Group, based on a number of inputs, as discussed on pages 112 to 113. Due to the seasonality of corn product ion, 
at certain points in time throughout the year, the expo sure to commodity pricing contracts may be higher.  
As at 31 March 2017, a 50% increase/decrease in the price of corn will result in a decrease/increase to the income statement of  
£3 million (2016 – £nil) and related decrease/increase in other components of equity of £nil (2016 – £1 million).

29. Financial instruments – fair value and risk management continued 
Credit risk management 
Counterparty credit risk arises from the placing of deposits and entering into derivative financial instrument contracts with b anks 
and financial institutions, as well as credit exposures inherent within the Group’s outstanding receivables.  
The Group manages credit risk by entering into financial instru ment contracts substantially with investment grade counterpartie s 
approved by the Board.  
The Board has approved maximum counterparty exposure limits for specified banks and financial institutions based on the long-
term credit ratings of Standard & Poor’s and Moody’s. Trading limits assigned to commercial customers are based on ratings from 
Dun & Bradstreet and Credit Risk Monitor. In cases where publis hed financial ratings are not available or inconclusive, credit 
application, reference checking, and obtaining of customers’ financial information such as liquidity and turnover ratio, are re quired 
to evaluate customers’ credit worthiness. 
Analysis of maximum credit exposure 
Counterparties’ positions are monitored on a regular basis to ensu re that they are within the approved limits and there are no 
significant concentrations of credit risks.  
The Group’s trade receivables are short term in nature and la rgely comprise amounts receivable from business customers. 
Concentrations of credit risk with respect to trade receivables are limited, with our customer base including large, unrelated and 
internationally dispersed customers. 
The Group considers its maximum exposure to cr edit risk at the year-end date is the carrying value of each class of financial a ssets 
as disclosed under financial instruments by category on page 155. 
Analysis of amounts set-off 
The Group does not offset financial assets and liabilities in its statement of financial position as the Group has no intention to net 
settle, except as described below. 
Derivative assets and liabilities of £17 million (2016 – £19 millio n) could be offset under an enforceable master netting agree ment. 
Amounts which do not meet the criteria for offsetting in the st atement of financial position but could be settled net in certai n 
circumstances principally relate to derivative transactions un der International Swaps and Derivatives Association (ISDA) agreem ents 
where each party has the option to settle amounts on a net basis in the event of default of the other party. 
Liquidity risk management 
The Group manages its exposure to liquidity risk and ensures maximum flexibility in meeting changing business needs by 
maintaining access to a wide range of funding sources, including capital markets and bank borrowings. Capital market issues 
outstanding at 31 March 2017 are listed in Note 25.  
At the year end, the Group held cash and cash equivalents of £261 million (2016 – £317 million) and had committed undrawn 
facilities of £638 million (2016 – £556 million). These resources are maintained to provide liquidity back-up and to meet the p rojected 
maximum cash outflow from debt repayment, capital expenditure and seasonal working capital needs foreseen for at least a year 
into the future at any one time. 
The Group has a core committed bank facility of US$800 million, of which US$80 million matures in 2020 and US$720 million in 
2021. This facility is unsecured and contains financial covenants for the Group th at the interest cover ratio should not be les s than 
2.5 times and the multiple of net debt to EBITDA, as defined in our financial covenants, should not be greater than 3.5 times. Refer 
to Note 4 for the calculation of these measures for financial co venant purposes. The Group monitors compliance against all its 
financial obligations and it is Group policy to manage the consolidated statement of financial position so as to operate well w ithin 
these covenanted restrictions. In both the current and comparat ive reporting periods, the Group complied with its financial 
covenants at all measurement points. The majority of the Group’ s borrowings are raised through the Group treasury company, 
Tate & Lyle International Finance PLC, and are then on-l ent to the business units on an arm’s length basis.  
Current Group policy is to ensure that, after taking into accoun t the total of undrawn committed facilities, no more than 10% o f gross 
debt matures within 12 months and at least 35% matures beyond 2.5 years. At 31 March 2017, after taking account of undrawn 
committed facilities, the Group was compliant with the policy. Th e average maturity of the Group’s gross debt was 6.2 years (20 16 – 
6.6 years), taking account of undrawn committed facilities.

Capital risk management 
The Group’s primary objectives in managing its capital are to safeguard the business as a going concern; to maintain the divide nd 
policy; to maintain sufficient financial flexibility to undertake its investment plans; and to retain an investment grade credi t rating 
which enables access to debt capital marke ts. The Group’s financial profile and level of financial risk is assessed on a regula r basis 
in the light of changes to the economic conditions, business environment, the Group’s business profile and the risk characteris tics 
of its businesses.  
Tate & Lyle has contractual relationships with Moody’s and Standard & Poor’s (S&P) for the provision of credit ratings. At 31 M arch 
2017, the long-term credit rating from Moody’s was Baa2 (stable outlook) and from S&P was BBB (stable outlook).  
The Group regards its total capital as follows:

The Board has set two ongoing key performance indicators (KPIs) to measure the Group’s financial strength. The target levels fo r 
these financial KPIs are that the ratio of net debt/EBITDA should not exceed two times and interest cover should exceed five ti mes.

30. Retirement benefit obligations 
a) Plan information 
(i) Pensions 
The Group operates a number of defined benefit pension plans, principally in the UK and the US. Generally, the pension benefits 
provided under these plans are determined based on the pensionabl e salary and period of pensionable service of the individual 
members. Most of the plans are funded and the plan assets held separately from those of the Group in funds that are under the 
control of trustees. The extent of the powers of the trustees, in particular in respect of funding and investment strategy, var ies and is 
dependent on local regulations and the rules of each plan.  
Payments made by the Group to the plans principally comprise fu nding contributions agreed with the trustees that are determined 
in accordance with local regulations to ensure that appropriate funding levels are maintained and funding deficits are eliminat ed 
over a reasonable period of time. All of the significant defined benefit pension plans operated by the Group are closed to new 
entrants and to future accrual.  
The Group operates defined contribution pension plans in a number of countries. Contributions payable by the Group to these pla ns 
during the year amounted to £7 million (2016 – £4 million). 
(ii) Other benefits 
The Group’s subsidiaries in the US provid e unfunded retirement medical plans to the majority of their employees. Such plans 
provide financial assistance in meeting various costs including medical, dental and prescription drugs. Employees are required to 
contribute to the cost of benefits received under the plans. The Group meets the remaining costs of providing these benefits in the 
period in which they are incurred.

30. Retirement benefit obligations continued 
In the UK, members can elect to forego a portion of their future pension benefits, in return for a lump sum payment, or a trans fer 
out to other arrangements. These amounts are excluded from future benefit projections. 
The pension benefits paid in respect of US plans, in the 2017 financial year were £35 million higher than those projected for t he  
2018 financial year, due to the settlement made by some deferred members during the year which resulted in the recognition of a  
£9 million exceptional gain (as detailed in Note 7c). 
At 31 March 2017, the weighted average duration of the significant defined benefit obligations was as follows: 
  Duration 
Pension plans:  
– UK  16 years
– US  11 years
Medical benefits  10 years
Assumptions 
For accounting purposes, the benefit obligation of each plan has been calculated in accordance with IAS 19 based on data gather ed 
for the most recent actuarial valuation and by applying assumpti ons made by the Group on the advice of independent actuaries. 
The principal assumptions used in calculating the benefit obligation were as follows: 
At 31 March 2017  UK  US
Inflation rate 2.3/3.3%  2.5%
Expected rate of salary increases n/a  3.5%
Expected rate of pension increases:   
– deferred pensions 2.3%  n/a
– pensions in payment 3.1%  n/a
Discount rate 2.4%  4.0%
    
At 31 March 2016 UK  US 
Inflation rate 2.0/3.0%  2.5%
Expected rate of salary increases n/a  3.5%
Expected rate of pension increases:   
– deferred pensions 2.0%  n/a
– pensions in payment 2.8%  n/a
Discount rate 3.4%  3.8%
Assumptions regarding future mortality rates of members of the Group’s pension plans are based on published statistics and take 
into account the profile of the plan members. On this basis, th e average life expectancies assumed for members of the plans are  
as follows: 
  At 31 March 2017 At 31 March 2016
  UK US UK  US 
Male aged 65 now 21.6 years 20.9 years 22.7 years  21.2 years
Male aged 65 in 20 years’ time 23.7 years 22.5 years 26.6 years  22.9 years
Female aged 65 now 23.8 years 22.9 years 23.9 years  23.2 years
Female aged 65 in 20 years’ time 26.1 years 24.5 years 27.0 years  24.9 years
Shorter longevity assumptions are used for members who retire on grounds of ill health.

Medical benefits 
Principal assumptions used in calculating th e benefit obligation are medical cost inflation and the discount rate applied to th e 
expected benefit payments. The Group has assumed medical cost infl ation at 8.0% per annum (2016 – 6.0%), grading down to 5% by 
2023, and used a discount rate of 3.9% (2016 – 3.6%).  
At 31 March 2017, the sensitivity of the net deficit on the plan s to changes in the principal assumptions was as follows (assum ing in 
each case that the other assumptions are unchanged):

The fair value of the insurance policies are deemed to be equi valent to the present value of the related benefit obligation.  
The Group also paid an additional £4 million (2016 – £4 million) to the US unfunded retirement me dical plans to meet the cost o f 
providing the benefits in the financial year. 
Plan assets do not include any direct investments in securities issued by the Group or any property occupied by or other assets  
used by the Group. Assets are classified as quoted only if they have a quoted market price in an active market as defined by IF RS 13 
‘Fair Value Measurement’. 
All other assets are classified as unquoted. 
Where a plan is in surplus, the surplus recognised is limited to the present value of any amounts that the Group expects to rec over 
by way of refunds or a reduction in future contributions. The Group considers that it has an unconditional right to the surplus 
relating to the UK plan as the scheme rules state that any surp lus should be returned to the Group in the event that there are no 
members left in the pension scheme. 
c) Mitigation of risk 
The defined benefit pension plans expose the Group to actuarial risks such as interest rate, longevity, inflation and investmen t risk.  
The Group encourages the trustees of the plans to adopt an invest ment policy that seeks to miti gate these risks, which involves 
investing a significant proportion of the plan assets in liabilit y-driven investment portfolios that mitigate interest rate, in flation and 
investment risks. The Group seeks to ensure that, as far as prac ticable, the investment portfolios of the funded plans are inve sted in 
long-term fixed interest securities with matu rities and in currencies that match the expected future benefit payments as they f all 
due. In the UK, interest rate derivatives are used to achieve close matching where matching fixed-interest securities are not 
available in the market. Most of the inflation risk for the Group arises in the UK since deferred pensions and pensions in paym ent in 
the US do not attract inflation increases. Inflation risk is mitigated by holding index-linked government bonds and corporate b onds 
and, in the UK, inflation derivatives. At 31 March 2017, £282 mi llion (2016 – £270 million) of the benefit obligation was match ed by 
qualifying insurance policies that also mitigate longevity risk. The plans also maintain a portfolio of return-seeking investme nts, 
principally in the form of equities and property. 
d) Funding of the plans 
As required by local regulations, actuarial valuations of the US pension plans are carried out each year and those of the UK pe nsion 
plans are carried out at least every three years. During the year, the actuarial valuation at 31 March 2016 of the Tate & Lyle Group 
Pension Scheme (Scheme) was concluded with core funding contri butions remaining at £12 million per year. The secured funding 
account established under the previous actuar ial valuation will continue to receive su pplementary contributions of £6 million per 
year until March 2023, payable to the truste es on certain triggering events such as under performance of the Scheme’s investmen ts 
or a deterioration in the strength of the Group’s financial covenant. The Group will continue to fund the UK plan administratio n costs. 
During the year the Amylum UK Pension Scheme was formally wound up. This followed the final settlement of £2 million in the pri or 
year included in discontinued operations. 
During the year ending 31 March 2018, the Group expects to contribute approximately £39 million to its defined benefit pension plans 
and to pay approximately £5 million in relation to retirement medical benefits.

31. Share-based payments 
The Company operates share-based incentive arrangements for the executive directors, senior executives and other eligible 
employees under which awards and options are granted over the Company’s ordinary shares. All of the arrangements under which 
awards and options were outstanding during the 2017 and 2016 fina ncial years are classified as equity-settled. During the year, the 
compensation expense recognised in profit or loss in respect of share-based incentives was £21 million (2016 – £9 million). The 
following arrangements existed during the period:  
a) Performance Share Plan 
The Group’s principal ongoing share-based incentive arrangement is the Performance Share Plan (PSP). Participation in the PSP i s 
restricted to the executive directors and other senior executives. Awards made under the PSP normally vest provided the partici pant 
remains in the Group’s employment until the end of the perfor mance period, and subject to the satisfaction of performance 
conditions.  
The conditions applicable to PSP awards made from 1 April 2016 relate to the achievement of the Group adjusted return on capita l 
employed (ROCE) and adjusted profit targets. Up to 50% of ea ch award vests dependent on the Group’s adjusted ROCE from 
continuing operations reaching specified levels at the end of th e performance period. Up to 25% of each award vests dependent o n 
the compound annual growth in the Group’s adju sted profit before tax with the remainin g 25% from compound annual growth of the 
Speciality Food Ingredients business adjusted operating profit (excluding SPLENDA
®
 Sucralose). 
The conditions applicable to PSP awards made prior to 31 March 2016 relate to the achievement of earnings per share (EPS) and 
return on capital employed (ROCE) targets. Up to 50% of each award vests dependent on the co mpound annual growth rate of the 
Group’s adjusted diluted EPS from continuing operations reaching specified levels over the performance period. Up to 50% of eac h 
award vests dependent on the Group’s adjusted ROCE from continuing operations reaching specified levels at the end of the 
performance period.  
The performance period is the period of th ree financial years beginning with the financial year in which the award is granted.  
b) Group Bonus Plan – deferred element  
Bonuses earned under the Group Bonus Plan are normally paid in cash up to 100% of the base salary of the participating executiv e. 
Any excess above 100% of base salary is paid in the form of deferred shares that are released after two years subject to the 
executive remaining in the Group’s employment. During the vesting period, payments in lieu of dividends are made in relation to the 
deferred shares.  
c) Sharesave Plan  
Options are granted from time to time under the Company’s Shares ave Plan, which is open to all employees in the UK. It offers 
eligible employees the option to buy shares in the Company after a period of three or five years funded from the proceeds of a 
savings contract to which they contribute on a monthly basis. The exercise price reflects a discount to market value of up to 2 0%. 
d) Restricted Share Awards  
The Company has made Restricted Share Awards to a number of el igible employees. Awards made normally vest provided the 
participant remains in the Group’s employment during the performance period and other conditions, specific to the individual 
awards, are met.

The difference between the carrying value and the discou nted present value was not material in either year. 
Contingent liabilities  
Passaic River  
The Group remains subject to a legal case arising from the noti fication in 2007 by the U.S. En vironmental Protection Agency 
(‘USEPA’) that Tate & Lyle, along with approximately 70+ others, is a potentially responsible party (‘PRP’) for a 17 mile secti on of the 
northern New Jersey Passaic River, a major ‘Superfund’ site. In March 2016, the USEPA issued its Record of Decision (‘ROD’) on the 
likely cost for the remediation of the lower eight mile section of the river (the most contaminated). Whilst Tate & Lyle will c ontinue to 
vigorously defend itself in this matter, in light of the publication of the ROD, the Group took an exceptional charge of £6 mil lion in the 
year ended 31 March 2016. The Group continues to be unable to estimate a reasonably possible range of loss in respect of the 
remaining nine mile section of the river and therefore has not recognised a provision in this regard.  
Other claims  
The Group is subject to claims and litigation generally arising in the ordinary course of its business, some of which are for 
substantial amounts. All such actions are st renuously defended but provision is made for liabilities that are considered likely to  
arise on the basis of current information and legal advice. While there is always uncertainty as to the outcome of any claim or 
litigation, it is not expected that claims and litigation existing at 31 March 2017 will have a material adverse effect on the Group’s 
financial position.

On 1 June 2016, the Group completed the sale of its corn wet mill in Casablanca, Morocco to ADM, receiving gross cash proceeds of 
£4 million, £3 million net after cash disposed. The investment had previously been classified as held for sale at 31 March 2016 . The 
Group recognised an operating exceptional impairment charge of £4 million in the year ended 31 March 2016, aligning book value 
with expected proceeds after allowing for working capital and cash extracted from the business before completion. In the curren t 
financial year, the Group recognised a £1 million exceptional gain resulting from the recycling of cumulative foreign exchange 
translation gains from reserves to the income statement upon disposal of the subsidiary. 
During the year ended 31 March 2016, the Group recognised an exceptional tax charge of £5 million within discontinued operation s 
in respect of historical tax matters in Morocco. 
Completion of Howbetter disposal 
On 23 December 2016, the Group completed the disposal of Jian gsu Tate & Lyle Howbetter Food Co., Ltd, its Food Systems 
subsidiary in China, recognising a £7 million operating exceptio nal charge (within other expenses) in respect of impairing and 
deconsolidating the entity prior to disposal, and associated costs (see Note 7). 
Eaststarch re-alignment  
Update in current financial year 
During the year ended 31 March 2017, the Group concluded its pu rchase price allocation in respect of the acquisition of the 
remaining 50% of the plant in Slovakia, Amylum Slovakia s.r.o. (subsequently renamed Tate & Lyle Boleraz s.r.o.). The Group 
recognised a £1 million increase to the provisional goodwill that was recognised at 31 March 2016 following a re-measurement of 
net assets acquired. 
Eaststarch re-alignment made during the year ended 31 March 2016  
On 31 October 2015, the Group completed the re-alignment of its Eaststarch joint venture with ADM. Under the re-alignment, the 
Group disposed of the predominantly bulk ingredients plants in Bulgaria, Turkey and Hungary and acquired the remaining 50% 
interest in the more speciality food ingredients focused plant in Slovakia not already owned by the Group. The Group received n et 
cash consideration of £173 million (€240 million) at closing.  
Although the cash consideration was received as a single net am ount, IFRS required this consideration to be grossed-up to 
determine the cash effectively paid to acquire the 50% interest in the Slovakia business and the cash received for the disposal of  
the Group’s interests in the plants in Bulgaria, Turkey and Hungary. In addition, as the acquisition of the Slovakian business was a 
step acquisition, the Group’s existing interest in this plant was required to be re-measured to its fair value, which was then included 
as a component of the consideration paid for the acquisition. This gross-up of the net cash consideration was done at fair valu e.  
The result was that consideration of £112 mi llion (€156 million) was deemed to be paid for the acquired business, comprising  
£56 million (€78 million) of cash consideration and £56 million (€78 million) for the fair value of the Group’s existing interest in 
Slovakia. Each of the components of the Eaststarch re-alignment, comprising the acquisition accounting for the Slovakia busines s, 
the gain on re-measurement of the Group’s existing interest in that plant and the disposal of the plants in Bulgaria, Turkey an d 
Hungary, are set out on pages 170 and 171.

34. Acquisitions and disposals continued 
Acquisition of Amylum Slovakia s.r.o.  
As noted on the previous page, as part of the re-alignment of the Eaststarch joint venture, the Group acquired the remaining 50 %  
of the more speciality focused plant in Slovakia, Amylum Slovakia s.r.o., and subsequently renamed it Tate & Lyle Boleraz s.r.o . 
Total consideration in respect of the Slovakian acquisition was £115 million. The fair value of identifiable net assets acquire d was  
£80 million, resulting in provisional goodwill as at 31 March 2016 of £35 million (which was not deductible for tax purposes).  
The plant in Slovakia provides a solid base from which to grow the Group’s Speciality Food Ingredients business in Europe and an 
opportunity to increase production at the plant over time. Prov isional goodwill of £35 million primarily represented the premiu m paid 
to acquire an established business with a proven workforce and growth potential in the speciality food ingredients market.  
At the same time, two long-term distributi on agreements were also put in place under which the Group distributes crystalline 
fructose, a speciality sweetener, produced by ADM in Turkey an d ADM acts as exclusive distributor for bulk ingredients, produce d in 
the Group’s Slovakia and Netherlands facilities. 
The acquired business in Slovakia contributed sales of £52 million and an operating profit of £2 million for the period from 
acquisition on 31 October 2015 until the end of the 2016 financia l year (including the amortisation of acquired intangibles rec ognised 
from the acquisition). Had the business been acquired at the beginning of the 2016 financial year, it would have contributed sa les of 
£130 million and an operating profit of £5 million in the 2016 financial year. Acquisition related costs were recognised as part of the 
overall Eaststarch re-alignment transaction costs (within exceptiona l items) and in cash flows from operating activities in the 
consolidated statement of cash flows.

STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS USEFUL INFORMATION
www.tateandlyle.com 177 Independent Auditors’ Report to the Members of Tate & Lyle PLC 
178 Tate & Lyle PLC Annual Report 2017 
Report on the Parent Company 
financial statements 
Our opinion 
In our opinion, Tate & Lyle PLC’s Parent 
Company financial statements (the ‘financial 
statements’): 
• give a true and fair view of the state of the 
Parent Company’s affairs as at 31 March 
2017; 
• have been properly prepared in accordance 
with United Kingdom Generally Accepted 
Accounting Practice; and 
• have been prepared in accordance with the 
requirements of the Companies Act 2006. 
What we have audited 
The financial statements, included within the 
Annual Report, comprise: 
• the Parent Company Balance Sheet as at  
31 March 2017; 
• the Parent Company Statement of Changes 
in Equity for the year then ended; and 
• the notes to the financial statements, which 
include a summary of significant accounting 
policies and other explanatory information. 
Certain required disclosures have been presented 
elsewhere in the Annual Report, rather than in the 
notes to the financial statements. These are 
cross-referenced from the financial statements 
and are identified as audited. 
The financial reporting framework that has 
been applied in the preparation of the financial 
statements is United Kingdom Accounting 
Standards, comprising FRS 101 ‘Reduced 
Disclosure Framework’, and applicable law 
(United Kingdom Generally Accepted 
Accounting Practice). 
Other required reporting 
Consistency of other information 
and compliance with applicable 
requirements 
Companies Act 2006 opinion 
In our opinion, based on the work undertaken in 
the course of the audit: 
• the information given in the Strategic Report 
and the Directors’ Report for the financial 
year for which the financial statements are 
prepared is consistent with the financial 
statements; and 
• the Strategic Report and the Directors’ 
Report have been prepared in accordance 
with applicable legal requirements. 
In addition, in light of the knowledge and 
understanding of the Company and its 
environment obtained in the course of the audit, 
we are required to report if we have identified 
any material misstatements in the Strategic 
Report and the Directors’ Report. We have 
nothing to report in this respect. 
ISAs (UK & Ireland) reporting 
Under International Standards on Auditing (UK 
and Ireland) (‘ISAs (UK & Ireland)’) we are 
required to report to you if, in our opinion, 
information in the Annual Report is: 
• materially inconsistent with the information 
in the audited financial statements; or 
• apparently materially incorrect based on, or 
materially inconsistent with, our knowledge 
of the Parent Company acquired in the 
course of performing our audit; or 
• otherwise misleading. 
We have no exceptions to report arising from 
this responsibility. 
Adequacy of accounting records 
and information and explanations 
received 
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required 
to report to you if, in our opinion: 
• we have not received all the information and 
explanations we require for our audit; or 
• adequate accounting records have not been 
kept by the Parent Company, or returns 
adequate for our audit have not been 
received from branches not visited by us; or 
• the financial statements and the part of the 
Directors’ Remuneration Report to be 
audited are not in agreement with the 
accounting records and returns. 
We have no exceptions to report arising from 
this responsibility. 
Directors’ remuneration 
Directors’ Remuneration Report – 
Companies Act 2006 opinion 
In our opinion, the part of the Directors’ 
Remuneration Report to be audited has been 
properly prepared in accordance with the 
Companies Act 2006. 
Other Companies Act 2006 reporting 
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required 
to report to you if, in our opinion, certain 
disclosures of Directors’ remuneration 
specified by law are not made. We have no 
exceptions to report arising from this 
responsibility. 
Responsibilities for the financial 
statements and the audit 
Our responsibilities and those of 
the Directors 
As explained more fully in the Directors’ 
Statement of Responsibilities set out on  
page 99, the Directors are responsible for  
the preparation of the financial statements  
and for being satisfied that they give a true  
and fair view. 
Our responsibility is to audit and express an 
opinion on the financial statements in 
accordance with applicable law and ISAs (UK & 
Ireland). Those standards require us to comply 
with the Auditing Practices Board’s Ethical 
Standards for Auditors. 
This report, including the opinions, has been 
prepared for and only for the Parent Company’s 
members as a body in accordance with Chapter 
3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006 and for 
no other purpose. We do not, in giving these 
opinions, accept or assume responsibility for 
any other purpose or to any other person to 
whom this report is shown or into whose hands 
it may come save where expressly agreed by 
our prior consent in writing. 
What an audit of financial 
statements involves 
We conducted our audit in accordance with 
ISAs (UK & Ireland). An audit involves obtaining 
evidence about the amounts and disclosures in 
the financial statements sufficient to give 
reasonable assurance that the financial 
statements are free from material 
misstatement, whether caused by fraud or 
error. This includes an assessment of:  
• whether the accounting policies are 
appropriate to the Parent Company’s 
circumstances and have been consistently 
applied and adequately disclosed;  
• the reasonableness of significant accounting 
estimates made by the Directors; and  
• the overall presentation of the financial 
statements.  
We primarily focus our work in these areas  
by assessing the Directors’ judgements  
against available evidence, forming our own 
judgements, and evaluating the disclosures in 
the financial statements. 
We test and examine information, using 
sampling and other auditing techniques, to the 
extent we consider necessary to provide a 
reasonable basis for us to draw conclusions. 
We obtain audit evidence through testing the 
effectiveness of controls, substantive 
procedures or a combination of both.  
In addition, we read all the financial and  
non-financial information in the Annual Report 
to identify material inconsistencies with the 
audited financial statements and to identify any 
information that is apparently materially 
incorrect based on, or materially inconsistent 
with, the knowledge acquired by us in the 
course of performing the audit. If we become 
aware of any apparent material misstatements 
or inconsistencies we consider the implications 
for our report. With respect to the Strategic 
Report and Directors’ Report, we consider 
whether those reports include the disclosures 
required by applicable legal requirements. 
Other matter 
We have reported separately on the Group 
financial statements of Tate & Lyle PLC for the 
year ended 31 March 2017.

  www.tateandlyle.com 181 
1. Principal accounting policies 
Basis of preparation  
Tate & Lyle PLC (the Company) is a public limited company 
incorporated in the United Kingdom and registered in England. 
The Company’s ordinary shares are listed on the London Stock 
Exchange.  
The Company’s financial statements are prepared under the 
historical cost convention in accordance with Financial 
Reporting Standard 101 ‘Reduced Disclosure Framework’ (‘FRS 
101’) and with UK accounting presentation as at 31 March 2017, 
with comparative figures as at 31 March 2016.  
For the reasons set out on page 111, the Company’s financial 
statements are prepared on a going concern basis.  
As permitted by Section 408 of the Companies Act 2006, the 
Company’s profit and loss account is not presented in these 
financial statements. Profit and loss account disclosures are 
presented in Note 13. 
The results of the Company are included in the preceding Group 
financial statements.  
The following exemptions from the requirements of IFRS have 
been applied in the preparation of these financial statements, in 
accordance with FRS 101:  
• the requirements of IAS 7 Statement of Cash Flows  
• the requirements of paragraph 17 and 18(a) of IAS 24 Related 
Party Disclosures  
• the requirements in IAS 24 Related Party Disclosures to 
disclose related party transactions entered into between two 
or more members of a group, provided that any subsidiary 
which is a party to the transaction is wholly owned by such a 
member  
• the requirement in paragraph 38 of IAS 1 Presentation of 
Financial Statements to present comparative information in 
respect of paragraph 79(a)(iv) of IAS 1  
• the requirements of IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: 
Disclosures  
• the requirements of paragraphs 30 and 31 of IAS 8 Accounting 
Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors  
• the requirements of IFRS 2 Share Based Payments  
• the requirements of paragraphs 91 to 99 of IFRS 13 Fair Value 
Measurement  
• the requirements of paragraphs 10(d) (statement of cash 
flows), 10(f) (statement of financial position as at the 
beginning of the proceeding period when an entity applies an 
accounting policy retrospectively), 38(A to D) (comparative 
information), 40(A to D) (presentation of third balance sheet), 
111 (statement of cash flows) and 134 to 136 (capital 
management) of IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements. 
The Company intends to maintain these disclosure exemptions 
in future years.  
Judgements and key sources of uncertainty  
Estimating fair value for share-based transactions requires 
determination of the most appropriate valuation model  
which depends on the terms and conditions of the grant.  
This estimation also requires determination of the most 
appropriate inputs to the valuation model.  
Tangible fixed assets  
Tangible fixed assets are stated at historical cost less 
accumulated depreciation and impairment. Historical cost 
includes expenditure that is directly attributable to the 
acquisition of the items. Subsequent costs are included in the 
asset’s carrying amount or recognised as a separate asset, as 
appropriate, only when it is probable that future economic 
benefits associated with the expenditure will flow to the Group 
and the cost of the item can be measured reliably. All repairs 
and maintenance expenditures are charged to the income 
statement during the period in which they are incurred.  
Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method to 
allocate the cost of each asset to its residual value over its 
useful economic life.  
Residual values and useful lives are reviewed at each  
period-end date and adjusted as appropriate, with any resulting 
changes recognised in the income statement prospectively.  
Gains and losses on disposals are determined by comparing the 
disposal proceeds with the carrying amount and are included in 
the income statement.  
Intangible assets  
Other intangible assets comprise certain computer software 
and the global IS/IT system. Costs incurred on the development, 
design and testing of the software and systems are capitalised 
only when their technical feasibility has been proven. Costs 
associated with maintenance are charged to the income 
statement in the period in which they are incurred. Other 
intangible assets are amortised on a straight-line basis over the 
periods of their expected benefit to the Company, which are in 
the range of three to seven years.  
Investments  
Subsidiaries are all entities over which the Company has 
control. The Company controls an entity when it is exposed to,  
or has rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the 
entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its 
power over the entity.  
An associate is an entity over which the Company has significant 
influence. Significant influence is the power to participate in 
financial and operating policy decisions but not to control or 
jointly control them.  
Investments in subsidiary undertakings and in associates 
represent interests that are directly owned by the Company and 
are stated at cost less amounts written-off for any permanent 
diminution in value.  
Amounts owed by or to subsidiary undertakings  
Amounts owed by or to subsidiary undertakings are stated at 
amortised cost using the effective interest method. Amounts 
owed by subsidiary undertakings are written off where deemed 
unrecoverable.

1. Principal accounting policies continued 
Leases  
Operating lease payments are charged to the profit and loss 
account on a straight-line basis over the lease term.  
Retirement benefits  
The Company participates in a defined benefit pension scheme 
in which certain of its subsidiaries also participate. The 
Company, which is not the principa l employer, cannot identify its 
share of the underlying assets and liabilities of the scheme. 
Accordingly, as permitted by IAS 19 Employee Benefits, the 
Company accounts for the scheme as a defined contribution 
scheme and charges its contributions to the scheme to the 
profit and loss account in the periods in which they fall due.  
Deferred tax  
Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all temporary 
differences that have originated but which have not reversed at 
the balance sheet date where transactions or events have 
occurred at that date that will result in an obligation to pay 
more, or a right to pay less, or to receive more tax. Deferred tax 
assets are recognised to the extent that they are regarded as 
recoverable. Assets are regarded as recoverable when it is 
regarded as more likely than not there will be suitable taxable 
profits from which the future reversal of the underlying timing 
differences can be deducted. 
Foreign currency translation  
Transactions denominated in foreign currencies are translated 
into pounds sterling at the exchan ge rate ruling on the date of 
the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in 
foreign currencies are retranslated into pounds sterling at the 
exchange rate ruling on the balance sheet date. Currency 
translation differences are credited or charged to the profit and 
loss account. Non-monetary assets denominated in foreign 
currencies and carried at historic al cost are translated using the 
exchange rate ruling on the date of transaction.  
Share-based payments  
As described in Note 31 to the consolidated financial 
statements, the Company operates share-based incentive plans 
under which it grants awards over its ordinary shares to its own 
employees and to those of its subsidiary undertakings. All of the 
awards granted under the existing plans are classified as 
equity-settled awards.  
For awards granted to its own employees, the Company 
recognises an expense that is based on the fair value of the 
awards measured at the grant date using the Black-Scholes 
option pricing formula. Fair value reflects any market 
performance conditions and all non-vesting conditions. 
Adjustments are made to the compensation expense to reflect 
actual and expected forfeitures due to failure to satisfy service 
conditions or non-market performance conditions. Generally, 
the expense is recognised in the profit and loss account on a 
straight-line basis over the vesting period and a corresponding 
credit is recognised in the profit and loss account reserve. For 
awards granted to employees of its subsidiary undertakings, the 
Company recognises a capital contribution to the subsidiary and 
a corresponding credit to equity calculated on the same basis as 
the expense that it recognises for awards to its own employees.  
Provisions  
Provisions are recognised when the Company has a present 
obligation as a result of a past event, it is probable that a 
transfer of economic benefits will be required to settle the 
obligation, and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of 
the obligation.  
Guarantees  
From time to time, the Company provides guarantees to third 
parties in respect of the indebtedness of its subsidiary 
undertakings and joint ventures. The Directors consider these 
guarantees to be insurance arrangements and, therefore, the 
Company recognises a liability in respect of such guarantees 
only in the event that it becomes probable that the guarantee 
will be called upon and the Company will be required to make a 
payment to the third party. Commitments in respect of 
retirement benefit obligations are detailed in Note 14.  
Own shares  
Own shares represent the Company’s ordinary shares that are 
held by the Company in treasury or by a sponsored Employee 
Benefit Trust that are used to satisfy awards made under the 
Company’s share-based incentive plans. When own shares are 
acquired, the cost of purchase in the market is deducted from 
the profit and loss account reserve. Gains or losses on the 
subsequent transfer or sale of own shares are also recognised 
in the profit and loss account reserve.  
Dividends  
Dividends on the Company’s ordinary shares are recognised 
when they have been appropriately authorised and are no longer 
at the Company’s discretion. Accordingly, interim dividends are 
recognised when they are paid and final dividends are 
recognised when they are declared following approval by 
shareholders at the Company’s AGM. Dividends are recognised 
as an appropriation of shareholders’ funds. Details of dividends 
paid and proposed are set out in Note 12.  
Dividend income received from subsidiary companies is 
recognised when the right to receive the payment is established.

14. Employee benefits 
Plan information 
The Company participates in a defined benefit plan together with another subsidiary company, Tate & Lyle Industries Ltd. Paymen ts 
made by contributing companies principally comprise funding contributions agreed with the trustees that are determined to ensur e 
that appropriate funding levels are maintained and funding defici ts are eliminated over a reasonable period of time. The plan is 
closed to new entrants and future accruals. The Company has 342 pensioners and deferred pensioners out of a total membership of 
circa 5,800 (excluding dependent beneficiaries).  
The Company also operates a defined contribution pension plan. Contributions payable by the Company to the plan during the year 
amounted to £2 million (2016 – £1 million).  
The Company has provided a full liability guarantee in respect of the pension obligations of Tate & Lyle Industries Ltd, the ot her 
participating employer. Whilst there is no agreed allocation of deficit or surplu s, the trustees have discretion to distribute any 
surplus on winding up as they consider appropriate, after increa se of benefits consistent with Inland Revenue Limits which appl ied 
up to 5 April 2006. 
Funding commitments of the plan  
As required by UK regulations, actuarial valuations are carried out at least every th ree years. Core funding contributions are  
£12 million per annum (2016 – £12 million). In addition, supplementary contributions of £6 million (2016 – £6 million) will be made 
into a secured funding account until March 2023. The deficit or surplus in the plan impacts the future contributions which are 
determined with reference to the triennial actuarial valuations.  
For further details on the defined benefit plan see Note 30 in the consolidated financial statements.

Calculation of changes in constant currency 
Where changes in constant currency are presented in this statement, they are calculated by retranslating current year results a t 
prior year exchange rates. This represents a change to the methodology applied in previous years, which involved retranslating prior 
year results at current year exchange rates. This change, which has not had a material impact, has been made to align with how the 
majority of external stakeholders view constant currency perfor mance comparisons. The following tables provide reconciliation 
between 2017 performance at actual exchange rates and at constant currency exchange rates. Absolute numbers presented in the 
tables are rounded for presentational purposes, whereas the growth percentages are calculated on unrounded numbers.

Electronic communications
Shareholder documents are only sent in paper format to shareholders who have 
elected to receive documents in this way. This approach enables the Company to 
reduce printing and distribution costs and the impact of the documents on 
the environment.
Shareholders who wish to receive email notification should register online at  
www.shareview.co.uk, using their shareholder reference number that is on either 
their share certificate or other correspondence.
Dividend payments
Dividend reinvestment plan
The Company operates a Dividend Reinvestment Plan (DRIP) which enables 
shareholders to use their cash dividend to buy additional shares in Tate & Lyle PLC. 
Further information can be obtained from Equiniti.
Direct into your bank account
We encourage shareholders to have their dividends paid directly into their bank or 
building society account; dividend confirmations are then mailed to shareholders 
separately. This method avoids the risk of dividend cheques being delayed or lost in 
the post. If you live outside the UK, Equiniti also offers an overseas payment service 
whereby your dividend is converted into your local currency. Further information on 
mandating your dividend payments and the overseas payment service can be 
obtained from Equiniti.
Beware of share fraud
Shareholders should be very wary of any unsolicited calls or correspondence offering 
to buy or sell shares at a discounted price. These calls are typically from fraudsters 
operating ‘boiler rooms’. Boiler rooms use increasingly sophisticated means to 
approach investors and often leave their victims out of pocket. If you are concerned 
that you may have been targeted by fraudsters please contact the Financial Conduct 
Authority (FCA) Consumer Helpline on 0800 111 6768.
