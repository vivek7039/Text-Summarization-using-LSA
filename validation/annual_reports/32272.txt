Findel plc 
Annual report and accounts 2017
Chairman’s Statement I Strategic Report
Dear Shareholder,
Welcome to our 2017 Annual Report 
and Accounts.
Since joining the Group in January 2017, 
I have spent time getting to know our 
two businesses, Express Gifts and Findel 
Education. Both have leading positions 
in their respective markets and have 
strategies to build on the progress of 
recent years, evolving their operating 
models to cater for their customers’ 
future demands and ways of shopping. 
I’m excited about the opportunity for 
sustainable growth in a marketplace 
for value‑ conscious customers who are 
rapidly moving their purchases online, 
although there is a significant amount of 
further work required to achieve that goal.
The new executive management team 
that we announced at the start of April 
2017, led by Phil Maudsley, have a wealth 
of relevant experience that will be used to 
deliver this growth.
We have seen good progress in the last 
financial year, with Express Gifts moving 
its customer recruitment programme 
to be all‑ year‑ round through a focus on 
great‑value products and TV advertising. 
A 17% increase in its customer base 
to 1.6m indicates the success of that 
approach, as this business continues 
to drive the growth of the Group as a 
whole. Findel Education completed 
the consolidation of its warehousing 
operations to improve future profitability 
with no disruption to its supply chain. 
Both businesses have increased their 
capital expenditure on developing 
digital solutions to make it easier and 
more compelling for our customers 
to shop with us.
The Group has, however, produced an 
outturn for the year that has once again 
been below the expectations set internally 
and externally at the start of the year. 
It has also seen a high level and incidence 
of individually significant items. We have 
therefore introduced additional resource 
into the relevant areas to improve upon 
the setting and delivery of achievable 
targets for future years.
Financial performance
Revenue^ for the Group grew by 10.2% 
in the year on a like‑ for‑ like basis* 
(11.3% on a reported basis for the 
53‑ week period), with adjusted profit 
before tax^* falling to £22.2m (2015/16: 
£24.8m). The Group incurred individually 
significant charges totalling £82.2m, 
primarily relating to the cost of refunding 
customers for their purchase of financial 
services products from us in the past, 
onerous leases, impairment of intangible 
assets and additional provisions from the 
adoption of our new bad debt provisioning 
model. As such, the loss before tax for 
the year was £59.4m. It should be noted 
that the vast majority of the individually 
significant items recorded in the year do 
not lead to any incremental or accelerated 
cash outflows.
Core net debt* fell by £4.8m to £80.8m, 
within which the element not relating 
to customer receivables fell to just 
£22.6m or 0.6x adjusted EBITDA* 
(2015/16: 0.8x). Debt supporting the 
customer receivables* increased to 
£200.8m (2015/16: £181.6m) of which the 
expanded securitisation facility provided 
£142.5m (2015/16: £128.9m).
Chairman’s Statement
“ I’m excited about the opportunity for sustainable 
growth in a marketplace for value‑ conscious 
customers who are rapidly moving their 
purchases online.”

Strategic Report I Chairman’s Statement
Dividends
The Board continues to focus on 
strengthening the financial position of 
each of the operating subsidiaries’ balance 
sheets and that of the parent company. 
As such, the Company does not have 
plans to reinstate dividend payments 
at this stage.
Management and Board
I joined the Board in January 2017 as 
Chairman, initially in an executive capacity 
before reverting to a more conventional 
non‑ executive capacity in April 2017. Phil 
Maudsley was appointed as CEO at that 
time, with Paul Kendrick stepping up 
to replace Phil as managing director of 
Express Gifts. Stuart Caldwell became the 
acting CFO, with Chris Mahady remaining 
as managing director of Findel Education.
David Sugden and Tim Kowalski left Findel 
in 2017 having steered the Group over 
the last seven and six years respectively. 
They joined at a time when the Group 
had a diverse composition and was over‑ indebted, but they left it well funded and 
simplified for the medium term. We wish 
them both well for the future.
Employees
I have met many of our employees since 
joining in January and have been struck 
by their enthusiasm for our businesses 
and their shared belief in modernising 
our operating models to make it easier 
and more compelling for our customers 
to shop with us. On behalf of the Board, 
I would like to thank all of our employees 
for their continued hard work.
Current trading
We have made an encouraging start to 
the year, with Express Gifts trading in 
line with expectations, although Findel 
Education has seen weaker demand in 
recent weeks than anticipated. The early 
weeks of our financial year are always 
relatively quiet trading periods for our 
businesses. A fuller update on trading will 
be given at our AGM which will be held at 
the end of August.
Outlook
The investment in growing the Express 
Gifts customer base has provided a strong 
foundation for the new financial year, 
and we expect to see the initial benefits 
coming through towards the second half 
of the year. Our plans to improve the 
profitability of Findel Education will start 
to take shape during the coming year.
The impact of higher input costs from the 
depreciation in Sterling since the Brexit 
referendum will feed its way through 
the sector in the coming months. We 
are working hard with our suppliers and 
continue to review our internal cost‑ base 
to maintain Express Gifts’ proposition 
as a leading online value retailer. The 
general level of uncertainty arising from 
recent events and the start of the Brexit 
process, inevitably, is impacting consumer 
confidence. However, any weakening in 
this confidence would be expected to 
lead to value retailers such as Express 
Gifts gaining market share. Therefore, 
we remain confident in the opportunities 
for growth in our business.

online, with the catalogue in many cases 
forming part of the browsing journey. We 
are making that process seamless for 
customers by investing to ensure that we 
always have online channels that meet 
their expectations.
We also have to be alert to changing 
patterns of use and expectation of service 
levels. 63% of Express Gifts’ customers 
ordered online last year. However, in 
Spring this year we have seen over 80% 
of our new customers that we have 
recruited placing their first orders online. 
At some point in the future we will see 
this figure inevitably approaching 100%. 
We are planning now for the investment 
and transformation required to keep pace 
with this digital evolution.
Maximising our potential
Broadly speaking, our businesses have 
operated on a standalone basis over the 
last few years, with little focus on Group 
synergies. This was logical at a time when 
the smaller business units may have 
been under consideration for disposal. 
However, with the Group structure now 
established, we can see several areas 
going forward where we can better 
utilise our resources to drive value and 
efficiency. We are already working on 
two areas of opportunity. Firstly, we have 
moved our small plc‑ team from Hyde 
(where Findel Education is headquartered) 
to Accrington (where Express Gifts is 
based). By doing this, we can share the 
plc finance and business support functions 
with those of Express Gifts to share skills 
and make efficiency savings. Secondly, 
we are encouraging Findel Education to 
make greater use of our own Far East 
sourcing offices, which have increasingly 
moved away from their Hong Kong 
heritage in favour of the Chinese industrial 
Recent years have seen Findel make 
significant progress in restructuring and 
simplifying the Group. In Express Gifts 
and Findel Education we now have two 
core businesses that we believe have 
the potential to generate significant 
incremental shareholder value over the 
coming years. My challenge as CEO is 
to build on the good work of the last few 
years and put in place the strategies and 
actions to unlock that potential, whilst 
eliminating the individually significant 
charges and legacy cash outflows that 
have undermined our recent performance.
Customers are at the heart of our 
businesses
We must continue to put the customer in 
both businesses at the heart of everything 
we do, by listening to customers and 
through delivering excellent product 
choice and quality at every‑ day good 
value.
To better improve our offer, we are 
constantly seeking to understand the 
following from our customers:
• Why do they shop with us rather than 
our competitors and vice versa?
• How can we improve their shopping 
experience to convince them to come 
back to us in future?
• How can we encourage them to spend 
a greater proportion of their wallet 
with us?
Our business models are adapting to 
cater for a marketplace that is increasingly 
moving online. The paper catalogues 
used by both businesses will remain a 
key element of our marketing for some 
time, as that’s what our customers tell 
us that they want. However, we also 
know that increasingly they want to shop 
areas where goods are manufactured. 
By revisiting that opportunity, Findel 
Education has identified a number of 
new suppliers who can provide better 
quality products at significantly lower 
prices, allowing us to pass savings onto 
our customers whilst protecting margins. 
They have also identified opportunities 
where they could buy from the same 
sources as Express Gifts, so both can gain 
bulk discounts. We will explore further 
ideas over the coming months in order 
to maximise the efficiencies of our two 
businesses.
Whilst the future opportunities look 
exciting and the rate of customer 
growth at Express Gifts remains strong, 
we cannot escape the fact that our 
financial performance during FY17 was 
disappointing and below the expectations 
that we set ourselves. However, we 
have addressed a number of judgemental 
issues in these results and, whilst the 
increased provisions for past financial 
services matters are necessary, it is right 
that we address these issues now for the 
benefit of our customers.
Leadership
As Ian has indicated in his Chairman’s 
Statement, I have a new executive 
leadership team in place. It comprises 
the two divisional managing directors, 
Paul Kendrick of Express Gifts and 
Chris Mahady of Findel Education, along 
with our acting CFO, Stuart Caldwell, 
and our Company Secretary, Mark 
Ashcroft. Together, we are focused on 
sustainable, improved profit performance 
in both businesses leading to improved 
shareholder returns.
Chief Executive’s Review
“ The last year has seen further building blocks 
put in place to enable the Group to deliver on 
its medium‑ term plans. While the reported 
performance was disappointing, the new 
leadership structure we now have in place will 
support the delivery of future growth.”

Annual report and accounts 2017
Chief Executive’s Review I Strategic Report
Brexit
In line with the wider retail sector, the 
decision to leave the European Union has 
had an impact on import costs. Express 
Gifts’ goods are generally manufactured 
outside the UK, so exposing us to the 
fluctuations in Sterling at some point in 
the supply chain. Where that exposure 
is seen directly, namely where we 
buy in US$ or euros which represents 
around a third of total purchases, we are 
well‑placed with hedging policies in place 
to cover planned purchases on a rolling 
12‑ month basis. That provides time for 
us to adapt our supply chain, so mitigating 
the impact upon our customers. Indirect 
exposures are managed similarly through 
discussion with suppliers and reviewing 
our internal processes.
All of Express Gifts’ customers are 
based in the UK, and Findel Education’s 
international customers buy in Sterling.
Performance in FY17
Express Gifts saw continued progress in 
FY17, particularly in acquiring a significant 
number of new customers in a cost‑ effective way and retaining more of its 
established customers. The use of TV and 
social media in our recruitment approach 
will inevitably attract a broader audience 
than just our target customer, but the 
proportion of new customers taking credit 
terms is in line with our expectations. 
The new Philippines‑ based operation 
increased our capacity to handle inbound 
enquiries, but we also made substantial 
improvements to its online systems to 
make it easier for customers to trade with 
us and handle any queries they may have 
without the need to physically contact us. 
The business navigated through the sharp 
changes to exchange rates in June 2016 
and made further improvements to the 
way we use our Far East sourcing office. 
However, the combination of increased 
investment in customer recruitment in Q4 
and requiring additional currency at lower 
than average rates to source goods to 
support it, impacted profit in the year by 
around £2.0m.
Findel Education continued to see 
challenging market conditions, with 
price competition for the commodity‑ based School brands being particularly 
intense and leading to a further loss in 
market share. It did, however, manage to 
regain lost customers for its Classroom 
and Specialist brands. Importantly, it 
completed its warehouse consolidation 
project on time, on budget and without 
disruption to customers.
The Group’s underlying cash generation 
remained strong, providing the basis for 
reinvestment into customer growth and 
system improvements.
However, the headline results fell short of 
our expectations, and were accompanied 
by a number of individually significant 
items that produced a significant net loss.
Focus for the year ahead
The building blocks put in place to enable 
the Group to deliver on its medium‑ term 
plans provide a strong platform for growth 
and I am very excited about the prospects 
for the Group as we enter the new 
financial year.
Looking ahead, we are confident in 
delivering against the respective strategies 
of both businesses. At Express Gifts 
we are focused on further growth in 
customers and share of wallet, while 
at Findel Education we will continue to 
address market share losses through 
better use of great value product, service 
and its new online channels. The Group 
will also increase its risk management 
resource, aimed at improving the 
resilience of the Group.

Express Gifts I Strategic Report
Express Gifts’ mission is to be the UK’s 
online retail destination of choice for 
value-conscious customers.
Express Gifts is an online and catalogue 
value retailer and trades through two 
key brands (Studio and Ace). Both 
brands offer customers a broad range 
of fashion, home and leisure items, 
toys and gifts at affordable prices. Its 
in‑house personalisation facility, its 
focus on every‑day value, combined with 
a flexible credit offer, creates a point 
of difference from other retailers. The 
business continues to use its traditional 
paper catalogues to engage customers 
but is increasingly transforming to be 
digitally led.
Customers
Express Gifts puts the customer at the 
heart of the business. Our core target 
customers are aged 25‑ 55, typically 
female, and are extremely value‑ conscious. 
They are busy people with lives centred 
around their families and our brands are 
a treat in their everyday lives.
During the year, 1.6m customers shopped 
with us, an increase of over 229,000 or 
17% compared to the previous year. This 
represents a key success for the business 
and gives us a strong platform for the 
coming year.
The size and loyalty of the customer base 
is the lifeblood of any online retailer. Our 
focus in FY17 was therefore to implement 
a strategy to significantly increase trading 
customers through a combination of extra 
recruitment and deployment of better 
online systems and processes to retain 
established customers.
“ 1.6 million customers 
shopped with us.  
An increase of over 
229,000 vs last year”
We increased marketing activity in the 
year, specifically TV and digital advertising, 
using a small number of exceptional value, 
‘showcase’ lines to attract new customers. 
This proved to be a successful approach 
with over 40% of new customers buying 
at least one of the ‘showcase’ products 
with their first order. We then saw the 
level of subsequent ordering and credit 
take‑ up in line with our expectations. 
This marketing activity also had a halo 
effect on the established customer base.
Given the success of this marketing 
approach through the year, we took the 
decision to invest in further marketing 
activity during February and March to 
continue customer growth momentum 
in 2017/18.
It typically takes around 18 months to 
recoup the investment in new customer 
recruitment due to a combination of the 
initial marketing cost itself, a relative 
high bad debt charge compared to an 
established customer, and a lower initial 
credit line from which we can earn 
financial services income. As a result, the 
increased recruitment activity, especially 
towards the end of the year, suppressed 
near‑ term profitability.
Historically, the business has been unable 
to invest in customer recruitment in 
the Spring season, but this provides an 
opportune period where good long‑ term 
returns can be achieved, and customers 
are more established by the time we get 
into our peak season later in the year. 
It also provides an opportunity to recruit 
customers with clothing offers. We intend 
to invest in customer recruitment all‑ year‑ round moving forwards.
Online development
Express Gifts is well‑ advanced in its 
journey from being a traditional catalogue 
business to a digitally‑ driven online value 
retailer. In the year, 63% of customers 
ordered online, up from 56% last year. 
However, for new customers, over 71% 
placed their first order online last year, 
with significant growth coming from 
the use of mobiles and tablets. This 
increases to over 93% for our youngest 
customers. All metrics have increased 
further this Spring. We therefore can 
foresee a time in the future where 
virtually all orders are made online and 
need to plan now for that.
In April 2016, Express Gifts moved its 
websites to IBM’s Commerce platform. 
This gives a robust market‑ leading 
solution from which to grow in the 
future, as well as introducing several 
new features to make it easier for our 
customers to shop and manage their 
account online. We also introduced 
Qubit, allowing us to tailor customers’ 
online experience, and implemented 
a number of online‑ only campaigns that 
helped to drive record sales in the weeks 
running up to Christmas.
To deliver these will require changes to:
• People: transform the culture and organisation to have the capability to operate in a customer focused, digital world…
• Process: remove the non-value tasks to enable us to focus on doing the right things well ‘efficient and effective’…
• Technology: continued investment in our systems – focus on modern, flexible and agile systems that can win in the
digital age, plus enable business efficiency
In the longer term (beyond 2020) new growth opportunities will need to be found:
• Identify and test these over the next 3 years 
• Should opportunities become available in the short term (such as a partnership with SDI), these will be progressed
providing they do not detract from the priorities above

Findel plc 
Annual report and accounts 2017
We know that being an online value 
retailer requires continuous improvement 
to make sure we keep meeting customer 
expectations in a rapidly‑ changing 
marketplace. Further developments to our 
online offering are being made ahead of 
the peak season in 2017.
Increasingly, online business brings with 
it risks around cyber security and resilience. 
By using a market‑ leading platform hosted 
externally, we are able to reduce these 
risks. More broadly, we are undergoing 
a review of the business’s resilience and 
have a project initiative to ensure our 
management of data is compliant with 
new regulations that come into force in 
May 2018.
Product development
Express Gifts has had a strong heritage 
in gifts, Christmas decorations, cards and 
accessories, but has moved over recent 
years to offer a broader appeal through 
clothing, homewares and electricals. 
It was encouraging to see clothing grow 
by 44%, but it still only represents 28% 
of total sales, presenting a significant 
opportunity for further growth as we 
recruit new customers year‑ round through 
our enhanced clothing offer. It also helps 
to increase the ordering frequency with 
our customer base. In the year, we 
highlighted our value through a range 
of ‘showcase’ products. These included:
• Tablet –£19.99
• Personalised Pencils
• Boyfriend Cardigan
The sharp fall in Sterling that followed the 
Brexit referendum presented a number of 
challenges to our supply chain. We were 
relatively well protected on purchases 
transacted in US$, although the strong 
sales performance and the decision 
to target Spring recruitment required 
additional stock purchases beyond our 
original plans. The business has put plans 
in place to address the foreign exchange 
headwinds for 2017/18 but the impact 
of inflation in the market is anticipated 
to have an impact on customers’ 
spending ability and choices. We are 
also utilising the expertise of our Far 
East sourcing office to ensure we have 
close relationships with suppliers and can 
source products at a level to maintain our 
strong value offer.
Express Gifts will utilise its flexible 
business model, its exceptional customer 
value and retail credit proposition 
to mitigate these uncertain market 
conditions.
Financial Services
The majority of our customers open 
a flexible account that allows them to 
choose whether to pay for their purchases 
within 21 days, or spread the cost over 
a number of months. Interest is charged 
on outstanding balances each month.
These consumer credit activities have 
been regulated by the Financial Conduct 
Authority since April 2014. Express Gifts 
has operated on an interim permission 
since that date, but in October 2016 we 
were granted our full authorisation. The 
standards expected by the FCA are high, 
and we have invested in our systems, 
processes and risk management over the 
last two years to ensure that we meet 
those high standards.
As part of that work, we have reviewed 
all the historical credit and insurance 
products sold after 2005. We identified 
those products that were flawed and 
have put in place programmes to refund 
affected customers over the next few 
months. We have made good progress 
already, with nearly £8m already returned 
to customers.
Financial income received during FY17 
increased by 12.6% on a like‑ for‑ like 
basis*, due to the increase in product 
sales plus the introduction towards the 
end of FY16 of “Risk‑ Based Pricing”, 
where the rate of interest charged to 
customers is tailored to the credit risk 
they present.
Moving forward, Express Gifts is well 
advanced in its implementation of a new 
credit account management system. 
This will provide a number of customer 
benefits, including improved statements 
(and e‑ statements), and will allow new 
financial services products to be offered 
to customers, ensuring this part of 
the business remains relevant for our 
customer base.
Our customer recruitment allows new 
starters to choose whether to open 
a credit account or utilise an alternative 
approach where cash is paid within 
21 days. We are looking at a variety of 
payment options moving forward and 
will utilise the capabilities of these new 
account management systems.
As part of the preparation for the new 
system, the business commissioned 
a new series of models to calculate its 
bad debt provision, using more granular 
predictions of potential default and loss for 
different categories of customer. Industry 
practice on this subjective area has 
evolved in recent years and so we have 
ensured that our new models are based 
on sustainable and realistic assumptions. 
This has produced a substantial increase 
to the provision, as discussed below, but  13
STRATEGIC REPORT 1—25 GOVERNANCE 26—72 CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 73—123 COMPANY FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 124—134

Express Gifts I Strategic Report
importantly does not change the way in 
which we manage customers’ accounts 
or the cash we expect to generate. Over 
time, the granular nature of the new 
models should allow for better credit 
decision making.
Operational efficiency
Express Gifts runs efficient customer 
service and warehouse operations to 
ensure it maintains its value proposition, 
whilst constantly seeking opportunities to 
improve the quality of these services and 
meet customers’ expectations.
In May 2016, we opened Express Gifts 
Philippines. This provides contact centre 
support to the business and provided 
increased capacity to handle peak season 
volumes with significant reduction in 
handling time, notably around email 
contacts. Since its opening, we have seen 
service levels (measured via our “net 
promoter score” survey) increase steadily 
and we are now in a position to grow this 
capability further.
The new websites launched at the start 
of the year help customers to manage 
enquiries online, rather than requiring 
telephone or email assistance for routine 
matters. This has reduced the number of 
inbound contacts significantly.
People
Paul Kendrick joined Express Gifts in May 
2016 as Commercial Director and Deputy 
Managing Director having previously held 
senior roles at Bonmarche and NBrown. 
In April 2017, he subsequently took on the 
role of Managing Director.
A degree of cultural change and people 
development is critical to the success of 
Express Gifts’ strategy. Our operational 
support functions need to evolve to 
meet the needs of a larger and digitally 
focused business. We integrated the 
Group Finance functions at the start of 
April to provide closer support to Express 
Gifts. A new Director of Financial Services 
joined in March, a new IT Director started 
in June 2017 and a new HR Director will 
start in August 2017.
FY17 performance and progress
The substantial growth in trading 
customer numbers seen in the year 
produced strong growth in product sales, 
which were up £35.2m or 15.6% on a like‑ for‑ like 52‑ week basis* (£37.4m or 16.6% 
on a 53‑ week GAAP basis) . Financial 
services income increased by 12.6% on 
a like‑ for‑ like basis* (14.7% on a 53‑ week 
GAAP basis). The impacts of marketing 
activity via the deeply discounted 
“showcase” lines in the first half of the 
year, together with higher import costs 
in the second half of the year led to 
gross profit increasing at a slower rate 
to £183.2m, although the gross product 
margin* remained broadly flat for the year 
as a whole at 31.3%.
The new websites, along with a number 
of other new fixed asset investments, 
replaced old items that had been 
fully depreciated several years ago. 
Consequently, the depreciation charge 
for the business increased from £4.4m 
to £6.6m in the year.
We noted at the end of last year that we 
planned to review the credit scorecards 
to ensure we balanced growth and fair 
outcomes for customers. Therefore, 
as anticipated and seen at the half‑ year, 
the adjusted bad debt charge* as a 
percentage of revenue therefore increased 
to 7.3% (FY16: 3.9%) which is within the 
expected range of 7‑ 8%. The introduction 
of the new bad debt provisioning models 
led to an individually significant charge 
of £35.2m being recognised. Other 
operational costs increased by 9.3% – 
significantly less than the level of sales 
growth in the period.
The investment in recruitment, the foreign 
exchange headwinds and the effect of 
the new bad debt model have led to the 
adjusted operating profit* being down 
slightly against the prior year at £30.4m 
(FY16: £31.7m). However, the growth of 
17% in our customer base provides sales 
momentum as we move into FY18.
Other individually significant charges 
totalling £18.7m were recorded in 
the year, principally due to increases 
in amounts provided in respect of 
customer refunds for legacy flawed 
financial services products, impairments 
of intangible assets resulting from the 
retirement of small legacy brands, and 
restructuring costs. After taking account 
of these, the business saw an operating 
loss of £23.5m.

Findel Education I Strategic Report
Our business model
Findel Education is one of the largest 
independent suppliers of school and 
early years resources (excluding IT and 
publishing) to primary, secondary and 
nursery educational establishments in the 
UK. The division’s international business 
unit exports to English‑ speaking schools 
in over 130 countries worldwide.
It offers three distinct brand propositions: 
School, Classroom and Specialist. The 
main route to market is via printed 
catalogues and, increasingly, via web 
based solutions, including multiple 
websites and e‑ procurement solutions. 
The School brands (GLS, A‑ Z and WNW) 
are primarily focused on servicing the 
basic commodity needs of all educational 
establishments with products such as 
stationery, janitorial supplies, furniture and 
arts & crafts materials. The Classroom 
brands (Hope Education) focus on the 
supply of specialist curriculum and early 
years teaching aids to Primary School 
and Nurseries. The Specialist brands 
(Davies Sports, Philip Harris Scientific, 
and Learning Development Aids – LDA) 
are specialists in their respective fields 
and focus on both Primary and Secondary 
school establishments.
The Commercial business unit focuses 
on new business opportunities covering 
multiple academy groups (MAT’s), 
LEA tenders, trade customers and key 
account customers.
Findel Education operates internationally 
and uses all of its product, brand strengths 
and market leading supply chain to support 
international schools in the delivery of their 
educational teaching requirements.
The business continues to maintain its 
strong relationship with Sainsbury’s PLC, 
having successfully delivered their Active 
Kids programme for 12 years.
Market conditions
Schools are typically funded based on an 
annual sum per pupil, which must cover 
costs such as buildings, staff, IT, utilities 
and educational resources. Whilst the total 
sum per pupil has kept pace with inflation, 
we have seen increased pressure in 
recent years on the educational resources 
element. In 2016/17 this was due to 
increased staff costs driven by mandatory 
increases in pension and NI contributions. 
This has in turn seen spending on 
school resources across the five major 
educational resources suppliers reducing 
by 6.3% in the 12 months to March 2017 
(BESA Market Data).
LEAs and schools are already planning 
and preparing for the School national fair 
funding formula that will come in during 
April 2018. This will see a redistribution 
of funding across regions in the UK which 
will put increased pressure on our London 
heartland schools.
At the same time, the long‑ term 
fundamentals remain positive with pupil 
numbers expected to increase by 0.55m 
through 2017‑ 2022, with the weighting of 
this being favourable towards London and 
Secondary schools. Our London based 
GLS School brand business is well placed 
to benefit from this.
The market has also continued to 
see strong movement towards more 
commercially focused Multi Academy 
Trusts (MATs) who are driving value 
through aggregated procurement. During 
the year, we have strengthened our 
Business Development team who are 
entirely focused on winning new MAT 
contracts through strong commercial and 
service led propositions.

Strategic Report I Findel Education
How are we responding to these 
market challenges
1.  We must support the UK schools’ 
ever-increasing needs as they 
continue to face challenging funding 
circumstances
The significant changes in funding 
and budgets have made teachers and 
bursars realise that budgets need 
to go further. Coupled with the fact 
that teachers are time poor, there is 
a need to ensure that we deliver the 
best value in the market through time‑ efficient digital procurement systems.
2.  We need to regain market share for 
the medium-term success of the 
business
Budgetary pressures will continue 
to be very challenging for the next 
few years and the total market may 
continue to contract. In addition to this, 
however, we have lost market share 
to our competitors in recent years, 
particularly in our Schools brands, and 
this has been the primary cause of 
our continued underperformance and 
reduction in operating profits.
We recognise that regaining market 
share is critical to the future success of 
the business. This is a strategy we are 
already making progress against.
We have a clear strategy based on 
value, service and digital solutions 
underpinned by cost reduction
Our strategy is simple – we need to 
deliver a one‑ stop shop where value and 
service are guaranteed. All of this needs 
to be supported by market‑ leading digital 
procurement solutions and a continuous 
focus upon reducing overheads to improve 
profitability.
Value “Delivering everything you need 
at everyday low prices”
We currently source just 7% of our 
products directly from the Far East, and 
don’t make sufficient use of the Group’s 
own sourcing office. We are going to 
significantly increase this over the next 
12 months.
The value we gain through this will be 
reinvested in lower prices for customers, 
whilst protecting our product margins. 
This will allow us to re‑ activate lost 
customers and increase the average 
spend of our established customers. 
Currently 90% of customers spend less 
than 10% of their budget allocated to our 
product ranges with us. This provides a 
significant opportunity to increase average 
sales per customer in future.
Service “Our service is the best in the 
marketplace”
We will continue to build on our impressive 
Net Promoter scores which increased from 
84% to 85% during FY17. In the year we 
were very pleased to win the UK Customer 
Experience award for Business Change. 
We know that high standards of customer 
service are essential to maintaining 
customer loyalty when schools are feeling 
budgetary pressure, so increasing this 
score further will remain a key strategic 
goal for the business.
Digital “Our market-leading digital 
solutions make shopping easy”
New market‑ leading digital website and 
e‑ procurement solutions are currently 
being launched, with each of our brands’ 
websites rolled out by July 2017. 
Currently just 18% of our sales come 
through digital channels, which is currently 
significantly below our market peers. The 
new solutions significantly improve site 
speed, product search, customer payment 
and checkout.
Our existing solutions were poor by 
comparison, which gives us confidence 
that online customer frequency and 
average order values will increase 
significantly over the coming months. The 
newly developed e‑ procurement systems 
integrate with existing school financial 
platforms, taking away lengthy and time 
consuming administration processes for

Our goal is to deliver to 50% of our sales

24 months.
Profitability “Simplifying our business 
operations to improve the return on 
sales to peer-levels”
During November 2016, we completed 
our major business IT systems and 
warehouse integration programme. This 
has been an investment of around £7m to 
produce a modernised distribution facility 
in Nottingham and a single core ERP IT 
system for the business. This will deliver 
£2‑ 3m of annual cost benefits from FY18, 
whilst also improving our operational 
service levels.
We have subsequently reviewed our 
distribution arrangements in the light 
of having just one warehouse and have 
identified significant streamlining and cost 
savings that will start to come through in 
Q4 of FY18. Further business simplification 
actions have also been identified to reduce 
costs and improve our return on sales back 
to peer‑ levels over the next 2‑ 3 years.
FY17 Performance and Progress
FY17 was another challenging year with 
overall sales down by 3.3% on a like‑ for‑ like basis* against the prior year (2.8% on 
a GAAP basis for the 53‑ week period). As 
noted above, this has been driven entirely 
by our School brands which were 10.6% 
down against the prior year on a like‑ for‑ like* basis. The rest of the business 
showed growth of 2.4% on a like‑ for‑ like* 
basis against the prior year against the 
backdrop of an overall market decline.
Product margins held up well against the 
prior year, although we had to invest unit 
cost savings into deeper discounting on 
our UK brands to support sales.
The timing of the launch of the Hope 
brand’s annual catalogues was changed 
from April to January this year to better 
align with customer requirements, which 
produced a one‑ time timing impact of 
(£0.9m). This was offset by equivalent 
gains from the early delivery of the 
warehouse consolidation and systems 
project. Other overhead costs were 
broadly unchanged.
The divisional adjusted operating profit* 
fell to £1.4m (FY16: £3.2m). The continued 
decline in revenue and hardening of 
market conditions plus Findel Education’s 
continued failure to hit internal forecasts, 
has led management to record a £19.8m 
impairment charge in respect of the 
goodwill and other intangible assets 
allocated to the Findel Education Cash 
Generating Unit (CGU). This has been 
recorded as an individually significant 
item. Further individually significant items 
have been recorded in respect of the early 
retirement of the business’s former web 
platform and an onerous lease provision in 
respect of areas of the business’ head office 
which are no longer in use, bringing the total 
to £28.0m. After taking this into account, 
Findel Education reported an operating loss 
of £26.6m (FY16: loss of £2.4m).

based upon current estimates. However, 
these inherently remain subject to change 
in the light of actual costs incurred and 
ongoing evolution of market practice.
Receivables provisioning
As disclosed in last year’s annual report, 
during FY16 management commenced 
a comprehensive build of a new statistical 
model for calculating the impairment 
of trade receivables, which has been 
completed during FY17. The new model 
has enabled management, at the FY17 
year end, to assess impairment at an 
account level. In comparison to the model 
previously used by the Group, the new 
model allows for the calculation of a more 
precise impairment provision, based on 
the risk rating of individual customers. 
The impairment model used in prior years 
necessitated the estimate of impairment 
provisions based on an assessment of 
the population on a collective basis, which 
included the use of averages, based on 
historic roll rates and collection rates.
The granular information provided by the 
new model has also enabled management 
to have greater visibility over the impact 
of changes introduced to receivables 
collection processes by Express Gifts in 
recent periods, including the introduction 
of a strategy to pursue the sale of 
significantly overdue receivables to third‑ parties. As a result management are able 
to predict with a greater level of accuracy, 
based on actual historical performance and 
specific customer behaviour, the level of 
provisions required, including for accounts 
in forbearance arrangements, and to 
factor in more balanced estimates of the 
Group’s experience of emergence periods. 
Management have also sought to reflect

redress and refunds
Reviews of the provisions required 
for redress and refunds to customers 
for flawed financial services have taken 
place throughout the year as additional 
information and granularity has become 
available. An additional £14.7m has been 
set aside as an individually significant 
charge to cover these exposures based 
upon information and estimates made 
at the current time. £4.0m was repaid 
to customers during FY17 and a further 
£3.6m has been paid since the year end. 
We have noted the recent guidance from 
the Financial Conduct Authority in relation 
to the remaining claims for Payment 
Protection Insurance and the impact of 
the Plevin case. We believe that our 
provisions in relation to this are adequate

the impact of a more balanced approach 
to its debt sale strategy within the year 
end estimate, which includes assumptions 
around the future value, probability and 
timing of the expected cash flows from 
the debt sales.
Following the adoption of the new model 
during FY17, there has been an increase 
in the impairment provision at March 
2017 of £35.2m. This increase represents 
the impact of changes in accounting 
estimates since the prior year as a result 
of the ability to conduct a more granular 
account by account bad debt estimate 
and additional information which became 
available during FY17. In assessing the 
appropriate treatment of this increase in 
provision, management has considered 
whether an adjustment to the level of 
provision recognised at 31 March 2017 
and prior should be recognised as a prior 
period adjustment in accordance with 
IAS 8. As the additional provision has 
arisen from the development of the new 
model during the year, and is based on 
information which was not available to 
the Group in prior years, management has 
recognised the increase in the provision 
in the current year. Due to the scale of 
the charge, however, and as the charge 
does not relate to the current trading 
period, management has concluded that 
the additional charge should be separately 
disclosed, as an individually significant 
item, in the income statement.
It is important to note that the changes 
to the provision have no impact upon 
the cash generation from customer 
receivables, or on the way in which 
customer accounts are managed on a 
day‑ to‑ day basis. Over time, the granular 
nature of the new models should allow for 
better credit decision making.
Onerous lease provisions
The Group’s head‑ office functions 
relocated from the offices in Hyde that 
it shared with Findel Education to the 
Accrington site used by Express Gifts. 
The move will result in ongoing cost 
savings and more closely align the Group 
functions and Express Gifts. Findel 
Education will remain in situ in Hyde 
and new tenants will be sought for the 
vacated space. In light of current market 
rates, and the lease running until 2034, 
the Group has therefore recognised an 
onerous lease provision of £7.5m as an 
individually significant item. The provision 
will be utilised and the associated cash 
costs will be incurred over the period 
to 2034.
Impairment of Intangible assets
Findel Education has a significant level 
of intangible assets, including brands 
and goodwill, that arose from a series of 
acquisitions undertaken over a decade 
ago. Accounting standards require us to 
review the carrying value of those non‑ amortising intangible assets each year 
against the anticipated discounted future 
cashflows from the division. We indicated 
in last year’s accounts that the position 
was sensitive to downside changes to 
forecast assumptions. As indicated in the 
Strategic Review on pages 14 to 16, the 
market conditions facing Findel Education 
remain challenging in the light of ongoing 
austerity and budgetary pressures for 
schools. The business’s own performance 
has also fallen short of previous internal 
expectations in FY17, with corresponding 
reductions in the pace of recovery for 
future years. The completion of the 
warehouse consolidation in November 
2016 and the cost savings that flow from 
that action are anticipated to improve 
profits in FY18. However, those savings 
were already assumed within previous 
impairment reviews. Consequently, 
an impairment of £19.8m has been 
recognised as an individually significant 
charge. There are no ongoing cash 
implications from this charge.
Intangible assets and goodwill totalling 
£1.4m relating to the HHS brand previously 
used by Express Gifts have been impaired 
during the year, as the business focuses 
upon its Studio and Ace brands.
Restructuring
The ongoing transformation of the Group’s 
businesses has resulted in individually 
significant restructuring costs totalling 
£2.3m being recognised during the year. 
£0.3m of this was settled within the year, 
with the remaining £2.0m expected to be 
settled during FY18.
Pensions
The Group has continued to make 
additional voluntary contributions to its 
defined benefit schemes totalling £2.3m 
in the current financial period (FY16: 
£2.5m) to improve the funding levels of 
these closed schemes. An agreement has 
been reached with the scheme trustees 
on the ongoing level of contributions, 
which will remain at £2.5m in FY18, rising 
to £5.0m from FY20 until FY23. The net 
deficit at the end of FY17 measured 
in accordance with IAS19 increased to 
£5.4m (FY16: £2.3m) due to a lower 
discount rate being used to value the 
scheme’s liabilities offset by the additional 
employer contributions.
Taxation
The Group posted a credit of £1.7m in 
the year in respect of taxation for the 
continuing operations (FY16: £0.1m). The 
effective rate of tax for the year before 
individually significant items was 21.1% 
(FY16: 21.1%).
Earnings per share
The adjusted earnings per share for the 
year reduced from 22.70p in FY16 to 
20.19p in FY17. The basic loss per share 
from continuing operations was 66.85p 
per share (FY16: loss per share of 1.85p).

Cash flow and borrowings
A part of management’s variable incentive 
plans relates to the generation of free 
cashflow, as defined in the table below. 
Free cashflow generation was £13.3m 
(FY16: £4.5m). After taking account of 
interest and the net proceeds of M&A 
activities, the Group’s core net debt

The Group’s bank facilities were

facilities all maturing in November 2019. 
The securitisation facility was increased 
during the year from £145m to £155m to 
cater for the continued growth in Express 
Gifts’ credit receivables.
Dividends and capital structure
The directors have determined that no 
interim dividend will be paid (FY16: nil) 
and are not recommending the payment 
of a final dividend (FY16: nil).
The Company has not received any 
dividends from its subsidiaries during the 
period and its balance sheet as at the 
end of March 2017 shows a deficiency 
of £95.3m on its retained reserves 
(FY16: deficiency of £33.2m). The position 
has worsened as a result of a review of 
the carrying value of Findel Education 
Limited in the light of its intangible asset 
impairment noted above. Findel plc is 
therefore not yet in a position to declare 
a dividend. As described in the Strategic 
Report, the Company does not have plans 
to reinstate dividend payments at this 
stage.
Treasury and risk management
The Group’s central treasury function 
seeks to reduce or eliminate exposure to 
foreign exchange, interest rate and other 
financial risks, to ensure sufficient liquidity 
is available to meet foreseeable needs and 
to invest cash assets safely and profitably. 
It does not engage in speculative 
transactions and transacts only in relation 
to underlying business requirements in 
accordance with approved policies.
Interest rate risk management
The Group’s interest rate exposure 
is managed by the use of derivative 
arrangements as appropriate, details of 
which are set out in note 28 to the financial 
statements. The Group has purchased 
interest rate caps covering the period to 
October 2018 to protect against the risk of 
unforeseen increases to LIBOR rates.
Net finance costs for the year were 
£8.9m, slightly lower than the £9.9m from 
FY16, reflecting lower pension scheme 
interest and the lower borrowing margin 
achieved in Q4. This charge was covered 
3.5 times by adjusted operating profit* 
(FY16: 3.5 times).
Currency risk management
A significant proportion of the products 
sold, principally through the Group’s 
Express Gifts division, are procured 
through the Group’s Far East buying office 
and beyond. The currency of purchase for 
these goods is principally the US dollar, 
with a small proportion being denominated 
in Hong Kong dollars.
The Group’s hedging policy aims to cover 
anticipated future exposures on a rolling 
12‑ month basis. As at the balance 
sheet date, the Group had forward 
contracts with an outstanding principal 
of $52m (FY16: nil). The market value 
and unreaslised gain on those contracts 
in F17 was £0.6m, and is presented 
separately on the Income Statement as 
it represents an element of product costs 
to be realised in FY18 as the contracts 
unwind. The Group currently has forward 
contracts in place with an outstanding 
principal of $85m covering the 12 months 
to June 2018.
In addition to this direct exposure, the 
divisions face a significant level of indirect 
exposure from supplies made by UK 
suppliers who in turn source goods from 
overseas. That risk is normally mitigated 
through a combination of supplier 
agreements and fixed term pricing, 
although from time to time there may 
be a requirement to increase prices to 
customers to maintain margins.
Borrowing and counterparty risk
The Group’s exposure to borrowing 
and cash investment risk is managed 
by dealing only with banks and financial 
institutions with strong credit ratings.

The directors use several Alternative 
Performance Measures (“APMs”) that are 
considered to provide useful information 
about the performance and underlying 
trends facing the Group. As these APMs 
are not defined by IFRS, they may not 
be comparable with APMs shown in

superior to, IFRS measures.
The principal APMs used in this Annual 
Report are set out below.
Adjusted EBITDA, adjusted operating 
profit and adjusted profit before tax
Individually significant items are non‑ recurrent and therefore not reflective 
of the underlying performance of the 
Group. We therefore exclude them when 
assessing segment performance. The 
Group’s foreign exchange hedging policy 
means that there will be unrealised fair 
value gains or losses at the period end 
relating to contracts intended for future 
periods. Those fair value movements are 
therefore excluded from the underlying 
performance of the Group until realised.

Like-for-like revenue
The Group’s businesses operate to a 
weekly reporting cycle, rather than a 
calendar month cycle. Consequently, it 
normally reports upon a 52‑ week period. 
The prior year ended on 25 March 2016, 
so the directors decided to make the 
current year a 53‑ week period ending on 
31 March 2017 to return closer to the 
Group’s statutory reporting date of March.
A like‑ for‑ like comparison of revenue in 
a 52‑ week period has been selected as

Express Gifts gross product profit
Express Gifts has two primary sources 
of revenue, sale of goods and financial 
services. In order to assess the gross 
profit derived from the sale of goods 
and the corresponding margin %, it is 
necessary to deduct the financial services 
revenues from the reported gross profit, 
as follows:

Risk Root cause Key mitigating controls
Regulatory risks
The financial services activities of 
Express Gifts are subject to regulation 
from the Financial Conduct Authority 
(FCA)
The withdrawal or material variation 
of this permission would have a 
material adverse effect on the Group. 
In addition, any changes in legislation, 
regulation or FCA policy (for example 
restrictions on interest rates or account 
fees) could have a material adverse 
effect on the Group
The Group has taken advice from 
industry‑ recognised third party 
professionals to put in place appropriate 
practices, policies and plans. It 
monitors developments and changes 
to regulatory standards internally and in 
conjunction with advisors
It is also required to conduct its 
business and develop operating 
cultures that mitigate against the risk of 
its customers receiving a poor outcome 
from its financial services activities
Failure to manage this conduct risk may 
lead to customers seeking appropriate 
levels of redress or refund, as well as 
the potential withdrawal of its FCA 
permissions
The Group monitors compliance 
with applicable financial services and 
consumer credit regulations by taking 
advice from industry‑ recognised third 
party professionals, where appropriate. 
It also undertakes regular training on 
conduct‑ related matters with relevant 
directors, employees and managers
The refund and redress programmes 
for legacy financial services products 
costs more than currently anticipated, 
and/or is not conducted in line with the 
FCA’s expectations
Weaknesses in the models, and/or 
the assumptions used to estimate the 
sums required, and/or the processes 
used to facilitate the programme lead 
to further material changes to the cost
External advice has been taken to 
produce customer‑ level calculations of 
sums due and experienced co‑ sourcing 
partners have been engaged to assist 
with the implementation. We have 
regular dialogue with the FCA
Risks specific to the Group’s 
divisions
Express Gifts is seasonal, and is more 
heavily weighted towards the second 
half of the financial year. In Findel 
Education, the September “Back‑ to‑ School” period accounts for much of 
the market’s annual sales and profits
Seasonal fluctuations in trading 
volumes can lead to staffing levels and 
systems resilience being insufficient to 
meet peak demand, whilst being sub‑ optimal at quieter times
The seasonal trends are highly 
predictable and the Group is focused 
on delivering a high quality of service 
and being well prepared for managing 
peak demand in both of its businesses
We lose specific key customers within 
our Education markets
We fail to secure and/or retain positions 
on key regional panels of preferred 
suppliers
We proactively engage using dedicated 
customer relationship managers to 
ensure we are delivering the outcomes 
that they expect and also explore 
broader options in areas such as

Strategic Report I Principal risks and uncertainties
Risk Root cause Key mitigating controls
The Group is dependent on third parties 
for outsourcing functions
Interruptions in the supply of 
outsourcing functions could have 
an adverse effect on the Group’s 
business
The Group carries out extensive 
reviews of any potential outsourcing 
partner. The Group has established 
disaster recovery procedures designed 
to minimise the impact of any such 
disruption. The Group also carries 
insurance cover against the potential 
loss of key facilities
Financial risk
The Group is reliant on the continued 
provision of credit facilities, and the 
ability to refinance them as they fall 
due, to support its operations
The current facility agreements which 
mature in November 2019 include 
various financial and operational 
covenants which, if not complied with, 
would enable the lenders to seek 
immediate repayment of amounts 
outstanding under the outstanding 
credit facilities
The level of headroom against the 
covenants within the new facility 
agreement mitigates this risk
The business is required to comply 
with applicable taxation laws
Failure to manage this risk may lead to 
penalties being imposed
The Group monitors compliance with 
applicable tax laws by taking advice 
from industry‑ recognised third party 
professionals, where appropriate. It does 
not undertake any tax planning schemes
Operational risk
Both Express Gifts and Findel 
Education are undergoing a significant 
amount of operational and systems 
transformation
Failure to manage this change, risks 
disruption to operations or a failure to 
achieve the planned level of benefits
The businesses both rely upon having 
dedicated project management teams 
and appropriate levels of governance to 
oversee change management
The Group’s businesses rely upon the 
ability to source products for resale to 
its customers
Interruptions in the availability or 
flow of stock from third‑ party product 
suppliers, or issues arising from the 
sale of faulty or defective goods 
leading to product recalls could have 
an adverse effect on the Group’s 
business
To mitigate this risk, the Group 
purchases products from a wide variety 
of domestic and international third 
party product suppliers and engages in 
appropriate quality assurance processes. 
Further details of these processes 
are set out in the Corporate Social 
Responsibility Report on pages 63 to 65
The Group may be subject to  
cyber‑ attacks/malware
Prolonged attacks could lead to a 
material disruption to operations and/or 
a loss of key systems and data
This risk is mitigated through the 
security systems within the Group’s IT 
infrastructure and through maintenance 
of appropriate back‑ up procedures. 
The Group monitors potential new 
threats from cyber‑ attack and deploys 
appropriate levels of resource to close 
emerging loopholes. It has business 
continuity plans covering both the 
business and customer engagement 
and carries insurance cover against a 
prolonged loss of service. Employees 
receive training to identify potential 
threats

Board of Directors Governance I Directors’ Report

Findel plc 
Annual report and accounts 2017
Directors’ Report
The directors present their annual report and accounts on the affairs of the Group, together with the financial statements and 
Auditors’ report for the 53 week period ended 31 March 2017. The Corporate Governance Report set out on pages 32 to 35 forms 
part of this report.
Strategic Report
Pursuant to sections 414A-D Companies Act 2006, the Strategic Report can be found on pages 1 to 25. This includes a review of 
the Group’s activities; the principal risks and uncertainties facing the Group; the main trends and factors likely to affect the future 
development, performance or position of the Group’s business; and the key performance indicators identified by management. 
The Directors’ Report and the Strategic Report also comprises the management report for the purposes of the FCA Disclosure and 
Transparency Rules (DTR 4.1.8R). All such information as is required to be contained in this report by s.417 of the Companies Act 
2006 is incorporated by reference into this report.
Going concern
In determining whether the Group’s financial statements for the period ended 31 March 2017 can be prepared on a going concern 
basis, the directors considered all factors likely to affect its future development, performance and its financial position, including its 
cash flows, liquidity position and borrowing facilities and the risks and uncertainties relating to its business activities in the current 
economic climate. The financial position of the Group, its cash flows, liquidity position and borrowing facilities and details of those 
key risks and uncertainties are set out in further detail in the Finance Director’s Review on pages 18 to 20.
The directors have reviewed the Group’s trading and cash flow forecasts as part of their going concern assessment, including 
considering the potential impact of reasonably possible downside sensitivities which take into account the uncertainties in the 
current operating environment, including amongst other matters, demand for the Group’s products, its available financing facilities, 
and regulatory licensing and compliance. Although at certain times the level of facility and/or covenant headroom reduces to a 
level which requires cash flow initiatives to be introduced to ensure that the funding requirements do not exceed the committed 
facilities or result in non-compliance with covenants, management are confident that such actions are supportable, and that further 
controllable mitigating actions are available that could be implemented if required. The Group’s current banking facilities mature in 
December 2019.
Taking into account the above circumstances, the directors have formed a judgement that there is a reasonable expectation, and 
there are no material uncertainties that the Group and the Company have adequate resources to continue in operational existence 
for a period of at least 12 months.
Accordingly, they continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the Group’s annual consolidated financial statements.
Viability Statement
While the financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, the provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code 
requires the directors to make a statement in the annual report with regard to the viability of the Group, including explaining how they 
have assessed the prospects of the Group, the period of time for which they have made the assessment and why they consider that 
period to be appropriate. The Board has reviewed the viability of the Group for the three year period up to March 2020.
The Board selected this period of review as it aligns with the Group’s normal strategic planning process which results in the 
development and approval by the Board of medium-term business plans each year. These plans consider the Group’s future 
projections of sales growth, profitability, cash flows, capital requirements and resources for each of its divisions, together with 
covenant compliance and other relevant financial and regulatory ratios over the forecast period.
The plans were then subjected to sensitivity analyses that considered the Group’s resilience to the occurrence of reasonable 
downside scenarios. Consideration was also given to the likely impact of the Group’s principal risks over that planning horizon after 
taking account of the mitigation actions that could be taken to reduce the impact or occurrence of those risks, which are set out in 
the principal risks and uncertainties section on pages 22 to 24.
On the basis of this review, the Board confirms that it has a reasonable expectation that the Group will be able to continue in 
operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due over the three year period up to March 2020.
Dividends
The directors have determined that no interim dividend will be paid (FY16: nil) and are not recommending the payment of a final 
dividend (FY16: nil).
The Board will focus on strengthening the financial position of each of the operating subsidiaries’ balance sheets and that of the 
parent company. As such the Company does not have plans to re-instate dividend payments at this stage.
The rights of the holders of convertible shares to restrict dividends are set out below. 29

Financial Risk Management
Policies on financial risk management are set out in note 28, on pages 57 and 58 of the Report of the Audit Committee, on page 62 
of the Report of the Risk Committee and on pages 22 and 24 of the Strategic Report.
Capital Structure
Details of the issued share capital, together with details of the movements in the Company’s issued share capital during the year 
are shown in note 24 and such information is incorporated into this report.
The Company has two classes of share, neither of which carries rights to fixed income. The rights and obligations attaching to both 
classes of share are contained in the Articles of Association, a copy of which is available for inspection at the registered office of 
the Company. The ordinary shares carry the right to attend and speak at general meetings of the Company, to one vote on each 
resolution at such meetings, to appoint proxies to exercise full voting rights and to participate in any distribution of income or capital. 
The holders of convertible shares have a right to attend meetings but no voting rights (save in respect of any resolution relating to 
the rights of the convertible shares). The following rights and restrictions attach to the convertible shares:
• rights attaching to the convertible shares may only be varied by resolution passed by the holders of 85% or more of the nominal 
value of the convertible shares then in issue;
• consent of 85% of the holders of convertible shares is required before the Company declares any dividend or distribution in 
excess of 50% of the Group’s net income in respect of any accounting reference period, and the convertible shares have the 
right to participate in any dividend to the extent that it exceeds 50% of the Group’s net income in respect of any accounting 
reference period;
• the right to elect to participate in any return of capital on a voluntary winding-up of the Company as if the convertible shares had 
been converted into ordinary shares;
• the right to convert the convertible shares into ordinary shares between 28 February 2013 and 28 February 2021 (Conversion 
Period) if the volume weighted average ordinary share price is greater than 479.4p;
• the convertible shares will automatically be converted into ordinary shares in the event of a takeover offer;
• on conversion into new ordinary shares the convertible shares will rank pari passu with existing ordinary shares;
• until expiry of the Conversion Period, or earlier conversion, the Company is subject to certain restrictions including that it shall 
not, without the consent of 85% of the holders of convertible shares:
 – vary the rights attached to the ordinary shares;
 – create a new class of shares ranking ahead of the ordinary shares;
 – convert the Company from a public company to a private company (other than pursuant to a takeover offer);
 – issue loan stock or debt instruments or enter into any borrowing save on arm’s length terms.
If the convertible shares have not converted into ordinary shares within the Conversion Period they will automatically convert into 
non-voting deferred shares with no voting or profit participation rights.
There are no specific restrictions on the size of a holding or on the transfer of ordinary shares or convertible shares and there 
are no requirements for prior approval of any transfers; all such matters are governed by the general provisions of the Articles of 
Association and prevailing legislation. The directors are not aware of any agreements between holders of the Company’s shares 
that may result in restrictions on the transfer of securities or on voting rights. The Articles of Association may only be changed with 
agreement of shareholders.
Details of employee share schemes are set out in note 23. Shares held by the Company’s Employee Benefit Trust rank pari passu 
with the ordinary shares in issue and have no special rights, but abstain from voting.
No person has any special rights of control over the Company’s share capital and all issued shares are fully paid.
There are a number of agreements that take effect, alter or terminate upon a change of control of the Company such as commercial 
contracts, bank loan agreements, property lease arrangements and employees’ share plans. Any such situation would be carefully 
managed to ensure that any effect on the business was minimised. Furthermore, the directors are not aware of any agreements 
between the Company and its directors or employees that provide for compensation for loss of office or employment that occurs as 
a consequence of a takeover bid, other than as disclosed in the Board Report on Directors’ Remuneration. Directors’ Report

Acquisition of own shares
The Company did not obtain authority from shareholders at the AGM held in July 2016 to purchase its own shares. The Company 
made no purchases of its own shares during the financial year and no shares were acquired by forfeiture or surrender or made 
subject to a lien or charge.
Directors
The directors of the Company at the date of this report are shown on page 27. Information concerning their interests in the share 
capital of the Company as at 31 March 2017 and as at 26 June 2017 is included in the Board Report on Directors’ Remuneration on 
page 54. All the directors served throughout the year save that Mr Burke was appointed to the Board on 12 January 2017, replacing 
Mr Sugden as chairman of the Board, who stepped down from the Board on the same date. Since the year end Mr Kowalski has also 
stepped down from the Board with effect from 5 April 2017. A summary of the rules relating to the appointment and removal 
of directors and details regarding the powers of the directors are set out in the Corporate Governance Report on pages 32 to 35. 
Notwithstanding those rules the Board has decided that all members of the Board will now put themselves up for election or annual 
re-election.
Following the annual performance evaluation, the Board confirms that the performance of each of the directors has been effective 
throughout the period, or throughout the period since their appointment, and that they have continued to demonstrate commitment 
to their roles. The Nomination Committee endorses their proposed reappointment at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting.
Mr Maudsley has a service contract with the Company which provides a 12 month notice period which will reduce to 6 months 
on 1 April 2018. As at the year-end Mr Burke had a service contract with the Company which provided a 6 month notice period, 
however on switching status to that of a non-executive chairman on 5 April 2017 that agreement was terminated by mutual 
consent (so that he no longer has a service contract with the Company) and he now has a 1 month notice period under his 
letter of appointment. Mr Tracey as a non-executive director does not have a service contract with the Company. His letter of 
appointment provides for a 3 month period of notice. The other non-executive directors do not have service contracts with the 
Company and their letters of appointment do not provide for a period of notice. The appointment of non-executive directors is normally 
for an initial period of three years, subject to review and re-election in General Meeting. Further details of the service contracts and 
letters of appointment of directors can be found on pages 44 and 45 of the Board’s Report on Directors’ Remuneration.
Directors’ and Officers’ Insurance and Indemnity
The Group maintained insurance for directors and officers of the Group during the financial year, indemnifying them (to the extent 
permitted by law and the Company’s Articles of Association) against certain liabilities incurred by them when acting on behalf of 
the Group. The Company has executed deeds of indemnity for the benefit of each director in respect of liabilities which may attach 
to them in their capacity as directors of the Company. Neither the insurance nor the deeds of indemnity provide cover where the 
relevant director or officer has acted fraudulently or dishonestly.
Employees
The Company recognises its social and statutory duty to employ disabled persons and pursues a policy of providing, wherever 
possible, the same employment opportunities to disabled persons as to others, and training for employees who have become 
disabled during the period when they were employed by the Group. Information to employees regarding the Company and factors 
affecting its performance and that of its subsidiaries is provided through normal management channels and regular consultation.
Environmental matters
Information on environmental matters, including our greenhouse gas emissions is disclosed in the Corporate Social Responsibility 
Report on pages 63 to 65.
Overseas Branches
The Group does not have any branches outside the United Kingdom.

Compliance
The Board considers that throughout the year under review the Company has complied with the relevant provisions of the 2014 
issue of the UK Corporate Governance Code (the “Code”), and with the rules of the UK Listing Authority, save that the Board 
operated with an Executive Chairman throughout the year. A copy of the Code can be located at https://www.frc.org.uk.
Application of the principles of the Code
This report explains how the Company has applied the main principles of the Code to its activities. The section of the Code entitled 
“Main Principles of the Code” sets out the main and supporting principles of good governance for companies, which are split into 
the following topics: leadership; effectiveness; accountability; remuneration and relations with shareholders.
The Board
At 31 March 2017, the Board was made up of seven members comprising the Chairman, Mr Burke; the finance director, 
Mr Kowalski; a further executive director, Mr Maudsley and four non-executive directors. The non-executive directors are each 
considered by the Board to be independent of management and free of any relationship which could materially interfere with the 
exercise of their independent judgement. Biographical details of each of the directors, which illustrate their range of experience, 
are set out on page 27.
The current Chairman, Mr Burke, joined the Board on 12 January 2017, taking over as executive chairman from Mr Sugden who 
stepped down from the Board on the same date. Mr Burke’s other commitments are summarised in the biographical details on 
page 27 and the Board considers these are not a constraint on his agreed time commitment to the Company. On 5 April 2017 
Mr Burke became non-executive chairman. The Board considers Mr Burke to be independent at the time of his appointment and 
on the change of his status notwithstanding his short period of executive service which the Board considers to be a very short-term 
transitionary period and in respect of which he did not participate in any incentive plans.
On 5 April 2017, as Mr Burke stepped back into a non-executive chairman role, Mr Maudsley was appointed Chief Executive of 
the Company, returning the Board to a more usual governance structure. On the same date, Mr Kowalski stepped down from the 
Board and the Company is currently operating with an Acting CFO who is not a director of the Company pending the completion 
of a formal recruitment process for a new Finance Director which is being overseen by the Nominations Committee.
The Senior Independent Director is Mr Tracey and he is the director whom shareholders may contact if they feel their concerns 
are not being addressed through the normal channels. During the period under review the Company operated with an Executive 
Chairman and the role of the Senior Independent Director was enhanced, including in the following ways, to ensure continued 
independent oversight by the Board:
• Chairing the Nomination Committee
• Agreeing Board agenda and minutes with the Executive Chairman
• An enhanced role in shareholder meetings
• Carrying out the annual appraisal of Board performance
• Reporting to shareholders via a Nomination Committee Report in the annual report.
Following the change of status of the chairman to that of a non-executive chairman and the appointment of Mr Maudsley as CEO, 
the role of the Senior Independent Director has reverted to a more normal brief and Mr Burke has taken over the role of chair of the 
Nomination Committee. The non-executive directors met during the year without the executive directors present.
Directors are subject to election at the annual general meeting immediately following their appointment and are subject to 
reappointment at least every three years. The Board has determined that in the normal course non-executive directors will be asked 
to serve two terms of three years. The Board assesses annually whether each non-executive director is independent against the 
criteria set out in the Code.
The appointment and replacement of directors of the Company is governed by the Company’s Articles of Association, the Code, the 
Companies Act 2006 and related legislation. The Articles themselves may be amended by special resolution of the shareholders. 
The powers of directors are described in the Articles and the Main Board Terms of Reference, copies of which are available on 
request, and are summarised in the Corporate Governance Report on pages 32 to 35.
Notwithstanding the above the Board has determined that all directors should in future stand for election or re-election on an annual 
basis and this approach will be adopted at the 2017 Annual General Meeting.
During the period ended 31 March 2017, no director had any material interest in any significant contract to which the Company or 
any subsidiary was a party. Corporate Governance Report I Governance

Conflicts of Interest
The Company has a procedure for the disclosure, review, authorisation and management of directors’ conflicts of interest and 
potential conflicts of interest, in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006. The procedure is included in the 
Articles of Association and has been adhered to by the Board since its introduction. In deciding whether to authorise a conflict 
or potential conflict of interest, the directors must have regard to their general duties under the Companies Act 2006. The 
authorisation of any conflict matter, and the terms of authorisation are reviewed by the Board as appropriate and, as a minimum, 
on an annual basis.
Board Procedures
The Board met formally in person or by telephone conference call on 15 occasions during the period (3 of which were two day 
meetings) and individual attendance at those and at the meetings of the Audit Committee, the Remuneration Committee, the Risk 
Committee and the Nomination Committee is set out in the table below. The Board receives adequate and timely information 
to enable the directors to discharge their duties. In addition to matters statutorily reserved for a board, there is an agreed schedule 
of matters reserved for the Board for collective decision including:
• determining the strategy and control of the Group;
• amendments to the structure and capital of the Group;
• approval of financial reporting and internal controls;
• approval of capital and revenue expenditure of a significant size;
• acquisitions and disposals above a prescribed level; and
• corporate governance matters and approval of Group policies and risk management strategies.
The Board delegates to management the day to day management of the Company’s businesses and other matters not specifically 
reserved to the Board.
Further details relating to the Company’s internal control and risk management systems in relation to the financial reporting process 
can be found in the Report of the Audit Committee on pages 57 to 60 and in the Report of the Risk Committee on pages 61 to 62. 
The Reports of the Audit Committee and the Risk Committee form part of this Corporate Governance Report and are incorporated 
into this Corporate Governance Report by reference.
To enable the Board to perform its duties effectively all directors have full access to all relevant information and to the services 
of the Company Secretary whose responsibility it is to ensure that Board procedures are followed. The appointment and removal 
of the Company Secretary is a matter reserved for the Board. There is an agreed procedure whereby directors wishing to take 
independent legal advice in the furtherance of their duties may do so at the Company’s expense. Appropriate training is available 
to all directors on appointment and on an ongoing basis as required.
The terms of reference for each of the Board Committees are available on request from the Company Secretary or on the 
Company’s website (www.findel.co.uk).

Board Effectiveness
During the year the Board completed its first independently facilitated review of its effectiveness, and the effectiveness of its 
standing committees. The review was facilitated by Mr Tom Bonham Carter of Armstrong Bonham Carter LLP and he discussed his 
reports with each of the Chairman, the Senior Independent Director and the respective chairmen of the standing committees before 
a full board discussion was held in March 2017. Subsequently the Chairman held one to one meetings with each of the directors to 
discuss feedback regarding that director’s performance. The Board accepted the conclusions of the review and has a plan of action 
for further improvements in its processes and performance.
The Senior Independent Director met during the financial year with each of the non-executive directors to discuss the performance 
of the Chairman. The Senior Independent Director has discussed the results of that assessment with the Chairman.
Relations with Shareholders
The Company recognises the importance of communicating with its shareholders, to ensure that its strategy and performance 
are understood. This is achieved principally through the Interim Report, periodic trading statements, the Annual Report and 
the Annual General Meeting. In addition, a range of corporate information is available to investors on the Company’s website 
(www.findel.co.uk).
The Chairman, the CEO and the Finance Director are primarily responsible for investor relations. Feedback from major shareholders 
is reported to the Board and discussed at its meetings and from time to time the Chairman also discusses the views of the 
Company’s major shareholders with the non-executive directors. Formal presentations are made to institutional shareholders 
following the announcement of the Company’s full year and half year results. During the year the Senior Independent Director and 
the Chairman of the Remuneration Committee also meet with institutional shareholders as required. The Board recognises that 
the Annual General Meeting is the principal forum for dialogue with private shareholders. All directors normally attend the Annual 
General Meeting and are available to answer any questions that shareholders may wish to raise. The Notice of Meeting is sent to 
shareholders at least 20 working days before the meeting. Shareholders vote on a show of hands, unless a poll is validly called and 
after each such vote the number of proxy votes received for and against the resolution is announced.
Powers of the Board
The directors manage the business of the Company subject to the Companies Act 2006 and the Articles of Association of the 
Company and subject to such directions as are prescribed by the Company by special resolution.
The Board may exercise all the powers of the Company to borrow money and to mortgage or charge its undertaking, property, 
assets and uncalled capital and to issue debentures and other securities whether outright or as collateral security, for any debt, 
liability or obligation of the Company or of any third party. The Board must restrict the borrowings of the Company and exercise all 
powers of control exercisable over its subsidiaries (if any) so that the total amount of the Findel Group’s borrowings (exclusive of 
inter-group borrowings) do not exceed £450,000,000. However, the Company may pass an ordinary resolution allowing borrowings 
to exceed such limit.
The Board may, subject to the provisions of the Companies Act and shareholder approval where required, exercise its authority to 
allot shares, grant rights to subscribe for shares or to convert any security into shares. Shares may be issued with such rights or 
restrictions as may be approved by resolution of the shareholders and shares may be issued on terms that they are, or at the option 
of the Company may be liable to be, redeemed. The Board may, prior to allotment, determine the terms, conditions and manner in 
which shares can be redeemed by the Company.
Committee Membership
During the year the Board decided to split the Audit & Risk Committee into two separate committees effective from August 2016. 
The members of the Audit & Risk Committee remained in post on the Audit Committee, and Mr Ball took over the chairmanship 
of the newly created Risk Committee with Mr Tracey and Mr Coumau making up the membership of that committee. On his 
appointment as chairman in January 2017 Mr Burke joined the Nomination Committee replacing his predecessor, Mr Sugden, 
and Mr Maudsley also joined that committee upon his appointment as CEO. Otherwise the membership of the board’s standing 
committees remained stable during the year.
Details of the membership of the committees as at the end of the period under review are included on page 27.
Audit Committee
The Audit Committee operates under written terms of reference which are available on the Company’s website (www.findel.co.uk) 
and is comprised of only independent non-executive directors. It is chaired by Mr Tracey. The Committee’s report is set out on 
pages 57 to 60. Corporate Governance Report I Governance

Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee operates under written terms of reference which are available on the Company’s website 
(www.findel.co.uk). It is comprised of only independent non-executive directors and Mr Grimsey is the chairman. The Committee’s 
report is set out on pages 46 to 55.
Nomination Committee
The Nomination Committee operates under written terms of reference which are available on the Company’s website 
(www.findel.co.uk) and is comprised of the Chairman, the chief executive (since his appointment in April 2017) and the independent 
non-executive directors. The committee chairman during the year was Mr Tracey, the Senior Independent Director. This reflected 
the enhanced role for the Senior Independent Director agreed by the Board during the period in which the Company operated with 
an executive chairman. Since the year end the chairmanship of the Committee passed to the Chairman, Mr Burke. The Committee’s 
report is set out on page 56.

Findel plc 
Annual report and accounts 2017
Introduction
This report has been prepared in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006 and Schedule 8 of the Large and 
Medium  sized Companies and Groups (Accounts and Reports) (Amendment) Regulations 2013. The report also meets the relevant 
requirements of the Listing Rules of the Financial Conduct Authority and describes how the Board has applied the principles of good 
governance relating to directors’ remuneration.
This policy report will be subject to a binding vote at the 2017 AGM and, if it is approved, will be effective from the date of 
approval. The policy will run until the 2020 AGM, unless a further policy is submitted for shareholder approval prior to that meeting. 
In 2016/17 we have operated under our previous remuneration policy (approved at the 2014 AGM). The policy is included in our 
2015/16 Directors’ Remuneration Report and can be accessed from our website at www.findel.co.uk.
The Annual Report on Remuneration, along with the Annual Statement from the Committee Chairman, will be put to a single 
advisory vote at the 2017 AGM. The regulations require the auditors to report to the Company’s members on the ‘auditable parts’ 
of the directors’ remuneration report and to state whether, in their opinion, the parts of the report that have been subject to audit 
have been properly prepared in accordance with the relevant legislation. The parts of this report which have been audited have been 
highlighted accordingly.
Policy on Remuneration of Executive Directors
The key objectives of the remuneration policy for Executive Directors remain:
• To provide a competitive remuneration package which will attract and retain the highest calibre of executive;
• To ensure that individual rewards and incentives are properly aligned with personal performance, the performance of the Group, 
and the interests of shareholders;
• To structure remuneration packages so a significant proportion is performance related;
• To operate simple, transparent incentive structures with a clear aim to reward for long-term shareholder value creation; and
• To set executive pay packages having had due regard to pay and employment conditions in the wider workforce.
In forming this policy the Committee has taken into account the UK Corporate Governance Code together with guidance from the 
FCA, institutional investors and investor bodies (including ISS and the Investment Association). The Committee endeavours to 
structure remuneration for Executive Directors and senior executives so that it should not raise environmental, social or governance 
(ESG) risks by inadvertently motivating irresponsible behaviour and that it should reward sustainable, long-term, performance and 
sound risk management.
The remuneration policy is reviewed regularly and the Committee is satisfied that the current policy does not encourage undue 
risk taking (e.g. due to the range of performance metrics used in incentive plans and the substantial weighting towards long-term 
performance) and that it is not in conflict with the company’s policies on internal controls that are used to manage risk more 
generally.
The Committee takes due account of remuneration structures elsewhere in the Group when setting pay for the Executive Directors 
(for example, consideration is given to the overall salary increase budget).

This policy came into effect, as a result of shareholder approval, on 18 July 2014.
Purpose and Link 
to Strategy
Operation Maximum Performance Metrics
Base Salary
To attract and 
retain high calibre 
executives.
Reviewed on an annual basis 
with increases effective from 
1 August.
Takes into account:
• pay levels in companies of 
comparable size and complexity
• skills, knowledge and 
experience of the individual;
• individual performance and 
development within the role;
• any change in responsibilities;
• rates of inflation and market 
wide wage increases in 
comparable companies; and
• pay and employment conditions 
elsewhere in the Group.
Salary levels are normally 
reviewed annually and are eligible 
for increases during the three 
year policy period.
While no maximum applies, the 
Committee will be guided by 
the salary increase budget (in 
percentage of salary terms) set 
across the workforce generally.
Increases beyond those linked 
to the workforce (in percentage 
of salary terms) may be awarded 
in certain circumstances such 
as where there is a change in 
responsibility, experience or a 
significant sustained increase in 
the scale of the role and/or size, 
value and/or complexity of the 
Group or where salary levels have 
become out of line with market 
rates for fulfilling similar roles in 
companies of comparable size 
and complexity.
A broad assessment of individual 
and corporate performance is 
considered as part of the annual 
review process.
Pension
To provide market 
competitive long-
term retirement 
benefits 
and reward 
mechanisms.
Pension benefits are typically 
provided either through 
(i) a contribution to a personal 
pension arrangement or 
(ii) a cash supplement in lieu 
of pension provision or a mix of 
both.
Only basic salary is pensionable.
The Company’s policy, other 
than in the case of legacy 
arrangements, is to limit pension 
contributions to 20% of salary.
Phil Maudsley’s company pension 
contribution is set at £83,020. 
For new directors, a pension 
contribution of up to 15% of 
salary may be made.
None. Remuneration Policy Report

Benefits
To provide 
cost effective 
employee 
benefits.
Other benefits include a 
company car or car allowance, 
fuel, private medical insurance, 
home telephone costs and any 
all employee share incentive plan 
adopted by the Company.
The Committee may elect to 
offer Executive Directors other 
employee benefits on broadly 
similar terms as other employees.
In the event that an Executive 
Director is required to relocate, 
reasonable expenses or an 
allowance may be payable.
The value of insured benefits 
may vary year-on-year based on 
the cost of providing the insured 
benefit, and is included in the 
single total figure table.
Any all-employee share incentive 
will be operated within the limits 
set by HMRC from time to time.
None.
Performance related bonus
To incentivise and 
reward for the 
achievement of 
short-term targets 
linked to the 
company’s annual 
KPIs.
A bonus is paid based on the 
achievement of performance 
conditions set at the beginning of 
the financial year.
The annual bonus is paid in 
cash although Committee may 
elect to defer a portion of the 
performance related bonus into 
Company shares for a period of 
time (to be determined by the 
Committee on award).
Clawback provisions enable the 
Committee to reclaim any bonus 
paid as a result of performance 
that is later the subject of a 
restatement of the Company’s 
results within a two-year period.
Bonus opportunity of 100% of 
salary.
Annual bonus will be earned 
based on performance against 
a subset of the Company’s key 
performance indicators.
A majority of annual bonus will 
be earned against a challenging 
graduated scale of financial 
targets (e.g. profit) with the 
targets set with reference to the 
Company’s planning for the year.
A minority of the bonus may be 
based upon the achievement of a 
number of key business objectives 
tailored to the individual executive 
(e.g. personal targets or business 
unit objectives).
For achieving the threshold 
performance targets, typically no 
more than 20% of the maximum 
bonus opportunity is payable.
Maximum payment can only be 
earned as a result of performance 
above the Company’s business 
plan for the year with a graduated 
scale operating between 
threshold and maximum 
performance levels.
The Committee will review the 
bonus outcome to ensure that 
it reflects underlying Company 
performance over the year. The 
Committee may amend the pay-
out to better reflect performance 
if it feels it is appropriate to do so. Remuneration Policy Report I Governance

long-term targets 
which support the 
business strategy.
Aligns Executives’ 
interests 
with those of 
shareholders.
Annual grant of share-based 
awards which are subject to 
performance conditions and 
normally vest three years from 
grant.
A holding period applies which 
requires all vested shares (net of 
tax) to be held by the executive 
for a period of two years.
Participants may be entitled to 
any dividends payable on vested 
shares.
Clawback provisions enable 
the Committee to reclaim any 
amount paid in the event of a 
restatement of the Company’s 
results, an error, a significant 
failure of risk management or 
gross misconduct.
PSP grants of up to 150% of 
salary (or 200% of salary in 
exceptional circumstances such 
as recruitment).
PSP awards vest subject to the 
achievement of performance 
conditions linked to Company 
strategy. The current 
performance conditions are based 
on absolute TSR and EPS growth 
targets.
If alternative measures are 
introduced in conjunction with 
or in place of EPS and TSR, 
this would be subject to prior 
consultation with major investors.
Up to 20% of an award may 
vest for threshold performance 
with full vesting taking place 
for equalling, or exceeding, the 
maximum performance targets.
The Committee will review 
the vesting outcome to ensure 
that it reflects underlying 
Company performance over 
the performance period. The 
Committee may amend the pay-
out to better reflect performance 
if it feels it is appropriate to do so.
Share ownership Guidelines
To provide a 
continued focus 
on long-term 
sustainable value 
creation and 
to further align 
executives’ and 
shareholders’ 
interests.
Executive Directors are expected 
to retain no fewer than 50% 
of any shares delivered under 
the PSP net of taxes until such 
time as their share ownership 
guideline has been achieved.
The share ownership guideline is 
currently set at 100% of salary 
for directors and this shall be kept 
under review over the life of the 
policy.

Non-Executive Director Fees
To attract and 
retain individuals 
with relevant 
experience and 
knowledge to 
enhance the 
Board.
The Committee is responsible for 
setting the Company Chairman’s 
fee. The Chairman receives a 
single fee encompassing all his 
responsibilities.
The Board as a whole (excluding 
the non-executive directors) is 
responsible for setting the level 
of remuneration for non-Executive 
Directors.
Non-executives’ fees are paid in 
cash and comprise a base fee 
and additional fees for chairing 
Board committees or holding 
the senior independent director 
role. Fee levels are reviewed 
periodically and take into account:
• skills, knowledge and 
experience of the individual;
• the expected time 
commitments, scope and 
responsibilities of each role; 
and
• market rates at companies 
of a comparable size and 
complexity.
• Non-Executive Directors are 
excluded from any discussions 
relating to their own fees.
Reasonable expenses may also 
be reimbursed.
The current fee levels will be 
eligible for increases during 
the three year period that the 
remuneration policy operates 
to ensure they continue to 
appropriately recognise the 
time commitment of the 
role, increases to fee levels 
for Non-Executive Directors 
in general and fee levels in 
companies of a similar size 
and complexity.
Non-Executives are not eligible 
to participate in any incentive 
arrangements.

Operation of the Annual Bonus Plan & LTIP Policy
The Committee will operate the annual bonus plan and PSP according to their respective rules and in accordance with the Listing 
Rules and HMRC rules where relevant. The Committee retains discretion, consistent with market practice, in a number of regards 
to the operation and administration of these plans. For example, these include the following (albeit with quantum and performance 
targets restricted to the descriptions detailed in the policy table above):
• Participants of the plans;
• The timing of grant of award and/or payment;
• The size of an award and/or a payment;
• The determination of vesting;
• Discretion required when dealing with a change of control (e.g. the timing of testing performance targets) or restructuring of the 
Group;
• Determination of a good/bad leaver for incentive plan purposes based on the rules of each plan and the appropriate treatment 
chosen;
• Adjustments required in certain circumstances (e.g. rights issues, corporate restructuring, events and special dividends); and
• The annual review of performance measures weighting, and targets for the annual bonus plan and Performance Share Plan from 
year to year.
The Committee also retains the ability to adjust the targets (up or down) and/or set different measures and alter weightings for 
the annual bonus plan and to adjust targets for the PSP if events occur (e.g. material divestment of a Group business or events 
relating to the Company’s issued share capital) which cause it to determine that the conditions are no longer appropriate in the 
circumstances and the amendment is required so that the conditions achieve their original purpose and are not, in the opinion of the 
Committee, materially more or less challenging to satisfy in the circumstances.
All historic PSP awards that were granted but remain outstanding (detailed on page 52 of the Annual Report on Remuneration) 
remain eligible to vest based on their original award terms.
Choice of performance measures and approach to target setting
The performance metrics that are used for annual bonus and long-term incentive plan are a subset of the Group’s key performance 
indicators.
Under the annual bonus plan, reflecting the Company’s focus on delivering profitable growth and generating cash in its businesses, 
the majority of bonus is subject currently to the achievement of challenging profit and free cash flow targets.
In addition to challenging financial targets, a minority of bonus may be set subject to business objectives tailored to each individual’s 
role and responsibilities (e.g. individual targets are set to provide reward opportunity for delivering specific in-year objectives) the 
achievement of which will enable the Company to maintain or improve its upward trajectory in delivering against its business plans.
In terms of long-term performance targets, outstanding awards currently vest subject to (i) challenging EPS growth targets that 
are aligned with the long-term levels of earnings growth targeted by the Company and (ii) absolute share price targets which 
provide clear alignment of interests between shareholders and executives in terms of delivering successful progress in the Group’s 
businesses. New measures which are aligned to the Company’s medium to long term strategy may be introduced and will be 
subject to prior consultation with leading investors.
Targets are generally set based on graduated scales that take account of internal planning and external market expectations for 
the Company. Only modest rewards are available for delivering threshold performance levels with maximum rewards requiring 
substantial out-performance of the challenging plans approved at the start of each year over one and up to three year time periods. Remuneration Policy Report

How Executive Directors’ remuneration policy relates to the wider Group
The remuneration policy described in the policy table provides an overview of the structure that operates for Executive Directors.
Outside the Executive Director population, different structures and incentive quantum apply that take due account of the Company’s 
overall remuneration policy, the specific objectives of individual’s roles and practice in companies of comparable size.
Base salaries for employees are set by reference to industry specific comparator groups. Consideration is given to the overall salary 
increase budget and general employment conditions, when setting Executive Director base salaries.
The performance-related bonus scheme operates with targets and quantum that are set by reference to individual role and 
responsibility. More emphasis on divisional performance and/or personal performance is included at less senior levels.
The PSP is offered on a discretionary annual basis to senior executives. Awards are limited to this grade of employees as they are 
anticipated as having the most potential to influence performance at a Group level. These awards are generally subject to the same 
performance conditions as detailed in the remuneration policy table, although awards to divisional executives are also subject to 
specific divisional performance conditions and underpins.
How employee’s views are taken into account
The Committee does not directly consult with employees on executive remuneration.
However, the Committee is provided with an overview of employee and executive remuneration structures at the Company. The 
Committee is kept up to date, more generally, with pay and employment conditions elsewhere in the Company and is informed of 
the salary increase budget for the Group as a whole when setting Executive Directors’ pay increases (if any) each year.
How shareholders views are taken into account
As a matter of course, after the AGM, the Committee will consider feedback from shareholders and relevant guidance from 
shareholder representative bodies. The Committee will also seek feedback from shareholders from time to time as part of a wider 
shareholder dialogue if considered appropriate. This feedback is then considered as part of the Committee’s ongoing review of 
remuneration policy.
Illustration of application of policy
The Company’s policy results in a significant portion of remuneration received by executive directors being dependent on Company 
performance. The graph below illustrates how the total pay opportunities for the Chief Executive vary under three different 
performance scenarios: below threshold, on-target and maximum. When reviewing the charts that follow, it should be noted that 
these have been prepared based on the policy detailed in the table above but ignoring the potential impact of future share price 
growth.

Assumptions
• Below threshold – fixed pay only being 2017/18 base salary, the value of 2016/17 benefits and 2017/18 pension contribution
• Target – fixed pay plus 50% of 2017/18 bonus payable and 25% vesting of 2017 PSP award
• Maximum – fixed pay plus 100% of 2017/18 bonus payable and 100% vesting of 2017 PSP award
Assumes 2017 PSP award of 100% of salary and ignores potential share price growth.
Recruitment and Promotion Policy
For Executive Director recruitment and promotion situations the Committee will use the following guidelines:
Remuneration Element Policy
Base Salary Base salary levels will be set by reference to the experience of the individual, taking into account 
relevant market data and internal relativities.
If a new recruit has a below market salary set on appointment, they may experience phased 
multi-period increases in excess of other Executive Directors (and the wider workforce) to bring 
them into line with the market as they develop in the role, subject to continued performance in 
post.
Benefits Benefits as provided to current Executive Directors. Where necessary the Committee may 
approve the payment of relocation expenses to facilitate recruitment and flexibility is retained for 
the Company to pay for legal fees and other costs incurred by the individual in relation to their 
appointment.
Pension A defined contribution or cash supplement limited to 15% of salary.
Annual Bonus The maximum ongoing incentive opportunity under the Company’s policy is 100% of salary.
The annual bonus will operate as outlined for current executives, with the respective maximum 
opportunity, albeit pro-rated for the period of employment.
Dependent on the timing of the appointment and the nature of the role, it may be necessary to 
set different performance measures and targets for the first year of operation.
Long-Term Incentives PSP awards will be granted in line with the policy outlined for the current Executive Directors.
An award may be made shortly after an appointment (subject to the Company not being in a 
prohibited period). The maximum ongoing annual award level is 150% of salary under the PSP 
but an award, in exceptional circumstances (as determined by the Committee), may be granted 
up to 200% of salary under the rules of the PSP.
For an internal hire, existing awards would continue over their original vesting period and remain 
subject to their terms as at the date of grant.
Buy-out Awards To facilitate an external hire, the Committee may be required to offer additional cash and/or 
share-based elements which includes the use of awards made under 9.4.2 of the Listing Rules. 
Any such payments would be made to compensate for remuneration forfeit when leaving a 
former employer or role and would take into account where possible, the type of remuneration 
forfeit, the time horizon to vesting and the impact of any performance conditions.
The Committee will make an announcement to shareholders, detailing the remuneration 
arrangements, at the time of appointment. Remuneration Policy Report

Service Contracts & External Appointments
Executive Directors
Future Contract Policy
It is the Committee’s policy that service agreements for Executive Directors should be terminable on not more than 12 months’ 
notice which is in line with current market practice. Contracts will not include liquidated damages clauses guaranteeing a specified 
level of remuneration on termination. Contracts will, at the Company’s discretion, enable the Company to make a payment in lieu of 
notice comprising up to 12 monthly instalments of base salary which would reduce to the extent that alternative employment was 
taken up.
The Committee will retain discretion, on appointment of a new Executive Director, to agree a service contract with a 24 month 
notice period (e.g. in the event that the Company was the subject of takeover speculation) which would reduce on a monthly basis 
during the first 12 months of appointment to a 12 month notice period or less. While this provision is not considered part of ‘normal’ 
policy, it is considered appropriate to retain flexibility should exceptional circumstances arise which would be detailed in the Annual 
Report on Remuneration at the relevant time.
New contracts will not provide enhanced protection in relation to contractual terms on a change of control.
Service Contracts of Executive Directors
The service contract of Mr Maudsley dated 6 October 1997 (amended 18 January 2011) was amended on 5 April 2017 to reflect 
his promotion to Chief Executive. Mr Maudsley’s contract contains a 12 month notice period from either party until 31 March 2018, 
after which time it reduces to a 6 month notice period from either party. There are no express provisions included in the contract 
on termination other than the Company may require the employee to remain away from work during his notice period during which 
time he would continue to be remunerated.
Mr Kowalski left the Board on 5 April 2017. His service contract, dated 2 October 2010, was subject to one year’s rolling notice by 
either party. In the event of termination of employment, the Company could elect to make up to 12 monthly payments to the value 
of base salary and benefits that may cease, at the discretion of the Company, to the extent that alternative employment is taken up. 
Full details of his termination arrangements are provided on page 53.
General provisions
In certain circumstances such as gross misconduct, the Company may terminate employment immediately without notice or 
payment for each of the current or future Executive Directors. In the event of early termination of a service agreement, the 
Committee would consider appropriate use of mitigation and phased compensation payments where possible. In addition, any 
statutory entitlements or payments to settle or compromise claims in connection with a termination of any existing or future 
Executive Director would be made as necessary. The Committee also retains the discretion to meet any outplacement costs 
if deemed necessary.
Unless the Committee determines otherwise, annual bonuses are not normally payable if an Executive Director has left or is 
under notice at the payment date. Any annual bonus payments would normally only be made to an Executive Director who has 
left or is under notice if the Committee determines him a ‘good leaver’ (e.g. death, injury or disability, redundancy, serious long-
term illness, transfer or sale of the employing company, retirement with the Company’s agreement or other circumstances at the 
discretion of the Committee), in which case a bonus entitlement would be calculated based on the period of active employment and 
performance.
The treatment for share-based incentives previously granted to an Executive Director will be determined based on the relevant plan 
rules. The default treatment will be for outstanding awards to lapse on cessation of employment.
However, in relation to awards granted under the PSP (approved by shareholders at the 2016 AGM), in certain prescribed ‘good 
leaver’ circumstances (e.g. death, injury or disability, redundancy, serious long-term illness, transfer or sale of the employing 
company, retirement with the Company’s agreement or other circumstances at the discretion of the Committee) awards may 
remain eligible to vest subject to performance conditions, which will be measured over the original performance period or up to the 
date of cessation, with time pro-rating applied unless the Committee considers it inappropriate to do so. Remuneration Policy Report I Governance

Outside appointments
The Company currently allows the Executive Directors to undertake outside interests and appointments, subject to the prior 
approval of the Board, in which instances they are allowed to retain any fees that they receive in respect of such activities. 
Mr Burke is a director of The Rank Group Plc and there were no other such arrangements in place during the period under review.
Non-Executive Directors
The appointment of Non-Executive Directors is for an initial period of three years, subject to review and re-election in General 
Meeting. They do not have service agreements.
Ian Burke joined as Executive Chairman on 12 January 2017 under a service agreement dated 16 December 2016. The employment 
was subject to a 6 month notice period from either party. Ian Burke subsequently became Non-Executive Chairman on 5 April 
2017 and his service agreement was terminated by mutual consent and without compensation. This was replaced by a letter of 
appointment, dated 5 April 2017 which includes an initial term of 3 years, unless terminated by either party giving one months’ 
notice.
The Letter of Appointment for Mr Tracey is dated 11 November 2009; for Mr Grimsey, 30 January 2012; for Mr Coumau, 2 August 2013; 
for Mr Greg Ball, 16 February 2016.
Mr Tracey’s letter of appointment entitles him to 3 months’ notice of termination. The letters of appointment of the other 
Non-Executive Directors are terminable at will. Save for any payment of fees in lieu of notice to Mr Tracey there is no entitlement 
to compensation for loss of office in connection with the termination of the services of the Non-Executive Directors.
The service contracts for Chief Executive and letters of appointment for the Chairman and the Non-Executive Directors are available 
for inspection at the Company’s registered office during normal business hours and at the AGM (for 15 minutes prior to the meeting 
and during the meeting). Governance I Board Report on Directors’ Remuneration

Findel plc 
Annual report and accounts 2017
Dear Shareholder
On behalf of the Board, I am pleased to present the Directors’ Remuneration Report for the year ended 31 March 2017.
The previous Findel Remuneration Policy was approved by shareholders in 2014 and had a three year life. In preparation for this, 
the Remuneration Committee carried out a comprehensive review of remuneration and is putting forward a revised remuneration 
policy to shareholders at the AGM to be held on 29 August 2017. If it is approved, the intention is for the policy to operate over the 
next three year period to 2020. Further details of the review that was undertaken is provided below. As usual, there will also be an 
advisory vote on the remainder of the remuneration report.
This report comprises
• this Annual Statement;
• the proposed Directors’ Remuneration Policy for FY2017-2019; and
• the Annual Report on Remuneration, which explains how we applied our policy in 2016/2017 and how we intend to apply the 
new policy 2017/18.
Performance and Remuneration for 2016/17
As detailed in the Strategic Report, FY17 has been a challenging year for Findel Education with strong revenue and customer 
number growth from Express Gifts, however, after taking into account a number of individual significant items the net profit is lower 
than expectations.
Our FY17 performance related bonus was subject to Profit Before Tax (PBT) targets and non-financial objectives relating to business 
transformation, treating customers fairly and personal objectives.
Despite management’s efforts, and reflecting the level of stretch in our target setting process, the threshold level of profit was not 
met. Whilst a number of key strategic objectives were completed successfully, the Committee determined that no bonus would be 
payable to Executive Directors.
With regards to our longer-term performance, the Performance Share Plan (“PSP”) awards which were granted on 20 June 2014 
were eligible to vest in 2017. These awards were subject to an equal blend of EPS growth and share price appreciation targets. 
In summary the absolute share price targets ranged from 390p to 510p, and EPS targets ranged from 40p to 50p (based on 
performance in 2016/17). The share price achieved for the purposes of testing against the condition was 199.3p and so this element 
of the award lapsed in full as a result of the threshold share price target not being met. The adjusted EPS for the year ended 
31 March 2017 was 20.19p and as the threshold target was not met this element of the award also lapsed in full.
This performance meant that the stretching performance conditions attached to the 2014 long-term incentive plan award have not 
been met and accordingly these awards will lapse.
Proposed Directors’ Remuneration Policy
During the year the Committee reviewed the Directors’ Remuneration Policy which will be subject to a binding vote at the coming 
AGM. The Committee felt that the policy was, in general, operating well but has made some changes in response to best practice 
and shareholder preferences:
• The policy has been made more flexible (for example on the choice of performance measures) to enable the Committee to make 
changes over the life of the policy to align with Company strategy; and
• Recovery and withholding provisions on variable pay and a two-year holding period on the long-term incentive (both already in 
operation) have been added to the policy.
The Committee’s policy remains to set remuneration at an appropriate level to retain and motivate executives of the appropriate 
calibre to deliver the Company’s strategy. Supporting the Company’s current phase of development and strategy, remuneration is 
clearly biased towards performance-related elements that are aligned with continued delivery of improved levels of profitable growth 
and thus returns to our shareholders.

Changes to the Board
On 12 January 2017 we welcomed Ian Burke as Executive Chairman, replacing David Sugden who stood down following seven 
years as Chairman of the Group. Mr Burke’s remuneration package on joining the Board comprised a base salary of £250,000 p.a. 
only. Mr Sugden ceased to be a director on 12 January 2017 and remained an employee of the Company until 31 January 2017. 
Mr Sugden did not receive any payments for loss of office, he received no bonus in respect of the portion of 2016/17 he worked 
and he did not participate in the Company’s PSP.
On 6th April 2017 we announced the appointment of Phil Maudsley as Chief Executive (previously Mr Maudsley was MD, Home 
Shopping). He receives a base salary of £420,000 reflecting his change in role. His bonus opportunity will remain at a maximum 
of 100% of salary and he will receive a PSP award with a face value of 100% of salary in 2017.
Following the appointment of Phil Maudsley as CEO, Ian Burke assumed the role of Non-Executive Chairman and now receives 
a fee of £150,000 p.a. On the same date, we also announced that Tim Kowalski would be standing down from his role as Finance 
Director after seven years with the Company. As part of Mr Kowalski’s departure terms, which are consistent with the remuneration 
policy, he will receive monthly payments equal to 12 months’ salary and benefits which will be subject to a reduction if alternative 
employment is found. Mr Kowalski will receive no bonus in respect of 2016/17 and his outstanding PSP awards have lapsed.
Performance metrics
To align with the Company’s strategy to minimise debt, free cash flow has been added as a performance measure for the FY18 
performance related bonus. The total portion of the bonus subject to financial performance conditions will be increased to 75% 
(from 60%) with an equal weighting (37.5%) for both Group Profit before Tax and Group Free Cash Flow. The final 25% will 
be based on performance against pre-agreed personal objectives. Any pay-out under the bonus (including for the non-financial 
elements) is subject to Group PBT being above the threshold target and there being no material incidence of bad behavior in relation 
to Treating Customers Fairly during the year.
Consistent with previous years, the 2017 PSP award will be subject to financial performance conditions with 50% of awards tied to 
EPS targets and 50% to absolute share price hurdles.
On behalf of the Board, I would like to thank shareholders for their continued backing and look forward to your support of our 
remuneration policy at the 2017 AGM.

Annual Report on Remuneration
Remuneration Committee
The remuneration of the Executive Directors and the Chairman is determined by the Committee.
The members of the Committee during the year were all independent non-Executive Directors. Mr Grimsey chaired the Committee 
throughout the year and Messrs. Coumau and Tracey were members. No member of the Committee has any personal financial 
interest, other than as a shareholder, in the matters to be decided, nor any potential conflict of interest arising from cross-directorships, 
nor any day-to-day involvement in running the business throughout the period.
The Chairman of the Company normally attends meetings of the Committee by invitation except when matters concerning his own 
remuneration are discussed. Following the appointment of Mr Maudsley as CEO and Mr Burke taking up a non-executive chairman 
role it is expected that both will attend the Committee’s meetings when not conflicted. The Committee is assisted when required 
by New Bridge Street (a trading name of AON plc) who are appointed by the Committee, are members of the Remuneration 
Consultants Group and have signed up to its Code of Conduct. Apart from providing advice in respect of the design, establishment 
and operation of remuneration arrangements, New Bridge Street provides no other services to the Company and during the year 
charged fees of £139,915 (excluding VAT) (FY16: £132,061).
The Company Secretary acts as the secretary to the Committee.
The Committee meets three or more times a year and met 10 times in 2016/17. Individual attendance details can be found 
within the Corporate Governance Report on page 33. The Committee’s terms of reference are available on the Company’s 
website (www.findel.co.uk). During the year the key matters which were discussed were:
• The salary levels of the Executive Directors;
• The bonus out-turn for the 2015/16 annual bonuses;
• The terms of the 2016/17 annual bonus plan;
• The quantum and performance targets for the 2016/17 Performance Share Plan awards;
• Testing of the 2013 Performance Share Plan award’s performance targets;
• Approval of remuneration changes and the remuneration of new appointments of any employee within the remit of the 
Committee;
• Review of the 2017-2020 Directors’ Remuneration Policy;
• Review of the regulator guidance on remuneration;
• Approval of 2015/16 Directors’ Remuneration Report;
• Initial design of the 2017/18 annual bonus plan
• The annual self-evaluation of the effectiveness of the Committee; and
• Consideration of developments in best practice.
Non-Executive Directors’ Fees
In 2016/17 the Non-Executive Director base fee was £37,500 with the additional fees payable for the position of Senior Independent 
Director and Chairmanship of a Board Committee as follows:
• Senior Independent Director fee: £20,000;
• Chairman of the Audit Committee fee: £10,000;
• Chairman of the Risk Committee fee: £10,000; and
• Chairman of the Remuneration Committee fee: £10,000.
Until 1 August, there was a single Audit & Risk Committee and since that date, two separate Audit and Risk Committees were 
established.
The fee for the Senior Independent Director was increased to reflect additional responsibilities carried out in lieu of a Non-Executive 
Chairman, including but not limited to the chairmanship of the Nomination Committee. Following the appointment of Phil Maudsley 
as Chief Executive, Ian Burke became Non-Executive Chairman (from Executive Chairman) with effect from 6 April 2017 and his fee 
was set at £150,000 p.a. On 1st May 2017 Mr Burke took over the chairmanship of the Nominations Committee and as a result the 
fee for the Senior Independent Director reverted to £10,000. Board Report on Directors’ Remuneration I Governance

Performance Graph
The following graphs contrast the total shareholder return of the Company with the FTSE Small Cap Index and FTSE All Share 
General Retailers Index. These indices were selected as being, in the opinion of the Committee, the most appropriate for 
comparison because Findel is currently a constituent member of each.
The first graph shows the total shareholder return over the eight financial years to 31 March 2017 as required by the reporting 
requirements. However, the Committee considers that the total shareholder return over the six financial years to 31 March 2017 
to be a relevant additional disclosure since this timeframe relates to the period during which the 2016/17 executive team were 
executing the Board’s recovery and growth strategy for the Group.

Annual report and accounts 2017
2016/17 Annual bonus (subject to audit)
The 2016/17 performance related bonus plan maximum was 100% of salary for both the Finance Director and MD, Home Shopping.
Messrs. Sugden and Kowalski stepped down from the Board on 12 January and 5 April 2017 respectively and did not receive a bonus 
in respect of 2016/17.
With regards to the proportion of the total bonus that could be earned against each element, 60% of the maximum opportunity was 
based on profit performance (split as 40% based on Express Gifts operating profit and 20% on Group profit before tax in the case of 
the MD, Home Shopping), with 15% based on business transformation targets, 15% on treating customer fairly outcomes and 10% 
on individually tailored strategic targets.
The non-financial targets were subject to an underpin of threshold profitability. In addition, the entire bonus was also subject to 
a further underpin that enables the Committee to scale back the bonus (including to zero) if there were any material instances of 
inappropriate outcomes for customers.
Performance against targets
The 2016/17 profit targets were:
Profit Performance   Threshold Max
Group profit before tax*   £25.75m £29.45m
Express Gifts operating profit**   £37.25m £45.10m
* Group profit before tax is stated before exceptional items and fair value movements on foreign currency derivative financial instruments
** The Express Gifts annual operating profit figures used in the plan exclude the allocation of central PLC costs and are stated before exceptional items
Based on actual figures of £22.2m for Group adjusted profit before tax and £30.4m for Express Gifts adjusted operating profit, the 
threshold targets were not met. No payments will therefore be made with respect of FY2016/17.
Non-financial objectives
Executive Directors had objectives relating to regulatory compliance, Findel’s Customer Transformation Project, cashflow, 
development of an updated bad debt model, a roll out of a finance software system and organisational effectiveness.
Achievement against these objectives was assessed by the Committee based on demonstrated progress against agreed 
milestones.
The personal objectives for the CEO in respect of his period as MD, Home Shopping were partially achieved in that (i) he oversaw 
the granting of full FCA permission for Express Gifts to continue to carry out its consumer credit activities; (ii) limited progress was 
made in delivering the Express Gifts customer transformation programme and work will continue in this area; (iii) some progress 
was made during the year in the development of a new bad debt model for the business; and (iv) management changes within 
the finance area immediately after the end of the year and the appointment of a Deputy MD of Express Gifts during the year were 
important steps towards the management development goals set. However (v) the delayed roll out of the new Financier software 
system and (vi) cash flow management has made these matters top priorities in 2017/18. The Finance Director shared objectives (i) 
to (iv) and (vi) with the MD, Home Shopping. In addition he was tasked with consolidating certain Group and divisional head office 
functions and limited progress was made in that respect within the year.
Despite progress against certain objectives, in light of the financial performance noted above (i.e. failure to meet the threshold profit 
target), no bonuses were payable notwithstanding the progress achieved against the non-financial targets noted above.
Directors’ pension entitlements (subject to audit)
No director was a member of a defined benefit scheme during FY2017. Mr Maudsley previously participated in the Findel Group 
Pension Fund but elected to transfer his benefits out of the scheme in December 2015.
Directors’ Share Options and Long-Term Incentive Plans (subject to audit)
Awards vesting in relation to FY2016/17
The performance conditions for the awards granted in 2014 were an equal blend of EPS growth (before exceptional items) and 
share price appreciation targets. In summary the absolute share price targets range from 390p to 510p, and EPS targets range from 
40.0p to 50.0p.
The average share price for the three months to 31 March 2017 was 199.3p. This was below the threshold target so this element 
of the awards lapsed in full. The Company’s adjusted EPS of 20.19p resulted in this element of the awards also lapsing in full.
The performance against targets was assessed by independent consultants (with appropriate liaison between the Audit and 
Remuneration Committees). Board Report on Directors’ Remuneration

Mr Kowalski stepped down from the Board on 5 April 2017 and the above award has lapsed. No award was made to the MD, Home 
Shopping in view of the enhanced award that was made to him in FY2015/16 or to the Executive Chairman (who was not eligible for 
LTIP awards).
As set out in the FY2015/16 report, the award was subject to Absolute TSR growth (50% of the award) and EPS targets (50% 
of the award). EPS remains the primary measure of our long-term financial success with TSR providing clear alignment with 
shareholders. Targets for the FY2016/17 grants are:
Annual Compound Growth in TSR Annual Compound Growth in EPS Percentage of Shares 
(to 31 March 2019 from the 31 March 2016 base year) (to 31 March 2019 from the 31 March 2016 base year) subject to the Award that vests
Below 15% p.a. Below 15% p.a. 0%
15% p.a. 15% p.a.  20%
Between 15% and 25% p.a. Between 15% and 25% p.a. Between 20% and 100% 
  on a straight-line basis
Above 25% p.a. Above 25% p.a. 100%
TSR is measured based on a three month averaging at the start and the end of the performance period. The above ranges of targets 
were calibrated after taking into account both internal and external growth expectations such that they are felt to provide a balance 
between being realistic at the bottom end of the range and very demanding at the top end of the range (e.g. the absolute TSR 
targets maximum performance requirement at 25% p.a. growth, which remains above the typical upper quartile performance level 
required to achieve full vesting in a relative TSR condition against a general Index such as the FTSE Small Cap).
The award was also subject to an underpin that are no material incidences of bad behaviour of any employee within the Company’s 
group in relation to “treating customers fairly” during the Performance Period. When assessing the outcome of the performance the 
Committee would also have had regard to the overall performance of the Group and have had the discretion to reduce the award 
(including to zero) if it felt that the outcome did not reflect underlying performance.
A two-year holding period would have applied to any vested shares.

26 June 2017 Governance I Nomination Committee Report
56
Findel plc 
Annual report and accounts 2017
The Nomination Committee operates under written terms of reference which are available on the Company’s website 
(www.findel.co.uk). Its principal duties are to periodically review the composition of the Board and to recommend suitable 
candidates for approval by the Board to fill executive and non-executive vacancies.
During the year the Committee comprised the Chairman and the independent non-executive directors. The committee chairman 
was Mr Tracey, the Senior Independent Director. This reflected the enhanced role for the Senior Independent Director agreed by 
the Board during the period in which the Company operated with an executive chairman. Since the year end Mr Burke has taken 
up the position of non-executive Chairman of the Company and has taken over the chairmanship of the Nomination Committee.
The general approach of the Committee in relation to Board appointments is to engage external recruitment specialists to carry 
out a search for appropriate candidates. Committee members meet a short list of candidates before discussing and agreeing 
a recommended candidate to the Board. Where there are appropriate internal candidates they are included in the external 
assessment process.
The Board has adopted a policy on Board diversity which recognises that diversity (including but not restricted to gender) is an 
important factor in ensuring that the profile of Board members provides the necessary range of perspectives and skill-sets to ensure 
effective stewardship.
The majority of the Committee’s work during FY2017 has focused upon the appointment of a new Chairman for the Group 
following Mr Sugden’s indication in February 2016 that he planned to retire from the Board at the conclusion of the 2016 Annual 
General Meeting. The Committee appointed The Zygos Partnership to assist in this process. However, the uncertainty created by 
discussions with major shareholders regarding the potential appointment of Mr Mike Ashley as Chairman, which ultimately did not 
take place, resulted in Mr Sugden agreeing to remain in his position beyond the AGM. Zygos resumed its work in the autumn of 
2016 and in December 2016 the Board confirmed the appointment of Ian Burke as Chairman with effect from 12 January 2017.
The other primary area of focus for the Committee in the second half of the year was upon the balance of the Board, succession 
planning and a return to a more conventional Board structure with a separate non-executive chairman and a CEO. This process led 
to the appointment of Mr Maudsley as CEO in April 2017, with Mr Burke moving to a non-executive chairman role.
At the same time the Board also announced the departure of the Group Finance Director, Tim Kowalski, from the Group. The 
Committee recommended the appointment of Stuart Caldwell (previously the Group Financial Controller) as Acting CFO but without 
a seat on the Board, and is well advanced in its search for a permanent replacement Finance Director.
During the year the Committee undertook an evaluation of its effectiveness using external consultants, Armstrong Bonham Carter. 
It also reviewed the performance and commitment of the directors, all of whom are to be proposed for election/re-election at the 
2017 annual general meeting and reported to the Board that it should recommend those elections/re-elections to shareholders. It 
has also concluded that Mr Burke was independent at the time of his appointment and on the change of his status to non-executive 
chairman notwithstanding his short period of executive service which the Board considers to be a very short-term transitionary 
period and in respect of which he did not participate in any incentive plans.
The Committee met on seven occasions during FY2017. It plans to hold at least two scheduled meetings during the coming year.

Audit Committee Report
On behalf of the Committee, I am pleased to present this year’s Audit Committee Report, which provides an overview of how we, 
as a Committee, have discharged our responsibilities, setting out the significant issues we have reviewed and concluded on in the 
year. As noted in last year’s Annual Report, the Audit and Risk Committee was split into separate Audit and Risk Committees during 
the year.
This report focuses mainly on:
• Committee governance;
• The key risks facing the business; 
• Our focus since the last annual report, including the impact of changes in the UK corporate governance regime;
• Internal controls; and
• The operation of the internal and external audit functions.
Committee Governance
The Audit Committee operates under written terms of reference, which were reviewed during the year and are available on the 
company’s website (www.findel.co.uk).
The committee is comprised of three independent non-executive directors. Brief biographical details of the committee members, 
including their expertise and experience, are set out on page 27 and the number of meetings and attendance are set out on page 33. 
The executive directors, the chairman of the board and the head of internal audit attended each meeting by invitation. Divisional 
executives were also invited to meetings during the year in relation to some of the specific matters under review listed below. 
The external auditors also attended all meetings. 
The committee has not used its powers to engage external advisers other than those appointed in conjunction with management 
in the year under review. Private meetings are held at least twice a year with the external auditor and with the Head of Internal 
Audit.  In these meetings the committee probed the efficiency and effectiveness of the internal and external audit, including the 
co-operation received by the auditors, recommendations for improvements to processes and timeliness of addressing control and 
process recommendations.
The committee’s agenda is linked to events in the Company’s financial calendar and its assessment of key business risk as well as 
other matters for review recommended by the Board and the Remuneration Committee in their meetings. The effectiveness of the 
Committee is assessed as part of the annual Board and Committee effectiveness review, further detail on which is contained in the 
report on corporate governance on pages 32 to 35.
Our focus since the last annual report – accounting and audit
The most significant matters relating to the annual accounts considered were:
(a) Recoverability of trade receivables in Express Gifts Limited;
(b) Financial services redress provisions;
(c) Recoverability of goodwill and unamortised intangible assets;
(d) Individually significant items; and
(e) Carrying amount of inventories.
The committee received a paper from the Acting CFO supporting his judgements in each of these areas and another report 
from the external auditors setting out their opinions and subjective assessments of the level of prudence involved in the key 
judgements. The committee challenged the robustness of these proposals. In all cases, the committee was guided by the 
overriding mantras of “fair, balanced and understandable” and “true and fair view”. Audit Committee Report
Governance I Audit Committee Report

Findel plc 
Annual report and accounts 2017
The particular challenges by the committee in relation to the matters listed above were:
(a) Receivables provisioning – In light of the decision to develop a new bad debt provisioning model to provide a more robust and 
granular assessment of potential loss, we needed to challenge whether the new model’s output was based upon appropriate 
assumptions and methodologies to comply with applicable accounting standards and industry best practice. Was the accounting 
treatment of the impact of the adoption of the new model appropriate? Were the reasons for the changes between the output 
of the two models reasonable?
 Were changes in Express Gifts’ approach to the management of debt sales and customers with whom forbearance 
arrangements have been agreed appropriately reflected in the provision for doubtful debts? The committee received satisfactory 
responses to all these challenges.
 Following the adoption of the new bad debt model during FY17, there has been an increase in the impairment provision at 
March 2017. The Committee challenged management as to whether this adjustment should be recognised as a prior period 
adjustment in accordance with IAS 8. As the additional provision has arisen from the development of the new model during the 
year, and is based on information which was not available to the Group in prior years, management has recognised the increase 
in the provision in the current year. Due to the scale of the charge, however, and as the charge does not relate to the current 
trading period, management has concluded that the additional charge should be separately disclosed as an individually significant 
item in the income statement.  The Committee was satisfied with management’s responses.
(b) Financial Services redress provisioning – had the review of legacy processes within Express Gifts been robust in identifying the 
areas of system or operation flaws which may have resulted in customer detriment? Where detriment had been established, 
and especially where changes in earlier estimates has been made, were the forecast assumptions underpinning the calculation 
of provisions appropriate, in the light of both the Company’s data collection and the interactions of the Company with the FCA? 
Do the draft financial statements adequately explain why previous estimates have had to be revised? The committee received 
satisfactory responses to these challenges.
(c) Goodwill and Intangible asset recoverability – In light of the deteriorating medium-term outlook for the educational resources 
market, was the proposal to impair the carrying value of goodwill and intangible assets of the Education CGU by £19.8m 
reasonable? The committee received satisfactory responses to its challenges.
(d) Individually significant items – were the items truly individually significant in nature? Had all individually significant charges and 
credits been disclosed? Were the disclosures sufficient? The committee concluded that all individually significant items were 
appropriate and consistent with the financial statements showing a true and fair view of the financial performance for the year.
(e) Stock provisioning – were the stock provisions adequate given the Company’s plans for reducing the volume of slow moving 
items and the continued increase in the proportion of clothing sold by Express Gifts? The committee was satisfied with the 
responses to its challenges.
The committee also considered:
(f) at the planning stage of the audit, how the auditors defined and applied materiality in their audit. The committee was satisfied 
with the responses.
(g) towards the conclusion of the audit, the materiality of adjusted and unadjusted errors as reported by the external auditors to 
the committee – what caused them? What did they imply for levels of control and how did they impact our view on the annual 
report as a whole? The committee concluded that appropriate adjustments and disclosures had been made;
(h) the going concern assessment – the committee was satisfied with the responses to its questions about how the Group could 
manage various sensitivities to the central estimates;
(i) the viability statement – the committee approved the choice of three years as the period over which to assess viability and 
examined the extent of contingency built into the second and third years of the forward projections, the key risks or threats 
to the Group’s viability and the amount of disclosure proposed around the key risks. The committee was satisfied with the 
responses received; and
(j) the overall level of prudence in the accounts – how consistent were the judgements and assessments with the equivalent 
judgements and assessments of the previous year? Were the key judgements and assessments consistent with the Board 
discussions of the businesses’ performance throughout the year and with the conclusions of the Board’s annual strategic 
review? The committee was satisfied on each of these points.
In reviewing the annual report on behalf of the Board and making recommendations that were adopted by the Board in relation to 
the overall “fair, balanced and understandable” test, the committee considered the report in the light of the tone and content of 
papers presented to the Board over the year by the Chairman, business heads and the Finance Director, and assessed the balance 
of positive and negative comments on each business in the light of the business’s performance for the year.
The committee also considered and accepted management’s review of Group accounting policies. Audit Committee Report I Governance

Annual report and accounts 2017
Our focus since the last annual report – internal control
The committee has responsibility for the regular review of the Group’s system of internal control and its effectiveness and reports 
its findings to the Board. It is the role of management to implement the Board’s policies on risk and control through the design and 
operation of appropriate internal control systems. Operating management is charged with the ongoing responsibility for identifying 
risks facing each of the operating units and for putting in place procedures to mitigate, manage and monitor risks. The system of 
internal control is designed to manage rather than eliminate the risk of failing to achieve business objectives and can provide only 
reasonable and not absolute assurance against material misstatement or loss.
Management uses a ‘three lines of defence’ approach, where the first line of defence is in the management of the business units, 
who are responsible for ensuring that a robust risk and control environment is established as part of their daily operations. The 
second line of defence is provided by the oversight functions within the business and at Group level, setting policies, procedures, 
and compliance and governance frameworks. The third line of defence is the internal and external auditors who offer independent 
challenge to the levels of assurance provided by the business operations and oversight functions.
The separation of the previous Audit & Risk Committee into two allows a greater level of focus to be placed upon risk management, 
as discussed in that Committee’s report.
In the year since the last annual report, the committee has also monitored and challenged:
(a) how the Group’s businesses were dealing with the challenges of the digitalisation of aspects of their interfaces with suppliers 
and customers, the changes in customer buying behaviour and the adequacy of the businesses’ defences against cyber-attack; 
(b) the ongoing assurance programme in Express Gifts around ensuring a steady journey towards compliance with all of the core 
principles of the FCA licence as new systems are brought on stream;
(c) the progress on the level of change required in processes and behaviours and the performance measurement and staff appraisal 
systems necessary to ensure appropriate behaviours towards customers in accordance with the FCA requirements;
(d) the risk of customer fraud at both our businesses and the tools required to identify and mitigate against this;
(e) a review of systems access in relation to data protection requirements and the actions required to mitigate the risks in this area;
(f) a review of project management across all aspects of the businesses; and
(g) the treating of staff fairly, especially in the use of zero hours contracts.
The committee used the experience and expertise of its members to meet with management outside of committee meetings to 
ensure that their experience was available to management. In relation to all of these matters the committee also had presentations 
from the Express Gifts management team, at which plans were reviewed and challenged, noting that a significant amount of work 
was still required to achieve the level of behavioural change, understanding of the interaction between product and financial services 
policies and efficiency desired by the Board. The committee reviewed the significant changes in organisation and personnel within 
Express Gifts as key elements of the plan to achieve greater regulatory resilience. The committee noted that Express Gifts had 
improved its IT security over the last year to further mitigate the risk of cyber-attacks and were extending training to its staff on 
recognising cyber threats as they develop.
The committee oversees the adequacy of Findel’s whistleblowing arrangements, ensuring that they are proportionate for the 
Group and enable staff and contractors to raise concerns, in confidence, about possible wrongdoing in financial reporting or other 
matters. The committee considered a report on the whistleblowing arrangements within the Group and an overview of instances of 
whistleblowing. The Chairman of the committee also received his annual report on the service by the independent external service 
provider and no issues were raised. The service was extended during the year to cover all aspects of the business.
The committee has conducted its annual review of the effectiveness of the Group’s system of internal control. The committee 
is satisfied with the progress made during the year, save for three areas where further improvement is anticipated during FY18. 
Firstly, there are elements of the forecasting process within Express Gifts that are not fully aligned to operational processes. This 
is particularly the case for the timing of stock intake, which can vary from forecast levels by a greater margin than is desirable. 
Secondly, the bad debt provisioning model within Express Gifts was becoming insufficiently robust, with manual overlays being 
required. The new granular model that has now been introduced is expected to overcome those issues in FY18. Finally, the process 
of change and project management, including embedding contracts, is often suboptimal across the divisions. Changes within the 
Group and Express Gifts finance functions implemented in April 2017 are expected to deliver improvements in all aspects in the 
coming year. Audit Committee Report

External auditors
The committee reviewed the independence of the external auditor and the safeguards that they have in place, including partner and 
staff rotation and extent of non-audit services, to avoid such independence and objectivity being compromised.
The Company’s policy is that the Company should tender the audit at least once every ten years and would not expect to retain the 
same audit firm for a period of longer than twenty years. With KPMG having been first appointed in 2011, a compulsory tender in 
auditors is not required before 2021.
The Group policy on the provision by the external auditor of audit and non-audit services is based on the principle that the external 
auditor should only undertake non-audit services where they are the best provider and the service is permitted under recently revised 
regulations. Following the introduction of those regulations, KPMG were replaced by PwC as tax advisers following an external tender 
process led by the Finance Director. The policy is reviewed annually by the Audit Committee and approved by the Board.
The detailed disclosure of the fees payable to KPMG LLP for both audit and non-audit services performed during the year is set 
out in note 10 to the consolidated financial statements and reflects the committee’s recommendation that greater explanation be 
provided than is required by law. Non-audit work awarded to the auditors related to corporate VAT and taxation advice, and fees 
payable in respect of the sale of Kitbag in 2016.
Much of this VAT work related to the periodic review of specialist aspects of VAT compliance for retail groups for which KPMG have 
developed expertise within the niche home shopping sector.
The committee also considered the level of non-audit fees paid to KPMG LLP in the context of similar fees paid during the year to 
other major accounting firms by the group. It was noted that the total level of such fees were significantly lower in FY17 compared 
to FY16 due to one-off projects that had occurred during FY16. Consequently, whilst the total level of fees paid to KPMG LLP had 
also reduced, their proportion had increased to around 50% of all such fees.  The committee was satisfied with the level of fees, 
independence, objectivity and effectiveness of KPMG LLP and noted the changes proposed for FY18 in respect of changes to tax 
advice.
The committee reviewed the effectiveness of the external audit of the FY16 financial statements by discussing the audit separately 
with the executive directors and senior finance officers, the company secretary and the external auditors. Accordingly, in the light of 
the above, the Board accepted the committee’s recommendation that a resolution for the appointment of KPMG LLP as auditors of 
the Company will be proposed at the forthcoming annual general meeting. A review of the effectiveness of the FY17 audit will be 
carried out following the issue of this annual report.
Internal audit
The role of internal audit combines an in-house internal audit department together with an appropriate level of co-sourcing of 
specialised internal audit services in the areas of financial services and IT. Since the year-end a new head of internal audit was 
appointed following a search led by the Audit Committee Chairman and assisted by external search consultants. The shortlisted 
candidates were interviewed by the Audit Committee Chairman, the Finance Director and the previous head of internal audit. The 
head of internal audit holds discussions with the chairman of the committee at least four times each year and has direct access to 
him at any time.
The team has delivered improvements in four areas:
• Capacity – the size of the team increased during the year, leading to the delivery of a significant uplift in reviews completed in 
the second half of the year;
• Capability – the team’s technical and geographical base has been strengthened to match the business in terms of retail, financial 
services and core finance skills;
• Focus – clearer, shorter reporting has been introduced together with regular communication with key customers aligned against 
a visible, rolling assurance plan; and
• Risk – conversations with review sponsors have focused on controls, risk management and the appropriate toleration of 
exposure.
The committee approved the internal audit programme for the FY18 financial year, including the use of independent third parties.

Findel plc 
Annual report and accounts 2017
On behalf of the Committee, I am pleased to present the first Findel Risk Committee Report, which provides an overview of how 
we, as a Committee, have discharged our responsibilities, setting out both the areas of review and challenge, the development of 
our role and processes and the risk management framework in the business.
This report focuses mainly on:
• Development of the Committee’s governance structures
• Key risks facing the business; 
• Future developments of the Group’s risk management framework
Development of governance
As trialled in last year’s annual report, the Board has established a separate Risk Committee whose primary role is to monitor the 
assessment of strategic risks and check to ensure these are managed within risk appetite in the delivery of strategy. Its written 
terms of reference are available on the Company’s website (www.findel.co.uk).
The Committee is comprised of three independent non-executive directors.  Brief biographical details of the Committee members, 
are set out on page 27 and the number of meetings and attendance are set out on page 33. The executive directors, the Chairman 
of the Board, the Company Secretary and the Head of Internal Audit attended each meeting by invitation together with other senior 
managers as appropriate.
Before engaging in formal Committee meetings the members took part in a series of engagements with management as part of 
their induction. This included but was not limited to:
• an internal overview of both the existing top down and bottom up approaches to risk management; and
• discussions with management and a series of internal workshops regarding our risk management framework.
Management reached the conclusion, fully supported by the Chairman of the Committee, that it would be helpful to have an 
external view of the Company’s risk management framework and resourcing and to identify areas for improvement. Management 
commissioned Deloitte to carry out such a review which has been completed since the year end and management is developing 
prioritised improvement plans whilst keeping the Committee informed of progress in that regard.
The Committee in its full capacity met once in FY17, following the informal engagements with management referred to above and 
has met again since the end of the year, with an anticipated schedule of four meetings per year from this point forward.
In terms of the broader structure of risk management within the business, a combination of structured governance including 
oversight committees, capture and reporting tools, alongside a programme of education and training are utilised.

Key risks facing the business
As part of the above activity, the business took the opportunity to re-frame its core risks. These are detailed below at a high level.
• An uncertain economic outlook in relation to consumer indebtedness, disposable income, inflation and the outcome of Brexit on 
the wider economy and Findel’s customer base.
• A lack of a modern I.T. capability, impacting the ability to operate flexibly and at speed, in a competitive digital environment.
• A dependency on the deployment of a data strategy in an increasingly regulatory environment, to deliver personalised and 
targeted customer engagement.
• Increasing cost pressures from a weakening pound and the ability to pass cost increases onto customers, impacting margin rate.
• A dependency and tightening level of Government funding for schools is impacting demand.
• Building a digital capability to match the increasing transition of customers from traditional media and catalogue to on-line.
• Attracting and retaining the right talent given in particular challenges relating to location.
• The increasing demands of the regulatory environment in which EGL operates and the level of focus and resource required in 
a business with competing priorities.
• Our proposition, including policies and operational procedures, fails to meet the needs of different customer groups impacting 
the customer experience, demand and potentially recovery of bad debt.
These have been communicated to all of our people so that:
• each member of staff can recognise how they impact on those risks and those risks impact on them;
• financial and operational authorisation levels alongside risk appetite statements can continue to be enhanced in line with the 
core risks; and
• escalation and de-escalation is clearly communicated as necessary to decision makers.
This work enabled the Committee to report to the Board on the key business risks facing the Company. The full Board then used 
this reporting as a basis to carry out a robust assessment of the principal risks facing the Company, including those that would 
threaten its business model, future performance, solvency or liquidity. The principal risks and uncertainties that could impact the 
performance of the Group are set out on pages 22 to 24.
Future developments of the risk management capability
As with all operational functions, the business is keeping its risk management framework under constant review to ensure it is not 
only operating effectively but is as reliable as possible. To that end, over the next 12 months the Committee will:
• monitor the steps being taken by the business to start implementing the enhancements identified within the Deloitte review;
• conduct a number of deep dives into core business risks; and
• draw together multiple sources of assurance including 1st, 2nd and 3rd line activity to provide an overall understanding of the 
progress being made.

Corporate Social Responsibility Report
The Board continues to understand the importance that its Corporate Social Responsibility has in the ongoing success of the Findel 
Group. We remain committed to improvement in all of our interactions with employees, customers, suppliers, the environment and 
the wider community.
Our People
Our People are fundamental to the success of our Group.
The Group seeks to set objectives, monitor performance and determine the development needs of its staff, aiming to ensure 
consistency and to enable our people to understand their contribution to the Group objectives. Both businesses have employee 
engagement programmes which encourages people’s involvement in the business.
We try where possible to offer flexible working solutions which help to maintain a balance between work and life outside of the 
workplace. With the exception of approximately 150 staff in Asia, the Group is a UK-based employer. Many of our sites are in 
multi-cultural areas of the UK and we operate a fair, equal opportunities employment culture which embraces multi-culturalism, 
equality and diversity. The needs of specific groups are identified and addressed with, for example, prayer facilities and employee 
information in foreign languages where appropriate.
We have a strong commitment to the Modern Slavery Act through our MSA statements, we comply with the National Minimum 
and Living Wage recommendations to ensure that our people are paid fairly for the work and duties they diligently carry out and 
we are a fair and consistent employer as evidenced through our employee feedback. This year, we conducted a Group wide 
review of zero hour contracts. The findings were compliant with the central government policy but also more generous in terms 
of additional benefits such as payment for breaks.  As a result of the review, management agreed that temporary warehouse staff 
who had worked more than 12 months would move to a permanent contract to give them even more job security resulting with 
approximately 20 temporary employees moving to a permanent contract in March of this year.
Gender diversity is also important 32% of the senior management team are female (which is an increase of 6% from last year), 
whilst this figure increases to 52% across the entire workforce. The table below details these figures at year end:
 Male % Female %
Senior Management 53 68 26 32
All Employees 761 48 835 52
Learning and development is also an important part of our People strategy and Express Gifts and Findel Education offer NVQ’s and 
role-specific training programmes. Both businesses have a dedicated training function that supports the development needs and 
succession planning of the business, together with measuring the employee and customer experience.
Findel Education also recognises the importance of giving customers the protection of knowing our people are suitable to work 
within the education sector and as such the entire sales force and relevant members of the Marketing and Trading teams are DBS 
checked. Express Gifts carry out the same checks for all Collections staff giving confidence to customers.
Several staff benefit schemes exist which offer retail discounts and vouchers, technology discount schemes, reduced cost gym 
membership, NHS checks for the over 40’s and a cycle to work scheme, promoting health and wellbeing.
Health and Safety
The Group has a comprehensive system to assess, monitor and mitigate health and safety risk within the business which is 
subject to continuous improvement and review. The health and safety policies and procedures are available to all employees via the 
divisional intranets.
The focus on health and safety continues and we work closely with our employers’ liability insurers, Aviva, in reviewing and 
improving risk levels across the businesses. There was a small increase in the total accident numbers in the year to March 2017 
although this was from a very low base given the size and nature of our businesses and the number of serious accidents fell by 
45% year on year.
All areas of the business operate a twelve-month rolling risk assessment programme run by qualified Health and Safety 
professionals. This approach allows for greater focus on individual areas of health and safety. Each site receives several inspections 
during the year.
Findel Education have successfully renewed its certifications in ISO9001, 14001 and OHSAS18001, the internationally recognised 
standard for Occupational Health and Safety Management Systems. They are also a registered training centre for the Chartered 
Institute of Environmental Health. Findel remains a member of the British Safety Council and last year became a member of the 
Royal Society for the prevention of Accidents (RoSPA).
A pilot scheme of near miss accident reporting was introduced during the year and this will further enhance our systems to identify 
any emerging risks that can be rectified prior to harm being caused. Additionally, a new Group Health and Safety Handbook was 
produced and circulated to all employees last year, as part of our system of periodic reviews. Corporate Social Responsibility Report

Our Products and Customers
The Group sells a range of over 100,000 stock lines across an extensive range of categories. Our suppliers are similarly diverse 
from individual factories to large multinational companies. Product safety and quality has to be at the forefront when selecting any 
product for our range. Appropriate safety certification is obtained (backed by independent third party testing where necessary) and 
each division has a team dedicated to maintaining these standards.
Express Gifts require new suppliers to produce an Ethical Trading statement as part of the set-up process from a recognised third 
party auditor. They have also set up, with the help of Veriso, a grading scheme for suppliers which allows continuous improvement 
of conditions and standards within the Express Gifts supply chain.
Findel Asia Sourcing Ltd, now with 2 offices in Hong Kong and Shanghai, has been sourcing products for group companies and 
third parties for over 30 years and requires that each of the 270 factories they deal with has a valid, reputable audit certificate in 
place with at least six months’ validity and there is a programme for monitoring the renewal of these. A further level of scrutiny 
was introduced last year to require evidence that factories with improvement works required under the audits provide photographic 
evidence of compliance. Findel Education have included adherence to the UK Modern Slavery Act within the new version of their 
Trading Manual for 2017 and are holding a supplier workshop later this year in which Ethical Sourcing & the Modern Slavery Act will 
feature alongside a section on product compliance.
Within Express Gifts, various products in our household and children’s furniture ranges are procured from FSC and sustainable 
sources, whilst within Findel Education all applicable products are assessed for quality & safety including, Toy Safety Directive, Low 
Voltage Directive, EMC REACH, ROHS, FSC and EU timber regulations compliance. Findel Education are driving standards forward 
within the education sector with the release of version 2 of their Product Compliance Manual in 2017, supporting vendors in product 
quality, safety & mandatory compliance by category.
Express Gifts has seen the importance it places on safety and quality of products translated into a reduction in its returns rate by 
0.4%. This is in spite of further diversification into clothing ranges which by their nature have a higher rate of return.
Findel Education’s Customer Voice programme has once again shown strong positive trends in customer feedback. Their net 
promoter score continues to show exceptional results, and in March 2017, they recorded a score of 90% against a base established 
in 2010 of 50%. There has been an 18% reduction in credits, returns and replacements over the last three years, and customer 
queries have reduced by 48% over the last five years, this clearly demonstrates that Findel Education are fulfilling their mission 
of being ‘easy to do business with’ through an ongoing commitment to continuous improvement.
As part of its strategy to “put the customer at the heart of everything we do”, Express Gifts has deployed several initiatives to help 
reduce Returns rates and this can be seen by improvements in a number of customer metrics.
The Environment
As a business mainly operating within mail order and e-commerce, the Group environmental impact is predominantly through utility 
consumption and our use and disposal of paper and packaging, although as a non-manufacturing company, our emissions remain 
relatively low.
The Group’s Scope 1 emissions from its vehicle fleet in 2016/17 were 170 tonnes of CO
2
 compared to 244 tonnes in 2015/16, 
a reduction of 30% due to a combination of a significantly reduced fleet size and a switch to lower emission vehicles on renewal 
of the remaining fleet. The Scope 2 emissions from its energy usage were 5,405 tonnes of CO
2
 which is an increase of 1.81% from 
5,310 tonnes in 2015/16 – this is significantly less than the percentage year on year increase in the Group’s business volumes.
The high number of relatively low value individual despatches in our businesses continues to make it economically and 
environmentally efficient to use third party carriers to transport products to our customers. Prior to appointment and on a regular 
basis thereafter, we ask our third-party carriers to demonstrate their environmental credentials.
Each of our businesses continues to supply its customers with the information necessary to make informed environmental choices. 
This includes the identification in our catalogues of products made from renewable or recycled materials and the energy ratings of 
our white goods. Our Education division continues to increase its range of eco-friendly products which includes products made 
from recycled paper, Fairtrade, energy efficiency A rated appliances, environmentally friendly products and lower carbon footprint 
UK-sourced products.
All sites within Findel Education have ISO14001 accreditation, an internationally recognised standard for environmental management 
which ensures each location has a fully compliant Environmental Management System. Corporate Social Responsibility Report I Governance

Annual report and accounts 2017
Energy
The Group’s major use of energy continues to be the heating and lighting of buildings, powered conveyor equipment and in our 
vehicle fleet. The more efficient use of space combined with energy management initiatives have seen a reduction of total energy 
consumption in our buildings as reported above.
Energy efficiency is a material consideration when procuring vehicles, equipment or services. From energy saving lighting 
installation to further automation in our major Express Gifts warehouse. Our major sites all benefit from centralised control of 
heating and ventilation systems and are subject to regular monitoring to ensure they are operating as efficiently as possible. The 
Nottingham Logistics Centre recently installed a self-learning energy management system with an anticipated decrease in gas usage 
of 20%.
The Group Company Car Policy focuses on low carbon emission vehicles with a reduction in the CO
2
 limit for all new vehicles from 
a maximum permitted CO
2
 of 160 g/km to 130 g/km. This has seen a reduction in our average fleet emissions from 115 g/km in 
2015/16 to 104g/km in 2016/17.
Paper
The tonnage of paper used in our catalogues and brochures has shown a reduction from 12,956 tonnes in 2015/16 to 12,827 tonnes 
in 2016/17, a reduction of 1%. All paper used for printing by our divisions is now manufactured at mills which have Programme for 
the Endorsement of Forest Certification (PEFC) chain of custody certification.
Packaging
The Group is constantly seeking innovative ways to minimise the level of packaging used, whilst ensuring that products are received 
by our customers undamaged. We also actively seek out opportunities with suppliers to reduce packaging.
In the current year, we have once again seen a rise in the overall packaging levels consistent with the increased turnover and reflect 
the already low levels of packaging achieved by previous initiatives.
Waste
All EGL sites continue to be Zero to Landfill sites and have been since May 2012. In the last 12 months, 2,629 tonnes of waste was 
collected, of which 69% was recycled and 31% was recovered via an Energy from Waste (EFW) plant. This is an increase in line 
with turnover against last year’s figure.
Findel Education have achieved a Zero to Landfill standard at its two largest sites in Nottingham and Enfield, which recently merged 
to create further economies of scale, and have continued to reduce the landfill element of its total waste to 2.14% from 2.67% last 
year.
Community Support
Once again, the Company and its employees continue to support a number of local and national charities, together with local 
communities and organisations close to our various bases of operation.
Both Express Gifts and Findel Education are partnering local schools providing support and guidance to staff and students. Findel 
Education are also involved with the Greggs Breakfast Club at Moston Lane Primary School in Manchester which helps the children 
get a great start to their day and promotes health, well-being and development. Statement of directors’ responsibilities in respect of the Annual Report and  
the financial statements
Governance I Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities
66
Findel plc 
Annual report and accounts 2017
The directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report and the Group and parent Company financial statements in 
accordance with applicable law and regulations.
Company law requires the directors to prepare Group and parent Company financial statements for each financial year. Under that 
law they are required to prepare the Group financial statements in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU and applicable law 
and have elected to prepare the parent Company financial statements in accordance with UK Accounting Standards, including FRS 
101 Reduced Disclosure Framework.
Under company law the directors must not approve the financial statements unless they are satisfied that they give a true and fair 
view of the state of affairs of the Group and parent Company and of their profit or loss for that period. In preparing each of the 
Group and parent Company financial statements, the directors are required to:
• select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;
• make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and prudent;
• for the Group financial statements, state whether they have been prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU;
• for the parent Company financial statements, state whether applicable UK Accounting Standards have been followed, subject to 
any material departures disclosed and explained in the parent Company financial statements; and
• prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Group and the parent 
Company will continue in business.
The directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain the parent Company’s 
transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the parent Company and enable them to 
ensure that its financial statements comply with the Companies Act 2006. They are responsible for such internal control as they 
determine is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to 
fraud or error, and have general responsibility for taking such steps as are reasonably open to them to safeguard the assets of the 
Group and to prevent and detect fraud and other irregularities.
Under applicable law and regulations, the directors are also responsible for preparing a Strategic Report, Directors’ Report, Directors’ 
Remuneration Report and Corporate Governance Statement that complies with that law and those regulations.
The directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the corporate and financial information included on the Company’s 
website. Legislation in the UK governing the preparation and dissemination of financial statements may differ from legislation in 
other jurisdictions.
Responsibility statement of the directors in respect of the Annual Report
We confirm that to the best of our knowledge:
i) the financial statements, prepared in accordance with the applicable set of accounting standards, give a true and fair view of the 
assets, liabilities, financial position and profit or loss of the Company and the undertakings included in the consolidation taken as 
a whole; and
ii) the Strategic Report includes a fair review of the development and performance of the business and the position of the issuer 
and the undertakings included in the consolidation taken as a whole, together with a description of the principal risks and 
uncertainties that they face.
We consider the annual report and accounts, taken as a whole, is fair, balanced and understandable and provides the information 
necessary for shareholders to assess the Group’s position and performance, business model and strategy.
The directors of Findel plc are detailed on page 27.

2. Our assessment of risks of material misstatement
In arriving at our audit opinion above on the financial statements, the risks of material misstatement that had the greatest effect on 
our audit, in decreasing order of audit significance, were as follows (unchanged from 2016):
The risk Our response
Recoverability of trade 
receivables in Express Gifts 
Limited 
(£270.1m, allowance for doubtful 
debts £83.4m; 2016: £244.3m, 
allowance for doubtful debts 
£43.1m)
Refer to page 58 (Audit Committee 
Report), page 84 (accounting policy) 
and pages 106 to 108 (financial 
disclosures).
Calculation complexity
The Group has a significant level of trade 
receivables which are due to be recovered 
by instalments as a result of extended 
credit terms offered to customers by 
the Express Gifts Limited business. 
The balance of receivables comprises a 
significant number of individually small 
balances.
The Group therefore uses a complex 
financial model to determine the 
appropriate level of provision against 
balances which may not ultimately be 
recovered. 
Accounting treatment
A new financial model has been prepared 
during the year and as a result the 
calculation basis of the impairment 
provision has changed compared to that 
used in prior periods, although a number 
of the input assumptions and estimates 
remain similar, including the identification 
of trigger events for customer default 
(“emergence period”), forbearance and 
debt sale strategies. Changes in estimates 
and methodology in the year as a result 
of the adoption of the new model have 
given rise to an increase in the provision 
of £35.2m which must be appropriately 
disclosed.
Subjective valuation
The calculation of the Group’s impairment 
provision requires the Directors to make 
significant judgements and assumptions 
over the recoverability of receivables 
balances. 
The receivables provision is most sensitive 
to assumptions made in respect of the 
probability of default, the timing and value 
of cash recoveries in particular in respect 
of debt sales and the emergence period. 
This is due to limitations with the historical 
data used to support the assumptions 
made and the risk of forecasting error. 
The provisioning model also needs 
to adequately factor in forbearance 
arrangements.
Small changes in the assumptions and 
estimates used in the provisioning model 
can have a significant effect on the results 
of the Group. As a consequence, adequate 
disclosure of the assumptions and the 
areas of estimation uncertainty is also 
important.
Our procedures included: 
—  Control re-performance: Testing key 
controls over the capture, monitoring and 
reporting of credit advances to customers, 
by re-performing the controls.
—  Assessing methodology choice: Comparing 
the methodology used to our interpretation of 
the requirements of the relevant accounting 
standards. 
—  Historical comparisons: Critically assessing 
the Group’s assumptions regarding the 
timing and value of cash recoveries based 
on historical experience, and the Group’s 
approved debt sale strategies. 
—  Benchmarking assumptions: Benchmarking 
the Group’s key assumptions, such as 
emergence period, and assessed provision 
coverage to externally available data, with 
particular focus on similar lending.
—  Assessing transparency: Considering the 
adequacy of the Group’s disclosures of the 
assumptions and the areas of estimation

of the new model should be recorded as a 
prior period adjustment in accordance with 
IAS 8.

Financial services redress 
provisions
(£25.5m; 2016: £15.3m)
Refer to page 58 (Audit Committee 
Report), page 88 (accounting policy) 
and page 111 (financial disclosures).
Subjective estimate
The Group’s provision of credit services to 
customers means that it operates within a 
regulated environment which requires the 
Group to comply with the principles of the 
Financial Conduct Authority (FCA). There 
is a risk that any non-compliance with 
these principles could trigger the need for 
significant customer redress programmes. 
Conduct issues have previously been 
identified in relation to the sale of financial 
services products, which have resulted in 
the requirement for significant provisions 
for redress and refunds. As a result, and 
given the total value of the provision 
recorded, and the increases in provisions 
required in the current and prior year, this 
area was identified as one of the risks of 
material misstatement. 
Where a need for customer redress 
has been identified, a significant level 
of judgement is required in assessing 
the level of the Group’s expected 
cash outflow, and hence the provision 
required. These judgements are based on 
consultations with the FCA but also involve 
directors’ assessment, using a complex 
provisioning model which incorporates 
assumptions over the timing and value of 
redress payments.
Our procedures included:
—  Correspondence review: Reviewing 
correspondence with the FCA and the Group’s 
external advisors, and reviewing customer 
complaints for material issues, in order to 
assess the appropriateness of provisions made 
for all known material redress issues.
—  Assessing methodology: Assessing the 
provision methodology against regulator 
guidelines and our market experience to 
ensure the provision calculations are not out 
of line with regulatory requirements or market 
practice.
—  Re-performance: Re-performing provision 
model calculations to evaluate the accuracy 
and completeness of the model, assessing 
the methodology against the latest regulatory 
directives.
—  Historical experience: Comparing the 
customer response rates, claims uphold rates 
and redress settlement levels used within the 
provision model to actual experience.
—  Sensitivity analysis: Performing and 
assessing the impact of sensitivity analysis in 
relation to the key assumptions on the level of 
provision recorded.
—  Assessing transparency: Considering the 
adequacy of the Group’s disclosures in respect 
of the sensitivity of the provisions to the 
assumptions made.
Classification of items as 
individually significant
(£75.7m; 2016: £26.5m)
Refer to page 58 (Audit Committee 
Report), page 81 (accounting policy) 
and pages 94 and 95 (financial 
disclosures).
Presentation appropriateness
Judgements are required in arriving at 
the categorisation of items as individually 
significant in the consolidated income 
statement, in particular as to whether the 
nature of the costs is unusual by its nature 
or scale and is of such significance that 
separate disclosure is required in order to 
fairly present the financial performance of 
the Group.
Inappropriate classification of items as 
individually significant could result in a 
misleading presentation of the trading 
performance of the Group for the year, 
or over a period of time.
Our procedures included:
—  Tests of detail: Agreeing items to supporting 
documentation to understand the nature of 
the items and evaluate the appropriateness of 
their classification as individually significant, 
having regard to the Group’s accounting 
policy. This also included assessing whether 
there are any transactions included within the 
results before individually significant items 
which we consider should be classified as 
individually significant.
—  Assessing consistency: Where provisions 
were made in the prior period for individually 
significant items, assessing whether any 
releases of the provision have also been 
appropriately classified as an individually 
significant item. 
—  Assessing transparency: Considering the 
adequacy of the disclosure in relation to 
individually significant items being described 
clearly, accurately and consistently and 
assessing the extent to which prominence is 
given to information on results both before 
and after individually significant items. 70

Valuation of inventories
(£57.1m; 2016: £53.5m)
Refer to page 58 (Audit Committee 
Report), page 85 (accounting policy) 
and page 105 (financial disclosures).
Subjective valuation
The Group has significant levels of 
inventory, and judgements are made with 
regard to the categorisation of stock as 
obsolete and/or slow moving, and therefore 
whether items should be considered for 
provision. 
Estimation is then involved in arriving at a 
provision against cost in respect of slow 
moving and obsolete inventories so that 
inventory is carried at the lower of cost and 
net realisable value.
Our procedures included: 
—  Tests of detail: Comparing inventory levels 
to historical sales data to corroborate whether 
slow moving and obsolete inventories have 
been appropriately identified, and challenging 
the Group’s categorisation as obsolete or slow 
moving.  
—  Historical comparisons: Considering 
realisations of inventories during the period 
and after the period end, in particular of 
clearance categories, and comparing these to 
the Group’s expected recoveries for inventory 
categorised as obsolete and/or slow moving.  
—  Assessing transparency: Assessing the 
adequacy of the Group’s disclosures in respect 
of the judgement and estimation made in 
respect of inventory provisioning
Recoverability of goodwill and 
other intangible assets 
(£nil, £26.2m; 2016: £16.7m, £30.6m)
Refer to page 58 (Audit Committee 
Report), page 83 (accounting policy) 
and pages 102 to 104 (financial 
disclosures).
Forecast-based valuation
The current trading environment has 
remained increasingly challenging 
for Findel Education, where revenue 
has decreased during the period and 
profitability has not improved [resulting in 
an impairment charge in the current year]. 
Due to the inherent uncertainty involved 
in forecasting and discounting future 
cash flows, which are the basis of the 
assessment of recoverability, this is one of 
the key judgemental areas that our audit is 
concentrated on.
Our procedures included: 
—  Historical comparison: Assessing the 
Group’s forecasting accuracy by comparing 
actual results in the period to what was 
forecast in the prior year.
—  Benchmarking assumptions: Critically 
evaluating the risk adjusted discount rates, 
having regard for market observable data with 
regard to risk free rates, returns on equity 
for comparator companies and company size 
premium. We also evaluated the assumptions 
for cost inflation and terminal growth rate, 
having regard for market data.
—  Our valuation expertise: With assistance 
from our own valuation specialists, we 
determined an appropriate range of discount 
rates adjusted for forecasting risk and 
compared to the discount rate used by the 
Group. 
—  Comparing valuations: Comparing the 
sum of the discounted cash flows to the 
Group’s market capitalisation to assess 
the reasonableness of the value in use 
calculations.  
—  Assessing transparency: Assessing whether 
the Group’s disclosures about the sensitivity 
of the outcome of the impairment assessment 
to changes in key assumptions reflected the 
risks inherent in the valuation of goodwill and 
unamortised intangibles. 71

3. Our application of materiality and an 
overview of the scope of our audit
Materiality for the Group financial statements as a 
whole was set at £2.0m, determined with reference 
to a benchmark of Group revenue of £455.5m, 
of which it represents 0.4% (2016: 0.4%) when 
considering revenue from continuing operations 
(2016: continuing and discontinued operations). 
We have used total revenue as the benchmark 
for setting our materiality as total revenues is a 
relevant performance measure and is more stable 
than profit before tax from continuing operations. 
We reported to the Audit Committee any corrected 
or uncorrected identified misstatements exceeding 
£0.1m, in addition to other identified misstatements 
that warranted reporting on qualitative grounds. 
All of the Group’s four (2016: five) reporting 
components were subjected to full scope audits for 
group purposes and covered 100% (2016: 100%) of 
Group revenue; 100% (2016: 100%) of Group profit 
before taxation; and 100% (2016: 99%) of total 
Group assets. 
The Group team instructed component auditors as 
to the significant areas to be covered, including the 
relevant risks detailed above and the information 
to be reported back. The Group team approved the 
component materialities, which ranged from £1.5m 
to £0.3m, having regard to the mix of size and risk 
profile of the Group across the components. The 
work on one of the four components (2016: one of 
the five components) was performed by component 
auditors and the rest by the Group team.
Telephone conference meetings were held 
with component auditors. At these meetings, 
the findings reported to the Group team were 
discussed in more detail, and any further work 
required by the Group team was then performed 
by the component auditor.

4. Our opinion on other matters prescribed by the 
Companies Act 2006 is unmodified
In our opinion:
—  the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be 
audited has been properly prepared in accordance with the 
Companies Act 2006; and
—  the information given in the Strategic Report and the 
Directors’ Report for the financial year is consistent with 
the financial statements.
Based solely on the work required to be undertaken in the 
course of the audit of the financial statements and from 
reading the Strategic report and the Directors’ report:
—  we have not identified material misstatements in those 
reports; and  
—  in our opinion, those reports have been prepared in 
accordance with the Companies Act 2006.
5. We have nothing to report on the disclosures of 
principal risks
Based on the knowledge we acquired during our audit, we 
have nothing material to add or draw attention to in relation to:
—  the directors’ viability statement on page 28, concerning 
the principal risks, their management, and, based on that,

—  the disclosures in note 1 of the financial statements 
concerning the use of the going concern basis of 
accounting.
6. We have nothing to report in respect of the matters on 
which we are required to report by exception
Under ISAs (UK and Ireland) we are required to report to you 
if, based on the knowledge we acquired during our audit, we 
have identified other information in the annual report that 
contains a material inconsistency with either that knowledge 
or the financial statements, a material misstatement of fact, 
or that is otherwise misleading.
In particular, we are required to report to you if:
—  we have identified material inconsistencies between the 
knowledge we acquired during our audit and the directors’ 
statement that they consider that the annual report and 
financial statements taken as a whole is fair, balanced and 
understandable and provides the information necessary 
for shareholders to assess the Group’s position and 
performance, business model and strategy; or
—  the Audit Committee Report does not appropriately address 
matters communicated by us to the Audit Committee. 
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to 
you if, in our opinion:

parent company, or returns adequate for our audit have not 
been received from branches not visited by us; or
—  the parent company financial statements and the part of 
the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited are not in 
agreement with the accounting records and returns; or
—  certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration specified by 
law are not made; or
—  we have not received all the information and explanations 
we require for our audit.
Under the Listing Rules we are required to review:  
—  the directors’ statements, set out on page 28, in relation

responsibilities.
Scope and responsibilities
As explained more fully in the Directors’ Responsibilities 
Statement set out on page 66, the directors are responsible 
for the preparation of the financial statements and 
for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view.

Findel plc 
Annual report and accounts 2017
1 General information and accounting policies
Findel plc is a company incorporated in the United Kingdom under the Companies Act 2006. The address of the registered office is 
given on page 27. The nature of the Group’s operations and its principal activities are set out in the Strategic Report on pages 1 to 25.
These financial statements are presented in sterling because that is the currency of the primary economic environment in which the 
Group operates. Foreign operations are included in accordance with the accounting policies set out below.
Impact of accounting standards not yet effective
No standards have been adopted for the first time that affect the reported results or financial position.
At the date of authorisation of these financial statements, the following Standards and Interpretations which have not been applied 
in these financial statements were in issue but not yet effective (and in some cases had not yet been adopted by the EU). Their 
adoption is not expected to have a material effect on the financial statements unless otherwise indicated. The Group does not 
intend to early adopt these standards:
• IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers will be effective from the year ending March 2019 onwards. Management 
continues to assess the likely impact of this standard.
• IFRS 9 Financial Instruments recognition and measurement will be effective from the year ending March 2019 onwards, with the 
main impact being on the provisioning methodology used to value the receivables book in Express Gifts. Whilst management is 
still considering the impact of this new standard, it is anticipated that the level of provisioning required will be higher than that 
required under the current standard (IAS 39) due to the requirement to make provisions on a prospective loss basis rather than 
on an incurred loss basis as required by the existing standard. Process and modelling amendments will be implemented in line 
with the effective date.
• IFRS 16 Leases will be effective from the year ending March 2020 onwards and the impact on the financial statements will be 
significant to Findel plc. IFRS 16 requires lessees to recognise a lease liability reflecting future lease payments and a right-of-use 
asset for all lease contracts. Therefore, the substantial majority of the Group’s operating lease commitments (some £56m on an 
undiscounted basis, as shown in note 26) would be brought on balance sheet and amortised and depreciated separately. There 
will be no impact on cash flows although the presentation of the cash flow statement will change significantly. Management is 
still considering the impact of this new standard and is as yet unable to quantify its likely impact.
Basis of accounting
The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) adopted for use 
in the European Union and therefore comply with Article 4 of the EU IAS Regulation. The financial statements have been prepared 
on the going concern basis as set out below. The financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis except for 
the revaluation of certain financial instruments.
The principal accounting policies adopted are set out below and have been applied consistently in the current and prior period.
Going concern
In determining whether the Group’s financial statements for the period ended 31 March 2017 can be prepared on a going concern 
basis, the directors considered all factors likely to affect its future development, performance and its financial position, including its 
cash flows, liquidity position and borrowing facilities and the risks and uncertainties relating to its business activities in the current 
economic climate. The financial position of the Group, its cash flows, liquidity position and borrowing facilities and details of those 
key risks and uncertainties are set out in further detail in the Finance Director’s Review on pages 18 to 20.
The directors have reviewed the Group’s trading and cash flow forecasts as part of their going concern assessment, including 
considering the potential impact of reasonably possible downside sensitivities which take into account the uncertainties in the 
current operating environment, including, amongst other matters, demand for the Group’s products, its available financing facilities, 
and regulatory licensing and compliance. Although at certain times the level of facility and/or covenant headroom reduces to a 
level which requires cash flow initiatives to be introduced to ensure that the funding requirements do not exceed the committed 
facilities or result in non-compliance with covenants, management are confident that such actions are supportable, and that further 
controllable mitigating actions are available that could be implemented if required. The Group’s current banking facilities mature in 
November 2019.
Taking into account the above circumstances, the directors have formed a judgement that there is a reasonable expectation, and 
there are no material uncertainties, that the Group and the Company have adequate resources to continue in operational existence 
for a period of at least 12 months.
Accordingly, they continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the Group’s annual consolidated financial statements. 81

Basis of consolidation
Subsidiaries
Subsidiaries are consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the Group. They cease to be consolidated from the 
date that the Group no longer has control.
Inter-company transactions, balances and unrealised gains on transactions between group companies are eliminated on 
consolidation. Unrealised losses are also eliminated unless the transaction provides evidence of an impairment of the asset 
transferred.
The financial statements of all subsidiaries are prepared to the same reporting date as the parent company.
Segmental reporting
IFRS 8 requires operating segments to be identified on the basis of the internal financial information reported to the Chief 
Operating Decision Maker (CODM) who is primarily responsible for the allocation of resources to segments and the assessment 
of performance of the segments. The CODM is the Board of the Company.
The CODM assesses profit performance using operating profit measured on a basis consistent with the disclosure in the Group 
financial information.
Prior to the disposal of Kitbag Limited on 1 February 2016, the Group was organised into four operating segments:
• Express Gifts;
• Findel Education;
• Overseas sourcing; and
• Kitbag.
Following the disposal of Kitbag Limited on 1 February 2016, the Group is now organised into three operating segments.
Income statement presentation
Individually significant items
As permitted by IAS1 ‘Presentation of financial statements’, an item is disclosed separately if it is considered unusual by its nature 
or scale, and is of such significance that separate disclosure is required in the financial statements in order to fairly present the 
financial performance of the Group. Such items are referred to as individually significant items and are described in note 6.
Discontinued operations
The Group completed the disposal of its sports retail company, Kitbag Limited, on 1 February 2016. The business met the criteria to 
be accounted for as a discontinued operation as defined in IFRS 5, “Non-current assets held for sale and discontinued operations” 
in the prior period. Results from this discontinued operation have therefore been separated out in the comparator consolidated 
income statement to enhance the comparability of the ongoing businesses. Further details are given in note 7.
Revenue recognition
Revenue comprises the fair value of the sale of goods and services to external customers, net of value added tax, rebates, 
discounts and returns. Revenue is recognised as follows:
Sale of goods
Revenue is recognised when the significant risks and rewards of ownership of the goods have passed to the buyer, which is 
considered to be upon despatch, and the amount of revenue can be measured reliably.
A provision for estimated returns is made based upon past experience and trends, representing the profit on goods sold during the 
period which will be returned and refunded after the period end.
Interest income
Interest income on customer credit accounts is recognised on a time-proportion basis, using the effective interest method.
Rendering of services
Revenue is recognised in respect of non-interest related financial income and delivery charges at the point at which the service is 
deemed to have been rendered. In all cases income is recognised when the relevant service has been provided to the customer. Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements

Volume based discounts and other arrangements with suppliers
Both Express Gifts and Findel Education entered into volume based discount agreements with suppliers in both the current and 
prior period. Discounts are calculated annually based upon an agreed percentage of purchases made from suppliers with which 
an agreement is in place. Discounts are agreed with suppliers prior to being recorded in the income statement. In most cases, 
the discount is set off against outstanding invoices.
Both Express Gifts and Findel Education also receive contributions from suppliers in exchange for their products being listed in 
publications. These contributions are agreed with suppliers on a case by case basis.
The value of volume based discounts and contributions received in the period ended 31 March 2017 was approximately £4.4m 
(2016: £5.7m) which represents approximately 1.9% (2016: 2.6%) of cost of sales relating to continuing operations.
Foreign currency translation
Functional and presentational currency
Both the consolidated and Company’s financial statements are presented in sterling, which is the Company’s and Group’s functional 
and presentational currency. Items included in the financial statements of each of the Group’s entities are measured using the 
currency of the primary economic environment in which the entity operates (the functional currency).
Transactions and balances
Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded at the exchange rate prevailing on the date of the transaction. At each balance 
sheet date, monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the exchange rate prevailing at the 
balance sheet date. Translation differences on monetary items are taken to the income statement with the exception of differences 
on translations that are subject to effective cash flow hedges.
Translation differences on non-monetary items are reported as part of the fair value gain or loss and are included in either equity or 
the income statement as appropriate.
Group companies
The results and financial position of overseas Group entities are translated into sterling as follows:
• assets and liabilities are translated at the closing rate at the date of that balance sheet;
• income and expenses are translated at the average exchange rate for the period; and
• all resulting exchange differences are recognised as a separate component of equity.
On consolidation, exchange differences arising from the translation of the net investment in foreign entities are taken to equity. 
Tax charges and credits attributable to those exchange differences are taken directly to equity.
Share-based payments
The Group operates a number of equity-settled, share-based compensation plans.
The Group has applied the requirements of IFRS 2 Share-based payments.
The Group principally issues equity-settled share-based payments to certain employees. Equity-settled share-based payments are 
measured at fair value (excluding the effect of non market-based vesting conditions) at the date of grant. The fair value determined 
at the grant date of the equity-settled share-based payments is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on 
the Group’s estimate of shares that will eventually vest and adjusted for the effect of non market-based vesting conditions.
Fair value is usually measured by use of the Stochastic Valuation (aka “Monte-Carlo”) model. The expected life used in the 
model has been adjusted, based on management’s best estimate, for the effects of non-transferability, exercise restrictions, 
and behavioural considerations.
Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment are held at cost less accumulated depreciation and any impairment in value.
Depreciation is charged on a straight-line basis as follows:
• Freehold properties are depreciated over 50 years;
• Leasehold premises with lease terms of 50 years or less are depreciated over the remaining period of the lease;
• Plant and equipment is depreciated over 3 to 20 years according to the estimated life of the asset;
• Equipment on hire or lease is depreciated over the period of the lease;
• Land is not depreciated.
Assets held in the course of construction are not depreciated until they are brought into use. 83

Software and IT development costs
Expenditure on IT software development is recognised as an internally-generated intangible asset up to the point where the main 
projects cease to involve external contractors, and only if all of the following conditions are met:
• an asset is created that can be identified (such as software and new processes);
• it is probable that the asset created will generate future economic benefits; and
• the development cost of the asset can be measured reliably.
Internally-generated intangible assets are amortised on a straight-line basis over their useful lives of three to seven years. Where 
no internally-generated intangible asset can be recognised, expenditure is recognised as an expense in the period in which it is 
incurred.
Business combinations
The acquisition of subsidiaries is accounted for using the purchase method. The cost of acquisition is measured at the aggregate 
of the fair values, at the date of purchase, of consideration given in exchange for control of the acquiree. The acquiree’s identifiable 
assets and liabilities that meet the conditions for recognition under IFRS 3 Business Combinations are recognised at their fair value 
at the acquisition date.
Acquisition costs are expensed as incurred.
Goodwill
Goodwill is the excess of the fair value of the consideration payable for an acquisition over the fair value of the Group’s share 
of identifiable net assets of a subsidiary, associate or joint venture acquired at the date of acquisition. Fair values are attributed 
to the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities that existed at the date of acquisition, reflecting their condition at that 
date. Adjustments are made where necessary to bring the accounting policies of acquired businesses into alignment with those 
of the Group.
Goodwill on acquisitions of subsidiaries is included in intangible assets. Goodwill on acquisitions of associates and joint ventures 
is included in the carrying amount of the investment. Goodwill is stated at cost less any impairment. Goodwill is not amortised 
but is tested annually for impairment. An impairment charge is recognised for any amount by which the carrying value of goodwill 
exceeds its recoverable value.
Gains and losses on the disposal of an entity include the carrying amount of goodwill relating to the entity sold, allocated where 
necessary on a pro rata basis.
Other intangible assets
Intangible assets acquired as part of an acquisition of a business are capitalised separately from goodwill, if those assets are 
separable and their fair value can be measured reliably.
The cost of intangible assets with finite useful economic lives is amortised on a straight-line basis over that period. The carrying 
values of intangible assets are reviewed for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying values 
may not be recoverable.
Brand names
Legally protected or otherwise separable trade names acquired as part of a business combination are capitalised at fair value on 
acquisition. The fair value of brand names with finite useful economic lives is amortised on a straight-line basis over that period. 
Brand names that are assumed to have an indefinite life and are not amortised, but are subject to annual impairment tests.
Customer relationships
Contractual and non-contractual customer relationships acquired as part of a business combination are capitalised at fair value on 
acquisition and amortised on a straight-line basis over a period of between 2 and 20 years, representing the directors’ best estimate 
of their useful economic lives.
Financial instruments
Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised in the Group’s balance sheet when the Group becomes a party to the 
contractual provisions of the instrument. Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements

Financial assets
The Group’s financial assets are classified as either derivatives or “loans and receivables”. The classification depends on the nature 
and purpose of the financial assets and is determined at the time of initial recognition.
Effective interest method
The effective interest method is a method of calculating the amortised cost of a financial asset and of allocating interest income 
over the relevant period. The effective interest rate is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash receipts (including all 
fees paid or received that form an integral part of the effective interest rate, transaction costs and other premiums or discounts) 
through the expected life of the financial asset, or, where appropriate, a shorter period, to the principal amount.
Income is recognised on an effective interest basis for loans and receivables.
Loans and receivables
Trade receivables, loans, and other receivables that have fixed or determinable payments are classified as loans and receivables. 
Loans and receivables are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, less any impairment. Interest income 
is recognised by applying the effective interest rate, except for short-term receivables when the recognition of interest would be 
immaterial.
Impairment of financial assets
Loans and receivables are assessed for indicators of impairment at each balance sheet date. Financial assets are impaired where 
there is objective evidence that, as a result of one or more events that occurred after the initial recognition of the financial asset, 
the estimated future cash flows of the investment have been impacted.
Objective evidence of impairment could include:
• significant financial difficulty of the issuer or counterparty; or
• default or delinquency in interest or principal payments; or
• it becoming probable that the borrower will enter bankruptcy or financial reorganisation.
For trade receivables in Express Gifts, assets that are not individually significant are assessed for impairment on a collective basis. 
When assessing for collective impairment, the Group estimates incurred losses using a statistical model which multiplies the 
probability of default (“PD”) for each class of customer (using a balance scorecard for the relevant stage of debt) by the loss given 
default (“LGD”) multiplied by the exposure at default (“EaD”) to arrive at the projected expected loss. An emergence period is 
incorporated to provide the estimated level of incurred losses at each reporting date.
An adjustment is made to discount the expected cash flows from the impairment model, at the assets’ original EIR, to arrive at the 
recorded collective provisions.
The model’s results are adjusted for management’s judgement as to whether current economic, political and credit conditions are 
such that actual losses are likely to differ from those suggested by historical modelling, increasing model risk within the impairment.
The carrying amount of the financial asset is reduced by the impairment loss directly for all financial assets with the exception of trade 
receivables, where the carrying amount is reduced through the use of an allowance account. When a trade receivable is considered 
uncollectible, it is written off against the allowance account. Subsequent recoveries of amounts previously written off are credited 
against the allowance account. Changes in the carrying amount of the allowance account are recognised in profit or loss.
If, in a subsequent period, the amount of the impairment loss decreases and the decrease can be related objectively to an event 
occurring after the impairment was recognised, the previously recognised impairment loss is reversed through profit or loss to the 
extent that the carrying amount of the asset at the date the impairment is reversed does not exceed what the amortised cost would 
have been had the impairment not been recognised.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash on hand and demand deposits, and other short-term highly liquid investments that are 
readily convertible to a known amount of cash and are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value.
Derecognition of financial assets
The Group derecognises a financial asset only when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the asset expire; or it transfers 
the financial asset and substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the asset to another entity. If the Group neither 
transfers nor retains substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership and continues to control the transferred asset, the 
Group recognises its retained interest in the asset and an associated liability for amounts it may have to pay. If the Group retains 
substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of a transferred financial asset, the Group continues to recognise the financial 
asset and also recognises a collateralised borrowing for the proceeds received. 85

Financial liabilities and equity
Financial liabilities and equity instruments are classified according to the substance of the contractual arrangements entered into.
Equity instruments
An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of the Group after deducting all of its liabilities. 
Equity instruments issued by the Group are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
Where financial liabilities are extinguished by equity instruments issued the difference between the carrying value of the debt 
extinguished and the fair value of the equity instrument issued is recorded in the income statement.
Financial liabilities
The Group’s financial liabilities are classified as either “fair value through profit and loss” or “other financial liabilities”.
Other financial liabilities
Other financial liabilities, including borrowings, are initially measured at fair value, net of transaction costs. Other financial liabilities 
are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, with interest expense recognised on an effective 
yield basis. The effective interest method is a method of calculating the amortised cost of a financial liability and of allocating 
interest expense over the relevant period. The effective interest rate is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash 
payments through the expected life of the financial liability, or, where appropriate, a shorter period.
The Group derecognises financial liabilities when, and only when, the Group’s obligations are discharged, cancelled or they expire.
Derivative financial instruments
On initial designation of the derivative as the hedging instrument, the Group formally documents the relationship between the 
hedging instrument and hedged item, including the risk management objectives and strategy in undertaking the hedge transaction 
and the hedged risk, together with the methods that will be used to assess the effectiveness of the hedging relationship. The 
Group makes an assessment, both at the inception of the hedge relationship as well as on an ongoing basis, of whether the 
hedging instruments are expected to be “highly effective” in offsetting the changes in the fair value or cash flows of the respective 
hedged items attributable to the hedged risk, and whether the actual results of each hedge are within a range of 80 – 125%. For 
a cash flow hedge of a forecast transaction, the transaction should be highly probable to occur and should present an exposure to 
variations in cash flows that could ultimately affect reported profit or loss.
Derivatives are recognised initially at fair value; attributable transaction costs are recognised in profit or loss as incurred. Subsequent 
to initial recognition, derivatives are measured at fair value, and changes therein are accounted for as described below.
Cash flow hedges
When a derivative is designated as the hedging instrument in a hedge of the variability in cash flows attributable to a particular risk 
associated with a recognised asset or liability or a highly probable forecast transaction that could affect profit or loss, the effective 
portion of changes in the fair value of the derivative is recognised in other comprehensive income and presented in the hedging 
reserve in equity. Any ineffective portion of changes in the fair value of the derivative is recognised immediately in profit or loss. 
When the hedged item is a non-financial asset, the amount accumulated in equity is included in the carrying amount of the asset 
when the asset is recognised. In other cases the amount accumulated in equity is reclassified to profit or loss in the same period 
that the hedged item affects profit or loss. If the hedging instrument no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, expires or 
is sold, terminated or exercised, or the designation is revoked, then hedge accounting is discontinued prospectively. If the forecast 
transaction is no longer expected to occur, then the balance in equity is reclassified in profit or loss.
The Group enters into a variety of derivative financial instruments to manage its exposure to interest rate and foreign exchange rate 
risk, including foreign exchange forward contracts, interest rate caps and swaps and foreign currency options. Further details of 
derivative financial instruments are disclosed in note 20 to the financial statements.
Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value at the date a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently remeasured to 
their fair value at each balance sheet date. The resulting gain or loss is recognised in profit or loss immediately.
A derivative is presented as a non-current asset or a non-current liability if the remaining maturity of the instrument is more than 
12 months and it is not expected to be realised or settled within 12 months. Other derivatives are presented as current assets or 
current liabilities.
Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Cost is calculated on a weighted average cost basis, and where applicable includes those costs that have been incurred in bringing 
the inventories to their present location and condition.
Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less applicable variable selling expenses. Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements

Impairment of non-financial assets
Assets that have an indefinite useful life are not subject to amortisation but are tested annually for impairment. Assets that are 
subject to amortisation are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying 
amount may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is recognised for the amount by which the asset’s carrying amount exceeds 
its recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is the higher of an asset’s fair value less costs to sell and value in use. For the 
purposes of assessing impairment, assets are grouped at the lowest levels for which there are separately identifiable cash flows 
(cash-generating units).
Taxation
The tax currently payable or receivable is based on taxable profit or loss for the period. Taxable profit differs from net profit as 
reported in the income statement because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and 
it further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible. The Group’s liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that 
have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred taxation is provided in full on temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their 
carrying amounts in the consolidated financial statements. However, if the deferred taxation arises from initial recognition of an 
asset or liability in a transaction other than a business combination that at the time of the transaction affects neither accounting nor 
taxable profit or loss, it is not accounted for. No deferred tax liability is recognised in respect of the initial recognition of goodwill. 
Deferred taxation is calculated using tax rates that are expected to apply when the related deferred taxation asset is realised or the 
deferred taxation liability is settled.
Deferred taxation assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be available against which the 
temporary differences can be utilised.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset if there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax liabilities and assets, and they 
relate to income taxes levied by the same tax authority on the same taxable entity, or on different tax entities, but they intend to 
settle current tax liabilities and assets on a net basis or their tax assets and liabilities will be realised simultaneously.
Leases
Finance leases
Leases of property, plant and equipment where the Group has substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership are classified 
as finance leases. Finance leases are capitalised at the lease’s inception at the lower of the fair value of the leased property and 
the present value of the minimum lease payments. Each lease payment is allocated between the liability and finance charges so 
as to achieve a constant rate on the finance balance outstanding. The corresponding rental obligations, net of finance charges, are 
included in other long-term payables. The interest element of the finance cost is charged to the income statement over the lease 
period so as to produce a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability for each period. Property, plant 
and equipment acquired under finance leases is depreciated over the shorter of the anticipated useful life of the asset and its lease 
term.
Operating leases
Leases in which a significant proportion of the risks and rewards of ownership are retained by the lessor are classified as operating 
leases. Payments made under operating leases are charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the period of the 
lease. Incentives from lessors are recognised as a systematic reduction of the charge over the lease term.
Retirement benefit costs
The Group has both defined benefit and defined contribution plans. A defined benefit plan is a pension plan that defines an amount 
of pension benefit that an employee will receive on retirement, usually dependent on one or more factors such as age, years of 
service and compensation.
A defined contribution plan is a pension plan under which the Group pays fixed contributions into an independently administered 
fund. The Group has no legal or constructive obligations to pay further contributions if the fund does not hold sufficient assets to 
pay all employees the benefits relating to employee service in the current and prior periods. The cost of providing these benefits, 
recognised in the income statement, comprises the amount of contributions payable to the schemes in respect of the year.
For defined benefit retirement plans, the cost of providing benefits is determined using the Projected Unit Credit method, with 
actuarial valuations being carried out at each balance sheet date. 87

2 Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty
The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires management to make judgements, estimates 
and assumptions that affect the application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and 
expenses. Actual results may differ from these estimates.
Critical judgements in applying the Group’s accounting policies
In the process of applying the Group’s accounting policies, which are described in note 1, management has made the following 
judgements that have the most significant effect on the amounts recognised in the financial statements (apart from those involving 
estimates, which are dealt with below).
In implementing the new model for calculating impairment on trade receivables in Express Gifts, judgement has been applied in 
considering whether a prior period adjustment is required or whether the changes represent a change in estimate. This is discussed 
further in the section on ‘Change in accounting estimate’ below.
Key sources of estimation uncertainty
The key assumptions concerning the future, and other key sources of estimation uncertainty at the balance sheet date, that have 
a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year are 
as follows:
Valuation of indefinite lived intangibles and goodwill (note 13)
The Group has significant investments in indefinite lived intangible assets and goodwill at 31 March 2017 as a result of acquisitions 
of businesses and purchases of such assets. The carrying value of indefinite lived intangible assets at 31 March 2017 is £17.3m 
(2016: £21.2m) and, following the impairment recorded during the year, the carrying value of goodwill at 31 March 2017 is £nil 
(2016: £16.7m). These assets are held at cost less provisions for impairment and are tested annually for impairment. Tests for 
impairment are primarily based on the calculation of a value in use for each cash generating unit. This involves the preparation of 
discounted cash flow projections, which require an estimate of both future operating cash flows and an appropriate discount rate. 
Such estimates are inherently subjective and can have a material impact on the result of the impairment test.
Inventory provisioning (note 15)
The Group carries significant amounts of inventory against which there are provisions for slow moving and delisted products. 
At 31 March 2017 a provision of £1.9m (2016: £1.7m) is held against a gross inventory value of £59.0m (2016: £55.2m). The 
provisioning calculations require a high degree of judgement and the use of estimates around historical recovery rates for slow 
moving and delisted products.
Express Gifts’ trade receivables (note 16)
Express Gifts’ trade receivables are recognised on the balance sheet at original invoice amount less provisions for impairment. 
At 31 March 2017 trade receivables with a gross value of £270.1m (2016: £244.3m) were recorded on the balance sheet, less 
a provision for impairment of £83.5m (2016: £43.1m).
Provisions for impairment of receivables within Express Gifts are established when there is objective evidence that the Group will 
not be able to collect all amounts due. The provision for impairment represents management’s best estimate of losses incurred 
in the portfolio at the balance sheet date. In determining the required level of impairment provisions, the Group uses the output 
from a new statistical impairment model developed and implemented during FY17, which assesses the probability of default at 
a customer account level based on customer risk scoring, and uses this estimate of probability to calculate an estimated loss based 
on the level of exposure at the balance sheet date, adjusted for an estimate of future cash flows expected to be recovered from 
defaulted accounts.
Change in accounting estimate
As disclosed in last year’s annual report, during FY16 management commenced a comprehensive build of a new statistical model 
for calculating the impairment of trade receivables, which was completed during FY17. The new model has enabled management, 
at the FY17 year end, to assess impairment at an account level. In comparison to the model previously used by the Group, the 
new model allows for the calculation of a more precise impairment provision, based on the risk rating of individual customers. The 
impairment model used in prior years necessitated the estimate of impairment provisions based on an assessment of the population 
on a collective basis, which included the use of averages, based on historic roll rates and collection rates.
The granular information provided by the new model has also enabled management to have greater visibility over the impact of 
changes introduced to receivables collection processes by Express Gifts in recent periods, including the introduction of a strategy to 
pursue the sale of significantly overdue receivables to third-parties. As a result, management are able to predict with a greater level 
of accuracy, based on actual historical performance and specific customer behaviour, the level of provisions required, including for 
accounts in forbearance arrangements, and to factor in more balanced estimates of the Group’s experience of emergence periods. 
Management have also sought to reflect the impact of a more balanced approach to its debt sale strategy within the year end 
estimate, which includes assumptions around the future value, probability, and timing of the expected cash flows from the debt sales. Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements

2 Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty – continued
Following the adoption of the new model during FY17, there has been an increase in the impairment provision at March 2017 of 
£35.2m. This increase represents the impact of changes in accounting estimates since the prior year as a result of the ability to 
conduct a more granular account by account bad debt estimate, and additional information which became available during FY17. In 
assessing the appropriate treatment of this increase in provision, management has considered whether an adjustment to the level 
of provision recognised at 25 March 2016 and prior should be recognised as a prior period adjustment in accordance with IAS 8. As 
the additional provision has arisen from the development of the new model during the year, and is based on information which was 
not available to the Group in prior years, management has recognised the increase in the provision in the current year. Due to the 
scale of the charge, however, and as the charge does not relate to the current trading period, management has concluded that the 
additional charge should be separately disclosed as an individually significant item in the income statement.
Provisions for Financial Services redress (note 21)
In both the current and prior period, the Group made provisions in respect of redress and refunds for flawed financial services 
products. At 31 March 2017 a provision of £25.5m (2016: £15.3m) was recorded in the balance sheet. The provision amount 
represents an estimate of premiums, interest and fees to be refunded to customers, based on a review of affected customer 
accounts using an account level calculator developed for the exercise. The affected population falls into two broad categories; those 
who have a live relationship with the business and those that do not. The former group have largely been auto refunded however 
the remaining population, some of whom may not have traded with the business for a significant period, will be contacted in the 
coming months. In calculating the provision amount, an assumed response rate from this customer contact exercise has been 
assumed. An increase of 5% in this assumed response rate would increase the provision required by c. £0.8m. Assumptions have 
also been made over the effective interest rate applied to amounts to be refunded. A 0.6% increase in the effective interest rate 
assumed would increase the provision required by c. £0.2m.
Due to the scale of the charge required to be made for redress and refunds during the year, and that the issues to which the 
redress and refund programmes relate did not arise in the current trading period, management has concluded that the additional 
charge should be separately disclosed as an individually significant item in the income statement.
The carrying amounts of the assets and liabilities detailed above are sensitive to the underlying assumptions used by management 
in their calculation. It is reasonably possible that the outcomes within the next financial year could differ from the assumptions 
made, which would impact upon the carrying values assumed.
Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the 
period in which the estimates are revised and in any of the future periods affected. 89

5 Segmental analysis
Operating segments
The Board has considered the information that is presented to them on each of the trading divisions. In view of this, information on 
reporting segments has been presented accordingly. The Group is organised into three operating segments.
Continuing operations
• Express Gifts – direct mail order businesses in the UK, offering online and via catalogue a broad range of home and leisure 
items, clothing, toys and gifts supported by a flexible credit offer;
• Findel Education – supplier of resources and equipment (excluding information technology and publishing) to schools and 
educational establishments in the UK and overseas; and
• Overseas Sourcing – sourcing office based in Hong Kong supplying importing services to group companies and a small number 
of external customers.
Segment information about these operating segments is presented below. The prior period information includes information in 
respect of Kitbag Limited, which was regarded as a separate operating segment until its disposal on 1 February 2016.
Inter-segmental trading and profitability is not included in the information provided to the CODM and consequently is not disclosed

6 Individually significant items – continued
The directors consider that all items recorded within individually significant items warrant separate presentation in the income 
statement in order to fairly reflect the underlying performance of the Group.
Restructuring costs in the current period of £2,330,000 (2016: £2,347,000), of which £nil (2016: £698,000) related to discontinued 
operation, relate to management changes, the relocation of FASL’s Hong Kong offices, redundancies and costs associated with the 
relocation of the head office from Hyde to Accrington.
As highlighted in our 2016 Annual Report, we had set aside a provision of £14.4m in FY16 in respect of creating a provision for 
customer redress and refunds in respect of flawed financial services products, based upon estimates and assumptions that were 
subject to change. A pilot-scale contact programme for affected customers was completed in the first half of the financial year. 
Based on the findings from that programme and initial discussions with the FCA, a charge of £3.3m was recorded as part of the 
half year process. A more detailed analysis of the refund calculator and a review of the customer database in the second half of the 
financial year indicated that assumptions around the age and profile of balances to be refunded need to be corrected. As a result, 
an £11,000,000 increase to the provision was required, bringing the full charge for the year to £14,300,000 (see note 21). A further 
£400,000 was also provided in respect of the Plevin case.
A charge of £35,215,000 has been recorded in the current period in respect of a change in accounting estimate relating to 
receivables provisioning in Express Gifts. The charge in the current year relates to the adoption of a revised, granular trade 
receivables impairment model as referred to in more detail in note 2.
In the 52 week period ended 25 March 2016, costs of £367,000 were incurred in respect of the write-off of amounts due to Express 
Gifts from Findel plc’s former subsidiary Kleeneze Limited, which were assessed as irrecoverable. £133,000 has been recovered 
during in the 53 week period ended 31 March 2017 which has been credited to income statement.
Costs of £7,532,000 (which includes £48,000 in respect of fixed asset impairments) have been incurred in the current period in 
respect of an onerous lease provision for areas of Findel Education’s head office, which the business no longer occupies. Costs 
of £4,754,000 were provided in the prior period in respect of an onerous lease provision arising as a result of the consolidation of 
Findel Education’s warehousing operations from two sites to one. The prior period income statement charge was lower than the 
provision recorded due to the impact of the acceleration of a lease incentive, which was previously being released to the income 
statement of over the lifetime of the lease which expires in 2028. 
 
In the prior year to March 2016 an individually significant charge of £4,300,000 was recognised in respect of impairment provisioning 
on trade receivables in Express Gifts. This related to additional information that came to light following a review of the estimation 
models used for receivables provisioning, notably in relation to customers with whom forbearance arrangements, both with and 
without interest, have been entered into, as better information was available to allow an improved, more accurate, assessment of 
the level of provision required. Based on this improved information, an additional provision of £4,300,000 was recognised at March 
2016, of which c. £3,000,000 related to an adjustment to correct an area of previous non-compliance with IAS 39. Management 
concluded that the changes made would not, if they had been made during the year to March 2015, have had a material impact 
on that year’s income statement, as the level of provision at the beginning of 2014 would also have been similarly impacted. 
As a result, management considered it appropriate to recognise the additional £4,300,000 provision during 2016.
An impairment charge of £650,000 has been recognised in respect of the early retirement of Findel Education’s legacy web 
platforms.
Total charges of £21,178,000 have been recorded in the current period in respect of the impairment of goodwill and other intangible 
assets. Further detail of the results of the impairment review can be found in note 13.
The Board announced in July 2016 that it had received a proposal from Schroders plc, on behalf of Sports Direct International plc 
(SDI), to seek to appoint Mr Michael Ashley as Chairman of the Company in succession to David Sugden. Individually significant 
advisory costs totalling £680,000 have been incurred in the period in dealing with this proposal and other matters relating to SDI.
Following the refinancing of the Group’s bank and securitisation facilities in the prior period, costs of £998,000 were recognised in 
FY16 in respect of the write-off of the unamortised fees that were paid in respect of previous refinancing exercises in May 2014 
and January 2015.
Items specifically related to discontinued operations
In the prior period a loss of £4,782,000 was recorded in respect of the disposal of Kitbag Limited which was completed on 
1 February 2016. This loss included a charge of £1,584,000 in respect of deferred tax assets written off as a result of the disposal. Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements

7 Business Combination and Discontinued operations
Business Combination
Spa 4 Schools Limited (S4S)
During the period, the Group acquired 100% of the share capital and control of S4S for total consideration of £1,600,000. This 
constituted a business combination as defined by IFRS 3 and consequently goodwill of £628,000, being the difference between the 
fair value of the consideration payable and the fair value of the net assets acquired (see below), has been recognised.
Taking control of S4S allows Findel Education to protect its market share in Northern Ireland, and to gain access to S4S’s contracts 
with local Library Boards (Library Board contracts are required in order to trade with schools). In addition, there is a benefit from cost 
savings through economies of scale. For the period in which S4S was under the Group’s control it generated revenue of £392,000.
Consideration transferred
  £000
Cash  1,150
Deferred consideration  450
Total consideration transferred  1,600
The deferred consideration of £450,000 is contingent on the renewal of specific contracts with the Library Boards from January 
2018 onwards and has been recognised in the acquisition value as this is considered to be the fair value.
Acquisition-related costs
The Group incurred acquisition-related costs of £109,000 on legal fees and due diligence costs. These costs have been included in 
‘administrative expenses’.
Identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed
On acquisition, the Group acquired net assets with a fair value of £22,000. In addition, the Group recognised intangible assets of 
£950,000, in respect of the S4S brand name and customer relationships. Refer to note 13 for further details.
Goodwill
Goodwill arising from the acquisition has been recognised as follows.
Fair values at acquisition  £000
Consideration  1,600
Net assets acquired  (22)
Intangible assets recognised on acquisition  (950)
Goodwill  628
The goodwill is attributable mainly to the skills and tacit knowledge of S4S’s work force and the synergies expected to be achieved 
from integrating the company into the Group’s existing Education business.
Discontinued operations
Kitbag Limited (‘Kitbag’)
The Group completed the disposal of its sports retail division through the sale of Kitbag and its subsidiaries on 1 February 2016 to 
Fanatics UK Holdings Ltd, a subsidiary of Fanatics Inc.
The gross consideration received was £13.9m, which comprised an initial payment of £11.6m payable on completion, as well as 
a further £2.3m received on 20 April 2016 following the agreement of completion accounts. This was dependent upon the level 
of working capital at completion. The cash proceeds were used to further reduce the Group’s bank debt and to help drive further 
growth within the Group’s core businesses, Express Gifts and Findel Education. 
Kitbag’s results for the period from 28 March 2015 to 1 February 2016 were reported separately as a discontinued operation and are 
summarised as follows:

Goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated, at acquisition, to the cash generating units (CGUs) that are expected to 
benefit from that business combination. After recognition of impairment losses, the carrying amount of goodwill has been allocated 
as follows:
 2017 2016 
  £000 £000
Express Gifts — 320
Findel Education — 16,371
  — 16,691
During the period, the Group acquired 100% of the share capital and control of SPA 4 Schools Limited. Goodwill of £628,000, being 
the difference between the fair value of the consideration payable and the fair value of the net assets recognised at acquisition was 
recognised (see note 7). This goodwill was allocated to the Findel Education cash generating unit (CGU), which is the CGU that will 
benefit from the synergies of the combination.
Following the year end impairment review, the carrying amount of the Findel Education CGU was determined to be higher than the 
recoverable amount and an impairment loss of £19,800,000 was recognised. Consequently £16,999,000 of goodwill allocated to the 
Findel Education CGU was fully impaired.
£320,000 of goodwill allocated to the Express Gifts CGU was also impaired during the period, as this related to a brand which is no 
longer in use within the business and is therefore considered to have a fair value of £nil. 103

Brand names that are expected to be maintained indefinitely and are expected to continue to drive value for the Group are deemed 
to have an indefinite life, and are subject to annual impairment tests.
Upon the acquisition of SPA 4 Schools Limited, a brand name with a fair value of £500,000 was recognised, which will be amortised 
over a useful economic life of five years.
The amortisation period for customer relationships, which arose from the acquisition of businesses, is between 2 and 20 years. 
Management do not consider that any customer relationships are individually material.
Upon the acquisition of Spa 4 Schools Limited, customer relationships with a fair value of £450,000 were recognised, which will be 
amortised over a useful economic life of five years.
Brand names and customer relationships acquired in a business combination are allocated, at acquisition, to the CGUs that are 
expected to benefit from that business combination. After recognition of impairment losses, the carrying amount of brand names 
has been allocated as follows:

  £000 £000
Express Gifts — 1,058
Findel Education 17,791 20,102

Customer relationships are all allocated the Findel Education CGU.
(c) Impairment testing
The Group tests goodwill and indefinite lived brand names for impairment annually, or more frequently if there are indicators of 
impairment.
The recoverable amounts of the Express Gifts and Findel Education CGUs are determined from value in use calculations. Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements

Significant judgements, assumptions and estimates
In determining the value in use of CGUs it is necessary to make a series of assumptions to estimate the present value of future 
cash flows. In each case, these key assumptions have been made by management reflecting past experience, current trends, and 
where applicable, are consistent with relevant external sources of information. The key assumptions are as follows:
Operating cash flows
Management has prepared cash flow forecasts for a three year period derived from the approved budget for financial year 2017/18. 
These forecasts include assumptions around sales prices and volumes, specific customer relationships and operating costs and 
working capital movements.
Risk adjusted discount rates
The pre-tax rates used to discount the forecast cash flows were 12.0% (2016:12.0%) for the Express Gifts CGU and 17.9% (2016: 
15.0%) for the Findel Education CGU. These discount rates are derived from the Group’s weighted average cost of capital as 
adjusted for the specific risks related to each CGU.
Long-term growth rate
To forecast beyond the detailed cash flows into perpetuity, a long-term average growth rate of 1.9% (2016: 2.1%) has been used. 
This is not greater than the published International Monetary Fund average growth rate in gross domestic product for the next five 
year period in the territories where the CGUs operate. The growth rate was assessed separately for each CGU however the 1.9% 
rate was deemed appropriate in both cases.
Results
Following a management decision to discontinue the HHS brand and to focus on the more popular brands of Studio and Ace, 
the goodwill and indefinite lived brands allocated to the Express Gifts CGU, which entirely related to this brand, have been fully 
impaired. Allowing for this impairment, the estimated recoverable amount of the Express Gifts CGU exceeds the carrying value 
of its residual tangible asset base by approximately £19,016,000 (2016: £24,300,000).
The carrying amount of the Findel Education CGU was determined to be higher than the recoverable amount and consequently an 
impairment loss of £19,800,000 was recognised. The impairment loss was allocated against the remaining goodwill (£16,999,000) 
with the remainder against indefinite lived brand names. Following the impairment loss recognised, the recoverable amount is 
equal to the carrying amount. Therefore, any adverse movement in a key assumption would lead to a further impairment. Sensitivity 
analysis is included below.
Sensitivity analysis
The results of the Group’s impairment tests are dependent upon estimates and judgements made by management, particularly in 
relation to the key assumptions described above. Sensitivity analysis to potential changes in operating cash flows and risk adjusted 
discount rates has therefore been reviewed.
The table below shows the risk adjusted discount rate and forecast operating cash flow assumptions used in the calculation of value 
in use for the Findel Education CGU and the change to the level of impairment indicated by changes in these assumptions:
  Findel Education
Impairment recognised in the period (£000)  19,800
Assumptions used in the calculation of value in use
Pre-tax discount rate  17.9%
Total pre-discounted forecast operating cash flow (£000)  57,200
Additional impairment required as a result of changes to key assumptions
0.5% increase in the pre-tax discount rate  (1,600)
£500k pa decrease in total pre-discounted forecast operating cash flow  (3,600)
Reduction in impairment required as a result of changes to key assumptions
0.5% decrease in the pre-tax discount rate  1,700
£500k pa increase in total pre-discounted forecast operating cash flow  3,600
Based on the results of the impairment test for the Express Gifts CGU, management are satisfied that there is sufficient headroom 
against the residual tangible asset base such that a reasonably possible change in assumption would not lead to an impairment. 
Consequently, no sensitivity analysis has been disclosed. 105

Certain of the Group’s trade receivables are funded through a securitisation facility arranged by HSBC Bank plc and funded through 
a vehicle owned by GRE Trust Company (Ireland) Limited. The facility is secured against those receivables and is without recourse 
to any of the Group’s other assets. The finance provider will seek repayment of the finance, as to both principal and interest, only 
to the extent that collections from the receivables financed allows and the benefit of additional collections remains with the Group, 
since the assets are charged but not transferred. At the period end, receivables of £200,753,000 (2016: £181,565,000) were funded 
through the securitisation facility, and the facilities utilised were £142,534,000 (2016: £128,911,000).
Due to the different nature of debtors within the Express Gifts operating segment compared to that in the rest of the Group, the 
following analysis on trade receivables has been split between Express Gifts and the rest of the Group.
Express Gifts
The average credit period taken on sales of goods is 226 days (2016: 237 days). Interest is charged at 3.1% (2016: 3.1%) per month 
on the outstanding balance.
Provisions for impairment of receivables within Express Gifts are established when there is objective evidence that the Group will 
not be able to collect all amounts due. The provision for impairment represents management’s best estimate of losses incurred 
in the portfolio at the balance sheet date. In determining the required level of impairment provisions, the Group uses the output 
from a new statistical impairment model developed and implemented during FY17, which assesses the probability of default at a 
customer account level based on customer risk scoring, and uses this estimate of probability to calculate an estimated loss based 
on the level of exposure at the balance sheet date, adjusted for an estimate of future cash flows expected to be recovered from 
defaulted accounts. An emergence period is incorporated to provide the estimated level of incurred losses at each reporting date.
Sensitivity analysis
Management judgement is required in setting assumptions around probabilities of default, cash recoveries and the emergence 
period which have a material impact on the results indicated by the model.
A 1% increase/decrease in the probability of default would increase the provision amount by approximately £1.6m.
A 1p increase in the assumed recoveries rate would result in the impairment provision decreasing by approximately £0.3m.
A one month increase/decrease in the assumed emergence period would result in the impairment provision increasing/decreasing 
by approximately £3m-£3.5m.
Before accepting any new customer, the Group uses an external credit scoring system to assess the potential customer’s credit 
quality and defines credit limits by customer. Limits and scoring attributed to customers are continually reviewed. There are no 
customers who represent more than 1% of the total balance of the Group’s trade receivables. 107

16 Trade and other receivables – continued
Rest of Group
The average credit period taken on sales of goods is 28 days (2016: 29 days). Trade receivables are provided for based on estimated 
irrecoverable amounts from the sale of goods, determined by reference to past default experience.
Given the nature of the public sector customer base within the Findel Education business segment, it is not considered necessary 
to utilise formal credit scoring. However, credit references are sought for all new customers prior to extending credit. There are no 
customers who represent more than 1% of the total balance of the Group’s trade receivables.
Included in the rest of the Group’s trade receivable balance are debtors with a carrying amount of £184,000 (2016: £283,000) which 
are past due at the reporting date which are partially provided against. There has not been a significant change in credit quality and 
the amounts are still considered recoverable. The Group does not hold any collateral over these balances. The average age of these 
receivables is 150 days (2016: 150 days).

In determining the recoverability of a trade receivable the Group considers any change in the credit quality of the trade receivable 
from the date credit was initially granted up to the reporting date. The Group has no significant concentration of credit risk, with 
exposure spread over a large number of counterparties and customers.
The directors consider that the Group’s maximum exposure to credit risk is the carrying value of the trade and other receivables and 
that their carrying amount approximates their fair value.
The Group uses a number of forbearance measures to assist those customers approaching, or at the point of experiencing, financial 
difficulties. Such measures include arrangement to pay less than the minimum payment and the suspension of interest charges 
to help the customer pay off their debt. We expect customers to resume normal payments where they are able. At the balance 
sheet date forbearance measures were in place on 35,716 accounts (2016: 35,729) with total gross balances of £22,859,000 
(2016: £18,250,000). Provisions are assessed as detailed above.
During the current period, overdue receivables with a gross value of £25,993,000 (2016: £108,217,000) were sold to third party debt 
collection agencies. As a result of the sales, the contractual rights to receive the cash flows from these assets were transferred to 
the purchasers. The proceeds received was broadly equal to the carrying value in both periods and consequently no profit or loss on 
disposal was recognised in either the current or prior period.

The average interest rates paid on the loans were as follows:

*  The average interest rates quoted in the current and prior period includes fees relating to the extension of the Group’s lending facilities (described below). 
The average interest rate excluding these fees was 3.35% (2016: 3.46%).
All bank loans are arranged at floating rates, thus exposing the Group to cash flow interest rate risk. The Group manages this risk 
by undertaking interest rate hedging as described in note 20.
All the bank loans are denominated in sterling.
The directors consider that the carrying value of bank loans approximates their fair value.
The Group agreed a new four year rolling credit facility with its lenders on 24 November 2015 maturing in November 2019. The 
facility was initially set at £120m but reduced to £113.6m on 29 April 2016 following the sale of Kitbag. It was reduced to £110m 
on 31 March 2017 and will decrease by £10m per annum each year thereafter.
The securitisation facility is coterminous with the revolving credit facility. The facility limit was increased to £155,000,000 on 
30 November 2016 and remained at that level at 31 March 2017 (2016: £145,000,000).
The Group incurred individually significant finance costs in the prior period of £998,000 in respect of the write-off of the unamortised 
fees that were paid in respect of previous refinancing exercises in May 2014 and January 2015, since the November 2015 
refinancing was accounted for as an extinguishment of the old facility in accordance with IAS 39.

Onerous leases
A provision was made in the current and prior periods for onerous leases in regards to vacated leasehold properties. The amount 
provided in the current year is in respect of additional unoccupied sections of the Group’s Hyde premises, which became 
unoccupied as part of the restructuring in the current year. The provision is expected to be utilised over the remaining lease term 
of approximately seventeen years. Because of the long term nature of the liability, the cash flows have been discounted using a 
discount rate that reflects the risks inherent in the future cash flows. Cash outflows have been discounted at a risk free rate of 3%. 
No cash inflows have been assumed.
In the prior year, the amount provided relates to the onerous lease provision arising as a result of the consolidation of Findel 
Education’s warehousing operations from two sites to one and unoccupied sections of the Group’s Hyde premises. The provision 
was calculated as the net of the remaining unavoidable lease rentals, less an assumed level of sublet income (sublet income 
assumed on the vacant warehouse only). The provision is expected to be utilised over the remaining lease terms of approximately 
eleven years (for the warehouse) and approximately seventeen years (for the Group’s Hyde premises). Because of the long-term 
nature of the liability, the cash flows were discounted using a discount rate that reflects the risks inherent in the future cash flows. 
Cash outflows have been discounted at a risk free rate of 3%, whilst the inflows have been discounted at 6%. The level of sublet 
income and discount rates used continue to reflect management’s best estimates.
Express Gifts financial services redress and refunds
In both the current and prior periods, a provision was made in respect of redress and refunds for flawed financial services products. 
Further details in respect of the amount provided in the current period can be found in note 6. The provision is expected to be 
utilised within 12 months.
Restructuring provision
A provision has been made in the current period in respect of the restructuring exercise undertaken to relocate the head office 
function from Hyde to Express Gifts’ offices in Accrington. The provision is expected to be utilised within the next 12 months. Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements

The following is the analysis of the deferred tax balances (before offset) for balance sheet purposes:

Deferred tax assets (12,191) (5,452)

Reductions in the UK corporation tax rate from 20% to 19% (effective from 1 April 2017) and to 18% (effective 1 April 2020) were 
substantively enacted on 26 October 2015, and an additional reduction to 17% (effective 1 April 2020) was substantively enacted on 
6 September 2016. This will reduce the Group’s future current tax charge.
Recognition of deferred tax assets is based on management’s assumptions that it is probable that the entities will have taxable 
profits against which the unused tax losses and deductible temporary timing differences can be utilised. Generally, in determining 
the amounts of deferred tax assets to be recognised, management uses profitability information and forecasted operating results 
based on approved business plans.
The aggregate value of deferred tax assets which have not been recognised is £9,425,000 (2016: £6,115,000). These amounts 
primarily relate to carried forward tax losses. No asset has been recognised in respect of these differences because there is 
insufficient evidence that the relevant subsidiaries will make suitable future taxable profits against which these assets may be 
utilised.

(i) Description of scheme
The Group has issued to certain senior employees nil cost options under the Performance Share Plan (PSP) that require the Group 
to award shares to the employee on the vesting of the award subject to the achievement of certain predetermined performance 
conditions. The performance period in respect of all outstanding awards is three years after the awards were granted.
The performance conditions that apply to the awards granted since July 2013 have been based upon the following bases:
• Awards made between July 2013 and December 2013: half linked to the absolute share price in the three months to March 
2016 and half linked to the adjusted earnings per share for the year to 25 March 2016.
• Awards made during FY15 were subject to a number of vesting criteria, including division-specific criteria for divisional 
management. The criteria applicable to the Executive Directors were that half the awards were linked to the share price in the 
three months to March 2018 and half linked to the adjusted earnings per share for the year to March 2018.
• Awards made during FY16 were subject to a number of vesting criteria, including division-specific criteria for divisional 
management. The criteria applicable to the Executive Directors were linked to the share price in the three months to March 
2019 and are subject to an underpin linked to the adjusted earnings per share for the year to March 2019.
• Awards made during FY17 were subject to a number of vesting criteria, including division-specific criteria for divisional 
management. The criteria applicable to the Executive Directors were linked to the share price in the three months to March 
2020 and are subject to an underpin linked to the adjusted earnings per share for the year to March 2020.
(ii) Measurement of fair values
The estimated fair value of the awards granted during the period is £1,809,000 (2016: £1,517,000). In each case these costs are 
expensed over the three years from the date of the relevant grant.
The fair values of the awards in the current period and prior year were calculated using a Stochastic valuation (aka “Monte-Carlo”) or 
Black-Scholes valuation model. The inputs into the models were as follows:
 2017 2016
Weighted average fair value (p) 146.5 112.5
Share price at issue (p) 159.7 197.5
Weighted average exercise price (p) — —
Expected volatility (%)  40.9 40.9
Expected life (years) 3.0 3.0
Risk free rate (%) 0.6 0.6
Expected dividend yield (%) — —
Expected volatility was determined by calculating the historical volatility of the Group’s share price over the previous three years.
(iii) Reconcilliation of outstanding options
 2017 2016 
  No. of shares No. of shares
Outstanding at the beginning of the period 3,142,072 5,425,216

Exercised during the period — (1,024,177)
Outstanding at the end of the period 3,037,183 3,142,072
The weighted average exercise price of all options is £nil.
The weighted average share price at the date of exercise for share options exercised in the prior period was £2.02.
(iv) Charge recognised in the income statement
The Group recognised a charge of £191,000 (2016: £239,000) related to equity-settled share-based payment transactions in the year 
reflecting the charge arising in the period being offset by the reversal of charges on non-market related performance criteria share 
options which are no longer expected to vest. Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements

Capital reduction
In the prior year, at the Annual General Meeting of the Company held on 30 July 2015, a special resolution was passed approving 
the cancellation of all amounts standing to the credit of the Company’s share premium account and capital redemption reserve, 
along with the reduction of the nominal value of the ordinary share capital of the Company to 10p per ordinary share (“Capital 
Reduction”), subject to the approval of the Court. Court approval was obtained and following the subsequent registration of the 
Court order with the Registrar of Companies, the Capital Reduction became effective on 15 March 2016. 
The impact of the capital reduction on equity in 2016 is summarised as follows:

that: (i) the Company’s volume weighted average ordinary share price rises above 479.4p for a period of one month during the 
period commencing on 22 March 2013 and ending on 22 March 2021; (ii) an offer is made for the Company (regardless of the 
share performance of the Company).
• The holders of the shares are entitled to attend but not vote at the general meetings (save in respect of any resolution relating 
to the convertible shares).
• The shares may participate in dividends or other distributions declared in excess of 50% of the net income in a particular 
accounting reference period.
• The shares are freely transferable and the terms may be varied only with the approval of 85% of the convertible shareholders.
If the shares have not been converted by 22 March 2021 they will automatically convert into non-voting deferred shares. The 
Company will have the right to buy back such deferred shares for a nominal value at that time.
25 Capital commitments
At 31 March 2017, amounts contracted for but not provided in the financial statements in respect of property, plant and equipment

During the period £16,757,000 (2016: £14,078,000) was recognised as an expense in the consolidated income statement 
in respect of operating leases, of which £7,484,000 (2016: £4,754,000) related to onerous lease provisions (see individually 
significant items – note 6). Included in the prior period figure was £764,000 related to the discontinued operation.
27 Pensions
Defined contribution schemes
The Group operates a defined contribution retirement benefit plan for all qualifying employees. The assets of the plan are held 
separately from those of the Group in funds under the control of trustees. The only obligation of the Group with respect to the 
retirement benefit plan is to make the specified contributions. The total expense recognised in the income statement of £1,518,000 
(2016: £1,518,000) represents contributions payable at rates specified by the rules of the plan.
Defined benefit schemes
The Group sponsors the Findel Group Pension Fund which is a defined benefit pension scheme with four sections. The four 
sections were merged into a single scheme on 30 June 2012 with the aim of reducing administrative costs. Findel plc (the 
parent company) is the principal sponsor of two of the sections, the Galt and Group sections, whilst Findel Education Limited 
(a subsidiary of Findel plc) is the principal sponsor of the Findel Education and Philip and Tacey sections. The scheme is closed 
to future accrual. The latest triennial valuation of the scheme was completed at 5 April 2016 by Barnett Waddingham using a 
“market related basis” method. The principal actuarial assumptions adopted in that valuation were a pre-retirement discount 
rate of 4.05% per annum and a post retirement discount rate of 2.55% per annum. The actuarial value of the assets was 
sufficient to cover 85% of the benefits that had accrued to members, after allowing for expected future increases in pensionable 
remuneration. The market value of the scheme’s assets at the date of valuation was £129.2m. The next formal valuation is due 
with an effective date no later than 5 April 2019.
The most recent valuation of the plan for IAS 19 purposes was carried out at 31 March 2017 by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP. The 
present value of the defined benefit obligation was measured using the projected unit credit method. The results of the IAS 19 
valuation are summarised as follows:
 2017 2016 
  £000 £000
Fair value of scheme assets 147,349 127,241
Present value of funded obligations (152,764) (129,535)
Deficit in the scheme (5,415) (2,294)
The weighted average duration of the Scheme’s IAS 19 liabilities is 18.1 years.

Actuarial Assumptions
The following are the principal actuarial assumptions at the reporting date:
 2017 2016
Financial Assumptions
Discount rate for scheme liabilities 2.60% 3.60%
RPI Price Inflation 3.30% 3.00%
CPI Price Inflation 2.30% 2.00%
Rate of increase to pensions in payment in line with RPI inflation (up to 5% per annum) 3.20% 3.00%
Rate of increase to pensions in payment in line with CPI inflation (up to 5% per annum) 2.30% 2.00%
Rate of increase to deferred pensions 2.30% 2.00%
Post retirement mortality (in years)
Current pensioners at 65 – male 87.4 yrs 87.2 yrs
Current pensioners at 65 – female 89.6 yrs 89.6 yrs
Future pensioners at 45 – male 89.2 yrs 88.9 yrs
Future pensioners at 45 – female 91.4 yrs 91.5 yrs
Demographic Assumptions
Cash Commutation (members taking cash lump sum) 80% 80%
Proportion of members that are married at retirement 75% 75%
Proportion of members taking TPIE option* 15% 15%
Age at which members are assumed to take TPIE option* 62.5 yrs 62.5 yrs
Assumptions regarding post retirement mortality are based on published statistics and mortality tables – S2NXA – CMI 2015 1.25% 
p.a. (2016: S1NXA – CMI 2015 1.25% p.a.)
* The Scheme now has an embedded option at retirement for members to take TPIE (Total Pension Increase Exchange), following the bulk exercise carried out in 
late 2014 and early 2015. Since this option is now a formalised process, allowance has been made for this in calculating the IAS 19 liability. A 15% take up at an 
average age of 62.5 years has been assumed, based upon take up rates seen to date.
Sensitivities
The sensitivities regarding the principal assumptions used to measure the scheme liabilities are set out below:
  Impact on scheme liabilities
Assumption Change in assumption If assumption increases If assumption decreases
Discount rate 0.5% Decrease by 8.3% Increase by 9.4%
RPI Inflation 0.5% Increase by 4.0% Decrease by 3.5%
CPI Inflation 0.5% Increase 1.2% Decrease by 0.9%
Salary increase 0.5% No change No change
Longevity 1 year Increase by 4.5% Decrease by 4.6%
TPIE take up % 5% Decrease by £150,000 Increase by £150,000
TPIE age 1 year Increase by £500,000 Decrease by £500,000
The above sensitivities are approximate and show the likely increase to the Scheme’s liabilities under IAS 19 if an assumption is 
adjusted whilst all other assumptions remain the same. The sensitivities are for illustration purposes only and do not necessarily 
represent the directors’ view of the expected changes to the assumptions in the future.
There have been no changes to the methods and assumptions used to calculate the sensitivity analyses between the current period 
and prior period. Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements

Risks
Investment risk
Allowance is made in the assumptions for the expected long-term performance of asset classes such as equities. There is a 
risk that these returns will not be achieved in practice, which would result in an increase in the Scheme’s liabilities and further 
contributions being required. Further, the value of the Scheme’s assets may not move in line with the Scheme’s liabilities – either 
because the Scheme invests in volatile assets whose value might fall, or because the value of the liabilities has increased due to 
falling interest rates and the assets are not of sufficient duration to keep up (or a combination of these).
Inflation
In projecting the expected future benefit payments, assumptions are made regarding future price inflation. There is a risk that the 
actual rate of inflation will be higher than assumed which will increase the cost of providing the benefits and thus the liability. This 
would result in additional contributions being required and a deterioration in the solvency position unless investment returns are 
similarly higher than expected.
Mortality
It is not possible to predict with any certainty how long members of the Scheme will live, and if members live longer than expected, 
additional contributions will be required and the Scheme’s solvency position will deteriorate.
Managing risk
To manage the risk of the Scheme, a TPIE exercise was carried out during 2015, which resulted in a number of members 
transferring out of the Scheme. The TPIE option has now been embedded within the scheme.
IFRIC 14
IFRIC 14 is an interpretation relating to IAS 19 that covers whether pension scheme surpluses can be recognised on the balance 
sheet. Based on the circumstances of the Fund and in line with the prior period, management do not believe that IFRIC 14 impacts 
the IAS 19 results since the Company has a right to a refund of surplus assets at some point in the future, and as such have not 
made any adjustments to the results.
Funding
The Scheme is funded by Findel plc and its subsidiaries. During the current period, the Group contributed £2,291,000 to the scheme 
(2016: £2,500,000). The Group expects to make contributions of £2,500,000 in the financial year ended March 2018, in line with the 
agreed schedule of contributions.
The following table shows the expected future payments for the Findel Group Pension Fund:

28 Financial instruments
The Group holds and uses financial instruments to finance its operations and to manage its interest rate and liquidity risks. The 
Group primarily finances its operations using share capital and borrowings. The main risks arising from the Group’s financial 
instruments are credit, interest rate, foreign currency and liquidity risk.
The Board reviews and agrees the policies for managing each of these risks on an annual basis. A full description of the Group’s 
approach to managing these risks is set out on pages 22 and 24.
The Group does not engage in trading or speculative activities using derivative financial instruments. A Group offset arrangement 
exists for cash balances to take advantage of the most rewarding short-term investment opportunities.
Capital risk management
The Group manages its capital to ensure that the Group will be able to continue as a going concern while maximising the return to 
stakeholders through the optimisation of the net debt and equity balance. The board of directors reviews the capital structure of 
the Group regularly considering both the costs and risks associated with each class of capital. The capital structure of the Group 
consists of:

Revolving credit facility
The Group is subject to two financial covenants based on debt based ratios (Interest Cover and Net Debt: EBITDA). These 
covenants are tested quarterly against pre-agreed limits.
Securitisation facility
The Group is subject to a number of covenants in relation to the quality of receivables securitised, of which the principal measures 
are the collection ratio, the default ratio, the excess spread ratio and the dilution ratio. The covenants are tested monthly against 
pre-agreed targets, testing for compliance on a three month rolling basis.
Significant accounting policies
Details of the significant accounting policies and methods adopted, including the criteria for recognition, the basis of measurement 
and the basis on which income and expenses are recognised, in respect of each class of financial asset, financial liability and equity

Basis for determining fair values
The following summarises the principal methods and assumptions used in estimating the fair value of financial instruments reflected 
in the table above:
(a) Derivatives
Broker quotes are used for all interest rate swaps, caps and foreign currency exchange contracts where relevant.
(b) Interest-bearing loans and borrowings
Fair value is calculated based on discounted expected future principal and interest cash flows.
(c) Trade and other receivables/payables
Trade receivables are stated net of allowance for doubtful debts where applicable, which in respect of Express Gifts is determined 
by reference to past default experience.
The main risks arising from the Group’s financial instruments are credit, interest rate, foreign currency, and liquidity risk. The Board 
reviews and agrees the policies for managing each of these risks on an annual basis.
Fair value hierarchy
The different levels of valuation method for financial instruments carried at fair value have been defined as follows:
Level 1: quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities
Level 2: inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly 
(i.e., as prices) or indirectly (i.e., derived from prices)
Level 3: inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs).
The derivative financial instruments held by the Group at 31 March 2017, namely the interest rate caps and forward foreign 
exchange contracts, were valued under level 2 measurement bases. The Group held no derivative financial instruments at 25 March 
2016.
Financial risk management objectives
The Group’s financial risks include market risk (including currency risk and interest risk), credit risk, liquidity risk and cash flow 
interest rate risk.
The Group seeks to minimise the effects of these risks by using derivative financial instruments to manage its exposure. The use of 
financial derivatives is governed by the Group’s policies approved by the board of directors.
Market risk
The Group’s activities expose it primarily to the financial risks of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. 
The Group enters into a variety of derivative financial instruments to manage its exposure to interest rate and foreign currency risk, 
including:
• forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge the exchange rate risk arising on the purchase of inventory principally in US dollars; 
and
• interest rate caps to mitigate the risk of rising interest rates. 121

Foreign currency risk management
A proportion of the products sold through the Express Gifts and Findel Education are procured through the Group’s Overseas 
Sourcing division. The currency of purchase for these goods is principally the US Dollar, with a proportion being in Hong Kong 
Dollars. Hence, exposures to exchange rate fluctuations arise. Exchange rate exposures are managed utilising forward foreign 
exchange contracts. The Group has a policy of hedging these foreign currency denominated transactions by entering into forward 
exchange purchase contracts for the purchases forecast for the next 12 months. At the balance sheet date, details of the notional 
value of outstanding US dollar forward foreign exchange contracts that the Group has committed to are as follows:

Less than 6 months 28,687 —
6 to 12 months 12,350 —
12 to 18 months — —
At the end of the period 41,037 —
Forward contracts outstanding at the period end are contracted at US dollar exchange rates between £1/$1.48 and £1/$1.23. Hedge 
accounting has not been applied to these derivatives.
The carrying amounts of the Group’s foreign currency denominated monetary assets and monetary liabilities at the reporting date 
are as follows:

Foreign currency sensitivity analysis
A significant proportion of products sold through Express Gifts and Findel Education are procured through the Group’s Far East 
buying office. The currency of purchase for these goods is principally the US dollar, with a proportion being in Hong Kong dollars.
The following table details the Group’s sensitivity to a 10% increase or decrease in the Sterling against the relevant foreign 
currencies. 10% represents management’s assessment of the reasonably possible change in foreign exchange rates. The sensitivity 
analysis includes only outstanding foreign currency denominated monetary items and adjusts their translation at the period end for 
a 10% change in foreign currency rates. The sensitivity analysis includes external loans as well as loans to foreign operations within 
the Group where the denomination of the loan is in a currency other than the currency of the lender or the borrower. A positive 
number below indicates an increase in profit and other equity where Sterling strengthens 10% against the relevant currency. For 
a 10% weakening of Sterling against the relevant currency, there would be an equal and opposite impact on the profit and other 
equity, and the balances below would be negative.

Forward foreign exchange contracts
The Group enters into forward foreign exchange contracts to manage the risk associated with anticipated sales and purchase 
transactions on a rolling twelve-month basis following a revision to its policy in April 2016.
At 31 March 2017, the Group was committed to forward foreign exchange contracts for a notional sterling contract value of 
£41,037,000.

Interest rate risk management
The Group is exposed to interest rate risk as the Group borrows funds at floating interest rates. The risk is managed by the Group 
by the use of interest rate cap contracts when considered necessary. The Group had two interest rate caps in place at 31 March 
2017. There were no interest rate caps in place at 25 March 2016. Hedging activities are evaluated regularly to align with interest 
rate views and defined risk appetite; ensuring hedging strategies are applied, by either positioning the balance sheet or protecting 
interest expense through different interest rate cycles.
The Group’s exposures to interest rates on financial assets and financial liabilities are detailed in the liquidity risk management 
section of this note.
Interest rate sensitivity analysis
The sensitivity analyses below have been determined based on the exposure to interest rates for both derivatives and non-derivative 
instruments at the balance sheet date. For floating rate liabilities, the analysis is prepared assuming the amount of liability outstanding at 
balance sheet date was outstanding for the whole year. A 50 basis point increase or decrease is used when reporting interest rate risk 
internally to key management personnel and represents management’s assessment of the reasonably possible change in interest rates.
If interest rates had been 50 basis points higher/lower and all other variables were held constant, the Group’s profit and equity 
reserves for the period ended 31 March 2017 would decrease/increase by £1,256,000 (2016: £1,136,000). This is mainly attributable 
to the Group’s exposure to interest rates on its variable rate borrowings.
Interest rate cap contracts
Under interest rate cap contracts, the Group agrees to cap the LIBOR element of its interest cost at an agreed level calculated on 
agreed notional principal amounts. Such contracts enable the Group to mitigate the risk of rising interest rates on its variable rate debt.
The following caps were in place at 31 March 2017:

The Group has two caps in place. The first was purchased on 4 May 2016 and matures in October 2017. The second cap was 
purchased on 17 February 2017 and matures in November 2018. both caps were designated as cash flow hedges from inception 
in accordance with IAS 39. The movement in the fair value of interest rate caps during the current and prior period was as follows:

Credit risk management
Credit risk refers to the risk that a counterparty will default on its contractual obligations resulting in financial loss to the Group. 
The Group’s credit risk is primarily attributable to its trade receivables. The amounts presented in the balance sheet are net of 
allowances for doubtful receivables. An allowance for impairment is made when there is an identified loss event which, based on 
previous experience, is evidence of a reduction in the recoverability of the cash flows. A more detailed commentary of the Group’s 
exposure to credit risk within its trade receivables, and the procedures employed to manage this risk, is set out in note 16.
The Group does not have any significant credit risk exposure to any single counterparty or any group of counterparties having similar 
characteristics. The Group defines counterparties as having similar characteristics if they are connected entities. Concentration of 
credit did not exceed 5% of gross monetary assets at any time during the year. The credit risk on liquid funds and derivative financial 
instruments is limited because the counterparties are banks with high credit-ratings assigned by international credit-rating agencies.
The carrying amount of financial assets recorded in the financial statements, which is net of impairment losses, represents the 
directors’ best estimate of the Group’s maximum exposure to credit risk without taking account of the value of any collateral obtained.
Liquidity risk management
Ultimate responsibility for liquidity risk management rests with the board of directors, which has built an appropriate liquidity risk 
management framework for the management of the Group’s short, medium and long-term funding and liquidity management 
requirements. The Group manages liquidity risk by maintaining adequate reserves, banking facilities and reserve borrowing facilities 
by continuously monitoring forecast and actual cash flows and matching the maturity profiles of financial assets and liabilities. 
Included in note 19 is a description of additional undrawn facilities that the Group has at its disposal to further reduce liquidity risk. 123

The Group has access to financing and securitisation facilities, the total unused amount of which was £nil* (2016: £nil) at the balance 
sheet date. The Group expects to meet its other obligations from operating cash flows. Borrowings drawn under the Group’s revolving 
credit facilities are shown above as being repaid within one year as drawings are made on one month loan periods. The Group may 
then redraw these amounts until the contractual maturity of the underlying facility which expires in November 2019.
The Group enters into derivative financial instruments relating to gross settled foreign exchange contracts and net settled interest 
rate caps. When the amount payable or receivable is not fixed, the amount disclosed has been determined by reference to the 
interest and foreign currency rates prevailing at the balance sheet date.
*  This figure represents drawn headroom against the available facilities. Total headroom (i.e., including cash and cash equivalents) 31 March 2017 is £29,173,000 
(2016: £34,405,000).
29 Related parties
During the prior period, the Group paid operating lease rentals to a company under the control of one of the Group’s major shareholders, 
Toscafund Asset Management LLP (“Toscafund”) in respect of a building formerly utilised by the Group. The operating lease rentals 
paid in respect of this property during prior period were £135,000. On 8 July 2016, the Group entered into an agreement to surrender 
the lease and paid a premium of £946,524 in this regard. No amounts were accrued at 31 March 2017 or 25 March 2016.
Transactions between the Company and its subsidiaries, which are related parties of the Company, have been eliminated on 
consolidation and are not discussed in this note. All transactions and outstanding balances between the group companies are priced 
on an arms-length basis and are to be settled in the ordinary course of business.

1 Significant accounting policies
Basis of accounting
Findel plc is a public limited company incorporated in England. The results of Findel plc are included in the consolidated 
accounts of Findel plc which are available from 2 Gregory St, Hyde, SK14 4TH, United Kingdom. These financial statements 
present information about the Company as an individual undertaking and not about its Group. The separate financial statements 
of the Company are prepared in accordance with Financial Reporting Standard 101 Reduced Disclosure Framework (“FRS 101”) 
and the Companies Act 2006.
The Company’s accounts are prepared using the recognition principles of EU-adopted IFRS but make amendments where necessary 
in order to comply with Companies Act 2006.
In these financial statements, the Company has applied the exemptions available under FRS 101 in respect of the following 
disclosures:
• Company cash flow statement and related notes
• Disclosures in respect of transactions with wholly owned subsidiaries
• Disclosures in respect of capital management
• The effects of new but not yet effective IFRSs
• Disclosures in respect of the compensation of key management personnel
As the consolidated financial statements of Findel plc include equivalent disclosures, the Company has also taken exemptions under 
FRS 101 available in respect of the following disclosures:
• Certain disclosures required by IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement
• Disclosures required by IFRS 7 Financial Instrument Disclosures
• Share-based payments – IFRS2 is being applied to equity instruments that were granted after 7 November 2002 and that had 
not vested by 28 March 2014.
The accounts are presented in Sterling, rounded to the nearest thousand.
Significant accounting policies
The accounting policies adopted by the Company are consistent with those used in the Group’s consolidated financial statements as 
set out on page 74 to 123, except for the following items which are only relevant for the Company as a standalone entity.
Investment properties
Investment properties (which include land and buildings) are stated at cost, net of depreciation, and any provision for impairment. 
Depreciation is calculated to write off all investment properties on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful economic lives. 
For buildings, the estimated useful economic life is assessed at 50 years. No depreciation is charged in respect of land.
Judgements and key sources of estimation
The preparation of accounts in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make 
judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of policies and reported amounts of assets and liabilities, income 
and expenses. The estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and various other factors that are 
believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis of making judgements about carrying values 
of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates.
The principal judgements made by the directors, in the application of these accounting policies that have significant effect on the 
financial statements and estimates with a significant risk of material adjustment in the next year are discussed below:
• IAS 36 ‘Impairment of assets’. In testing for impairment of investments and other assets, the directors have made certain 
assumptions concerning the future development of its subsidiary businesses that are consistent with their annual budgets and 
forecasts into perpetuity. Should these assumptions regarding the discount rate or growth in the profitability be unfounded then 
it is possible that investments included in the balance sheet could be impaired.
• IFRS 2 ‘Share-based payments’. The Company has issued equity settled share-based payments to certain employees in 
exchange for services rendered by them. The fair value is measured using an option valuation model at the date of grant and 
is recognised as an employee expense over the period in which the employees become unconditionally entitled to the options, 
with a corresponding increase in equity. This valuation is based on estimates of the number of options that will eventually 
vest, based on related service and non-market vesting conditions that are expected to be met, such that the amount ultimately 
recognised as an expense is based on the number of awards that do meet the related service and non-market performance 
conditions at the vesting date.
The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in 
the period in which the estimate is revised and in any of the future periods affected.

Investment property relates to a freehold property held by the Company for the purposes of obtaining rental income from a 
subsidiary undertaking. Rental income of £805,000 (2016: £805,000) was recorded in the income statement in the current period.
The fair value of the property at 25 March 2016 was determined by an external, independent expert with the appropriate 
professional qualifications and experience and was assessed at £9,700,000. This remains appropriate in the current year, given that 
there has been no indication that the assumptions used in the valuation have changed significantly.
Investment property includes land costing £800,000 (2016: £800,000) on which no depreciation is charged. Notes to the Company Financial Statements

The deferred tax liability in respect of the defined benefit pension plan surplus has been calculated using a rate of 35%, which 
represents the rate of tax that the trustees would be required to withhold on any refund of surplus assets.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised in full. Recognition of deferred tax assets is based on management’s assumptions that 
it is probable that the Company will have taxable profits against which the unused tax losses and deductible temporary timing 
differences can be utilised. Generally, in determining the amounts of deferred tax assets to be recognised, management uses 
profitability information and forecasted operating results based on approved business plans.
The aggregate value of deferred tax assets which have not been recognised is £6,414,000 (2016: £3,643,000). These amounts 
primarily relate to carried forward tax losses. No asset has been recognised in respect of these differences because there is 
insufficient evidence that the Company will make suitable future taxable profits against which these assets may be utilised.
Reductions in the UK corporation tax from 20% to 19% (effective from 1 April 2017) and to 18% (effective 1 April 2020) were 
substantively enacted on 26 October 2015, and an additional reduction to 17% (effective 1 April 2020) was substantively enacted 
on 6 September 2016. This will reduce the Company’s future current tax charge.

Capital reduction
In the prior year, at the Annual General Meeting of the Company held on 30 July 2015, a special resolution was passed approving 
the cancellation of all amounts standing to the credit of the Company’s share premium account and capital redemption reserve, 
along with the reduction of the nominal value of the ordinary share capital of the Company to 10p per ordinary share (“Capital 
Reduction”), subject to the approval of the Court. Court approval was obtained and following the subsequent registration of the 
Court order with the Registrar of Companies, the Capital Reduction became effective on 15 March 2016.
The impact of the capital reduction on equity is summarised as follows:

13 Financial commitments
The Company had no capital commitments at 31 March 2017 or 25 March 2016.
At the balance sheet date, the Company had total minimum lease payments under non-cancellable operating leases, which fall due 
as follows:
 Land and buildings Other assets
 2017 2016 2017 2016 
  £000 £000 £000 £000
Expiry date:
Within one year 4,594 4,576 12 144

After five years 31,794 32,986 — —
 50,114 50,058 12 144
The operating lease charge to the income statement in the current year was £12,185,000 (2016: £5,001,000), of which £7,484,000 
(2016: £nil) related to the onerous lease provision (see individually significant items – note 6 in the consolidated financial statements).
Leases of land and buildings are typically subject to rent reviews at specified intervals and provide for the lessee to pay all 
insurance, maintenance and repair costs.
14 Retirement benefits
Defined contribution pension scheme
The Company operates a defined contribution retirement benefit plan for all qualifying employees. The pension cost for the period 
represents contributions payable by the Company to the scheme and amounted to £279,000 (2016: £282,000).
Outstanding contributions amounting to £8,000 (2016: £37,000) were payable to the scheme and are included within other creditors.
Defined benefit pension schemes
Findel plc is the main sponsor of two sections of the Findel Group Pension Fund, a defined benefit pension plan, the Group section 
and the Galt section. The other two sections are the Education section and the Philip and Tacey section. The combined scheme 
is administered by Barnet Waddingham LLP. Only the costs and liabilities associated with the Group section and Galt section of 
the Findel Group Pension Fund scheme relate to Findel plc. There is no contractual agreement or stated policy for charging the 
net defined benefit cost of the Group and Galt sections and so Findel plc has recognised the entire net benefit cost of these two 
sections in its financial statements.
Group Section
The last funding valuation of the Scheme was undertaken at 5 April 2016 and recorded a deficit of £4,937,000 in respect of the 
Group section. The Company agreed to pay deficit reduction contributions of: £752,000 in the year to 31 March 2017, £615,000 p.a. 
between 31 March 2018 and 31 March 2019, £1,230,000 p.a. between 31 March 2020 and 31 March 2023 and £615,000 between 
1 April 2023 and 30 September 2023. The latest full actuarial valuation has been updated for IAS 19 purposes to 31 March 2017 
by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP (‘PwC’) using the assumptions detailed below.
Company contributions to the Group section for the upcoming financial year are expected to be around £752,000, in line with the 
current Schedule of Contributions.
Galt Section
The last funding valuation of the Scheme was undertaken at 5 April 2016 and recorded a deficit of £2,640,000 in respect of the 
Galt section. The Company agreed to pay deficit reduction contributions of: £265,000 in the year to 31 March 2017, £280,000 p.a. 
between 31 March 2018 and 31 March 2019, £560,000 p.a. between 31 March 2020 and 31 March 2023 and £280,000 between 
1 April 2023 and 30 September 2023. The latest full actuarial valuation has been updated for IAS 19 purposes to 31 March 2017 by 
PwC using the assumptions detailed below.
Company contributions to the Galt section for the upcoming financial year are expected to be around £265,000, in line with the 
current Schedule of Contributions.
The results of the IAS 19 valuation for both sections are summarised as follows:

Actuarial Assumptions – Group and Galt sections
The following are the principal actuarial assumptions at the reporting date:
 2017 2016
Financial Assumptions
Discount rate for scheme liabilities 2.60% 3.60%
RPI Price Inflation 3.30% 3.00%
CPI Price Inflation 2.30% 2.00%
Rate of increase to pensions in payment in line with RPI inflation (up to 5% per annum) 3.20% 3.00%
Rate of increase to pensions in payment in line with CPI inflation (up to 5% per annum) 2.30% 2.00%
Rate of increase to deferred pensions 2.30% 2.00%
Post retirement mortality (in years)
Current pensioners at 65 – male 87.4 yrs 87.2 yrs
Current pensioners at 65 – female 89.6 yrs 89.6 yrs
Future pensioners at 45 – male 89.2 yrs 88.9 yrs
Future pensioners at 45 – female 91.4 yrs 91.5 yrs
Demographic Assumptions
Cash Commutation (members taking cash lump sum) 80% 80%
Proportion of members that are married at retirement 75% 75%
Proportion of members taking TPIE option* 15% 15%
Age at which members are assumed to take TPIE option* 62.5 yrs 62.5 yrs
Assumptions regarding post retirement mortality are based on published statistics and mortality tables – S2NXA – CMI 2015 1.25% 
p.a. (2016: S1NXA – CMI 2015 1.25% p.a.)
*  The Scheme now has an embedded option at retirement for members to take TPIE (Total Pension Increase Exchange), following the bulk exercise carried out in 
late 2014 and early 2015. Since this option is now a formalised process, allowance has been made for this in calculating the IAS 19 liability. A 15% take up at an 
average age of 62.5 years has been assumed, based upon take up rates seen to date.
Sensitivities
The sensitivities regarding the principal assumptions used to measure the scheme liabilities are set out below:
Group section
  Impact on scheme liabilities
Assumption Change in assumption If assumption increases If assumption decreases
Discount rate 0.5% Decrease by 8.3% Increase by 9.4%
RPI Inflation 0.5% Increase by 4.0% Decrease by 3.5%
CPI Inflation 0.5% Increase by 1.2% Decrease by 0.9%
Longevity 1 year Increase by 4.25% Decrease by 4.6%
Group section
  Impact on scheme liabilities
Assumption Change in assumption If assumption increases If assumption decreases
Discount rate 0.5% Decrease by 8.3% Increase by 9.4%
RPI Inflation 0.5% Increase by 4.4% Decrease by 4.0%
CPI Inflation 0.5% Increase by 2.1% Decrease by 2.0%
Longevity 1 year Increase by 4.0% Decrease by 4.1%
The above sensitivities are approximate and show the likely increase to each section’s liabilities under IAS19 if an assumption is 
adjusted whilst all other assumptions remain the same. The sensitivities are for illustration purposes only and do not necessarily 
represent the directors’ view of the expected changes to the assumptions in the future. Notes to the Company Financial Statements

Risks
Investment risk
Allowance is made in the assumptions for the expected long-term performance of asset classes such as equities. There is a 
risk that these returns will not be achieved in practice, which would result in an increase in the Scheme’s liabilities and further 
contributions being required. Further, the value of the Scheme’s assets may not move in line with the Scheme’s liabilities – either 
because the Scheme invests in volatile assets whose value might fall, or because the value of the liabilities has increased due to 
falling interest rates and the assets are not of sufficient duration to keep up (or a combination of these).
Inflation
In projecting the expected future benefit payments, assumptions are made regarding future price inflation. There is a risk that the 
actual rate of inflation will be higher than assumed which will increase the cost of providing the benefits and thus the liability. This 
would result in additional contributions being required and a deterioration in the solvency position unless investment returns are 
similarly higher than expected.
Mortality
It is not possible to predict with any certainty how long members of the Scheme will live, and if members live longer than expected, 
additional contributions will be required and the Scheme’s solvency position will deteriorate.
Managing risk
To manage the risk of the Scheme, a TPIE exercise was carried out during 2015, which resulted in a number of members 
transferring out of the Scheme. The TPIE option has now been embedded within the scheme.
IFRIC 14
IFRIC 14 is an interpretation relating to IAS 19 that covers whether pension scheme surpluses can be recognised on the balance 
sheet. Based on the circumstances of the Fund and in line with the prior period, management do not believe that IFRIC 14 impacts 
the IAS 19 results since the Company has a right to a refund of surplus assets at some point in the future, and as such have not 
made any adjustments to the results.
The following table shows the expected future payments for the Group and Galt sections of the Findel Group Pension Fund:
