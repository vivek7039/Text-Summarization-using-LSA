RETAIL INNOVATION
T o deliver standardisation and simplification for product 
and POSVM display, the Communisis’ team needed to come 
up with a faster, more cost effective and bespoke method for 
deploying campaigns into stores. The solution was an online 
“store” of retail POS materials, allowing managers to log in 
and order displays tailored to their requirements.

services to the BBC for TV Licensing was renewed for a six year term. 
• HMRC (Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs): good progress in 
the implementation of the contract for all outbound printed 
customer communication and forms fulfilment. Following 
successful migration of all fulfilment activity to our Newcastle

COMMUNISIS AT A GLANCE
VALUE FOR CLIENTS
Across the markets in which we operate, common 
themes which enable clients to maximise the benefits 
of the products, services and insight we provide have 
enabled us to define our strategic priorities and the 
optimal divisional structure to deliver them.
Our clients need innovation in their supply chain, 
enabling them to future proof, focus on their core 
activities and grow return on investment and market 
share. They need simplicity in their supply chain, 
reducing the number of key suppliers to a smaller 
number of proactive, strategic partners. Resilience of 
service and regulatory compliance are critical.
Understanding these needs, Communisis delivers 
security, accuracy, integrity and reliability with the cost 
competitive scale of our pan-European network and UK 
operations. We provide multi-channel delivery and digital 
leadership to our clients as well as our unique expertise.
This allows our clients to increase sales at a premium 
and improve speed to market, being lean, standardised 
and simplified. We help them stay safe, manage risk, 
keeping them informed and able to make better 
decisions. This all builds loyalty and trust.

HOW THIS WORKED FOR A 
GLOBAL FMCG BRAND
Before Communisis, a client had a minimum 
of 23 touchpoints necessary to successfully 
deliver a project. By driving standardisation, 
providing consistency, control and visibility 
whilst maximising savings opportunities, we 
were able to reduce these touchpoints to 
seven whilst also enabling the client to realise 
the following further benefits:
• increased speed to markets for campaigns;
• encouraging innovation and 
value-added benefits;
• reduced cost to serve through a more 
consolidated delivery of the services;
• access to innovation and capability from 
the supply chain; and 
• greater savings as a result of larger 
spend leverage.

Ensuring customers continue to buy from the 
same brand again and again remains a critical 
component of success for any consumer-
focused business. For this client, we developed a 
loyalty magazine that contained personalised 
coupons to encourage new purchases. This 
incentivised customers to stay loyal to the 
brand, while also giving the company a highly 
useful buying habit measuring tool.

LAUNCH OF STRATEGY FOR 
NEXT PHASE OF GROWTH
I joined the Communisis Board last March and was appointed 
to the chair at the Annual General Meeting (AGM) in May. 
These preliminary results are therefore my first as Chairman 
of your Company. 
The past twelve months have confirmed my initial views about the 
strength of the business. A track record of growth backed by strong cash 
generation has been established over several years. We perform mission 
critical work at scale for very substantial clients across the Financial 
Services and Fast-Moving Consumer Goods (FMCG) sectors. We are 
significantly invested in our people, systems and infrastructure to fulfil 
data-sensitive, regulation-mandated customer communications, at 
high volumes and to manage complex, time-critical multinational 
product programmes for some of the world’s biggest brands. We are 
differentiated from our competitor/comparator set in many ways. Our 
long-term client retention levels are sector-leading.
The foundation for further success is therefore in place. To build 
upon it we have now set ourselves one key priority which is to raise 
the underlying profitability of the business in a sustainable way.
The Value Enhancement Programme (VEP) which we are launching, 
is a three-year plan to deliver enhanced returns to our shareholders 
by raising the demonstrable value we deliver to our clients.
Under the VEP we will launch a series of digital and data-led client 
initiatives which will include providing complete format and channel 
flexibility for client communications; building out added value 
services in allied areas such as fraud protection and data security 
and developing data analytics driven insight programmes to give 
clients greater visibility of enhancement opportunities. We also 
continue our commitment to embrace process innovation to deliver 
cost efficiency without compromising effectiveness of output. 
The core aim of the VEP will be to evidence consistently that our 
clients will drive higher returns on their investment with us than they 
can either with alternative providers or by retaining in house the 
activity in which we specialise. Communisis will not be the lowest 
price option - we are not a commodity level provider - but we will 
partner with our clients to deliver the highest returns on their spend.
The VEP is our practical response to three key strategic themes of our 
business: Digital First, Global Reach and Empowered Organisation.
• Digital First recognises that an increasing proportion of the 
customers of our clients now prefer to communicate online. This 
now established trend will have a notable effect on our transactional 
business over time. It is our intention to take a still more pro-active 
lead with Digital and put it at the forefront of our transactional 
business. We will do that by accelerating existing organic 
developments, working with a range of technology partners and 
where appropriate acquiring the necessary skills and experience to 
strengthen our core propositions. We believe the time is ripe to enrich 
customer dialogue through the meaningful application of Digital - it 
is about a lot more than saving postage costs. 
FULL YEAR DIVIDEND PER SHARE
2.66p
(2016 2.42p)
Communisis delivered a strong set 
of results in 2017 . It was especially 
pleasing to see further growth in 
adjusted diluted EPS, solid free cash 
flow and a significant reduction in 
net debt.
The final dividend for the year is 
proposed at 1.77p which added to 
the interim dividend of 0.89p gives a 
total of 2.66p, a 10% increase on the 
previous year.
CHAIRMAN’S STATEMENT Strategic Report
09 Communisis plc  Annual Report and Financial Statements 2017
CASE STUDY
FMCG BRAND
COUNTERING RETAIL OVERLOAD
Introducing customers to a wider range 
of products was a challenge that 
produced excellent results. Before they 
came to us, over 75% of the coffee brand’s 
sales came from just two products, 
making the need for more emphasis on 
their wider portfolio stronger than ever. 
Our team devised a new campaign that 
involved segmenting each brand into a 
range of different coffee-drinking 
occasions. This has helped to transform 
this brand and remains hugely popular 
and successful among consumers today. 
NEW SPLIT OF SALES 
Digital transformation will have other positive impacts on 
Communisis. For example it will allow us to extend the application of 
data analytics as a service and capture opportunities for the 
digitisation of our services for marketing execution.
• Global Reach is the recognition that many of our clients are truly 
international businesses and expect our services to be available in 
an increasing number of territories. We already have 30% of our 
sales in overseas markets and a prudent approach in EMEA has 
seen our network expand through our main hubs in Paris, Madrid, 
Rome, Warsaw and Frankfurt and eastward as far as Istanbul 
and Dubai. We have announced that we will be opening an office 
in Hong Kong for the sourcing of “premiums”; the gifts which 
accompany many purchases of luxury goods. This move will make 
us more responsive in this growth area and contribute to increased 
margins by taking more direct control of these supply chains. 
Heartened by the good progress Editions has made in New Y ork 
in 2017 with financial services clients, we aim to significantly 
enhance our presence in the USA. The three main opportunity 
areas we have identified are: further growth for Editions in content 
marketing, mostly in financial services; scope to access marketing 
execution services under our existing master relationships with 
brand owners; and digital transactional communications.
• Empowered Organisation covers a range of initiatives designed 
to make Communisis progressively more efficient and valuable. 
From a client perspective it is about our becoming still more 
integrated into client workflows to give them greater visibility and 
understanding of the impact of their communication and marketing 
execution choices and surfacing opportunities to enhance their 
efficiency or effectiveness or both. From a Communisis commercial 
perspective, this involves driving fresh marketing and commercial 
initiatives to deliver the right pipeline of growth opportunities. 
Communisis will selectively target the business it is best equipped to 
deliver and where it can retain more of the value which it creates for 
its clients. The structure of contracts will adapt accordingly. From an 
organisational perspective we are fuelling this by devolving more 
direct P&L responsibility into the hands of our local site and country 
managers, empowering them to drive the profitability of their 
discrete business units entrepreneurially. 
Communisis remains committed to delivering enhanced returns to its 
shareholders.  The announcement of our three-year VEP is a new 
expression of that commitment. Alongside investing capital in pursuit 
of that growth, we will continue to ensure that a strong dividend 
remains a key component of our total shareholder returns policy.
BOARD COMPOSITION
Having reviewed the Board structure to enact these future plans, 
we announced in December 2017 that Steve Rawlins was joining us

STRONG TRADING 
IN 2017
MARKET TRENDS 
The UK financial services industry remains the primary market 
for our Customer Experience division. Our clients and prospects 
within this market continue to see lower headline growth due to 
saturation and are therefore primarily focused on retention of 
market share and enriching their customer relationships. The 
continued migration to digital channels, improving customer 
experience and emphasis on quality of customer 
communications are central to this and our solutions and 
services are well placed to fulfil client needs.
Within the insurance market, organisations are more focused on 
gaining market share over retention and are proactively acquiring 
the capability to shift to channels of customer preference. Digital 
channels are therefore preferred and communications are 
typically complex and highly personalised. The utilities sector 
again is typified by lower headline growth but customer habits are 
changing and moving more digital to take personal control of 
consumption and respond to environmental concerns.
Demand for specialist content marketing capability, such as that 
provided by our Editions Financial business, is strong in the UK 
and US. Experience during 2017 suggests that high quality content 
delivered by genuine sector specialists is being favoured by chief 
marketing officers to enable brands to speak with authority.
Within the international FMCG market, the challenge for most 
brand owners in 2017 was the fluctuation of currency and how 
this has affected the repatriation of Euros or Pounds to Dollars 
(typically). This has caused some pressure on marketing budgets. 
In-store marketers are responding to the trend to cheaper, own 
brand alternatives and online shopping. There has been a drive 
towards standardisation to increase production leverage and 
efficiency and a desire for displays to be more permanent. There 
is still a focus on supply chain efficiencies and eliminating waste/
failed delivery with some market estimates at up to 20% of 
pre-filled free-standing display units not making it to their 
intended shop floor destination. Such challenges represent 
opportunity for our Brand Deployment division.
CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S STATEMENT
12 Communisis plc  Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Strategic Report
13 Communisis plc  Annual Report and Financial Statements 2017
With the increased sales in the craft drinks sector (whether 
that be beers, gins, etc.), major brand businesses have needed 
to respond to keep on-shelf presence in supermarkets. Brands 
are therefore offering more events or Gift with Purchase (GWP) 
to keep their in-store presence and increase sales. As a result, 
we have seen a marked increase in the requirement for fast 
turnaround co-packing of GWP for major shopping events 
(Christmas, Father’s Day and other anniversaries). We expect 
to see this trend increase in 2018.
The broader agency market dynamic is changing significantly 
at present, driven largely by the entrance of consultancy-based 
businesses into the sector. This has increased commoditisation 
of service and has led to a reduction of fees. That said, with the 
increased pushback on the lack of transparency online, agencies 
are being asked to deliver more demonstrable sales and can 
charge for that effectiveness. In addition, there are increased 
calls to design products for in-store that can be used efficiently 
as well as effectively to reduce costs and increase sales. There 
remain strong opportunities in brand awareness and product 
launches and this is where, for example, our agency Twelve 
has been successful.
We still anticipate further consolidation within our sectors. As we

our competitor set has shifted somewhat. This now includes 
technology-based competitors, as well as consultancy businesses.
We continue to monitor the impact of Brexit negotiations on the 
economies in which we operate. There are not yet any clear 
political outcomes but given our activity in the wider supply 
chain for staple consumer goods and employment of foreign 
nationals, in-country, we continue to believe that we are 
relatively well protected from potential negative economic 
impacts Brexit may have.
RISK/GDPR/REGULATION
The Group has a formal approach to risk management. In 
considering the risk to the business over the past 18 months, the 
Group has reviewed and refined its approach to data protection 
in line with the changing global landscape and new legislation. 
The EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is of 
particular focus and is a regulation which updates rights and 
provides opportunities for individuals and companies in the 21st 
century. The primary objective of the GDPR is to give back control 
of personal data and to simplify the regulatory environment for 
international business. When it is implemented in May 2018, in the 
words of the Information Commissioner, GDPR will be ‘a game 
changer for us all’ by:
• putting the spotlight on accountability;
• emphasising transparency;
• extending the scope of data protection;
• introducing fines for non-compliance; and
• realising the business benefits of this changing environment.

Communisis’ activities as both a Data Controller and a Data 
Processor have required us to review our operations against the 
new regulations and put in place actions to address the risk of 
non-compliance. As part of our ongoing investment that 
supports the business, we have integrated Data Protection within 
the Group as part of our Information Security Management 
System. This investment, comprising £0.8m capital and £0.8m 
operational expenditure in 2018, includes:
• dedicated Data Protection Compliance Officers, who are 
experienced subject matter experts, bringing in skills and 
experience from both the public and private sectors;
• developing ‘Records of Processing Activities’ models which are 
used to assess the processing Communisis undertakes as both 
a Data Controller and Data Processor and feed into an 
updated risk assessment procedure and Data Processing

liabilities, to assist clients in their compliance.
DETAILED TRADING REVIEW PER DIVISION FOR 2017  
CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE
2017 was a positive year for Customer Experience with a strong 
overall increase in profitability. The Direct Mail business 
performed well, showing significant improvement on prior year 
numbers. This was largely driven by increased insourcing of work 
and stringent cost control. The overall transactional business 
(outbound and inbound) improved profitability against prior 
year, driven by new contracts and increased volumes. Our 
technology business also outperformed 2016. This was related to 
transition activity on-boarding a new client to our Connect
TM
 
digital platform for customer communications management. 
The Security Print business (predominantly cheque book 
production) was down on volume but demand for our new 
digital technology for fraud prevention has increased with a 
number of bank clients now using our system for eUCN, a 
patented cheque fraud feature exclusive to Communisis. 
We refocused our general creative agency Psona onto 
Communisis’ core client bases in Financial Services and FMCG 
and restructured to integrate its ongoing and future client activity.
BRAND DEPLOYMENT
This division achieved proportionately less profit growth than revenue 
growth, mainly in our core Managed Services business, driven by 
country mix and investment in new markets. The Campaign Fulfilment 
business outperformed expectations as it brought various new 
contracts on-board and we expanded our services in the drinks 
sector. The Agencies finished ahead of prior year, mainly due to 
projects relating to the telecommunications sector within T welve.
TECHNOLOGY
The continued importance of technology, in the delivery of 
services to our clients and supporting our operating model, 
provided focus to improve capability, control and visibility of 
services and systems in 2017. To enable this, we made a number 
of significant industry hires in the year. We implemented a best 
practice approach to enterprise architecture enabling us to align 
people, process and technology with specific expertise from the 
financial services sector. Amongst other benefits, this approach 
allowed us to develop a scalable, multi-tenanted product for 
digital asset management and workflow during 2017 which now 
supports five clients, with capacity and capability for further 
on-boarding. This allows marketing teams access to creative 
content for action and approval.

Formal service reviews with stakeholders are now embedded, 
creating dialogue which enables transformation plans aligned to 
business need and strategic priorities. This is supported by an 
internal customer satisfaction survey, providing quantitative 
understanding of the service we deliver and assisting us to 
shape our future planning. Through systematic selection and 
contracting with 3rd party vendors (the latter being increasingly 
pertinent as we continue to develop real time digital products), 
we have improved services received from our technology supply 
base, in addition to generating important savings in the year.
We have also prioritised investment in technology solutions 
and services. This includes major software expenditure over 
two years with ‘Noosh’, a product which allows Communisis 
to support marketing services and print procurement in a more 
operationally efficient and expedient way, a significant step in 
the digitisation of our business processes in Brand Deployment. 
We also adopted ‘Solarwinds’ in the year for service and incident 
management and products for internal and external collaboration. 
This extends to federation with clients to improve lines of 
communication and manage costs more effectively.

RISK MANAGEMENT AND PRINCIPAL RISKS
OUR APPROACH
The Board is accountable for ensuring the identification and 
appropriate management of potential risks faced by the Group. 
The internal audit function’s responsibilities include overseeing 
the effectiveness of the internal control environment of the Group 
and its ongoing risk management programme. This process is 
designed to identify, evaluate and manage the principal risks 
faced by the business in line with the Group Risk Policy Statement. 
Risk management is the extent to which the Group responds to 
the opportunities faced, whilst at the same time understanding 
and seeking to control any threats that could prevent its 
achievement of business objectives and successful execution of 
our business strategy. 
The aim of the Group’s risk management programme is therefore 
to improve the awareness of the consequences of risk-taking 
activities, reduce the frequency of damaging events occurring 
and minimise the severity of the consequences if they do occur. 
Part of this approach includes operation in line with or 
certification to a number of standards. This helps the business to 
work to legal, regulatory and contractual requirements using a 
set of clearly defined frameworks and management systems.
Policy requires that business unit heads demonstrate that they 
conform to the requirements of the Communisis Group risk 
management programme. Assessments must be undertaken, 
risks identified, controls identified and action managed for all 
activities that are identified as being critical to Communisis. 
During the year, all business units are required to report their 
material risks on a monthly basis to the internal audit function 
enabling independent review and reporting to the Board and 
senior management teams. Impact assessments are carried out 
to ascertain the likelihood of occurrence of each risk and the 
potential impact on the Group.
In addition, the Board also carries out a regular top down risk 
assessment of the most significant strategic risks that are linked 
to the achievement of the Group’s strategic initiatives. 
VIABILITY STATEMENT
The Group has prepared five-year forecasts of profitability and cash 
flow as part of the goodwill impairment testing and, with average 
contract lives of five years, the Group has good medium-term 
visibility of the business. Despite this, there will always be uncertain 
factors outside the control of Communisis and forecasting can never 
take into account unknown future economic, legal or regulatory 
changes which could impact the business and the markets in which 
it operates. In recognition of this, and consistent with the Value 
Enhancement Programme, the Group has produced a viability 
assessment based on the three-year period to December 2020, and 
can confirm that they have a reasonable expectation that the Group 
will continue to operate and meet its liabilities as they fall due for the 
next three years.
In making this statement the Directors have considered forecasts for 
the next three years, which include the Group’s key financial ratios 
and cash flows over the period, and formed an opinion over the 
resilience of the Group. This takes into account the current position, 
the principal risks facing the business in severe but plausible 
scenarios and the effectiveness of any mitigating actions. This 
assessment has considered the potential impacts of these risks on 
the business model, future performance, solvency and liquidity over 
the three-year period. The Directors consider the period to 
December 2020 to be appropriate as this is in line with the period 
covered by the Group’s financial and strategic planning. Clients have 
shown an increased willingness to enter into longer contractual 
terms resulting in improved visibility for the Group from a financial 
perspective. With more emphasis being placed internally on 
identifying and managing pervasive risk, the Directors are confident 
that the Group will operate in line with the three-year forecasts.
Whilst the review has considered all the principal risks identified in 
the table below, three have been identified for enhanced stress 
testing where they are considered to have the most significant 
plausibility and impact. These are: safeguarding of data and cyber 
risk; response to technological change; and the loss of major clients. 
T esting in isolation was considered inappropriate, as ultimately the 
occurrence of a severe data incident or adverse impact from 
technological change could lead to loss of major clients (either 
through reputational damage or failure to respond to the client’s 
progressive adoption of digital communication channels). From May 
2018 the impact of a data incident may also result in fines from the 
Information Commissioner’s Office, due to General Data Protection 
Regulation (GDPR). The three-year forecasts have therefore been 
stress tested by considering these data and technological risks and 
then overlaying the impact of the loss of the Group’s top three 
customers.
During 2017 the Group’s banking facilities were renewed and are in 
place until August 2022. Availability of bank facilities is not expected 
to present any risk to the viability of the Group and has not therefore 
featured within the viability stress testing.
Whilst the occurrence of these risks is plausible, the Group are 
confident that the mitigating actions detailed in the table overleaf 
are sufficient to minimise the impact.
GOING CONCERN
The Directors, after making enquiries, have a reasonable 
expectation that the Group has adequate resources to continue 
in operational existence for the foreseeable future, a period not 
less than 12 months from the date of the Financial Statements. 
For this reason, they have adopted the going concern basis in 
preparing the Financial Statements.
MANAGING RISK TO DELIVER 
STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES
T o successfully deliver against the Group’s strategic initiatives, we must first 
understand the risks faced and plan to manage them to an acceptable level. Strategic Report
19 Communisis plc  Annual Report and Financial Statements 2017
RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES
The principal risks and uncertainties facing the business are taken directly from the risk registers and are 
detailed below. The Group faces other risks which are subject to regular review and have been assessed as 
lower risk and are therefore not included here. Some risk factors remain beyond the direct control of the Group 
and the risk management programme. We can therefore, only provide reasonable but not absolute assurance 
that key risks are managed to an acceptable level. The Group continues to monitor the impact of the UK’s 
decision to exit the EU but until we have more visibility of the eventual outcome it is difficult to fully evaluate the 
impact on the Group’s activities.

The Group must be 
able to respond to 
market and

Clients’ and their customers’ progressive adoption 
of digital formats and channels may impact Group 
strategy and market demand for products and 
services.
The impact is that the systems and equipment 
utilised by the Group could potentially be

management.
A disruptive technological change has not been 
anticipated as a result of a lack of investment in 
new products and services.
We may not adequately identify and protect our IP.

Deterioration in the 
economic environment 
may decrease 
profitability
The impact is that macro-economic issues 
may quickly and detrimentally affect consumer 
expenditure, which could impact the trading 
performance of the Group’s clients and reduce 
their discretionary spend resulting in lower sales 
and profitability.
Market trends are monitored and factored into the

The Group’s last acquisition was in January 2015 
which is now integrated fully within the Group with 
appropriate cost base control. The ongoing risk is 
that in the longer term the acquisitions may not 
achieve the revenues anticipated within the 
business case on acquisition.
The Group has a clear strategy for ensuring growth. 
This includes assessment of the alignment of the

Clients rely upon 
proven resilient 
business operations 
Certain Group operations depend upon the 
uninterrupted delivery of products and services 
that rely on complex computer networks and 
systems. 
The impact is that the Group may face a 
significant business continuity incident that 
will materially affect its ability to deliver 
products or services to its clients, and 
associated financial penalties.
A Business Continuity Management (BCM) system 
and BCM plans are in place. These are exercised

People, talent and

Without learning, development resource and 
succession planning, there is a risk that the 
Group will be unable to develop, retain and 
motivate highly skilled employees that are 
necessary to support operations, expand 
and build client relationships. 
There is also a possible impact to employee 
morale and wellbeing from a failure by the 
Group to maintain a safe and compliant 
working environment.
The Group actively monitors senior leadership to 
ensure motivation is maintained, that succession 
plans are in place and applied to relevant 
team members. 
A growing range of benefits and incentives are 
provided by the Group to its staff. 
The Group has policies and procedures in place

CHANGE IN 
LEVEL OF RISK
Existing client 
concentration may 
mean that the loss 
of a major client 
could materially 
decrease sales 
A substantial percentage of the Group’s revenues 
are derived from a relatively small number of 
clients and therefore the loss of one or more of 
these clients could have a material impact on the 
Group’s sales. This could result in a material 
decrease in profitability whilst new contracts are 
sought and excess capacity reduced.
In the year ended 31 December 2017 the top five 
clients of the Group accounted for approximately 
48% of sales (2016 56%).
A strategic account management programme 
operates to preserve client relationships, monitor 
compliance with service level agreements and 
expand the services offered to key clients. 
Business development activities continue to promote 
the Group’s services in a broad range of market 
sectors and into international markets, reducing the 
historical reliance on the financial services sector. 
Long-term client relationships and associated 
contractual commitments are developed. 
The level of 
risk is stable
Due to high 
operational gearing, 
a reduction in 
revenues could 
significantly impact 
profitability 
The impacts are that the Group will not:
• adapt sufficiently quickly to any technological 
change or downturn in demand, with a 
consequent loss of competitiveness and 
profitability; 
• have adequate resources to invest in new 
technology and services; 
• retain its major client portfolio, without 
replacement, or recover debts; and 
• diversify sufficiently into other market sectors. 
The Group prepares regular financial forecasts 
to evaluate its funding and liquidity requirements 
for the foreseeable future. These forecasts are 
reviewed and approved by the Board. Based on 
these forecasts, appropriate funding and liquidity 
solutions are put in place to ensure that 
appropriate headroom is maintained.  
A range of financing facilities are utilised with a 
reasonable degree of headroom over projected 
funding requirements. The Group’s lending 
arrangements have been renewed and are in 
place until August 2022. 
Client credit is closely monitored and controlled 
to minimise the amount of overdue debt. Credit 
insurance is obtained against larger non-financial 
services sector debts. 
Working capital and capital expenditure are 
actively managed to ensure that banking 
covenants are not breached. 
The level 
of risk is

A change in pension 
scheme assumptions 
could increase the 
pension deficit 
Communisis has continuing obligations under a 
defined benefit pension scheme that is now closed 
to new entrants. The IAS 19 accounting pension 
deficit is £38.2m as at 31 December 2017. 
The impact is that any changes in assumptions, 
such as interest rates, equity returns or discount 
rates could require substantial future cash 
contributions to eliminate any resulting increase in 
the pension scheme deficit and therefore decrease 
the Group’s ability to expand the business through 
continued investment or to pay dividends 
to shareholders. 
The Group works closely with the pension scheme 
trustees to adopt programmes that optimise 
returns on pension scheme assets, reduce the 
ultimate pension liabilities and minimise the level 
of additional cash contributions required to 
eliminate any deficit. 
The triennial valuation was completed in 2017 with 
a funding deficit of £29.8m. Following this, deficit 
repair payments have been set at a base of 
£2.55m in addition to the £1.15m annual payments 
under the Central Asset Reserve scheme. The next 
triennial valuation will be in 2020.

Potential lease 
liabilities from past 
disposals could result 
in high cash costs to 
the Group 
The Group has contingent liabilities arising from 
lease commitment guarantees on past corporate 
disposals. 
The principal impact is that current leasehold 
occupants will become insolvent and that 
guarantees will be called, resulting in a material 
cash cost to the Group.
The financial status of the leasehold occupants is 
monitored on a regular basis. 
Action will be taken to minimise the cost to the 
Group when default is anticipated.

FINANCIAL REVIEW
CONTINUED GROWTH
SUMMARY
• The Group continues to grow 
in both revenues and profit 
generation across both divisions, 
resulting in an adjusted operating 
profit of £21.2m (2016 £19.5m) and 
adjusted diluted earnings per 
share of 6.37p (2016 6.07p).
• Strong conversion of profits to 
cash generated a free cash flow 
of £12.5m (2016 £12.9m), leading 
to further net debt reduction by 
£6.1m to £24.3m (2016 £30.4m).
• The Group’s adjusted operating 
margin increased to 5.6% 
(2016 5.4%).
TRADING SUMMARY
2017 was a further year of growth in revenues and profits within 
both divisions with strong free cash generation and continued 
reduction in net debt.
Total revenue grew by 4% to £375.9m (2016 £361.9m), driven by 
expansion of international operations with overseas revenues 
now representing 30% of Group revenue (2016 26%). Adjusted 
operating profits rose 9% to £21.2m (2016 £19.5m) from growth 
across both divisions. Customer Experience grew from the 
integration of new business wins and strong performance across 
both traditional revenue streams and newer digital outputs. 
Brand Deployment saw further development within its overseas 
network and an increased level of Campaign Fulfilment activity. 
Together, this delivered adjusted profit before tax of £17.2m (2016 
£16.7m) and adjusted diluted earnings per share of 6.37p, up 
from 6.07p in 2016, an increase of 5%.
Free cash flow of £12.5m (2016 £12.9m) remained strong, despite 
increased tax payments and higher pension deficit repair payments, 
as a result of higher underlying earnings and lower capital 
expenditure. Net debt as a result reduced by £6.1m to £24.3m.
The segmental reporting is aligned with the Group’s strategic 
direction and the way in which activities are managed. Revenue 
and operating profit before exceptional items are reported in 
two divisions: Customer Experience and Brand Deployment. 
Central costs that support the full Group are reported separately. 
CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE
Gross revenue for the division was £189.3m, increased from 
£185.0m in 2016. This was due to the integration of new business 
wins and a strong year across both digital revenue streams and 
the traditional areas of direct mail and statements where volume 
erosion across transactional print channels continues but at 
lower levels than expected. 
Adjusted operating profit for Customer Experience at £22.4m was 
£2.5m higher than 2016 with very strong performances across the 
business. Significant improvements were seen in Direct Mail as a 
result of insourcing and strong cost control within the production 
environment, in Inbound due to increased volumes, and in our 
transactional business due to new business wins and the 
associated transition income relating to the integration into

eUCN, boding well for 2018. Editions Financial had another strong 
year and successfully established the New York office as planned, 
initially providing content marketing to our client, LinkedIn, and 
on-boarding further large financial services clients. The Agencies 
performed at similar levels to 2016 but underwent a significant 
restructuring during the year with the closure of the Glasgow 
operation and full restructure of the London based teams, entering 
2018 leaner and more focused on core services and clients.
BRAND DEPLOYMENT
Gross revenue grew to £186.6m from £176.9m during the year, 
with Managed Services benefitting from strong sales growth 
across Germany, Poland, France, Spain, Italy and Dubai, which 
saw its first full year of operations.
Adjusted operating profit showed some growth to £16.5m (2016 
£16.2m). In Managed Services the margin did not increase 
proportionately in line with revenue as a result of country mix 
together with investment in new countries as we build out the 
international operations. The focus going forwards is on 
operating margin improvement through both operational 
efficiencies and continued investment in systems along with 
integration of new client wins. Campaign Fulfilment, performed 
by our Newcastle based operation, had a very successful year 
with growth in revenues and profits from a number of new 
contracts. The agencies Life and Twelve together had a strong 
year, with further growth and their most profitable year to date 
since acquisition.
CENTRAL AND CORPORATE COSTS
Central costs are £0.8m higher than in 2016, driven by increased 
spend on technology and increased focus on marketing and 
development of the Communisis brand. In addition, pension 
costs in 2017 included within Corporate Costs did not benefit 
from £0.4m of one-off settlement gains experienced in 2016.

FINANCIAL REVIEW CONTINUED 
EXCEPTIONAL ITEMS
Total exceptional costs charged in the year were £2.1m, 
including £1.7m associated with restructuring across the agency 
and Managed Service businesses, restructuring of the Group 
marketing function and closure of the Bangalore and Glasgow 
offices. In addition there was a £0.2m non-cash write off relating 
to customer relationship assets, offset by a £0.3m fair value 
revaluation release of contingent consideration in respect of 
recent acquisitions. The Group also incurred a £0.5m write off 
in respect of unsupported assets which will not be recovered.
NET FINANCE COSTS
Finance costs were £1.2m higher than the prior year due to a 
swing on the impact of foreign currency translation of non-
trading balances. 2016 had benefitted from a £0.9m gain 
whereas there was a £0.4m loss in 2017. Both pension and bank 
finance charges were at a consistent level in both years.
TAXATION
The effective tax rate in the Income Statement was 18.4% 
(2016 25.6%). 
During the year, the effective tax rate has benefitted from a 
number of credits which related to prior years. The balance has 
been adjusted through the current year Income Statement, as 
management consider that the adjustment is immaterial in the 
context of an understanding of the Group’s financial 
performance for users of the financial statements.
Excluding this adjustment the tax rate would have been 22.7% 
which is higher than the UK rate of corporation tax due to the 
proportion of profits generated in overseas jurisdictions with 
higher tax rates.

Generating strong free cash flow and continued debt reduction 
remains a priority for the Group and during 2017, we are pleased 
to report a further 20% reduction in net debt of £6.1m to £24.3m.
Free cash flow remained strong at £12.5m (2016 £12.9m) with 
increased pension deficit repair payments, higher tax payments 
and increased working capital being offset by higher underlying 
profitability, lower capital expenditure and lower exceptional items. 
Dividends paid to shareholders increased by £0.4m to £5.2m.
Promissory loan notes of £9.3m in respect of the Life Marketing 
Consultancy acquisition in January 2015 were repaid during 
January 2017 from normal facilities. The overall movement in 
bank debt including this was a net cash outflow of £3.1m. 
Excluding this repayment the cash improvement during the year 
was £6.2m.
The net bank debt at the end of the year was £22.8m (2016 £19.7m), 
with significant headroom within the Group’s facilities of £70m. 
Average net bank debt during the year was £41.9m (2016 £32.7m), 
at a higher level than 2016 following the repayment of the 
promissory loan notes.  
During the year the banking facilities were renewed through to 
August 2022. As part of the facility, Communisis has to comply 
with a number of covenants, including maintaining a multiple of 
net bank debt to EBITDA and EBITA to net finance costs, both of 
which were in compliance with significant headroom. 
DIVIDENDS
The Board has proposed a final dividend of 1.77p per share 
bringing the total dividend for the year to 2.66p per share, an 
increase of 10% over 2016.
PENSIONS
The pension scheme accounting deficit at the year end 
decreased to £38.2m (2016 £55.5m). This reflects both an 
improvement in asset valuations and a reduction in liabilities. 
The reduction in liabilities incorporates changes in mortality 
assumptions following the 31 March 2017 triennial valuation. 
Discount rates in 2017 reduced to 2.5% from 2.7% with RPI/CPI 
rates remaining static.  
Cash contributions to the pension scheme are determined by 
reference to the triennial actuarial valuation. During the year the 
31 March 2017 triennial valuation was completed with deficit 
repair payments being set for future years. The contributions 
paid in 2017 towards the accounting deficit were £2.9m plus 
rental payments of £1.1m through the Central Asset Reserve 
arrangement. The next triennial valuation will be in 2020.
BALANCE SHEET AND NET ASSETS
Net assets as at 31 December 2017 have increased by £20.9m 
since the prior year. This increase does however include the 
benefit of a £17.3m reduction in the pension scheme deficit. 
Excluding this, Group net assets increased by £3.6m during 
the year.
CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY
The Group embraces corporate social responsibility and our 
policies make Communisis more resilient, more productive and 
more predictable in performance, whilst delivering economic 
and environmental benefits to society as a whole.

CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY REPORT
SUSTAINABLE ACTIVITIES
Communisis has continued to elevate the level of corporate social 
responsibility (CSR) internally by constantly reviewing and improving 
processes to track sustainable activities that the business has been 
involved in. We ensure that we support charitable organisations and 
continue to safeguard the future of our business through our focus on 
apprenticeships, internships and learning and development.
OUR PEOPLE AND ORGANISATION
We recruit, develop and retain top quality people who help us 
to grow the business and achieve our strategic aims.
Details of how the Company attracts, develops and retains the 
best people and engages, develops and rewards its people, 
are set out below.
ATTRACT, DEVELOP AND RETAIN THE BEST PEOPLE
We communicate our strategic goals to all of our managers and 
empower them to develop both themselves and those for whom 
they are responsible through focused training to ensure they can 
best deliver those goals.
In 2017 we grew our internal learning and development team. 
This team delivers a range of technical, leadership and 
developmental training to all our people, running a number of 
tailored leadership training programmes throughout the year. 
Some 120 of our most promising future leaders completed one of 
these programmes in 2017.
We also continued to grow our online resources, through the 
Communisis Academy. This is our learning and development 
hub which provides all of our employees with access to tools 
and materials to support their ongoing developmental needs. 
It is a cloud-based system, available 24/7 regardless of where 
our employees are based. In 2017, we moved our annual review 
process to this platform, allowing a digital, flexible approach 
to managing objectives, performance and individuals’ 
development needs.
Our apprenticeship programme continues to grow. This now 
encompasses roles in IT, business administration and digital 
marketing. Plans are in place to have apprentices over four sites: 
Liverpool, Edinburgh, Leeds and Andover. 
In 2017, following the roll-out of the Apprenticeship Levy, we 
launched our programme of modern apprenticeships and now 
have over 60 colleagues across the Group completing 
qualifications ranging from Software Development to Business 
Administration and Improving Operational Performance to 
Leadership and Management.
Succession plans have been reviewed during the year and are in 
place for all senior and business-critical roles. These succession 
plans allow us to focus on learning and development 
requirements, as well as driving our diversity agenda by 
identifying key talent and providing support with tailored 
development programmes.
Recruiting the best talent is critical to our ongoing success. In 
2017, our partnership with Randstad Sourceright went live. This 
allows us to access the best recruitment tools and processes to 
support our line managers in finding the best people for their 
teams. In addition, this approach enhances our commitment 
to diversity and equality during the recruitment process by 
ensuring we follow best practice for ensuring fair and equitable 
recruitment processes. In 2017 we have made great strides in  
presenting ourselves as an employer of choice.  We are working 
hard to bring a greater awareness of Communisis to the 
recruitment marketplace, and help us attract the best new talent.  
More work will follow in 2018 to enhance this further.
RETAINING OUR PEOPLE THROUGH ENGAGEMENT 
AND REWARD
At Communisis we understand that the success of our business 
strategy is critically dependent upon the involvement of all 
employees. We appreciate that employee engagement and 
wellbeing not only benefit our employees but also have a direct 
impact upon the performance of our business and we seek to 
achieve that engagement in a number of ways. During 2017 we:
• held information and consultation forums, focus groups and 
internal surveys to listen to our teams;
• acted upon that feedback at local and Company levels;
• used various high-quality digital channels to ensure timely 
and effective flows of information; and
• developed improved and engaging visual communications 
to support our digital channels.
A healthy and safe working environment is central to everything 
we do. We are committed to providing our employees with a safe 
place to work combined with excellent occupational health services.
In 2017 we further enhanced our flexible benefits offering by 
expanding the offering on our benefits platform available within 
the UK. We are also constantly reviewing our international 
benefits offerings which vary by country linked to local legislation 
and practice.
We review remuneration regularly, benchmarking salaries where 
appropriate, and develop reward schemes which encourage and 
incentivise appropriately.
Our people also receive regular wellbeing communications and 
have the opportunity to engage in various advice and training 
initiatives on Wellbeing Days. Our aim is to ensure that our 
people work within an environment which is conducive to good 
health and wellbeing and that our programmes and initiatives 
positively affect our peoples’ lives both inside and outside of work. Strategic Report

DIVERSITY
We have an ongoing commitment to equality and diversity and 
have retained accreditation to the Committed2Equality
®
 standard 
in 2017.  Following an annual audit, our accreditation has 
remained at Gold standard, with an improved assessment result.
Communisis has focused on utilising appropriate recruitment 
processes and techniques to ensure we are able to reach all 
jobseekers. We are also committed to flexible working 
arrangements, and benefits provision, which assists staff with 
their work–life balance.
The Group has in place an Equal Opportunities Policy and 
Statement (details of which are set out below).  The ongoing 
commitment above, together with the Group’s Equal Opportunities 
Policy and Statement, comprises the Group’s policy on diversity.
EQUAL OPPORTUNITIES
Our policy is to provide equal opportunities to all existing and 
potential employees. We know that our reputation is dependent 
upon fair and equitable treatment of all our employees and we 
forbid discrimination on the grounds of race, religion, gender, 
disability, sexual orientation, age, nationality or ethnic origin. 
Employment opportunities are equally available to all.
Employment opportunities are available to disabled persons in 
accordance with their abilities and aptitudes on equal terms with 
other employees. If an employee becomes disabled during 
employment, we make every effort to enable them to continue in 
employment by making reasonable adjustments in the workplace 
and providing retraining for alternative work where necessary.
MENTAL HEALTH AND WELLBEING
In 2017 the business launched a significant initiative to support 
our people’s mental health and wellbeing. The initiative started 
by participating in Mental Health Awareness Week in May 2017, 
at the end of which we made three commitments:
• created a mental health and wellbeing group, to lead and 
drive initiatives to support our people;
• improved our internal support by training our HR team; and
• signed the “Time to change employer pledge” detailing our 
commitments (which included in 2018 creating mental health 
first aiders in the workplace).
This programme of works shows our commitment to our people 
and that we take the issue of mental health seriously and are 
committed to breaking down the taboo and helping end mental 
health discrimination in all workplaces. 
GENDER
We have a progressive policy towards gender equality. Whilst we 
have always taken the view that the most suitable candidate for 
any role should be the person who is appointed to that role, we 
recognise the benefits that diversity can bring to any 
organisation and have embraced that philosophy when making 
all appointments into the business.
Our recruitment partnership, with market leader Randstad 
Sourceright, involves coaching, training and up-skilling our line 
managers to help them support our approach to both diversity 
and gender equality. We also partner with CEB (now Gartner) for 
a suite of SHL psychometric assessment tools which ensure we 
have an objective and fair approach to candidate selection.
A breakdown by gender of the number of persons who were 
Directors, senior managers and employees of the Group as at

SUPPORTING OUR SUPPLIERS
Our supply chain is key to the success of Communisis. 
We work hand in hand with our suppliers to understand our 
environmental impact and we plan to do more in 2018 to 
establish a reliable source of data within the supply chain 
through the strategic adoption of Ecovadis (a supply chain 
management platform) which will give us greater insights into 
the businesses that we work with.
SUPPORTING OUR PEOPLE
Our aim is to give our employees rewarding careers that make 
the best use of the talents they have and also to equip them for 
the future by providing the opportunity to develop new skills. 
Most importantly, we want all our employees to feel they work for 
a company that treats them with respect and has values they 
can feel proud of. Our aim is to be the employer of choice for the 
best people in our markets.
SUPPORTING OUR COMMUNITIES
We actively encourage all employees to be socially active and 
participate in volunteering activities in the local community. 
We support this by allowing a paid volunteer day per employee 
per year.
Our Insight and MI team travelled to the heart of East London to 
St Luke’s Community Centre, where they worked hard to help 
revamp some donated picnic benches and help out with some 
gardening. They then helped clear one of the local parks by 
removing the fallen leaves and turning the soil, planting fresh 
plants and flowers to blossom in time for spring and summer. 
COMMUNISIS CHARITY AND VOLUNTEERING
Support for our nominated charities continued during 2017, led by 
our Charity Committee, which is made up of colleagues from all 
around the Group. Proceeds from all fundraising events went 
to Children in Need, Alzheimer’s Society and Macmillan Cancer 
Support. We will announce new nominated charity partners 
in 2018.
During 2017 our fundraising and donations amounted to £56,723, 
which has been distributed amongst our nominated charities. A 
further £1,275 was raised for other local charities giving a grand 
total of £57,998.
We continued to work with and support The Prince’s Trust 
through 2017, and will be doing so into 2018.
Our Volunteer Charity Champions represent all the business 
regions and support fundraising events, engage with other 
employees, set an example and are key to the success of our 
endeavours. Below are some of the events we enjoyed in 2017.
YORKSHIRE THREE PEAKS
On 7 July 2017, 47 Communisis employees took on the Yorkshire 
Three Peaks. Individuals either walked the 24-mile long route with 
5,200ft of ascent, or they supported those doing so. Everyone 
challenged themselves, whether that was to complete one peak, 
two peaks or all three.
483 bottles of water, 51 made-to-order sandwiches, 104 energy 
gels and a countless number of blisters later, everyone had 
completed the challenge coming in under the guideline of 
12 hours.
This event alone raised over £5,000.

BAKE SALES
Communisis is not alone in its love of cake, and in 2017 we held 
numerous bake sales. Highlights included Alzheimer’s Society 
Cupcake Day in June, and Macmillan Coffee Morning in September. 
All our sites got involved and raised thousands on behalf of these 
good causes in the process.
SUSTAINABILITY
Our work continued throughout 2017 with the sustainability 
forum, which is comprised of stakeholders from across the 
business who can offer insight and expertise in all areas of the 
business. The purpose of the forum is to share best practice, 
capture our achievements and help shape the future of 
sustainability within Communisis.
We are committed to the development, implementation and 
maintenance of an action plan to target improvements in our 
environmental and sustainability performance, in addition to 
helping our clients with theirs and to monitoring our progress 
over time.
HUMAN RIGHTS AND MODERN SLAVERY
We take the issue of human rights seriously.
The Modern Slavery Act 2015 has introduced changes in the 
UK law focusing on increasing transparency in supply chains.  
A copy of the Group’s slavery and human trafficking statement 
can be found on the Company’s website (www.communisis.com). 
We are committed to ensuring there is transparency in our 
approach in tackling modern slavery in our supply chain.
ANTI-BRIBERY POLICY
The Group’s anti-bribery policy sets out the ethical values 
required to ensure compliance with legal requirements. 
Anti-bribery and corruption training is provided across the 
Group to all employees. The training is provided via our 
online training portal.
Communisis values its reputation for ethical behaviour, financial 
integrity and reliability.  It acknowledges that over and above the 
commission of any crime, any involvement in bribery will also 
reflect adversely on its reputation.
Communisis’ aim is to limit its exposure to bribery and corruption by:
• setting out a policy on anti-bribery and corruption;
• training all employees so that they can recognise and avoid 
the use of bribery by themselves and others;
• providing employees with a suitable channel of communication 
and ensuring sensitive information is treated appropriately;
• rigorously investigating instances of alleged bribery and 
assisting the police and other appropriate authorities in any 
resultant prosecution; and
• taking firm and vigorous action against any individual involved 
in bribery or corruption. Strategic Report

HEALTH, SAFETY AND ENVIRONMENT
HEALTH, SAFETY AND ENVIRONMENTAL POLICY
Communisis operates a combined Health, Safety and 
Environmental Policy which strives to continuously improve our 
health, safety and environment (HSE) compliance by integrating HSE 
practices as core values into our business activities. This in turn 
significantly contributes to the commercial success of the business.
The Board Director responsible for implementation of the Health, 
Safety and Environmental Policy is the Chief Executive. 
KEEPING OUR PEOPLE SAFE
The main focus of our Health and Safety Programme is the 
prevention of injury and loss. We believe that all incidents are 
preventable and that our employees should be free to work in an 
environment that does not cause them injury or ill health.
In 2017, we were not subject to any regulatory enforcement 
resulting from any breaches of Health and Safety (H&S) 
legislation. All manufacturing locations maintained their safety 
management certifications to the externally verified standard of 
Occupational Health and Safety Assessment Standard 
18001:2007 (OHSAS). 
All endeavours are made to maintain a legally compliant 
business that operates without placing our employees, 
customers and visitors at risk of injury. We have a mature system 
of compliance checking through audit that enables us to monitor 
and improve our systems. This activity is compounded by and 
reinforced by external verification audits that are undertaken by 
SGS, our nominated external verification provider, to the 
standard of OHSAS that we operate in our production sites.
In 2017 we combined the Health and Safety Policy with our 
Environmental Policy to create one unified document. 
We continue to offer a cycle to work scheme and now have more 
colleagues than ever enjoying the benefits of a healthier lifestyle 
that this has brought to them.
We continue to utilise our online training portal to provide our 
H&S training. This portal enables us to provide consistent training 
throughout the organisation. In addition we have utilised other 
forms of training including face-to-face training to raise line 
management awareness of HSE issues across our 
operational facilities.
PERFORMANCE AGAINST HEALTH, SAFETY AND 
ENVIRONMENTAL POLICY OBJECTIVES
• Demonstrate proactive leadership and management for the 
prevention of incidents, ill-health and environmental pollution.
We have continued to be proactive in our approach to safety 
and environmental management through the implementation 
of initiatives such as line management responsibility training, 
incident investigation awareness training and an increased 
focus on hazard observation and reporting. Other areas such 
as occupational health surveillance and mental health 
awareness have also been the focus of Group-wide initiatives.
• Demonstrate continuous improvements to our HSE management 
systems to reduce HSE risk and maintain legal compliance.
All operational facilities have maintained their OHSAS and 
International Organisation for Standardisation (ISO) 14001:2004 
management system, with two locations making the conversion to 
the new ISO 14001:2015 standard. T o provide assurance that this effort 
is directed in the correct manner, we have a rolling programme of 
internal audit reviews covering legal and process compliance.
• Engage and consult with personnel to ensure their competency, 
awareness and ability to work safely and in an environmentally 
responsible manner through the provision of supervision, 
information, instruction and training.
All operational facilities operate an employee forum where 
HSE issues are discussed and improvements are agreed. 
Many of the forums liaise directly with local unions, where 
representation is held, to ensure that good communication, 
information, instruction and training is provided to all areas of 
our operations. Our new online training portal has also enabled 
us to deploy training to a greater population of the workforce 
and provides consistency in the quality of the training.
• Manage performance by monitoring and taking corrective action 
and ensure efficiency of communication for a positive culture.
We use a software-based system to manage various aspects 
of HSE documentation. This includes hazard observation 
records, risk assessment records, audit schedule and 
non-conformance tracking. 
• Monitor and manage our environmental impacts based on 
energy usage, waste management and supply chain practices.
Each operational facility monitors its energy use to reduce 
energy wastage. High standards of waste segregation and 
recycling are present across the business. 
We have renewed our Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) and 
Programme for the Endorsement of Forest Certification (PEFC) for 
the next three years showing our dedication to sustainable 
sourcing of the materials we use.
We operate a greenhouse gas management system which 
enables us to accurately record and report our emissions. This 
system ensures consistency and transparency in our activities 
and is written to support ISO 14064-1.
We recognise that water scarcity and water pollution are a major 
global environmental challenge and we take all practicable steps 
to ensure that we manage our impact on these resources with 
the care that it requires. Water consumption and waste 
generation across our operations are monitored and managed 
to ensure our environmental impact is as low as possible. Strategic Report

HEALTH AND SAFETY PERFORMANCE
The reportable incident frequency rate (RIFR) has reduced slightly to 
0.12 from 0.13. This is due to improved return to work processes utilising 
our external healthcare provider and Employee Assistance Programme. 
The lost time incident frequency rate (LTIFR) (referred to 
previously as Lost Time Accident Frequency Rate (LTAFR)) has 
increased to 0.27 from 0.22*. As a result of this increase, the 
business has taken additional risk management measures to 
ensure that relevant learnings were widely communicated, risk 
assessment controls reviewed and additional training completed.
*2016 numbers have been restated to reflect more accurate data.
Both frequency rates are calculated by taking the number of 
incidents multiplying by 100,000 (as the typical number of hours 
that a facility of 100 employees would work across 50 weeks per 
year) and dividing this by the total number of hours worked 
(based on permanent employees, temporary employees, agency 
employees and sub-contractor employees).

there were 11 Lost Time Incidents and six RIDDORs respectively.

ENVIRONMENTAL PERFORMANCE
ENVIRONMENTAL LEGAL COMPLIANCE
Communisis has maintained all its relevant environmental 
certifications and operational permits and has not been subject 
to any improvement, abatement or enforcement notices. We 
frequently evaluate our compliance against relevant environment 
legislation through a programme of auditing and review against 
current legislation.
CARBON REDUCTION COMMITMENT (CRC) AND 
GREENHOUSE GAS (GHG)
Full compliance was achieved with CRC Phase 2 during 2017. This 
aspect of our compliance was done in conjunction with Carbon 
Credentials Energy Services Limited, our compliance partner, 
which we continue to partner with to provide us with technical 
advice and support. 
GHG REPORTING
We continuously review and modify current reporting practices 
in order to fully meet compliance requirements. Aside from 
continuous improvement of monitoring and measurement of 
activity data, we ensure that there are internal controls in place 
in order to avoid the risk of any material discrepancy within 
this report.  Strategic Report

CARBON INTENSITY
We have updated our carbon intensity calculation for 2017 and 
moved away from the previous measure that referred to paper 
consumption. Going forward we will be reporting on two new 
measures that we believe give greater insight into the 
performance of the Group as a whole.  
We have elected to report: 
1) tonnes of CO
2
e per square footage of our property portfolio; and  
2)  tonnes of CO
2
e from business travel against our average 
employee headcount during the year.

Year-on-year there has been a  positive improvement in carbon 
intensity performance across our property portfolio that we own 
or lease. This can be attributed to energy efficiency projects that 
have been introduced. For instance, LED lighting and energy 
efficient compressors have been installed in various parts of 
our operations.

2014
Our carbon intensity for travel (as a ratio of average headcount) 
shows a small reduction during 2017 (0.560) compared to 2016 (0.572). 
This can be attributed to the continued focus on restricting travel and 
improving our internal communication technology. The rate has 
however increased from 2014 and 2015 levels (with an average of 
0.456). This is due to an increased amount of international travel that 
occurred as our global presence has increased. The headcount 
calculation includes permanent employees, temporary employees, 
agency employees and subcontractor employees.
For the purposes of reporting, any sites that were acquired or 
divested during a particular year will not have its square footage 
or energy included in the calculation. 
As part of our continuous improvement process and our 
obligation to report GHG emissions, we will continue to provide 
verification of the emissions statements and data made by the 
Company in accordance with ISO 14064-3. Our current status is 
maintained at the top scoring of “reasonable assurance” as 
verified by our external third-party partner.
ENVIRONMENTAL PERFORMANCE MONITORING
ECOVADIS
Ecovadis is a supply chain management process that allows us 
to communicate our sustainability performance to our clients 
across a common platform. This provides us with an externally 
verified score based on our approach to the environment, labour 
practices and human rights, fair business practices, sustainable 
procurement and associated KPIs. 
In 2017 we maintained a silver rating which placed us in the top 
30% of subscribers.
CARBON DISCLOSURE PROJECT (CDP)
Our climate change programme submission for 2017 was completed for both our Company performance and the way in which our 
supply chain is managed. We have maintained our “A-“ score. 
Year 2014 2015 2016 2017
Scope 1 1,603 1,571 1,630 1,816

Scope 3 1,012 784 951 930
Total gross carbon TCO 2 e 11,737 10,869 10,067 8,884
The above table shows the audited and verified data by our external third party partner. Scope 1 emissions are those that occur from 
sources that the Company own and directly manage or control.  These have increased  due to an increase in our production activity.
Scope 2 emissions are those that are generated from the purchased electricity that the Company consumed and have decreased because 
our operational facilities continue to be more energy efficient through the process improvements that were implemented during 2017 .
Scope 3 emissions occur as a consequence of our activities, but occur from sources that are not owned nor controlled by us. These 
have reduced due to fewer European and domestic flights. Corporate Governance

This report, with the Directors’ Remuneration Report, describes 
how the Board applies the principles of the UK Corporate 
Governance Code issued by the Financial Reporting Council, 
which is publicly available at www.frc.org.uk/Our-Work/
Publications/Corporate-Governance/UK-Corporate-Governance-
Code-2016.pdf.
UK CORPORATE GOVERNANCE CODE COMPLIANCE
During the year under review, the Company has complied 
with the main provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code 
(April 2016) (the Code).
BOARD STRUCTURE
The Board currently comprises the Chairman, two Executive 
Directors and three independent Non-executive Directors. David 
Gilbertson was appointed as an independent Non-Executive 
Director on 1 March 2017 and took over as Chairman at the close 
of the AGM on 11 May 2017, when Peter Hickson stepped down 
from the Board. On 4 December 2017 Mark Stoner, Executive 
Director and Finance Director, stepped down from the Board. 
Steve Rawlins was appointed as an Executive Director and Chief 
Financial Officer on 4 December 2017. We have announced today 
that Helen Keays will be leaving the business on 6 June 2018. The 
Nomination Committee will conduct an external search for a 
new Non-executive Director.
The roles and responsibilities of the Chairman and Chief Executive 
are set out in separate documents outlining their respective roles. 
The Chairman’s role fulfils a number of objectives including 
ethical leadership of the Board, ensuring the Board agenda 
focuses on strategy, value creation, performance and 
accountability, appropriate identification and supervision 
of significant risks, effective communication with shareholders 
and that the Board as a whole acts efficiently in delivering the 
agreed strategies.
The Chief Executive is responsible for operational management 
of the Group, leading the development and implementation of 
strategy, setting and monitoring of budgets and other financial 
objectives, organisational structure and setting and delivery of 
objectives of direct reports, all for consideration by the Board.
Consistent with their role as part of a unitary board, the Non-
executive Directors constructively challenge and help develop 
Company proposals on strategy. They also test the integrity of 
financial information, ensure financial controls are appropriate 
and robust, determine appropriate levels of remuneration for 
Executive Directors and have a pivotal role in succession planning.
Biographical details of the Board as at the date of this report can 
be found on pages 34 and 35.
The Chairman does not have any other significant commitments 
in addition to those detailed in his biography.
CONFLICTS OF INTEREST
The Company’s Articles of Association contain provisions 
permitting Directors to take up any position that conflicts, or 
may possibly conflict, with the interests of the Company provided 
those Directors have sought authorisation from the Board before 
doing so. All existing external appointments for each Director 
have been authorised by the Board and a register of interests 
is kept and reviewed on a regular basis. All Directors have been 
made aware of the need to consult the Company Secretary 
about any possible conflicts which may arise, so that prior 
consideration can be given by the Board to whether or not 
such conflict will be authorised.
BOARD PROCEEDINGS
The Board schedules eight or nine meetings each year, and also 
meets at other times as appropriate. During 2017 there were nine 
scheduled meetings and two ad hoc meetings (some of which 
were conducted by telephone). The table opposite shows the 
attendance of each Director at meetings of the Board and its 
standing Committees during the year. Details of membership 
of Committees are set out on pages 34 and 35. Corporate Governance
37 Communisis plc  Annual Report and Financial Statements 2017
The Company has adopted a schedule of matters reserved for 
Board approval which is reviewed annually and includes:
• strategy;
• budget approval and monitoring of performance;
• acquisitions and disposals;
• approval of the Annual Report, interim, preliminary and other 
market updates on the Company’s performance;
• approval of significant contracts; and
• approval of Group policies.
The Company ensures that the Board is supplied with 
appropriate and timely information to enable it to discharge its 
duties. Directors may seek independent professional advice if 
necessary, at the expense of the Company. All Directors have 
access to the services of the Company Secretary.
During the year under review the Chairman held meetings with 
the Non-executive Directors in the absence of the Executive 
Directors to discuss a range of issues including strategy, financial 
performance, progress towards targets, management 
performance and management succession.
RE-ELECTION
In accordance with the Code recommendation, all members of 
the Board will be submitting themselves for re-election at this 
year’s AGM to be held on 10 May 2018, with the exception of Steve 
Rawlins, who will be standing for election, and Helen Keays who 
will be leaving the business on 6 June 2018 and therefore will not 
be offering herself for re-election at this year’s AGM.
As a result of consideration of the Directors’ input throughout the 
year and the Board evaluation process referred to below, the 
Board is satisfied that all the Directors continue to demonstrate 
the level of skills and commitment to be fully effective in their 
respective roles as members of the Board.
NON-EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR INDEPENDENCE
Having considered the criteria for independence within the Code, 
the Board is satisfied that David Gilbertson, Jane Griffiths, Peter 
Harris and Helen Keays remain independent.
INDUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
A formal and comprehensive induction process is in place for 
new Directors, which includes an information pack and 
personalised induction programme. This programme is tailored 
to the needs of each Director and agreed with him or her so that 
he or she can gain a better understanding of the Company.
Steve Rawlins, further to his appointment on 4 December 2017, 
is currently undergoing a formal and comprehensive induction 
including site tours and meetings with senior management at 
the Company’s main operating sites.
In order to ensure that Directors continue to further their 
understanding of the issues facing the Company, presentations 
are made to the Board on key topics throughout the year. This 
gives the Directors the opportunity to meet the management 
teams across the Group and improve their knowledge and 
understanding of the different areas of the Group.
The Directors also receive regular briefings on upcoming 
developments and, if required, training is arranged to cover 
specific areas for which the Directors need to have a more 
in-depth knowledge.

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE REPORT CONTINUED
the Committee are made by the Board, which considers the 
required balance of skills and expertise required for the Committee.
The Committee meets as required but not less than three times 
a year. Three meetings were held during 2017. It also meets in the 
absence of management for discussions with the external auditor 
and in the absence of the external auditor when undertaking its 
annual appraisal of the performance of the auditor.
The Committee’s primary function is to oversee and manage 
the appointment of and relationship with the Group’s external 
auditor and to monitor and review the activities of the internal 
audit function to ensure appropriately robust and effective 
financial controls are in place and are adhered to.
The Committee is provided with sufficient resources to undertake 
its duties and has access to the Company Secretary, who acts as 
secretary to the Committee, and all other employees. It may also 
take independent legal or professional advice at the expense of 
the Group when it believes it is necessary.
The Audit Committee Report is set out on pages 42 and 43.
NOMINATION COMMITTEE
Details of the Nomination Committee are set out in the 
Nomination Committee Report on pages 40 and 41.
REMUNERATION COMMITTEE
Details of the Remuneration Committee are set out in the 
Directors’ Remuneration Report on pages 44 to 59.
ADMINISTRATION AND FINANCE COMMITTEE
The Committee comprises any two Directors, one of 
whom must be the Chairman, the Chief Executive or the 
Chief Financial Officer. It may appoint its own Chairman 
and it meets when necessary.
It is empowered by the Board to:
• administer the Company’s share schemes in accordance with 
the Board’s policy (and any specific decisions of the 
Remuneration Committee that concern participation by 
Directors and/or senior employees);
• borrow money (by entering into new or replacement facilities) 
needed by the business, enter into finance leases and operate 
existing banking facilities (within the limit set by the Group’s 
borrowing facilities immediately before taking action and 
subject to a transaction limit of £10m); and
• enter into guarantees or indemnities where they are a 
necessary incidental of the exercise of the powers above.
BOARD EVALUATION
A Board performance evaluation is conducted annually with the 
most recent being December 2017 . The evaluation process was 
based on a questionnaire devised for the purpose and circulated to 
the Directors. The performance of the Board as a whole and of each 
of its principal Committees was considered and included issues such 
as: the assessment and monitoring of the Group’s strategy and risks; 
the mix of knowledge and skills on the Board; processes and 
procedures; oversight; ethics and compliance. The results were 
collated by the Company Secretary and reviewed by the Chairman, 
who reported significant themes to the Board for further 
consideration and discussion. The objectives for 2018 are: 
• explore ways for the Non-executive Directors to gain a more 
detailed understanding of the challenges faced by different 
areas of the business in order to facilitate insightful 
contributions to strategy discussions;
• increase the proportion of Board time spent on strategic 
issues; and
• to undertake a full review of Board members’ skills and 
experience, to ensure that the appropriate skills and 
experience are in place to execute the strategy.
The evaluation process for 2018 is planned for the fourth quarter 
of the year.
BOARD COMMITTEES
The Board has four Committees: Audit, Remuneration, 
Nomination and Administration and Finance, all of which have 
terms of reference which are reviewed annually and deal 
specifically with their authorities and duties. The terms of 
reference may be viewed on the Company’s website.
Only the Committee Chairman and Committee members are 
entitled to be present at the Audit, Remuneration and 
Nomination Committee meetings but others may attend by 
invitation.
AUDIT COMMITTEE
During the year, the Audit Committee comprised:
• Peter Harris (Chairman);
• David Gilbertson (from 1 March 2017);
• Jane Griffiths; and
• Helen Keays.
Peter Hickson stepped down from the Board and the Audit 
Committee on 11 May 2017.
Peter Harris is assessed as having the required recent and relevant 
financial expertise required by the Committee. All appointments to  Corporate Governance
39 Communisis plc  Annual Report and Financial Statements 2017
INTERNAL CONTROL AND RISK MANAGEMENT
The Board is responsible for maintaining a sound system of 
internal control in the Group and reviewing the effectiveness of 
financial, operational and compliance controls.
This system is designed to provide assurance to the Group’s 
objectives of reliable financial reporting, operational 
effectiveness and efficiency, compliance with laws, regulations 
and policies and the safeguarding of assets. The system aims to 
manage, rather than eliminate, the risk of failure to achieve 
business objectives. By its nature, it provides reasonable, but not 
absolute, assurance against material misstatement or loss.
The Group has an independent internal audit function which has 
a direct line of communication to the Audit Committee 
Chairman. The principal role in fulfilling the internal audit 
function is to review the adequacy and effectiveness of the 
controls operating within the business by undertaking an agreed 
schedule of independent audits each year. The nature and scope 
of this annual audit programme is reviewed in advance by the 
Audit Committee each year and may be updated from time to 
time according to changing business circumstances and 
requirements. The findings of these audits are reported in 
accordance with the internal audit terms of reference and any 
necessary corrective actions are agreed and monitored. 
Summaries of these reports are presented to, and discussed with, 
the Audit Committee along with details of progress against 
action plans as appropriate.
The Board has overall accountability for ensuring that risks are 
effectively managed across the Group. In addition, the internal 
audit function within the Group also has responsibilities for the 
risk management programme. A summary of this process is 
provided as part of the Viability Statement on page 18.
RELATIONS WITH SHAREHOLDERS
An important role of the Board is to represent and promote the 
interests of its shareholders as well as being accountable to them 
for the performance and activities of the Company.
The Board believes it is very important to engage with its 
shareholders and its main channel of communication to institutional 
investors is through the Chief Executive and Chief Financial Officer 
via investor roadshows, broker organised conferences, face-to-
face meetings and the AGM.
The Company is a member of the Quoted Companies Alliance 
(QCA), which enhances access to leading small and mid-cap 
investors and helps the Company better understand its key 
criteria in making investment decisions.
Following the Company’s preliminary and interim results 
announcements, presentations are made to analysts and 
major shareholders to update them on the progress the 
Company has made towards its strategic objectives and invite 
them to ask questions.
Full details on results presentations, RNS releases and trading 
updates are available on the Company’s website.
In 2017 Andy Blundell utilised internet video channels via the 
Proactive Investor website to extend links to investors.
The Chairman and Senior Independent Director are also 
available to speak with major shareholders and brief the Board 
to ensure that they are aware of the views of shareholders.
Additionally the retail market has been kept in focus with direct 
communication and through intermediaries (private client brokers).
Information in relation to those who have a significant direct or 
indirect holding in the Company are set out in the Directors’ 
Report on page 62.
GENDER DIVERSITY

throughout the year. Three meetings were held throughout 2017 and 
attendance records of the meetings held during the year can be found on 
page 37.
COMPOSITION

• David Gilbertson (Chairman) (Committee member from 1 March 2017, 
Chairman from 11 May 2017);
• Jane Griffiths;
• Peter Harris; and
• Helen Keays.
Peter Hickson stepped down from the Board and Chairman of the 
Nomination Committee on 11 May 2017.

KEY ACTIONS TAKEN DURING 2017
As part of its role to review the composition of the Board, during 
2017 the Nomination Committee recommended the appointment 
of a new Non-executive Director who would also replace Peter 
Hickson as Chairman of the Board and Chairman of the 
Nomination Committee at the close of the 2017 AGM. The 
Nomination Committee evaluated the balance of skills, 
experience, independence and knowledge of the Board before 
preparing a detailed candidate specification, which defined the 
criteria for the new appointee, in particular, looking for a 
candidate with the relevant skills to take on the roles of Chairman 
of the Board and Chairman of the Nomination Committee. 
The specification was agreed by the Nomination Committee. 
Peter Hickson stepped down from the Board as Non-executive 
Chairman with effect from 11 May 2017. I was appointed as a 
Non-executive Director on 1 March 2017 and as Non-executive 
Chairman with effect from 11 May 2017 and will offer myself for 
re-election at the May 2018 AGM.
In accordance with the requirements of the specification, an 
independent external search agency (Warren Partners) was 
engaged to assist with the search for suitable candidates. 
Warren Partners has no other connection with the Company. A 
short-list of potential candidates was produced and these were 
interviewed by the Senior Independent Director, Chairman of the 
Nomination Committee and Group Human Resources Director. 
The final candidates were then interviewed by the other Non-
executive Directors. Following those interviews, the final 
candidate was selected and then met by the Executive Directors. 
I was selected as Non-executive Director for my extensive 
knowledge and experience in relevant industry sectors and 
suitability to take over as Chairman of the Board and Chairman 
of the Nomination Committee when Peter Hickson stepped down 
at the AGM on 11 May 2017. Peter Hickson was not involved in the 
final decision on the appointment of his upcoming successor.
The process described above was also followed in respect of the 
appointment of Steve Rawlins as an Executive Director and Chief 
Financial Officer with effect from 4 December 2017. In connection 
with Steve Rawlins’ appointment, the Committee used the 
services of Spencer Stuart (which has no other connection with 
the Company). Mark Stoner stepped down as an Executive 
Director and Finance Director with effect from 4 December 2017.
It has been announced today that Helen Keays will be leaving the 
business on 6 June 2018. The Board would like to thank Helen for 
her commitment and contribution over the years and to wish her 
every success for the future. The Committee will conduct an 
external search for a new Non-executive Director.
Following the appointment of a new Director, the Chairman, in 
conjunction with the Company Secretary and the Group Human 
Resources Director, has responsibility for ensuring that a full, 
formal and tailored induction to the Company is provided. Such 
induction includes one-to-one meetings with key management, 
an overview of the Group’s structure, strategy and operations, 
and site visits.
The Committee also carefully reviews and makes 
recommendations concerning the re-appointment of any 
Non-executive Director at the conclusion of their specified term 
of office. The Committee considered the positions of Peter Harris, 
Jane Griffiths, and myself. It was the Committee’s view that it 
would be in the best interests of the Company’s shareholders, 
subject to careful and rigorous review, for each of the 
Non-executive Directors to offer themselves for re-election at the 
2018 AGM. In the Committee’s view, each of the Directors bring 
considerable management experience and an independent 
perspective to the Board’s discussions and are considered to be 
independent of management and free from relationship or 
circumstance that could affect, or appear to affect, the exercise 
of their independent judgement, therefore providing continued 
valuable support. Helen Keays will be leaving the business on 6 
June 2018 and therefore will not be offering herself for re-election 
at this year’s AGM.
DIVERSITY
The Board recognises the recommendations and benefits to the 
Group of diversity in the workforce and in the composition of the 
Board itself. Whilst the Company will always make appointments 
based on the best candidate for the role, it does take into 
consideration the recommendations within the Davies Report and 
seeks to follow the Code. In 2017 female Directors accounted for 
33.3% of the Board composition. More details on diversity and 
gender across the Group can be found on page 27 . The Committee 
will also consider the Parker Review findings on ethnic and cultural 
diversity when making future appointments to the Board.

AUDIT COMMITTEE REPORT
ANNUAL STATEMENT BY THE CHAIRMAN OF THE AUDIT COMMITTEE
The Committee has continued to perform its duties in respect of its terms of 
reference, a copy of which is available on the Company’s website.
Three meetings were held during the year, two of which were scheduled to 
coincide with the Board’s review and approval of the Group’s interim 
statement and of its preliminary results announcement based on the Annual 
Report and Financial Statements. Attendance records of the meetings held 
during the year can be found on page 37.
ROLE AND RESPONSIBILITIES
Broadly, the key activities and responsibilities of the Committee have been to 
review and challenge, where necessary:
• the effectiveness of the Group’s internal controls, audit function and risk 
management programme;
• the financial reporting process, including the adoption of critical 
accounting policies and practices;
• the independence and effectiveness of the external auditor;
• the Group’s procedures and arrangements for handling any allegations 
from whistleblowers; and
• to report to the Board any action required if a material cause for concern, 
or scope for improvement, is discovered.
COMPOSITION
The Committee is composed entirely of Non-executive Directors. 
The composition of the Audit Committee during the year was:
• Peter Harris (Chairman);
• Jane Griffiths;
• Helen Keays; and
• David Gilbertson (Committee member from 1 March 2017).
Peter Hickson stepped down from the Board as a Committee member of the 
Audit Committee on 11 May 2017.
The relevant experience of each member is described on pages 34 and 35.
INTERNAL AUDIT AND CONTROL
The Group’s system of operational and internal financial control is subject to 
regular internal and external audits including those conducted on behalf of 
clients under contractual arrangements.
There were 419 separate audits completed during 2017. This activity covered 
areas of compliance including information security, quality, health and 
safety, environmental matters and business continuity arrangements in 
addition to financial reporting and internal controls.
The internal and external audit plans are set and approved in the context of 
a developing assurance reporting process and are flexed to deal with any 
changes with respect to the risk profile of the Group.
The Group’s internal audit function reports independently and directly to the 
Audit Committee Chairman and maintains regular communication outside 
of the scheduled Committee meetings.
AUDIT COMMITTEE Corporate Governance
43 Communisis plc  Annual Report and Financial Statements 2017
The FRC noted one matter in relation to pension disclosures 
where they believed that users of the accounts would benefit from 
improvements to existing disclosures.  As a result, we have taken the 
opportunity to improve our disclosures in relation to our pension 
funding investment strategy in our 2017 Annual Report and Financial 
Statements.  The FRC’s review covered only the specific disclosures 
relating to the thematic review of pensions disclosures, and was not 
intended to provide any assurance that the report and accounts were 
correct in all material respects.
EXTERNAL AUDIT
The Committee has responsibility for making a recommendation 
on the appointment, re-appointment and removal of the external 
auditor. The external auditor’s appointment is reviewed periodically 
and the lead audit partner is rotated at least once every five 
years. Ernst & Young LLP has been the Group’s external auditor 
since September 2002, when the last audit tender took place. 
A new audit partner was rotated onto the audit during the year 
as the previous partner had completed five annual audits.
The Committee is aware of the EU mandated requirement for auditor 
rotation and will monitor any legal or regulatory developments.
The Committee reviews reports from Ernst & Young LLP as part of 
the annual audit process. These cover the scope, approach and 
results of the external audit and include the procedures adopted for 
safeguarding the firm’s independence and objectivity. The quality 
and content of these reports, together with the performance and 
behaviour of the audit teams during the exercise of their duties, 
inform the Committee’s assessment of audit effectiveness.
The external auditor meets privately with the Committee after 
each meeting without any member of the executive 
management team being present.
The Committee has an established policy for determining the 
non-audit services that the external auditor can provide and the 
procedures required for pre-approval of any such engagement. 
This allows the Committee to satisfy itself that auditor objectivity 
and independence are safeguarded. The split between audit and 
non-audit fees for the year ended 31 December 2017 and the 
nature of the non-audit services provided appear in Note 5.5 to the 
Consolidated Financial Statements. Non-audit fees totalled £20,000 
in respect of other assurance and advisory services provided during 
2017. Given the type of non-audit services provided and at 9% of 
the external audit fee of £235,000, they are not considered by the 
Committee to be of a nature or at a level that compromises the 
objectivity and independence of the external auditor.
Upon the recommendation of the Committee, Ernst & Young LLP 
will be proposed for re-appointment as auditor by shareholders 
at the AGM on 10 May 2018.
Peter Harris
Chairman of the Audit Committee

RISK MANAGEMENT
The Group has an established risk management programme, details 
of which are provided in the Strategic Report and Corporate 
Governance sections. The risk focus has been on the changes in data 
protection legislation, data control assurance and cyber security.
The Committee also kept a keen eye upon health, safety and 
environment which involved reviewing internal controls and 
challenging how risks are appropriately managed. The impact 
of the exit from the European Union was also considered in the 
context of the Group’s strategic risks.
SIGNIFICANT MATTERS RELATED TO THE 
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
The Committee assesses whether suitable accounting policies 
have been adopted, and appropriate estimates and judgements 
have been made, based upon a review of accounting papers 
which have been prepared by management providing details of 
significant financial reporting issues, together with reports from 
the external auditor prepared in contemplation of the interim 
and full-year results. Any issues arising are discussed with the 
external auditor together with any other matters which the 
auditor wishes to bring to the Committee’s attention.
In 2017, such issues included revenue recognition, goodwill 
impairment and internal controls.
Of the matters considered during the year, the most significant 
were revenue recognition and goodwill valuation:
• the Committee continued to monitor the established Group policies 
for revenue recognition to ensure that they remained appropriate, 
robust and were consistently applied; and
• recoverability of goodwill is reviewed on an ongoing basis and 
an assessment of whether any impairment of goodwill is 
required is performed at least annually. The principal 
judgements relate to the assumptions underlying the calculation 
of the value in use of the segmental businesses, primarily 
whether the long-term plans are achievable, the reasonableness 
of the overall macro-economic factors that underlie the 
valuation process and the suitability of the discount rate used to 
determine the present value of future cash flows. The Committee 
assessed this issue by considering management prepared 
papers and by reviewing reports from the external auditor, both 
of which describe the supporting methodology, the rationale 
and support for the key assumptions in the context of market 
comparators and the associated sensitivities. The Committee’s 
conclusion was that a goodwill impairment was not required.
The key areas of focus during 2018 include the General Data 
Protection Regulation which is effective from May 2018, and the 
implementation of new International Financial Reporting 
Standards (IFRS) in respect of lease accounting (IFRS 16) and 
revenue from contracts with customers (IFRS 15).
As part of the Financial Reporting Council’s (FRC) thematic review 
into pension disclosures, the Company was notified that the pension 
disclosures in its 2016 Annual Report and Accounts would be reviewed.   Corporate Governance

DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION REPORT
ANNUAL STATEMENT FROM THE  
CHAIR OF THE REMUNERATION COMMITTEE
DEAR SHAREHOLDER
I am pleased to present the Directors’ Remuneration Report for the year 
ended 31 December 2017 on behalf of the Board.
This Remuneration Report is split into two sections:
• this letter introducing the Directors’ Remuneration Report; and
• the Annual Report on Remuneration.
Our Directors’ Remuneration Policy, which was approved by our shareholders 
at the 2017 AGM, is set out for reference in the Appendix to this report.
REMUNERATION IN 2017
2017 was a year of continued progress for Communisis despite challenging trading 
conditions in a number of our markets. As a consequence of this performance and 
the related growth in profits, the Committee was pleased to approve the payment 
of annual bonuses for 2017 , albeit at broadly threshold levels for our Executive 
Directors (Andy Blundell only) for 2017 (30% of base salary).  However , we do expect 
to approve the vesting of part of the 2015 Long T erm Incentive Plan (L TIP) award.  
The EPS condition for this award (80% weighting) has been met.  A total of 
55.066% of this part vested; the share price condition (20% weighting) will be 
measured after the performance period for this part ends on 15 April 2018.
The Committee also undertook the following actions in 2017:
• base salaries were reviewed for Executive Directors as part of the normal, 
annual review of Company-wide salaries. In line with the levels of increases 
made to all staff, the Chief Executive’s salary was increased by 1% from 
1 July 2017; there was no pay increase awarded to the Finance Director 
in the year;
• further LTIP awards were made to Executive Directors on 10 March 2017;
• the treatment of remuneration items for the Finance Director who stepped 
down from our Board on 4 December 2017 (Mark Stoner) were determined 
(as more fully described on page 49 of this report); and
• the remuneration for Steve Rawlins who joined us on 4 December 2017 as 
an Executive Director and Chief Financial Officer was approved.  Details of 
Steve’s remuneration arrangements for 2018 are set out in this report.
REMUNERATION POLICY IN 2018
We were very pleased to receive over 94% support when we renewed our 
Directors’ Remuneration Policy at our 2017 AGM.
For 2018, we have had to consider as a Committee whether our policy 
remains appropriate for Communisis and capable of supporting our revised 
strategic vision as more fully explained in the Chairman’s Statement at the 
beginning of this Annual Report.  Having undertaken a review, we concluded 
that our current policy as approved at the 2017 AGM remains appropriate. 
We are thus not seeking to amend our policy at the 2018 AGM.
We have, however, decided to make certain changes in the way in which we 
will implement our policy in 2018. These modifications are permitted within 
our current policy and so we do not propose to seek a further policy 
approval at the 2018 AGM. 
REMUNERATION COMMITTEE Corporate Governance
45 Communisis plc  Annual Report and Financial Statements 2017
SHAREHOLDER APPROVAL
At the AGM on 10 May 2018, shareholders will be invited to approve 
the 2017 Directors’ Remuneration Report as set out on pages 44 to 52. 
We are not seeking further approval from shareholders for our 
policy (as set out for information in the Appendix to the Directors’ 
Remuneration Report) at the 2018 AGM.
Our shareholders’ support for the resolution on the 2017 Directors’ 
Remuneration Report which will be proposed at the 2018 AGM is 
important for us as a Board and I would recommend all 
shareholders to vote for this resolution.
Yours sincerely
Helen Keays
Chair of the Remuneration Committee

INTRODUCTION
This report is presented in two parts.
The first part constitutes the Annual Report on Remuneration. 
This outlines how the Committee implemented the Directors’ 
Remuneration Policy for the financial year ended 31 December 
2017. This report, together with the Annual Statement from the 
Chair of the Remuneration Committee, will be put to 
shareholders for approval at the AGM to be held on 10 May 2018. 
Shareholder approval is on an advisory basis only.
The second part is an Appendix containing the Directors’ 
Remuneration Policy, as approved by the Company’s shareholders 
at the Company’s AGM on 11 May 2017, which is reproduced here 
for information. For completeness, the “scenario charts” in the 
Directors’ Remuneration Policy have been updated to reflect 
Steve Rawlins’ remuneration arrangements for 2018.
The Company has complied with the principles and provisions 
relating to Directors’ remuneration in the UK Corporate 
Governance Code, and these reports have been prepared 
in accordance with the Large and Medium-sized Companies 
and Groups (Accounts and Reports) (Amendment) Regulations 
2013 (the Regulations). Where information disclosed has been 
subject to audit by the Company’s auditor, Ernst & Young LLP, 
this is highlighted.
In summary, the changes which we are making are as follows:
• whilst the same performance measures from 2017 (Adjusted 
EBIT (50%), free cash flow (25%) and personal objectives (25%)) 
will apply to the 2018 annual bonus, in 2018 the percentage of 
maximum bonus payable for on-target performance will be 
increased from 50% of maximum to 65% of maximum; and
• within our LTIP, we are again seeking to make annual awards 
subject to an equally weighted (50:50) mix of three-year EPS 
growth and three-year absolute TSR growth targets.  For both 
measures the growth rates required for vesting are between 
5% CAGR (25% vesting of that part) and 10% CAGR (100% 
vesting of that part).  For 2017’s awards the equivalent ranges 
were a 5% to 15% CAGR for three-year EPS and a 7.5% to 17.5% 
CAGR for TSR with 15% of the award vesting at the threshold 
level for both measures.
The changes which we have made were not matters undertaken 
lightly by the Committee, but we are under an obligation to act in 
the interests of our shareholders and in this regard we 
considered it important that our incentive plans align with our 
revised strategy and support its delivery.  The performance 
targets which we have set for the LTIP are aligned to the growth 
aspirations set out in the Chairman’s Statement.  Accordingly, the 
target ranges are, we believe, appropriately stretching in light of 
our revised strategy and, if achieved, will deliver strong 
performance for our shareholders in the prevailing business 
climate in our industry.
Additionally we would ask our shareholders to note that:
• for absolute TSR we are starting the measurement point for the 
2018 to 2020 three-year cycle from a significantly higher base 
point than in 2017 (Communisis’ TSR in financial year 2017 
increased by 55.3%);
• we strongly believe in our incentive plans being “self-funding”, 
and hence the heavy emphasis on profits-based measures 
within our plans (adjusted EBIT, EPS) against which the costs of 
all bonuses and share plans are charged; and
• we set appropriately stretching targets for our annual bonus:
• our five-year average bonus outcome for the Chief Executive 
is 34.4% of maximum bonus levels; and
• to ensure affordability, even if our free cash flow and personal 
objectives measures for annual bonus are attained at levels 
higher than the equivalent performance on our adjusted EBIT 
measure, the amount of bonus payable will be capped by the 
level of attainment on the adjusted EBIT metric. Corporate Governance

Base salary Andy Blundell – £364,212 
Steve Rawlins – £250,000
A further review will occur on 1 July 2018.
Pension No changes to the overall value of the pension arrangements for Executive Directors are anticipated for 2018. From 
1 July 2013 the pension entitlement for each Executive Director has been set at 12% of base salary.
Benefits There are no proposed changes to the benefits offered to Executive Directors in 2018.
The benefits to be received by Executive Directors in 2018 will include life assurance, private medical cover, car or 
car allowance provision and fuel card.
Annual performance bonus The maximum annual performance bonus for 2018 will remain at 100% of base salary.
The proposed performance measures (and their respective weightings) for the 2018 annual bonus are as follows:
• Adjusted EBIT – 50%
• Free cash flow – 25%
• Personal objectives – 25%
The actual performance targets for 2018 are not disclosed prospectively as these are considered to be 
commercially sensitive by the Board. The Committee’s intention is for the performance targets for each 
performance measure to be disclosed retrospectively in next year’s Directors’ Remuneration Report, which is 
consistent with the fact the performance targets for the 2017 annual performance bonus are disclosed 
retrospectively in this report on page 48.
As described in the Annual Statement from the Chair of the Remuneration Committee, reflecting the level of stretch 
within the targets set for the 2018 annual bonus, the percentage of maximum bonus payable for on-target 
performance in 2018 will be 65% of base salary.
Long-term incentives There will be an LTIP grant made in 2018 to the Executive Directors over shares worth 150% of salary. 
The performance conditions for this award will be as follows:
• 50% of the award will be subject to a performance condition requiring absolute growth in adjusted diluted EPS; 
• 50% of the award will be subject to a performance condition requiring absolute growth in TSR;
• for both metrics, the vesting range is detailed below;
• both metrics will be measured over three financial years to 31 December 2020;
• EPS will be measured on the basis of adjusted diluted EPS; and
• TSR growth will be measured using a three-month averaging period to determine the starting and ending 
TSR levels.

the measurement date of 14 April 2018. The table assumes that 44.053% of the total award vests. This is multiplied by the three-month average share price to 31 December 2017 
(59.3426p per share). Corporate Governance

8  The aggregate remuneration of all Directors under salary, fees, benefits, cash contributions in lieu of pensions and annual bonus was £1,114,000 (2016 £1,447,000) 
(2016 figures included remuneration details for Nigel Howes and Dave Rushton, who are no longer remunerated).
9   Dave Rushton stepped down from the Board on 31 January 2016 and ceased to be an employee on 30 June 2016.  He was paid salary, benefits and pension entitlement until 30 
June 2016 only in accordance with his contractual notice period.  As noted above, he was paid an additional £8,622 in 2016 with regard to settlement of claims in relation to 
statutory rights.  He did not receive an annual bonus for 2016.  Dave Rushton exercised his outstanding LTIP options on 13 September 2016 (14,453 shares at 39.08p).
10  Nigel Howes stepped down from the Board on 31 January 2016 and ceased to be an employee on 31 January 2017. He was paid salary, benefits and supplement in lieu of pension 
until 31 January 2017 only in accordance with his contractual notice period.  He was paid an additional £5,700 in January 2017 with regard to settlement of claims in relation to 
statutory rights.  He did not receive an annual bonus for 2016.  Nigel Howes exercised his outstanding LTIP options on 19 March 2017 (222,049 shares at 54.25p). 
ANNUAL PERFORMANCE BONUS 2017
As Mark Stoner stood down from the Board on 4 December 2017, it was determined that he would not receive an annual performance 
bonus for 2017. 
The performance measures for the 2017 annual performance bonus were as follows:
• adjusted EBIT (50% weighting of total bonus);
• free cash flow (25% weighting of total bonus); and
• personal objectives (25% weighting of total bonus).
Level: Threshold Maximum
T otal value of award available: 30% of weighting 100% of weighting
Weighting: Metric:
50% of salary Adjusted EBIT (£’m) 20.5 22.6
25% of salary Free cash flow (£’m) 12 14
25% of salary Personal objectives — —
Against these measures, £21.2m was achieved for adjusted EBIT and £12.5m was achieved for free cash flow.
On the basis of the Committee’s judgement and considering performance against the performance measures described above, the 
2017 annual bonus for Andy Blundell was £109,000 (2016 £89,000), an outcome of 30% of salary. Andy Blundell accepted the bonus 
in line with other members of the Executive Board.
VESTING OF LTIP AWARDS IN 2018
The 2015 LTIP award was based as to 20% of the award on a share price growth performance condition and as to 80% of the award on 
an EPS performance condition. See page 51 for a summary of the performance conditions.
The share price growth performance condition requires the attainment of share price growth thresholds (65.513p to 90p) on the third 
anniversary of the award date (being 14 April 2018). Accordingly, the single figure table includes an estimated level of vesting for these 
awards based on the three-month average share price to 31 December 2017 (59.3426p; estimated vesting nil).
The EPS performance condition of CAGR 7.5% to 15% has been achieved as to 55.066% vesting. 
In the single total figure table 44.053% of the total 2015 LTIP award is represented as vesting.
PENSION ENTITLEMENTS SUMMARY
Andy Blundell remains a member of the defined contribution section of the Communisis Pension Plan. He receives a contribution of 
£10,000 per annum to the Communisis Pension Plan. His overall pension entitlement is 12% of base salary. The balance above £10,000 
is paid as a salary supplement. No Director participated in a defined benefit scheme in the year.  Steve Rawlins will receive all pension 
entitlements as a cash supplement. Corporate Governance

NOTES
1   Profit distributed by way of dividend has been taken as the dividend paid in respect of the relevant financial year. For 2017 this is the 
interim dividend paid (£1,860,000) and the proposed final dividend of £3,704,000. No share buy-backs were made in either year.
2  Overall expenditure on pay has been taken as the total employee costs (wages and salaries, social security costs and pension 
costs) as set out in Note 5.3 Employee Benefits Expense in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
The reduction in the percentage of spend on pay primarily reflects the lower number of employees in the Group in 2017.

1  EPS is adjusted basic earnings per share (i.e. earnings per share from continuing operations before exceptional items 
and amortisation of acquired intangibles and the tax effect of these items). Vesting is based on EPS for the final year of the 
three-year performance period.
2  Both absolute TSR and share price are measured on the basis of three-month averaging periods.

PROVISION OF SHARES FOR SHARE PLANS – DILUTION
The current estimated dilution from subsisting awards, including executive and all-employee share awards, and assuming, which is most 
unlikely, that all subsisting options vest in full, is approximately 4.36% of the shares in issue at the date of this report. The Company has an 
Employee Benefit Trust which as at 7 March 2018 holds 441,220 shares which may be used to satisfy options granted under the 
Executive Share Option Scheme and the LTIP and the above estimate of potential dilution is presented on the basis of assuming that the 
Employee Benefit Trust will satisfy certain outstanding awards. Awards are currently managed to confine commitments within an overall 
dilution limit for all-employee share plans of no more than 10% of share capital in any 10-year period and a limit of 5% of share capital in 
any 10-year period for the Company’s discretionary share plans. Following approval of the 2017 LTIP by shareholders at the 2017 AGM, 
the 5% limit in respect of the Company’s discretionary share plans will no longer apply to new LTIP awards.

DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION POLICY 
REMUNERATION POLICY
Remuneration for Executive Directors comprises the following elements:
FIXED PAY VARIABLE PAY
TOTAL 
REMUNERATION
Base salary + Pension + Benefits + Annual performance bonus + Long-term incentives =
Element and purpose Policy Operation and opportunity Performance measures
Base salary
This is the core element of pay 
that reflects the individual’s role 
and position within the Group 
and reflects capability and 
contribution.
Base salaries are reviewed 
periodically against companies 
of similar size and complexity, 
and any salary increases are 
applied in line with the outcome 
of the relevant review with effect 
from 1 July in a financial year. 
Base salaries are paid monthly 
in cash.
Any salary increases in the policy 
period will be made following 
consideration of business 
performance and, as a cap, no 
increase will take an Executive 
Director’s salary above the 
median salary for Chief 
Executives in the FTSE SmallCap 
plus 10%, determined using data 
available to the Committee at 
that time.
N/A
Pension
To provide market-competitive 
levels of retirement benefits.
Provide a competitive 
employer-sponsored pension plan.
Pension contributions are paid in 
relation to membership of the 
defined contribution section of 
the Communisis Pension Plan, as 
a salary supplement in lieu of 
pension contributions, or as a 
Company contribution to 
personal pension arrangements.
Pension contributions are set at 
a maximum level of 12% of base 
salary per annum.
N/A
Benefits
To aid retention and remain 
competitive within the 
marketplace.
Benefits comprise private 
medical cover, car or car 
allowance provision and 
fuel card.
The Committee reserves the 
ability to introduce new benefits 
where it concludes that it is in the 
interests of Communisis to do so, 
having regard to the particular 
circumstances and to market 
practice, provided that the 
maximum aggregate value of all 
benefits in a year will not exceed 
the maximum amount stated in 
this table.
In any year the values of benefits 
for Executive Directors may vary 
in line with the cost of providing 
insurance and other benefits 
without the Committee 
taking action.
A limit on the maximum cash 
value of all benefits has been set 
at £40,000 per annum for each 
Executive Director. Actual levels 
of benefits will be disclosed each 
year in the “single figure” table.
N/A Corporate Governance
54 Communisis plc  Annual Report and Financial Statements 2017
DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION REPORT CONTINUED
Element and purpose Policy Operation and opportunity Performance measures
Annual performance bonus
To motivate employees and 
incentivise delivery of annual 
performance targets.
Bonus levels and the 
appropriateness of measures 
are reviewed annually at the 
commencement of each 
financial year to ensure they 
continue to support our strategy.
Once set, performance 
measures and targets will 
generally remain unchanged for 
the year, except to reflect events 
such as corporate acquisitions 
or other major transactions 
where the Committee considers 
it to be necessary, in its opinion, 
to make appropriate adjustments.
The Committee will not set a 
maximum annual bonus level in 
excess of 100% of base salary for 
the duration of this policy.
Awards are paid in cash.
No bonus is paid at the threshold 
level of performance, with amounts 
accruing from that point.
The performance measures applied 
may be financial or non-financial, 
and can be corporate, divisional 
or individual measures set for any 
year in such proportions as the 
Committee considers appropriate. 
However, the weighting of financial 
performance measures will not be 
reduced below 60% of total annual 
bonus potential in any year for the 
duration of this policy.
The Committee will consider overall 
Group and financial performance 
before any element of bonus is paid, 
and accordingly may moderate the 
bonus outturn either upwards 
(without exceeding the 100% of base 
salary cap) or downwards.
Long-term incentives
The Company operates the 
Communisis Long Term Incentive 
Plan 2017 (LTIP) to motivate and 
incentivise delivery of sustained 
performance over the long term.
Awards can be made on an 
annual basis with a vesting 
period of at least three years.
The Company also has scope to 
operate a tax-advantaged 
Executive Share Option Scheme. 
Although there is no plan to 
make awards to Executive 
Directors under this plan at 
present, the Company reserves 
the right to do so subject to the 
£30,000 limit on HMRC 
approved options available 
under this plan. Any such awards 
would be taken into account in 
making any awards under the 
LTIP in the same year.
The maximum value of LTIP 
awards which may be granted in 
any financial year is equivalent 
to 150% of base salary.
The threshold level of vesting for 
LTIP awards will not exceed 25% 
of the total award.
Performance measures applied to 
LTIP awards are reviewed from time 
to time to ensure they remain 
appropriate and aligned with 
shareholders’ interests.
The Committee may set such 
performance conditions on LTIP 
awards as it considers appropriate 
(whether financial or non-financial 
and whether corporate, divisional or 
individual). However, performance 
conditions will always measure 
performance over a period of at 
least three financial years 
(commencing with the financial year 
in which the award is made).
Share ownership guidelines
To encourage share ownership 
by the Executive Directors and 
ensure interests are aligned.
Executive Directors are expected 
to retain 50% of all shares (net of 
tax) which vest under the LTIP (or 
any other discretionary 
long-term incentive 
arrangement introduced in the 
future) until such time as they 
hold a specified value of shares.
Only beneficially owned shares 
and vested share awards 
(discounted for anticipated tax 
liabilities) may be counted for 
the purposes of the guidelines. 
Share awards do not count prior 
to vesting.
The Remuneration Committee 
will review Executive Director 
shareholdings annually in the 
context of this policy.
100% of base salary for all 
Executive Directors.

All-employee share plans
To encourage share ownership 
by employees, thereby allowing 
them to share in the long-term 
success of the Group and align 
their interests with those of the 
shareholders.
The Company operates a 
Sharesave plan for UK 
employees.
This is an all-employee 
tax-advantaged share plan and 
follows the usual form for such 
plans.
Executive Directors are able to 
participate in all-employee share 
plans on the same terms as 
other Group employees.
The exercise price of the options 
is usually equal to the market 
price of the shares at the date of 
invitation to participate less a 
maximum discount of 20%.
The maximum amount that can 
be invested in the scheme will 
not exceed the statutory limit 
from time to time (currently 
£500 per month).
The options vest on the third 
or fifth anniversary of the 
commencement of the savings 
period (depending upon the 
length of the savings period).
Consistent with normal practice, 
such awards are not subject to 
performance conditions.

Directors are determined by the 
Board. The Chairman’s fee is 
determined by the Committee.
Non-executive Directors will not 
participate in share incentive 
arrangements.
Fees are paid monthly in cash.
The aggregate fees (and any 
benefits) of the Chairman and 
Non-executive Directors will not 
exceed the limit from time to time 
prescribed within the Company’s 
Articles of Association for such fees

N/A
NOTES TO THE REMUNERATION POLICY TABLE
1. Differences between the Policy on Remuneration for Directors from the Policy on Remuneration of other employees
Where Communisis’ pay policy for Directors differs to its pay policies for groups of employees, this reflects the appropriate market rate 
position for the relevant roles. However, elements of consistency of treatment are promoted through a single Group-wide annual 
bonus arrangement (although quantum and the mix of performance metrics vary according to seniority) and Group-wide share plans.
2. Stating maximum amounts for the remuneration policy
The DRR Regulations and related investor guidance encourages companies to disclose a cap within which each element of 
remuneration policy will operate. Where maximum amounts for elements of remuneration have been set within the Directors’ 
Remuneration Policy, these will operate simply as caps and are not indicative of any aspiration.
3. Malus and clawback
Malus (being the forfeiture of unvested awards) and clawback (being the ability of the Company to claim repayment of paid amounts 
as a debt) provisions apply to the annual bonus and LTIP. These provisions may be applied where the Remuneration Committee 
considers it appropriate to do so following:
• any material re-statement of the Company’s or a Group member’s financial results for any period;
• individual gross misconduct; or
• any other circumstances that have a sufficiently significant impact on the reputation of the Company or any Group member.
4. Travel and hospitality
While the Remuneration Committee does not consider it to form part of benefits in the normal usage of that term, it has been advised 
that corporate hospitality (whether paid for by Communisis or another) and certain instances of business travel (including any related 
tax liabilities settled by the Company) for the Directors (and exceptionally their family members) may technically come within the 
applicable rules and so the Remuneration Committee expressly reserves the right to authorise such activities within its agreed policies. Corporate Governance

5. Payments under previous policies
For the avoidance of doubt, in approving this Directors’ Remuneration Policy, authority is given to the Remuneration Committee to 
honour any commitments entered into with former or current Directors under previous policies (including the payment of pensions 
and the vesting of past share awards).
6. Discretions reserved in operating incentive plans
The Remuneration Committee will operate the annual performance bonus and LTIP according to their respective rules and the above 
Remuneration Policy table. The Remuneration Committee retains certain discretions, consistent with market practice, in relation to the 
operation and administration of these plans including:
• the determination of performance measures and targets and resultant vesting and pay-out levels;
• the ability to adjust performance measures and targets to reflect events (including corporate actions) and/or to ensure the 
performance measures and targets operate as originally intended;
• (as described in the Termination Policy section below) determination of the treatment of individuals who leave employment, based 
on the rules of the incentive plans, and the treatment of the incentive plans on exceptional events, such as a change of control of the 
Company; and
• the ability to make adjustments to existing awards made under the incentive plans in certain circumstances (e.g. rights issues, 
corporate restructurings or special dividends).
APPROACH TO RECRUITMENT REMUNERATION
The Company’s recruitment remuneration policy aims to give the Committee sufficient flexibility to secure the appointment and 
promotion of high-calibre executives to strengthen the management team and secure the skill sets to deliver our strategic aims.
The following represents principles to be applied by the Committee on recruitment of Executive Directors:
• The starting point for the Committee will be to look to the policy for 
Executive Directors as set out in the policy table and structure a 
package in accordance with that policy. Consistent with the DRR 
Regulations, the caps contained within the general policy for fixed 
pay will not apply to a recruit although the Committee would not 
envisage exceeding those caps in practice.
• For a new appointment, base salary may be increased over time 
following progress and development in the role rather than being set 
directly at the level of a previous incumbent or at market level.
• For an internal appointment, any variable pay element awarded in 
respect of the prior role may either continue on its original terms or 
be adjusted to reflect the new appointment, as appropriate.
• For external and internal appointments, the Committee may agree 
that the Company will make a contribution towards legal fees in 
connection with agreeing employment terms.
• The annual performance bonus plan and LTIP will operate as 
outlined in the general policy in relation to any newly appointed 
Executive Director, including the maximum award levels.
• All awards for external appointments to compensate for awards 
forfeited on leaving a previous employer (“buy-outs”), whether made 
under the annual performance bonus, LTIP or otherwise (including 
under UKLA Listing Rule 9.4.2), will be capped at the commercial 
value of the amount forfeited and will take account of the nature, 
time horizons and performance requirements of those awards. 
In particular, the Committee’s starting point will be to ensure that 
any awards being forfeited which remain subject to outstanding 
performance requirements (other than where substantially complete) 
will be replaced with buy-out awards subject to similar requirements, 
and any awards with service requirements are also bought out with 
similar terms. However, exceptionally the Committee may relax those 
obligations in respect of buy-outs where it considers it to be in the 
interests of shareholders and those factors are, in the view of the 
Committee, equally reflected in some other way, for example through 
a discount to the face value of the awards forfeited.
• For the avoidance of doubt, such buy-out awards are not subject 
to a formal cap.
A new Chairman or Non-executive Director would be recruited on the terms explained above in respect of the main policy for such Directors. Corporate Governance
57 Communisis plc  Annual Report and Financial Statements 2017
SERVICE CONTRACTS
EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
The Committee’s policy is that each Executive Director’s service agreement should be of indefinite duration, subject to termination at 
normal retirement age, and should otherwise be terminable by the Company on no more than 12 months’ notice and by the Director on 
six months’ notice. The service agreements of all Executive Directors comply with that policy. None of the service agreements include 
provision for compensation payments on early termination. Whether any such compensation would be payable and the amount of any 
compensation would be determined according to the law of contract as it applies to the particular circumstances of an individual case. 
Contracts do not contain change of control provisions. The Committee reserves flexibility to alter these principles if necessary to secure 
the recruitment of an appropriate candidate but would expect a return to these principles within a reasonable timeframe.
The date of each Executive Director’s appointment is:
Contract date
Andy Blundell 2 November 2009
Steve Rawlins 4 December 2017
NON-EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
Each Non-executive Director is engaged for an initial period of three years. They are then invited to serve for a further three-year 
period, after which they are appointed annually. These engagements can be terminated by either party on three months’ notice.
The Non-executive Directors cannot participate in the Company’s share option schemes, are not entitled to any pension benefit and 
are not entitled to any payment in compensation for early termination of their appointment.
The date of original appointment of each Non-executive Director and the effective date of their latest appointment is:
Date of original appointment Latest appointment date
David Gilbertson 1 March 2017 1 March 2017
Jane Griffiths 17 May 2012 7 May 2015
Peter Harris 1 July 2013 12 May 2016
Helen Keays 1 August 2014 11 May 2017
TERMINATION POLICY SUMMARY
It is appropriate for the Committee to consider treatments on a termination having regard to all of the relevant facts and 
circumstances available at that time. This policy applies both to any negotiations linked to notice periods on a termination and any 
treatments that the Committee may choose to apply under the discretions available to it under the terms of the annual performance 
bonus and LTIP plans. The potential treatments on termination under these plans are summarised below.
Incentives If a leaver is deemed to be a 
“good leaver”; i.e. leaving through 
voluntary redundancy, serious ill 
health or death or otherwise at 
the discretion of the Committee.
If a leaver is deemed to be 
a “bad leaver”; i.e. leaving 
for disciplinary reasons or 
to join a competitor.
Other exceptional cases; 
e.g. change in control.
Annual Performance Bonus Committee has discretion to award a 
pro-rated bonus.
No awards made. Pro-rated bonus.
Long Term Incentive Plan (LTIP)* Leaver will receive a pro-rated award 
subject to the application of the 
performance conditions. Vesting levels 
may be varied by the Committee if 
considered appropriate. Vesting will 
not be brought forward to the time of 
cessation of employment unless the 
Committee considers this appropriate.
All awards will normally lapse. Leaver will receive a pro-rated award 
subject to the application of the 
performance conditions at the date 
of the event, subject to standard 
Committee discretions to increase 
vesting taking into account relevant 
factors.
* Similar treatments would apply to any awards made under the Executive Share Option Scheme in future. Corporate Governance

APPENDIX TO DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION REPORT –  
DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION POLICY CONTINUED
TERMINATION POLICY SUMMARY CONTINUED
The Company has power to enter into settlement agreements with executives and to pay compensation to settle potential legal 
claims. In addition, and consistent with market practice, in the event of termination of an Executive Director, the Company may pay a 
contribution towards the individual’s legal fees and fees for outplacement services as part of a negotiated settlement. Any such fees 
would be disclosed as part of the detail of termination arrangements. For the avoidance of doubt, the policy does not include an 
explicit cap on the cost of termination payments.
In the event of cessation of a Non-executive Director’s appointment they would be entitled to a three-months’ notice period.
EXTERNAL APPOINTMENTS
Andy Blundell is a Non-executive Director of RM plc. No other Executive Director is a director of any company apart from subsidiaries of 
Communisis. Were any Executive Directors to take up such an external non-executive appointment, they would be permitted to retain 
any fees earned from that appointment.

Pay and employment conditions in the Group are taken into account when setting Executive Directors’ remuneration. The Committee 
receives regular updates from the Human Resources Director on overall pay and conditions in the Group, including (but not limited to) 
changes in base pay and any staff bonus pools in operation. There is also oversight of the all-employee Sharesave Scheme which 
Executive Directors and all other Group employees can participate in on the same terms and conditions.
The Company did not consult with employees in drawing up this Directors’ Remuneration Report.

renewed annually at the Company’s AGM.
No share buy-backs were undertaken by the Company during 
2017. In March and November 2016 the Communisis plc Employee 
Benefit Trust acquired 320,000 and 800,000 shares respectively 
for total consideration of £441,691.

CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY
The Group’s approach to corporate social responsibility 
is detailed within its report set out on pages 26 to 32.
POLITICAL DONATIONS
No political expenditure was incurred during the year, nor were 
any contributions made for political purposes.
EMPLOYMENT POLICY
Communisis is committed to the principle of equal employment 
opportunity for all employees and to providing employees with 
a work environment free of discrimination and harassment.
Employment decisions at Communisis are based on candidates’ 
abilities to match the business needs, job requirements and 
individual qualifications for roles. We are committed to treating 
all candidates in a fair and objective manner, regardless of their 
age, race, colour, nationality, ethnic origin, creed, disability, 
sexual orientation, sex, gender identity, marital or civil 
partnership status, parental status, religion, belief or non-belief, 
social or economic class, employment status, or any other 
criteria that cannot be shown to be properly justifiable.
RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT
Expenditure on research and development in the year was £nil 
(2016 £nil).
In respect of internal development activities, in 2017, we 
continued active development across Connect
TM
, our multi-
channel communication platform.
A key challenge for clients in marketing wishing to adopt any 
type of workflow system is the definition of their own processes. 
To simplify this, within Mantl
TM
 (the marketing workflow 
components of Connect
TM
) we have developed new standard 
processes for many types of workflow such as Direct Marketing 
and Product Literature. The initial release of these features 
helped us reduce on-boarding for the first client down to eight 
weeks where previously it was between three and six months.
For retail customers ensuring their point of sale material is 
displayed correctly is a major challenge. Our current compliance 
tool enables retail stores to photograph their displays and central 
marketing can then approve, or provide instructions to correct the 
displays. We have been researching image analysis and 
recognition to do this automatically. Proof of concept work 
suggests that walls with up to three posters on may be 
recognisable but beyond that the resolution of the posters 
becomes too small. There is a trade-off between how quickly 
multiple items can be confirmed as correct and verifying each 
item, particularly when the change between versions may be low.
Like all organisations we are moving away from developing 
applications to building multi-tenanted platforms and in 2017 we 
updated Connect
TM
 to enable multiple clients to run on a single 
infrastructure stack. Over time this will enable us to deliver more 
integrated support with the ability to centrally monitor the 
production, delivery and receipt of communications.
We launched two new products within the Connect
TM
 range, 
firstly Personalised Video is now a channel option for marketing 
and transactional customers. Personalised Video, as the name 
suggests, enables an email to be sent to customers containing a 
link to a video with content tailored to them. 
We have also developed DocBox as a solution to long-term storage 
of terms and conditions in a digital form. Many of our clients are 
required by the regulator to provide documentation in a so called 
“Durable Medium”, one that cannot be tampered with and will be 
available to the customer for the relevant regulatory period. 
DocBox provides a unique encrypted URL for each document, plus 
underlying storage that enables clients to prove that each 
customer is being served the correct terms and conditions for the 
product they have and also that the document has not been 
changed since it was posted. DocBox saved our initial client over 
£1m in postage costs for terms and conditions mailings. Corporate Governance

indemnity provision within the meaning of Section 236 of the Act.
The Company also takes out insurance covering claims against 
the Directors or officers of the Company and any subsidiary. This

AUDITOR
The Directors will place a resolution before the AGM to re-
appoint Ernst & Young LLP as auditor for the ensuing year.
Approved by the Board on 8 March 2018 and signed on its 
behalf by:
Sarah Caddy
Company Secretary
8 March 2018
The Notice of Meeting specifies deadlines for exercising voting 
rights either in person or by proxy in relation to resolutions to be 
passed at that meeting. All votes, including proxy votes, will be 
counted and made available as soon as practicable after the 
AGM and published on the Company’s website.
There are no restrictions on the transfer of ordinary shares in the 
Company other than:
• the registration of share transfers may be suspended at such 
times and for such periods (not exceeding 30 days in any year) 
as the Directors may determine;
• certain restrictions may, from time to time, be imposed by laws 
and regulations (for example, insider trading laws and market 
requirements relating to close periods); and
• the restrictions imposed by the Listing Rules of the Financial 
Conduct Authority, whereby certain employees of the 
Company require the approval of the Company to deal in the 
Company’s securities.
A special resolution at a general meeting of the shareholders is 
required to amend the Company’s Articles of Association.
Directors are re-appointed by ordinary resolution at a general 
meeting of the shareholders. The Articles provide that the Board 
can appoint a Director but anyone so appointed must be elected 
by an ordinary resolution at the next AGM. At each AGM, 
one-third of the Directors previously elected at an AGM must 
retire by rotation. Each retiring Director who wishes to continue 
to serve must be re-elected at the meeting. In line with best 
practice, the Board conducts annual re-elections for all Directors 
and will follow this policy at the 2018 AGM.
DIRECTORS’ AUTHORITIES
The Directors are authorised under the terms of Section 551 of the 
Act to issue ordinary shares up to a maximum aggregate 
nominal value of £17,448,000 and under the terms of Section 560 
of the Act authorised to issue ordinary shares in connection with 
a rights issue up to a maximum aggregate nominal value of 
£34,896,001 (such amount to be reduced by any allotments 
made under the first part of this paragraph). Pursuant to Section 
570 of the Act, the Directors are also authorised to allot shares for 
cash, without first offering them to existing shareholders, up to a 
limit of 5% of the Company’s issued ordinary share capital. This 
authority also gives the Directors the power to allot shares for 
cash in connection with a rights issue.
Both these authorities will expire at the AGM on 10 May 2018, and 
the Directors will seek to have them renewed at that meeting. Corporate Governance

STATEMENT OF DIRECTORS’ RESPONSIBILITIES
PARENT COMPANY FINANCIAL STATEMENTS PREPARED 
UNDER UK GAAP
The Directors are responsible for preparing the parent company 
Financial Statements in accordance with applicable United 
Kingdom law and regulations.
Company law requires the Directors to prepare Financial 
Statements for each financial year. Under that law, the Directors 
have elected to prepare the Financial Statements in accordance 
with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice 
(United Kingdom Accounting Standards and applicable law). 
Under company law, the Directors must not approve the 
Financial Statements unless they are satisfied that they give 
a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Company 
and of the profit and loss of the Company for that period.
In preparing these Financial Statements, the Directors are 
required to:
• select suitable accounting policies and then apply 
them consistently;
• make judgements and estimates that are reasonable 
and prudent;
• state whether applicable UK accounting standards have been 
followed, subject to any material departures disclosed and 
explained in the Financial Statements; and
• prepare the Financial Statements on a going concern basis 
unless they consider that to be inappropriate.
The Directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting 
records that are sufficient to show and explain the Company’s 
transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy, at any time, 
the financial position of the Company and enable them to ensure 
that the Financial Statements comply with the Companies Act 
2006. They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of 
the Company and hence for taking reasonable steps for the 
prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.
GROUP FINANCIAL STATEMENTS PREPARED UNDER IFRS
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report 
and Financial Statements in accordance with applicable law and 
regulations.
Company law requires the Directors to prepare Financial 
Statements for each financial year. Under that law, the Directors 
have prepared the Group Financial Statements in accordance 
with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted 
by the European Union (EU). Under company law, the Directors 
must not approve the Financial Statements unless they are satisfied 
that they give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the 
Group and of the profit or loss of the Group for that period.
In preparing these Financial Statements, the Directors are 
required to:
• select suitable accounting policies and apply them 
consistently;
• make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and 
prudent;
• state whether IFRS as adopted by the EU has been followed, 
subject to any material departures disclosed and explained in 
the Group Financial Statements; and
• prepare the Financial Statements on a going concern basis 
unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Group will 
continue in business.
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting 
records, which show and explain the Group’s transactions and 
disclose with reasonable accuracy, at any time, the financial 
position of the Group and enable them to ensure that the 
Financial Statements comply with the Companies Act 2006 and 
Article 4 of the International Accounting Standards (IAS) 
Regulation. They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets 
of the Group and hence for taking reasonable steps for the 
prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.
The Directors are also responsible for preparing the Directors’ 
Report, the Strategic Report, the Directors’ Remuneration Report 
and the Corporate Governance Report in accordance with the 
Companies Act 2006 and applicable regulations, including the 
requirements of the Listing Rules and the Disclosure and 
Transparency Rules. Corporate Governance

auditor’s report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone 
other than the company and the company’s members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed. 
CONCLUSIONS RELATING TO PRINCIPAL RISKS, GOING CONCERN AND VIABILITY STATEMENT
We have nothing to report in respect of the following information in the annual report, in relation to which the ISAs (UK) require us to 
report to you whether we have anything material to add or draw attention to:
• the disclosures in the annual report set out on pages 18 to 21  that describe the principal risks and explain how they are being managed 
or mitigated;
• the directors’ confirmation set out on page 18 in the annual report that they have carried out a robust assessment of the principal 
risks facing the entity, including those that would threaten its business model, future performance, solvency or liquidity;
• the directors’ statement set out on page 18 in the financial statements about whether they considered it appropriate to adopt the 
going concern basis of accounting in preparing them, and their identification of any material uncertainties to the entity’s ability 
to continue to do so over a period of at least twelve months from the date of approval of the financial statements;
• whether the directors’ statement in relation to going concern required under the Listing Rules in accordance with Listing Rule 
9.8.6R(3) is materially inconsistent with our knowledge obtained in the audit; or 
• the directors’ explanation set out on page 18 in the annual report as to how they have assessed the prospects of the entity, over 
what period they have done so and why they consider that period to be appropriate, and their statement as to whether they have 
a reasonable expectation that the entity will be able to continue in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due over the period 
of their assessment, including any related disclosures drawing attention to any necessary qualifications or assumptions.

OVERVIEW OF OUR AUDIT APPROACH
Key audit matters • Revenue recognition
• Carrying value of goodwill
Audit scope • We performed an audit of the complete financial information of 5 components and audit procedures on 
specific balances for the remaining 17 components.
• The components where we performed full or specific audit procedures accounted for >99.5% of profit before 
tax adjusted for exceptional items, >99.5% of Revenue and 99% of Total assets.
Materiality • Overall Group materiality of £0.8m which represents 5% of profit before tax adjusted for exceptional items.*
* Exceptional items are defined in note 5.4 to the Annual Report and Financial Statements
KEY AUDIT MATTERS 
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement, were of most significance in our audit of the financial 
statements of the current period and include the most significant assessed risks of material misstatement (whether or not due to 
fraud) that we identified. These matters included those which had the greatest effect on: the overall audit strategy, the allocation of 
resources in the audit; and directing the efforts of the engagement team. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit 
of the financial statements as a whole, and in our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.
Risk Our response to the risk
Key observations communicated to 
the Audit Committee 
Revenue recognition 
Refer to the Audit Committee Report (pages 42 
and 43); and Notes 2 and 4 of the Group 
financial statements 
The Group has reported revenues of £375.9m 
(2016 £361.9m). We identified 4 specific risks 
of fraud and error in respect of improper 
revenue recognition given the nature of the 
Group’s products and services as follows:
• Inappropriate cut-off of revenue;
• Inappropriate accounting for complex 
contractual arrangements; 
• Inappropriate accrual or deferral 
of income;
• Management bias or override of controls.
There is no change in the risk profile in the 
current year.
At each full and specific scope audit location with 
significant revenue streams:
• We performed walkthroughs of each significant class 
of revenue transactions and assessed the design 
effectiveness of key controls. 
• For revenue recognised close to the period end, we 
vouched all transactions above our testing threshold 
to documentation supporting recognition of revenue.
• For revenue accrued but unbilled at the period end, we 
vouched all transactions above our testing threshold 
to documentation supporting recognition of revenue 
on a stage of completion basis.
• We have performed audit procedures over a sample of 
complex contractual arrangements and assessed 
whether the revenue recognition policies adopted were 
appropriate and consistently applied.
• We performed other substantive, transactional testing 
and analytical procedures to assess the recognition of 
revenue throughout the year. Where practicable, at 9 
components we performed testing over full 
populations of transactions using data analysis.
• For revenue recorded through journal entries outside of 
normal business processes, we performed testing on a 
sample basis to establish whether a service had been 
provided or a sale had occurred in the financial year 
to support the revenue recognised
We also considered the adequacy of the Group’s 
disclosure of accounting policies for revenue recognition 
in notes 2 and 4 to the financial statements respectively.
At each full and specific scope audit location with 
significant revenue streams (12 components) we 
performed audit procedures which covered >99.5% 
of the Group’s revenue. All procedures were performed 
by the primary team
Based on the 
procedures performed, 
we did not identify any 
evidence of material 
misstatement in the 
revenue recognised 
in the year or 
revenue deferred at 
31 December 2017. Financial Statements

KEY AUDIT MATTERS CONTINUED
Risk Our response to the risk
Key observations communicated to 
the Audit Committee 
Carrying value of goodwill
Refer to the Audit Committee Report (pages 42 
and 43); and Notes 2 and 12 of the Group 
financial statements
We focused on this area due the size of the 
goodwill balance (£164m) (2016 £164m) and 
because the directors’ assessment of ‘value 
in use’ of the Group’s Cash Generating Units 
(“CGUs”) involves assumptions about the 
future performance of the business and 
the discount rates applied to future cash 
flow forecasts.
We consider there to be a fraud risk due to 
the significance of the carrying value of 
goodwill; the inherent judgements involved; 
and recent trading challenges in some 
jurisdictions where the Group operates 
making the estimate susceptible to override 
by management.
There is no change in the risk profile in the 
current year.
We challenged management’s assumptions used in its 
impairment models for assessing the recoverability of the 
carrying value of goodwill. We focused on the 
appropriateness of CGU identification, the method 
applied to estimate recoverable values, discount rates, 
and forecast cash flows. Specifically:
• We assessed the design effectiveness of internal financial 
controls over management’s budgeting process and their 
assessment and measurement of impairment. 
• We have confirmed that the CGUs identified are the 
lowest level at which management monitors goodwill.
• We tested the method applied in the value in use 
calculation as compared to the requirements of IAS 36, 
Impairment of Assets, and the mathematical accuracy 
and integrity of management’s model.
• We obtained an understanding of, and assessed the basis 
for, key underlying assumptions for the 2018 budget. 
• We have confirmed that the cash flow forecasts used in 
the valuation are consistent with information approved 
by the Board and have reviewed the historical accuracy 
of management’s forecasts.
• We challenged management on its cash flow forecasts 
and the implied growth rates for 2018 and beyond by 
considering evidence available to support these 
assumptions and their consistency with findings from 
other areas of our audit.
• The discount rates and long term growth rates applied 
within the model were assessed in conjunction with EY 
valuation specialists, including comparison to 
economic and industry forecasts where appropriate.
• For both CGUs, we performed sensitivity analyses 
by stress testing key assumptions in the model with 
downside scenarios to understand the parameters 
that, should they arise, could lead to a different 
conclusion in respect of the carrying value of goodwill.
We considered the appropriateness of the related 
disclosures provided in note 12 in the Group financial 
statements.
The entire goodwill balance was subject to full scope 
audit procedures.
Based on the results 
of our work, we agree 
with management’s 
conclusion that no 
impairment of goodwill 
is required in the current 
year. We agree with 
management’s 
assessment of the 
reasonably possible 
changes in key 
assumptions that would 
result in an impairment 
in any Cash Generating 
Unit and the disclosure 
given in note 12 to the 
financial statements.
In the prior year, our auditor’s report included a key audit matter in relation to ‘Accounting for a change in segments’. As the 
reportable segments have not changed in 2017 this has not been included this year.  Financial Statements
69 Communisis plc  Annual Report and Financial Statements 2017
AN OVERVIEW OF THE SCOPE OF OUR AUDIT 
TAILORING THE SCOPE
Our assessment of audit risk, our evaluation of materiality and our allocation of performance materiality determine our audit scope 
for each entity within the Group. Taken together, this enables us to form an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. We take 
into account size, risk profile, the organisation of the Group and effectiveness of Group-wide controls, changes in the business environment 
and other factors such as recent Internal audit results when assessing the level of work to be performed at each entity.
In assessing the risk of material misstatement to the Group financial statements, and to ensure we had adequate quantitative 
coverage of significant accounts in the financial statements, of the 22 reporting components of the Group, we selected 12 components 
covering entities within Europe which represent the principal business units within the Group.
Of the 12 components selected, we performed an audit of the complete financial information of 5 components (“full scope 
components”) which were selected based on their size or risk characteristics. For the remaining 7 components (“specific scope 
components”), we performed audit procedures on specific accounts within that component that we considered had the potential 
for the greatest impact on the significant accounts in the financial statements either because of the size of these accounts or their 
risk profile. 
The reporting components where we performed audit procedures accounted for 100% (2016 100%) of the Group’s Profit before tax 
adjusted for exceptional items, 100% (2016 100%) of the Group’s Revenue and 100% (2016 100%) of the Group’s Total assets. For the 
current year, the full scope components contributed 95% (2016 96%) of the Group’s Profit before tax adjusted for exceptional items, 94% 
(2016 94%) of the Group’s Revenue and 94% (2016 94%) of the Group’s Total assets. The specific scope components contributed 4% 
(2016 4%) of the Group’s Profit before tax adjusted for exceptional items, 5% (2016 6%) of the Group’s Revenue and 5% (2016 5%) of the 
Group’s Total assets. The audit scope of these components may not have included testing of all significant accounts of the component 
but will have contributed to the coverage of significant accounts tested for the Group. 
Of the remaining 10 components that together represent 1% of the Group’s Profit before tax adjusted for exceptional items, none are 
individually greater than 1% of the Group’s Profit before tax adjusted for exceptional items. For these components, we performed other 
procedures, including analytical review, testing of consolidation journals and intercompany eliminations to respond to any potential 
risks of material misstatement to the Group financial statements.

INVOLVEMENT WITH COMPONENT TEAMS 
In establishing our overall approach to the Group audit, we determined the type of work that needed to be undertaken at each of the 
components by us as the primary audit team.
All audit work performed for the purposes of the audit of the Group Financial Statements was undertaken by the primary audit team.  Financial Statements

INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT TO THE MEMBERS OF COMMUNISIS PLC CONTINUED
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2017
OUR APPLICATION OF MATERIALITY 
We apply the concept of materiality in planning and performing the audit, in evaluating the effect of identified misstatements on the 
audit and in forming our audit opinion. 
MATERIALITY
The magnitude of an omission or misstatement that, individually or in the aggregate, could reasonably be expected to influence the economic 
decisions of the users of the financial statements. Materiality provides a basis for determining the nature and extent of our audit procedures.
We determined materiality for the Group to be £800,000 (2016 £780,000), which is 5% (2016 5%) of the Group’s adjusted profit before 
tax. We believe that adjusted profit before tax provides us with a consistent year on year basis for determining materiality and is the 
most relevant performance measure to the stakeholders of the entity. Non-recurring items are set out in Note 5.4 of the Group’s 
financial statements. 
We determined materiality for the Parent Company to be £1.7 million (2016 £1.5 million), which is 2% (2016 2%) of net assets. This is higher 
than Group materiality of £800,000, however for the purpose of the Group audit, we performed our work using allocated 
performance materiality of £120,000.
STARTING BASIS
• Profit before tax £14.4m
ADJUSTMENTS
• Adjustment for non recurring items
• Exceptional items of £2.1m
MATERIALITY
• Profit before tax adjusted for exceptional items of £16.5m
• Materiality of £800,000 (5% of materiality basis)
During the course of our audit, we reassessed initial materiality and the only change in the final materiality from our original 
assessment at planning was to reflect the actual reported performance of the Group in the year.
PERFORMANCE MATERIALITY
The application of materiality at the individual account or balance level. It is set at an amount to reduce to an appropriately low level the 
probability that the aggregate of uncorrected and undetected misstatements exceeds materiality.
On the basis of our risk assessments, together with our assessment of the Group’s overall control environment, our judgement 
was that performance materiality was 50% (2016 75%) of our planning materiality, namely £400,000 (2016 £580,000). We have set 
performance materiality at this percentage to ensure that uncorrected and undetected misstatements in all accounts do not exceed 
our materiality level. We have set performance materiality at this percentage due to our past experience of the audit that indicate a 
higher risk of misstatements, both corrected and uncorrected.
Audit work at component locations for the purpose of obtaining audit coverage over significant financial statement accounts is 
undertaken based on a percentage of total performance materiality. The performance materiality set for each component is based 
on the relative scale and risk of the component to the Group as a whole and our assessment of the risk of misstatement at that 
component. In the current year, the range of performance materiality allocated to full and specific scope components was £80,000 
to £240,000 (2016 £117,000 to £350,000). 
REPORTING THRESHOLD
An amount below which identified misstatements are considered as being clearly trivial.
We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to them all uncorrected audit differences in excess of £40,000 (2016 £39,000), 
which is set at 5% of planning materiality, as well as differences below that threshold that, in our view, warranted reporting on 
qualitative grounds. 
We evaluate any uncorrected misstatements against both the quantitative measures of materiality discussed above and in light 
of other relevant qualitative considerations in forming our opinion. Financial Statements

OTHER INFORMATION 
The other information comprises the information included in the annual report set out on pages 1 to 65, other than the financial 
statements and our auditor’s report thereon. The directors are responsible for the other information.
Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and, except to the extent otherwise explicitly stated in 
this report, we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon. 
In connection with our audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider 
whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit or 
otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If we identify such material inconsistencies or apparent material misstatements, we 
are required to determine whether there is a material misstatement in the financial statements or a material misstatement of the other 
information. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of the other information, 
we are required to report that fact.
We have nothing to report in this regard.
In this context, we also have nothing to report in regard to our responsibility to specifically address the following items in the other 
information and to report as uncorrected material misstatements of the other information where we conclude that those items meet 
the following conditions:
• Fair, balanced and understandable set out on page 65 – the statement given by the Directors that they consider the annual report 
and financial statements taken as a whole is fair, balanced and understandable and provides the information necessary for 
shareholders to assess the Group’s performance, business model and strategy, is materially inconsistent with our knowledge 
obtained in the audit; or 
• Audit committee report set out on page 42 – the section describing the work of the audit committee does not appropriately 
address matters communicated by us to the audit committee; or
• Directors’ statement of compliance with the UK Corporate Governance Code set out on page 36 – the parts of the directors’ 
statement required under the Listing Rules relating to the company’s compliance with the UK Corporate Governance Code 
containing provisions specified for review by the auditor in accordance with Listing Rule 9.8.10R(2) do not properly disclose a 
departure from a relevant provision of the UK Corporate Governance Code.
OPINIONS ON OTHER MATTERS PRESCRIBED BY THE COMPANIES ACT 2006
In our opinion, the part of the directors’ remuneration report to be audited has been properly prepared in accordance with the 
Companies Act 2006.
In our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of the audit:
• the information given in the strategic report and the directors’ report for the financial year for which the financial statements are 
prepared is consistent with the financial statements; and 
• the strategic report and the directors’ report have been prepared in accordance with applicable legal requirements.
MATTERS ON WHICH WE ARE REQUIRED TO REPORT BY EXCEPTION
In the light of the knowledge and understanding of the Group and the parent company and its environment obtained in the course 
of the audit, we have not identified material misstatements in the strategic report or the directors’ report.
We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters in relation to which the Companies Act 2006 requires us to report to you 
if, in our opinion:
• adequate accounting records have not been kept by the parent company, or returns adequate for our audit have not been received 
from branches not visited by us; or
• the parent company financial statements and the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited are not in agreement 
with the accounting records and returns; or
• certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration specified by law are not made; or
• we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit. Financial Statements

INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT TO THE MEMBERS OF COMMUNISIS PLC CONTINUED
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2017
RESPONSIBILITIES OF DIRECTORS
As explained more fully in the directors’ responsibilities statement set out on pages 64 and 65, the directors are responsible for the 
preparation of the financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view, and for such internal control as the 
directors determine is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether 
due to fraud or error. 
In preparing the financial statements, the directors are responsible for assessing the Group and parent company’s ability to continue 
as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting 
unless the directors either intend to liquidate the Group or the parent company or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative 
but to do so.
AUDITOR’S RESPONSIBILITIES FOR THE AUDIT OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material 
misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a 
high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs (UK) will always detect a material 
misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, 
they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements. 
EXPLANATION AS TO WHAT EXTENT THE AUDIT WAS CONSIDERED CAPABLE OF DETECTING IRREGULARITIES, 
INCLUDING FRAUD 
The objectives of our audit, in respect to fraud, are: to identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements 
due to fraud; to obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the assessed risks of material misstatement due to fraud, 
through designing and implementing appropriate responses; and to respond appropriately to fraud or suspected fraud identified 
during the audit. However, the primary responsibility for the prevention and detection of fraud rests with both those charged with 
governance of the entity and management. 
Our approach was as follows: 
• We obtained an understanding of the legal and regulatory frameworks that are applicable to the Group and determined that the 
most significant frameworks which are directly relevant to specific assertions in the financial statements are those that relate to the 
reporting framework (IFRS, FRS 101, the Companies Act 2006 and UK Corporate Governance Code) and the relevant tax compliance 
regulations in the jurisdictions in which the Group operates.
• We understood how Communisis plc is complying with those frameworks by making enquiries of management, Internal Audit, those 
responsible for legal and compliance procedures and the Company Secretary. We corroborated our enquiries through our review of 
board minutes and papers provided to the Audit Committee.
• We assessed the susceptibility of the Group’s financial statements to material misstatement, including how fraud might occur, by 
meeting with management from various parts of the business to understand where it considered there was a susceptibility to fraud. 
We also considered performance targets and their propensity to influence efforts made by management to manage earnings. We 
considered the programmes and controls that the Group has established to address risks identified, or that otherwise prevent, deter 
and detect fraud; and how senior management monitors those programmes and controls. Where the risk was considered to be 
higher, we performed audit procedures to address each identified fraud risk. These procedures included testing manual journals 
and were designed to provide reasonable assurance that the financial statements were free from fraud and error.
Based on this understanding we designed our audit procedures to identify non-compliance with such laws and regulations identified 
in the paragraphs above. Our procedures involved journal entry testing, with a focus on manual consolidation journals, and journals 
indicating large or unusual transactions based on our understanding of the business; enquiries of Legal Counsel, Group management, 
Internal Audit, subsidiary Management at all full and specific scope components; and focused testing, as referred to in the key audit 
matters section above. In addition, we completed procedures to conclude on the compliance of the disclosures in the Annual Report 
and Accounts with the requirements of the relevant accounting standards, UK legislation and the UK Corporate Governance Code 2016.
A further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements is located on the Financial Reporting Council’s 
website at https://www.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities. This description forms part of our auditor’s report. Financial Statements
73 Communisis plc  Annual Report and Financial Statements 2017
OTHER MATTERS WE ARE REQUIRED TO ADDRESS 
• We were appointed by the company on 11 October 2002 to audit the financial statements for the year ending 31 December 2002 and 
subsequent financial periods.  
• The period of total uninterrupted engagement including previous renewals and reappointments is 16 years, covering the years 
ending 2002 to 2017.
• The non-audit services prohibited by the FRC’s Ethical Standard were not provided to the Group or the parent company and we 
remain independent of the Group and the parent company in conducting the audit. 
• The audit opinion is consistent with the additional report to the audit committee.

CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF CHANGES IN EQUITY
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2017 Financial Statements
79 Communisis plc  Annual Report and Financial Statements 2017
1. AUTHORISATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
The Consolidated Financial Statements of Communisis plc (the “Group”) for the year ended 31 December 2017 were authorised for issue 
in accordance with a resolution of the Directors on 8 March 2018. Communisis plc is a public limited company incorporated and 
domiciled in England and Wales whose shares are traded on the London Stock Exchange. The registered office is located at 
Communisis House, Manston Lane, Leeds LS15 8AH. The nature of the Group’s operations and its principal activities are set out in the 
Chief Executive’s Statement on pages 12 to 15.
2. ACCOUNTING POLICIES 
2.1 BASIS OF PREPARATION 
The Consolidated Financial Statements of Communisis plc are for the year ended 31 December 2017. They have been prepared in 
accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted by the European Union. 
The Consolidated Financial Statements are presented in Sterling and all values are rounded to the nearest thousand British pounds 
(£000) except where otherwise indicated. 
New standards and interpretations 
There are no IFRS or IFRIC (IFRS Interpretations Committee of the IASB) interpretations effective for the first time this financial year that 
have had a material impact on the Group. The Group has not early adopted any standards, interpretations or amendments that have 
been issued but are not yet effective. 
2.2 BASIS OF CONSOLIDATION 
The Consolidated Financial Statements comprise the Financial Statements of Communisis plc and its subsidiaries as at 31 December 
each year. The results of subsidiaries prepared for the same reporting year as the parent company are included in these Consolidated 
Financial Statements, using consistent accounting policies. All intra-group balances and transactions, including unrealised profits 
arising from intra-group transactions, have been eliminated in full. 
Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the Group and cease to be consolidated from the 
date on which control is transferred out of the Group. Where there is a change of control of a subsidiary, the Consolidated Financial 
Statements include the results for the part of the reporting year during which Communisis plc has control. 
2.3 SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING JUDGEMENTS AND ESTIMATES 
The key judgements and assumptions concerning the future and other key sources of estimation uncertainty at the Balance Sheet date 
that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial 
year are discussed below. 
Judgements 
Exceptionals
The Group presents separately, on the face of the Income Statement, material items of income and expense which, because of the 
nature and expected infrequency of the events giving rise to them, merit separate presentation to allow shareholders to understand 
better the elements of financial performance in the year. An element of management judgement is required in identifying these 
exceptional items. Additional information is included in Note 5.4.
Development costs
Expenditure on a development project, such as computer software, which is reliably measurable, is capitalised when the technical 
feasibility and commercial viability of the project is demonstrated. The Group must intend to, and have available the resources to, 
complete the project and be satisfied that the intangible asset arising from the development project will generate probable future 
economic benefits. An element of management judgement is required when distinguishing between the research and development 
phases of a project. Additional information is included in Note 5.3. 
Estimates 
Impairment of goodwill 
The Group determines whether goodwill is impaired on at least an annual basis. This requires an estimation of the value in use of the 
cash-generating units to which the goodwill is allocated. Estimating the value in use requires the Group to make an estimate of the 
expected future cash flows from the cash-generating unit and also to choose a suitable discount rate in order to calculate the present 
value of those cash flows. The carrying amount of goodwill at 31 December 2017 was £164m (2016 £164m). Additional information is 
included in Note 12.

2. ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED
2.3 SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING JUDGEMENTS AND ESTIMATES CONTINUED 
Pensions 
The actuarial valuation involves making assumptions about mortality rates and future pension increases. Due to the long-term nature 
of these plans, such estimates are subject to significant uncertainty. Discount rates are based on interest rates of AA rated corporate 
bonds that have terms of maturity approximating to the terms of the relevant pension liability. Additional information is included in 
Note 14. 
Revenue recognition
Revenue from the delivery of client projects is recognised by reference to the stage of completion. This is more commonly seen within 
the “agency” businesses. Stage of completion is estimated using an appropriate measure according to the nature of the contract such 
as costs incurred relative to total anticipated costs. Where the financial outcome of a project cannot be reliably measured, revenue is 
only recognised to the extent that the expenses recognised are recoverable.
2.4 SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES 
Foreign currency transactions 
Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded in the functional currency at the rate ruling at the date of the transaction. Monetary 
assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rate of exchange ruling at the Balance Sheet date and 
exchange differences arising are recognised in the Income Statement. 
The functional currencies of the overseas subsidiaries include the Euro, the Indian Rupee, the Swedish Krona, the Swiss Franc, the 
Turkish Lira, the Polish Zloty, the Romanian Leu, the United Arab Emirates Dirham and the United States Dollar. The assets and 
liabilities of these overseas subsidiaries are translated into Sterling at the rate of exchange ruling at the Balance Sheet date and their 
Income Statements are translated at the weighted average exchange rates for the year where this is a reasonable approximation to 
actual translation rates. The exchange differences arising on the retranslation are taken directly to a separate component of equity 
described as the “cumulative translation adjustment”. On disposal of a foreign entity, the cumulative amount recognised in equity 
relating to that particular foreign operation is recognised in the Income Statement.
Property, plant and equipment 
Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment in value. Land is not depreciated.
Depreciation is calculated on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the asset as follows:
Freehold property 25 to 50 years 
Long leasehold property 25 to 50 years
Short leasehold property 5 to 20 years
Plant, equipment and motor vehicles 3 to 20 years
The carrying values of property, plant and equipment are reviewed for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate 
the carrying value may not be recoverable. If any such indication exists, and where the carrying values exceed the estimated 
recoverable amount, the assets are written down to their recoverable amount. The recoverable amount of property, plant and 
equipment is the greater of fair value less costs to sell and value in use. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are 
discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money 
and the risks specific to the asset. Useful economic lives, depreciation methods and residual values are reviewed annually. For an asset 
that does not generate largely independent cash inflows, the recoverable amount is determined for the cash-generating unit to which 
the asset belongs. Impairment losses are recognised in the Income Statement.
Business combinations
Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method. The cost of an acquisition is measured as the aggregate of 
the consideration transferred, measured at acquisition date fair value. Acquisition costs incurred are expensed and included in 
exceptional items.
When the Group acquires a business, it assesses the financial assets and liabilities assumed for appropriate classification and 
designation in accordance with the contractual terms, economic circumstances and pertinent conditions as at the acquisition date. 
Assets acquired and liabilities assumed in transactions separate to the business combinations, such as the settlement of pre-existing 
relationships or post-acquisition remuneration arrangements, are accounted for separately from the business combination in 
accordance with their nature and applicable IFRSs.
Any contingent consideration to be transferred by the acquirer will be recognised at fair value at the acquisition date. Subsequent 
changes to the fair value of the contingent consideration which is deemed to be an asset or a liability will be recognised in accordance 
with IAS 39 either in profit or loss or as a change to other comprehensive income. If the contingent consideration is classed as equity, it 
is not remeasured until it is finally settled within equity. Financial Statements
81 Communisis plc  Annual Report and Financial Statements 2017
2. ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED
2.4 SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED
Goodwill
Goodwill on acquisitions is initially measured at cost, being the excess of the cost of the business combination over the acquirer’s 
interest in the net fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities. Following initial recognition, goodwill is 
measured at cost less any accumulated impairment losses. Goodwill is not amortised. 
Goodwill is reviewed for impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that its carrying value 
may be impaired. Goodwill is allocated to the related cash-generating units monitored by management for the purpose of 
impairment testing. 
Where goodwill has been allocated to a cash-generating unit (or group of cash-generating units) and an operation within that unit 
(or group of units) is disposed of, the goodwill associated with the operation disposed of is included in the carrying amount of the 
operation when determining the gain or loss on disposal of the operation. Goodwill disposed of in this circumstance is measured 
based on the relative values of the operations disposed of and the portion of the cash-generating unit (or group of units) retained.
Intangible assets
Intangible assets are carried at cost less accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses. Intangible assets created 
within the business are not capitalised (unless the specific conditions in IAS 38 are met) and expenditure is charged to the Income 
Statement in the year in which the expenditure is incurred. 
(a) Acquired from a business combination
Intangible assets arising from a business combination are capitalised at fair value at the date of acquisition, where they can be 
measured reliably. Following initial recognition, the cost model is applied to the class of intangible assets. Amortisation charged on 
assets is recognised in amortisation expense in the Income Statement over the expected life of the asset. Intangible assets currently 
recognised are being amortised over a period of between five and ten years.
(b) Customer relationships
Amounts paid to secure customer contracts are capitalised and amortised over the length of the contract. An impairment review is 
carried out when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable.
(c) Research and development costs 
Research costs are expensed as incurred. Expenditure on a development project, such as computer software, which is reliably 
measurable, is capitalised when the technical feasibility and commercial viability of the project is demonstrated. The Group must 
intend to, and have available the resources to, complete the project and be satisfied that the intangible asset arising from the 
development project will generate probable future economic benefits. 
Following the initial recognition of the development expenditure, the cost model is applied requiring the asset to be carried at cost less 
any accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses. Any expenditure carried forward is amortised over the period of 
expected future sales from the related project, from the date the asset is available for use. 
The carrying value of development costs is reviewed when there is an indicator of impairment. In addition it is reviewed annually when 
the asset is not yet in use. 
(d) Computer software costs 
Acquired computer software and licences are capitalised. These costs are amortised over their estimated useful lives (three to eight years). 
Costs associated with maintaining computer software programs are recognised as an expense as incurred. Costs that are directly 
associated with the production of identifiable and unique software products controlled by the Group, and that will generate probable 
economic benefits exceeding costs beyond one year, are recognised as intangible assets. Direct costs include the costs of software 
development employees. These costs are amortised over their estimated useful lives (three to eight years). 
Useful lives are also examined on an annual basis and adjustments, where applicable, are made on a prospective basis. 
Inventories 
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. 
Raw materials are stated at purchase cost on a first-in, first-out basis. For finished goods and work in progress, costs include directly 
attributable material and labour costs and certain overhead costs that contribute in bringing the inventories to their present location 
and condition. Selling expenses and other administrative overhead expenses are excluded. 
Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less estimated costs of completion and the 
estimated costs necessary to make the sale. 
Provision is made for items of stock that are damaged, obsolete or slow moving.  Financial Statements

2. ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED
2.4 SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED
Trade and other receivables 
Trade and other receivables are recognised and carried at original invoice amount less an allowance for any uncollectable amounts. 
An estimate for doubtful debts is made. Bad debts are written off when identified. 
Impairment of assets 
At each reporting date, the Group assesses whether there is any indication that an asset may be impaired. Where an indicator of 
impairment exists, the Group makes a formal estimate of recoverable amount. Where the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its 
recoverable amount, the asset is considered impaired and is written down to its recoverable amount. Recoverable amount is the 
higher of an asset or cash-generating unit’s fair value less costs to sell and its value in use. Recoverable amount is determined for an 
individual asset, unless the asset does not generate cash inflows that are largely independent of those from other assets or groups of 
assets, in which case impairment is determined at the cash-generating unit level. The carrying amounts of the cash-generating units 
to which goodwill is allocated and intangible assets not yet available for use are reviewed annually or more frequently when there is 
an indication of impairment. 
Value in use is determined by the estimated future pre-tax cash flows, discounted to their present values using a pre-tax discount rate 
that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risk specific to the asset. 
Cash and cash equivalents 
Cash and cash equivalents in the Consolidated Balance Sheet comprise cash at bank and in hand and short-term deposits with an 
original maturity of three months or less. 
For the purpose of the Consolidated Cash Flow Statement, cash and cash equivalents are as defined above, net of outstanding 
bank overdrafts. 
Trade and other payables 
Trade and other payables are recognised and carried at original invoice amount. 
Financial instruments 
Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised in the Consolidated Balance Sheet when the Group becomes a party to the 
contractual provisions of the instrument. 
Financial liabilities 
The Group’s financial liabilities include borrowings and trade and other payables, which are all classified as “other financial liabilities”. 
Other financial liabilities are initially measured at fair value, net of transaction costs. Other financial liabilities are subsequently 
measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, with interest expense recognised on an effective yield basis. The 
effective interest method is a method of calculating the amortised cost of a financial liability and of allocating interest expense over 
the relevant period. The effective interest rate is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash payments through the expected 
life of the financial liability, or, where appropriate, a shorter period.
Derecognition of financial liabilities 
The Group derecognises financial liabilities when, and only when, the Group’s obligations are discharged, cancelled, or they expire.
Derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting
Initial recognition and subsequent measurement 
The Group uses derivative financial instruments such as forward currency contracts and interest rate swaps to hedge its foreign 
currency and interest rate risks respectively. Such derivative financial instruments are initially recognised at fair value on the date on 
which a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently remeasured at fair value. Derivatives are carried as financial assets 
when the fair value is positive and as financial liabilities when the fair value is negative.
Any gains or losses arising from changes in fair value on derivatives during the year that do not qualify for hedge accounting and the 
ineffective portion of an effective hedge are taken directly to the Income Statement.
The fair value of forward currency contracts is the difference between the forward exchange rate and the contract rate. The forward 
exchange rate is referenced to current forward exchange rates for contracts with similar maturity profiles. 
The fair value of interest rate swaps is the difference between the fixed rate and the one-month LIBOR rate implied at the Balance 
Sheet date, calculated monthly, and discounted to present value.
For the purpose of hedge accounting, hedges are classified as cash flow hedges when hedging exposure to variability in cash flows, 
which is either attributable to a particular risk associated with a recognised asset or liability or a highly probable forecast transaction, 
or when hedging the foreign currency risk in an unrecognised firm commitment. Financial Statements
83 Communisis plc  Annual Report and Financial Statements 2017
2. ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED
2.4 SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED
Derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting continued
Initial recognition and subsequent measurement continued
For those derivatives designated as hedges and for which hedge accounting is desired, the hedging relationship is formally designated 
and documented at its inception. This documentation identifies the risk management objective and strategy for undertaking the 
hedge, the hedging instrument, the hedged item or transaction, the nature of the risk being hedged and how effectiveness will be 
measured throughout its duration. Such hedges are expected to be highly effective in offsetting changes in fair value or cash flows 
and are assessed on an ongoing basis to determine that they actually have been highly effective throughout the financial reporting 
periods for which they were designated.
Cash flow hedges 
The effective portion of the gain or loss on the hedging instrument is recognised in other comprehensive income, while any ineffective 
portion is recognised immediately in the Income Statement.
Amounts taken to equity are transferred to the Income Statement when the hedged transaction affects profit or loss, such as when the 
hedged financial income or financial expense is recognised or when a forecast sale occurs. Where the hedged item is the cost of a 
non-financial asset or non-financial liability, the amounts taken to other comprehensive income are transferred to the initial carrying 
amount of the non-financial asset or liability.
If the forecast transaction or firm commitment is no longer expected to occur, amounts previously recognised in equity are transferred 
to the Income Statement. If the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised without replacement or rollover, or if its 
designation as a hedge is revoked, amounts previously recognised in equity remain in other comprehensive income until the forecast 
transaction or firm commitment occurs.
The Group sometimes uses forward exchange contracts as hedges of its exposure to foreign currency risk in forecasted transactions 
and firm commitments. During 2017 and 2016 the Group did not utilise any hedging instruments other than in respect of interest rates 
as detailed in Note 23.
Provisions
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past event, it is probable that 
an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate can be made, 
but there is some uncertainty about the timing or the amount of the future expenditure required in settlement. If the effect of the time 
value of money is material, provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at a pre-tax rate that reflects 
current market assessments of the time value of money and, where appropriate, the risks specific to the liability. Where discounting is 
used, the increase in the provision due to the passage of time is recognised as a finance cost. 
Pensions and similar obligations
Group companies operate defined contribution and defined benefit pension plans.
Payments to the defined contribution pension plans are charged as an expense to the Income Statement as incurred when the related 
employee service is rendered. The Group has no further legal or constructive payment obligations once the contributions have been made.
For the defined benefit pension plan, the cost of administering the pension scheme is recognised in employee benefits expense in the 
Income Statement. The Group determines the net interest income/expense on the net defined benefit assets/liabilities for the year by 
applying the discount rates used to measure the defined benefit obligations at the beginning of the year to the net defined benefit 
assets/liabilities at the beginning of the year, taking into account any changes in the net defined benefit assets/liabilities during the 
year as a result of contributions and benefit payments. The liability recognised in the Balance Sheet in respect of the defined benefit 
pension plan is the present value of the defined benefit obligation at the Balance Sheet date less the fair value of the plan assets. The 
defined benefit obligation is calculated annually by independent actuaries. The present value of the defined benefit obligation is 
determined by discounting the estimated future cash outflows using interest rates of AA rated corporate bonds that have terms of 
maturity approximating to the terms of the relevant pension liability. AA rated corporate bonds are used as the most suitable proxy for 
calculating the discount rate. 
All actuarial gains and losses that arise in calculating the present value of the defined benefit obligation and the fair value of plan 
assets are recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income. 
When a settlement or a curtailment occurs, the obligation and the related plan assets are remeasured using current actuarial 
assumptions and the resultant gain or loss is recognised in the Income Statement during the period in which the settlement or 
curtailment occurs. A settlement is the elimination of all obligations for benefits already accrued and a curtailment is the reduction of 
future obligations as a result of a material reduction in the scheme membership or a reduction in future entitlement.  Financial Statements

2.4 SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED
Share-based payment transactions 
Certain Directors and management are eligible to participate in share-based payment schemes, all of which are equity-settled. 
The cost of equity-settled transactions with employees is measured by reference to their fair value at the date at which they are granted. 
The fair value is determined by an external valuer using an appropriate model. In valuing equity-settled transactions, no account is 
taken of any vesting conditions, other than conditions linked to the price of the shares of Communisis plc (“market conditions”). 
The cost of equity-settled transactions is recognised, together with a corresponding increase in equity, over the period in which the 
performance or service conditions are fulfilled, ending on the date on which the relevant employees become fully entitled to the award 
(“the vesting date”). The cumulative expense recognised for equity-settled transactions at each reporting date reflects the extent to 
which the vesting period has expired and the Group’s best estimate of the number of equity instruments that will ultimately vest. 
No expense is recognised for awards that do not ultimately vest, except for awards where vesting or non-vesting is conditional upon a 
market condition, which are treated as vesting irrespective of whether or not the market condition is satisfied, provided that all other 
performance or service conditions are satisfied. 
The Group has an employee share ownership plan (ESOP) for the granting of non-transferable options. Shares in the Group held by the 
ESOP are accounted for in the same way as treasury shares and presented in the Balance Sheet as a deduction from equity described 
as the “ESOP reserve”. 
Where an equity-settled award is cancelled, it is treated as if it had vested on the date of cancellation, and any cost not yet recognised 
in the Income Statement for the award is expensed immediately. This includes any awards where non-vesting conditions within the 
control of the Group or the employee are not met. Any compensation paid up to the fair value of the award at the cancellation or 
settlement date is deducted from equity, with any excess over fair value being treated as an expense in the Income Statement. 
Where an equity-settled award is forfeited, the total cost recognised in the Income Statement to date for the award is reversed. 
ESOP reserve 
Communisis plc shares held by the Group are classified in shareholders’ equity as the “ESOP reserve” and are recognised at cost. 
Consideration received for the sale of such shares is also recognised in equity, with any difference between the proceeds from sale and 
the original cost being taken to retained earnings. No gain or loss is recognised in the Income Statement on the purchase, sale, issue or 
cancellation of equity shares. 
Leases 
The determination of whether an arrangement is, or contains, a lease is based on the substance of the arrangement at the inception 
date. The determination considers whether fulfilment of the arrangement is dependent on the use of a specific asset or assets, or the 
arrangement conveys a right to use the assets. 
Finance leases, which transfer to the Group substantially all the risks and benefits incidental to ownership of the leased item, are 
capitalised at the commencement of the lease at the fair value of the leased asset or, if lower, at the present value of the minimum 
lease payments. Lease payments are apportioned between finance charges and reduction of the lease liability on a straight-line basis. 
Finance charges are recognised in the Income Statement. 
Leased assets are depreciated over the useful life of the asset. However, if there is no reasonable certainty that the Group will obtain 
ownership by the end of the lease term, the asset is depreciated over the shorter of the estimated useful life of the asset and the lease term.
Operating lease payments are recognised as an expense in the Income Statement on a straight-line basis over the lease term or in 
accordance with utilisation of the leased asset when the contract is based on usage.
Revenue 
Revenue in the year represents the turnover, net of discounts, derived from services provided to clients and sales of goods.
Revenue is recognised at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable to the extent that it is probable that the economic 
benefits will flow to the Group and the revenue can be reliably measured. The following specific recognition criteria must also be met 
before revenue is recognised:
Provision of services 
The provision of print sourcing services includes the sourcing and supply of printed and other marketing material (included within 
Brand Deployment revenue). Revenue from such services is recognised when the significant risks and rewards of ownership of the 
material have passed to the client and the amount of revenue can be measured reliably; this is usually on despatch by the supplier.
Revenue from creative, data and analysis services (included within Customer Experience revenue) is recognised when the service has 
been provided and client acknowledgement of stage completion has been received. 
Revenue from campaign management services (included within Brand Deployment revenue) is recognised when the service has been 
provided, on a time basis which is either a monthly or annual charge, or on a management fee basis. Financial Statements

2. ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED
2.4 SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED
Revenue continued
Provision of services continued
Revenue from delivery of client projects is recognised by reference to the stage of completion. Stage of completion is estimated using 
an appropriate measure according to the nature of the contract such as costs incurred relative to total anticipated costs or other 
measures such as contract milestone completion. Where the project outcome cannot be measured reliably, revenue is recognised only 
to the extent of the expenses recognised that are recoverable.
Revenue from postal sortation services (included within Customer Experience revenue) is recognised on despatch of the post to the 
postal carrier.
Revenue from software licences is recognised over the period of the licence.
Sale of goods 
Revenue is recognised when the significant risks and rewards of ownership of the goods have passed to the buyer and the amount of 
revenue can be measured reliably; this is usually on despatch by the Group. 
Interest 
Finance revenue is recognised as the interest accrues using the effective interest method, which is the rate that exactly discounts 
estimated future cash receipts through the expected life of the financial instrument to the net carrying amount.
Income from suppliers 
The Group receives rebates from certain suppliers for transactions that, based on the terms of the relevant contracts and local law, are 
either remitted to clients or retained by the Group. If amounts are passed on to clients they are recorded as liabilities until settled or, if 
retained by the Group, are recorded as a reduction to cost of sales as earned. These rebates are not complex in nature and there is no 
management judgement in calculating these. The rebates are typically calculated based on a fixed percentage of purchase value.
Exceptional items 
The Group presents separately , on the face of the Income Statement, those material items of income and expense which, because of the nature 
and expected infrequency of the events giving rise to them, merit separate presentation to allow shareholders to understand better the elements 
of financial performance in the year . This facilitates comparison with prior periods and to better assess trends in financial performance.
Income tax
Current tax 
Current tax assets and liabilities for the current year are measured at the amount expected to be recovered from or paid to the 
taxation authorities. The tax rates and tax laws used to compute the amount are those that are enacted or substantively enacted by 
the Balance Sheet date.
Deferred tax 
Deferred income tax is provided, using the liability method, on all temporary differences at the Balance Sheet date between the tax 
bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts for financial reporting purposes.
Deferred income tax liabilities are recognised for all taxable temporary differences except in respect of taxable temporary differences 
associated with investments in subsidiaries, where the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences can be controlled and it is 
probable that the temporary differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary differences arise from the initial recognition of goodwill, or from 
the initial recognition (other than in a business combination) of other assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the 
taxable profit nor the accounting profit.
Deferred income tax assets are recognised for all deductible temporary differences, carry-forward of unused tax assets and unused 
tax losses, to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which the deductible temporary differences and 
the carry-forward of unused tax assets and unused tax losses can be utilised. In respect of deductible temporary differences associated 
with investments in subsidiaries, deferred tax assets are only recognised to the extent that it is probable that the temporary differences 
will reverse in the foreseeable future and taxable profit will be available against which the temporary differences can be utilised. 
The carrying amount of deferred income tax assets is reviewed at each Balance Sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no 
longer probable that sufficient taxable profit will be available to allow all or part of the deferred income tax asset to be utilised. 
Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply to the year when the asset is realised 
or the liability is settled, based on tax rates (and tax laws) that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the Balance Sheet date. 
Income tax relating to items recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity is also recognised in other comprehensive 
income or directly in equity.  Financial Statements

2.4 SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED
Sales tax 
Revenues, expenses and assets are recognised net of the amount of sales tax except: 
• where the sales tax incurred on a purchase of goods and services is not recoverable from the taxation authority, in which case the 
sales tax is recognised as part of the cost of acquisition of the asset or as part of the expense item as applicable; and 
• receivables and payables which are stated with the amount of sales tax included. 
The net amount of sales tax recoverable from, or payable to, the taxation authority is included as part of receivables or payables in 
the Balance Sheet. 
Dividend distribution 
The final dividend distribution to the Company’s shareholders is recognised as a liability in the Group’s Financial Statements in the year 
in which the dividend is approved by the Company’s shareholders. Interim dividends are recognised in the year in which they are paid. 
2.5 ADOPTION OF NEW AND REVISED STANDARDS 
The IASB and IFRIC have issued a number of standards and interpretations with an effective date after 1 January 2018. With the 
exception of the new revenue standard IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers (effective 1 January 2018 replacing IAS 18 
Revenue) and the new leases standard IFRS 16 Leases (effective 1 January 2019 replacing IAS 17 Leases), the Directors do not anticipate 
that the adoption of these standards and interpretations will have a material impact on the Group’s Financial Statements.
IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers
The standard replaces IAS 18 Revenue, IAS 11 Construction Contracts and related interpretations. It provides a single comprehensive 
model to use in accounting for revenue and costs from contracts with customers and includes extensive disclosure requirements. The 
core principle is that an entity recognises revenue at an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled 
to in exchange for transferring the goods or services to a customer. The principles in IFRS 15 are applied using the five-step model.
The Group will adopt IFRS 15 using the full retrospective application method and consequently apply the new standard to each 
reporting period presented i.e. 2017, in accordance with IAS 8 Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors. 
As a practical expedient under IFRS 15 the Group will apply the five step approach to portfolios of contracts with similar characteristics 
as it is not expected that the Financial Statements would materially differ had the standard been applied to the individual contracts 
within the portfolio. In addition the following practical expedients will also be taken:
• contracts which are completed at the beginning of the earliest period presented will not be restated;
• contracts that are started and completed in the same annual reporting period will have no impact and therefore will not be restated;
• where contracts are completed but had variable consideration, an entity will use the transaction price at the date the contract was 
completed rather than estimates of the variable consideration in comparative periods;
• contract modifications which occurred before the beginning of the earliest period presented will be reflected in aggregate; and
• for all periods presented before the date of initial application, we will not disclose the amount of the transaction price allocated to 
the remaining performance obligations or an explanation of when we expect to recognise that amount as revenue.
The Group is in the process of finalising the impact on the 2017 results. At this stage, the following areas of change have been 
identified:
• certain revenue streams within the Customer Experience segment should be treated on an Agent basis under IFRS 15 whereas under 
IAS 18 these are accounted for on a Principal basis. As Agent, the Group will recognise revenue net (i.e. the remaining amount of 
consideration after deduction of third party’s fees) when or as the performance obligation is satisfied. An adjustment to both 
revenue and costs is therefore required when restating the 2017 comparatives in accordance with IFRS 15. This will not affect profit 
however margins will be improved due to the lower revenue figures; and
• the profile of transition revenue, relating to the integration of new contracts into Communisis, is likely to change under IFRS 15. 
The extent of this change will vary between contracts dependent on the specifics of each individual transition project. 
IFRS 16 Leases
The standard replaces IAS 17 Leases and related interpretations. It introduces a single lessee accounting model, referred to as the 
“right-of-use” model, which will apply to most leases. The standard therefore primarily changes operating lease accounting for 
lessees. All lease arrangements will give rise to the recognition of a right-of-use asset and a lease liability. Lease costs will be 
recognised in the form of deprecation of the right-of-use asset and interest on the lease liability. Lessee accounting under IFRS 16 
is therefore similar to accounting for finance leases under existing IAS 17. Lessor accounting under IFRS 16 is similar to existing IAS 17 
accounting and is not expected to have a material impact for the Group. Financial Statements
87 Communisis plc  Annual Report and Financial Statements 2017
2. ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED
2.5 ADOPTION OF NEW AND REVISED STANDARDS CONTINUED 
IFRS 16 Leases continued 
The Group is currently assessing and quantifying the impact of the accounting changes that will arise under IFRS 16; however, the 
following changes to lessee accounting will have a material impact on the Consolidated Income Statement, Consolidated Balance 
Sheet and Consolidated Cash Flow Statement after the Group’s adoption on 1 January 2019:
• right-of-use assets will be recognised for most assets that are leased by the Group under operating leases; currently no lease assets 
are recognised on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The biggest asset category impacted for the Group will be Land and Buildings;
• liabilities will be recorded for future lease payments of existing operating leases in the Consolidated Balance Sheet for the 
“reasonable certain” period of the lease. Liabilities are not currently recorded for operating leases; future operating lease 
commitments are however disclosed. The lease liability recognised on transition will not equal the lease commitments reported 
on 31 December 2017, but may not be dissimilar. This increase in debt will have an impact on gearing ratios;
• lease expenses will be for depreciation of the right-of-use assets and interest on lease liabilities. Interest will typically be higher in 
the early stages of a lease and reduce over the term as with current finance lease accounting under existing IAS 17. The effect of this 
change will increase EBITDA. Currently operating lease expenses are recognised on a straight-line basis over the lease term; and
• operating lease cash flows are currently included within operating activities in the Consolidated Cash Flow Statement; under IFRS 16 
these will be recorded as cash flows from financing activities.
IFRS 9 Financial Instruments
The standard is effective from 1 January 2018 and replaces IAS 39 Financial Instruments. It brings together all three aspects of the 
accounting for financial instruments project: classification and measurement, impairment and hedge accounting. During 2017 the 
Group performed an impact assessment of the three aspects of IFRS 9 which are summarised below: 
Classification and measurement
Loans and trade receivables are held to collect contractual cash flows and are expected to give rise to cash flows representing solely 
payments of principal and interest. The Group analysed the contractual cash flow characteristics of those instruments and concluded 
that they meet the criteria for amortised cost measurement under IFRS 9. This is the same treatment as under IAS 39, therefore, 
reclassification is not required. 
Impairment
IFRS 9 requires the Group to record expected credit losses on all of its loans and trade receivables, either on a twelve-month or lifetime 
basis. The Group will apply the simplified approach detailed in IFRS 9 and record lifetime expected losses on its trade receivables. The 
Group, however, expects no material increase in the bad debt provision as a result of this change. 
Hedge accounting
The Group determined that existing hedge relationships are still deemed effective hedging relationships and hence will continue to 
qualify for hedge accounting under IFRS 9. As IFRS 9 does not change the general principles of how an entity accounts for effective 
hedges, applying the hedging requirements of IFRS 9 will not have a material impact on the Group’s Financial Statements after 
adoption. 
The assessment is based on currently available information and may be subject to change arising from further reasonable and 
supportable information being made available to the Group in 2018 when the standard is adopted. Overall, the Group expects no 
material impact on its Financial Statements.
3. SEGMENTAL INFORMATION
BUSINESS SEGMENTS
The Group’s activities are now predominantly focused in two main areas which are:
• Customer Experience; and
• Brand Deployment.
During the year there have been two changes to cost allocations within the segments as follows:
• Pass Through revenue, representing pre-agreed or contracted revenues that include an element regarding print, postal and other marketing 
material which are passed on to clients at cost as part of a wider service, is now reported directly within the Customer Experience and Brand 
Deployment segments. This change has been made to allow the full underlying segmental split of gross revenue to be better understood.
• Account management and service costs relating to Customer Experience clients, previously included within Central Costs, have now 
been recognised within the Customer Experience segment.
Pension scheme costs are included in the Corporate Costs segment. Financial Statements

BUSINESS SEGMENTS CONTINUED 
The Communisis Board, being the Chief Operating Decision Maker, considers the performance of Customer Experience and Brand 
Deployment in assessing the performance of the Group and making decisions about the allocation of resources. Segmental 
disclosures have therefore been presented on this basis.
Segment performance is evaluated based on profit from operations and is measured consistently with profit from operations in the 
Income Statement. However , Corporate Costs and Central Costs are managed on a Group basis and are not allocated to operating segments.
Transfer pricing between business segments is set on an arm’s length basis in a manner similar to transactions with third parties.
The revenue and operating profit figures reviewed by the Chief Operating Decision Maker exclude sales between business segments 
and, as such, sales between business segments are excluded from the figures in the segmental results tables below.

5.4 AMORTISATION OF ACQUIRED INTANGIBLES AND EXCEPTIONAL ITEMS CONTINUED
The £170,000 customer relationship asset write off relates to customer relationships valued as part of acquisition accounting in recent 
years. It is indicative of the current nature of client turnover in agency businesses where revenues are project based and not usually 
underpinned by long-term contracts.
The £361,000 reduction in contingent consideration relates to fair value revisions of the contingent consideration in respect of the 
acquisitions of Life Marketing Consultancy Limited (Life) and Psona Films Limited, being £300,000 and £61,000 respectively. The 
£452,000 reduction in contingent consideration in the year ended 31 December 2016 relates to fair value revisions of the contingent 
consideration in respect of the acquisitions of Life and The Meaningful Marketing Group Limited, being £200,000 and £252,000 
respectively.
The Group also incurred a charge of £506,000 in respect of the write off of unsupported assets which will not be recovered.
The trade name impairment of £232,000 in the year ended 31 December 2016 is in relation to Life. The trade name was assigned a 
value of £512,000 at acquisition on 5 January 2015. Trading with this business has been lower than expected resulting in the trade name 
impairment.
The £109,000 capital restructure costs in the year ended 31 December 2016 relate to non-recurring professional fees in relation to the 
capital reduction exercise undertaken during that year to create additional distributable reserves.

Current tax adjustments, in respect of prior years, relate to the release of provisions created in respect of prior years’ tax submissions, 
agreed in the current year.
RECONCILIATION OF THE TOTAL TAX CHARGE
The tax expense in the Income Statement for the year is lower (2016 higher) than the average standard rate of corporation tax in the 
UK of 19.25% (2016 20%). The differences are reconciled below:

The Group has unrecognised losses amounting to £380,000 (2016 £200,000), which arose outside of the UK and which are available 
indefinitely for offsetting against future taxable profits of the companies in which the losses arose. No deferred tax asset has been 
recognised in respect of these losses as they may not be used to offset taxable profits elsewhere in the Group and there is no evidence 
of recoverability in the near future. If the Group were able to recognise all unrecognised deferred tax assets, the profit would have 
been increased by £96,000.
DEFERRED TAX
Deferred tax included in the Consolidated Balance Sheet is as follows:
2017
£000 
2016
£000
Accelerated capital allowances (777) (925)
Other short-term timing differences 50 185

Pensions 5,221 7,331 
Financial liabilities 15 39 
Customer relationship intangible assets (196) (351) 
Deferred tax asset 4,636 6,406 
The realisation of the above current year deferred tax asset is dependent upon the anticipated continuing profitability of the Group. 
The deferred tax asset is recognised as the Directors foresee future profits adequate to assume recovery.
The deferred tax credit included in the Consolidated Income Statement is as follows:
2017

Deferred tax credit (776) (754) 
The provision for deferred tax at 31 December 2017 has been made at rates between 17% and 19% depending upon the anticipated time 
of reversal. This reflects the legislation included in the Finance Act 2016 reducing the rate of corporation tax to 17% from April 2020.  Financial Statements

7. ACQUISITION OF BUSINESS
In the year ended 31 December 2017 there have been movements in contingent consideration in relation to Psona Films Limited and Life 
as outlined below:
PSONA FILMS LIMITED
On 25 April 2014, the Group acquired the entire issued share capital of Jacaranda Productions Limited. On 30 June 2014 the Company’s 
name was changed to Psona Films Limited.
As part of the purchase agreement a contingent consideration was agreed. An amount equal to 10% of annual gross profits of the 
company was payable to the sellers at the end of each of the three earn-out periods, being the years ended 30 April 2015, 2016 and 
2017. The total contingent consideration would in no circumstance exceed the value of £500,000. As at the date of acquisition, the fair 
value of the contingent consideration was estimated at £200,000, determined using a discounted cash flow method.
As at 31 December 2017, a total of £139,000 had been paid out under this arrangement for the earn-out periods ending 30 April 2015 
and 30 April 2016. However, as the conditions of the contingent consideration arrangement were not met in the final earn-out period, 
the remaining balance at 30 April 2017 was written off to the Income Statement. A reconciliation of the fair value of the contingent 
consideration liability is provided below:
2017

At 31 December 2017 —
The results of this business are included within the Customer Experience segment.
LIFE MARKETING CONSULTANCY LIMITED
On 5 January 2015, the Group acquired the entire share capital of Life.
As part of the purchase agreement a contingent consideration was agreed, the mechanism for which was subsequently revised in 
2015 to maintain incentivisation for the management of Life. As at 31 December 2016, the fair value of all contingent consideration was 
revised to £300,000. The final contingent consideration liability will be quantified and settled in 2019.
An assessment of the likely contingent consideration payable was performed by looking at the relative likelihood of a range of 
outcomes of over or under achieving against the current forecasts over the earn-out period. As at 31 December 2017, using this 
methodology, the fair value of the contingent consideration was revised to £nil. A reconciliation of the fair value of the contingent 
consideration liability is provided below:
2017
£000
At 1 January 2017 300
Fair value revision (300)
At 31 December 2017 —
The results of this business are included within the Brand Deployment segment.
The Group has used Level 3 hierarchy valuation techniques to determine the fair value of the contingent consideration. The fair value 
hierarchy is described in Note 23.
In January 2017 the Group repaid the £9,300,000 two-year promissory loan note which was used to finance part of the initial 
consideration for the acquisition of Life Marketing Consultancy Limited.

Software assets are amortised evenly over their useful economic lives of between three and eight years. Included in software assets 
is £2,666,000 (2016 £336,000) currently in development. Amortisation is expected to commence in 2018.
As at 31 December 2017 the forecast revenue for some of the customer relationships within recent acquisitions had declined from initial 
expectations resulting in an indication of impairment. The relevant customer relationship assets have therefore been reduced 
accordingly and £170,000 (2016 £118,000) has been recorded in exceptional items (Note 5.4).
Included within licences are amounts spent for the development of software which the Group has the exclusive right to sell within the UK.
There are a number of assets included within software that have been fully amortised but are still in use by the Group. The total cost 
and accumulated amortisation of these assets at 31 December 2017 is £7,803,000 (2016 £8,954,000).
12. IMPAIRMENT OF GOODWILL
Goodwill acquired through business combinations is allocated for impairment testing purposes to two cash-generating units (CGUs), 
which are reportable segments, as follows:
• Customer Experience; and
• Brand Deployment.
These represent the lowest level within the Group at which goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes.
The carrying amount of goodwill allocated to cash-generating units is as follows:
2017 
£000 
2016
£000
Customer Experience 86,691 86,691 
Brand Deployment 77,330 77,330 
164,021 164,021 
The Group conducts annual impairment tests on the carrying value of goodwill using value in use calculations. The key assumptions 
included in the value in use calculations are revenue growth, product and services mix and profit margins, the long-term growth rates 
and the discount rate applied. Financial Statements
97 Communisis plc  Annual Report and Financial Statements 2017
12. IMPAIRMENT OF GOODWILL CONTINUED
The Group prepares cash flow forecasts for these CGUs based on the most recent annual budgets approved by the Board. These are 
based upon detailed budgets for the coming year and internal forecasts of future growth over a five-year period and cash flows 
beyond the five-year period are extrapolated using external forecasts of expected growth rates. Further information on the 
assumptions used within the major CGUs is detailed below.
KEY ASSUMPTIONS USED IN VALUE IN USE CALCULATIONS
The calculation of value in use for all CGUs is most sensitive to the following assumptions:
• revenue growth rates;
• product and services mix and profit margins; and
• growth rates used to extrapolate cash flows beyond the budget period.
In addition, the calculation of value in use is sensitive to movements in the discount rate.
Revenue growth included in the approved financial budgets
The revenue forecast in the Customer Experience cash flow projections, based on financial budgets, is a decline of 4% in 2018 followed 
by growth of between 3% and 5% in years two to five.
The revenue forecast in the Brand Deployment cash flow projections, based on financial budgets, is a decline of 2% in 2018 followed 
by growth of between 7% and 8% in years two to five.
Product and services mix and profit margins
Brand Deployment is expected to have an increased share of Group revenues relative to Customer Experience over the five-year 
forecast period.
The Group profit margin, based on gross revenue, is projected to increase from 5.6% in 2017 to 7.5% by the end of the detailed 
forecast period.
Profit growth rate used to extrapolate cash flows beyond the budget period
The profit growth rate used to extrapolate cash flow projections beyond the budget period for all CGUs is considered to be a 
representative rate for the markets to which these segments are dedicated and in line with long-term economic growth forecasts.
Profit growth rates have been assessed individually for each CGU. Profit growth rates of 1.9% have been used for Customer Experience 
and 2.4% for Brand Deployment.
Discount rates
The pre-tax discount rate applied to the Customer Experience cash flow projections is 11.4% and to Brand Deployment cash flow 
projections is 11.7%. This is the Group’s weighted average cost of capital adjusted to a pre-tax rate and adjusted to reflect 
management’s view of the market assessment of specific risks associated with each separate CGU.

Goodwill was allocated to each individual CGU using a relative value approach during the re-segmentation which was completed in 
2016. The growth rates used in years two to five are below the growth rates expected by management for the business.
In 2017 no impairment charges have been made (2016 £nil). The headroom at 31 December 2017 was £33m (2016 £35m) in the Customer 
Experience segment and £96m (2016 £87m) in the Brand Deployment segment. Financial Statements

12. IMPAIRMENT OF GOODWILL CONTINUED
SENSITIVITY TO CHANGES IN ASSUMPTIONS
There are reasonably possible changes in key assumptions within the Customer Experience segment which could erode the 
headroom. The sensitivity to each of these reasonably possible changes is detailed below. In each sensitivity assessment, all other 
items assumptions, other than the assumption being sensitised, remained equal:
• short-term revenue growth rates in years two to five would need to reduce from between 3% and 5% to between -1% and 1% to 
remove all headroom on the Customer Experience impairment test;
• the pre-tax discount rate would need to increase (in absolute terms) by 2.5% to remove all headroom within the Customer 
Experience impairment test;
• on average, long-term profit growth rates would need to be reduced (in absolute terms) by 2.5% to remove all headroom in the 
Customer Experience segment; and
• profit margin would need to drop by 1.8% in years two to five, which equates to a 14.3% drop in overall segmental profits, to remove 
all headroom in the Customer Experience segment.
There are no reasonably possible changes in key assumptions within the Brand Deployment segment which could erode the 
headroom to the point at which an impairment is necessary.
13. SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS
THE COMMUNISIS LONG TERM INCENTIVE PLAN 2007
Certain Directors and managers are eligible to participate in this plan at the discretion of the Remuneration Committee. 
The exercise price in respect of options granted under the scheme is £nil. There are no cash settlement alternatives. The share price 
measure, in respect of the 2015 grant of options, is calculated by reference to the average share price in the final three months of the 
three-year performance period in comparison with the average share price in the three months immediately preceding grant (“Base 
Share Price”). The Total Shareholder Return (TSR) measure, in respect of the 2017 grant of options, is measured by reference to the 
change in the Net Return Index of the Group over the three-year period commencing on the date of grant. The earnings per share 
performance will be measured on the basis of adjusted basic earnings per share (being earnings per share from continuing operations 
before exceptional items and amortisation of acquired intangible assets and the tax effect of these items). For attainment between 
certain annual growth rate thresholds, vesting will occur on a straight-line pro rata basis.
The Remuneration Committee will only sanction vesting of the awards granted if they are satisfied as to the Group’s underlying 
financial performance in the performance period.
Year of grant Vesting condition and period
2015 A maximum of 20% of the options will vest on the attainment of certain share price thresholds and the remaining 80% will vest on 
the attainment of growth in earnings per share over the financial years 2015–17. Vesting will be calculated by comparing earnings 
per share at the end of financial year 2017 to the earnings per share at 31 December 2014 and calculating the compound annual 
growth rate. 
2016 All options will vest on the attainment of growth in earnings per share over the financial years 2016–18. Vesting will be calculated 
by comparing earnings per share at the end of financial year 2018 to the earnings per share at 31 December 2015 and 
calculating the compound annual growth rate. 
2017 A maximum of 50% of the options will vest on the attainment of growth in TSR over three years from the date of grant and 
calculating the compound annual growth rate in this measure. The remaining 50% will vest on the attainment of growth in 
earnings per share over the financial years 2017–19. Vesting will be calculated by comparing earnings per share at the end of 
financial year 2019 to the earnings per share at 31 December 2016 and calculating the compound annual growth rate.
The fair value of options granted under the Long Term Incentive Plan 2007 in the year to 31 December 2017 was estimated on the date 
of grant using a binomial simulation option pricing model, taking into account the terms and conditions upon which the options were 
granted. The following were used in the option pricing model: 
2017 2016
Share price at the date of grant 52.50p 47.00p
Estimated annualised dividend yield 4.6% 4.7%
Risk-free interest rate 0.2% 0.5%
Expected volatility used in the modelling under the Black-Scholes valuation model 39.0% 38.7%
Weighted average fair value of the share options granted 33.38p 41.00p
The expected life of the options is based on historical data and is not necessarily indicative of exercise patterns which may occur. The 
expected volatility reflects historical volatility adjusted for future trends, which may also not necessarily be the actual outcome. Both 
the historical and expected volatilities reflect the volatility of the share prices of Communisis plc and comparator companies. Financial Statements

THE COMMUNISIS LONG TERM INCENTIVE PLAN 2007 CONTINUED

THE EXECUTIVE SHARE OPTION SCHEME 2010
Certain Directors and managers are eligible to participate in this scheme at the discretion of the Remuneration Committee. The 
exercise price of the options granted under this scheme is equal to the market value of the shares on the date of grant. No options 
were granted under this scheme in the year ended 31 December 2017 or in the year ended 31 December 2016.
THE SHARESAVE SCHEME
All UK employees (including Executive Directors) are eligible to participate in the Communisis Sharesave Scheme. The exercise price of 
the options is usually equal to the market price of the shares at the date of invitation to participate less a maximum discount of 20%. 
The options vest on the third anniversary of the commencement of the savings period. Any options which have not been exercised 
within six months of the vesting date lapse. 
No options were granted under the Sharesave Scheme in 2017.
The weighted average fair value of the options granted was estimated at the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing 
model. The following were used in the option pricing model and assumed that option holders will exercise their option at expiry:
2017 2016
Share price at the date of grant — 44.00p
Estimated annualised dividend yield — 5.0%
Risk-free interest rate — 0.6%
Expected volatility used in the modelling under the Black-Scholes valuation model — 38.9%
Exercise price for options exercisable three years after the date of grant — 45.75p
The volatility has been determined by reference to Communisis plc’s and comparator companies’ historical volatility over a three-year 
period, adjusted for expected future trends, to reflect the share price of Communisis plc in the future. The dilutive effect of outstanding 
options is reflected as additional share dilution in the computation of earnings per share.

14. RETIREMENT BENEFIT PLANS
The Group operates the Communisis Pension Plan which comprises a defined contribution and defined benefit section.
DEFINED CONTRIBUTION SECTION
The Group operates a UK defined contribution arrangement within all UK trading Group companies. The assets of the arrangements 
are held separately from those of the Group.
Group companies are required to contribute a specified percentage of payroll costs to the retirement benefit scheme to fund the 
benefits. The only obligation of the Group with respect to the retirement benefit scheme is to make the specified contributions.
The total cost charged to income of £3,007,000 (2016 £3,105,000) represents contributions payable to these arrangements by the 
Group at specified rates. At 31 December 2017, £478,000 of contributions due in respect of the current reporting period had not yet 
been paid over to the arrangements (2016 all paid over). This liability was paid on 4 January 2018.
The Group expects to contribute £3,000,000 to the defined contribution pension arrangements in 2018.
DEFINED BENEFIT SECTION
The section is closed to all members with no employees accruing further benefits under the plan.

Communisis Trustee (2011) Company Limited (the “Trustee”) has been appointed by Communisis to administer and manage the 
Communisis Pension Plan on behalf of the members in accordance with the terms of the Trust Deed and Rules of the Plan and relevant 
legislation. There are currently four Trustee Directors, two of whom are company nominated (one of whom is the Independent Chairman) 
and two of whom are member-nominated. One of the member-nominated Trustees is a current pensioner of the Communisis Pension 
Plan and the other an active contributing member. Member-nominated Trustee Directors are usually appointed for a three-year term 
but are then eligible for re-appointment subject to a vote of the membership.
The overall management of the investment of the assets of the Communisis Pension Plan is the responsibility of the Plan Trustees. 
However, the day-to-day execution of the investment and associated transactions is delegated to the Plan’s appointed 
Investment Managers.
The Trustees agreed investment strategy is based on analysis of the liability profile of the Plan and the risk and returns expected 
from the various asset classes held over the longer term. The primary objective of the Trustees is to operate a strategy which 
provides long-term growth and security for all beneficiaries.
The risk that the investments may not be sufficient to cover the Plan liabilities is one which is monitored by the Trustees and their 
advisers as well as by the Company. The funding position and the divergence of invested assets is under regular review.
During 2017, the Plan Trustees reviewed and implemented a new investment strategy for the Defined Benefit Section of the 
Communisis Pension Plan. The new investment strategy was agreed with the Company and is designed to achieve similar long term 
investment returns to the previous investment strategy but importantly it aims to do this by taking less investment risk. This has been 
achieved by improving asset diversification and hedging a greater proportion of the interest and inflation risk inherent in the Plan’s 
liabilities. The key new funds introduced were:
• Synthetic equity/liability driven investments – a pooled fund that uses derivatives in order to track global equity market returns and 
simultaneously provide exposure to changes in real interest rates. This fund helps increase the Plan’s hedging of the inflation risk 
inherent in its liabilities;
• Diversified alternatives – a pooled fund that invests across a range of mostly private market assets such as private equity, specialist 
property investments, infrastructure and private debt. The diversified nature of these asset classes and their less frequent pricing 
means that investment returns tend to be smoother than comparable public market investments; and
• Direct lending – this fund invests in senior loans of mostly mid-market European companies and the fund is expected to produce 
materially better returns than an investment in publicly quoted corporate debt.
The Communisis Pension Plan invests in liability driven investments (LDIs) to both reduce investment risk and to better manage the 
liabilities of the Plan. The objective of LDIs are to have sufficient assets to meet both current and future liabilities as they fall due rather 
than simply having assets which deliver a positive investment return. LDIs are executed using approaches ranging from increasing the 
duration of the gilt portfolio to the use of more sophisticated strategies using financial instruments such as swaps. LDIs are designed 
primarily to hedge interest and inflation risk with an element of active equity exposure in order to seek higher returns. We believe that 
LDIs are a key risk management tool given the impact that the fluctuations in liabilities can have on the Plan’s funding levels and 
deficits. 
The Group expects to pay £5,000,000 to the defined benefit pension scheme in 2018, of which £1,150,000 relates to annual rent and 
£1,000,000 to administration costs.
In February 2012 the Group and the Trustees agreed to a Central Asset Reserve arrangement involving the securitisation of a rental 
stream on one of the Group’s freehold properties to help address the pension fund deficit. In connection with the arrangement certain 
freehold property was transferred to a limited partnership established by the Group. The partnership is controlled by, and its results 
are consolidated by, the Group. The fair value of the assets transferred was £9,750,000 and on the same date the Plan used the 
contribution to acquire an interest in the partnership for its fair value of £9,750,000. The Plan’s partnership interest entitles it to a 
distribution of £1,150,000 each year from the income of the partnership over 15 years. The Plan’s interest in the partnership does not 
qualify as a Plan asset for the Group.
In addition to the rental payments referred to above, in order to remove the deficit, a further recovery plan (subject to reassessment 
following future triennial valuations) has been agreed. The latest triennial actuarial valuation for the pension scheme was performed 
at 31 March 2017. The recovery plan following completion of the triennial actuarial valuation comprises eight annual contributions, 
payable by 5 October each year from 2017 up to and including 2024. It was agreed that deficit repair contributions to the scheme will 
be £2,550,000, increasing in line with dividend increases, or 3% if higher. We believe this is a balanced outcome for the Group and 
pension scheme Trustees, and provides certainty over cash payments for the next three years. The Board continues to work with the 
Trustees to seek opportunities to reduce the deficit and liability exposure, and accelerate progress to the goal of “self-sufficiency” for 
the defined benefit pension scheme.  Financial Statements

Assumptions
Independent qualified actuaries have updated the accounting deficit valuation to take account of the requirements of IAS 19 Employee 
Benefits in order to assess the liabilities of the scheme at 31 December 2017. 
The principal weighted average assumptions used to determine benefit obligations for the Group’s Plan are shown below:
2017
% 
2016
%
Discount rate 2.50 2.70 
Inflation assumption – Retail Price Index 3.25 3.25 
Inflation assumption – Consumer Price Index 2.25 2.25 
Mortality rates
Mortality rates have assumed the base table of 110% of S2PA to be consistent with the approach adopted at the actuarial valuation 
dated 31 March 2017 (2016 base table of 110% of S1PA). Assumed life expectancy for a member aged 65 is as follows:
2017 
Y ears 
2016

Current pensioners:
Male 20.8 20.9 
Female 22.7 23.2 
Future pensioners:
Male 22.2 22.6 
Female 24.2 25.1 
Sensitivity analysis
Sensitivity analysis has been performed to determine the impact on the defined benefit obligation as a result of reasonable changes in 
the key assumptions occurring at the end of the reporting period.
A change of 0.1 percentage points in the discount rate would have the following effects:
Increase 
£000 
Decrease
£000
Discount rate
Effect on profit from operations (56) 45
Effect on defined benefit obligation (3,400) 3,400

£000 
Decrease

Inflation
Effect on profit from operations 56 (55)

An increase of one year in life expectancy would have the following effect:
Increase 
£000 
Effect on profit from operations 169
Effect on defined benefit obligation 6,500
The Plan is exposed to inflation and interest rate risk and changes in the life expectancy of pensioners. The Plan’s exposure to equity 
market risk is mitigated by a diverse portfolio of investments.
The weighted average duration of the defined benefit obligation at 31 December 2017 is approximately 17 years (2016 17 years).

79,341 67,024 
Trade receivables are non-interest bearing and generally on 30–90 days’ credit terms with an average of 50 days. The carrying value 
of trade receivables is considered a reasonable approximation of fair value. All of the Group’s trade and other receivables have been 
reviewed for indicators of impairment.
The doubtful debt provision has moved as follows:

At 1 January 1,404 306 
Provisions made during the year 166 1,104 
Released during the year (1,104) (6) 
At 31 December 466 1,404
In determining the recoverability of a trade receivable, the Group considers any change in the credit quality of the trade receivable 
from the date credit was initially granted up to the reporting date. The Group trades only with recognised, creditworthy third parties. 
The top 10 clients make up 56% of the receivables balance (2016 44%). Generally, clients who wish to trade on credit terms are subject 
to credit verification procedures. In addition, receivable balances are monitored on an ongoing basis with the result that the Group’s 
exposure to bad debts is not significant.
The Group has in place trade credit insurance arrangements which cover 38% of the Group’s revenue up to a maximum aggregate 
claim in any one year of £4,500,000. The concentration of credit risk is therefore limited to the carrying value of trade receivables not 
covered by the credit insurance. The Directors believe that there is no further credit provision required in excess of the allowance for 
doubtful debts, in respect of the portion not covered by the credit insurance, and an excess of £40,000 in respect of the portion 
covered by the credit insurance. Certain trade receivables were found to be impaired and a provision of £466,000 (2016 £1,404,000) 
is carried at the year end. Trade receivables are shown net of this doubtful debt provision.
In addition, some of the unimpaired trade receivables are past due as at the reporting date. The age of financial assets past due but 
not impaired is as follows:
2017 
£000 
2016
£000
Overdue by less than 30 days 3,960 1,407 
30–60 days overdue 1,156 550 
61–90 days overdue 647 300 
91+ days 2,283 327 
8,046 2,584
Management have considered the unimpaired receivables past due and do not consider there is any change in credit risk that requires 
any additional provisions. Financial Statements

BANK OVERDRAFTS
The bank overdrafts are principally denominated in Sterling and bear interest at rates set by reference to the UK base rate. The 
overdrafts are secured by cross guarantee arrangements with the relevant banks. At 31 December 2017 and 31 December 2016 bank 
overdraft facilities of £5,000,000 were available but not utilised.
£65,000,000 BANK LOAN
In August 2017 the £65,000,000 bank loan facility was renewed. This loan is secured by a cross guarantee arrangement and is 
repayable in August 2022. Interest is charged at LIBOR plus a rate of between 1.5% and 2.25% depending on the ratio of net debt to 
EBITDA in the preceding performance period.
The Group is subject to a number of covenants in relation to its borrowing, which, if breached, would result in its loans becoming 
immediately repayable. These covenants specify certain maximum limits in terms of net debt as a multiple of EBITDA and interest 
payable as a multiple of EBITA. At the year end, and throughout the year, the Group was not in breach of any bank covenants.
At 31 December 2017 the Group had available £12,000,000 (2016 £7,000,000) of undrawn committed borrowing facilities in respect of 
which all conditions precedent had been met.
With the exception of hire purchase agreements, early repayment is possible under the terms of all the borrowing facilities listed above 
at no cost by giving more than five days’ notice.

ONEROUS LEASES
The onerous lease provisions related to the estimated costs for the rental obligations in respect of the exits from Bangalore and 
Bothwell Street, Glasgow. The provisions reflected the estimated net cost to the Group over the remainder of the lease period. At 
31 December 2017 both provisions had been settled in full.

INTEREST RATE SWAPS
At 31 December 2017 the Group has two arrangements each of a notional amount of £10,000,000 with maturity dates being in 2018. 
The Group pays fixed rates of interest of 3.16% and 1.77% respectively on each arrangement and on both the Group receives a variable 
rate equal to LIBOR + 1.5% on the notional amount.
FAIR VALUE HIERARCHY
The Group used the following hierarchy for determining and disclosing the fair value of financial instruments by valuation technique:
Level 1: quoted (unadjusted) prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities;
Level 2:  other techniques for which all inputs which have a significant effect on the recorded fair value are observable either directly 
or indirectly; and
Level 3:   techniques which use inputs which have a significant effect on the recorded fair value that are not based on observable 
market data.
As at 31 December 2017 the Group held the following financial instruments measured at fair value:
2017

Level 1 
£000 
Level 2 
£000 
Level 3
£000
Financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss
Interest rate swaps 94 — 94 —
During the year there were no transfers between Level 1 and Level 2 fair value measurements and no transfers into or out of Level 3 fair 
value measurements.
As disclosed within Note 27, the fair value of loans has been calculated using Level 2 valuation techniques and the fair value of 
contingent consideration has been calculated using Level 3 valuation techniques as outlined in Note 7. Financial Statements

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED

26. FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT OBJECTIVES AND POLICIES
The Group’s principal financial instruments comprise bank loans and overdrafts (Note 20), cash and short-term deposits (Note 18) 
and interest rate swaps (Note 23). The main purpose of these financial instruments is to raise finance for the Group’s operations and 
to manage interest rate risk. The Group has various other financial assets and liabilities such as trade receivables and trade payables, 
which arise directly from its operations.
It is, and has been throughout the year under review, the Group’s policy that no trading in financial instruments shall be undertaken.
The main risks arising from the Group’s financial instruments are cash flow interest rate risk, foreign currency risk, liquidity risk and 
credit risk.
CASH FLOW INTEREST RATE RISK
The Group’s exposure to the risk of changes in market interest rates relates primarily to the Group’s medium-term debt obligations 
with a floating interest rate.
All borrowings are held on floating rate terms and so the Group is exposed to interest rate movements on these borrowings. The 
Group’s policy is to monitor interest rate exposure on this floating rate debt and maintain interest rate swaps through separate 
financial instruments where appropriate. At the end of 2017 the Group has two arrangements each with a notional amount of 
£10,000,000, covering 88% of the year end bank debt (2016 100%). Within bank debt the Group includes all interest-bearing bank 
loans and borrowings, less cash and cash equivalents.
At 31 December 2017, if interest rates had been 100 basis points higher for the full financial year, with all other variables held constant, 
this would have resulted in a reduction of pre-tax profits of £330,000 and a post-tax reduction in equity of £266,000; if interest rates 
had been lower by 25 basis points throughout the financial year the pre-tax profits would have been £83,000 higher and the post-tax 
impact on equity would have been an increase of £67,000.
FOREIGN CURRENCY RISK
The Group operates principally in the UK with approximately 30% (2016 26%) of sales denominated in currencies other than Sterling 
and, of this figure, 26% (2016 24%) of sales arising from companies operating with functional currencies other than Sterling.
The majority of foreign currency transactions are naturally hedged from buying and selling within the same currency. Where this is not 
the case, and Communisis is entering into a significant foreign currency transaction with no natural hedge in place, the Group enters 
into forward foreign exchange contracts to control these risks. There were no foreign currency contracts outstanding at the year end 
(2016 none).
LIQUIDITY RISK
The Group regularly monitors its risk to a shortage of funds, taking account of the maturity profile of its financial assets and liabilities 
and the projected cash flows from operations.
The Group’s objective is to maintain a balance between continuity of funding and flexibility through a mix of medium-term funding of 
committed floating rate facilities supplemented by uncommitted bank overdraft facilities.
In 2017 the Group refinanced its borrowings which are repayable in August 2022. At 31 December 2017 none of the Group’s medium-
term debt matures in less than 12 months (2016 £nil), none matures between one and two years from the Balance Sheet date (2016 
100%) and 100% matures between two to five years from the Balance Sheet date (2016 £nil).
The Directors consider this funding structure to be adequate for the Group’s current requirements.
The maturity profile of the Group’s financial liabilities at 31 December 2017 is shown in Note 27.
CREDIT RISK
The Group trades only with recognised, creditworthy third parties. Generally, customers who wish to trade on credit terms are subject 
to credit verification procedures. During the year the Group has entered into trade credit insurance arrangements which cover 38% of 
the Group’s turnover up to a maximum aggregate claim in any one year of £4,500,000. The concentration of credit risk is therefore 
limited to the carrying value of trade receivables not covered by the credit insurance as disclosed in Note 16. The Group’s exposure to 
credit risk arises from the default of the counterparty, with a maximum exposure equal to the carrying amount of these instruments. 
As at the Balance Sheet date there are no significant concentrations of credit risk within the Group.
The credit risk arising from the other financial assets of the Group, which comprise cash and cash equivalents, is managed by Group 
treasury in accordance with Group policy. Investments of surplus funds are only made with established banks approved by the Board. 
The Group’s exposure to credit risk arises from default of the counterparty, with a maximum exposure equal to the carrying amount of 
these instruments. Financial Statements

26. FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT OBJECTIVES AND POLICIES CONTINUED
CAPITAL MANAGEMENT
The primary objective of the Group’s capital management is to ensure that it maintains a strong credit rating and healthy capital 
ratios in order to support the business and maximise shareholder value.
The Group monitors capital using a gearing ratio, being bank debt divided by equity plus bank debt. The policy is to maintain 
the gearing ratio below 50%. Within bank debt the Group includes all interest-bearing bank loans and borrowings, less cash and 
cash equivalents.

Equity 139,136 118,215 
Capital and bank debt 161,954 137,921

For the purposes of capital management, the Group considers undiscounted interest-bearing loans and borrowings as the 
appropriate measure for the purposes of determining bank debt.

Carrying value is considered to approximate fair value for all of the Group’s financial instruments other than bank loans, which have a 
carrying value of £52,404,000 (2016 £57,824,000) and a fair value of £57,262,000 (2016 £59,470,000). The fair value of loans has been 
calculated using Level 2 valuation techniques reflecting the borrowing rate at the end of the reporting period and any unamortised 
arrangement fees relating to those borrowings. The known non-performance risk at 31 December 2017 was assessed to be insignificant.
28. CAPITAL COMMITMENTS
As at 31 December 2017 the Group had not entered into any contractual commitments for the acquisition of property, plant and 
equipment (2016 £494,000) or intangible assets (2016 £nil). Financial Statements

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED

29. CONTINGENT LIABILITIES
The Group has contingent liabilities where it has provided rental guarantees to landlords in respect of certain leasehold properties 
occupied by companies that were formerly subsidiaries in the Group, but have subsequently been sold. The principal risk is that 
current leasehold occupants will become insolvent and that guarantees will be called, resulting in a material cash cost to the Group. 
To the extent that they have not already been called, these guarantees represent contingent liabilities of the Group. Other than those 
leases for which the liability is considered to be remote, the Group has guaranteed rentals on a lease with a remaining term of six 
years, with an annual rental of £1,135,000. In addition, there are four further rental guarantees totalling £80,000 with remaining lease 
terms of between two and six years. No provision for these guarantees has been made in the Financial Statements because, at the 
Balance Sheet date, the Directors believe that it is not probable that they will be called.

NOTES TO THE COMPANY FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2017
1. AUTHORISATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND STATEMENT OF COMPLIANCE WITH FRS 101
The Financial Statements of Communisis plc (the “Company”) for the year ended 31 December 2017 were authorised for issue on

incorporated and domiciled in England and Wales.
The Company Financial Statements are prepared in accordance with Financial Reporting Standard 101 Reduced Disclosure Framework 
(FRS 101) and in accordance with applicable United Kingdom law and accounting standards.
The Company’s Financial Statements are presented in Sterling and all values are rounded to the nearest thousand British pounds 
(£000) except where otherwise indicated.
The results of Communisis plc are included in the Consolidated Financial Statements of Communisis plc which are available from 
Communisis House, Manston Lane, Leeds LS15 8AH.
The principal accounting policies adopted by the Company are set out in Note 2.
2. ACCOUNTING POLICIES
2.1 BASIS OF PREPARATION

31 December 2017.
The Company has taken advantage of the following disclosure exemptions under FRS 101:
(a)   the requirements of paragraphs 45(b) and 46–52 of IFRS 2 Share-based Payment, because the share-based payment arrangement 
concerns its own equity instruments and its separate Financial Statements are presented alongside the Consolidated Financial 
Statements of the Group and the disclosures are included in the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Group in which the entity 
is consolidated;
(b)   the requirements of IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures, as the disclosures are included in the Consolidated Financial 
Statements of the Group in which the entity is consolidated;

 (i)  paragraph 79(a)(iv) of IAS 1;
 (ii)  paragraph 73(e) of IAS 16 Property, Plant and Equipment; and
 (iii)  paragraph 118(e) of IAS 38 Intangible Assets;
(e)   the requirements of paragraphs 10(d), 10(f), 16, 38A, 38B, 38C, 38D, 40A, 40B, 40C, 40D, 111 and 134 to 136 of IAS 1 Presentation of 
Financial Statements;

(g)  the requirements of paragraphs 30 and 31 of IAS 8 Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors;
(h)  the requirements of paragraph 17 of IAS 24 Related Party Disclosures;
(i)   the requirements in IAS 24 Related Party Disclosures to disclose related party transactions entered into between two or more 
members of a group, provided that any subsidiary which is a party to the transaction is wholly owned by such a member; and
(j)   the requirements of paragraphs 130(f)(ii), 130(f)(iii), 134(d)–134(f) and 135(c)–135(e) of IAS 36 Impairment of Assets as the disclosures 
are included in the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Group in which the entity is consolidated.
The Company has taken advantage of the exemption provided by Section 408 of the Companies Act 2006 not to publish its individual 
Income Statement and related notes.
The Company has net current liabilities of £25,022,000 as at 31 December 2017 (2016 net current liabilities of £15,486,000). The 
Company’s objectives, policies and processes for managing its liquidity risk, as well as potential exposure to cash flow interest rate 
risk, are described in Note 26 in the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Through the Group, the Company has considerable financial resources and, as a consequence, the Directors believe that the 
Company is well placed to manage its business risks successfully.
After making enquiries, the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Company has adequate resources to continue in 
operational existence for the foreseeable future. Accordingly, they continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the 
Financial Statements. Financial Statements

2. ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED
2.2 SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING JUDGEMENTS AND ESTIMATES
Estimation uncertainty
The key assumptions concerning the future and other key sources of estimation uncertainty at the Balance Sheet date that have a 
significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year are 
discussed below.
Pensions
The actuarial valuation involves making assumptions about discount rates, mortality rates and future pension increases. Due to the 
long-term nature of these plans, such estimates are subject to significant uncertainty. Additional information is included in Note 18.
2.3 SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Intangible assets
Intangible assets are carried at cost less accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses. Intangible assets created 
within the business are not capitalised (unless specific conditions are met) and expenditure is charged to the Income Statement in the 
year in which the expenditure is incurred.
Acquired computer software and licences are capitalised. These costs are amortised over their estimated useful lives (three to 
eight years).
Costs associated with maintaining computer software programs are recognised as an expense as incurred. Costs that are directly 
associated with the production of identifiable and unique software products controlled by the Company, and that will generate 
probable economic benefits exceeding costs beyond one year, are recognised as intangible assets. Direct costs include the costs of 
software development employees. These costs are amortised over their estimated useful lives (three to eight years).
Useful lives are also examined on an annual basis and adjustments, where applicable, are made on a prospective basis.
Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment in the Financial Statements of the Company are stated at cost, less aggregate depreciation and any 
provision for impairment.
Depreciation is calculated on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the asset as follows:
Plant and equipment 3 to 10 years
The carrying values of property, plant and equipment are reviewed for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate 
the carrying value may not be recoverable. If any such indication exists, and where the carrying values exceed the estimated 
recoverable amount, the assets are written down to their recoverable amount. The recoverable amount of property, plant and 
equipment is the greater of fair value less costs to sell and value in use. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are 
discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money 
and the risks specific to the asset. Useful economic lives, depreciation methods and residual values are reviewed annually. For an asset 
that does not generate largely independent cash inflows, the recoverable amount is determined for the cash-generating unit to which 
the asset belongs. Impairment losses are recognised in the Income Statement.
Investments
Investments are shown at cost less provision for impairment. The cost of an investment is measured as the aggregate of the 
consideration transferred, measured at acquisition date fair value. Any contingent consideration will be recognised at fair value at the 
acquisition date. Subsequent changes to the fair value of the contingent consideration which is deemed to be an asset or a liability will 
be recognised in accordance with IAS 39 either in profit and loss or in other comprehensive income. If the contingent consideration is 
classed as equity, it is not remeasured until it is finally settled within equity.
Investments are reviewed for impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that its carrying 
value may be impaired. Investments are allocated to the related cash-generating units monitored by management for the purpose of 
impairment testing.
Trade and other receivables
Trade and other receivables, which generally have 30–90 day credit terms, are recognised and carried at original invoice amount less 
an allowance for any uncollectable amounts. An estimate for doubtful debts is made. Bad debts are written off when identified.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents in the Balance Sheet comprise cash at bank and in hand and short-term deposits with an original maturity 
of three months or less. Financial Statements

NOTES TO THE COMPANY FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2016
2. ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED
2.3 SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED
Trade and other payables
Trade and other payables, which generally have 30-90 day credit terms, are recognised and carried at original invoice amount.
Income tax
Current tax, being UK corporation tax, is provided at amounts expected to be paid (or recovered) using the tax rates and laws that 
have been enacted or substantively enacted by the Balance Sheet date.
Deferred income tax is provided, using the liability method, on all temporary differences at the Balance Sheet date between the tax 
bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts for financial reporting purposes.
Deferred income tax liabilities are recognised for all taxable temporary differences except in respect of taxable temporary differences 
associated with investments in subsidiaries, where the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences can be controlled and it is 
probable that the temporary differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary differences arise from the initial recognition of goodwill, or from 
the initial recognition (other than in a business combination) of other assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the 
taxable profit nor the accounting profit.
Deferred income tax assets are recognised for all deductible temporary differences carry-forward of unused tax assets and unused tax 
losses, to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which the deductible temporary differences and the 
carry-forward of unused tax assets and unused tax losses can be utilised. In respect of deductible temporary differences associated 
with investments in subsidiaries, deferred tax assets are only recognised to the extent that it is probable that the temporary differences 
will reverse in the foreseeable future and taxable profit will be available against which the temporary differences can be utilised.
The carrying amount of deferred income tax assets is reviewed at each Balance Sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no 
longer probable that sufficient taxable profit will be available to allow all or part of the deferred income tax asset to be utilised.
Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply to the year when the asset is 
realised or the liability is settled, based on tax rates (and tax laws) that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the Balance 
Sheet date.
Income tax relating to items recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity is also recognised in other comprehensive 
income or directly in equity.
Foreign currencies
The Company’s functional currency and presentation currency is Sterling. Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded at the rate 
ruling at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rate of 
exchange ruling at the Balance Sheet date. All differences are taken to the Income Statement. Non-monetary items that are measured 
in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rates as at the dates of the initial transactions. 
Non-monetary items measured at fair value in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rates at the date when the fair 
value was determined.
Pension costs
The Company operates defined contribution and defined benefit pension plans.
Payments to defined contribution pension plans are charged as an expense to the Income Statement as incurred when the related employee 
service is rendered. The Company has no further legal or constructive payment obligations once the contributions have been made.
The defined benefit pension plan is a Group scheme, as detailed in the Group accounting policies note in the Group Consolidated 
Financial Statements on page 83.
In accordance with the Company policy in respect of the defined benefit pension scheme, a proportion equating to 12.3% of all 
movements on the defined benefit scheme is recognised within the Company accounts. This proportion is based on the number of 
members employed by the Company at the time that the scheme was closed to future accrual. The proportionate split is applied to all 
costs, settlements and actuarial gains and losses as detailed below.
The costs of administering the defined benefit pension scheme are recognised in employee benefits expense in the Income Statement.
When a settlement (eliminating all obligations for benefits already accrued) or a curtailment (reducing future obligations as a result of 
a material reduction in the scheme membership or a reduction in future entitlement) occurs, the obligation and the related plan assets 
are remeasured using current actuarial assumptions and the resultant gain or loss is recognised in the Income Statement during the 
period in which the settlement or curtailment occurs.
All actuarial gains and losses that arise in calculating the present value of the defined benefit obligation and the fair value of plan 
assets are recognised immediately in the Statement of Comprehensive Income. Financial Statements
121 Communisis plc  Annual Report and Financial Statements 2017
2. ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED
2.3 SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED
Leases
The determination of whether an arrangement is, or contains, a lease is based on the substance of the arrangement at inception date: 
whether fulfilment of the arrangement is dependent on the use of a specific asset or assets or the arrangement conveys a right to the 
use of assets.
Operating lease payments are recognised as an expense in the Income Statement on a straight-line basis over the lease term or in 
accordance with utilisation of the leased asset if more appropriate.
Employee share ownership plan
Communisis plc shares held by the Company are classified in shareholders’ equity as the “ESOP reserve” and are recognised at cost. 
Consideration received for the sale of such shares is also recognised in equity, with any difference between the proceeds from sale and 
the original cost being taken to retained earnings. No gain or loss is recognised in the Income Statement on the purchase, sale, issue or 
cancellation of equity shares.
Borrowings
Borrowings are recognised initially at fair value, net of transaction costs incurred. Borrowings are subsequently stated at amortised 
cost; any difference between the proceeds (net of transaction costs) and the redemption value is recognised in the Income Statement 
over the period of the borrowings using the effective interest method.
Borrowings are classified as current liabilities unless the Company has an unconditional right to defer settlement of the liability for at 
least 12 months after the Balance Sheet date.
Provisions
Provisions are recognised when the Company has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past event, it is probable 
that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate can be 
made, but there is some uncertainty about the timing or amount of the future expenditure required in settlement. If the effect of the 
time value of money is material, provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at a pre-tax rate that reflects 
current market assessments of the time value of money and, where appropriate, the risks specific to the liability. Where discounting is 
used, the increase in the provision due to the passage of time is recognised as a finance cost.
Share-based payment transactions
Certain Directors and management are eligible to participate in share-based payment schemes, all of which are equity-settled, in 
return for services provided to Communisis plc.
The cost of equity-settled transactions with employees is measured by reference to the fair value at the date on which they are granted. 
The fair value is determined by an external valuer using an appropriate model. In valuing equity-settled transactions, no account is 
taken of any vesting conditions, other than conditions linked to the price of the shares of Communisis plc (“market conditions”).
The cost of equity-settled transactions is recognised, together with a corresponding increase in equity, over the period in which the 
performance or service conditions are fulfilled, ending on the date on which the relevant employees become fully entitled to the award 
(“the vesting date”). The cumulative expense recognised for equity-settled transactions at each reporting date reflects the extent to 
which the vesting period has expired and the Company’s best estimate of the number of equity instruments that will ultimately vest.
No expense is recognised for awards that do not ultimately vest, except for awards where vesting is conditional upon a market or 
non-vesting condition, which are treated as vesting irrespective of whether or not the market or non-vesting condition is satisfied, 
provided that all other performance or service conditions are satisfied.
Where an equity-settled award is cancelled, it is treated as if it had vested on the date of cancellation, and any cost not yet recognised 
in the Income Statement for the award is expensed immediately. This includes any award where non-vesting conditions within the 
control of the Company or the employee are not met. Any compensation paid up to the fair value of the award at the cancellation or 
settlement date is deducted from equity, with any excess over fair value being treated as an expense in the Income Statement.
Where an equity-settled award is forfeited, the total cost recognised in the Income Statement to date for the award is reversed.
Derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting
Initial recognition and subsequent measurement
The Company uses derivative financial instruments such as forward currency contracts and interest rate swaps to hedge its foreign 
currency and interest rate risks respectively. Such derivative financial instruments are initially recognised at fair value on the date on 
which a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently remeasured at fair value. Derivatives are carried as financial assets 
when the fair value is positive and as financial liabilities when the fair value is negative.
Any gains or losses arising from changes in fair value on derivatives during the year that do not qualify for hedge accounting and the 
ineffective portion of an effective hedge are taken directly to the Income Statement.
The fair value of interest rate swaps is the difference between the fixed rate and the one-month LIBOR rate implied at the Balance 
Sheet date, calculated monthly, and discounted to present value. Financial Statements
122 Communisis plc  Annual Report and Financial Statements 2017
2. ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED
2.3 SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED
Derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting continued
Initial recognition and subsequent measurement continued
For the purpose of hedge accounting, hedges are classified as cash flow hedges when hedging exposure to variability in cash flows, 
which is either attributable to a particular risk associated with a recognised asset or liability or a highly probable forecast transaction, 
or when hedging the foreign currency risk in an unrecognised firm commitment.
For those derivatives designated as hedges and for which hedge accounting is desired, the hedging relationship is formally designated and 
documented at its inception. This documentation identifies the risk management objective and strategy for undertaking the hedge, the 
hedging instrument, the hedged item or transaction, the nature of the risk being hedged and how effectiveness will be measured throughout 
its duration. Such hedges are expected to be highly effective in offsetting changes in fair value or cash flows and are assessed on an ongoing 
basis to determine that they actually have been highly effective throughout the financial reporting periods for which they were designated.
Cash flow hedges
The effective portion of the gain or loss on the hedging instrument is recognised directly in equity, while any ineffective portion is 
recognised immediately in the Income Statement.
Amounts taken to equity are transferred to the Income Statement when the hedged transaction affects profit or loss, such as when the hedged 
financial income or financial expense is recognised or when a forecast sale occurs. Where the hedged item is the cost of a non-financial asset 
or non-financial liability, the amounts taken to equity are transferred to the initial carrying amount of the non-financial asset or liability.
If the forecast transaction or firm commitment is no longer expected to occur, amounts previously recognised in equity are transferred to the 
Income Statement. If the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised without replacement or rollover, or if its designation 
as a hedge is revoked, amounts previously recognised in equity remain in equity until the forecast transaction or firm commitment occurs.

18. RETIREMENT BENEFIT PLANS
The Company operates the Communisis Pension Plan which comprise a defined contribution and defined benefit section.
DEFINED CONTRIBUTION SECTION
The Company operates UK defined contribution arrangements. The assets of the arrangements are held separately from those 
of the Company.
The Company is required to contribute a specified percentage of payroll costs to the retirement benefit scheme to fund the benefits. 
The only obligation of the Company with respect to the retirement benefit scheme is to make the specified contributions.
The total cost charged to income of £106,000 (2016 £165,000) represents contributions payable to these arrangements by the 
Company at specified rates. At 31 December 2017, £16,000 of contributions due in respect of the current reporting period had not yet 
been paid over to the arrangements (2016 all paid over). This liability was paid on 4 January 2018.
The Company expects to contribute £0.1m (2016 £0.1m) to the defined contribution pension arrangements in 2018.
DEFINED BENEFIT SECTION
These Financial Statements include a proportion of the Group pension deficit and charge which has been allocated to the Company 
based on the number of members employed by the Company at the time the scheme was closed to future accrual.

21. CONTINGENT LIABILITIES
The Company has contingent liabilities where it has provided rental guarantees to landlords in respect of certain leasehold properties 
occupied by companies that were formerly subsidiaries in the Group, but have subsequently been sold. The principal risk is that 
current leasehold occupants will become insolvent and that guarantees will be called, resulting in a material cash cost to the Group. 
To the extent that they have not already been called, these guarantees represent contingent liabilities of the Company. Other than 
those leases for which the liability is considered to be remote, the Company has guaranteed rentals on a lease with a remaining term 
of six years, with an annual rental of £1,135,000. In addition, there are four further rental guarantees totalling £80,000 with remaining 
lease terms of between two and six years. No provision for these guarantees has been made in the Financial Statements because, 
at the Balance Sheet date, the Directors believe that it is not probable that they will be called.
22. RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS
The Company has taken advantage of the exemption under paragraph 8(k) of FRS 101 not to disclose related party transactions with 
its wholly owned subsidiaries. Remuneration of key management personnel is disclosed in the Directors’ Remuneration Report on 
pages 44 to 59.
