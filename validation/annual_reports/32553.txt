2  De La Rue  Annual Report 2017 I am delighted to report that the Group 
has delivered good results in 2016/17.
Strategic progress
The strategic plan set out by the 
management team in May 2015 is 
progressing well. Identity Solutions and 
Product Authentication businesses 
delivered strong revenue and operating 
profit growth, further improving and 
diversifying our business mix, while 
the currency business performed 
with resilience.
In January 2017, we completed our first 
acquisition in 14 years, adding DuPont 
Authentication to the De La Rue family. 
With a strong intellectual property 
portfolio, global blue-chip customers and 
a committed and experienced workforce, 
it is an excellent strategic fit and will 
be a great addition to the Group. 
The banknote manufacturing footprint 
restructuring programme is progressing 
to plan. Our continuous focus on improving 
efficiency and careful allocation of capital 
has provided a solid platform to support 
further growth. 
We completed the sale of the 
underperforming Cash Processing 
Solutions business in May 2016. 
Financial performance
Revenue grew 2% overall, reflecting 
the strong volumes from the Currency 
segment and the good progress made 
in the Identity Solutions and Product 
Authentication businesses during the 
year. Adjusted operating profit* was 
similar to last year at £70.7m despite 
the conclusion of a material security 
features contract last year. On an IFRS 
basis operating profit was £70.2m, up 
from £66.8m last year, reflecting lower 
exceptional charges in the current year. 
Adjusted basic earnings per share* 
decreased by 2% due to the benefit of a 
non-recurring tax benefit in the prior year.
Cash generated from operating 
activities, which includes the impact 
of discontinued operations, was up 9% 
at £64.3m. The benefit of higher profits 
in the year was offset by adverse working 
capital movements due to the timing of 
shipments and a reduction in advanced 
payments. Following the $25m acquisition 
of DuPont Authentication, which was 
funded from the existing credit facility, 
net debt as at 25 March 2017 increased 
by £14.8m to £120.9m.
Dividend
In order to deliver long term shareholder 
value and maintain financial flexibility 
to sustain future growth, the Board 
proposes to leave the dividend 
unchanged and is recommending 
a final dividend of 16.7p per share 
(2015/16: 16.7p per share). This, together 
with the 8.3p paid in January 2017, 
will make a full year dividend of 25.0p 
per share. 
The Board
The Board and I feel that we have the 
right balance of skills and experience 
to support the management team. 
The appointment on 21 July 2016 of 
Nick Bray, Chief Financial Officer of 
Sophos Group plc, as a Non-executive 
Director and Chair of the Audit Committee, 
has further strengthened the Board. 
Nick brings extensive experience in 
the technology and information security 
industries and we welcome him on board.
Rupert Middleton, Chief Operating Officer 
and Executive Director, has informed the 
Board of his intention to step down from 
the Board after the AGM on 20 July 2017. 
We are grateful for his contribution and 
wish him well for his future. The position 
will be replaced by the newly created role 
of Chief Operations Director which will 
not be a Board position. A search has 
commenced to identify suitable internal 
and external candidates.
Culture and people
We are committed to fostering a 
dynamic, agile and high performing 
culture that drives the growth of the 
business. Our people are critical to the 
successful execution of our strategy and 
to fulfilling our purpose. We continue to 
engage with and invest in our people 
through training and development.
In December 2016, we undertook an 
employee survey and were delighted 
that 85% of our colleagues participated 
and provided us with their feedback. 
While the results of the survey were 
highly encouraging, we recognise 
we have more to do in a number of 
areas and the survey provides us with 
invaluable insights to act upon. 
142
Countries exported to in the last three years.
3,150
We employ around 3,150 people worldwide.
Our people are committed to serving 
our customers and are often the 
difference between De La Rue and our 
competitors. In 2016/17, they managed 
to deliver high volumes in both print 
and paper despite the disruptions from 
the footprint restructuring programme. 
On behalf of the Board, I would like 
to thank them for their continued 
commitment and dedication. 
Corporate responsibility
I am proud that we have signed the UN 
Global Compact, aligning our strategy 
and operations with the principles 
on human rights, labour, environment 
and anti-corruption. In line with our 
core values, we are committed to the 
integration of broader social, ethical, 
and sustainable practices across our 
day-to-day business. Further information 
can be found in our corporate responsibility 
section on pages 42 to 49.
Outlook
We started the year with good momentum 
and a strong order book of £387m. 
While the sustained weakness of sterling 
gives us a competitive advantage in the 
export market, most of our sales are 
invoiced in sterling and therefore do not 
automatically result in higher margins. 
We will continue to increase investments 
in R&D, product management and sales 
capability. Taking this into account, 
as well as the increased costs of 
raw materials, the Board is confident 
of continued progression and its 
expectations for the financial year 
of 2017/18 remain unchanged.

THE ROLE OF CASH 
A LESS CASH SOCIETY, BUT NOT A CASHLESS SOCIETY
8  De La Rue  Annual Report 2017 Cash means growth
There is a strong correlation between cash in circulation and GDP growth. While Norway, 
Sweden and Japan have particular circumstances that have led to them bucking the trend, 
almost every major economy follows this rule.
The value of money circulating has increased at a rate higher than GDP growth in 70% 
of countries since December 2012.
Reports of the death of cash have been 
greatly exaggerated. With qualities 
that include portability, divisibility and 
durability, cash is forecast to grow and 
remain central to the world’s economy. 
A cashless society is about as likely as 
the paperless office that some insisted 
was within touching distance a decade 
or more ago. Just as new technologies 
such as email and cloud computing 
came to co-exist alongside paper, 
innovations including credit cards, 
digital wallets and crypto currencies are 
complementing – not replacing – cash. 
Although the world is absolutely right 
to welcome any technology that has 
the potential to drive choice and social 
inclusion, we should not lose sight of 
the facts: 38% of the world’s population 
don’t have bank accounts
1
; the demand 
for ATMs continues to grow worldwide
2
, 
with numbers set to increase by c5% 
a year; December 2016 saw more cash 
withdrawn from ATMs in the UK than 
any month in history
3
; and even Sweden, 
probably the most cashless society in the 
world, has had to backtrack on its policy 
of removing ATMs
4
, due to public outcry. 
All of which support our own analysis 
that while the proportion of transactions 
carried out in cash will decline, the total 
volume of cash in circulation globally 
will rise by 3–4% a year over the next 
10 years
5
. (see chart on correlation 
between cash in circulation and GDP).
So what’s behind our planet’s enduring 
preference for cash? 
The world’s most socially inclusive 
payment method
Access to financial services is one 
of the UN’s principal Sustainable 
Development Goals for 2030. Due to 
cost, the technology infrastructure to 
support cashless transactions simply 
doesn’t exist across vast tracts of the 
world. And where it does exist, even 
a temporary glitch in availability can 
cause major problems. In October 
2016, one of the UK supermarket 
chains, for example, incurred the 
wrath of its customers when the 
loss of internet connection meant 
that electronic payments could not 
be processed.
Added to this, the UNHCR
6
 reports 
that one million children per week 
are born without their births being 
registered – no birth certificate, no 
proof of identity, no bank account or 
access to financial tools. With 1.8 billion 
people without bank accounts, cash 
is the world’s most socially inclusive 
payment method – and will remain 
so for the foreseeable future.
Changing demographics 
further complicate the issue. 
Ageing populations are less digitally 
savvy than younger generations – and 
even in Western Europe there’s a real 
risk that any pronounced shift to a 
cashless society would further highlight 
the differences between the haves and 
the have-nots.
It may come as a surprise to those 
of us who think nothing of tapping in 
and out of the public transport network 
or buying groceries online, but cash 
is here to stay. Cash will continue to 
co-exist alongside the digital economy. 
And in the absence of infrastructure 
that is both 100% available and reliable, 
it will remain the foundation for the 
majority of the world’s transactions.

 Annual Report 2017  De La Rue  9 Reality 
check?
Counterfeiting, smuggling and tax 
evasion currently cost the world 
US$1.8 trillion
1
 – enough to lift around 
1.4 billion people out of poverty for six 
years. If this was a country, it would 
have the tenth largest economy in the 
world by GDP – and it’s growing fast, 
driven by globalisation and increases 
in consumer spending. It’s common 
to find counterfeit goods produced 
on one continent, trafficked across 
another and sold on a third. 
Let’s examine what this means for 
economies and citizens, as well as 
for the brands being counterfeited. 
Firstly, it reduces government 
revenue. Illicit trade perpetuates 
the grey and black economies, 
reduces the amount of tax available 
to governments and corrodes a 
country’s ability to drive economic 
and social wellbeing. Potentially, this 
is a huge global trade issue. It’s not 
far-fetched to imagine governments 
using tariffs against countries that fail 
to combat counterfeiting.
Secondly, counterfeiting supports 
crime and terrorism. According to 
the World Health Organisation, trade 
in fake tobacco funds human and arms 
trafficking as well as supporting armed 
insurgent groups. 
For brands, the dangers are two-fold. 
Counterfeiting not only reduces the sales 
of legitimate goods – at the same time, it 
can also undermine a brand’s reputation 
by undermining hard-won customer 
relationships. Estimates suggest that 
10% of cigarettes
2
 and 25% of alcohol 
drinks are fake
3
, and that at least 24% 
of consumers have unwittingly bought 
counterfeit goods online
4
. In October 
2016 Apple reported that up to 90% of 
its products purchased via a well-known 
online marketplace are counterfeit. 
Staying one step ahead
Effective product authentication, from 
source to consumption, can combat 
this surge in illicit trade. In fact this is 
the most effective way to ensure that 
governments can collect tax revenue, 
consumers can make safe purchasing 
choices and businesses can protect 
their brands.
Overt and covert product authentication 
technology can take many forms, 
including secure features that can be 
embedded in a document or packaging 
to enable a business to track and 
trace a product anywhere in the world. 
Printed features, holograms and uniquely 
encoded materials known as taggants 
all have a part to play.
However, technology alone cannot 
combat counterfeiting. The political and 
regulatory environments must now get to 
grips with the challenges of globalisation 
and e-commerce. 
To succeed, governments must deploy 
the same three-pronged approach that 
led to cash counterfeiting becoming 
a relatively minor issue – for example, 
the Bank of England reports fewer 
than 0.006% of the UK banknotes 
in circulation today are fakes. 
That means combining technology and 
law enforcement with public education, 
ensuring that people can recognise 
fakes and understand the threat they 
pose to lives and economies. 
Counterfeiting will not go away. But the 
right joined-up approach, with multiple 
stakeholders working together to 
address issues such as cross border 
pricing and complex supply chains, 
will go a long way to ensuring that 
governments, brands and consumers 
stay one step ahead of the criminals.

THE CHALLENGE OF PRODUCT AUTHENTICATION 
PROTECTING REVENUES, BRANDS AND PEOPLE
10  De La Rue  Annual Report 2017
Illicit trade increases access to often cheaper 
tobacco products, which in turn fuels the tobacco 
epidemic and undermines existing tobacco control 
policies. In fact, eliminating illicit trade in tobacco 
is estimated to generate an annual tax windfall 
of US$ 31bn for governments.
Dr Vera da Costa e Silva
Head of the Convention Secretariat,  
The WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control Consumers in danger
Illicit trade is far from a mere inconvenience 
for consumers. It places them in genuine 
danger – from poisonous baby powder 
and cyanide in make-up to fake malaria 
tablets that are estimated to have caused 
the deaths of half a million people. 
Analysis by the World Health Organisation 
suggests that 30% of medicines on sale 
in some parts of Africa, Asia and Latin 
America are counterfeit.
Self-funding tax stamps
Tax stamps such as those often found 
on cigarettes provide strong physical 
tokens that help consumers choose 
authenticated products and governments 
to collect revenue. Such schemes can 
quickly become self-funding – in the 
Philippines, for example, the ‘sin tax’ has 
been very successful in raising tax revenue 
from tobacco and alcohol to fund the 
health service.

crisis?
It’s well known that investment in health, 
education and infrastructure will lead 
to an increase in GDP and the growth 
to which all countries aspire. But rarely 
governments can realistically make 
such investments without a reliable, 
demonstrable understanding of its 
population base. How many people... 
where do they live... what do they 
need in terms of healthcare, education 
and infrastructure? 
Civil registration is the anchor of an 
effective global ID system – the starting 
point that can build valuable, practical 
knowledge around the who, where, how 
and what. Yet, despite the best efforts of 
the World Bank and others, the UNHCR 
reports that one million births per week 
are not being registered. The task of 
ensuring that everybody on the planet 
has a legal and secure ID by 2030 – 
one of the UN Sustainable Development 
Goals – looks a distant goal.
It’s natural to think that as we move 
towards a digital world, technology 
will step in to enable births to be 
recorded and citizens validated with 
ease. Unfortunately, the infrastructure 
that drives internet communication 
is simply not up to the task – even in 
developed countries, system resilience 
is not sufficient to deliver total reliability. 
For example, the International Civil 
Aviation Organisation (ICAO), which sets 
the standards for the ID documentation 
required for air travel, recognises that 
even if a mobile network is running at 
99.95% availability, it’s likely to be down 
for over four hours per year. It’s not 
hard to imagine the chaos if immigration 
control was closed for several hours 
because digital passports couldn’t 
be checked.
Similarly, using iris recognition to verify ID 
in a refugee camp is rendered impractical 
once somebody leaves the camp and 
the technology is no longer available 
– no technology can quickly equate to 
no ID. So although the world is certainly 
on the path to a digital ID it will have to 
wait until the infrastructure is in place 
to support it. 
Co-existence of the physical 
and the digital
In the meantime, governments 
and citizens will continue to rely 
extensively on physical documentation 
for ID purposes. For example, the 
comprehensive and innovative security 
measures within physical passports 
cannot be replicated electronically – 
and this is unlikely to change in the 
near or mid term.
However, discussions around the future 
of ID remain focused almost exclusively 
on digital solutions. Yes, these will 
undoubtedly have a key part to play – 
for example, capturing birth data offline 
in remote areas and then uploading once 
connection is available can potentially 
transform civil registration. 
But we know from the growth in coins 
and banknotes that new technologies 
complement rather than replace the 
demand for physical items. What the 
world needs is a balanced debate on 
the physical and the digital, between 
policymakers and solution providers 
as well as between public bodies and 
private organisations. The solution is 
going to require a mix of innovation, trust 
and partnership, combining the best of 
the physical and digital worlds to create 
an effective ID system – and therefore 
drive growth and prosperity.

WHO ARE YOU? 
TOWARDS A DIGITAL ID
© Wingspan Productions Ltd 2013
12  De La Rue  Annual Report 2017
Data allow your political judgements to be based 
on fact, to the extent that numbers describe realities.
Hans Rosling
Statistician and Public Educator The challenge of sharing data
Significant barriers remain before we can 
welcome an era characterised by a single 
customer-centric view underpinned by data 
captured digitally. In the UK, for example, 
ID data is owned by the organisation – 
from the NHS to the DVLA and HMRC 
– not the individual. Encouraging and 
enabling these organisations to share 
data will be a major challenge. 
The changing nature of tokens
We’re all accustomed to using physical 
items (known in our industry as tokens) 
to prove we are who we say we are, 
whether in the form of a passport, ID card 
or birth certificate. However, the use of 
digital tokens can transform the customer 
experience and reduce costs – supporting 
online applications, accelerating verification 
and even enabling emergency replacement 
documents following loss or theft.
No address, no inclusion
An address enables people to exercise their 
rights and responsibilities. Governments can 
provide services and infrastructure investment 
when they know where their citizens 
live. However, around 75% of the world 
has an inadequate addressing system. 
New technologies and systems might help 
governments achieve UN SDG 16, building 
strong institutions. For instance, the location-
based service what3words has divided 
the world into a grid of 3m x 3m squares 
and assigned each one a unique three 
word address. This means that everyone, 
everywhere, can now have an address and 
therefore play their full part in society.

 Annual Report 2017  De La Rue  13 Our markets
We operate in three main markets – currency, identity and 
product authentication, all of which have strong prospects 
for long term sustainable growth. 
Currency market
The total amount of cash in circulation 
has been growing at c4% a year
1
 globally 
over the past decade and is expected to 
continue to increase at a similar rate in 
future years. GDP and population growth 
are the main drivers for cash growth. 
Most banknotes and the substrates on 
which they are printed are produced by 
state print works (SPWs) and state paper 
mills (SPMs) of the respective issuing 
countries. The rest of the demand is 
met by commercial banknote printers 
and paper makers. This situation has 
remained relatively stable over the 
past decade. 
While many customers buy finished 
banknotes from one supplier, some 
follow a multi-supplier model which 
involves disaggregating their note buying 
into individual components: substrate, 
security features and printing. 
Around 11% of the c172bn banknotes 
issued globally
2
 in 2016 were printed 
by a handful of commercial printers. 
De La Rue is the clear market leader, 
with 27% market share.
While the increase of cash in circulation 
drives growth in the commercial 
banknote printing market, the timing of 
orders can be unpredictable. The degree 
of uncertainty is exacerbated by overspill 
caused by the SPWs being unable to 
meet internal demand. Overspill orders 
typically account for 1% to 3% of the 
total banknote market and therefore have 
a noticeable effect on the commercial 
print and paper markets. 
Of the banknotes in circulation, 97% are 
printed on cotton-based paper with the 
remainder on next generation substrates 
such as polymer. Including overspill 
orders, around 45–50% of the substrate 
market is supplied by commercial 
paper or polymer manufacturers. 
The commercial paper market is highly 
competitive, with more than a dozen

14  De La Rue  Annual Report 2017 well-established suppliers. De La Rue 
is one of the top three commercial 
paper makers with market share ranging 
between 12% and 15%. In recent years, 
there has been a persistent overcapacity 
in the market due to some countries 
switching to insourcing. Although the 
gap between supply and demand has 
narrowed in the last 12 months, we 
expect oversupply to remain a feature 
of the market in the long run.
Polymer currently accounts for 3% of 
the substrate market. As central banks 
seek to reduce the ‘cost of cash’, 
polymer is becoming more popular due 
to its durability and greater security
3
. 
More economies are switching or 
considering switching paper banknotes 
to polymer notes, and we expect the 
market to double in size in the next five 
years
4
. We entered the market in 2012, 
with our polymer substrate Safeguard
®
. 
This has allowed us access to the entire 
substrate market, including the part of 
state manufacturing sector that was 
previously unavailable. 
While pricing in print and paper remains 
stable, customers are increasingly 
seeking to access the benefits of 
added-value security features such 
as threads and holograms and this 
is making the ownership of such 
innovations an attractive opportunity. 
Almost all countries buy security features 
or IP licences on the commercial market. 
Some 90% of the c172bn banknotes 
issued in 2016 incorporated security 
threads, while only 13% included 
features such as holographic patches 
and stripes. However, we believe growth 
in holographic features will accelerate as 
the polymer market expands. De La Rue 
is the third largest commercial supplier 
for security threads and the fourth largest 
for holographic features.

 According to the Bank of England’s study in 2013, 
polymer notes are more secure and last 2.5 times 
longer than cotton-based banknotes.

Identity market
Against a background of increasing 
population and greater globalisation, 
demand for identity products 
and services continues to rise as 
governments increasingly focus 
on improving border security and 
their citizens’ access to services. 
While physical tokens such as passports 
and ID cards are important, there is 
a growing emphasis on end-to-end 
solutions that combine secure tokens 
with systems and services. 
The global identity market, including 
passports, ID cards, and the associated 
digital solutions, is valued at around 
£3.7bn today and expected to grow at 
c6% a year
1
. Although many countries 
have in-house security print capabilities, 
many still choose to source printing 
or individual components from the 
commercial market. More than half 
of the identity market is available to 
commercial manufacturers.
With an annual growth of c8%, the 
passport market remains attractive, 
although market drivers and 
customer preferences are changing. 
Customers increasingly value security 
features and the systems and services 
surrounding the physical product. 
While we believe demand for physical 
passports will remain for the long 
term, the market is transitioning from 
Machine Readable Passports to 
chip-based ePassports. This further 
drives demand for full integration of 
end-to-end solutions.
Globally, around 100 countries have 
compulsory identity card schemes. 
The national ID market is expected to 
grow at 5%. Today, over 70% of the 
national IDs in circulation globally are 
chip-based. Technological advances 
in recent years have enabled new types 
of ID schemes, combining traditional 
ID functionality with payment methods.

16  De La Rue  Annual Report 2017 Product authentication market
Globally, the significant increase in 
counterfeit goods and illicit trade means 
that governments are losing billions of 
dollars in tax revenues. At the same time, 
legitimate businesses and brand owners 
are being undermined and consumer 
confidence is being eroded. 
Excisable fast moving consumer goods 
such as tobacco and alcohol are widely 
recognised to be among the most 
illegally traded products in the world. 
The UK Government estimated that 
£3.6bn was lost to illicit trade in alcohol 
and tobacco in 2014–15
1
. The need for 
protecting tax revenue, together with 
continuing changes to government policy 
worldwide, remain the key drivers for 
growth in the tax stamp market.
The rise of counterfeit goods, 
unauthorised production and sales 
channel diversion also means that 
businesses and brand owners are losing 
revenue and brand equity. The rapid 
growth of eCommerce and easy global 
shipping have exacerbated the problem, 
with 90% of online retailers having 
experienced up to a 10% loss of revenue 
due to online counterfeit sales
2
. In 2015, 
the total recorded loss due to fake goods 
amounted to $1.2bn. The global market 
for brand protection is forecast to grow 
at c9% a year, rising to $4.2bn in 2020
3
. 
Both the tax stamp and brand protection 
markets are highly fragmented, with most 
operators offering only partial solutions 
such as serialised labels and tamper-
evident packaging. However, there 
is a growing trend towards integrated, 
end-to-end solutions that provide 
a combination of highly secure labels 
and unique ID together with systems 
that can track, trace and authenticate 
products throughout the supply chain. 
As technologies advance and costs 
reduce, features such as printed 
electronics and RFID
4
 tags in packaging 
and labels are gaining popularity. 
Online shopping is also driving 
authentication through a touchpoint 
of consumer smartphones.

 Annual Report 2017  De La Rue  21 In May 2015, we announced a five year 
strategic plan to transform De La Rue from 
a banknote and passport manufacturer 
into a technology-led security product and 
service provider. The plan aims to deliver: 
• Better business mix
• Higher quality earnings
• Improved profitability
• Improved cash flow
• Better return on capital 
• High performing culture
1
  Address key issues 
In a constantly changing market, 
we must be more flexible and agile in 
managing our customer relationships, 
product pipelines and delivery. We face 
a number of risks that could have 
material impacts to the business. 
These include volatility of earnings which 
is caused by unpredictable demand in 
the banknote print and paper markets. 
Working with third party partners gives 
us added flexibility, helping reduce 
risk and manage surge in demand. 
At the same time, we use the insights 
and analytics we have gathered over 
decades to help our customers improve 
their forecasting. 
The banknote paper market has been 
oversupplied for a number of years and 
we expect this to continue. In the short 
term, cutting production costs and 
driving efficiency will help to maintain 
profitability. For the longer term, we 
continue to explore our strategic options.
We completed the sale of the 
underperforming Cash Processing 
Solutions business on 22 May 2016. 
2
  Driving efficiency
Driving down costs enables us to remain 
price competitive while protecting 
margins. We are working hard to improve 
manufacturing efficiency. In 2012, we 
launched our Operational Excellence 
programme to modernise banknote 
production and deliver continuous 
improvement through best practice. 
We successfully completed Level 2 
of the programme during the year.
To optimise our cost base, we are 
restructuring our manufacturing footprint 
to ensure it is aligned with long term 
average demand, while also benefiting 
from the greater flexibility delivered 
by changes in working practices. 
Launched in December 2015, this 
programme will complete in 2018/19 
and is expected to generate c£13m 
cash savings per year.

Watch the interview with CEO Martin Sutherland  
www.delarue.com/about-us/our-strategy We are also creating a leaner and 
more agile organisation. We began 
changing our systems and processes 
in 2015/16 and are now upgrading our 
finance and management information 
systems to increase efficiency and 
improve decision-making. We have 
also significantly improved a number 
of commercial processes which have 
shortened our timescales to submit 
bids and win new business.
3
  Diversifying revenues
More than half of the Group’s revenue is 
generated from Banknote Print and Paper. 
In order to diversify our revenue streams 
and benefit from a more balanced product 
mix, we have increased investment in 
areas with potential for high growth – such 
as Polymer and Identity Solutions – or high 
profitability, including Security Features 
and Product Authentication & Traceability 
(PA&T). We also aim to increase recurring 
revenues from software solutions and 
services. In addition, our focus on long 
term agreements will help to reduce 
volatility in banknote earnings caused 
primarily by unpredictable demand. 
To grow our sales pipeline, we are 
targeting direct sales of product 
components to state print works 
(SPWs), system integrators and other 
commercial printers. Our renewed focus 
on direct sales will not only increase 
our addressable market, but also even 
out the peaks and troughs we experience 
in orders for finished products.
We aim to maximise internal synergies 
by leveraging our existing products. 
In addition, we also aim to build stronger 
customer relationships via a network 
of new regional offices and a direct sales 
force, reducing reliance on third party 
partners. During the year, we set up sales 
hubs in Dubai and Miami and relocated 
sales staff to be closer to our customers 
in Africa and Asia. These changes will 
help us better understand customer 
needs, ensuring we offer the right 
products and services.
4
  Investing in innovation
Innovation drives product differentiation 
and is therefore the engine for our 
growth. We plan to double our 
investment in R&D in the years to 2020, 
prioritising product development in high 
growth and high margin businesses. 
Our product development programme 
is based on a number of technology 
platforms we have developed in material 
science. This approach allows us to 
maximise our technology know-how 
and create various platform-based 
applications for different products.
Innovation drives 
product differentiation 
and is therefore the 
engine for our growth.

business growth in the years to 2020 
and beyond. 
To encourage a high performing culture, 
we have implemented performance 
management and all employees now 
have a set of individual objectives aligned 
to Group strategy. 
To ensure that we have the right skills 
and capabilities to take our business 
forward, we have changed 50% of the 
senior leadership team over the last two 
years and continue to upgrade the skill 
set of our sales force. 
We continue to invest in extensive 
training, development and recognition 
programmes. In June 2016 we launched 
the second phase of the Leadership 
Development Programme. This focuses 
on developing the agility and capability 
to lead and inspire colleagues in a matrix 
organisation, and is helping to build a 
strong pipeline for succession planning.
Being ethical and always acting with 
integrity is at the heart of our ability 
to work with more than 140 countries, 
and we use regular ethics training and 
assessment to reinforce this approach 
across the company. 
We are proud to join the 12,000+ 
participants of the United Nations Global 
Compact (UNGC), a voluntary initiative 
based on the principles of human 
rights, labour rights, the environment 
and anti-corruption. These principles 
will guide how we function across our 
business and how we engage with our 
local communities. De La Rue has been 
helping to create inclusive, sustainable 
societies for 200 years and we will 
continue to do so. UNGC will provide 
us a framework to report our progress. 
Read more about our progress on pages 
42 to 49.
We aim to accelerate technology 
development through partnerships and 
acquisitions – and in December 2016 we 
acquired the US-based brand protection 
company, DuPont Authentication, 
for $25m. Not only does DuPont 
Authentication develop and own the 
highly specialised Lippmann holographic 
technology
1
, but it is one of the very 
few companies worldwide that can 
mass-produce 3D Lippmann holograms. 
In addition to our ongoing work to 
enhance our two proprietary software 
solutions – DLR Identify™ and DLR 
Certify™ – we have initiated a digital 
strategy with a number of initiatives, with 
the objective of modernising the business 
and improving competitiveness. 
The fact that around 40% of denominations 
in circulation globally and 60% of 
denominations issued in 2016/17 were 
designed by De La Rue endorses our 
design capability as one of our core 
strengths and differentiators. During the 
year, we have changed our approach 
to increase interaction between the design 
team and customers.
1
 Lippmann holographic technology, also called 3D 
holographic, is a type of hologram that projects volume or 
a 3D image of the object. Compared with the conventional 
embossed holograms which produce colourful 2D images, 
it requires advanced replication technology. Only a 
handful of companies worldwide are capable of producing 
3D holograms. 
Cash Supply Chain 
Bank of England £5 note design 
We were exceptionally proud to work in 
partnership with the Bank of England on the 
ground-breaking new £5 note. We collaborated 
with the Bank and its other suppliers to create 
the highly secure and iconic new design, which 
we are now printing. We are also working closely 
with the Bank on the designs for the new £10 
and £20 notes and look forward to their issue 
in the near future.

24  De La Rue  Annual Report 2017 Reclassification of results between 
Product Authentication & Traceability 
and Identity Solutions
Historically the results of one of the 
Group’s manufacturing sites have been 
included in the PA&T segment as this 
segment represented the majority of its 
business. However, due to growth in 
IDS business within this site, we have 
started reviewing information including 
the results of this site split between 
IDS and PA&T. In order to align the 
Group’s external reporting segments 
to the information reviewed internally, 
the results of this site have been split in 
the current year between the IDS and 
PA&T segment. The 2015/16 figures have 
also been adjusted for comparability. 
See note 1 in the accounts for 
further details.
Currency 
Currency comprises Banknote Print, 
Banknote Paper, Polymer, and 
Security Features. Each business line 
faces different market dynamics and 
growth prospects. 
Banknote Print 
While overall volumes of cash are 
growing globally at c4% a year, 
issuances and orders of cash remain 
lumpy. This creates unpredictability in 
our production schedule and, in turn, 
profitability. We aim to reduce this 
unpredictability by optimising production 
capacity and by using outsourcing to 
create extra flexibility to deal with surge 
in demand. 
Our manufacturing footprint restructuring 
programme, designed to optimise 
our capacity, has now completed its 
first phase. Two print lines have been 
decommissioned in Malta and machine 
upgrades in other sites are going to plan. 
In November 2016, we refined the plan 
to improve our blend of outsourcing and 
in-house production, and this led to a 
decision to retain the remaining banknote 
print line in Malta. The plan to deliver 
c£13m annual cost savings from FY18/19 
remains unchanged, although some 
of these savings are expected to be 
reinvested in the business.
Operational review
Our 2020 Strategic Plan has a dual 
focus. Based on the market dynamics 
of each business line, we have identified 
two different strategic priorities: 
Invest and Build 
Invest in the business lines that are 
exposed to higher growth markets and 
enhance our capabilities in order to deliver 
sustainable growth, specifically Polymer, 
Security Features, Identity Solutions (IDS), 
and Product Authentication & Traceability 
(PA&T).
Optimise and Flex 
Drive efficiency and flexibility in the 
business lines that are facing markets 
with unpredictability or slower growth, 
specifically Banknote Print and 
Banknote Paper.
Product Authentication 
DuPont Authentication 
In line with our 2020 Strategic Plan, our acquisition 
of DuPont Authentication for $25m in January 
2017 has given us access to new capabilities. 
DuPont Authentication produces photopolymer 
holographic films and 3D holograms based on 
the highly specialised Lippmann technology. 
Headquartered in Utah, USA and with operations 
in Delaware, the business has a well-established 
global customer base in brand protection and 
identity authentication. Its flagship product, Izon
®
, 
is used on a number of globally recognised 
brands, such as Lenovo and Brother, as well 
as on one of the world’s most secure passports.

Strategic report Corporate governance Accounts
 Annual Report 2017  De La Rue  25 We are focusing on driving direct 
sales to SPWs in order to increase 
machine utilisation. 
During the year, we launched a cost 
reduction programme which aims to 
reduce the spoilage rate and improve 
throughput. While total volume grew by 
18%, unit production cost also increased 
due to the increased cost of imported 
raw materials such as cotton. 
In the meantime, we continue to engage 
in complex and constructive dialogue 
with a number of paper-makers in 
order to identify a long term solution 
for the business. 
Polymer 
This business has gained significant 
traction since the launch of our polymer 
substrate, Safeguard
®,
 in 2012. Today, 
as the only integrated polymer provider, 
we are well positioned to achieve 
further growth.
We aim to grow our market share by 
targeting existing polymer customers 
as well as paper and coin customers 
looking to switch to polymer. In 2016/17 , 
we increased our production volumes 
from 100 tonnes to 380 tonnes. 
In August, we agreed to enter into a joint 
venture that would see the Government 
of Kenya acquire a 40% interest in our 
wholly-owned Kenyan subsidiary for 
£5.0m. This will further strengthen our 
ties with the country and secure our 
position as a supply hub of currency 
and security solutions in East Africa. 
We expect this to complete in the current 
financial year.
We seek to build outsourcing partnerships 
in banknote print to provide added 
flexibility, reduce risk and manage surge 
demand. At the same time, we aim to 
increase earnings visibility through LTAs 
with customers. We also look to smooth 
demand by helping our customers improve 
their cash requirement forecasting. In May 
2017 , we launched DLR Analytics™ – a 
software solution that helps central banks 
manage their cash cycle by drawing on 
insights and intelligence from the collected 
data and our database. It is currently 
piloted with 26 customers.
Banknote Paper 
Although demand for banknote paper 
has increased in recent months, 
we believe that the long term market 
dynamics remain unchanged. 
The number of Safeguard
®
 customers 
reached 15, representing c40% of total 
polymer banknote issuers. We also won 
our first coin-to-note customer. 
We continue to invest in developing 
security features suitable for both 
polymer and paper substrates to 
increase differentiation. For customers 
who issue both polymer and paper notes 
in different denominations, substrate 
agnostic features provide a degree 
of consistency which helps to build 
public confidence. 
We are also working closely with 
suppliers to reduce production 
costs, an initiative that will combine 
with our increased scale to further 
improve profitability.
Security Features 
As security features tend to last the 
lifetime of the banknote design, they 
provide a reliable revenue stream. 
The most versatile product in our 
portfolio, security features can be applied 
across all other product lines. 
We aim to grow revenue by cross-selling 
banknote features to IDS and PA&T 
customers. At the same time, our 50%+

26  De La Rue  Annual Report 2017 market share in commercial banknote 
design provides an ideal platform to 
increase direct sales of security features 
to SPWs. 
A rolling programme of investments 
in R&D maintains our competitiveness 
and creates high barriers to market 
entry. In September 2016, we launched 
holographic foil on polymer with the 
issue of the Gibraltar £100 note – and 
holographic technology is also being 
applied to laminate features for the ID 
market. We launched six new products 
in May 2017, including four security 
features that were developed using 
our existing technologies.
We aim to accelerate technology 
development through partnerships 
and bolt-on acquisitions, such as the 
purchase of the Lippmann technology. 
While its main applications are 
authentication labels and anti-tampering 
packaging, this 3D hologram technology 
can also be applied to identity 
documents and, with modification, 
to banknotes. 
Overall, the Currency business benefited 
from an improved mix in Banknote Print 
and higher volumes in Banknote Paper, 
which partially offset the impact of the 
security features contract that concluded 
in the prior year. Revenue fell by 1% year 
on year to £350.6m (2015/16: £353.3m). 
The lower revenue and change in sales 
mix resulted in a 9% decline in adjusted 
operating profit.
We achieved good volumes in Banknote 
Print of 7.1bn notes (2015/16: 7.1bn) in 
the year despite the decommissioning 
of two print lines as part of the 
footprint restructuring programme. 
This demonstrated not only our sales 
capability, but also the flexibility of 
our manufacturing capacity following 
the restructuring.
Banknote Paper volumes increased by 
18% to 11,800 tonnes (2015/16: 10,000 
tonnes), primarily driven by stronger 
external sales. Prices of raw materials 
such as cotton and ink have increased 
substantially in recent months and are 
expected to remain high throughout the 
coming year. 
Polymer almost quadrupled in volume to 
380 tonnes in the year, demonstrating 
continuing good momentum. Margins are 
expected to improve over time as we 
continue to reduce production costs and 
build scale.
Security features were adversely 
impacted by the material contract which 
concluded in the prior year. Both revenue 
and operating profit were lower than 
the prior year. However, underlying 
performance, i.e. excluding the impact 
of the concluded contract, was 
encouraging. We launched four new 
features in May 2017 – TrueImage™, 
TextMark™, enhanced Gemini™, 
Kinetic StarChrome
®
 Portrait – further 
strengthening our product portfolio.
At the year end the 12 month order 
book for Currency including estimated 
call-off orders for contracts was £311m 
(2015/16: £278m).
Identity Systems 
We are the world’s largest commercial 
passport producer, with 32% market 
share by volume. At the same time, 
we are looking to grow digital and 
service revenues via two separate 
initiatives: firstly, by selling more to 
existing customers, using our end-to-
end identity management solution, DLR 
Identify™, to help them migrate from 
MRP to ePassport; and secondly, by 
offering full eBorder solutions including 
biometrics verification and border 
control via partnerships. In addition, 
we plan to re-enter the national ID market 
by leveraging our relationships with 
existing customers.
In 2016/17, we won a new multi-year 
contract, renewed three service contracts 
and gained three new customers for 
passport books. We also continued to 
drive direct sales of individual passport 
components, such as passport paper 
and laminate, to SPWs and other 
commercial operators. 
In June 2016, we launched DLR 
Identify™ CRVS
2
 – an extension of DLR 
Identify™, which enables governments 
to record life events of their citizens 
such as births, deaths and marriages. 
These data establish the rights of 
individuals to services such as education 
and health care while also enabling 
governments to plan ahead with 
greater confidence.
Identity Solutions 
Kenya ePassport 
Building on a long term partnership, we have 
recently delivered a new ePassport solution and 
document with polycarbonate bio-data page for 
the Republic of Kenya. Part of the Government’s 
Vision 2030 programme, this complete solution 
means that Kenya is the first member of the East 
African Community to launch a fully compliant 
ePassport that meets both international and 
regional specifications.

28  De La Rue  Annual Report 2017 2
 Civil Registration, Vital Statistics. 
As part of the manufacturing footprint 
restructuring programme, we have 
created a centre of excellence for identity 
and security print in Malta, which includes 
the installation of a new polycarbonate 
line. This new capability has further 
strengthened our product offering 
for both passport and national ID. 
Identity Solutions performed well in the 
year. Revenue grew by 5% to £80.6m 
(2015/16: £76.5m), with an improved 
margin of 14.1% (2015/16: 10.8%) from 
better mix of orders. This reflected 
an increased proportion of revenues 
from software and services, as well 
as increased focus on component 
sales. Adjusted operating profit in the 
period increased by 37% to £11.4m 
(2015/16: £8.3m). 
We continue to invest in skills and 
capabilities. During the year, we more 
than doubled our R&D investment 
and added seven new sales people. 
This increase in investment was paid 
for by overhead reduction and efficiency 
in the Currency business.
Product Authentication 
& Traceability 
Product Authentication & Traceability 
(PA&T) operates in two main markets: 
tax revenue protection for governments; 
and brand protection for private 
enterprises. We aim to grow recurring 
revenues in both markets by increasing 
solution sales.
As one of the largest tax stamp 
providers, we continue to strengthen 
our position by leveraging existing 
relationships and expanding our offering 
with service and digital solutions. 
Cameroon became the first customer for 
our track and trace system DLR Certify™ 
during the year, and we are now pursuing 
a number of other opportunities.
We have renewed our focus on the 
fast growing but fragmented enterprise 
brand protection market. Our objective 
is to expand by targeting international 
brands with complex supply chains 
and distribution networks which require 
close monitoring. We also aim to 
accelerate growth through partnerships 
and acquisitions. For example, DuPont 
Authentication’s flagship product Izon
®
 
is recognised as the premier anti-
counterfeiting technology for brand 
protection and is used on a number 
of well-known brands such as Lenovo 
and Brother. 
Furthermore, we are driving direct 
sales of components, such as 
security labels and security features 
IP licensing, to system integrators 
and packaging companies.
PA&T delivered an excellent performance 
in the year. Revenue increased by 20% 
to £34.6m (2015/16: £28.8m), driven 
by growth in tax revenue protection. 
The segment benefited from lower 
production cost, which was partly 
offset by increased investment in R&D 
and sales. Adjusted operating profit 
in the period was up 29% to £9.0m 
(2015/16: £7.0m).
We completed the acquisition of 
DuPont Authentication on 6 January 
2017. Integration of the business was 
completed in April 2017. Excluding the 
acquisition, revenue in the segment grew 
by 13% and adjusted operating profit 
was up 24%.

How we manage our principal risks and uncertainties
How we manage risk 
Risk management is the responsibility 
of the Board, supported by the Risk 
Committee which comprises members 
of our Executive Leadership Team. 
The Risk Committee is accountable for 
identifying, mitigating and managing risk. 
Further details about the Committee 
can be found on page 69. We have 
a formal risk identification process 
which evaluates and manages our 
significant risks in accordance with 
the requirements of the UK Corporate 
Governance Code. Our Group risk 
register identifies the risks, their potential 
impact and likelihood of occurrence, 
and the key controls and management 
processes we have established to 
mitigate these risks.
The Risk Committee meets twice a year to 
review risk management and monitor the 
status of key risks as well as the actions 
we have taken to address these at both 
Group and functional level. Any material 
changes to risk are highlighted at the 
monthly Executive Leadership Team 
meetings, while the Audit Committee 
also  reviews the Group’s risk report.
Management is responsible for 
implementing and maintaining controls, 
which have been designed to manage 
rather than eliminate risk. These controls 
can only provide reasonable but not 
absolute assurance against material 
misstatement or loss. See page 62 
for further information regarding 
internal controls.
Principal risks and uncertainties
The following pages set out the principal 
risks and uncertainties that could 
crystallise over the next three years. 
The Board has undertaken a robust 
risk assessment to identify these risks, 
which are listed in order of potential 
impact. There may be other risks that 
we currently believe to be immaterial. 
These could become material, either 
individually or simultaneously, and 
significantly affect our business and 
financial results. We have modelled 
potential scenarios of these risks 
crystallising to support the disclosures 
in the Viability Statement. See page 37 
for further details. Due to the nature of 
risk, the mitigating factors stated cannot 
be viewed as assurance that the actions 
taken or planned will be wholly effective.

32  De La Rue  Annual Report 2017 Risk appetite
The Board has reviewed our principal 
risks and considered whether they 
reflect an acceptable level of risk. 
Where this is not the case, the 
Board has also considered what 
further investment is being made 
to reduce the likelihood and potential 
impact of the risk. The Board either 
approves the level of risk being taken, 
or requires management to reduce 
the risk exposure. 
For core areas of the business, the Board 
uses a number of methods to ensure 
that management operates within an 
accepted risk appetite. These include 
delegated authority levels, the approval 
of specific policies and procedures and 
the approval of the annual insurance 
programme. The Board receives 
regular feedback on the degree 
to which management is operating 
within acceptable risk tolerances.
This feedback includes regular 
operational and financial management 
reports, internal audit reports, external 
audit reporting and any reports to the 
whistle blowing hotline. All members 
of the Executive Leadership Team 
have individual ownership for 
one or more of the principal risks. 
Management of those risks forms 
part of their personal objectives.

Breach of legal  
and regulatory  
requirements
It is possible that our employees 
or overseas representatives, 
either individually or in collusion 
with others, could act in 
contravention of our stringent 
requirements in relation 
to bribery and corruption, 
anti‑competitive behaviours 
and management of third party 
partners (TPPs).
Major reputational 
and financial damage.
We are accredited to the Banknote Ethics Initiative, 
which provides governments and central banks 
with assurance regarding our ethical standards 
and business practices.
Our commitment to ethical standards is 
articulated in the Code of Business Principles. 
This is supported by underlying policies which are 
reviewed regularly and enforced robustly. Where 
necessary, non‑compliances is dealt with through 
disciplinary procedures.
We have a particular focus on raising awareness 
as well as training on anti‑ bribery and corruption, 
and competition law. Our policies and processes 
are independently audited.
Our process for the appointment, management 
and remuneration of TPPs operates independently 
of the sales function. The behaviours of TPPs are 
strictly monitored and the TPP process is overseen 
by the General Counsel and Company Secretary, 
who reports directly to the Board on these matters.
Our whistle blowing policy and associated procedures 
are integral aspects of the compliance framework.

Failure to win 
or renew a 
material contract
While we operate globally and 
have a diversified geographic, 
product and customer profile, 
we rely heavily on a small 
number of medium and longer 
term material contracts.
Failure to win or 
renew a key contract 
could restrict growth 
opportunities and 
have a material 
impact on our 
financial performance 
and reputation.
Our track record of delivering product innovation 
and our commitment to quality, combined with 
a commercial approach to tendering, means 
we are well positioned to win or renew strategic 
or significant contracts. 
We are focused on retaining key contracts, as and 
when they fall due for renewal, and on winning 
new opportunities as they arise.

Pension  
fund deficit
The Group’s UK defined benefit 
pension scheme (the Scheme) 
is in deficit. As at 25 March 
2017 the post‑tax deficit as 
accounted for under IAS 19 
was £196.7m (26 March 2016: 
£178.4m).
We have created a 
joint working group 
with the pension 
trustees to proactively 
manage our pension 
obligations. If at 
the next triennual 
valuation in 2018 
the deficit increases 
further under 
actuarial valuation, 
the future cash flow 
commitments may 
put future capital 
investment and 
dividends at risk. 
We are working with the pension trustees 
to explore methods of improving the return 
of the Scheme’s assets and reducing 
the Scheme’s liabilities.

Failure to 
maintain 
and exploit 
competitive and 
technologically 
advanced 
products 
and services
We operate in competitive 
markets. Our products and 
services are characterised by 
continually evolving industry 
standards and changing 
technology, driven by the 
demands of our customers. 
Longer term threats could 
include the growth of 
eCommerce, the emergence 
of cashless societies and lower 
barriers to manufacturing.
Failure to maintain 
and exploit technical 
innovation and 
intellectual property 
may result in lower 
demand, loss of 
market share and 
lower margins.
We maintain sustained levels of investment in 
research and development to ensure a steady 
flow of ideas into our innovation pipeline. Our 
product roadmaps are designed to meet our 
customers’ needs. Our materials science expertise 
and software science team are centralised in 
the UK. These teams follow defined technology 
management processes, which include regular 
pipeline and portfolio reviews.
We continue to invest in new technologies to enable 
us to advance our R&D capabilities, and have 
increased our focus on digital technologies since 
the strategy review in 2015.
We aim to double our R&D investment in the 
five years to 2020.

Failure to adopt 
performance 
driven culture
In order to ensure our continued 
success and growth, we carried 
out an internal organisational 
redesign in 2015/16. The 
focus for this programme is 
to achieve sustained cultural 
change in order to enable us 
to adapt to a rapidly changing 
market environment.
Without a change in 
our culture, we may 
not be able to execute 
the strategy laid out 
in May 2015.
In 2016/17 we delivered leadership training 
to build on the achievements of the 2015/16 
strategic leadership skills programme. The new 
training focused on cross‑ functional working, 
especially in the areas of influencing and managing 
competing interests. 
We have set specific targets for performance 
appraisal and employee engagement. The results of 
the employee engagement survey in late 2016 have 
been cascaded throughout the business, and we 
have developed appropriate response plans. 
The strategic plan envisaged a three year 
programme of training, communication and 
recruitment to fill capability gaps. This plan is 
on track – and the outcome is expected to be a 
change in behaviours and skills that will enable us 
to be a more dynamic, agile and high performing 
organisation.

Failure to 
secure strategic 
partnerships 
to address 
key issues
Our ability to address the key 
issues of volatile demand in 
banknotes and over capacity in 
the paper business depend on 
third party agreements. 
The predictability 
of future revenue 
streams and our ability 
to increase the return 
on capital employed 
may be compromised. 
If third party agreements cannot be concluded, 
we will continue to use existing strategic initiatives 
to mitigate this risk. These are: continue to drive 
efficiency; diversify revenues; innovate; and 
strengthen the overall financial position of the 
Group.

Information  
security risk
The confidentiality and integrity 
of our customer, employee 
and business data could be 
affected by factors that include 
human error, ineffective design 
or operation of key data security 
controls, or by the breakdown 
of IT control processes.
Any compromise 
in the confidentiality 
of information could 
impact our reputation 
with current and 
potential customers.
Our corporate information systems are accredited 
to the ISO27001 Information Security standard.
We maintain a strict control environment to enforce 
disciplined information security practices and 
behaviours. A number of key technical controls 
are in place to manage this risk, including network 
segregation, access restrictions, system monitoring, 
security reviews and vulnerability assessments of 
infrastructure and applications.
We regularly review all aspects of information 
security arrangements, and our employees 
undertake mandatory information security 
e‑ learning.

Loss of a key site A number of our manufacturing 
sites are exposed to business 
interruption risks.
The total loss of any 
one of these key sites 
could have a major 
financial impact, 
particularly where the 
site represents a single 
source of supply.
Our head office and the banknote production 
operations in Debden, UK are both accredited to 
the ISO22301:2012 Business Continuity standard. 
We maintain a high degree of interoperability 
across our banknote production and security 
printing sites. We aim to minimise risk by adopting 
the highest standards of risk engineering 
in our production processes. 
In recognition of our customers’ increasingly high 
requirements regarding business continuity, we 
continue to enhance the resilience of our major 
facilities in line with the ISO standard.

Health, safety  
or environmental 
failure
All of our activities are subject 
to extensive internal health, 
safety and environmental (HSE) 
procedures, processes and 
controls. Nevertheless, there is 
a risk that any failure of an HSE 
management process could 
result in a serious incident.
Failure of an HSE 
management process 
could lead to a 
serious injury or an 
environmental breach.
At all major facilities, we have a robust HSE 
management system which is internally audited 
and certified to the OHSAS18001 and ISO14001 
standards.
All of our activities are subject to extensive internal 
HSE procedures, processes and controls.
The Group HSE Committee regularly reviews 
HSE performance. This is also monitored by the 
Chief Operating Officer’s leadership team and 
reported to the Board monthly.
Each manufacturing facility has clear HSE action 
plans which are prioritised, monitored and subject 
to review by local senior management to ensure 
that health and safety standards are maintained.

Quality 
management 
failure
Each of our contracts has a 
unique specification on product 
quality and delivery. Some 
of these contracts demand 
a high degree of technical 
specification.
A shortfall in quality 
management 
may expose us to 
additional cost to 
remake as well as 
to any associated 
warranty costs.
We operate an established quality management 
system across all production sites. All major sites 
are certified to ISO9001 quality management 
standards.
In 2012, we introduced an Operational Excellence 
programme to further drive continuous 
improvement across our manufacturing sites. 
This programme is well established and continues 
to deliver operational enhancements. 
2
Supply chain 
failure
We have close trading 
relationships with a number 
of key suppliers, including 
unique producers of 
specialised components 
that we incorporate into 
our finished products.
Failure of a key 
supplier, the inability 
to source critical 
materials or poor 
supplier performance 
in terms of quality or 
delivery could disrupt 
our supply and ability 
to deliver on time 
and in full.
Our exposure is reduced because we source many 
components from within our own organisation.
Where we rely on external supply, we have 
established procedures for identifying possible 
risks for each supplier. Key suppliers are managed 
through a supplier relationship management 
programme. This incorporates checks on their 
financial strength and their ability to deliver to our 
quality standards and security, as well as their 
business continuity arrangements. Key suppliers 
are audited on a rotational basis.
As a contingency, alternative suppliers are 
pre‑qualified wherever possible and where 
necessary we retain higher levels of stocks.

Unpredictability 
in the timing and 
size of substantial 
contract awards 
Political and other factors can 
delay government procurement 
decisions for sensitive 
products such as banknotes 
and passports.
The timing and size 
of contract awards 
is often uncertain. 
Delays lead to volatility 
in our order book and 
financial performance.
We maintain close and regular contact with 
customers so that any changes in timing and 
requirements are recognised promptly.
We monitor our sales activity, order pipeline 
and forward order book to optimise production 
planning and ensure that delivery to customers 
is on time and in full.
We also monitor any delays in order confirmation 
on a weekly basis. This enables us to maintain 
flexibility in the supply chain and to accommodate 
any changes to production planning.
To minimise future unpredictability, we proactively 
pursue longer term commitments from customers. 
We also aim to grow recurring revenues by 
expanding our digital and service offerings.

Product security Loss of product or high 
security components from a 
manufacturing site could occur 
as a result of negligence or 
theft. Loss of product while 
in transit, particularly during 
transhipment, through the failure 
of freight companies or through 
the loss of an aircraft or vessel 
as a result of an accident or 
natural disaster, is also possible.
Any loss of product 
or high security 
components has the 
potential to cause 
reputational and 
financial damage. In 
certain circumstances, 
customer contracts 
may mean that we are 
liable for those losses.
We have robust physical security and materials 
control procedures at our production sites, which 
reduce the risk of inadvertent loss or theft during 
manufacturing. We apply stringent operational 
procedures – and use carefully selected carriers 
and personnel – to handle movements of security 
materials between our sites and onward delivery 
to customers. All movements are risk managed 
and monitored globally on a 24/7 basis. We also 
maintain a comprehensive global insurance 
programme.

Outlook
Political risk A number of the countries 
that we sell to have a history of 
unstable government or conflict. 
There is an ongoing risk that 
orders may be unexpectedly 
cancelled or cannot be 
fulfilled, that outstanding 
debts do not get paid, or that 
performance guarantees do 
not get cancelled because of 
local political issues, which 
could lead to financial loss.
Losses from cancelled 
orders and non‑ 
payment of debt could 
lead to a reduction 
in operating profit. 
Where performance 
guarantees remain 
outstanding, credit 
facilities will be tied‑ 
up, restricting our 
ability to utilise such 
facilities to support 
new contracts 
or investment.
We assess the overall risk of all contracts pre‑ tender, including credit risk. We have defined 
approval limits for management and the Board 
regarding material contracts. These are based 
on risk as well as contract size. 
In higher risk situations, we negotiate payment 
terms and request substantial down‑ payments, 
and in 2016/17 negotiated credit insurance from 
UK Export Finance.
All performance guarantees are approved by the 
treasury department prior to contract signature.
As a result of the mitigations in place, the exposure 
to this risk has decreased sufficiently for the Board 
to consider that it is not currently a principal risk. 
Risks and uncertainties where the net impact has increased since prior year, and which 
are now considered principal risks and uncertainties.
The Board has decided, after review by the Audit Committee, that the continuing pension fund deficit and the challenges 
experienced in concluding strategic partnerships to address key issues now constitute principal risks and uncertainties 
in achieving the Group’s strategic objectives.

36  De La Rue  Annual Report 2017 Viability statement
The Directors have considered the longer term viability of De La Rue plc in line with the recommendations under 
the UK Corporate Governance Code.
Period of review
The Directors have considered the longer term viability 
of De La Rue plc in line with the recommendations under 
the UK Corporate Governance Code.
While the Group has a five year strategic planning horizon, 
the financial performance of the Group is inherently less 
predictable in years four and five because good visibility 
of the order book is over a shorter term horizon. Therefore, 
the Directors believe that an appropriate period to consider 
the Group’s viability is over three years. 
In assessing the viability of the Group, the Directors have 
reviewed the principal risks as set out in pages 33 to 36 
and considered foreseeable scenarios of one or more of the 
principal risks crystallising in the same time period in the 
context of its strategic plan. 
Eight of the principal risks were modelled to test the impact 
on the viability of the Group. The Directors have focused on 
principal risks that could more plausibly occur and result in 
the Group’s future operational results, financial condition and 
future prospects to differ materially from current expectations. 
These include the ability to maintain a dividend, meet current 
investment plans, and comply with liquidity ratios. 
Scenarios that the Directors view as implausible (or outside 
the Group’s control, such as a terrorist attack or an event 
of nature) have not been modelled, nor have all potential 
mitigating responses. The Directors have assumed that the 
current revolving credit facility remains in place with the same 
covenant requirements through to December 2021. 
Even with all the principal risks above crystallising in a plausible 
combination, the Group’s credit facilities were not exhausted. 
The Board also considered a reverse stress test; the extent 
of cash the Group would have to lose against its strategic plan 
forecast in order to breach its net debt/EBITDA and interest 
cover covenants. 
The result of reviewing plausible scenarios and the reverse 
stress test is that the Directors have a reasonable expectation 
that the Group is viable and will be able to meet its obligations 
as they fall due up to March 2020. 
Strategic report Corporate governance Accounts
 Annual Report 2017  De La Rue  37 The Group has delivered a good 
performance this year, with full year 
adjusted operating profit* of £70.7m 
(2015/16: £70.4m). We also completed 
our first acquisition in 14 years with the 
purchase of DuPont Authentication Inc 
(subsequently renamed as De La Rue 
Authentication Solutions) on 6 January 2017 . 
We are pleased with the performance 
of this business post acquisition. 
This section is for continuing operations 
only unless otherwise stated.
Financial performance
Revenue and profit
Group revenue was £461.7m, 
representing a 2% increase over the prior 
year (2015/16: £454.5m), resulting in 
good growth in the Identity Solutions and 
Product Authentication and Traceability 
product lines. Adjusted operating 
profit* at £70.7m was marginally higher 
than the prior year as higher adjusted 
operating profit generated by the Identity 
Solutions and Product Authentication 
and Traceability product lines was offset 
by lower adjusted operating profit from 
the Currency business, partly due to 
the conclusion of a material contract 
in December 2015. 
Adjusted EBITDA* was £97.4m 
(2015/16: £96.4m). 
Operating profit on an IFRS basis 
was higher than last year at £70.2m, 
compared to £66.8m in 2015/16 
due to lower exceptional charges 
(see commentary below for further 
details on exceptional items). 
Adjusted profit before tax* was 
consistent with the prior year at £58.7m 
(2015/16: £58.5m), resulting from adjusted 
operating profits which were flat on the 
prior year and marginally lower net finance 
charges at £4.6m (2015/16: £4.8m), and 
a higher IAS 19 related finance cost of 
£7.4m (2016/15: £7.1m). Profit before 
tax on an IFRS basis was £58.2m 
(2015/16: £54.9m) and was higher than 
last year due to a lower net charge for 
exceptional items at £0.4m compared 
to £3.6m in 2015/16.

Financial review
* This is a non‑ IFRS measure. See further explanations and reconciliations to the 
comparable IFRS measure on pages 153 to 154.
38  De La Rue  Annual Report 2017 Profit from continuing operations on an 
IFRS basis was £49.5m compared to 
£48.6m in the prior year as the impact 
of lower net charges for exceptional items 
was partly offset by a higher tax charge. 
Finance charge
The Group’s net interest charge was 
£4.6m, a slight decrease on the prior 
year (2015/16: £4.8m). The IAS 19 
related finance cost, which represents 
the difference between the interest on 
pension liabilities and assets, was £7.4m 
(2015/16: £7.1m). 
Exceptional items
During the period, exceptional net 
charges on continuing operations 
amounted to £0.4m, compared to £3.6m 
in 2015/16.
Exceptional net charges comprise: site 
relocation and restructuring costs of 
£0.2m (2015/16: £9.2m); gains on sale 
of land of £0.2m (2015/16: £9.5m); a 
credit relating to the release of warranty 
provisions of £0.5m (2015/16: credit of 
£1.3m); asset impairment charges of £nil 
(2015/16: £5.2m) and acquisition related 
costs of £0.9m (2015/16: £nil). 
Site relocation and restructuring costs 
were lower in 2016/17. 
The significant gain on sale of land in 
2015/16 related to the sale of surplus 
land in Overton which generated a profit 
of £9.5m. A few small land assets were 
sold in the current year. 
Costs of £0.9m have been incurred 
following the acquisition of 
De La Rue Authentication Solutions Inc. 
This included £0.5m of professional 
advisor fees in addition to the non‑ cash 
unwind of the fair value adjustment 
recorded against inventory of £0.4m. 
See note 4 in the accounts for 
further details.
Taxation
The net tax charge for the year was 
£8.7m (2015/16: £6.3m). The effective 
tax rate before exceptional items was 
15.8% (2015/16: 14.7%). The tax rate was 
lower in 2015/16 due to a non‑ recurring 
tax benefit arising on the release of 
a provision. 
Net tax credits relating to exceptional 
items, on continuing operations, arising 
in the period were £0.6m (2015/16 
£2.3m).
Earnings per share
Adjusted basic earnings per share* was 
47.1p compared to 48.1p in 2015/16. 
The decrease was caused by a higher 
tax charge in the current year.
Reported basic earnings per share on 
an IFRS basis was 47.2p, higher than the 
prior year (2015/16: 46.8p) due to lower 
net exceptional charges.
Loss from discontinued operations
The loss from discontinued operations 
in the year was £8.0m, including two 
months of Cash Processing Solutions’ 
trading loss prior to disposal of £2.2m 
and exceptional charges net of tax 
of £5.8m.
Dividend
The Board is recommending a final 
dividend of 16.7p per share (2015/16:  
16.7p per share). Together with the 
interim dividend paid in January 2017 
of 8.3p per share, this will give a total 
dividend for the year of 25.0p per 
share (2015/16: 25.0p per share). 
Subject to approval by shareholders, 
the final dividend will be paid on 3 August 
2017 to shareholders on the register 
on 30 June 2017. 
Financial position
Cash flow and borrowings
Cash generated from operating activities 
was £64.3m (9% higher than the prior 
year (2015/16: £58.9m)), including a £5m 
inflow relating to discontinued operations. 
There was an adverse working capital 
movement in the current year due to 
the timing of cash receipts from debtors 
because of a high level of sales in the last 
month of the year and lower advanced 
payments compared to the prior year. 
Cash generated from operating activities 
included £3.3m (2015/16: £12.5m) of 
payments relating to exceptional items. 
Cash conversion ratio was 114% 
(2015/16: 160%). Cash conversion is 
the ratio of adjusted operating profit 
plus depreciation, amortisation and 
the movement in working capital over 
adjusted operating profits. 
The cash conversion ratio was adverse 
to the prior year due to the movement 
in working capital.
Net debt increased by £14.8m to 
£120.9m (2016/17: £106.1m) primarily 
due to the $25m acquisition of De La Rue 
Authentication Solutions Inc.
The Group utilises a £250.0m revolving 
credit facility and has operated well 
within the key financial covenants. 
On 27 April 2017, the Group extended 
the maturity date of this facility by two 
years to December 2021. It is subject 
to the same financial covenants which 
require that the ratio of EBIT to net 
interest payable be greater than four 
times and the net debt to EBITDA ratio 
be less than three times. At the period 
end the specific covenant tests were as 
follows: EBIT/net interest payable of 16.1 
times, net debt/EBITDA of 1.27 times.
Strategic report Corporate governance Accounts
 Annual Report 2017  De La Rue  39 Working capital
Net trade receivables were £89.5m, 
up from £77.6m in the prior year, due 
to strong sales in the last quarter 
of 2017/16. 
Inventories were broadly similar to last 
year, but lower than the level seen at the 
half year of 2016/17, reflecting strong 
sales and shipments in the last month 
of the year. 
Advanced payments were £28.5m, down 
from £45.5m, due to the mix of contracts 
in the order book.
Trade creditors were £46.5m up from

valuation of the UK defined benefit 
pension scheme (the Scheme) was 
finalised in June 2016. The Group 
agreed a revised funding plan with the 
trustees to eliminate the deficit over a 
period of 12 years from 31 March 2016. 
The plan will see the existing funding 
payment schedule extended from 2022 
to 2028. In addition, we have created 
a joint working group with the pension 
trustees to proactively manage our 
pension obligations.
The Group will continue to pay annual 
fees of £1.6m for managing the Scheme 
in addition to the cash contributions. 
In the year ended 25 March 2017, the 
Group made funding payments and 
management fees totalling £14.6m. 
The next triennial funding valuation 
is due in April 2018.
The valuation of the Scheme under 
IAS 19 indicates a post‑ tax deficit at 
25 March 2017 of £196.7m (26 March 
2016: £178.4m). On a pre‑ tax basis 
the net pension deficit was £237.0m 
(26 March 2016: £217.6m). The increase 
results from higher liabilities due to the 
impact of a lower discount rate used 
to value the Scheme liabilities (2.75% 
in 2016/17 compared with 3.50% 
in 2015/16) due to significant falls in 
corporate bond yields in addition to 
an increase in the expectation for the 
longer term inflation rate. The increase 
in liabilities has been partially offset 
by an increase in assets which have 
performed strongly in the year.

40  De La Rue  Annual Report 2017 In common with other final salary 
schemes, the Scheme valuation is 
very sensitive to any movement in the 
discount rate, with a 0.25% increase 
in discount rate resulting in a £55m 
decrease in liabilities or vice versa and 
hence the deficit would reduce should 
interest and discount rates increase in 
the future. 
The charge to operating profit in respect 
of the Scheme in 2016/17 was £1.5m 
(2015/16: £1.2m). In addition, under IAS 
19 there was a finance charge of £7.4m 
arising from the difference between 
the interest cost on liabilities and the 
interest income on scheme assets 
(2015/16: £7.1m). 
Capital structure
At 25 March 2017 the Group had 
net liabilities of £146.6m (26 March 
2016: £145.6m) mainly due to the 
recognition of the long term retirement 
benefit obligations of £239.4 (26 March 
2016: £219.9m) in accordance with IAS 
19 (total pension liabilities of £239.4m 
also include non UK defined benefit 
pension schemes).
The Company had shareholders’ funds 
of £230.5m (26 March 2016: £174.4m) 
and had 101.8m fully paid ordinary 
shares in issue (26 March 2017: 101.4m) 
at the year end.

De La Rue in the global context
Sustainability impacts every aspect of our business.  
We help governments protect their revenue, citizens  
to participate securely in the global economy and brands  
to safeguard their intellectual property. Our commitment  
to sustainability is expressed through our support for the  
UN Global Compact (UNGC).
Why we have joined the 
UN Global Compact
In April 2017, we were proud to become 
signatories to the UNGC in recognition 
of the key role that the UNGC plays 
in promoting the highest ethical 
standards. Joining the UNGC is a clear 
demonstration of the progress we are 
making in our five year transformation 
programme, which addresses a number 
of initiatives, including sustainability.
The UNGC is a voluntary initiative 
whereby companies align strategies 
and operations with universal principles 
on human rights, environment and 
anti-corruption, and take actions that 
advance societal goals. It is based 
on commitments of chief executives 
to implement universal sustainability 
principles and to take steps to support 
UN Sustainability Development Goals 
(SDGs). These goals aim to encourage 
individuals, organisations, governments 
and the international community to 
communicate and collaborate more 
effectively and to ensure that everyone 
has the right to prosper in the future.
We recognise the role that businesses 
can play in the achievement of the SDGs. 
As our Chief Executive Officer Martin 
Sutherland commented at the time of 
the signing, “Our business fights against 
counterfeiting every day and we aim to 
enable legal identity and social inclusion 
for our customers across the world. 
As a result, many of the SDGs are at the 
heart of what we do. We are proud to 
demonstrate that we are a responsible 
business – in the services we provide, 
the way we work and the contributions 
we make to the communities in which 
we operate.”
Joining the UN Global Compact demonstrates our 
commitment to being a responsible business. We are aware 
of the impact that our activities have on the world around  
us and the responsibilities of being a corporate citizen. 
In fact, many of our products and services are closely 
aligned to the UNGC’s broader sustainability objectives, 
including social inclusion, economic growth, transparency, 
health and safety, and security. 
The UNGC business principles
The UNGC requires that De La Rue acts in accordance with its ten principles 
covering human rights, labour, environment and anti-corruption. The section 
below shows how we comply with these principles.
Human rights Labour rights
1. Businesses should support and 
respect the protection of internationally 
proclaimed human rights; and
2. Make sure that they are not complicit 
in human rights abuses.
3. Businesses should uphold the 
freedom of association and the 
effective recognition of the right 
to collective bargaining;
4. The elimination of all forms of forced 
and compulsory labour;
5. The effective abolition of child 
labour; and
6. The elimination of discrimination 
in respect of employment 
and occupation.
Environment Anti-corruption
7 . Businesses should support 
a precautionary approach to 
environmental challenges;
8. Undertake initiatives to promote greater 
environmental responsibility; and
9. Encourage the development 
and diffusion of environmentally 
friendly technologies.
10.  Businesses should work against 
corruption in all its forms, including 
extortion and bribery.
42  De La Rue  Annual Report 2017  UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) 
As well as the ten UN principles 
which guide how we do business, 
the UNGC also requires that we 
support the UN SDGs (also known 
as the UN Global Goals).
We are committed to supporting the 
SDGs and ensuring that they are 
embedded into our daily operations. 
The Chief Executive Officer is the Board 
member with designated responsibility. 
He is supported by the Executive 
Leadership Team, the Risk Committee, 
and the Group Health, Safety and 
Environment Committee.
Our team carried out an internal audit 
which identified our alignment to the 
SDGs, and then grouped the SDGs 
according to the level of impact of our 
operations in those particular areas. 
This is helping us identify where we are 
best able to make a difference.
This is the first year that we are reporting 
within the UNGC Communications 
Framework, and this will be the baseline 
for future reporting.
The Board is responsible for assessing how corporate 
responsibility issues could affect the Group and for setting 
appropriate policies.

We provide governments and 
commercial organisations with products 
and services that underpin the integrity 
of trade, personal identity and the 
movement of people and goods. We help 
them shape their future by:
• Supporting governments in two-thirds 
of the world’s countries to tackle 
counterfeit cash, identities and goods
• Recognising the importance of 
improving business practices in the 
banknote industry, as a founding 
member of the Banknote Ethics

We help customers communicate currency 
changes to their own people and beyond. 
Our currency awareness and education 
campaigns protect users from counterfeiting 
by delivering clear, simple messages.
During the year, we assisted a total of 14 issuing 
authorities with their campaigns. For example, 
we helped the Central Bank of the Seychelles 
communicate the details of its new banknotes 
to the public.

Educating and training  
our people
Since April 2015, we have 
delivered training programmes 
to help our leaders and 
managers execute our 
strategy and help us innovate 
and grow as a business.
From April 2015 to 2017 , we 
held 213 courses covering 
23 subjects, attended 
by over 300 managers. 
Subjects covered range from 
understanding leadership 
impact and strategic choices 
to using storytelling as a key 
skill to engage employees. 
For 2017/18, our focus is 
on deepening understanding 
and skills.

SDGs
Focus and 
Improve
SDGs where we have the opportunity 
to improve and achieve great impact.
During 2016, we conducted an 
employee survey to gather views 
on the benefits offered by De La Rue. 
Following feedback, we have made 
a number of improvements:
• Launched a cycle-to-work scheme 
in the UK, for which we received 
a 5% uptake
• Extended our annual leave flexibility 
scheme (whereby employees can gain 
or forego leave), to a larger population 
within the UK
• Improved our maternity and paternity 
leave policies
In addition, we developed a global 
wellbeing strategy which will be launched 
in the new financial year. Our initial focus 
is on the areas of ‘mental wellbeing’ and 
‘keeping active’.
The wellbeing strategy will complement 
the existing occupational health and 
employee assistance programmes.
SDG 3 
Health and wellbeing
Gender equality is a key element of 
our inclusion strategy. The gender 
and inclusivity strategy is currently 
being rolled out, with support from 
the Executive Leadership Team. 
We will be sharing our mission, aims and 
our interventions with our employees. 
We plan to report our UK gender pay gap 
data and narrative externally, in line with 
the pending regulations. An important 
aim is that by 2020, 25% of senior and 
executive management roles should 
be filled by women.

Maintain 
Momentum
SDGs where we must maintain 
our strategies in order to ensure 
we continue to make an impact. 
Making progress
We have set demanding environmental 
targets and continue to work hard to 
improve our performance. While we are 
yet to meet our objectives, during the 
year we achieved around a 1% reduction 
in our GHG emissions and around a 5% 
reduction in solid waste sent to landfill, 
per metric tonne produced. 
Our emissions intensity was 224 net 
tCO
2e per £m turnover (2015/16: 206 
net tCO 2e), an increase of 9% which 
was largely driven by the 5% decrease 
in revenue. In real energy terms, natural 
gas consumption emissions were 
up 0.8%, while electricity emissions 
increased by 0.7%, primarily due to 
increased production.
SDG 6 
Clean water and sanitation
SDG 7 
Affordable and clean energy
Managing water usage
During the year, Overton mill was issued 
with a new Environmental Permit, which 
tightens many of the parameters to 
comply with the Industrial Emissions 
Directive for the pulp and paper industry. 
In response, we have established seven 
work packages to achieve Environment 
Agency compliance.
Across the company, water usage 
remained at the same level. At Overton 
mill, the intensity of water used per tonne 
of banknote paper produced reduced 
by 7%. The mill depends on abstracted 
groundwater, which is cleaned 
and discharged into the River Test. 
The river is classified as a Site of Special 
Scientific Interest and protected by UK 
conservation regulations. We continue 
to optimise water quality and quantity 
in line with ecological best practice.
How we gather and report data
We have again reviewed our data 
collection and reporting processes 
in line with best practice, with support 
from independent specialist consultant 
Carbon Clear.
Using an operational control approach, 
we collected activity data and reported 
on all material GHG emissions including 
Scopes 1 and 2 and a wider range 
of Scope 3. Data was checked both 
internally and by Carbon Clear, with the 
internally assured data being used to 
calculate GHG emissions. Our external 
auditor, KPMG, reviewed the process

46  De La Rue  Annual Report 2017 Human rights
We fully support the principles set 
out in the UN Declaration of Human 
Rights, in particular with regard 
to equal opportunity and freedom 
from discrimination.
Our Code of Business Principles 
covers human rights issues including 
employment principles, health and 
safety, anti-bribery and corruption and 
the protection of personal information. 
The Code also embraces whistleblowing 
– we seek to provide an environment 
where employees can raise concerns 
via a variety of mechanisms, including 
a CodeLine which is managed by an 
external third party.
We have launched an inclusion strategy 
to support our policy of treating 
all employees fairly and equally in 
recruitment, training, development, 
promotion and in their terms and 
conditions of employment, irrespective 
of their gender, transgender status, 
sexual orientation, religion or belief, 
marital status, civil partnership status, 
age, colour, nationality, national origin, 
disability or trade union affiliation.
Labour rights
We carry out internal and external audits 
to assure the Executive Leadership Team 
and the Board that all sites comply with 
our health, safety and environmental 
policies and any applicable legislation. 
We identify and use any necessary 
corrective actions, together with 
employee suggestions, to develop 
effective continuous improvement 
programmes. Our health, safety and 
environment standards and audit 
protocols are reviewed annually and 
updated where required in order to drive 
good practice and ensure alignment with 
the Operational Excellence programme.
During the year, De La Rue had no 
prosecution for infringing health and 
safety laws or regulations. All our main 
manufacturing sites have maintained 
OHSAS18001 certification for their 
health and safety management 
systems, following external audits 
by accredited providers. 
In order to further improve health and 
safety, we have launched a ‘Making 
Good Safety Decisions’ modular training 
programme for all employees. We are 
also increasing the number of NEBOSH 
certified managers across the business.

in the UK has achieved 
the Programme for the 
Endorsement of Forest

of Custody Accreditation, an 
international benchmark of 
forest product sustainability. 
This certification assures our 
customers that Bathford mill 
uses raw materials suppliers 
that operate sustainable and 
responsibly managed forests. 
In addition to a commitment 
to environmental protection, 
Chain of Custody holders must 
also demonstrate that workers’ 
rights and welfare are protected 
and indigenous peoples’ 
human and land tenure 
rights are respected.

We continued to focus on machinery safety 
during the year, with all new machinery 
checked by an independent consultancy 
to verify compliance with the latest UK/EU 
machinery safety requirements. As part of 
our manufacturing review project, we are 
relocating several large machines. All of 
these will be given full safety reviews prior 
to being refurbished and shipped to their 
new locations. We also continue to invest in 
and improve our fire risk management with 
several sites upgrading their on-machinery 
fire suppression systems.
We recognise that our responsibilities 
extend beyond our own organisation, 
and work with main suppliers and 
contractors to ensure that their health 
and safety processes are robust. 
In addition, we undertake commercial 
and operational due diligence when 
approving new suppliers, and also 
carry out regular audits and reviews 
of existing suppliers. We risk assess 
our supplier base by identifying 
suppliers which, either as a result of 
geographical location, industry sector 
or nature of commercial transaction, 
are considered to be at medium to 
high risk from a slavery and human 
trafficking perspective.
We are pleased to report that we 
achieved all of our health and safety 
objectives for 2016/17. We reduced our 
overall number of reportable accidents 
and lost time days due to accidental 
injuries. In a climate of continuing 
organisational changes, we have 
successfully maintained our positive 
safety culture and excellent internal 
reporting processes and continue 
to engage employees in our safety 
training programmes, delivering over 
2,000 man-days of health, safety and 
environment related training this year. 
We will continue to set robust health 
and safety objectives and targets and 
verify our compliance/good practice 
programmes through the internal 
audit programme.

Implementing the Modern Slavery Act 2015
Our Anti-Slavery & Human Trafficking Policy sets out our zero 
tolerance approach to modern slavery. It provides guidance 
to employees on implementing and enforcing effective systems 
and controls to ensure that modern slavery is not taking place 
either in our own business or our supply chain. 
We have identified that the key area of risk in our supply 
chain lies with raw materials suppliers of products such as 
cotton comber used in the manufacture of secure paper. 
Suppliers which are now identified as being medium or high 
risk are required to complete corporate social responsibility 
questionnaires which focus on identifying slavery or human 
trafficking issues within their organisation and their supply chain. 
We analyse these questionnaires, assess the associated risks 
and conduct supplier audits as appropriate.

Statistics (CRVS) services as well as 
identity management solutions to ensure 
that governments can plan for the needs 
of their population.
We recognise that it is vital that 
employees are happy and valued at their 
workplace. We are proud of the fact that 
our latest employee survey showed that 
70% of all participants would recommend 
De La Rue as a great place to work.
Many of our sites across the world 
engage with local communities by 
supporting charitable organisations, 
often focusing on smaller, locally 
based charities where our employees’ 
efforts can have the greatest impact. 
The highlights of the year included 
De La Rue for Good events at our 
head office which raised over £10,000 
for a local charity. The group-wide 
Three Peaks Challenge continues to 
remain popular, and raised more than 
£22,000 to benefit a number of charities. 
In addition, the De La Rue Charitable 
Trust – which offers match-funding to 
UK employees undertaking their own 
fundraising activities – donated over 
£14,000 to charities.

Strategic report Corporate governance Accounts
 Annual Report 2017  De La Rue  49 Dear Shareholder
This corporate governance statement 
describes how the Group is governed 
and managed, and how De La Rue plc 
applied the Principles of the UK Corporate 
Governance Code (the Code) throughout 
the year. The Board continues to ensure 
it upholds the highest governance 
standards. We recognise the need 
to lead on values and conduct in order 
to encourage the right behaviours 
throughout the Group. We believe that 
our culture and the quality of our people 
are critical to the success of the Group. 
You can read more about how we 
have developed our culture in the Chief 
Executive Officer’s review on page 24.
Board changes
Victoria Jarman stepped down as a 
Non-executive Director at the conclusion 
of last year’s AGM after serving six years. 
We were pleased to welcome Nick Bray 
to the Board as a Non-executive Director 
on 21 July 2016. Nick Bray is Chairman 
of the Audit Committee. Rupert Middleton 
has informed the Board of his decision 
to step down after the AGM in July 2017. 
Rupert’s replacement will report to the 
Chief Executive Officer and will not be a 
Board position. The Board composition, 
biographies and skills and experience are 
contained on pages 52, 53 and page 55.
Non-executive Director 
engagement
An important part of my role is to 
ensure that our Non-executive Directors 
offer both support to and challenge 
of the executive management team. 
The Non-executive Directors meet with 
the wider executive management team 
and regularly visit different sites.
Succession planning
Succession planning is an important 
element of good governance, ensuring 
that we are fully prepared for planned 
or sudden departures from key positions 
throughout the year. The Nomination 
Committee has reviewed the succession 
plans for the Board, the Executive 
Leadership Team and other key roles 
within the organisation. This review also 
provided visibility of the Group’s talent 
pipeline and the leadership development 
programme in place to ensure we are 
maximising the potential of our people.
Board effectiveness
We conducted our annual externally 
facilitated Board evaluation during the 
year, the outcome of which was very 
positive and confirmed that the Board 
and its Committees operate to a high 
standard. The Board discussed the 
findings in detail at one of its meetings. 
See page 61 for further details of 
this process.
As part of our performance evaluation 
process, I met with each of the Directors 
individually in respect of their own 
performance and to obtain their views 
on what was working well and what 
could be improved. 
The smooth operation of the Board 
and effective relationships between the 
Non-executive Directors and Executive 
Directors is critical and firmly in place 
at De La Rue. Frequent and open 
conversations with the Chief Executive 
Officer enable me and the Board to 
understand and debate both what 
is going on in the business and the 
challenges that lie ahead.
The Board agenda will continue to 
balance the need to improve oversight 
and governance of all aspects of the 
business with the ability to debate 
and examine forward-looking strategy, 
including changes to the business 
environment and markets in which 
we operate and compete.
Remuneration policy
The Remuneration Committee 
conducted a full review of our 
remuneration policy during the period. 
You can read more about this in the 
directors’ remuneration report on page 
75. The directors’ remuneration policy 
will be put to shareholders for approval 
at the forthcoming AGM.
Disclosure Committee
During 2016, the new EU Market Abuse 
Regulation (MAR) was implemented to 
ensure the smooth functioning of the 
market for financial securities by curbing 
behaviours that distort the price of 
securities and harm investor confidence. 
We have formalised the way in which 
we meet our obligations under MAR 
and established a Disclosure Committee, 
comprising three or more Directors, one 
of whom must be the Chairman, or in 
his absence, a Non-executive Director, 
to oversee the implementation of the 
governance and procedures associated 
with the assessment, control and disclosure 
of inside information. The Committee 
will meet as necessary or appropriate.
Board Committees
The Board delegates certain of its 
responsibilities to the Board Committees 
to enable it to carry out its functions 
effectively. The membership of the Board 
and Board Committees as at 23 May 2017 
can be found on page 59.
Audit tender
During the year, the Audit Committee 
led a tender process for external audit 
services, following which the Audit 
Committee agreed to recommend that 
the Board propose to shareholders at 
the forthcoming AGM the appointment 
of Ernst and Young LLP as auditor 
of the Company for the 2017/18 audit. 
Further information on the tender 
process is contained in the Audit 
Committee report on page 67.
Structure of the corporate 
governance statement
The corporate governance statement that 
follows is intended to give shareholders 
an understanding of the Company’s 
corporate governance arrangements 
and how they operated during the period. 
The corporate governance statement 
provides details of our governance policies 
and practices and includes reports from 
each of the Committee Chairs to provide 
details on key matters addressed by the 
Committees during the period. A diagram 
of the Board governance structure is set 
out on page 58.
Compliance with the UK Corporate 
Governance Code (the Code)
The Board considers that it and the 
Company has, throughout the period to 
25 March 2017, complied in all respects 
with the provisions of the Code issued 
in September 2014 which is the version 
of the Code which applies to the financial 
period. The Code is issued by the

Corporate governance
Chairman’s introduction
Philip Rogerson
Chairman
50  De La Rue  Annual Report 2017 The Board encourages a culture of strong governance 
across the business, and continues to adopt the principles 
of good governance and adhere to requirements of the 
UK Corporate Governance Code. 
The Board is collectively responsible to the Company’s shareholders for creating and preserving the long term success 
and performance of the business. The key Principles of the Code are outlined below:
Effectiveness
The Board sets the strategic objectives and approves and 
monitors performance against budgets and forecasts. 
An evaluation process is regularly undertaken to ensure 
Board members have the necessary skills in place.
Relations with shareholders
Maintaining strong relationships with both private and 
institutional shareholders is crucial in helping us achieve 
our aims. We hold events throughout the year to maintain 
an open and transparent dialogue with them.
Remuneration
The role of the Remuneration Committee is to determine 
and maintain a fair reward structure that attracts the 
right talent and incentivises Executive Directors to deliver 
strategic objectives and maintain stability of management.
Leadership
The Board provides leadership either directly or through 
the operation of its Committees. The Chairman is ultimately 
responsible for the make-up and composition of the Board 
to best deliver the business strategy.
Accountability 
The Board is responsible for establishing and maintaining 
the risk management and internal controls and has 
delegated responsibility to ensure compliance with the 
Code to the Ethics Committee, Audit Committee and 
Risk Committee.

Governance principle
The Board is collectively accountable to the Company’s shareholders for good 
corporate governance and all Directors are responsible for complying with their legal 
and fiduciary obligations. The Board is committed to ensuring the highest standard 
of corporate governance which is critical to creating value. The diverse range of 
experience offered by the Chairman and the Non-executive Directors means that they 
are well qualified to scrutinise performance, assess the Group’s risk management 
and control processes, provide constructive challenge and to support the 
Executive Directors.
Board composition 
and independence
The Board composition is set out on 
pages 52 to 53. The Directors have 
a range of experience and can bring 
independent judgement to bear on 
issues of strategy, performance, 
resources and standards of conduct. 
Details of each Director’s skills and 
experience are set out on page 55. 
This experience and judgement is 
considered vital to our success. 
It is the balance of skills, experience, 
independence and knowledge which 
ensures the duties and responsibilities 
of the Board and its Committees are 
discharged effectively.
The Board conducts a review of the 
independence of the Non-executive  
Directors annually based on the 
criteria in the Code and following 
consideration by the Nomination 
Committee. The Board concluded that 
all Non-executive Directors remained 
independent in character and judgement. 
Philip Rogerson was considered 
independent at the date of his appointment. 
His external appointments are set out 
on page 52. 
There is a clear division between the 
management of the Board and the 
Executive Directors’ responsibility 
for managing the Group’s business. 
However, no individual or small group 
can dominate decision-making.
Diversity
The Board has due regard for the 
benefits of diversity in its membership 
and strives to maintain the right 
diversity balance, while maintaining the 
over-arching aim of recruiting the best 
candidate based on merit. The Chairman 
seeks to ensure that the composition 
of the Board includes individuals with 
deep knowledge and experience, 
bringing a wide range of perspectives 
to the business.
Following the departure of Victoria 
Jarman, and as at 25 March 2017, the 
percentage of women on the Board has 
fallen to 12.5%. 
The Group’s inclusion strategy is 
discussed further on pages 45 and 47.

Key aspects of the Board’s role include: 
• Determining the responsibilities 
of Directors, in particular 
those of the Chairman and the 
Chief Executive Officer
• Reviewing the effectiveness of internal 
control processes
• Setting authority levels
• Approving the terms of reference and 
membership of Board Committees
Matters reserved to the Board 
and delegated authorities
In order to retain control of key decisions 
and ensure there is a clear division 
of responsibilities at the head of the 
Company between the running of the 
Board and the running of the Company’s 
business, the Board has identified 
certain ‘reserved matters’ that only it can 
approve. Other matters, responsibilities 
and authorities have been delegated to 
its Committees. The matters reserved 
to the Board and the terms of reference 
for each of its Committees, which are 
reviewed on an annual basis, can be 
found on the Company website at 
www.delarue.com. These were last 
reviewed on 30 March 2017. Any matter 
outside of these falls within the Chief 
Executive Officer’s responsibility and 
authority within specific delegated 
authorities. He reports on the activities 
through his (and the Chief Financial 
Officer’s) regular reports to the Board. 
The Board and each Committee receives 
sufficient, reliable and timely information 
in advance of meetings and are provided 
with access to all necessary resources 
and expertise to enable them to fulfil 
their responsibilities and undertake their 
duties in an effective manner. 
Board and Board Committee meetings
The Board and Board Committee attendance during the year is shown in the table below. In addition to the schedule of Board 
meetings, the Board meets for dinners that give the Directors additional time together to discuss issues more broadly. For further 
information regarding when the Board members joined or stepped down from Committees during the year, please refer to the 
relevant Board Committee report. If a Director is unable to attend a Board or Board Committee meeting, the absent Director 
is encouraged to communicate comments and opinions on the matters to be considered.

Corporate governance continued
Leadership
The Board’s area of focus
60  De La Rue  Annual Report 2017 Effectiveness
Conflicts of interests  
and independence
The Board has established a process 
to review at least annually and, if 
appropriate, authorise any conflict 
of interest and has carried out such 
a review during the year and authorised 
all Directors’ situational conflicts. 
Any transactional conflicts are reviewed 
as they arise. Directors are asked to 
review and confirm reported conflicts of 
interests as part of the year end process.
Culture and values
The Board considers leadership, culture 
and good governance as essential 
considerations in the Group’s ongoing 
transformation. As the business seeks 
to build a high performance culture 
across the Company to deliver on our 
strategy, the Board recognises the role 
it plays in providing leadership and tone 
from the top. The Board is developing 
a framework through the Executive 
Leadership Team for regular oversight 
of the culture within the Company. 
The intention is to ensure the De La Rue 
values are integral to the performance 
management of the senior leadership 
group and other employees and that the 
incentive structure in place supports and 
encourages behaviours consistent with 
those values. 
Board effectiveness
The Board and its Committees 
undertake an annual evaluation of their 
effectiveness. In 2016, the performance 
evaluation involved the use of an external 
independent facilitator, Lintstock Limited.
The review process involved completion 
of online questionnaires which focused 
on Board composition, expertise and 
dynamics, quality of decisions made, 
Board support and processes, structure, 
behaviours and other key issues such 
as strategy and succession. The review 
also addressed delivery of the Board’s 
objectives and any issues identified 
during the previous review or which 
became relevant during the year. A report 
on the performance of the Board and 
each of the principal Committees was 
compiled by Lintstock. The results of 
the questionnaire as they applied to the 
Board were discussed collectively and 
objectives for the coming year agreed. 
The Chairman and each Committee 
Chairman have discussions with each 
Director or Committee member based on 
the responses. The Senior Independent 
Director is responsible for appraising the 
Chairman’s performance in discussions 
with the Non-executive Directors and 
the Executive Directors in the absence 
of the Chairman. The Chairman holds 
one-to-one meetings with all Directors. 
The reviews undertaken in the year have 
concluded that the performance of the 
Board, its Committees and individual 
Directors was effective. A number of 
positive points were noted as well as 
areas of focus for the coming year, which 
will be monitored and progressed at the 
Board meetings scheduled for the year. 
Whistleblowing
A whistleblowing telephone hotline 
service allows De La Rue employees to 
raise concerns in relation to dishonesty 
or malpractice on an entirely confidential 
basis. The hotline is operated by a third 
party which is independent of De La Rue. 
Incoming reports are provided to 
the General Counsel and Company 
Secretary who ensures that the matters 
are appropriately investigated. The Ethics 
Committee and the Audit Committee 
receive regular reports on any matters 
raised through the hotline and monitor 
the use throughout De La Rue. 
Executive Leadership Team (ELT)
A clearly defined organisational structure 
exists within which individual responsibilities 
are identified. The management of the 
Group as a whole is delegated to the 
Chief Executive Officer and the ELT as 
discussed on page 59. The ELT is an 
executive-level forum of the Group’s 
most senior leaders, chaired by the Chief 
Executive Officer. It comes together to 
communicate, review and agree on issues 
and actions of Group-wide significance. 
It develops, implements and monitors 
strategic and operational plans, and 
considers the continuing applicability, 
appropriateness and impact of risk. 
It leads the Group’s culture and aids 
decision-making of the Chief Executive 
Officer in managing the business in 
the performance of his duties. The ELT 
members ensure that reports on their 
respective business areas are made to the 
Board through the Chief Executive Officer.
Induction and professional development
Newly-appointed Directors follow a tailored induction programme, 
facilitated by the Company Secretary, which includes dedicated time 
with Group executives and scheduled trips to a variety of business 
operations. All Directors are encouraged to undertake additional 
training and to visit the Group’s facilities.
Strategic report Corporate governance Accounts
 Annual Report 2017  De La Rue  61 Risk management 
and internal control
The Board retains overall responsibility 
for setting De La Rue’s risk appetite, 
and for risk management and internal 
control systems. The Board has 
carried out a robust assessment of 
the principal risks of the Company and 
how those risks affect the prospects 
of the Company. Further details on the 
ongoing risk management and internal 
control systems can be found in both 
the risk management section of this 
annual report and the Audit Committee 
report on pages 32 to 37 and pages 
65 to 68 respectively.
The Board confirms:
• There is an ongoing process for 
identifying, evaluating, and managing 
the principal risks faced by the Group
• The systems have been in place for 
the period under review and up to the 
date of approval of the annual report 
and accounts
• They are regularly reviewed by 
the Board
• The systems accord with the FRC 
guidance on risk management, 
internal control and related financial 
and business reporting
The Board is satisfied that the risk 
management and internal control 
systems in place remain effective.
This review does not extend to 
associated companies or joint ventures 
where the Group does not have 
management control. 
Assessment of the prospects 
of the Company and its 
viability statement
In accordance with provision C.2.2 of the 
Code, the Directors set out on page 37 
how they have assessed the prospects 
of the Company, over what period the 
prospects have been assessed, and the 
Company’s formal viability statement.

Other areas of focus included:
• Review of the composition of the 
Board and the range of skills and 
experience on the Board
• Recommended appointment of 
Nick Bray to the Board

• Review of senior leadership talent, 
succession and development
• Review of the composition 
of Board Committees
• Evaluation and effectiveness review 
• External commitments
Principal responsibilities
The key areas of responsibility

composition of the Board and 
its Committees, to ensure they 
remain appropriate, and to make 
recommendations to the Board
• To consider succession plans for 
Directors and senior executives
• To review the time commitment 
required of Non-executive Directors 
at least once a year
• To review the independence 
of the Non-executive Directors
The Chairman and the independent

Strategic report Corporate governance Accounts
 Annual Report 2017  De La Rue  63 Committee meetings
The Committee is required, in 
accordance with its terms of reference, 
to meet at least twice a year. During the 
year, the Committee met four times.
The Committee’s annual evaluation 
involved the use of an external 
independent facilitator, Lintstock Limited. 
It was concluded that the Committee 
continued to operate effectively.
Diversity
In considering appointments to the 
Board and to senior executive positions, 
it is the policy of the Committee to 
evaluate the skills, experience and 
knowledge required by a particular role 
with due regard for the benefit of diversity 
including gender diversity on the Board 
and at senior management level. The aim 
will continue to be the recruitment of 
the best candidate on merit regardless 
of gender.
As at 25 March 2017, the Company has 
one female Non-executive Director on 
the Board. The Board and the Committee 
have noted the recommendations of 
the Hampton-Alexander Review in 
November 2016 to increase female board 
representation to at least 33% by 2020 
and the recommendations of the Parker 
Review on board ethnic diversity.
The Company has established a formal 
process, led by a member of the 
Executive Leadership Team, to review 
and make recommendations on our 
inclusion strategy programme, including 
gender, representation of women within 
management and leadership roles. 
Our theme for International Women’s 
Day this year was ‘Be Bold for Change’ 
and we held a meeting for employees 
at our Viables site, where our female 
role models and leaders in the business 
shared their leadership journey and 
explored what inclusion intervention 
would look like and how to overcome 
challenges in a period of change. 
The Company’s policy on diversity 
applies across all levels of the Group, 
and further details on the approach 
to diversity are set out on pages 45 
and 48.
Succession planning and talent
The Committee has continued to work 
to put appropriate succession plans in 
place in order to ensure the right mix of 
skills and experience of Board members 
now and in the future. In addition, 
the Board recognises the focus on 
strengthening the pipeline of executive 
talent in the Company. An effective 
talent model supporting organisational 
development has been in operation 
for three years. Our high potential 
programme is designed to develop a 
pipeline of talent of future leaders and 
rising stars. A comprehensive talent 
review was presented to the Board, 
mapping successional candidates across 
all areas within the business. The skills 
and experience of those senior leaders 
were also reviewed to ensure there is 
the right mix in place to help deliver the 
strategic objectives of the Company and 
to build a high performance culture and 
pool for future growth. 
Our Leading Through Complexity 
programme is an essential part of 
De La Rue’s ambition to enhance 
leadership capability at both senior 
leadership group and managerial levels 
and drive culture change through 
the organisation. The programme is 
designed to encourage robust and 
honest debate to help lead more 
effectively in a matrix organisation leading 
to more dynamic, high performing teams. 
Ultimately, we want our leaders to be 
even more effective leaders – for their 
benefit, and for the benefit of their teams, 
our shareholders and our customers.
The Board has dinner with ELT members 
and other key managers at every 
opportunity to meet and exchange 
views and ideas.
Board changes
Victoria Jarman stepped down as 
a Non-executive Director of the 
Board at the conclusion of the 2016 
AGM. Nick Bray was appointed a 
Non-executive Director on 21 July 2016 
and he succeeded Victoria as Chairman 
of the Audit Committee. 
In its search for a replacement for Victoria 
Jarman, the Board retained The Zygos 
Partnership, an independent executive 
search firm which does not have any 
other connections with the Company. 
The Committee agreed the process, 
timetable and mandate for the Zygos 
Partnership. Nick Bray was identified 
by the Nomination Committee as part 
of the external search process and was 
subsequently recommended to the 
Board for appointment on the basis that 
he met the criteria required, including 
having sufficient time to discharge the 
requirements of the role.
Election and re-election
As in previous years, and in accordance 
with the UK Corporate Governance 
Code, all Directors will stand for election 
or re-election at the AGM. 
The Board, having carried out the 
effectiveness and evaluation process, 
considers the performance of each of 
the Directors standing for election and 
re-election at this year’s AGM to be 
fully satisfactory and is of the opinion 
that they have demonstrated ongoing 
effectiveness and continued commitment 
to the role. The Board strongly supports 
their election and re-election and 
recommends that shareholders vote 
in favour of the resolutions at the AGM.

Strategic report Corporate governance Accounts
 Annual Report 2017  De La Rue  65 Victoria Jarman stood down as Chair 
on her resignation from the Board 
at the AGM on 21 July 2016, and 
I chaired my first meeting in September 
2016. My thanks go to Victoria for 
her contribution to the work of the 
Committee over the years.
All members of the Committee are 
Independent Non-executive Directors. 
The Board is satisfied that the 
membership of the Audit Committee 
meets the requirement for relevant 
and recent financial experience. 
I have continued with the practice 
under Victoria Jarman of inviting the 
Chairman, Chief Executive Officer, 
Chief Financial Officer, Chief Operating 
Officer, General Counsel and Company 
Secretary, Director of Audit, Risk 
and Assurance and the external and 
internal auditors to join meetings of 
the Committee. The Director of Audit, 
Risk and Assurance, who is the chief 
internal auditor, and external auditors 
each meet the Committee without 
Executive Directors or other employees 
being present. 
Signiﬁcant accounting matters 
The Audit Committee is responsible for 
reviewing whether suitable accounting 
policies have been adopted and whether 
management has made appropriate 
estimates and judgements in the 
preparation of the financial statements. 
In respect of the financial statements 
for the period ended 25 March 2017, 
the significant issues reviewed and 
how these issues were addressed 
is summarised below:
Revenue recognition in 
the Currency division
The Committee considered the Group’s 
revenue recognition and contract 
accounting policies and procedures to 
ensure that they remained appropriate 
and that the Group’s internal controls 
were operating effectively in this area. 
Feedback was also sought from the 
external auditors over the application of 
the revenue recognition policy including 
a specific review of shipments pre and 
post year end. Following a review of the 
varied sources of information received, 
the Committee concluded that the 
accounting treatments were reasonable 
and appropriate.
Post-retirement beneﬁt obligations
The Committee received and considered 
reports from management and the 
external auditors in relation to the 
valuation of the defined benefit pension 
scheme and challenged the key actuarial 
assumptions used in calculating the 
scheme liabilities, especially in relation 
to discount rates, RPI inflation rates 
and mortality. 
The Committee discussed the reasons 
for the increase in the net pension 
deficit and was satisfied that the 
assumptions used were appropriate 
and were supported by independent 
actuarial specialists. Details of the key 
assumptions used are set out in note 23.
Valuation of inventory in Currency 
The Committee reviewed the Group’s 
policies and procedures over the 
valuation and recoverability of inventory 
in Currency (£53.2m). The Committee 
received confirmation that the valuation 
principles had been consistently applied 
and noted that the majority of inventory 
items were made to order rather than 
held for generic stock and hence the 
recoverability risk was low. Accordingly, 
the Committee concluded that the 
accounting treatments were reasonable 
and appropriate.
Estimation of warranty provisions
The Group holds a number of provisions 
relating to warranties including present 
obligations for defective products and 
known claims as well as anticipated 
claims that had not been reported at 
the balance sheet date. The Committee 
reviewed and discussed reports from 
management and the external auditors 
concerning the significant provisions held 
for such matters including any provisions 
with notable movements. The Committee 
considered the background to such 
provisions and challenged management 
over the judgements applied in 
determining the value of provisions 
required. The Committee enquired of 
management and the external auditors 
as to the existence of other matters 
potentially requiring a provision to be 
made. The Committee concluded that 
it was satisfied with the value of warranty 
provisions carried.
Classiﬁcation of exceptional items
As part of the Committee’s deliberations 
over whether the annual report and 
accounts, taken as a whole, is fair, 
balanced and understandable, the 
Committee also considered the 
amounts disclosed as exceptional 
items. The nature of the items classified 
as operating exceptional items during 
the period is described in note 2 
and 4. The Committee considered the 
accounting treatment and disclosure of 
these items in the financial statements 
including seeking the views of the 
external auditors. On the basis of this 
review, the Committee concluded 
that the accounting treatment and 
disclosures in relation to these items 
were appropriate.
Purchase accounting following the 
acquisition of DuPont Authentication
The Committee reviewed the purchase 
accounting following the acquisition of 
DuPont Authentication. The Committee 
reviewed the critical accounting 
estimates used in the purchase price 
allocation, specifically the valuation of 
acquired intangible assets and satisfied 
itself that the assets recognised on 
the Group balance sheet following 
the acquisition were reasonable.
Corporate governance continued
Accountability continued
66  De La Rue  Annual Report 2017 Independence and objectivity 
of external auditors
The Committee ensures that the external 
auditors (KPMG) remain independent 
of the Group. The Audit Committee has 
a detailed policy covering: 
• Choosing the statutory auditors and 
approving the audit fee
• Commissioning non-audit work
• Defining circumstances in which it 
is appropriate or inappropriate for 
incumbent auditors to be allowed to 
provide or be prohibited from providing 
non-audit work
• De La Rue’s procedures for procuring 
non-audit services from external 
sources, which specifically prohibits 
KPMG from undertaking certain types 
of service (including but not limited 
to services where it would audit its 
own work, where it would act in 
an advocacy role for the Group or 
where it would participate in activities 
normally undertaken by management) 
It may be cost-effective for KPMG to 
perform certain non-audit services, in 
particular where the skills and experience 
required make KPMG the most suitable 
supplier. Certain categories of non-audit 
services, including corporation tax 
compliance and due diligence services 
must be subject to competitive tender 
unless it is justifiable in the circumstances 
not to do so. Areas which would not 
normally be acceptable non-audit services 
but in exceptional circumstances may 
be considered appropriate, such as 
litigation and compliance services, require 
my prior approval. The selection criteria 
include detailed proposals, timescales, 
local resource, cost and the safeguards 
put in place by KPMG to avoid conflicts 
of interest or loss of independence. 
In addition, the Group’s policy is for any 
individual assignment to be undertaken 
by KPMG where the fee is likely to be in 
excess of £50,000 to be approved by 
me prior to commencement of work. 
During 2016/17 the amount of non-audit 
fees paid to KPMG was £0.2m.
The safeguards KPMG put in place 
avoid compromising their objectivity 
and independence. They provide a 
written report to the Audit Committee 
on how they comply with professional 
and regulatory requirements and 
best practice designed to ensure 
their independence. Key members of 
the KPMG audit team rotate and the 
firm ensures, where appropriate, that 
confidentiality is maintained between 
different parts of the firm providing 
services to De La Rue.
The Audit Committee places great 
emphasis on the objectivity of the 
Company’s auditors, KPMG, in reporting 
to shareholders.
The KPMG audit partner is present 
at Audit Committee meetings to ensure 
communication of matters relating 
to the audit. The Audit Committee 
has discussions with the auditors, 
without management being present, 
on the adequacy of controls and on 
judgemental areas and receives and 
reviews the auditors’ highlights reports 
and management letters which are 
one of the main outputs from the 
external audit.
The scope and key focus of 
the forthcoming year’s audit is 
discussed with, and approved by, 
the Audit Committee. 
Appointment of auditors
The Audit Committee assesses annually 
the qualification, expertise, resources 
and independence of the external auditors 
and the effectiveness of the audit process. 
The Audit Committee’s assessment 
is performed by an audit satisfaction 
questionnaire completed by the Chairman, 
relevant senior management and Audit 
Committee members. 
KPMG have been the Company’s 
auditors since 11 October 2006 following 
the last tender of the external audit.
In line with the Code, the external audit 
services for year ending March 2018 
were put up for tender in 2016.
The tender process involved members 
of the Audit Committee, Executive 
Directors, including the Chief Financial 
Officer, and the members of his team.
A request for proposal (RFP) was 
developed in consultation with the 
Chief Financial Officer and the Chairman 
of the Audit Committee.
Access was given to a data room where 
key documentation was provided.
The short-listed audit firms had various 
meetings with IT, Legal, Internal Audit, 
Tax Treasury, Group Accounting and 
Planning. A visit to the Overton paper 
mill was also arranged, in order to 
gain understanding and gather all the 
information needed to submit a proposal.
Following evaluation of the proposals, 
the audit firms were invited to present 
to the Chairman of the Audit Committee, 
Chairman of the Board, Chief Financial 
Officer and other senior members of the 
finance team.
The Audit Committee’s criteria for 
selection was published in the RFP 
and was based on audit quality and 
service, capability and competence of 
the firm, the team and the lead partner, 
behaviours, deliverables, relationships 
and organisational fit.
Strategic report Corporate governance Accounts
 Annual Report 2017  De La Rue  67 Following the conclusion of the tender 
process the Board confirmed its intention 
to propose to shareholders, for approval 
at the 2017 AGM, to appoint Ernst and 
Young LLP as the Group’s auditor.
De La Rue confirms its compliance with 
the Competition and Market Authority 
Order on mandatory tendering and audit 
committee responsibility.
Internal control and 
risk management 
As noted above, the Committee is 
responsible for reviewing, on behalf 
of the Board, the effectiveness of the 
Group’s internal financial controls and 
the assurance procedures relating to 
the Group’s risk management systems. 
These controls and procedures are 
designed to manage, but not eliminate, 
the risk of failure of the Group to meet 
its business objectives and, as such, 
provide reasonable but not absolute 
assurance against material misstatement 
or loss. The key elements of the Group’s 
risk management framework and 
procedures are set out on pages 32 to 
36. The Committee reviews these topics 
at each meeting and considers that none 
of the areas identified for enhancement 
during the year constituted a significant 
failing or weakness for the Group. 
Internal audit 
Assurance over the design and operation 
of internal controls across the Group 
is provided through a combination of 
techniques. The Board, through the Audit 
Committee, monitors the effectiveness 
of internal control systems through 
reports received from the internal audit 
function during the period. The internal 
audit function has been outsourced since 
2009. PwC LLP have performed this role 
since the start of 2013/14. 
Internal audit continued to ensure that 
their efforts were better aligned to 
the operational risks that the Group 
faces while maintaining an emphasis 
on reviewing the adequacy and 
effectiveness of general finance and IT 
controls across the Group on a cyclical 
basis. In addition to internal audit work, 
there is a system of self assessment 
internal control reviews by which 
management are required to detail and 
certify that controls are in operation 
to ensure the control environment in 
their business areas is appropriate. 
Actions agreed are followed up by senior 
management to ensure that satisfactory 
control is maintained. The internal audit 
plan is set and reviewed by the Audit 
Committee. Additionally, the Audit 
Committee reviews reports from the 
external auditors on internal control 
matters noted as part of their audit work.
The 2017/18 Internal Audit plan was 
approved by the Committee in April 
2017. The focus of the plan is to provide 
assurance over the migration to a new 
global finance platform.
Fair, balanced and 
understandable view
At its May 2017 meeting, the Committee 
reviewed the content of this annual 
report and accounts and advised the 
Board that, in its view, taken as a whole, 
it is fair, balanced and understandable 
and provides the information necessary 
for shareholders to assess the Group’s 
position and performance, business 
model and strategy.
In making its recommendation to 
the Board the Committee continued 
its robust existing governance 
arrangements by:
• Comprehensive Group and 
subsidiary accounts process, with 
written confirmations provided by 
business unit senior management 
teams on the health of the financial 
control environment
• Reviews of the annual report 
undertaken at different levels of the 
Group and by the senior management 
team that aim to ensure consistency 
and overall balance
• External audit review
• Clear guidance and instruction of the 
requirement provided to contributors
• Written confirmation that information 
provided by executive management 
has been done on a fair and 
balanced basis
• Additional reviews by the Audit 
Committee Chairman of the draft 
annual report in advance of the 
final sign-off in the context of the 
Code provision
Final sign-off is provided by the 
Board, on the recommendation 
of the Committee.

the Board evaluates the effectiveness 
of the risk management procedures 
conducted by senior management.

70  De La Rue  Annual Report 2017 De La Rue’s ethical framework
The Group delivers high profile security 
print products and services to customers 
across the world. It is essential that the 
Group maintains the trust and confidence 
of its customers, and everyone it deals 
with both inside and outside the Group, 
by demonstrating complete integrity 
in the way the Group and its business 
partners behave.
The Group has clear core values 
and principles which govern how all 
employees and business partners 
must behave. We believe that by 
committing to these values, supporting 
the business objectives and adhering 
to the expected behaviours, the culture 
of the business and the industry itself 
will be strengthened and the business 
will be well placed to deliver its 
strategic objectives.
The Group’s ethical framework is 
supported by the standards, policies, 
internal controls and communication 
as highlighted on page 72. We are a 
signatory to the UN Global Compact 
initiative which aligns company strategies 
and operations with universal principles 
on human rights, environment and 
anti-corruption. We also collaborate 
with the International Chamber of 
Commerce corporate responsibility 
and anti-corruption committee.
Our ethics and 
compliance programme
Code of Business Principles (CBP)
The CBP was reviewed and relaunched 
in 2016 and our nine core principles are 
regularly reviewed to ensure that they 
continue to underpin the way in which 
we conduct ourselves and work on 
a daily basis.
If an employee is found to have acted 
in breach of the CBP, the Group takes 
appropriate action to address that 
breach including disciplinary action and 
ultimately terminating employment in the 
most serious cases.
Gifts and hospitality
All employees are required to comply 
with the gifts and hospitality policy 
and the Committee receives a report 
on the gifts received or given by the 
Executive Directors. 
Banknote Ethics Initiative (BnEI)
De La Rue is one of the founding 
members of the Banknote Ethics 
Initiative (BnEI). BnEI sets out a rigorous 
framework for promoting high ethical 
standards in the industry and requires 
members to commit to the Code of 
Ethical Business Practice that was 
developed in partnership with the 
Institute of Business Ethics. The initiative 
was established to promote ethical 
business practice, with a focus on 
the prevention of corruption and on 
compliance with anti-trust law within the 
banknote industry. Compliance with the 
code is rigorously tested through an audit 
framework developed in conjunction with 
GoodCorporation, recognised worldwide 
as a leading company in the field of 
corporate responsibility assurance and 
business ethics. 
The audit focuses on anti-bribery and 
corruption and anti-trust processes, 
procedures and controls. The findings 
of the triennial BnEI audit confirm that 
De La Rue continues to perform strongly 
or above GoodCorporation benchmarks.
Third party partners (TPPs)
We recognise that it is not just our 
employees who could be exposed to 
ethics risks but also TPPs. Their conduct 
remains one of our most significant risks 
and there is a continuing requirement for 
TPPs to undergo our mandatory training 
programme and to conduct business in 
compliance with the standards set by 
the Company. We have controls in place 
in relation to remuneration of TPPs and 
we monitor all payments to ensure that 
the remuneration structure does not 
incentivise unethical behaviour.
Due diligence is undertaken on all our 
TPPs before they are engaged and this 
process is reviewed on a regular basis. 
TPPs are given regular training to ensure 
they remain alert to potential risks. 
Ethics Champions
The Group’s network of Ethics 
Champions ensures that each site has 
local support and representation for 
CBP matters and continues to play an 
integral part in ensuring that strong 
De La Rue values are embedded 
across the business. We held the Ethics 
Champions conference on 8 and 9 May 
2017 providing refresher training for our 
Ethics Champions.
Whistleblowing
The Audit Committee reviews our 
whistleblowing policy and procedures 
each year. Ethical questions or concerns 
raised by employees or third parties 
through the De La Rue CodeLine 
are investigated under the CBP and 
all findings and remedial actions are 
reported in detail in periodic reports 
prepared for and reviewed by the 
Ethics Committee. 
Result of all employee survey
We undertook an all employee survey 
during the year and the belief that we 
act honestly and ethically when doing 
business achieved the highest scoring.
Training
The Committee attaches significant 
importance to regular, relevant and 
focused training. Training during the 
period included:
• Relaunch of the anti-bribery and 
corruption (ABC) training which is 
compulsory for all customer and 
supplier-facing new starters to 
the Company
• Competition law training for all 
new starters
• Online training modules for TPPs and 
relevant employees 
• Security awareness training including 
guiding principles on ethical behaviour 
for employees travelling overseas

Dear Shareholder
As Chairman of the Remuneration 
Committee, I am pleased to present 
the report on the work of the Committee 
during the period to 25 March 2017. 
We believe our remuneration policy 
is critical to delivering both planned 
performance each year and the longer 
term transformation of De La Rue, 
according to the strategy published 
in 2015 for the five years to 2020. 
With a five year strategic plan to 
transform De La Rue from a banknote 
and passport manufacturer to a 
technology-led security product and 
service provider, our reward model 
supports the achievement of the specific 
short and long term objectives set out 
in that plan, and reinforces the desired 
behaviours and culture that will sustain 
the success of De La Rue.
We aim to ensure that executive 
remuneration is fair and competitive 
so that the Group can attract, motivate 
and retain the highly talented people 
required to deliver the operational and 
strategic transformation of the business 
that we have committed to. Above all, 
the Committee’s objective is to ensure 
that our directors’ remuneration policy 
incentivises and rewards delivery 
of sustainable shareholder value. 
Directors’ remuneration report
74  De La Rue  Annual Report 2017 Committee meetings
The Committee met five times during 
the period and details of attendance 
can be found on page 74. The Chief 
Executive Officer and the Group Director 
of Human Resources also attended 
meetings. The General Counsel and 
Company Secretary, who is also 
secretary to the Committee, advised 
on governance issues.
No Executive Director or employee 
is present or takes part in discussions 
in respect of matters relating directly 
to their own remuneration.
Structure of directors’ 
remuneration report
This report is presented in three main 
sections: an annual statement from 
the Chairman of the Committee; the 
directors’ remuneration policy to be 
approved by shareholders at the 
2017 AGM; and the annual report 
on remuneration for 2016/17.
In accordance with the regulations, we 
will be asking shareholders to vote on 
two separate remuneration resolutions 
as follows:
• The binding triennial vote on the 
proposed directors’ remuneration 
policy which will, subject to 
shareholder approval, become formally 
effective as at the date of the 2017 
AGM (and is set out on pages 76 to 83) 
• An advisory vote on the annual report 
on remuneration as set out on pages 
84 to 92 which provides details of the 
remuneration earned by Directors for 
performance in the period to 25 March 
2017 and how the current and existing 
policy will apply until the new policy 
is approved
2017 review of remuneration policy 
and shareholder consultation
This year the Committee, with support 
from our independent remuneration 
consultants, has undertaken a fundamental 
review of our remuneration policy. We have 
benchmarked our approach against the 
market, examined the latest guidance from 
government and the proxy institutions 
and consulted shareholders. Above all, 
we have tested our model against what 
we have committed to achieve both 
strategically and for shareholders. We have 
considered and debated a broad range 
of options for the redesign of the policy. 
Based on this comprehensive review, 
it is our conclusion and conviction that 
the basic structure of our existing policy 
on executive remuneration remains well- 
suited to this phase of our transformation 
and, accordingly, we are not proposing 
fundamental changes. But we have 
recognised how our approach to executive 
reward can be strengthened to give 
shareholders additional comfort about 
both the levels of reward as well as the 
commitment to long term creation of value. 
Accordingly, from this year we have 
greatly enhanced the level of disclosure 
associated with variable pay, proposed 
changes to holding arrangements 
for long term incentives and further 
developed the conditions for malus and 
clawback, which already conformed to 
best practice. We will continue to keep 
all aspects of our reward policy under 
review and be prepared to respond 
to changing circumstances.
Outcomes 2016/17
Annual Bonus Plan (ABP)
The maximum opportunity for Executive 
Directors under the ABP is 135% of 
salary for the Chief Executive Officer, 
115% for the Chief Financial Officer 
and 100% of salary for the Chief 
Operating Officer. For 2016/17, the bonus 
opportunity was based on an element 
of personal objectives and financial 
measures including:
• Group revenue 
• Group underlying operating profit
• Group cash conversion 
No payment is made on any element of 
bonus (including the personal element) 
if a minimum operating profit threshold is 
not achieved. Full details are on page 86.
In light of the above structure and ABP 
measures, I report that the ABP payout 
against the financial measures outlined 
above will be 21.5% of a maximum of 
80% of entitlement.
Detailed disclosure of the targets and 
performance against these measures 
are contained on page 86. 
Performance Share Plan (PSP)
Awards under the PSP in 2014/15 had 
three year performance criteria based 
on earnings per share (EPS) and return 
on capital employed (ROCE). Seventy five 
per cent of the award was based on 
EPS average compound growth above 
5%, and 25% on ROCE above 40%. 
Performance tests against both criteria 
were not achieved and therefore the 
award lapsed. Rupert Middleton, Chief 
Operating Officer was the only current 
Executive Director recipient of this 
award. The award was made to Rupert 
Middleton in June 2014 prior to his 
appointment as an Executive Director 
and prior to the recruitment of Martin 
Sutherland and Jitesh Sodha as Chief 
Executive Officer and Chief Financial 
Officer respectively.
ABP and PSP awards 2016
The Remuneration Committee made 
awards under the ABP and PSP in 2016 
and details of award levels and the 
performance conditions are on pages 
86 to 88. 
2017 salary review
The Committee has reviewed the salary 
levels of the Executive Directors and the 
Chairman’s fee. Details are provided on 
page 85. Increases are in line with those 
made to other employees. All salary 
increases are deferred until 1 July 2017.
I would like to thank shareholders 
who contributed to the Committee’s 
discussions during the year. 
I present our directors’ remuneration 
policy which will be subject to a binding 
vote at the 2017 AGM and the annual 
report on remuneration which is subject 
to an advisory vote. We recommend that 
all shareholders support the resolutions.

Strategic report Corporate governance Accounts
 Annual Report 2017  De La Rue  75 Introduction
This section of the report contains details of the Directors’ remuneration policy that will govern the Company’s future 
remuneration payments.
The Remuneration Committee has established the policy on the remuneration of the Executive Directors and the Chairman. 
The Board has established the policy on the remuneration of the other Non-executive Directors. Awards and benefits granted 
under the previous Directors’ remuneration policy will be honoured.
Proposed remuneration policy 
The Group’s remuneration policy aims to align the interests of the Executive Directors and other senior executives with those 
of shareholders.
The policy will take effect from 20 July 2017, subject to shareholder approval at the AGM. The remuneration policy is designed 
to ensure execution of the Group’s strategy and to align with the interests of shareholders. 
As indicated in the annual statement from the Chairman of the Remuneration Committee, we are not proposing fundamental 
changes to our existing remuneration policy. 
The table below summarises how the proposed policy compares with the current policy. The page reference for the full detail 
within the proposed policy is also provided.

Current wording Proposed wording
Share retention Executive Directors are encouraged to build up 
a shareholding over five years of one times salary.
Executive Directors are required to build up a shareholding equivalent to one 
times salary. It is intended that this is met by Executive Directors retaining 
100% of vested post-tax shares. See page 80.
Malus and  
clawback
ABP
The Remuneration Committee has the right to 
reduce any deferred bonus awards which have 
not yet vested to the extent that there has been 
a material misrepresentation in relation to the 
performance of the Group.
PSP
The Remuneration Committee has the right to 
claw back any PSP awards within three years 
of an award vesting to the extent that there has 
been misconduct, or a material misrepresentation 
in relation to the performance of the Company.
ABP and PSP awards are subject to malus and clawback provisions.
Clawback: provisions will apply for three years following payment of cash 
bonus (malus already applies to the deferred share element for a three year 
period). Awards may be clawed back in the following circumstances: material 
financial misstatement of results, gross misconduct or similar acts by the 
Executive Directors that could bring the business into disrepute and/or cause 
reputational damage.
Malus: provisions will apply to outstanding deferred share awards allowing 
the Committee to reduce the level of vesting in the event of: material financial 
misstatement of results, gross misconduct or similar acts by the Executive 
Directors that could bring the business into disrepute and/or cause reputational 
damage. See pages 78 to 79.
Remuneration 
Committee  
discretion
The Remuneration Committee maintains the 
ability to adjust or set different performance 
measures if events occur or circumstances arise 
which cause the Committee to determine that 
the performance conditions have ceased to be 
appropriate. If varied or replaced, the amended 
performance conditions must, in the opinion 
of the Committee, be fair, reasonable and 
materially no more or less difficult than the original 
conditions when set and these will be disclosed 
in the annual report on remuneration.
The Remuneration Committee reserves the right to adjust or set different 
performance measures for both short and long term plans if events occur 
or circumstances arise in which performance conditions have ceased to be 
appropriate. These events include substantial changes in business structure 
or strategy, acquisition or divestment. The Committee may also make 
discretionary adjustments, up and down, to the formulaic outcome of short 
and long term plans if there is misalignment with the Group’s strategic goals 
or shareholder interests. This discretion will be applied in exceptional cases 
only and disclosed. See page 80.
The overriding objective is to ensure that the executive remuneration policy encourages, reinforces and rewards the delivery 
of sustainable shareholder value. 
The Remuneration Committee believes that performance related pay and incentives should account for a significant proportion 
of the overall remuneration package of Executive Directors so that their reward is aligned with shareholder interests and the 
Group’s performance, without encouraging excessive risk-taking. Performance related elements of remuneration therefore form 
a significant proportion of the total remuneration packages. This is illustrated on page 83.
The Committee also has the discretion to take into account performance on environmental, social and governance matters.

Directors’ remuneration policy
76  De La Rue  Annual Report 2017 Policy table
The remuneration package for Executive Directors consists of fixed base salary, pension and other benefits and a significant 
proportion of variable pay including annual bonus and long term share based incentives. The following table summarises each 
element of the proposed remuneration policy for the Executive Directors and explains how each works and is linked to the 
corporate strategy. 
Base Salary
Purpose and link to strategy Operation Maximum potential opportunity Performance metrics
Fixed competitive remuneration 
set at levels to recruit and 
retain talent. Determination 
informed, but not led, by 
reference to the market place 
for companies of similar size 
and complexity.
Reflects individual skills, 
experience and responsibility 
necessary to deliver 
business strategy.
Rewards individual 
performance.
Reviewed annually and fixed 
for 12 months (but may be 
reviewed more frequently).
Influenced by:
• Role, experience, 
responsibilities 
and performance
• Change in broader 
workforce salary
• Group profitability and 
prevailing market conditions
• Salary levels across the 
Group generally
• Eliminating the gender 
pay gap.
Increases are not automatic.
To avoid creating expectations 
of Executive Directors and other 
employees, no maximum base 
salary has been set. Increases will 
not normally exceed the average of 
increases awarded within the rest 
of the Group in the UK.
Larger increases may be awarded 
in certain circumstances including, 
but not limited to:
• Increases in scope or responsibility
• Where market conditions indicate 
a lack of competitiveness and risk 
to attracting or retaining executives
Where the Remuneration Committee 
exercises its discretion to award 
increases above the average for other 
employees, a full explanation will be 
provided in the next annual report 
on remuneration.
Individual performance is the primary 
consideration in setting salary alongside 
overall Group performance, affordability 
and market competitiveness.
Benefits
Purpose and link to strategy Operation Maximum potential opportunity Performance metrics
Market competitive benefits 
sufficient to recruit and 
retain the talent necessary 
to develop and execute 
the business strategy.
Provision of car allowance, life 
assurance and private medical 
scheme. Executive Directors 
are also provided with 
permanent health insurance. 
Executive Directors can also 
participate in the annual leave 
flexibility scheme.
Other benefits may be 
provided on an individual basis 
such as, but not limited to, 
relocation allowances including 
transactional and legal costs, 
disturbance and travel and 
subsistence costs.
While the Remuneration Committee 
has not set an absolute maximum, 
benefits will be market competitive 
taking into account role and individual 
circumstances.
Not applicable.
Strategic report Corporate governance Accounts
 Annual Report 2017  De La Rue  77 Pension
Purpose and link to strategy Operation Maximum potential opportunity Performance metrics
To provide market 
competitive pensions 
sufficient to recruit and 
retain executives.
Executive Directors are offered 
membership of a defined 
contribution pension plan. 
The contribution rates offered are 
reflective of market practice and 
based on base salary only.
If contributions to the plan would 
cause an Executive Director 
to exceed the HM Revenue 
and Customs (HMRC) annual 
allowance or lifetime allowance 
limits, a cash allowance in lieu 
of pension contribution will 
be offered.
The contribution rates for 
the Executive Directors are 
30% of base salary for the 
Chief Executive Officer and 
20% of base salary for the 
Chief Financial Officer. 
The Executive Directors 
may choose to receive a 
cash allowance in lieu of 
contributions. The allowance 
is equal to the pension 
contribution that would 
otherwise have been paid 
less the Company’s national 
insurance contribution 
to ensure cost neutrality.
Not applicable.
Annual Bonus Plan (ABP)
Purpose and link to strategy Operation Maximum potential opportunity Performance metrics
To incentivise and reward 
delivery of financial and 
personal performance 
targets that address the 
distinct commercial and 
strategic needs of the 
business, and align with 
shareholder interests.
To ensure a consistent and 
stable reward structure 
throughout the management 
group that will remain fit 
for purpose. 
To support a pay for 
performance philosophy.
To help attract and retain top 
talent and be cost effective.
Executive Directors are 
required to hold a level 
of shareholding of 100% 
of salary as described 
on page 80.
Compulsory deferral of 
shares supports alignment 
with shareholder interests 
and also provides a 
retention element.
The Remuneration Committee 
sets Group financial targets and 
agrees personal objectives for 
each Executive Director at the start 
of each year. Reference is made 
to the prior year and to budgets 
and business plans while ensuring 
the levels set are appropriately 
challenging but do not encourage 
excessive risk-taking. 
Payments are determined by the 
Remuneration Committee after 
the year end. The bonus plan is 
non-contractual and may be offered 
on a year by year basis.
Sixty per cent of annual bonus is 
payable immediately in cash. Forty 
per cent of annual bonus is payable 
in deferred shares and released 
in tranches, subject to continued 
employment (with early release in 
certain circumstances). There are 
no further performance conditions.
Fifty per cent of deferred shares are 
released one year after cash payout 
and the remaining 50% two years 
after cash payout.
The Remuneration Committee 
may increase the number of shares 
subject to a deferred share award 
to reflect dividends that would have 
been paid over the deferral period 
on shares that vest.
The deferred share element will 
be disclosed in the annual report 
on remuneration.
The cash and deferred share 
element are subject to malus and 
clawback provisions to allow the 
Company to recoup three years 
from award in the event of material 
financial misstatement of results or 
gross misconduct and other acts 
or omissions that could bring the 
business into disrepute and or cause 
reputational damage.
The current annual maximum 
bonus opportunity of 135% of 
salary for the Chief Executive 
Officer and 115% of salary 
for the Chief Financial Officer 
linked to business performance 
will continue to apply.
The Remuneration Committee 
has the discretion to increase 
the overall maximum bonus 
level to 150% of salary, subject 
to this not being above the 
competitive market range.
The bonus payout level is determined by 
achievement of Group financial performance 
measures with an element based on 
personal objectives. The metrics, while 
stretching, do not encourage inappropriate 
risks to be taken.
The Remuneration Committee will maintain 
discretion to consider the financial underpin 
in respect of awards under the ABP. Financial 
targets and weightings will be disclosed 
in the annual report on remuneration.

Sixty per cent of the award vests 
after three years provided Group 
performance (two metrics) criteria 
are met and the balance will vest 
after a further one year subject to 
continued employment.
The Remuneration Committee 
may add dividend shares accrued 
only on vested shares during 
the performance and extended 
vesting period. 
Vesting of awards is subject to 
continued employment until the 
vesting date but, as described on 
page 81, PSP awards may also vest 
early in ‘good leaver’ circumstances. 
Awards under the PSP will vest early 
on a change of control (or other 
similar event) subject to satisfaction 
of the performance conditions and, 
unless the Remuneration Committee 
determines otherwise, pro-rating 
for time.
The Remuneration Committee 
has the right to clawback any PSP 
awards within three years of an 
award vesting to the extent there has 
been material financial misstatement 
of results, gross misconduct or any 
act or omission that could bring 
the business into disrepute and 
or cause reputational damage. 
Malus provision also applies.
The maximum number of 
shares which may be subject 
to an award granted to eligible 
employees in any financial 
year shall be an amount 
equal to such percentage, 
not exceeding 100% of salary 
as at the award date, as 
may be determined by the 
Remuneration Committee. 
The Committee retains 
discretion in exceptional 
circumstances to grant awards 
with a face value of up to 150% 
of salary.
Awards will vest subject to the achievement 
of Group performance over a period of 
three years against key metrics set by the 
Remuneration Committee which are aligned 
to commercial business needs and strategy. 
For proposed awards in 2017/18, the vesting 
of PSP awards will be subject to EPS 
and return on capital employed (ROCE) 
performance conditions.
The Remuneration Committee must be 
satisfied that vesting reflects the underlying 
performance of the Group and retains the 
flexibility to adjust the vesting amount to 
ensure it remains appropriate to the business 
performance achieved.
The Remuneration Committee regularly 
reviews the performance conditions and 
targets to ensure they continue to be aligned 
with the Group’s business objectives and 
strategy and retains the discretion to change 
the measures and their respective weightings 
to ensure continuing alignment with such 
objectives and strategy.
The Remuneration Committee maintains the 
ability to adjust or set different performance 
measures if events occur or circumstances 
arise which cause the Committee to 
determine that the performance conditions 
have ceased to be appropriate. If varied 
or replaced, the amended performance 
conditions must, in the opinion of the 
Committee, be fair, reasonable and 
materially no more or less difficult than 
the original condition when set and these 
will be disclosed in the annual report 
on remuneration.
All employee share plans
Purpose and link to strategy Operation Maximum potential opportunity Performance metrics
To encourage employees 
including the Executive 
Directors to build a 
shareholding through the 
operation of all employee 
share plans such as the 
HMRC approved De La Rue 
Sharesave scheme in the UK.
Executive Directors may participate 
in the Sharesave scheme on the 
same terms as other employees.
Under the UK Sharesave scheme, 
the option price may be discounted 
by up to 20%. Accumulated savings 
through payroll may be used to 
exercise an option to acquire shares.
Under the Employee Share Purchase 
Plan, employees in the US may be 
offered the opportunity to purchase 
the Company’s shares at a 15% 
discount to the market price. Any 
purchases are funded through 
accumulated payroll deductions.
Shareholders approved the Rules 
of Sharesave and the ESPP at the 
2012 AGM.
The maximum savings amount 
currently offered is £500 per 
month over a three or five year 
period under the Company’s 
Sharesave scheme. The rules 
of the scheme provide for 
savings up to the legislative 
limit of £500 per month.
No performance measures but employment 
conditions apply.
Strategic report Corporate governance Accounts
 Annual Report 2017  De La Rue  79 Shareholding requirement for Executive Directors
The Remuneration Committee believes that it is important that the interests of Executive Directors should be closely aligned 
with those of shareholders. The Committee has adopted a policy that Executive Directors are required to build up a shareholding 
equivalent to one times salary. It is intended that this is met by Executive Directors retaining 100% of vested post-tax deferred 
bonus shares, restricted shares and performance shares until the requirement is met in full. 
Pay policy for other employees
When determining the remuneration arrangements for Executive Directors, the Remuneration Committee takes into consideration 
the pay and conditions of employees throughout the Group. In particular, the Committee is kept informed of:
• Salary increases for the general employee population
• Overall spend on annual bonus
• Participation levels in the ABP
The remuneration policy applied to the Executive Leadership Team and the most senior executives in the Group is similar to the 
policy for the Executive Directors in that a significant element of remuneration is dependent on Group and individual performance. 
The key principles of the remuneration are applied consistently across the Group below this level, taking account of seniority and 
local market practice. The Group aims to offer competitive levels of remuneration, benefits and incentives to attract and retain 
employees. The Remuneration Committee consults with the Chief Executive Officer on the remuneration of executives directly 
reporting to him and other senior executives and seeks to ensure a consistent approach across the Group taking account 
of seniority and market practice and the key remuneration policies outlined above. On authority of the Committee, the Chief 
Executive Officer has discretion to make awards to a limited number of employees not being Executive Directors or Executive 
Leadership Team members.
All UK employees may join the Company’s HMRC approved Sharesave scheme. Options are granted over De La Rue plc shares, 
at an exercise price, at the discretion of the Remuneration Committee, of a maximum of 80% of the prevailing market share price 
at the time of grant. Eligible US employees may participate in the ESPP. The purchase price is 85% of the lower of the market 
value of a De La Rue plc share either at the beginning or end of the offering period. Offerings under the Sharesave and the ESPP 
are at the discretion of the Remuneration Committee.
The Remuneration Committee considered that it would be impractical to consult with employees when drawing up the 
remuneration policy.
Remuneration Committee discretion
The Remuneration Committee reserves the right to adjust or set different performance measures for both short and long term 
plans if events occur or circumstances arise in which performance conditions have ceased to be appropriate. These events 
include substantial changes in business structure or strategy, acquisition or divestment. The Committee may also make 
discretionary adjustments, up and down, to the formulaic outcome of short and long term plans if there is misalignment with 
the Group’s strategic goals or shareholder interests. This discretion will be applied in exceptional cases only and disclosed.
Shareholder views
The Remuneration Committee engages in regular dialogue with shareholders to discuss and take feedback on its remuneration 
policy and governance matters. During the last year the Committee has consulted with De La Rue’s largest UK shareholders and 
the main UK institutional investor bodies on the proposals for the new directors’ remuneration policy subject to a binding vote 
at the AGM on 20 July 2017. The Committee welcomes an open dialogue with shareholders and intends to continue to consult 
with major shareholders before implementing any significant change to the directors’ remuneration policy.
Service contracts
The Board’s policy for current and new Executive Directors is that service contracts are one year rolling contracts with 
a notice period that should not exceed one year. 
The Remuneration Committee recognises that in the case of appointments to the Board from outside the Group, it may 
be necessary to offer a longer initial notice period, which would subsequently reduce to 12 months after that initial period.
Non-executive Directors
Philip Rogerson, Chairman, was initially appointed as a Non-executive Director and Chairman designate on 1 March 2012. 
All Directors offer themselves for annual re-election at each AGM in accordance with the UK Corporate Governance Code. 
Service contracts for Executive Directors and letters of appointment for Non-executive Directors are available for inspection 
at the registered office address of the Company.

80  De La Rue  Annual Report 2017 Payment for loss of office 
In determining compensation for early termination of a service contract, the Remuneration Committee carefully considers the 
specific circumstances, the Company’s commitments under the individual’s contract and the individual’s obligation to mitigate 
loss. The table below outlines the framework for contracts for Executive Directors. Should additional compensation matters arise, 
such as a settlement or compromise agreement, the Remuneration Committee will exercise judgement and will take into account 
the specific commercial circumstances.
Policy
Notice period  
on termination  
by the Company
12 calendar months. The Remuneration Committee recognises that in the case of appointment to the 
Board from outside the Group, it may be necessary to offer a longer initial notice period, which would 
subsequently reduce to 12 months.
Termination payment  
at the Company’s 
sole discretion
On termination by either the Company or the relevant Executive Director, the Company retains the 
discretion to make a payment in lieu of notice not exceeding 12 months’ basic salary, excluding 
bonus but including benefits in kind (including company car or car allowance and private health 
insurance) and pension contributions (which may include salary supplement).
Benefits provided in connection with termination payments may also include, but are not limited to, 
outplacement and legal fees.
Change of control Under the ABP, share awards will vest in full on change of control. Awards under the PSP will vest 
early on a change of control (or other similar event) subject to satisfaction of the performance 
conditions and, unless the Remuneration Committee determines otherwise, pro-rating for time.
Vesting of incentives  
for leavers
The Remuneration Committee has the discretion to determine appropriate bonus amounts taking into 
consideration the circumstances in which an Executive Director leaves. Typically for ‘good leavers’, 
bonus amounts (as estimated by the Remuneration Committee) will be pro-rated for time in service 
to termination and will be subject to performance, paid at the usual time. 
The vesting of share awards is governed by the rules of the appropriate incentive plan approved 
by shareholders. Typically for ‘good leavers’:
• Under the ABP, the provisions allow awards to vest in full at the normal vesting date or earlier  
at the discretion of the Remuneration Committee
• Under the PSP, awards pro-rated (unless the Remuneration Committee determines otherwise) to 
the date of departure, will vest at the normal vesting date if the relevant performance targets have 
been met. The Remuneration Committee has the discretion to test the performance targets early 
and accelerate vesting
• Good leavers under the Sharesave scheme, which is HMRC approved, are entitled to exercise 
options, pro-rated to the savings made
• If awards are made on recruitment the treatment on leaving would be determined at the time 
at the Remuneration Committee’s discretion in accordance with the relevant plan rules
Pension benefits These will be paid in accordance with the rules of the pension scheme. Where an early retirement 
pension is paid from a legacy UK defined benefit arrangement, a reduction will be made to the 
pension to reflect early receipt using factors determined and set by the Trustees from time to time.
Strategic report Corporate governance Accounts
 Annual Report 2017  De La Rue  81 Remuneration policy for the Chairman and Non-executive Directors
Element Operation by the Company
Chairman fees The remuneration of the Chairman is set by the Remuneration Committee. Fees are set at a level 
which reflects the skills, knowledge and experience of the individual, while taking into account 
market data.
Non-executive  
Director fees
Non-executive Directors do not have service contracts but are appointed for fixed terms of three 
years renewable for a further three years. Terms beyond this period are considered on a case 
by case basis.
The Board (excluding Non-executive Directors) is responsible for setting Non-executive Directors’ 
fees. Fees are structured as a basic fee for Board and Committee membership. Committee Chairmen 
and the Senior Independent Director receive an additional fee. Reasonable expenses for attending 
Board meetings are reimbursed by the Company and the Group may pay any tax due on 
such benefits.
Total fees paid to Non-executive Directors will remain within the limit set out in the Company’s articles 
of association of £750,000 per annum.
Non-executive Directors are not eligible for pension scheme membership and do not participate 
in any of the Group’s annual incentive arrangements, or share option schemes. No compensation 
is payable to the Chairman or to any Non-executive Director if the appointment is terminated.
Remuneration policy for new appointments
When considering the appointment of Executive Directors, the Committee balances the need to attract candidates of sufficient 
calibre while remaining mindful of the need to pay no more than necessary. The Committee will typically align the remuneration 
package with the above remuneration policy. Base salary may be set at a higher or lower level than previous incumbents. 
Where possible, salary may be set at an initially lower level with the intention of increasing it over the following two years 
dependent on performance in the role and experience gained. In certain circumstances, to facilitate the recruitment of individuals 
of the required calibre, incentive arrangements and awards may also be higher. The Remuneration Committee retains the 
discretion to make payments or awards which are outside the policy to facilitate the recruitment of candidates of the appropriate 
calibre to implement the Group’s strategy. In addition, remuneration forfeited on resignation from a previous employer may be 
compensated. The form of this compensation would be considered on a case by case basis and may comprise either cash 
or shares. Generally (though not necessarily in all circumstances) the Committee will favour share awards with appropriately 
stretching performance targets attached and, at a minimum, expects that:
• If forfeited remuneration was in the form of shares, compensation will be in the form of shares 
• If forfeited remuneration was subject to achievement of performance conditions, compensation will be subject 
to no less challenging performance conditions 
• The timing of any compensation will, where practicable, match the vesting schedule of the remuneration forfeited
A newly-appointed Executive Director may be provided with reasonable relocation support.
Internal appointments will receive a remuneration package that is consistent with the remuneration policy. Legacy terms 
and conditions would be honoured, including pension entitlements and any outstanding incentive awards.
Subject to the limit on additional maximum variable remuneration set out below, incentive awards may be granted within the 
first 12 months of appointment above the maximum award opportunities set out in the policy table above. Excluding payments 
or awards to compensate for remuneration forfeited on resignation from a previous employer, the maximum level of variable 
remuneration which may be awarded to a new Executive Director, above the maximum levels set out in the policy table above, 
is one times base salary. 
The Remuneration Committee will ensure that variable remuneration is linked to the achievement of appropriate and 
challenging performance measures and will be forfeited if performance or continued employment conditions are not met.
Fees payable to a newly-appointed Chairman or Non-executive Director will be in line with the fee policy in place at the 
time of appointment.

Annual report on remuneration
84  De La Rue  Annual Report 2017 Individual elements of remuneration
Base salary and fees (audited)
Base salaries for Executive Directors are reviewed annually by the Remuneration Committee and are set with reference 
to individual performance, experience and responsibilities, Group performance, affordability and market competitiveness. 
An annual salary review was carried out by the Remuneration Committee on 27 April 2017. Following that review the Committee 
agreed an increase in salary for Martin Sutherland and Jitesh Sodha for 2017/18 payable from 1 July 2017 as follows:
Base salary

 Rupert Middleton will stand down from the Board at the conclusion of the AGM on 20 July 2017 and he will not receive a salary increase for 2017/18.
The current directors’ remuneration policy, approved by shareholders at the 2014 AGM, is that increases in salary for Executive 
Directors will not normally exceed the range of increases awarded to other employees in the Group except in the specific 
circumstances listed in the binding policy. This policy is maintained in the new directors’ remuneration policy being put to 
shareholders at this year’s AGM.
The remuneration policy for Non-executive Directors, other than the Chairman, is determined by the Board. Fees reflect the 
responsibilities and duties of Non-executive Directors while also having regard to the market place. The Non-executive Directors 
do not participate in any of the Group’s share incentive plans nor do they receive any benefits or pension contributions. 
The Chairmen of the Remuneration Committee and Audit Committee and the Senior Independent Director received a further fee 
of £8,000 to reflect their additional duties in 2016/17. Basic fees payable to Non-executive Directors were increased by 2% for 
2017/18 effective from 1 July 2017, with no change in the additional fee for chairing Board Committees. The fees are as follows:
Non-executive Director fees
2017 
£’000
2016

Basic fee 50 49
Additional fee for chairmanship of Audit and Remuneration Committees and Senior Independent Director 8 8
The Chairman will receive a fee of £194,000 with effect from 1 July 2017.
Strategic report Corporate governance Accounts
 Annual Report 2017  De La Rue  85 Performance against targets (audited)
Annual bonus
The annual bonus is delivered under the Annual Bonus Plan (ABP). 
ABP performance measures 2016/17
The ABP was operated on similar terms with respect to structure, financial measures and weightings as in 2015/16. The bonus 
opportunity was based on an element of personal objectives (20%) and a number of financial performance metrics apportioned 
as follows:
• Group revenue (20%)
• Group adjusted operating profit (40%)
• Group cash conversion (20%)
No payments will be made on any element of bonus (including the personal element) if a minimum operating profit threshold 
is not achieved. In addition, the Remuneration Committee has discretion to consider other factors, such as ethical behaviours, 
corporate responsibility, environment and health and safety matters as it sees fit when determining awards. 
Annual bonus payments to Executive Directors have the following restrictions: 60% of the bonus opportunity is payable in cash 
with the remaining 40% deferred in shares. Half of the deferred shares will vest one year after the cash payout and the remaining 
half of the deferred shares will vest two years after the cash payout. There was no change to the maximum bonus opportunities 
for Executive Directors as described in the directors’ remuneration policy table on page 78.
Disclosure of 2016/17 bonus targets 
The Remuneration Committee has agreed to adopt an approach of full retrospective disclosure of bonus targets in response 
to comments from investors during the policy review process. The following table provides detail on the bonus target measures.
Measure Threshold Target Max Actual
% of maximum 
achieved
Group revenue £480m £500m £520m £462m 0
Group adjusted operating profit £66.4m £70.4m £74.4m £70.7m 21.5
Group cash conversion 140% 150% 160% 114% 0
Twenty per cent of the Executive Directors’ bonus is based on achievement of personal objectives. 
Personal objectives are based on Group objectives comprising both tactical and transformational targets focused on the 
achievement of core strategic priorities and encompassing improved efficiency, strengthened financial performance, product 
innovation and culture change. In addition, each Executive Leadership Team member has personal objectives relating to their 
own area of functional responsibility.
Following a review of achievement against the personal objectives for the Executive Directors, the Remuneration Committee 
concluded that:
• Martin Sutherland should receive a payment of 18% of maximum opportunity 
• Jitesh Sodha should receive a payment of 19% of maximum opportunity
• Rupert Middleton will not be eligible for a payment for 2016/17
The 2016/17 cash bonus and deferred share element is detailed in the table below:

ABP 2017/18
The Remuneration Committee has determined that the bonus in respect of 2017/18 will be operated on similar terms of structure, 
financial measures (Group revenue, Group adjusted operating profit, Group cash conversion) and weightings as in 2016/17. 
The performance measures are appropriately weighted and incentivise the Executive Directors to achieve the desired outcomes 
without undue risk of focusing on any one financial measure. No payments will be made on any element of bonus (including 
the personal element) if a minimum operating profit threshold is not achieved. There will be no change to the maximum bonus 
opportunities for Executive Directors. The specific performance points are not disclosed while still commercially sensitive, 
but are disclosed the following year.
Directors’ remuneration report continued
Annual report on remuneration continued
86  De La Rue  Annual Report 2017 Long term incentive – Performance Share Plan (PSP) 
The PSP is a share based long term incentive aligned closely with business strategy and interests of shareholders through the 
performance measures chosen. The PSP is designed to provide Executive Directors and selected senior managers with a long 
term incentive that promotes annual and long term performance and reinforces alignment between participants and shareholders. 
Performance measures applying to PSP Awards 
The awards made under the PSP were subject to a combination of compound average growth in underlying basic EPS and 
average return on capital employed (ROCE). EPS growth ensures any payout is supported by sound profitability. ROCE supports 
the strategic focus on growth and margins ensuring cash is reinvested to generate the appropriate returns. 
All awards are made as performance shares based on a percentage of salary and the value is divided by the average share price 
over a period before the date of grant in accordance with the rules of the PSP. In addition, the Remuneration Committee must be 
satisfied that the vesting reflects the underlying performance of the Group and retains the flexibility to adjust the vesting amount 
to ensure it remains appropriate. Any adjustments will depend on the nature, timing and materiality of any contributory factors.
A summary of the performance measures, weighting and award vesting levels that apply to awards under the PSP is shown 
in the table below:

 The vesting levels under ROCE have been adjusted to take account of the impact of a discontinued operation held for sale as described in note 2 to the financial statements. 
The Remuneration Committee is satisfied that the performance measures which are appropriately weighted support the Group’s strategy and business objectives.
EPS and ROCE remain the most appropriate long term incentive measures and provide a strong line of sight between strategy, 
business performance and executive reward. The Remuneration Committee believes that the performance necessary to achieve 
awards is sufficiently stretching.
Strategic report Corporate governance Accounts
 Annual Report 2017  De La Rue  87 PSP award vesting in 2017
Rupert Middleton is the only current serving Executive Director who was in receipt of this award in June 2014 prior to his 
appointment as an Executive Director. Awards under the PSP had three year performance criteria based on earnings per 
share (EPS) and return on capital employed (ROCE). Seventy five per cent of the award was based on underlying EPS average 
compound growth above 5% and 25% was based on ROCE of over 40%. 
The performance period for the 2014 PSP awards ended on 25 March 2017. Over the period:
• The Group’s underlying EPS growth was -8% per annum over the three years from 2014. Since this was below the threshold 
growth of 5% per annum, shares will not vest under this performance measure 
• De La Rue’s average ROCE for the period was 39%. Since this was below the threshold of 40%, shares will not vest under 
this performance measure
Performance tests against both criteria were not achieved and therefore the award lapsed. 
PSP awards made in June 2016 (audited)
Executive Directors received PSP awards in line with the existing directors’ remuneration policy as follows:
Number of  
shares awarded Date of award % of salary
Face value  
£’000
Vesting at threshold  
(as a % of maximum)
Performance  
period end date
Martin Sutherland 90,813 27 June 2016 100 425 25 31 March 2019

Rupert Middleton 61,438 27 June 2016 100 288 25 31 March 2019
All awards are made as performance shares based on a percentage of salary and the value is divided by the average share price 
over a five day period prior to the date of award, being 520.85p for the award. Face value is the maximum number of shares that 
would vest multiplied by the share price (468.25p on 27 June 2016) at the date of grant. 
Performance measures applying to PSP awards to be made in 2017
The Remuneration Committee has given detailed consideration, following shareholder consultation during 2016, to the potential 
reintroduction of a relative TSR performance measure but concluded that the measures of EPS growth and ROCE are the most 
appropriate measures for De La Rue. Past experience has identified the difficulty in selecting a robust and relevant comparator 
group with simple reference to the broad FTSE 250 index not considered appropriate.
At least 5% per annum growth in EPS must be achieved for threshold vesting of 25% under the EPS performance measure with 
maximum vesting at 10% per annum. A return of at least 30% must be achieved for threshold vesting of 25% under the ROCE 
performance measure with a maximum vesting of 100% at a return of 36%. For awards to be made in 2017 the performance 
targets and weightings remain unchanged.

88  De La Rue  Annual Report 2017 Total pension entitlements (audited)
The Group’s UK pension schemes are funded, HMRC registered and approved schemes. They include both defined contribution 
and defined benefit pension schemes. 
None of the Executive Directors was a member of the legacy defined benefit schemes. All of the Executive Directors have opted 
out of the defined contribution plan and receive a cash allowance in lieu of a pension contribution.
During the year Martin Sutherland received a cash allowance of 30% of his basic salary in lieu of a pension contribution and Jitesh 
Sodha and Rupert Middleton each received a cash allowance of 20% of basic salary in lieu of pension contributions. The cash 
allowances were reduced by the amount of the Company’s national insurance contribution to ensure cost neutrality with making 
the same contribution to the pension plan. 
Details of the payments made to the Executive Directors are included on page 84.
Payments for loss of office (audited)
There were no payments for loss of office during the period.
Payments to past Directors (audited)
There were no payments to past Directors during the period in respect of services provided to the Company as a Director.
External directorships of Executive Directors
The Board considers whether it is appropriate for an Executive Director to serve as a non-executive director of another company. 
Martin Sutherland was appointed a non-executive director of Forterra plc with effect from 23 May 2017 and his entitlement to 
a fee in respect of this appointment will be reported in the 2018 annual report. 
Share retention policy
The Remuneration Committee believes it is important that the interests of Executive Directors should be closely aligned with 
those of shareholders. Under the existing policy, Executive Directors are encouraged to build up a shareholding over five years, 
equivalent to one times salary. This may be achieved either through market share purchases or retention of vested share awards. 
Under the new remuneration policy to be proposed at the 2017 AGM it is intended that this be met by the Executive Directors 
retaining 100% of vested post-tax deferred bonus shares, restricted shares and performance shares until the requirement 
is met in full.
Directors’ interests in shares (audited)

Notes

 The votes ‘For’ include votes given at the Chairman’s discretion.
2
 A vote ‘Withheld’ is not a vote in law and, as such, is not counted in the calculation of the proportion of votes ‘For’ and ‘Against’. 
De La Rue carefully monitors shareholder voting on the remuneration policy and implementation and the Company recognises the 
importance of ensuring that shareholders continue to support the remuneration arrangements. All voting at the AGM is undertaken 
by poll.
Remuneration advice
The Remuneration Committee consults with the Chief Executive Officer on the remuneration of executives directly reporting to him 
and other senior executives and seeks to ensure a consistent approach across the Group taking account of seniority and market 
practice and the key remuneration policies outlined in this report. During 2016/17, the Committee also received advice from Willis 
Towers Watson. Willis Towers Watson has been formally appointed by the Remuneration Committee and advised on the review of 
the directors’ remuneration policy, executive remuneration levels and trends, directors’ remuneration report preparation and target 
setting for incentive plans. The Remuneration Committee requests Willis Towers Watson to attend meetings periodically during 
the year.
Willis Towers Watson is a member of the Remuneration Consultants’ Group and has signed up to the code of conduct relating 
to the provision of executive remuneration advice in the UK. In light of this, and the level and nature of the service received, the 
Committee remains satisfied that the advice has been objective and independent. 
Total fees for advice provided to the Remuneration Committee during the year by Willis Towers Watson were £53,000.
Dilution limits
The share incentives operated by the Company comply with the institutional investors’ share dilution guidelines.
The directors’ remuneration report was approved by the Board on 23 May 2017 and signed on its behalf.
Statutory requirements 
The directors’ remuneration report has been prepared on behalf of the Board by the Committee.
The directors’ remuneration report has been prepared in accordance with the provisions of the Large and Medium-sized 
Companies and Groups (Accounts and Reports) (Amendment) Regulations 2013. It also meets the requirements of the UK Listing 
Authority’s Listing Rules and the Disclosure and Transparency Rules. 
The Companies Act 2006 and the Listing Rules require the Company’s auditor to report on the audited information in their report 
on pages 97 to 101 and to state that this section has been properly prepared in accordance with these regulations.

92  De La Rue  Annual Report 2017 Introduction
De La Rue plc is a public limited 
company, registered in England 
and Wales incorporated under the 
Companies Act 1985 with registered 
number 3834125 and has its registered 
office at De La Rue House, Jays Close, 
Viables, Basingstoke, Hampshire, 
RG22 4BS.
Directors’ report and 
strategic report
The Directors of the Company are 
required to produce a directors’ 
report on an annual basis under the 
Companies Act 2006. The Directors are 
also required under the Companies Act 
2006 to publish a strategic report for the 
Group and the Company. The directors’ 
strategic report must:
• Contain a fair review of the Company’s 
business and a description of the 
principal risks and uncertainties facing 
the business 
• Be a balanced and comprehensive 
analysis of the development and 
performance of the Company’s 
business at the end of that year, 
consistent with the size and complexity 
of its business
This section of the annual report sets out 
the information required to be disclosed 
by the Company and the Group in the 
directors’ report. Certain matters that 
would otherwise be disclosed in this 
directors’ report have been reported 
elsewhere in this annual report and 
consequently this directors’ report 
should be read in conjunction with the 
strategic report on pages 1 to 49 and 
the corporate governance statement on 
pages 50 to 92 which are incorporated 
by reference into this directors’ report.
Under the Companies Act 2006, a safe 
harbour limits the liability of Directors in 
respect of statements in and omissions 
from the strategic report and the 
directors’ report. Under English law, 
the Directors would be liable to the 
Company, but not to any third party, 
if the strategic report or the directors’ 
report contains errors as a result of 
recklessness or knowing misstatement 
or dishonest concealment of a material 
fact, but would not otherwise be liable.
Management report
The strategic report and this directors’ 
report together with other sections 
of this annual report incorporated by 
reference, when taken as a whole, form 
the management report as required 
for the purposes of Disclosure and 
Transparency Rule 4.1.5R.

Dividends
An interim dividend of 8.3p was paid 
on 11 January 2017 in respect of the 
half year ended 24 September 2016. 
The Board is recommending a final 
dividend of 16.7p per share, making 
a total for the year of 25.0p per share 
(2015/16: 25.0p per share). 
Dividend details are given in note 8 
of the financial statements. Subject to 
approval of shareholders at the AGM 
on 20 July 2017, the final dividend 
will be paid on 3 August 2017 to 
those shareholders on the register 
on 30 June 2017.
Share capital 
As at 25 March 2017, there were 
101,767,263 ordinary shares of 44
152/175
p 
each and 111,673,300 deferred shares 
of 1p each in issue.
Deferred shares carry limited economic 
rights and no voting rights. They are not 
transferable except in accordance with 
the articles of association. 
The ordinary shares are listed on the 
London Stock Exchange.
Rights and restrictions on shares 
and transfers of shares
The rights and obligations attaching to 
the Company’s ordinary and deferred 
shares, in addition to those conferred 
on their holders by law, are set out in 
the Company’s articles of association, 
copies of which can be obtained from 
Companies House in the UK or the 
Group’s website www.delarue.com. 
The key points are summarised below.
Voting
On a show of hands at a general 
meeting of the Company, each holder 
of ordinary shares present in person 
and entitled to vote shall have one vote 
and, on a poll, every member present in 
person or by proxy and entitled to vote 
shall have one vote for every ordinary 
share held. Electronic and paper proxy 
appointments, and voting instructions, 
must be received by the Company’s 
Registrar no later than 48 hours before 
a general meeting.
Exercise of rights of shares 
in employee share schemes
Awards held by relevant participants 
under the Company’s various share 
plans carry no voting rights until the 
shares are issued. The Trustee of the 
De La Rue Employee Share Ownership 
Trust does not seek to exercise voting 
rights on existing shares held in the 
employee trust. No shares are currently 
held in trust.
Report of Directors
Strategic report Corporate governance Accounts
 Annual Report 2017  De La Rue  93 Report of Directors continued
Dividends and distributions 
to shareholders on winding up 
Holders of ordinary shares may receive 
interim dividends approved by Directors 
and dividends declared in general 
meetings. On a liquidation and subject 
to a special resolution of the Company 
the liquidator may divide among 
members in specie the whole or any part 
of the assets of the Company and may, 
for such purpose, value any assets and 
may determine how such division shall 
be carried out.
Transfers of shares
The Company’s articles of association 
place no restrictions on the transfer of 
ordinary shares or on the exercise of 
voting rights attached to them except 
in very limited circumstances (such as 
a transfer to more than four persons). 
Certain restrictions, however, may 
from time to time be imposed by laws 
and regulations, such as the Financial 
Conduct Authority’s Listing Rules, the 
City Code on Takeovers and Mergers 
or any other regulations.
Dealings subject to the Listing Rules 
and EU Market Abuse Regulation
In accordance with the Listing Rules of 
the Financial Conduct Authority and EU 
Market Abuse Regulation, Directors and 
other persons discharging managerial 
responsibilities of the Company, and 
in each case, any persons closely 
associated with them, are required to 
seek the prior approval of the Company 
to deal in the ordinary shares of 
the Company. 
Shareholder agreements and consent 
requirements
There are no known arrangements under 
which financial rights carried by any of 
the shares in the Company are held 
by a person other than holders of the 
shares. The Company is not aware of 
any agreements between shareholders 
that may result in any restriction on 
the transfer of shares or exercise of 
voting rights.
Power to issue and allot 
At the AGM in 2016, authority was 
given to the Directors to allot new 
ordinary shares up to a nominal value of 
£30,327,036, equivalent to two-thirds of 
the issued ordinary share capital of the 
Company, providing that, consistent with 
the Investment Association’s guidelines, 
any amount in excess of one-third of the 
existing issued shares should be applied 
to fully pre-emptive rights only.
At the same meeting, pursuant to 
section 570 of the Companies Act 
2006, shareholders approved the 
issue of shares for cash up to the 
maximum nominal value of £4,549,055, 
representing approximately 10% of 
the Company’s issued ordinary share 
capital (5% of which is only to be 
used in connection with an acquisition 
or specified capital investment) in 
each case without the application 
of pre-emption rights. 
Resolutions to renew, for a period of 
one year, the power of Directors to allot 
shares without regard to the pre-emption 
provisions of the Companies Act 2006 
will be sought from shareholders at 
the AGM.
Details of shares issued during the year 
and outstanding options are given in 
notes 19 and 20 on pages 135 to 138 
which form part of this report. Details of 
the share incentives in place are provided 
on pages 86 to 88 of the directors’ 
remuneration report.
Authority to purchase own shares
At the 2016 AGM, shareholders gave 
the Company authority to purchase up 
to 10,138,623 of its own ordinary shares 
representing 10% of its issued ordinary 
share capital either for cancellation or 
to be held in treasury (or a combination 
of these). No purchases have been 
made pursuant to this authority and 
a resolution will be put to shareholders 
at the 2017 AGM to renew the authority 
for a further period of one year.
Substantial shareholdings
As at 23 May 2017, the Company had received formal notification of the following holdings in its shares under the Disclosure 
and Transparency Rules of the Financial Conduct Authority. It should be noted that these holdings may have changed since 
the Company was notified, however notification of any change is not required until the next notifiable threshold is crossed.

Board are summarised on page 50 of the

Details of Directors’ remuneration are 
provided in the directors’ remuneration 
report on pages 74 to 92. The interests 
of the Directors and their families in the 
share capital of the Company are shown 
on page 89 of the directors’ remuneration 
report which also includes information on 
the Company contracts of service with its 
Directors on page 88.
Appointment and removal of Directors
Rules regarding the appointment and 
removal of Directors are set out in the 
Company’s articles of association.
Powers of Directors
Subject to the Company’s articles 
of association, the Companies Act 
2006 and any directions given by the 
Company in general meeting by a special 
resolution, the business of the Company 
is managed by the Board who may 
exercise all the powers of the Company, 
whether relating to the management 
of the business of the Company or not. 
The powers of the Board are described 
in the corporate governance statement 
on pages 56 to 60.
Indemnity
At the date of this report, the Company 
has agreed, to the extent permitted by 
the law and the Company’s articles of 
association, to indemnify Directors and 
officers in respect of all costs, charges, 
losses, damages and expenses arising 
out of claims made against them in the 
course of the execution of their duties as 
a Director or officer of the Company or 
any associated company. The Company 
may advance defence costs in civil or 
regulatory proceedings on such terms 
as the Board may reasonably determine 
but any advance must be refunded if 
the Director or officer is subsequently 
convicted. The indemnity will not provide 
cover where the Director or officer has 
acted fraudulently or dishonestly. 
The Group also maintains directors’ and 
officers’ liability insurance cover for its 
Directors and officers. This cover extends 
to directors of subsidiary companies.
Amendment of articles 
of association
The articles of association may be 
amended by special resolution of 
the shareholders. 
Change of control 
Contracts
There are a number of contracts which 
allow the counterparties to alter or 
terminate those arrangements in the 
event of a change of control of the 
Company. These arrangements are 
commercially sensitive and confidential 
and their disclosure could be seriously 
prejudicial to the Group.
Banking facilities
The £250m credit facility between the 
Company and its key relationship banks 
contains a provision such that, in the 
event of a change of control, any lender 
may, if it so requires, notify the agent 
that it wishes to cancel its commitment 
whereupon the commitment of that 
lender will be cancelled and all its 
outstanding loans, together with accrued 
interest, will become immediately due 
and payable.
A proposal to increase the current 
borrowing limit of £250m specified in 
the articles of association will be put 
to shareholders at the 2017 AGM as 
detailed in the notice of AGM.
Employee share plans
In the event of a change of control, 
automatic vesting would occur in 
accordance with the relevant scheme 
or plan rules.
Political donations
The Group’s policy is not to make 
any political donations and none were 
made during the period. However, it is 
possible that certain routine activities 
may unintentionally fall within the broad 
scope of the Companies Act 2006 
provisions relating to political donations 
and expenditure. As in previous years, 
the Company will therefore propose to 
shareholders at the forthcoming AGM 
that the authority granted at the AGM in 
July 2016 regarding political donations 
be renewed.
Essential contracts 
or other arrangements
The Group has a number of suppliers 
of key components, the loss of which 
could disrupt the Group’s ability to deliver 
on time and in full. See more details on 
page 35.
Related party transactions
Related party transactions are set out 
in note 27 to the financial statements.
Financial instruments
Details of the Group’s financial 
instruments are set out in note 13 to the

statements for more details).

Statement of Directors’ 
responsibilities in respect 
of the annual report and the 
financial statements
The Directors are responsible for 
preparing the annual report and the 
Group and Parent Company financial 
statements in accordance with applicable 
law and regulations. 
Under that law they are required to 
prepare the Group financial statements 
in accordance with IFRS as adopted 
by the EU and applicable law and have 
elected to prepare the Parent Company 
financial statements in accordance with 
UK Accounting Standards, including FRS 
102 The Financial Reporting Standard 
applicable in the UK and Republic of 
Ireland, and applicable law. 
Under company law the Directors must 
not approve the financial statements 
unless they are satisfied that they give 
a true and fair view of the state of affairs 
of the Group and Parent Company and 
of their profit or loss for that period. 
In preparing each of the Group and 
Parent Company financial statements, 
the Directors are required to: 
• Select suitable accounting policies 
and then apply them consistently
• Make judgements and estimates that 
are reasonable and prudent
• For the Group financial statements, 
state whether they have been prepared 
in accordance with IFRS as adopted 
by the EU
• For the Parent Company financial 
statements, state whether applicable 
UK Accounting Standards have 
been followed, subject to any 
material departures disclosed and 
explained in the Parent Company 
financial statements
• Prepare the financial statements 
on the going concern basis unless 
it is inappropriate to presume that the 
Group and the Parent Company will 
continue in business
The Directors are responsible for keeping 
adequate accounting records that are 
sufficient to show and explain the Parent 
Company and Group’s transactions and 
disclose with reasonable accuracy at any 
time the financial position of the Parent 
Company and enable them to ensure 
that its financial statements comply with 
the Companies Act 2006. They have 
general responsibility for taking such 
steps as are reasonably open to them 
to safeguard the assets of the Group 
and to prevent and detect fraud and 
other irregularities.
Under applicable law and regulations, 
the Directors are also responsible for 
preparing a strategic report, directors’ 
report, directors’ remuneration report 
and corporate governance statement 
that comply with that law and 
those regulations. 
The Directors are responsible for 
the maintenance and integrity of the 
corporate and financial information 
included on the Group’s website. 
Legislation in the UK governing the 
preparation and dissemination of financial 
statements may differ from legislation 
in other jurisdictions.
Directors’ responsibility statement 
Each of the persons who is a Director 
at the date of approval of this report 
confirms that to the best of his or 
her knowledge:
• The Group financial statements, 
prepared in accordance with IFRS as 
adopted by the EU, give a true and fair 
view of the assets, liabilities, financial 
position and profit of the Company 
and the undertakings included in the 
consolidation taken as a whole
• The strategic report on pages 1 to 
49 and the directors’ report on pages 
50 to 96 include a fair review of the 
development and performance of 
the business and the position of the 
Group and the undertakings included 
in the consolidation taken as a whole, 
together with a description of the 
principal risks and uncertainties that 
they face; and
• The annual report and accounts, 
taken as a whole, are fair, balanced 
and understandable and provide the 
information necessary for shareholders 
to assess the Group’s financial 
position, performance, business model 
and strategy

report were approved by the Board 
on 23 May 2017.

2. Our assessment of risks of material misstatement
In arriving at our audit opinion above on the financial statements, the risks of material misstatement that had the greatest 
effect on our audit, in decreasing order of audit significance, were as follows.  In the prior period we identified the presentation 
of discontinued operations and assets held for sale as an event driven risk.
The risk Our response
Revenue recognition in the 
Currency division
£350.6 million; (2016: £353.3 
million)
Refer to page 66 (Audit Committee 
Report), page 109 (accounting 
policy) and page 110 (financial 
disclosures).
Accounting treatment
Certain customer contracts in the 
Currency division include specific
terms, for example, complex 
acceptance criteria or ‘bill and hold’ 
clauses where the customer asks the 
division to store finished products on 
its behalf. Due to these contractual 
complexities there is a risk that 
revenue may be recorded in the
incorrect reporting period.
Our procedures included:
Accounting analysis:  reading selected new 
contracts to obtain an understanding of their key 
terms, in particular those relevant to the timing of 
revenue recognition, and assessing management’s 
related revenue recognition policy.
Control design and re-performance: evaluating 
and testing the key controls designed to ensure 
that revenue is recognised in the correct 
accounting period.
Testing application: testing, on a sample basis, 
revenue recognition on contracts with complex 
acceptance conditions. In relation to revenue 
recorded under ‘bill and hold’ transactions we 
evaluated the underlying contractual arrangements 
and obtained customer documentation that 
demonstrates when the risks and rewards of 
ownership have been transferred.  For selected 
revenue transactions recorded before and after the 
year end, confirming that they are recorded in the 
correct accounting period.
Assessing transparency: assessing the adequacy 
of the Group’s disclosure about significant 
judgements in relation to revenue recognition.
Valuation of inventory in the 
Currency Division
£53.2 million; (2016: £54.7 million)
Refer to page 66 (Audit Committee 
Report), page 109 (accounting 
policy) and page 122 (financial 
disclosures).
Subjective estimate
At the balance sheet date the Group 
has significant inventory, including 
work in progress on customer 
banknote orders. Production of 
banknote paper, printed banknotes and 
other security products is a complex 
process reflecting the tight 
specifications set by customers and the 
many embedded security features 
which are often bespoke to each 
product.
Accordingly, there is a risk that work in 
progress will fail quality control checks 
at a later stage in production and need 
to be scrapped or reworked. The Group 
provides for this through allowances 
based on past experience and known 
issues but there is a risk that this 
allowance will be misstated.
Finished goods inventory is valued at 
the lower of cost and net realisable 
value. Due to the bespoke nature of 
each product, fluctuations in production 
efficiency and spoilage rates could 
affect the allocated cost and carrying 
amount of inventory.
Our procedures included:
Control design and re-performance: evaluating 
and testing the Group’s controls over the 
determination of inventory allowances.
Our business knowledge: assessing the 
adequacy of estimates used by reference to 
historical experience, current manufacturing quality 
and specific issues such as current and recent 
customer complaints.  
Personnel interviews: challenging judgements 
through interviews with the quality control and 
sales functions in relation to quality performance 
levels and overall customer satisfaction.
Independent re-performance: sample re-
performance of management’s calculations of 
inventory valuation allowance.  Re-performance of 
the allocation of costs to work in progress and 
finished goods inventory and assessing the 
allocation approach.
Tests of detail: testing the net realisable value by 
reference to the selling prices relevant for each 
product.
Assessing transparency: assessing the adequacy 
of the Group’s disclosures in relation to the 
significant judgements in relation to the carrying 
value of inventory including work in progress.
98  De La Rue  Annual Report 2017 The risk Our response
Acquisition accounting
£7.2 million intangible assets
Refer to page 66 (Audit 
Committee Report), page 
109 (accounting policy) and 
page 147 (financial 
disclosures).
Subjective valuation
On 6 January 2017, the Group completed 
the acquisition of the Authentication 
business of DuPont Electronics & 
Communications for a cash consideration 
of $25m.
The determination of separately
identifiable intangible assets arising on 
business combinations is inherently 
judgemental and valuation of these 
assets is complex and sensitive to 
underlying assumptions around future 
cash flows and discount rates.
Our procedures included:
Assessing base data and valuer credentials: assessing the 
credentials of the third party engaged by management to 
support this valuation and considering the appropriateness of 
the base data used in the valuation, such as historical customer 
churn rates.
Our experience: assessing the appropriateness and 
completeness of the separate intangible assets identified by 
applying our professional experience to the information 
obtained from our inspection of purchase agreements and 
board minutes and inquiries.
Evaluating assumptions: assessing, with support from our 
own valuation specialists in specific areas, the Group’s 
valuation analysis which was the basis for the determination of 
the fair value of the intangible assets. We critically challenged 
the key assumptions, and in particular evaluated the 
reasonableness of assumptions underlying the future trading 
forecasts, growth rates and the discount rate applied in the 
valuations. In performing this assessment we had regard to the 
performance of the existing business and trading forecasts for 
operations acquired, including considering the historical 
accuracy of forecasts.
Assessing transparency: assessing the adequacy of the 
Group’s disclosures regarding the judgements applied in 
identifying and valuing the acquisition-related intangibles. 
Classification of 
exceptional items
£4.5 million; (2016: £29.6
million)
Refer to page 66 (Audit 
Committee Report), page 
109 (accounting policy) and 
page 113-114 (financial 
disclosures).
Presentation appropriateness
The Group discloses separately 
‘exceptional items’ which the directors 
consider to be items of income or 
expense which are important to identify 
to shareholders to aid their understanding 
of the ‘underlying’ business performance. 
Determining which items are disclosed 
as exceptional is judgemental. 
Accordingly, there is a risk that 
inappropriate selection and disclosure of 
exceptional items may result in the 
Group not meeting its’ objective of giving 
a view of company performance that is 
fair, balanced and understandable. 
Our procedures included:
Assessing principles: assessing, using our professional 
experience, the appropriateness of the Group’s policy on
determination of exceptional items.
Assessing application and balance: assessing whether the 
application of the stated policy is appropriate and has been 
applied consistently with regard to the need for balance based 
on our understanding of the Group’s activities and results for 
the period.  Challenging whether other items should be 
disclosed as exceptional.
Assessing transparency: assessing the adequacy of the 
Group’s disclosures around the definition and composition of 
exceptional items.
Warranty provisioning
£7.0 million; (2016: £5.9
million)
Refer to page 66 (Audit 
Committee Report), page 
109 (accounting policy) and 
page 135 (financial 
disclosures).
Subjective estimate
As noted with inventory valuation in the 
Currency division, the Group’s products 
are complex and produced to exacting 
standards. Product quality issues can be 
identified subsequent to delivery to 
customers. Accordingly, at any point in 
time the Group may be in dialogue with 
customers over potential product quality 
issues.
The Group holds provisions for the 
potential costs associated with these 
risks. The assumptions underpinning 
these provisions are inherently uncertain.
Our procedures included:
Control design and re-performance: evaluating and testing 
the Group’s controls over the determination of warranty
provisions.
Tests of detail: in relation to known issues, assessing the 
Group’s risk assessment, considering the status of discussions 
with the customer (including inspecting correspondence) and 
then testing and challenging the basis of the Group’s 
calculations including the rectification or remediation cost 
estimates. In performing these we have regard to past 
experience in addressing such matters.
In relation to potentially unidentified issues, assessing the 
Group’s methodology for determining the level of provision 
required taking into account key assumptions such as historical 
accuracy of provisioning, the levels of expense incurred over 
time together with current quality experience.
Assessing transparency: assessing the adequacy of the 
Group’s disclosures in relation to the significant judgements in 
relation to warranty provisioning and related contingent 
liabilities, if relevant.

3. Our application of materiality and an 
overview of the scope of our audit
Materiality for the Group financial statements as a 
whole was set at £2.3 million (2016: £2.3 million), 
determined with reference to a benchmark of Group 
profit from continuing operations before tax, 
normalised to remove the impact of separately 
identified exceptional items (as disclosed in note 4 
of the financial statements) of which it represents 
3.9% (2016: 3.9% of group profit before tax, 
continuing and discontinued, normalised to exclude 
exceptional items).
We reported to the Audit Committee any corrected 
or uncorrected identified misstatements exceeding 
£115,000 (2016: £115,000), in addition to any other 
identified misstatements that warranted reporting 
on qualitative grounds.
Of the group’s 59 (2016: 70) reporting components, 
we subjected 12 (2016: 12) to audits for group 
reporting purposes and six (2016: six) to specified, 
risk-focused, audit procedures.
The graphs to the right demonstrate how 
components within the scope of our work 
accounted for, as percentages of, the group’s 
results from continuing operations. 
The components for which we performed specified 
risk-focused audit procedures were not individually 
financially significant enough to require an audit for 
group reporting purposes, but did present specific 
individual risks that needed to be addressed.  For 
the remaining components, we performed analysis 
at an aggregated group level to re-examine our 
assessment that there were no significant risks of 
material misstatement within these.  
The Group audit team instructed component 
auditors as to the significant areas to be covered, 
including the relevant risks detailed above and the 
information to be reported back.

Subjective valuation
Small changes in the assumptions and 
estimates used to value the Group’s 
post-retirement benefit obligation (before 
deducting scheme assets) would have a 
significant effect on the Group’s post-
retirement deficit.
Our procedures included:
Assessing valuer credentials:  assessing the 
credentials of the third party engaged by 
management to support this valuation. 
Benchmarking assumptions: challenging, with 
the support of our own actuarial specialists, the key 
assumptions applied, being the discount rate, 
inflation rate and mortality/life expectancy, against 
externally derived data. 
Assessing transparency: assessing the adequacy 
of the Group’s disclosures in respect of the 
sensitivity of the deficit to these assumptions.
100  De La Rue  Annual Report 2017 The Group audit team approved the component materiality 
levels used, which ranged from £0.1 million to £1.8 million 
(2016: £0.1 million to £1.8 million), having regard to the mix of 
size and risk profile of the Group across the components. The 
work on six of the 18 components (2016: six of the 18 
components) was performed by component auditors and the 
rest by the Group audit team.  
The Group audit team visited four (2016: three) component 
locations in the UK, and Kenya (2016: in the UK), to assess the 
audit risk and strategy.  Telephone conference meetings were 
held with all component auditors and file reviews were 
conducted remotely or during the visit to the component 
location.  At these visits and meetings, the findings reported to 
the Group audit team were discussed in more detail, and any 
further work required by the Group audit team was then 
performed by the component auditor.  
4. Our opinion on other matters prescribed by the 
Companies Act 2006 is unmodified
In our opinion:
— the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be 
audited has been properly prepared in accordance with 
the Companies Act 2006; and
— the information given in the Strategic Report and the 
Directors’ Report for the financial period is consistent 
with the financial statements.
Based solely on the work required to be undertaken in the 
course of the audit of the financial statements and from 
reading the Strategic Report and the Directors’ Report:
— we have not identified material misstatements in those 
reports; and  
— in our opinion, those reports have been prepared in 
accordance with the Companies Act 2006. 
5. We have nothing to report on the disclosures of 
principal risks
Based on the knowledge we acquired during our audit, we 
have nothing material to add or draw attention to in relation 
to:
— the directors’ statement of the longer-term viability on 
page 37, concerning the principal risks, their 
management, and, based on that, the directors’ 
assessment and expectations of the group’s continuing 
in operation over the three years to March 2020; or
— the disclosures on page 107 of the financial statements 
concerning the use of the going concern basis of 
accounting.
6. We have nothing to report in respect of the matters 
on which we are required to report by exception
Under ISAs (UK and Ireland) we are required to report to 
you if, based on the knowledge we acquired during our 
audit, we have identified other information in the annual 
report that contains a material inconsistency with either that 
knowledge or the financial statements, a material 
misstatement of fact, or that is otherwise misleading.
In particular, we are required to report to you if:
— we have identified material inconsistencies between 
the knowledge we acquired during our audit and the 
directors’ statement that they consider that the annual 
report and financial statements taken as a whole is fair, 
balanced and understandable and provides the 
information necessary for shareholders to assess the 
group’s position and performance, business model and 
strategy; or
— the Audit Committee Report on pages 65 to 68 does 
not appropriately address matters communicated by us 
to the Audit Committee. 
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to 
you if, in our opinion:
— adequate accounting records have not been kept by the 
parent company, or returns adequate for our audit have 
not been received from branches not visited by us; or
— the parent company financial statements and the part 
of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited are 
not in agreement with the accounting records and 
returns; or
— certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration specified 
by law are not made; or
— we have not received all the information and 
explanations we require for our audit.
Under the Listing Rules we are required to review:  
— the directors’ statements, set out on pages 37 and 107, 
in relation to going concern and longer-term viability; 
and   
— the part of the Corporate Governance Report on pages  
50 to 73 relating to the company’s compliance with the 
eleven provisions of the 2014 UK Corporate 
Governance Code specified for our review.
We have nothing to report in respect of the above 
responsibilities.  
Scope and responsibilities
As explained more fully in the Directors’ Responsibilities 
Statement set out on page 96, the directors are responsible for 
the preparation of the financial statements and for being 
satisfied that they give a true and fair view. A description of the 
scope of an audit of financial statements is provided on the 
Financial Reporting Council’s website at 
www.frc.org.uk/auditscopeukprivate. This report is made solely 
to the Company’s members as a body and is subject to 
important explanations and disclaimers regarding our 
responsibilities, published on our website at 
www.kpmg.com/uk/auditscopeukco2014a, which are 
incorporated into this report as if set out in full and should be 
read to provide an understanding of the purpose of this report,

Share premium account
This reserve arises from the issuance of shares for consideration in excess of their nominal value.
Capital redemption reserve
This reserve represents the nominal value of shares redeemed by the Company.
Hedge reserve
This reserve records the portion of any gain or loss on hedging instruments that are determined to be effective cash flow hedges. 
When the hedged transaction occurs, the gain or loss on the hedging instrument is transferred out of equity to the income 
statement. If a forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, the gain or loss on the related hedging instrument previously 
recognised in equity is transferred to the income statement. 
Cumulative translation adjustment
This reserve records cumulative exchange differences arising from the translation of the financial statements of foreign entities 
since transition to IFRS. Upon disposal of foreign operations, the related accumulated exchange differences are recycled to the 
income statement. This reserve also records the effect of hedging net investments in foreign operations.
Other reserve
On 1 February 2000, the Company issued and credited as fully paid 191,646,873 ordinary shares of 25p each and paid cash 
of £103.7m to acquire the issued share capital of De La Rue plc (now De La Rue Holdings Limited), following the approval 
of a High Court Scheme of Arrangement. In exchange for every 20 ordinary shares in De La Rue plc, shareholders received 
17 ordinary shares plus 920p in cash. The other reserve of £83.8m arose as a result of this transaction and is a permanent 
adjustment to the consolidated financial statements.

106  De La Rue  Annual Report 2017 The Company
De La Rue plc (the Company) is a 
public limited company incorporated 
and domiciled in the United Kingdom. 
The address of its registered office is 
disclosed on page 156 of this Annual 
Report. The consolidated financial 
statements of the Company for the 
period ended 25 March 2017 comprise 
the Company and its subsidiaries 
(together referred to as the Group) 
and the Group’s interest in associates. 
The Company financial statements 
present information about the Company 
as a separate entity and not about its 
Group. The principal activities of the 
Group are described in note 1. 
Statement of compliance
European Union (EU) law (IAS Regulation 
EC 1606/2002) requires that the 
consolidated financial statements, for the 
period ended 25 March 2017 , be prepared 
in accordance with international financial 
reporting standards (IFRS) as adopted 
by the EU. These consolidated financial 
statements have been approved by the 
Directors and prepared in accordance 
with IFRS including interpretations 
issued by the International Accounting 
Standards Board.
Basis of preparation
The consolidated financial statements 
have been prepared under the historical 
cost convention with the exception of 
certain items which are measured at 
fair value as disclosed in the accounting 
policies below. The accounts have been 
prepared as at 25 March 2017, being the 
last Saturday in March. The comparatives 
for the 2015/16 financial period are for 
the period ended 26 March 2016.
The Company has elected to prepare its 
financial statements in accordance with 
FRS 102 Financial Reporting Standard 
applicable in the UK and Republic of 
Ireland. They are set out on pages 148 
to 152 and the accounting policies 
in respect of the Company financial 
statements are set out on page 150.
The principal accounting policies 
adopted in the preparation of these 
consolidated financial statements are 
set out below or have been incorporated 
with the relevant notes to the accounts 
where appropriate. These policies 
have been consistently applied to 
all the periods presented, unless 
otherwise stated.
The Group’s business activities, together 
with the factors likely to affect its future 
development, performance and position 
are set out on pages 4 to 41 of the 
Strategic report. In addition, pages 124 
to 132 include the Group’s objectives, 
policies and processes for financial 
risk management, details of its financial 
instruments and hedging activities and 
its exposure to credit risk, liquidity risk 
and commodity pricing risk. The financial 
position of the Group, its cash flows, 
liquidity position and borrowing facilities 
are described on page 39 of the 
Strategic report. 
The Group meets its funding requirements 
through cash generated from operations 
and a revolving credit facility which 
expires in December 2021. The Group’s 
forecasts and projections, which cover 
a period of more than 12 months, 
taking into account reasonably possible 
changes in normal trading performance, 
show that the Group should be able 
to operate within its currently available 
facilities. The Group has sufficient financial 
resources together with assets that are 
expected to generate cash flow in the 
normal course of business. 
As a consequence and notwithstanding 
the net liability position being reported 
in the consolidated balance sheet, 
which has primarily arisen due to the 
value of the deficit in the retirement 
benefit obligations, the Directors have 
a reasonable expectation that the 
Company and the Group are well placed 
to manage their business risks and to 
continue in operational existence for 
the foreseeable future. Accordingly, the 
Directors continue to adopt the going 
concern basis in preparing the annual 
report and accounts.
Accounting developments during 
the period
During the period a number of 
amendments to IFRS became effective 
and were adopted by the Group, none 
of which had a material impact on the 
Group’s net cash flows, financial position, 
total comprehensive income or earnings 
per share.
Changes to IFRS not yet adopted
A number of other new and amended 
IFRS were issued during the period, 
which do not become effective until after 
25 March 2017.
IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts 
with Customers (effective for the year 
ending 30 March 2019, provides a single, 
principles based, five step model to be 
applied to all sales contracts.. The group 
continues to assess the impact of the 
new standard.
IFRS 16 Leases was issued by the 
IASB in January 2016 (effective for the 
year ending 28 March 2020, not yet 
endorsed by the EU) replaces IAS 17. 
Under the new standard it requires 
lessees to recognise a lease liability and 
a right of use asset for all leases unless 
the lease term is 12 months or less or 
the underlying asset has a low value. 
Interest expense on the lease liability and 
depreciation on the right of use asset will 
be recognised in the income statement, 
resulting in a higher total charge to the 
income statement in the initial years of 
a lease. IFRS 16 is not expected at the 
current time to have a significant impact 
on the results of the group. The group 
will continue to assess the impact 
during 2017/18.
IFRS 9 Financial Instruments was 
issued by the IASB in July 2014. 
IFRS 9 introduces new requirements 
for the classification, measurement and 
impairment of financial instruments and 
hedge accounting, and is required to be 
adopted by 29 March 2019. The group 
is reviewing the standard to determine 
the likely impact.
Accounting policies
 Annual Report 2017  De La Rue  107
Corporate governance Accounts Strategic report Accounting policies continued
Basis of consolidation
The consolidated financial statements 
incorporate the financial statements of 
the Company and entities controlled 
by the Company (its subsidiaries) up 
to 25 March 2017. Control exists when 
the Group has the power to direct the 
activities of an entity so as to affect 
the return on investment. The results 
of subsidiaries acquired or disposed 
of during the period are included in 
the consolidated financial statements 
from the date that control commences 
or until the date that control ceases. 
The majority of the subsidiaries prepare 
their financial statements up to 25 March.
Business combinations
Acquisitions of subsidiaries and 
businesses are accounted for using 
the acquisition method of accounting. 
The Consideration transferred in the 
acquisition is measured at fair value 
as are the identifiable assets and 
liabilities acquired.
The excess of the fair value of 
consideration transferred over the fair 
value of net assets acquired is accounted 
for as goodwill. Any goodwill that arises 
is tested annually for impairment. 
Transaction costs are expensed 
as incurred. 
Significant accounting policies
The significant accounting policies 
adopted in the preparation of these 
consolidated financial statements have 
been incorporated into the relevant notes 
where possible. General accounting 
policies which are not specific to an 
accounting note, for example foreign 
exchange, are set out below.
Foreign currency
Foreign currency transactions
These financial statements are presented 
in sterling, which is the functional and 
presentational currency of the Company. 
The functional currency of Group entities 
is principally determined by the primary 
economic environment in which the 
respective entity operates. 
Transactions in foreign currencies entered 
into by Group entities are translated 
into the functional currencies of those 
entities at the rates of exchange at the 
date of the transaction. Monetary assets 
and liabilities denominated in foreign 
currencies at the balance sheet date are 
translated at the rate of exchange ruling 
at that date. Foreign exchange differences 
arising on translation are recognised 
in the income statement.
Foreign currency non-monetary items 
measured in terms of historical cost 
are translated at the rate of exchange 
at the date of the transaction. 
Exchange differences on non-monetary 
items are recognised in line with whether 
the gain or loss on the non-monetary 
item itself is recognised in the income 
statement or in equity.
In order to hedge its exposure to certain 
foreign exchange risks, the Group enters 
into forward contracts. Refer to note 13 
for details of the Group’s accounting 
policies in respect of such derivative 
financial instruments.
Financial statements  
of foreign operations
Assets and liabilities of foreign 
operations, including goodwill and 
intangible assets, are translated at the 
exchange rate prevailing at the balance 
sheet date. Income and expenses 
are translated at average exchange 
rates (which approximate to actual 
rates). Exchange differences arising 
on re-translation are recognised in the 
Group’s translation reserve, which is a 
component of equity. When a foreign 
operation is sold, exchange differences 
that were recorded in equity are 
recognised in the income statement 
as part of the gain or loss on sale.
Exchange differences in respect of 
foreign operations that arose before 
27 March 2004, the date of transition 
to Adopted IFRS, are presented as 
part of retained earnings, as permitted 
by IFRS 1.
Net investment in foreign operations
Foreign currency differences arising on 
the re-translation of a financial liability 
designated as a hedge of a net investment 
in foreign operations are recognised in 
the translation reserve to the extent the 
hedge is effective. To the extent that the 
hedge is ineffective, such differences are 
recognised as finance income or costs in 
the income statement. Cumulative gains 
or losses in equity arising since the date 
of transition to Adopted IFRS are taken 
to the income statement on disposal 
of the foreign operation.
Revenue recognition
Group revenue predominantly represents 
sales to external customers of 
manufactured products which fall within 
the Group’s ordinary trading activities. 
This excludes VAT and other sales taxes.
Revenue is recognised in the income 
statement to the extent that it is probable 
that the economic benefits associated 
with the transaction will flow into the 
Group and the amount can be reliably 
measured. In practice, the timing of 
the transfer of risks and rewards varies 
depending on the individual terms of the 
sales agreement. For sales of products 
and associated components, when sold 
separately, the transfer usually occurs 
on loading the goods onto the relevant 
carrier or, at an earlier point in time when 
conditions are met for recognition of 
revenue on a bill and hold basis.
Revenue is recognised on a bill and hold 
basis when a formal contract is in place, 
the product is in hand and ready for 
delivery, the customer has acknowledged 
acceptance of the bill and hold transaction 
and normal payment terms apply.
Revenue on service based contracts 
is recognised as services are 
provided. If the services under a 
single arrangement are rendered in 
different reporting periods, or under 
an arrangement that also includes the 
sale of goods, then the consideration 
is allocated on a relative fair value 
basis between the sale of goods and 
rendering of services and then allocated 
to the appropriate reporting periods in 
accordance with the transfer of risks and 
rewards and the contractual life of the 
service contract. 
Revenues and costs on a small 
number of project based contracts 
are recognised by reference to the 
stage of completion, based on the 
work performed to date and the overall 
contract profitability. The assessment 
of the stage of completion is dependent 
on the nature of the contract and is 
assessed by reference to reviews of work 
performed, achievement of contractual 
milestones and costs incurred.
Classification of assets held for 
sale and discontinued operations
Following a root and branch review of the 
cash processing systems operation (CPS), 
the Board concluded that whilst CPS 
has a good product profile and long term 
customer relationships, it did not believe 
that this is a business which should 
form part of the Group’s portfolio and 
decided to exit this market subsequently 
selling CPS on 22 May 2016. Therefore, 
in the 26 March 2016 balance sheet in 
line with the requirements of IFRS 5, 
where the carrying value of an asset 
will be recovered principally through 
a sale transaction rather than through 
continuing use, the disposal group was 
been classified as an asset held for sale 
on the balance sheet and the segment as 
a discontinued operation. This treatment 
was made with regard to the requirement 
for any disposal group to be immediately 
available for sale, the sale should be 
probable and expected to be completed 
within the next 12 months.
108  De La Rue  Annual Report 2017 Critical accounting judgements 
and key sources of estimation 
uncertainty
Management has discussed with the 
Audit Committee the development, 
selection and disclosure of the Group’s 
critical accounting policies and estimates 
and the application of these policies 
and estimates. Management is required 
to exercise significant judgement 
in the application of these policies. 
Estimates are made in many areas 
and the outcome may differ from 
that calculated. The key assumptions 
concerning the future and other key 
sources of estimation uncertainty at the 
balance sheet date that have a significant 
risk of causing a material adjustment 
to the carrying amounts of assets and 
liabilities within the next financial year 
are set out below.
Revenue recognition  
and cut-off in Currency 
Customer contracts within the Currency 
business will often include specific 
terms that impact the timing of revenue 
recognition. The timing of the transfer 
of risks and rewards varies depending 
on the individual terms of the sales 
agreement. For sales of products 
and associated components, when 
sold separately, the transfer usually 
occurs on loading the goods onto the 
relevant carrier or, at an earlier point 
in time when conditions are met for 
recognition of revenue on a bill and 
hold basis. Judgement is used in 
interpreting these terms and conditions 
in assessing when the risks and rewards 
have been transferred to the customer 
especially where they include complex 
acceptance criteria. 
Valuation of inventory in Currency
At any point in time, the Group has 
significant levels of inventory, including 
work in progress. Currency manufacturing 
is a complex process and the final 
product is required to be made to 
exacting specifications and tolerance 
levels. In valuing the work in progress at 
the balance sheet date, assessments are 
made over the level of waste contained 
within the product based on the production 
performance to date and past experience. 
In assessing the recoverability of finished 
stock assessments are made to validate 
that inventory is correctly stated at the 
lower of cost and net realisable value 
and that obsolete inventory, including 
inventory in excess of requirements, 
is provided against.
Classification of exceptional items
The Directors consider items of income 
and expenditure which are both 
material by size and/or by nature and 
non-recurring should be disclosed 
separately in the financial statements 
so as to help provide an indication 
of the Group’s underlying business 
performance. The Directors label these 
items collectively as ‘exceptional items’. 
Determining which transactions are to 
be considered exceptional in nature 
is often a subjective matter. However, 
circumstances that the Directors believe 
would give rise to exceptional items for 
separate disclosure would include: gains 
or losses on the disposal of businesses 
(other than those within the scope of 
IFRS 5), curtailments on defined benefit 
pension arrangements, restructuring 
of businesses, asset impairments and 
costs associated with the acquisition and 
integration of business combinations. 
All exceptional items are included in the 
appropriate income statement category 
to which they relate. Refer to note 4 on 
page 114 for further details.
Post-retirement benefit obligations
Pension costs within the income 
statement and the pension obligations 
as stated in the balance sheet are 
both dependent upon a number of 
assumptions chosen by management. 
These include the rate used to discount 
future liabilities, the expected longevity 
for current and future pensioners and 
estimates of future rates of inflation.
The discount rate is the interest rate that 
should be used to determine the present 
value of estimated future cash outflows 
expected to be required to settle the 
pension obligations. In determining 
the appropriate discount rate, the 
Group considers the interest rates of 
high quality corporate bonds that are 
denominated in the currency in which the 
benefits will be paid, and that have terms 
to maturity approximating to the terms of 
the related pension liability. See page 141 
for detail of the relative sensitivity of the 
value of the scheme liabilities to changes 
in the discount and inflation rates. 
Estimation of warranty provisions
The Group measures warranty provisions 
at the Directors’ best estimate of the 
amount required to settle the obligation at 
the balance sheet date, discounted where 
the time value of money is considered 
material. These estimates take account of 
available information, historical experience 
and the likelihood of different possible 
outcomes. Both the amount and the 
maturity of these liabilities could be 
different from those estimated. Refer to 
note 18 on page 134 for further details.
Presentation of disposal group 
held for sale
In the year to 26 March 2016, the Directors 
exercised judgement in assessing whether 
the criteria for recognising a disposal 
group as held for sale were met in respect 
of the CPS business at the year end, 
including whether a sale was considered 
highly probable. Further judgement 
was required in estimating fair value 
less costs to sell when determining the 
remeasurement of assets and liabilities 
within the disposal group based on the 
lower of the carrying amount and fair value 
less costs to sell. Refer to note 2 on page 
112 for further details.
Business combinations
During the year De La Rue has acquired 
of DuPont Authentication Inc (subsequently 
renamed to De La Rue Authentication 
Solutions). Determination of the balance 
sheet fair value of assets acquired is 
dependent upon the understanding of 
the circumstances at acquisition and 
estimates of the future results of the 
acquired business and management 
judgement is a factor in making these 
determinations. Refer to note 31 on page 
146 for further details.
Other accounting judgements, 
estimates and assumptions
Tax
The Group is subject to income taxes 
in numerous jurisdictions and significant 
judgement is required in determining 
the worldwide provision for those taxes. 
The level of current and deferred tax 
recognised is dependent on subjective 
judgements as to the outcome of 
decisions to be made by the tax 
authorities in the various tax jurisdictions 
around the world in which the Group 
operates. It is necessary to consider which 
deferred tax assets should be recognised 
based on an assessment of the extent to 
which they are regarded as recoverable, 
which involves assessment of the future 
trading prospects of individual statutory 
entities. The actual outcome may vary 
from that anticipated. Where the final tax 
outcomes differ from the amounts initially 
recorded, there will be impacts upon 
income tax and deferred tax provisions 
and on the income statement in the period 
in which such determination is made.
The Group has current tax provisions 
recorded within Current tax liabilities, 
in respect of uncertain tax positions. 
Provisions are recognised where there 
are specific uncertainties identified and 
it is considered probable that there will 
be a future outflow of funds to a taxing 
authority, and are measured based on 
management’s best estimate of the 
likely outcome.

1 Segmental analysis
The continuing operations of the Group have three main operating units: Currency, Identity Solutions and Product Authentication 
and Traceability. The Board, which is the Group’s Chief Operating Decision Maker, monitors the performance of the Group at this 
level and there are therefore three reportable segments. The principal financial information reviewed by the Board is revenue and 
adjusted operating profit.
The Group’s segments are:
• Currency – provides printed banknotes, banknote paper and polymer substrates and banknote security components
• Identity Solutions – involved in the provision of passport, ePassport, national ID and eID, driving licence and voter 
registration schemes
• Product Authentication and Traceability (previously Security Products) – produces security documents, including 
authentication labels, brand licensing products, government documents, cheques and postage stamps
Inter-segmental transactions are eliminated upon consolidation. 
Reclassification of results between Product Authentication & Traceability and Identity Solutions
Historically the results of one of the Group’s sites have been included in the PA&T segment as this segment represented the 
majority of its business. However, due to growth in IDS business within this site, the Chief Operating Decision Maker has started 
reviewing information including the results of this site split between IDS and PA&T. Therefore, in order to align the Group’s external 
reporting segments to the information reviewed internally the results of this site have been split in the current year between the 
IDS and PA&T segment. The 2015/16 figures have also been adjusted for comparability.
Discontinued operations – The Cash Processing Solutions operation, primarily focused on the production of large banknote 
sorters and authentication machines for central banks. The business was disposed on 22 May 2016 (see Note 2).

staff compensation costs related to the redesign of the organisation structure which was offset by a credit of £1.4m in relation 
to the manufacturing footprint review announced in December 2015 which planed to reduce our core banknote print production 
capacity from eight billion to six billion notes a year. As noted in Note 18 ‘Provisions for liabilities and charges’, in November 2016 
we announced a refinement to that plan which resulted in a change in the total estimate for the associated site relocation and 
reorganisation costs resulting in a credit to the Income Statement which has been recorded as an exceptional item consistent 
to the original presentation in the Annual Report. 
114  De La Rue  Annual Report 2017 4 Exceptional items continued
Sale of land
The gain in 2015/16 related to the sale of surplus land in Overton which generated a profit of £9.5m. Gains of £0.2m in the current 
year relate to several individually small land sales.
Warranty provisions
Surplus warranty provisions of £0.5m in 2016/17 (2015/16: £1.3m) have been credited to exceptional items consistent to where 
the cost of the original provisions was presented in the Annual Report.
Asset impairments
In 2015/16 following a review of capitalised assets, £5.2m of tangible assets within the Currency segment were written down 
representing assets linked with specific products whose future income streams are forecast to be insufficient to support the 
current carrying value.
Acquisition related 
De La Rue has incurred costs of £0.9m related to the acquisition of DuPont Authentication Inc during 2016/17. These acquisition 
related costs include £0.5m of professional advisor fees. In addition an amount of £0.4m has been recorded in exceptional items 
relating to the ‘unwind’ of the fair value adjustment to acquired inventory recognised on the opening day balance sheet as the 
related inventory was fully sold by year end. The Directors’ believe that this non-cash item is distortive to underlying profit levels 
compared to the expected cost of inventories recognised as an expense for this subsidiary going forward. 
Net cash cost of exceptional items
The net cash cost of exceptional items for continuing operations in the period was £3.3m (2015/16: £12.5m). £0.8m of the 
cash cost of exceptional items related to prior periods and primarily to payment of items associated with site relocations 
and restructuring. 
Tax credits relating to exceptional items
Tax credits relating to continuing exceptional items arising in the period were £0.6m (2015/16 £2.3m). 
5 Interest income and expense
Accounting Policies 
Interest income/expense is accrued on a time basis, by reference to the principal outstanding and at the effective interest rate 
applicable, which is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash flows through the expected life of the financial asset/
liability to the net carrying amount of that asset/liability.

6 Taxation
Accounting Policies 
The tax expense included in the income statement comprises current and deferred tax. Current tax is the expected tax payable 
on the taxable income for the year, including adjustments in respect of prior periods, using tax rates enacted or substantively 
enacted by the balance sheet date. Tax is recognised in the income statement except to the extent that it relates to items 
recognised directly in equity, in which case it is recognised in equity.
Deferred tax is provided on temporary differences arising between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial 
reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes. Deferred tax is measured using tax rates that have been 
enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date and that are expected to apply when the asset is realised or the 
liability is settled.
Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised 
to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the temporary difference can be utilised. 
Such assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary difference arises from goodwill not deductible for tax purposes, 
or result from the initial recognition (other than in a business combination) of other assets and liabilities in a transaction that 
affects neither the taxable profit nor the accounting profit.
Deferred tax is provided on temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures, except 
where the Group is able to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary 
difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer 
probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.
Deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are only offset to the extent that there is a legally enforceable right to offset 
current tax assets and current tax liabilities, they relate to taxes levied by the same taxation authority and the Group intends 
to settle its current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis or to realise an asset and settle a liability simultaneously.

7 Earnings per share
Accounting Policies
Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the profit attributable to equity shareholders by the weighted average number 
of ordinary shares outstanding during the year, excluding those held in the employee share trust which are treated as cancelled.
For diluted earnings per share, the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue is adjusted for the impact of the dilutive 
effect of share options. 
The Directors are of the opinion that the publication of the adjusted earnings per share, before exceptional items, is useful to readers 
of the accounts as it gives an indication of underlying business performance.

118  De La Rue  Annual Report 2017 9 Property, plant and equipment
Accounting Policies
Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost or valuation, less accumulated depreciation and any accumulated provision 
for impairment in value. Assets in the course of construction are included in property, plant and equipment on the basis of 
expenditure incurred at the balance sheet date.
No depreciation is provided on freehold land. Freehold and long leasehold buildings are depreciated over their estimated useful 
economic lives of 50 years. Other leasehold interests are depreciated over the lesser of the unexpired period of the lease and 
50 years.
The Group’s policy is to write off the cost or valuation of all other plant and equipment evenly over their estimated remaining 
useful life at rates which vary between 4 per cent and 50 per cent per annum. The principal annual rate of depreciation 
used is 10 per cent on plant and machinery and on fixtures and fittings. No depreciation is provided for assets in the course 
of construction.
Depreciation methods, residual values and useful lives are reviewed at least at each financial year end, taking into account 
commercial and technical obsolescence as well as normal wear and tear, provision being made where the carrying value 
exceeds the recoverable amount. 
Where borrowing costs are attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of a qualifying asset, such costs are 
capitalised as part of the specific asset.

10 Intangible assets
Accounting Policies
All intangible assets, except goodwill, are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and any impairment losses. 
Goodwill
Goodwill arising on consolidation represents the excess of the fair value of consideration transferred over the fair value of net 
assets acquired. 
After initial recognition, goodwill is not amortised and is stated at cost less any accumulated impairment losses. At the date 
of acquisition, the goodwill is allocated to cash generating units for the purpose of impairment testing and is tested annually 
for impairment or when there are indications of impairment. Any impairment loss is recognised immediately in the income 
statement and is not subsequently reversed.
Gains and losses on the disposal of a business include the carrying amount of goodwill relating to the business. 
Goodwill arising on the acquisition of subsidiaries is presented in goodwill, and goodwill arising on the acquisition of associates 
is presented in investments in associates. Internally generated goodwill is not recognised as an asset. Goodwill arising on 
acquisitions before 27 March 2004 (the date of transition to IFRS) has been retained at the previous amounts subject to being 
tested for impairment at that date.
Other intangible assets
Intangible assets purchased separately, such as software licences that do not form an integral part of related hardware, are 
capitalised at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment losses. Software intangibles are amortised on a straight 
line basis over the shorter of their useful economic life or their licence period at rates which vary between three and five years. 
Expenditure incurred in the development of products or enhancements to existing product ranges is capitalised as an intangible 
asset only when the future economic benefits expected to arise are deemed probable and the costs can be reliably measured. 
Development costs not meeting these criteria are expensed in the income statement as incurred. Capitalised development 
costs are amortised on a straight line basis over their estimated useful economic lives, which vary between five and ten years, 
once the product or enhancement is available for use. Product research costs are written off as incurred.
Distribution rights are capitalised at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment losses and are amortised over their 
useful economic lives as determined by the life of the products to which they relate.
Intangible assets purchased through a business combination are recognised separately from goodwill and are initially 
recognised at their fair value at the acquisition date (which is regarded as their cost). Subsequent to initial acquisition, intangible 
assets acquired through a business combination are reported at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment losses, 
on the same basis as intangible assets that are acquired separately.
Intellectual property is amortised over its expected life of 15 years.
Customer relationships are amortised over their expected lives of 15 to 20 years. 
Trade names are amortised over their expected lives of 15 years.

Accounting Policies
Impairment testing
The carrying amounts of the Group’s non-financial assets, other than inventories and deferred tax assets are reviewed at each 
balance sheet date to determine whether there is any indication of impairment. If any such indication exists then the asset’s 
recoverable amount is estimated. For goodwill and intangible assets that have indefinite useful lives or that are not yet ready 
for use, the recoverable amount is estimated at each reporting date.
Assets that are subject to amortisation are reviewed for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the 
carrying value may not be recoverable. In addition, goodwill is tested at least annually for impairment. Impairment tests are 
performed for all Cash Generating Units (CGUs) to which goodwill has been allocated at the balance sheet date or whenever 
there is indication of impairment. For all other intangible assets, an impairment test is performed whenever an indicator of 
impairment exists.
An impairment loss is recognised immediately in the income statement for the amount by which the asset’s carrying value 
exceeds its recoverable amount, the latter being the higher of the asset’s fair value less costs to sell and value in use and, 
in the case of goodwill, is not subsequently reversed. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted 
to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the 
risks specific to the asset for which the estimates of future cash flows have not been adjusted.
For other intangible assets, at each balance sheet date an assessment is made to determine whether there is any indication 
that an impairment loss recognised in prior periods may no longer exist or has decreased. Where such an indication exists, 
an impairment loss is reversed to the extent that the asset’s carrying value does not exceed the carrying amount that would 
have been determined, net of depreciation or amortisation, if no impairment loss had been recognised. 
Development costs with a carrying value of £1.6m have been transferred to assets held for sale to be included within the disposal 
group. See note 2 for further details.
Goodwill is allocated to the Group’s CGUs identified according to business segment.
Acquisition amounts of £9.8m during 2016/17 relate to the Group’s purchase of DuPont Authentication Inc (see note 31 for further 
details). In 2015/16 £4.0m of goodwill which related to the acquisition of CSI Inc, a provider of cash processing systems, in 2001 
was transferred to assets held for sale and was included within the disposal group. See note 2 for further details.
11 Inventories
Accounting Policies
Inventories and work in progress are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost is determined on a weighted 
average cost basis and comprises directly attributable purchase and conversion costs, including direct labour and an allocation 
of production overheads based on normal operating capacity that have been incurred in bringing those inventories to their 
present location and condition. Net realisable value is the estimated selling price less estimated costs of completion and 
selling costs.

The provision for impairment in respect of trade receivables is used to record losses unless the Group is satisfied that no

asset directly.

Balance at end of year (3.0) (3.5)
Amounts can go past due before collection in situations where the customer may have raised queries over contractual 
compliance. Such issues arise in the normal course of business and are routinely addressed to the satisfaction of the customer. 
The Group believes that the unimpaired amounts that are past due by more than 30 days are still collectible in full, based on 
historic payment behaviour and analysis of customer credit risk, including underlying customers’ credit ratings if they are available.

13 Financial risk
Financial risk management
Overview
The Group’s activities expose it to a variety of financial risks, the most significant of which are liquidity risk, market risk and 
credit risk.
The Group’s financial risk management policies are established and reviewed regularly to identify and analyse the risks faced by 
the Group, to set appropriate risk limits and controls, and to monitor risks and adherence to limits. The use of financial derivatives 
is governed by the Group’s risk management policies approved by the Board of Directors, which provide written principles on the 
use of financial derivatives consistent with the Group’s risk management strategy. The Group’s treasury department is responsible 
for the management of these financial risks faced by the Group.
Group treasury identifies, evaluates and in certain cases hedges financial risks in close cooperation with the Group’s operating 
units. Group treasury provides written principles for overall financial risk management as well as policies covering specific areas, 
such as foreign exchange risk, interest rate risk, use of derivative financial instruments and the investment of excess liquidity.
Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due. The Group’s approach 
to managing liquidity is to ensure, as far as possible, that it will always have sufficient liquidity to meet its liabilities where due, 
under both normal and stressed conditions, without incurring unacceptable losses or risking damage to the Group’s reputation.
The Group manages this risk by ensuring that it maintains sufficient levels of committed borrowing facilities and cash and cash 
equivalents. The level of headroom needed is reviewed annually as part of the Group’s planning process. 
A maturity analysis of the carrying amount of the Group’s borrowings is shown below in the reporting of financial risk section 
together with associated fair values.
Market risk
Market risk is the risk that changes in market prices, such as foreign exchange rates and interest rates, will affect the Group’s 
income or the value of its holdings of financial instruments. The Group uses a range of derivative instruments, including forward 
contracts and swaps to hedge its risk to changes in foreign exchange rates and interest rates with the objective of controlling 
market risk exposures within acceptable parameters, while optimising the return. Derivative financial instruments are only used 
for hedging purposes.
(a) Currency risk
The Group operates internationally and is exposed to foreign exchange risk arising from various currency exposures, primarily 
with respect to the US dollar and the euro. Foreign exchange risk arises from future commercial transactions, recognised assets 
and liabilities, unrecognised firm commitments and investments in foreign operations.
To manage their foreign exchange risk arising from future commercial transactions and recognised assets and liabilities, entities 
in the Group use forward contracts, transacted with Group treasury. Foreign exchange risk arises when future commercial 
transactions or recognised assets or liabilities are denominated in a currency that is not the entity’s functional currency. 
Group treasury is responsible for managing the net position in each currency via foreign exchange contracts transacted 
with financial institutions.
The Group’s risk management policy aims to hedge firm commitments in full, and between 60 per cent and 100 per cent 
of forecast exposures in each major currency for the subsequent 12 months to the extent that forecast transactions are 
highly probable.
The Group has certain investments in foreign operations, whose net assets are exposed to foreign currency translation risk. 
The Group’s policy is to manage the currency exposure arising from the net assets of the Group’s foreign operations primarily 
through borrowings denominated in the relevant foreign currencies and through foreign currency swaps.
The Group’s policy is not to hedge net investments in subsidiaries or the translation of profits or losses generated 
in overseas subsidiaries.
(b) Interest rate risk
All material financial assets and liabilities are maintained at floating rates of interest. Where the Group has forecast average levels 
of net debt above £50m on a continuing basis, the policy is to use floating to fixed interest rate swaps to fix the interest rate 
on a minimum of 50 per cent of the Group’s forecast average levels of net debt for a period of at least 12 months.
124  De La Rue  Annual Report 2017 13 Financial risk continued
Credit risk
Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its 
contractual obligations, and arises principally from the Group’s receivables from customers and investment securities.
The Group’s exposure to credit risk is influenced mainly by the individual characteristics of each customer. The demographics 
of the Group’s customer base, including the default risk of the industry and country in which customers operate, has less of 
an influence on credit risk. Geographically, there is no concentration of credit risk. Where appropriate, letters of credit are used 
to mitigate the credit risk from customers.
The Group has established a credit policy that ensures that sales of products are made to customers with an appropriate 
credit history. The Group has a policy to procure advance payments during order negotiation which further reduces credit risk. 
Derivative counterparties and cash transactions are limited to high credit quality financial institutions and the Group has policies 
that limit the amount of credit exposure to any one financial institution.
Financial instruments
Derivative financial instruments are recognised at fair value at the date a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently 
remeasured to their fair value at each balance sheet date. The gain or loss on subsequent fair value measurement is recognised 
in the income statement unless the derivative qualifies for hedge accounting when recognition of any resultant gain or loss 
depends on the nature of the item being hedged. 
Cash flow hedges 
Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments that are designated and are effective as hedges of future cash flows 
are recognised directly in equity and the ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the income statement. Amounts accumulated 
in equity are recycled to the income statement in the period in which the hedged item also affects the income statement. However, 
if the hedged item results in the recognition of a non-financial asset or liability, the amounts accumulated in equity on the hedging 
instrument are transferred from equity and included in the initial measurement of the cost of the asset or liability. Hedge accounting 
is discontinued when the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated, exercised, or no longer qualifies for hedge accounting. 
At that time, for forecast transactions, any cumulative gain or loss on the hedging instrument recognised in equity is retained in 
equity until the forecasted transaction occurs. If a hedged transaction is no longer expected to occur, the net cumulative gain or loss 
recognised in equity is transferred to the income statement. Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments that do not 
qualify for hedge accounting are recognised in the income statement as they arise.
Fair value hedges 
For an effective hedge of an exposure to changes in fair value of a recognised asset or liability or an unrecognised firm 
commitment, the hedged item is adjusted for changes in fair value attributable to the risk being hedged with the corresponding 
entry in net income. Gains or losses from remeasuring the derivative or, for non-derivatives, the foreign currency component 
of its carrying value, are recognised in net income.
Embedded derivatives
Derivatives embedded in other financial instruments or other non-financial host contracts are treated as separate derivatives 
when their risks and characteristics are not closely related to those of the host contracts and the host contracts are not carried 
at fair value. Any unrealised gains or losses on such separated derivatives are reported in the income statement within revenue 
or operating expenses in line with the host contract.

Fair value measurement basis for derivative financial instruments
Fair value is calculated based on the present value of future principal and interest cash flows, discounted at the market rate of 
interest at the reporting date. The valuation bases are classified according to the degree of estimation required in arriving at the 
fair values. Level 1 valuations are derived from unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets, level 
2 valuations use observable inputs for the assets or liabilities other than quoted prices, while level 3 valuations are not based 
on observable market data and are subject to management estimates. There has been no movement between levels during 
the current or prior periods.
Forward exchange contracts used for hedging
The fair value of forward exchange contracts has been determined using quoted forward exchange rates at the balance 
sheet date.
Interest rate swaps
Interest rate swaps are measured by reference to third party bank confirmations and discounted cash flows using the yield curves 
in effect at the balance sheet date.
Embedded derivatives
The fair value of embedded derivatives is calculated based on the present value of forecast future exposures on relevant sales 
and purchase contracts and using quoted forward foreign exchange rates at the balance sheet date.
126  De La Rue  Annual Report 2017 13 Financial risk continued
Determination of fair values of non-derivative financial assets and liabilities
Non-derivative financial assets at fair value through profit or loss are measured at fair value and changes therein, including 
any interest, are recognised in profit or loss. Directly attributable transaction costs are recognised in profit or loss as incurred. 
Non-derivative financial assets not classified as at fair value through profit or loss are assessed at each reporting date to determine 
whether there is objective evidence of impairment. 
Non-derivative financial liabilities are initially recognised at fair value less any directly attributable transaction costs. 
Subsequent to initial recognition, these liabilities are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. 
Hedge reserves
The hedge reserve balance on 25 March 2017 was £2.0m, (26 March 2016: (£2.3m)). Net movements in the hedge reserve are 
shown in the Group statement of changes in equity. 
Comprehensive loss after tax was £0.3m comprising a loss of £7.8m of fair value movements on new and continuing cash flow 
hedges, a gain of £0.2m on maturing cash flow hedges for capital expenditure and a £8.0m gain to the income statement to 
match the recognition of the related cash flows in effective cash flow hedge relationships. Deferred tax on the net gain of £0.4m 
amounted to £0.1m. £0.1m of the (£1.4m) operating expense relates to discontinued operations for 2016.

128  De La Rue  Annual Report 2017 13 Financial risk continued
Liquidity risk continued
Cash and cash equivalents, trade and other current receivables, bank loans and overdrafts, trade payables and other current 
liabilities have fair values that approximate to their carrying amounts due to their short-term nature.
As at 25 March 2017, the Group has a total of undrawn committed borrowing facilities, all maturing in more than one year, 
of £118.0m (26 March 2016: £106.0m in more than one year). The amount of loans drawn on the £250.0m facility is £132.0m 
(26 March 2016: £144.0m). Guarantees of £nil (26 March 2016: £nil) have been drawn using the facility.
On 27 April 2017, the Group extended the existing £250m revolving credit facility by two years to a maturity date of December 
2021. It is subject to the same financial covenants which require that the ratio of EBIT to net interest payable be greater than 
four times and the net debt to EBITDA ratio be less than three times. At the period end the specific covenant tests were as follows: 
EBIT/net interest payable of 16.1 times, net debt/EBITDA of 1.27 times.
Forward foreign exchange contracts
The net principal amounts of the outstanding forward foreign exchange contracts at 25 March 2017 are US dollar 16.8m, 
euro 6.0m, Swiss franc (37.7m), Japanese yen (1.1bn), Canadian dollar (0.8m), and Hong Kong dollar 10.9m.
The net principal amounts outstanding under forward contracts with maturities greater than 12 months are euro 0.6m, US dollar 5.9m 
and Hong Kong dollar 10.9m. These forward contracts are designated as cash flow hedges or fair value hedges as appropriate. 
Gains and losses recognised in the hedging reserve in equity on forward foreign exchange contracts at 25 March 2017 
will be released to the income statement at various dates between one month and 27 months from the balance sheet date. 
Short duration swap contracts
(i) Cash management swaps
The Group uses short duration currency swaps to manage the level of borrowings in foreign currencies. The fair value of cash 
management currency swaps at 25 March 2017 was £nil (2015/16: £nil). Gains and losses on cash management swaps are 
included in the consolidated income statement.
The principal amounts outstanding under cash management currency swaps at 25 March 2017 are US dollar 7.7m, euro 6.8m, 
Swiss franc (7.1m), South African rand 12.8m, Australian dollar 0.1m, Japanese yen 24.6m and Canadian dollar 0.2m, Hong Kong 
dollar 2.6m.
(ii) Balance sheet swaps
The Group uses short duration currency swaps to manage the translational exposure of monetary assets and liabilities 
denominated in foreign currencies. The fair value of balance sheet swaps as at 25 March 2017 was £0.1m (2015/16: (£0.2m)). 
Gains and losses on balance sheet swaps are included in the consolidated income statement.
The principal amounts outstanding under balance sheet swaps at 25 March 2017 are US dollar 48.9m, euro (15.1m), Swiss franc 
0.9m, South African rand 7.0m.
Embedded derivatives
Embedded derivatives relate to sales and purchase contracts denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of 
the customer/supplier, or a currency that is not deemed to be a commonly used currency of the country in which the customer/
supplier is based. The net fair value of embedded derivatives at 25 March 2017 was £9.6m (2015/16: £7.5m).
Gains and losses on fair value hedges
The gains and losses recognised in the year on the Group’s fair value hedges were £0.2m relating to balance sheet hedges 
(2015/16: (£0.1m)), (£12.5m) relating to other fair value hedges (2015/16: £2.2m), and £nil relating to cash management 
hedges (2015/16: £nil).

Fair value adjustment to credit risk on derivative contracts
The impact of credit related adjustments being made to the carrying amount of derivatives measured at fair value and used for 
hedging currency and interest rate risk has been assessed and considered to be immaterial. These derivatives are transacted with 
investment grade financial institutions. Similarly, the impact of the credit risk of the Group on the valuation of its financial liabilities 
has been assessed and considered to be immaterial.
Capital management
The Board’s policy is to maintain a strong capital base in order to maintain investor, creditor and market confidence and to sustain 
future development of the business. 
The Group finances its operations through a mixture of equity funding and debt financing, which represent the Group’s definition 
of capital for this purpose.

The long term pension deficit has been removed as a separate agreement is in place regarding the funding for this deficit which 
is paid out of cash flows from continuing operations. The Group’s debt financing is also analysed in notes 17 and 21. 
Included within the Group’s net debt are certain cash and cash equivalent balances that are not readily available for use by the 
Group. These balances are not significant, and are not readily available due to restrictions within some of the countries in which 
we operate.
Earnings per share and dividend payments are the two measures which, in the Board’s view, summarise best whether the 
Group’s objectives regarding equity management are being met. The Group’s earnings and dividends per share and relative 
rates of growth illustrate the extent to which equity attributable to shareholders has changed. Both measures are disclosed 
and discussed within the strategic report and notes 7 and 8.

Capital management continued
The Group’s objective is to maximise sustainable long term growth of the earnings per share. 
De La Rue’s dividend policy is to provide shareholders with a competitive return on their investment, while assuring sufficient 
reinvestment of profits to enable the Group to achieve its strategy. During the period, the Group invested £37m in ongoing 
research and development and capital expenditure. The proposed total dividend for the year is covered 1.8 times. The ratio 
is calculated as total adjusted earning as per note 7 over the dividend for the year.
The decision to pay dividends, and the amount of the dividends, will depend on, among other things the earnings, financial 
position, capital requirements, general business conditions, cash flows, net debt levels and share buyback plans. 
There were no changes to the Group’s approach to capital management during the year.
14 Cash and cash equivalents 
Accounting Policies
Cash and cash equivalents comprise bank balances and cash held by the Group and short term deposits with an original 
maturity of three months or less. Bank overdrafts that are repayable on demand and form part of the Group’s cash 
management are included as a component of cash and cash equivalents for the purpose of the cash flow statement.

Other deferred assets and liabilities include tax associated with provisions of £1.7m (2015/16: £2.4m) and in respect of overseas 
tax credits £5.9m (2015/16: £4.5m).
Deferred tax assets are recognised for tax losses available to carry forward to the extent that the realisation of the related tax 
benefit through future taxable profits is probable.
The Group has not recognised deferred tax assets of £2.7m (2015/16: restated to show continuing operations only £1.8m) in 
respect of losses amounting to £8.3m (2015/16: restated to show continuing operations only £5.6m) that can be carried forward 
against future taxable income. Similarly, the Group has not recognised deferred tax assets of £9.4m (2015/16: £10.0m) in respect 
of overseas tax credits that are carried forward for utilisation in future periods.
Unremitted earnings totalled £134m at 25 March 2017 (2015/16: £201m). Deferred tax liabilities have not been recognised for the 
withholding tax and other taxes that would be payable on the unremitted earnings of certain subsidiaries where the timing of the 
reversal can be controlled and it was considered unlikely that dividends would be paid from those subsidiaries.
UK capital losses of £320.6m are carried forward at 25 March 2017 (2015/16: £329.2m). No deferred tax asset has been 
recognised in respect of these losses.
UK tax rate
A reduction in the main rate of UK corporation tax from 20 per cent to 17 per cent (effective from April 2020) was substantively 
enacted on 6 September 2016. This will reduce the UK Group’s future current tax charge accordingly. The UK deferred tax assets 
and liabilities at 25 March 2017 have been calculated based on the rate of 17 per cent (26 March 2016: 18 per cent) substantively 
enacted at the balance sheet date.

Accounting Policies
Interest bearing borrowings are recognised initially at fair value less attributable transaction costs. Subsequent to initial 
recognition, interest bearing borrowings are stated at amortised cost with any difference between cost and redemption value 
being recognised in the income statement over the period of the borrowings on an effective interest basis.

As at 25 March 2017, the Group has committed borrowing facilities, all maturing in more than one year, of £250m. Up to £100m  
of the £250m facility can be utilised for either loans or guarantees.
As the draw downs on these loans are typically rolled over on terms of between one and three months subject to conditions, 
the borrowings are disclosed as a current liability. This is notwithstanding the long term nature of this facility which expires 
in December 2021.
18 Provisions for liabilities and charges
Accounting Policies
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation in respect of a past event, it is probable that an outflow of 
resources will be required to settle the obligation, and where the amount can be reliably estimated. Provisions are measured at 
the Directors’ best estimate of the amount required to settle the obligation at the balance sheet date and are discounted where 
the time value of money is considered material.

Restructuring provisions
Restructuring provisions principally relate to amounts for site relocation and reorganisation costs in the Currency and Product 
Authenticity and Traceability segments. In December 2015 we announced the results of our manufacturing footprint review to 
reduce our core banknote print production capacity from eight billion to six billion notes a year. In November 2016 we announced 
a refinement to that plan which has resulted in a change in the total estimate for the associated site relocation and reorganisation 
costs. These provisions include related amounts for staff compensation and site exit costs, which are expected to be utilised 
within one year.
Warranty provisions
Warranty provisions relate to present obligations for defective products and include known claims as well as anticipated claims 
that had not been reported at the balance sheet date. The provisions are management judgements based on information currently 
available, past history and experience of the products sold. However, it is inherent in the nature of the business that the actual 
liabilities may differ from the provisions. The precise timing of the utilisation of these provisions is uncertain but is generally 
expected to fall within one year. 
Other provisions
Other provisions comprise a number of liabilities with varying expected utilisation rates. There are no individually material 
provisions within this total in the current or prior period.

20 Share based payments 
Accounting Policies
The Group operates various equity settled and cash settled option schemes. For equity settled share options, the services 
received from employees are measured by reference to the fair value of the share options. The fair value is calculated at grant 
date and recognised in the consolidated income statement, together with a corresponding increase in shareholders’ equity, 
on a straight line basis over the vesting period, based on the numbers of shares that are actually expected to vest, taking 
into account non-market vesting conditions (including service conditions). Vesting conditions, other than non-market based 
conditions, are not taken into account when estimating the fair value.
For cash settled share options, the services received from employees are measured at the fair value of the liability for options 
outstanding and recognised in the consolidated income statement on a straight line basis over the vesting period. The fair value 
of the liability is remeasured at each reporting date and at the date of settlement with changes in fair value recognised in the 
consolidated income statement. 
At 26 March 2017, the Group has a number of share based payment plans, which are described below. These plans have been 
accounted for in accordance with the fair value recognition provisions of IFRS 2, Share Based Payments, which means that 
IFRS 2 has been applied to all grants of employee share based payments granted after 7 November 2002 that had not vested 
at 1 January 2005 and cash settled awards outstanding at 1 January 2005.
The compensation cost and related liability that have been recognised for the Group’s share based plans are set out in the 
table below:

An expected volatility rate of 30 per cent (2015/16: 30 per cent) has been used for grants in the period. This rate is based on 
historical volatility over the last three years. The expected life is the average expected period to exercise. The risk free rate of return 
is the yield on zero coupon UK government bonds of a term consistent with the assumed option life. The rate applied during the 
year was 0.19 per cent or 0.53 per cent depending on the vesting period.

Savings Related Share Option Scheme
The scheme is open to all UK employees. Options are granted at the prevailing market price at the time of the grant (with a discretionary 
discount to the market price) to employees who agree to save between £5 and the maximum savings amount offered per month over 
a period of three or five years. 
There are no performance conditions attaching to the options. After the three or five year term has expired, employees normally 
have six months in which to decide whether or not to exercise their options. A pre-vesting forfeiture rate of 5 per cent has been 
assumed based on historic experience.

US Employee Share Purchase Plan
De La Rue operates a US Employee Share Purchase Plan for US employees. Under the plan, employees have an option to 
purchase De La Rue plc shares at the end of each 12 month savings period at a price which is the lower of the market value of the 
De La Rue plc share either at the beginning or the end of the offering period, less a 15 per cent discount. In 2016/17, no shares 
(2015/16: 11,335 shares) were allotted pursuant to the plan. The Company has suspended future offerings from 1 January 2016 
due to the low number of participants and corresponding shares awarded, as it is no longer considered a cost effective incentive 
and benefit to US employees. 
Market share purchase of shares by Trustee De La Rue Employee Share Ownership Trust 
The De La Rue Employee Share Ownership Trust (Trust) is a separately administered trust established to administer shares 
granted to Executive Directors and senior employees under the various discretionary share option plans established by the 
Company. Liabilities of the Trust are guaranteed by the Company and the assets of the Trust mainly comprise shares in the 
Company. Equiom (Guernsey) Limited is the Trustee. The own shares held by the Trust are shown as a reduction in shareholders’ 
funds. The shares will be held at historical rates until such time as they are disposed of. Any profit or loss on the disposal of own 
shares is treated as a movement in reserves rather than as an income statement item. 
The Trustee held no shares at 25 March 2017.

Accounting Policies
A lease is defined as an agreement whereby the lessor conveys to the lessee the right to use a specific asset for an agreed 
period of time in return for a payment or a series of payments.
Leases are classified as finance leases whenever the terms of the lease transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of 
ownership to the lessee. All other leases are classified as operating leases.
Rentals payable under operating leases are charged to the income statement on a straight line basis over the lease term. 
Benefits received and receivable as an incentive to enter into an operating lease are also spread on a straight line basis over the 
lease term.

23 Retirement benefit obligations
Accounting Policies
The Group operates retirement benefit schemes, devised in accordance with local conditions and practices in the country 
concerned, covering the majority of employees. The assets of the Group’s schemes are generally held in separately 
administered trusts or are insured. The major schemes are defined benefit pension schemes with assets held separately 
from the Group. The cost of providing benefits under each scheme is determined using the projected unit credit actuarial 
valuation method. The major defined benefit pension scheme is based in the UK and is now largely closed to future accrual. 
The current service cost and gains and losses on settlements and curtailments are included in operating costs in the Group 
income statement. The interest income on the plan assets of funded defined benefit pension schemes and the imputed 
interest on pension scheme liabilities are disclosed as retirement benefit obligation net finance expense respectively in the 
income statement.
Return on plan assets excluding assumed interest income on the assets, changes in the retirement benefit obligation due to 
experience and changes in actuarial assumptions are included in the statement of comprehensive income in full in the period in 
which they arise.
The liability recognised in respect of defined benefit pension schemes is the present value of the defined benefit obligation less 
the fair value of the scheme assets, as determined by actuarial valuations carried out at the balance sheet date.
The Group’s contributions to defined contribution plans are charged to the income statement in the period to which the 
contributions relate.
A Trustee board has been appointed to operate the UK defined benefit scheme in accordance with its governing documents 
and pensions law. The scheme meets the legal requirement for member nominated trustees representation on the trustee board 
and a professional independent trustee has been appointed as chair of the board. The members of the trustee board undertake 
regular training to ensure they are able to fulfil their function as trustees and have appointed professional advisers to give them 
specialist expertise where required.
The Group has calculated the value of the minimum funding commitments to its schemes and determined that no additional 
liability under IFRIC 14 is required at 25 March 2017. No significant judgements were involved in making this determination.

The Diversified Growth Fund is a diversified asset portfolio which includes investments in equities, emerging market bonds, 
property, high yield credit and structured finance and smaller holdings in other asset classes. The Liability Driven Investment 
(LDI) fund consists of fixed interest bond holdings (approximately 49 per cent), index linked bond holdings (approximately 
37 per cent) and cash (approximately 14 per cent). Interest rate swaps and floating rate notes are employed to complement the 
role of the LDI fund for liability risk management. Derivatives have been valued on a mark to market basis. The LDI is designed to 
proportionally counterbalance the effect/impact of a decrease/increase in interest rates/inflation on 50% of the funded obligations. 
The Multi-Asset Credit Fund invests in a variety of debt instruments. The scheme’s assets include £18,000 of the Group’s own 
financial instruments as at March 2017 which relate to ordinary shares of the Group through index tracking investments. 
Multi Asset Credit, Diversified Growth Funds and LDI asset categories include certain assets which are not quoted in an active 
market and are stated at fair value estimates provided by the manager of the investment fund.
Other UK assets comprise cash, interest rate swaps and floating rate notes.

Future pension increases – past service 3.65 – 3.60 –
Discount rate 2.75 – 3.50 –
RPI inflation rate 3.30 – 3.10 –
The financial assumptions adopted as at 25 March 2017 reflect the duration of the scheme liabilities which has been estimated to 
be 19 years.
At 25 March 2017 mortality assumptions were based on tables issued by Club Vita, with future improvements in line with the 
CMI model, CMI_2015 (2016: CMI_2013) and a long term rate of 1.25 per cent per annum (2015/16: long term rate of 1.25% per 
annum). The resulting life expectancies within retirement are as follows:
2017 2016
Aged 65 retiring immediately (current pensioner) Male 22.7 23.0
Female 24.2 24.4
Aged 50 retiring in 17 years (future pensioner) Male 23.3 24.1
Female 25.5 26.9
The defined benefit pension schemes expose the Group to the following main risks:
Mortality risk – an increase in the life expectancy of members will increase the liabilities of the schemes. The mortality 
assumptions are reviewed regularly, and are considered appropriate.
Interest rate risk – A decrease in bond yields will increase the liabilities of the scheme. Liability driven investment strategies are 
used to hedge part of this risk.
Investment risk – The value of pension scheme assets vary with changes in interest rates, inflation expectations, credit spreads, 
exchange rates, and equity and property prices. There is a risk that asset returns are volatile and that the value of pension scheme 
assets may not move in line with changes in pension scheme liabilities. To mitigate against investment risk the pension scheme 
invests in derivatives which aim to hedge a proportion of the movements in assets and liabilities. The pension scheme invests in a 
wide range of assets to provide diversification in order to reduce the risk that a single investment or type of asset class could have 
a materially adverse impact on total scheme assets. The investment strategy and performance of investment funds are reviewed 
regularly to ensure the asset strategy of the pension schemes continues to be appropriate.
Inflation risk – The liabilities of the scheme are linked to inflation. An increase in inflation will result in an increase in liabilities. 
There are caps in place for UK scheme benefits to mitigate the risk of extreme increases in inflation. Liability driven investment 
strategies are used to hedge part of this risk.
Any increase in the retirement benefit obligation could lead to additional funding obligations in future years. 
The table below provides the sensitivity of the liability in the scheme to changes in various assumptions:
Assumption change Approximate impact on liability
0.25% decrease in discount rate Increase in liability of c£55m
0.25% increase in RPI inflation rate Increase in liability of c£28m
Increasing life expectancy by one year Increase in liability of c£55m
The liability sensitivities have been derived using projected cash flows for the Scheme valued using the membership profile as 
at 5 April 2015 and assumptions chosen for the 2017 year end. The sensitivity analysis does not allow for changes in scheme 
membership since the 2015 actuarial valuation or the impact of the Scheme or Group’s risk management activities in respect of 
interest rate and inflation risk on the valuation of the Scheme assets.
The largest defined benefit pension scheme operated by the Group is in the UK. The Group’s formal triennial funding valuation of the 
UK defined benefit pension scheme was finalised in June 2016. The underlying funding deficit as at 5 April 2015 was valued at £252m.

During 2015/16, the Group made special funding payments of £19.1m (including scheme administration fees). The Group’s formal 
triennial valuation of the UK defined benefit Scheme was finalised in June 2016. The underlying funding deficit was valued at 
£252m. The Group agreed a revised funding plan with the Trustee to eliminate the deficit over a period of 12 years from 31 March 
2016. The plan will see the existing funding payment schedule extended from 2022 to 2028. 
The cash contributions to the Scheme of £13.0m (in addition to the regular contributions outside of the revised funding plan) have 
been made in the current year and £13.5m will be made in 2018, increasing to £20.5m in 2019 and then rising by 4% per annum 
to 2022. It will be frozen at £23.0m per year between 2023 and 2028. The Group will continue to pay annual fees of £1.6m for 
managing the Scheme in addition to the cash contributions. In the year ended 25 March 2017, the Group made funding payments 
and management fees totalling £14.8m. The next triennial funding valuation is due in April 2018.
(b) Defined contribution pension plans
The Group operates a number of defined contribution plans for which the charge in the consolidated income statement for the 
year was £8.8m (2015/16: £9.4m).

26 Contingent liabilities
De La Rue has extensive international operations and is subject to various legal and regulatory regimes, including those covering 
taxation matters from which, in the ordinary course of business, contingent liabilities can arise. While the outcome of litigation 
and disputes can never be predicted with certainty, having regard to legal advice received and the insurance arrangements 
of the Company and its subsidiaries, the Directors believe that adequate provision has been made to cover these matters. 
For these and any item where a provision has not been made, the likelihood of a material additional outflow is considered remote. 
The Group also provides guarantees and performance bonds which are issued in the ordinary course of business. In the event 
that a guarantee or bond is called, provision may be required subject to the particular circumstances, including an assessment 
of its recoverability.
27 Related party transactions
During the year the Group traded on an arms length basis with the associated company Fidink S.A. (33.3 per cent owned). 
The Group’s trading activities with this company included £20.8m (2015/16: £24.2m) for the purchase of security ink and other 
consumables. At the balance sheet date there were creditor balances of £6.4m (2015/16: £3.2m) with Fidink S.A.

30 Non-controlling interest
The Group’s only subsidiary with a material non-controlling interest is De La Rue Lanka Currency and Security Print (Private) 
Limited, whose country of incorporation and operation is Sri Lanka. The accumulated non-controlling interest of the subsidiary 
at the end of the reporting period is shown on the Group balance sheet. The following table summarises key information relating 
to this subsidiary, before intra-group eliminations:

31 Business Combinations
On 12 December 2016, De La Rue entered into a Share Purchase Agreement (‘SPA’) to acquire 100% of the outstanding capital 
stock of Dupont Authentication Inc (subsequently renamed to De La Rue Authentication Solutions (‘DAS’). The acquisition 
completed on 6 January 2017, for a total consideration of $26.2m (£21.3m). This included the initial cash payment of $24.8m 
(equivalent to £20.2m) and a closing working capital adjustment of $1.4m (£1.1m) as per the terms of the SPA.
DAS is a leading global producer of photopolymer holographic films and 3D holograms and associated software. Its technology 
is used to authenticate products ranging from consumer electronics to spirits and also to secure identity documents. Its products 
are based on the highly specialised and secure Lippmann holography technology. Based in Utah, USA and with operations in 
Delaware, DAS has a well established global customer base in brand protection and identity authentication. This acquisition 
is in line with De La Rue’s five year strategic plan to transform the Group into a technology led Security product and service 
provider. It will strengthen De La Rue’s Security Features, Product Authentication & Traceability, and Identity Solutions product 
lines. DuPont Authentication’s proprietary technology will also provide a solid platform for De La Rue to create new applications 
for the Currency market. 
Goodwill of $12.1m (£9.8m) was recognised on the acquisition, being the excess of the purchase consideration over the fair value 
of net assets acquired as set out below. Through the acquisition of DAS, DLR has acquired the intellectual property, trade names 
and existing customer relationships and these intangible assets have been valued at $8.9m (£7.2m). 
Valuation techniques and key valuation assumptions and estimates
The principle intangible assets recognised were intellectual property (£4.6m) and customer relationships (£2.3m). The key 
assumptions used in valuing these were:
Intellectual property 
Valued on a ‘relief from royalty basis’. Key valuation assumptions were the appropriate third party royalty rate used to calculate the 
royalties saved from owning this intellectual property and estimations of future forecast sales levels. Management has also made 
judgements on the useful economic life of this asset and consequently the period of time over which forecasted cash flows should 
be estimated. Discount rate has been determined using the ‘internal rate of return’ for the transaction with an incremental risk 
premium added based on the perceived additional risk for this asset as compared to the acquired business as a whole.
146  De La Rue  Annual Report 2017 31 Business Combinations continued
Customer relationships 
Valued using the ‘multi-excess earnings method’. Key valuation assumptions were the future attrition rate for customers existing 
at the acquisition date and the expected growth in sales from the remaining customers in the future. Judgements have also 
been made with regards to estimated future forecast sales and cost levels. Management has also made judgements on the 
useful economic life of this asset and consequently the period of time over which forecasted cash flows should be estimated. 
Discount rate has been determined using the ‘internal rate of return’ for the transaction with an incremental risk premium added 
based on the perceived additional risk for this asset as compared to the acquired business as a whole.
Goodwill 
The goodwill recognised represents the expected synergies to be derived from the acquisition, the value of the assembled 
workforce on acquisition and assets that do not qualify for separate recognition at the acquisition date.

Consideration was fully satisfied in cash. The closing working capital adjustment of $1.4m (£1.1m) was paid post year end.
Acquisition related costs of £0.5m were recognised in the Income Statement (See Note 4 ‘exceptional items’). 
DAS contributed £2.2m of revenue and loss of £0.1m to the group’s profit (£0.3m profit based on Adjusted Operating profit which 
excludes £0.4m unwind of the fair value adjustment to acquired inventory – see note 4 for further details) since acquisition and the 
balance sheet date. If the acquisition had been completed on the first day of the financial year, revenues included in the Group’s 
results for the period would have been £10.6m and the profit included in the Group’s results would have been £1.0m (£1.7m based 
on Adjusted Operating profit).

Company statement of changes in equity 
for the period ended 25 March 2017
 Annual Report 2017  De La Rue  149
Corporate governance Accounts Strategic report Corporate governance Accounts Strategic report Basis of preparation
The financial statements of De La Rue 
plc (the Company) have been prepared 
in accordance with Financial Reporting 
Standard 102 The Financial Reporting 
Standard applicable in the UK and 
Republic of Ireland (FRS 102) as issued 
in August 2014. The amendments 
to FRS 102 issued in July 2015 and 
effective immediately have been applied. 
The presentation currency of these 
financial statements is sterling. 
Under section s408 of the Companies 
Act 2006 the company is exempt from 
the requirement to present its own profit 
and loss account. 
In the transition to FRS 102 from 
old UK GAAP, the Company 
made no measurement and 
recognition adjustments.
FRS 102 grants certain first-time adoption 
exemptions from the full requirements 
of FRS 102. The following exemption 
was taken in these financial statements: 
Separate financial instruments – carrying 
amount of the Company’s cost of 
investment in subsidiaries is its deemed 
cost at transition date, 30 March 2014.
In these financial statements, the 
company is considered to be a qualifying 
entity (for the purposes of this FRS) 
and did apply the exemptions available 
under FRS 102 in respect of the 
following disclosures: 
• Reconciliation of the number of shares 
outstanding from the beginning to end 
of the period 
• Cash Flow Statement and related notes
• Key Management 
Personnel compensation 
As the consolidated financial statements 
of the Company include the equivalent 
disclosures, the Company has also taken 
the exemptions under FRS 102 available 
in respect of the following disclosures:
• Certain disclosures required by FRS 
102.26 Share Based Payments
• The disclosures required by FRS 102.11 
Basic Financial Instruments and FRS 
102.12 Other Financial Instrument Issues 
in respect of financial instruments not 
falling within the fair value accounting 
rules of Paragraph 36(4) of Schedule 1
• The Company proposes to continue 
to adopt FRS 102 with the above 
disclosure exemptions in its next 
financial statements 
The accounting policies set out below 
have, unless otherwise stated, been 
applied consistently to all periods 
presented in these financial statements. 
On first time adoption of FRS 102, the 
Company did not retrospectively change 
its accounting under old UK GAAP for 
derecognition of financial assets and 
liabilities before the date of transition, 
hedge accounting for any hedging 
relationships that no longer existed at the 
date of transition, accounting estimates 
or discontinued operations. 
Judgements made by the directors, 
in the application of these accounting 
policies that have significant effect on the 
financial statements and estimates with 
a significant risk of material adjustment in 
the next year are discussed on page 108.
The accounts have been prepared as at 
25 March 2017, being the last Saturday in 
March. The comparatives for the 2015/16 
financial period are for the period ended 
26 March 2016.
The following accounting policies have 
been applied consistently in dealing 
with items which are considered 
material in relation to the Company 
financial statements. 
Measurement convention
The financial statements are prepared on 
the historical cost basis except that the 
following assets and liabilities are stated 
at their fair value: derivative financial 
instruments, and financial instruments 
classified at fair value through the profit 
or loss.
Foreign currencies
Amounts receivable from overseas 
subsidiaries which are denominated in 
foreign currencies are translated into 
sterling at the appropriate period end 
rates of exchange. Exchange gains and 
losses on translating foreign currency 
amounts are included within the interest 
section of the profit and loss account 
except for exchange gains and losses 
associated with hedging loans that are 
taken to reserves.
Transactions in foreign currencies are 
translated into the functional currency 
at the rates of exchange prevailing at 
the dates of the individual transactions. 
Monetary assets and liabilities 
denominated in foreign currencies are 
subsequently retranslated at the rate 
of exchange ruling at the balance sheet 
date. Such exchange differences are 
taken to the profit and loss account.
Dividends
Under FRS 102, final ordinary dividends 
payable to the shareholders of the 
Company are recognised in the period  
that they are approved by the shareholders. 
Interim ordinary dividends are recognised 
in the period that they are paid.
Investments in subsidiaries
These are separate financial statements of 
the company. Investments in subsidiaries 
are carried at deemed cost.
Employee benefits
Defined benefit plans
The pension rights of the Company 
employees are dealt with through a 
self administered scheme, the assets 
of which are held independently of the 
Group’s finances. The scheme is a 
defined benefit scheme and is closed to 
future accrual. The Group agrees deficit 
funding with the scheme Trustees and 
Pension Regulator. The Company is a 
participating employer but the Group 
has adopted a policy whereby the 
scheme funding and deficit are recorded 
in the main UK trading subsidiary of 
the Company, De La Rue International 
Limited, which pays all contributions 
to the scheme and hence these are 
not shown in the Company accounts. 
Full details of the scheme and its deficit 
(measured on an IAS 19R basis) can 
be found in note 23 to the consolidated 
financial statements.
Share-based payment transactions
Full details of the share based payments 
Schemes operated by the Group are 
found in note 20 to the consolidated 
financial statements.
Taxation
The charge for taxation is based on 
the result for the period and takes into 
account taxation deferred because of 
timing differences between the treatment 
of certain items for taxation and 
accounting purposes.
Deferred tax is recognised, without 
discounting, in respect of all timing 
differences between the treatment 
of certain items for taxation and 
accounting purposes which have arisen 
but not reversed by the balance sheet 
date, except as otherwise required by 
FRS 102.
Financial guarantee contracts
Where the Company enters into financial 
guarantee contracts to guarantee the 
indebtedness of other companies within 
the Group, the Company considers 
these to be insurance arrangements 
and accounts for them as such. 
In this respect, the Company treats 
the guarantee contract as a contingent 
liability until such time as it becomes 
probable that the Company will be 
required to make a payment under 
the guarantee.

8a Share capital
For details of share capital, see note 19 to the consolidated financial statements.
9a Share based payments
The Company operates various equity and cash settled option schemes although the majority of plans are settled by the issue of 
shares. The services received from employees are measured by reference to the fair value of the share options. The fair value is 
calculated at grant date and recognised in the profit and loss account, together with a corresponding increase in shareholders’ 
funds, on a straight line basis over the vesting period, based on an estimate of the number of shares that will eventually vest. 
Vesting conditions, other than market conditions, are not taken into account when estimating the fair value. FRS 102 has been 
applied to share settled share options granted after 7 November 2002.
Where the Company grants options over its own shares to the employees of its subsidiary undertakings these awards are 
accounted for by the Company, as an additional investment in its subsidiary. The costs are determined in accordance with 
FRS 102. Any payments made by the subsidiary undertaking in respect of these arrangements are treated as a return of 
this investment.
Share based payments recharged to subsidiaries are recorded via the inter-company loan account.
For details of share based payments, see note 20 to the consolidated financial statements and the directors’ remuneration report 
on pages 74 to 96.
10a Related party transactions
The Company has no transactions with or amounts due to or from subsidiary undertakings that are not 100 per cent owned either 
directly by the Company or by its subsidiaries.
For details of key management compensation, see note 27 to the consolidated financial statements.

152  De La Rue  Annual Report 2017 Non-IFRS measures
De La Rue plc publishes certain additional information in a non-statutory format in order to provide readers with an increased 
insight into the underlying performance of the business. The Directors are of the opinion that these measures give a better 
understanding of the underlying performance of the business. Amortisation of acquired intangible assets is a non-cash item and 
by excluding this from the adjusted operating profit metrics this is deemed to be a more meaningful metric of the contribution from 
the underlying business. The measures the Group uses along with appropriate reconciliations where applicable are shown below. 
Adjusted operating profit
Adjusted operating profit represents earnings from continuing operations adjusted to exclude exceptional items and amortisation 
of acquired intangible assets.

Adjusted basic earnings per share
Adjusted earnings per share are the earnings attributable to equity shareholders, excluding exceptional items and amortisation of 
acquired intangible assets and discontinued operations divided by the weighted average number of ordinary shares dual share in 
issue. It has been calculated by dividing the De La Rue plc’s adjusted operating profit from continuing operations for the period by 
the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue excluding share held in the employee share trust.

Corporate governance Accounts Strategic report Adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA margin
Adjusted EBITDA represents earnings from continuing operations before the deduction of interest, tax, depreciation, amortisation 
and exceptional items. The EBITDA margin percentage takes the applicable EBITDA figure and divides this by the continuing 
revenue in the period.

Return on capital employed (ROCE)
Return of capital employed is the ratio of the operating profit before exceptional items and adjusting items over capital employed, 
where capital employed equals net assets, excluding pensions, tax interest and long term liabilities. 
Cash conversion
Cash conversion is the ratio of adjusted operating cash flow divided by the adjusted operating profit.

Warning to shareholders 
– boiler room fraud
We are aware that some shareholders 
might have received unsolicited telephone 
calls or correspondence concerning 
investment matters. These are typically 
from overseas based ‘brokers’ who target 
UK shareholders, offering to sell them what 
often turn out to be worthless or high risk 
shares or investments. These operations 
are commonly known as ‘boiler rooms’. 
These ‘brokers’ can be very persistent and 
extremely persuasive. You should always 
check any firm calling you about investment 
opportunities is properly authorised by 
the FCA. You will find useful advice and 
information about protecting yourself from 
investment scams on the FCA website 
www.fca.org.uk/consumers.
