MJ Gleeson plc
Our twin track strategy – the development of low cost homes for open market sale in 
the North of England and strategic land sales in the South – delivered another excellent 
year of increased volumes, margins, profit and cash.
Gleeson Homes achieved its milestone target of 1,000 unit sales per annum and has 
set a new milestone target of 2,000 unit sales per annum within the next 5 years. 
Affordability remains very attractive and demand exceeds supply, with buyers queueing 
on site opening days. The division opened another area office, bringing the total 
number of area offices to seven plus two pilot offices, and has a pipeline of owned and 
conditionally purchased sites containing 11,588 plots, equivalent to more than 11 years 
of sales. 
Gleeson Strategic Land also had a record year and continues to benefit from strong 
demand for consented land in prime locations from both medium sized and large 
housebuilders. The division has a strong pipeline of sites, predominantly in the South 
of England, which have the opportunity of developing 21,505 plots, and anticipates 
continuing to enjoy a high level of success in promoting commercially attractive sites 
through the planning system.
The Board is confident in the Group’s short and longer term outlook.

Carlisle Park, Swinton, South Yorkshire 2 MJ Gleeson plc: Report and Accounts for the year ended 30 June 2017
Chairman’s Statement
Gleeson Homes exceeded 1,000 unit sales for the first time, 
increasing volumes by 12.1% to 1,013 units (2016: 904 units). 
Gross margins on plot sales strengthened to 33.0% as a result 
of changes to site mix, increase in selling prices and robust 
cost controls resulting in a 16.9% increase in operating profit 
to £22.8m (2016: £19.5m). Taking advantage of relatively 
low land prices in its target areas in the North of England, 
the division increased its land pipeline by 2,304 plots and  
24 sites. 
Gleeson Strategic Land increased operating profit by 17.6% 
to £12.0m (2016: £10.2m) by continuing to secure attractive 
residential planning consents and satisfying demand for 
development sites from both medium sized and large 
housebuilders.
Profit before tax increased by 17.0% to £33.0m (2016: 
£28.2m). Profit for the year attributable to equity holders  
of the parent company was £26.2m (2016: £23.0m). 
Earnings per share grew by 13.8% to 48.5p (2016: 42.6p). 
Return on capital employed increased by 220 basis points to  
25.4% (2016: 23.2%).
  
Market context
Demand for low cost homes in the North of England was 
very strong with long queues forming on launch days at new 
development sites. 
Affordability for low income families buying a Gleeson home 
remained attractive and mortgage availability continued 
to support the young first time buyers who make up a large 
proportion of Gleeson Homes buyers. 
The Government’s White Paper on housing, published in 
I am pleased to report a 
milestone year for volumes and 
another excellent year of growth 
in margins, profit and cash. 
Dermot Gleeson
Chairman
“
“
February 2017, was supportive of the approach to affordable 
housing on which Gleeson Homes’ business model is based 
and contains proposals which will, if adopted, make it easier 
for the division to secure planning permissions.
Gleeson Strategic Land continued to experience strong 
demand from both medium-sized and large housebuilders for 
consented land in high value areas in the South of England 
and attracted multiple bidders for all of its land sales. 
Land
We remain one of the few developers building low cost homes 
on brownfield sites in challenging communities and such 
sites continue to be available at relatively low cost. Gleeson 
Homes’ land pipeline grew by 2,304 plots and 24 sites to a 
record high of 141 sites (2016: 117), comprising 11,588 plots 
owned or conditionally purchased (2016: 9,284). The division 
will continue to commence building on sites as soon as a fully 
implementable planning permission is obtained.
Gleeson Strategic Land continued to source developable 
sites in the South of England. During the year it obtained 
planning consent on 6 sites; and entered agreements 
involving 6 new sites, potentially providing development 
opportunities on an additional 1,846 plots. Demand  
for prime sites with planning consent in the South of  
England from a wide range of housebuilders remains 
extremely strong. 
Employees
The Group’s strong performance during the year reflects the 
dedication and hard work of our employees.  
On behalf of the Board, I would like to congratulate and 
thank them very warmly indeed. MJ Gleeson plc: Report and Accounts for the year ended 30 June 2017 3
The average number of employees during the year increased 
to 370 (2016: 314). The actual number of employees at the 
year-end was 405 (2016: 333). 
Dividends 
Reflecting the Group’s strong financial performance and 
our confidence in the prospects for the current year and 
beyond, the Board is recommending a final dividend for  
the year of 17.5 pence per share (2016: 10.0 pence per 
share). Combined with the interim dividend, this will give  
a total dividend for the year of 24.0 pence per share  
(2016: 14.5 pence per share), an increase compared to  
the previous year of 65.5%. 
Subject to shareholder approval at the Annual General 
Meeting (“AGM”), the final dividend will be paid on  
14 December 2017 to shareholders on the register at close of 
business on 17 November 2017. The Board aims to maintain 
ordinary dividend cover between two and three times for 
the foreseeable future.
Summary
We have started the new financial year in a strong position. 
Robust customer demand and continuing site availability will 
allow Gleeson Homes to continue to grow volumes and profit. 
Following the achievement in June of the division’s interim 
target of 1,000 unit completions per annum, the Board has 
now set a new target of 2,000 unit completions per annum 
within 5 years. Meanwhile, Gleeson Strategic Land continues 
to experience strong demand for consented greenfield sites. 
Against this background, the Board is confident that the 
Group has significant scope to grow both revenue and profits 
in the current year and beyond.

Group Businesses
The Group consists of two distinct but complementary businesses: housebuilding on brownfield land in the North of England 
and strategic land trading, primarily in the South of England.
Strategic Report Governance Report Financial Statements Further Information 6 MJ Gleeson plc: Report and Accounts for the year ended 30 June 2017
A housing regeneration specialist, working in challenging communities  
to provide new homes for sale to people on low incomes in the  
North of England.
Gleeson Homes continues to build significant value for shareholders as well as delivering a unique social benefit in helping 
people on lower incomes move from housing poverty caused by the ‘rent trap’ into home ownership and wealth creation.  
Our homes are affordable enough to be sold to a couple on the current national living wage and quite often mortgage 
repayments are less than comparable council house rents.  
Key features of the Gleeson Homes business model
► COMMUNITY REGENERATION: Over the years, Gleeson Homes has played a key role in regenerating challenging 
communities. Through establishing strong relationships with local authorities, Gleeson Homes has created a ‘virtuous 
circle’ in which it acquires and redevelops legacy sites where there is an obvious need for social and economic 
regeneration and builds homes at affordable prices, thus enabling home ownership. This ‘virtuous circle’ will continue to 
underpin the business and allows for future geographic expansion. 
► SUCCESSFUL LAND PURCHASE: We partner with local 
authorities and private land owners to acquire land 
in socially and economically deprived areas which 
will benefit from community regeneration. We have a 
very carefully targeted land buying strategy that has 
clearly defined and challenging hurdle rates.
► DRIVING DOWN BUILDING COSTS: We build 
traditional two, three and four bedroom detached 
and semi-detached homes. We ensure that our good 
quality homes are built to the specification that our 
customers desire.
► LOW OVERHEADS: We ensure that overhead costs 
are kept low by having small and similarly structured 
management teams in each operating area and by 
continuously measuring their relative performance.
► ENABLING THE CUSTOMER: We offer our customers 
a range of bespoke financial packages, including a 
deposit saving scheme, to enable them to become 
homeowners.

A land promotion business that enhances the value of land by securing 
residential planning consents. The primary focus is on sites in the  
South of England likely to be attractive to a wide range of developers.
Key features of the Gleeson Strategic Land business model
► ACHIEVING MUTUALLY BENEFICIAL AGREEMENTS WITH LANDOWNERS: We enter into agreements with landowners to 
promote their land through the planning process.   
► PROMOTION THROUGH THE PLANNING PROCESS: The business’ team of land surveyors and town planners, along with 
legal and technical experts, steer the land through the planning process towards achieving a commercially attractive 
residential planning consent.
► REALISING VALUE: We strive to ensure that the best value is achieved for all stakeholders by managing the sale of the 
consented site to a developer.

Operational performance
Gleeson Homes continued to grow volume and margins and 
grew operating profits by 16.9% to £22.8m. Gleeson Homes 
increased its land pipeline by 24.8% to the equivalent of 
11.4 years sales at current build rates and active outlets 
increased by 23% to 59 sites. Whilst we have a growing 
pipeline, we always apply for planning permission at the 
earliest possible date and start building as soon as we 
receive it.
Gleeson Strategic Land increased land sales to 8 sites 
leading to operating profits growing by 17.6% to £12.0m. 
The result of the Group’s disciplined approach to investment 
was a £10.8m increase in our cash balances to £34.1m and a 
220 basis points increase in return on capital employed  
to 25.4%.
  
Gleeson Homes
Demand for Gleeson Homes remained strong with net 
reservations taken during the second half of the financial 
year increasing by 45% compared to the same prior year 
period. Mortgages remain highly affordable and available 
to our customers. Two thirds of our customers use the 
Government’s Help-to-Buy scheme; the highest priced home 
that used the scheme, at £183,445 is significantly below the 
current Help-to-Buy limit of £600,000. The average priced 
house purchased with Help-to-Buy was £122,210. 
There has been a great deal of media comment about 
the difficulties young people face purchasing a home, but 
typical Gleeson Homes buyers are blue collar workers aged 
between 18 and 33. This year we sold 60 houses to people 
aged 21 or under. The Real Living Wage (of which we are 
great supporters) has helped the working class young

to qualify for a mortgage and their ability to earn paid 
overtime enables them to save a deposit.
Our chosen segment of the market is large, mostly untapped 
and not really affected by the vagaries of politics or the 
general economy. This is because the outgoings relating to 
the purchase of one of our homes are significantly less than 
renting a council or housing association house. If a young 
blue collar couple want to reduce their outgoings they 
should buy a Gleeson home. 
We recently announced our intention to double unit sales 
from our original medium term target of 1,000 units p.a. 
to 2,000 units p.a., within 5 years and expect to either 
maintain or grow margins. To achieve this, we are:
• Growing the pipeline of owned and conditionally 
purchased sites by acquiring land in existing and new 
areas; we now have 141 sites in the pipeline.
• Investing in new office locations; we now have 7 area 
offices in the North and North Midlands and 2 new pilot 
offices in Cumbria and East Yorkshire.
• Developing our management team across all levels 
including Build Managers and Site Managers.
• Developing our employee and key sub-contractor process 
for finding and retaining key people.
• Continuing our unrelenting focus on cost reduction in 
order to offset material and employment cost pressures.
• Continuing to listen to our customers to ensure we 
provide what they need to buy a Gleeson Home.
This is why we are confident that we can double the size 
of the Gleeson Homes business within five years. We intend 
expanding in an orderly manner and will put the right 
people in the right places to deliver that expansion. MJ Gleeson plc: Report and Accounts for the year ended 30 June 2017 11

Our business model is founded on a close engagement 
with our customers and their communities, productive 
cooperation with local landowners, empowerment of our 
people and fair treatment of our supply chain to ensure that 
we are building a best in class product.
Our model is unique and is driving growth which mutually 
benefits our customers, our communities, and our 
shareholders.
I have never understood the need to sell properties 
leasehold and our only two leasehold sites are part of an 
arrangement stipulated by Burnley Council. The ground rent 
is low and we have reduced it even further to a peppercorn.
We make it our priority to make the house buying process 
fully transparent to our customers:
• We charge a fee of £200 for covering our costs for vetting 
architects’ drawings and giving permissions for extensions 
and conservatories but we do not charge for minor 
permissions.
• Householders on certain sites pay third parties to 
maintain open space areas. These charges are generally 
around £100 per year per house and are challengeable by 
residents.
• There are no other “hidden” costs or charges.
We ask our Mortgage Consultants to stay in contact with our 
customers for at least two years after purchase in order to 
help them manage their new financial environment. A two 
year fixed interest-mortgage can often be re-negotiated to 
our customer’s advantage and we certainly don’t want them 
to take out any pay-day loans.
We are accredited to and great supporters of the Living 
Wage Foundation which has helped many of our customers 
become homeowners.
We pay our suppliers and sub-contractors promptly and 
we reward good quality and service by paying our A* 
subcontractors within a week.
Gleeson Homes prides itself in being active in the 
communities in which it operates. We have sponsored  
79 junior sports teams in the last 5 years and we are 
currently sponsoring 25.
We have regular community challenge makeovers where 
local community facilities are refurbished to give local

and subcontractors, will between them have a cost of 
around £100,000. We are proud to make a real difference 
and members of our staff roll up their sleeves and help at

We have registered YourWatch® as a trade name and we  
are now able to license it to other organisations. This is  
a social media platform substitute for Neighbourhood Watch 
which works extremely well in some of the more socially 
challenging areas in which we build; it contributes to a 
reduction in crime and gives our customers a sense  
of security.
My team are dedicated to all of the above and to developing 
the financial performance of the business unit.

Strategic Land
Significant investment over the last few years has led to  
a growth in operating profit of 17.6% to £12.0m from  
8 transactions completed in the year. 
Although most major house builders have strong land banks 
there is always a healthy demand for good land from either 
major players or mid-range house builders looking for 
replacement sites.
We do not take the risk of purchasing land outright, 
preferring to take out options or similar agreements. This 
low risk and low cost approach has enabled us to invest 
heavily in the promotion of sites through the planning 
process and build up a strong portfolio.
Our highly skilled business unit based in Fleet in Hampshire 
is growing its team in order to support our recent 
investment which will result in even greater consistency in 
the flow of transactions.
Current trading & outlook
We have plenty of land on which to build homes, people to 
build them and a strong management team that can grow 
the business in a profitable and disciplined way. Demand 
and affordability of Gleeson Homes continues to be strong. 
The Gleeson Strategic Land portfolio is in good shape and 
demand remains strong from other housebuilders. The 
uplift in dividend signals our confidence in continued cash 
generative growth. We look forward to delivering our new 
target of doubling Gleeson Homes volumes to 2,000 p.a. 
within 5 years. 
We are confident the current financial year will be another 
excellent year for the Group.

1,013 homes were sold during the year, an 
increase of 12.1% on the prior year’s total 
of 904. During the year Gleeson Homes 
opened 20 new sites and had on average 50 
selling outlets open compared to 43 during 
the prior year. The outlets are located 
across the North of England

. The number of 
outlets at the end of the year increased to 
59 compared to 48 at the prior year end and 
is expected to increase to over 60 during the 
course of the current financial year
The average selling price (“ASP”) for the 
homes sold in the year was £122,700 (2016: 
£125,700). The decrease was influenced by 
a combination of factors: the completion 
of the final legacy site which had a high 
ASP , mix of site locations and the mix of 2, 
3 and 4 bed homes sold. Our aim is to keep 
ASP increases modest in order to ensure 
that our homes remain affordable to our 
customers.
Gross profit margin on units sold increased 
to 33.0% (2016: 31.1%) due to completion of 
the final low margin legacy site and a small 
increase in selling prices.
The increase in the volume of homes sold 
along with the improved gross profit  
margin on units sold has resulted in gross 
profit on units sold increasing by 15.8% to 
£41.0m (2016: £35.4m). In addition gross 
profit on land sales added a further £1.0m 
(2016: £nil) resulting in total gross profit of 
£42.1m (2016: £35.4m).
Operating profit on unit sales increased 11.8% 
to £21.8m (2016: £19.5m). Operating profit 
on land sales was £1.0m (2016: £nil). Gleeson 
Homes reported total operating profit of 
£22.8m (2016: £19.5m). Operating margin on 
units sold increased from 17.1% to 17.5%.
Gleeson Homes has a large range of 
bespoke packages to assist customers to 
become homeowners, including “Save and 
Build”, “First Rung”, “Advance to Buy”, 
“Parents Invest” and “Aspire to Own”. The 
Government’s Help to Buy Scheme remains 
popular amongst many of our customers, 
with 66% of the homes sold in the year 
utilising this scheme. 
Mortgage availability and affordability 
continued to be strong during the year as 
the bank base rate remained at historically 
low levels. As a result, the cost of buying 
a Gleeson home continued to be more 
affordable than social rent and will remain 
so even in the event of modest increases in 
borrowing costs. We are encouraged by the 
Government White Paper ‘Fixing our broken 
housing market’ published in February 2017 
and the definition of Affordable Homes, 
which should make it easier for planning 
authorities to provide consent for Gleeson 
developments.
Gleeson Homes was able to continue to 
acquire land in the North of England at 
relatively low cost. This was a busy year of 
land acquisition which saw the land pipeline 
grow by 24 sites to a total of 141 at year end; 
45 new sites were added to the pipeline, 
while 21 sites were either completed or 
we did not proceed to purchase. In terms 
of units, the pipeline grew by 2,304 units 
to stand at 11,588 units at June 2017. Of 
these units 5,320 are owned (2016: 4,357) 
and 6,268 units are conditionally purchased 
(2016: 4,927). In addition to owned and 
conditionally purchased units, there are 
a further 465 (2016: 997) units which are 
being actively considered for acquisition 
but will only proceed to purchase if they 
meet our strict returns criteria.

Operating profit  15 MJ Gleeson Group plc: Report and Accounts for the year ended 30 June 2015
Revenue from Gleeson Strategic Land grew 
by 5.3% to £29.9m (2016: £28.4m) as the 
number of successful land transactions 
increased to 8 (2016: 7). The sites sold, 
which totalled 126 acres, had the potential 
to deliver 841 plots (2016: 822 plots) for 
new housing development.
Operating profit shows the value added by 
Gleeson Strategic Land on land transactions 
through securing highly attractive 
residential planning consents and managing 
the sale to developers. Operating profit 
increased by 17.6% to £12.0m (2016: 
£10.2m) largely driven by the increase in 
transactions during the year and mix of 
sites sold. 
We continue to see strong demand from 
a wide range of developers, looking to 
acquire well located land with planning 
consent, including both large national and 
mid-sized house builders. The land market, 
particularly for sites in prime locations, 
remains strong despite the uncertainties 
caused by Brexit and the UK General 
Election in June 2017, with developers still 
continuing to need land.
 
At the year end, our Strategic Land business 
had a portfolio totalling 65 sites (2016: 68 
sites) with the potential to deliver 21,505 
plots (2016: 21,111 plots) plus a 60 bed 
care home and 67 acres of commercial 
land. The portfolio comprises 1,454 plots 
(2016: 1,454 plots) that were wholly or part 
owned by the Group; 10,020 plots (2016: 
10,540 plots) that were held under option; 
and 10,031 plots (2016: 9,009 plots) that 
were the subject of promotion agreements. 
The portfolio is at varying stages through 
the planning system and, at 30 June 2017, 
we had 11 sites consented (2,353 plots 
plus a 60 bed care home) and ready to be 
sold; 14 sites had a planning application 
submitted or are being appealed / 
judicially challenged, and 15 sites had 
applications being worked up prior to 
submission. The balance of the portfolio 
consists of sites which are being promoted 
through the development plan process. 
During the year, we secured planning 
consents for some 1,495 plots and acquired 
interests in 6 new sites plus additional  
land at an existing site. One option was 
allowed to lapse as it was no longer 
commercially viable to extend. We continue 
to invest in replenishing the portfolio with 
high quality new sites and in advancing 
existing sites in the portfolio through the 
planning process. Opportunities for new 
sites readily come forward and we use our 
expertise to select and promote those sites 
where we can deliver the maximum value 
for stakeholders. 
Our portfolio continues to have a 
geographic bias towards the South of 
England

 and sites in the portfolio are 
forecast to realise maximum value over 
a mix of short, medium and long term 
periods.

Strategic Report Governance Report Financial Statements Further Information The strategy of the Group is to build a larger and 
increasingly profitable business by increasing the number  
of housing regeneration sites in its target markets, 
increasing its housebuilding land pipeline and improving 
profitability on the sale of individual units and of land with 
residential planning permission. 
Gleeson Homes has a proven and successful business model. 
Working alongside local authorities, Gleeson Homes has 
played a key role in regenerating whole communities, 
allowing people to continue living in, or return to, their 
home neighbourhoods.
Gleeson Homes is a responsible housebuilder dealing 
ethically with all stakeholders. Refer to the Chief 
Executive’s Statement for further details.
We have been growing our regional footprint for some 
years and we continue to do so. One new regional office 
was opened during the year in Nottinghamshire, taking the 
number of regional offices to seven (including established 
offices in Sheffield, Bury, Wynyard, Chester-le-Street, 
Wakefield and St. Helens) plus two pilot offices opened 
during the year in Cumbria and East Yorkshire. Gleeson 
Homes believes its model of providing affordable homes 
for people on low incomes in areas that are in need of 
regeneration can continue to be rolled-out in other areas  
in the North and Midlands. 
Gleeson Homes has achieved its target of 1,000 unit 
completions per annum and has set a new target of  
2,000 unit completions per annum within 5 years.  
We expect to reach this target by the financial year  
ending 30 June 2022. 
Based on our estimate of the addressable customer base 
within the expanded catchment area in which we intend  
to grow, we believe that this business has the potential  
to achieve significantly more than 2,000 unit  
completions per annum. 
INCREASE HOUSEBUILDING FOOTPRINT
We will increase the number of developments throughout 
our existing and new operating areas and particularly in 
communities that are in need of regeneration. Our business 
enables people on lower incomes to become homeowners 
and regenerates local communities in areas of social 
deprivation. This strategic benefit is recognised by local 
authorities and results in more opportunities for us to 
acquire brownfield land at sensibly low prices, leading to 
increased sales volumes and profitability whilst keeping 
average selling prices (“ASPs”) low.
IMPROVE MARGINS
We will continue to control development costs and acquire 
land in line with our defined and challenging hurdle rates.
BUILD QUALITY, SUSTAINABLE HOMES
We will build good quality homes to the specification that 
our customers desire. We will ensure that our homes are 
energy efficient and have low running costs. We will use 
appropriate construction methods to build efficiently.
INCREASE LAND PIPELINE
We will continue to acquire land, at appropriate cost, in 
socially and economically deprived areas, which would 
benefit from community regeneration and we will start 
building as soon as we have an implementable planning 
approval.
PROGRESS PLANNING APPLICATIONS
We will progress planning applications on Strategic Land 
sites where we consider there to be strong prospects for 
residential housing planning permission to be achieved.
CASH GENERATION
We will maintain an appropriate capital structure, minimise 
financing costs and continue to improve returns to 
shareholders.
ROBUST HEALTH & SAFETY
We will continue to improve our safety culture and will 
maintain a high level of compliance with health and safety 
standards.
Discontinued operations
BUILDING AND ENGINEERING CONTRACTING 
The Group sold certain contracts, assets and liabilities of 
the Building Contracting Division and Engineering Division in 
2005 and 2006. The activity of this division is now limited to 
the resolution of contractual claims.

Corporate Social Responsibility Report
The generation who CAN afford to buy!
Most of our buyers are young, working class and their parents and 
grandparents have always lived in social or private rented houses.  
They have no concept of the home buying process and have no one  
to turn to for advice… except us.  
Education! Education! Education!
Over the past eight years we have enabled over 3,000 first time buyers 
achieve their dream of home ownership. 
We have partnered with money saving blogger Miss Thrifty to produce a range of videos featuring independent 
information, advice and tips which help young people gain a better understanding of the home buying process and 
how they can quickly save for a deposit. These videos are available to view on our website and YouTube.
We are also the first housebuilder to offer a LiveChat facility on our website with our preferred mortgage 
specialist. This allows customers the chance to get instant, personalised and no obligation advice on the financial 
aspect of the home buying process.
Not only have we sold them an affordable home but 
we have also worked closely with them, educating 
them on how much they can sensibly afford to 
borrow, how the mortgage process works and 
holding their hand through the legal process until 
they move into their home. 
Our involvement does not stop there. Our mortgage 
specialists stay in contact with each buyer after 
completion, checking they are coping with their 
new financial situation and offering further 
assistance once the customer’s initial mortgage 
product requires renewal.
We are now the ‘go-to’ housebuilder for first time 
buyers. No other housebuilder offers such a high 
level of support to these buyers, known as the 
generation who cannot afford to buy. Over the past 
12 months we have sold 60 homes to buyers under 
the age of 21, many of whom never thought they 
would be able to ever own a home, especially not at 
such a young age. MJ Gleeson plc: Report and Accounts for the year ended 30 June 2017 19
Strategic Report Governance Report Financial Statements Further Information
Educating the next generation
We are actively helping young people to understand the benefits of 
home ownership and a career in the housebuilding industry.
As part of our Community Matters programme we 
work with local schools near our developments, 
many of which are in challenging areas, on varied 
projects. These include our Health and Safety 
department undertaking talks on the dangers 
of trespassing on building sites, competitions 
with primary age children to design their ‘dream 
bedroom’ for re-creation in the showhomes, and, 
this year, we have expanded the programme into 
secondary schools. 
Over the past 12 months we have partnered with 
secondary schools and colleges in Nottinghamshire 
and County Durham working with pupils to highlight 
the jobs available to school leavers in new homes 
construction. We have also carried out workshops 
with 14 to 16 year olds where we discuss some 
of their misconceptions about home ownership, 
advocate the affordability of buying compared to 
a life in rented accommodation and the simple 
steps they can take now to maintain a good credit 
rating and save a small amount in a Help to Buy or 
Lifetime ISA.
Our commitment to freehold
We do not agree with selling our homes as leasehold. 
We believe home ownership should include the land 
on which it is built. 
Wherever possible we sell our homes as freehold. We only sell homes as leasehold when we do not 
own the land; this is applicable to our two developments in Burnley where the Local Authority are 
still the freeholder and a peppercorn ground rent is payable on these homes. Mike commenced his apprenticeship at our Head 
Office Land Department in November 2016 working 
closely with the Land Manager and Director on all 
aspects of purchases and the approval process. 
As well as hands-on experience Mike attends the 
Leeds College of Building one day per week to 
study for his NVQ in Construction and the Built 
Environment.
The Gleeson Apprenticeship Scheme
In September 2017 we will welcome a record 32 new apprentices to 
Gleeson Homes who will be employed in a variety of roles including site 
based bricklaying and joinery positions plus office based apprenticeships 
including new roles in our Land Department.

Local homes for local people
Our extensive range of purchase enabling schemes together with 
affordable prices and developments in established communities creates 
home ownership opportunities even for young, single buyers who never 
thought they could get on the property ladder.
“I grew up in this area so I really wanted to stay near my friends and family. From the 
moment I visited the development Gleeson were incredibly helpful, putting me in touch with 
a mortgage specialist and patiently explaining my options. Buying on my own was a little 
daunting, but it’s the best move I ever made.” Rachel McCaffrey.
“I can’t believe I went from renting a small room in my friend’s house to owning my own 
home in less than a year. I combined Gleeson’s Save & Build with the Help to Buy scheme and 
ISA and watched my new home being built as my deposit grew.”  James Hawksworth
“As a 21 year old I never thought I’d be able to afford a new home. Yet with a little help 
with my deposit from the bank of mum and dad I was able to buy on my own and now my 
mortgage is £170 less than my previous rent.” Hannah Jackson
Jobs for local people
As well as providing homes for local people we 
create jobs for local people as well. 
We give priority to labour and subcontractors who live within a two mile 
radius of each site. As well as adhering to industry wide initiatives such as the 
commitment to ensure that slavery and human trafficking is not taking place 
in our operations and supply chain, we also have some of the shortest payment 
terms in the industry and take no retention.
We work closely with our subcontractors to ensure their continued development 
and achievement of our ‘A’ Grade preferred status.

Gleeson Community Sports Foundation
The Gleeson Community Sports Foundation continues to 
grow, providing brand new kit for junior sports teams in  
our development locations.
Since the inception of the foundation five years ago we 
have sponsored 79 teams. As our developments open in 
new geographical areas we have the opportunity to not 
only reach new communities but also diversify into new 
sponsorships. This year has seen us sponsor two junior  
girls’ football teams as well as a basketball and table  
tennis team.
Below are just a selection of the 50 Junior Sports Teams Gleeson has sponsored over the last four years:
• Biddick FC • Knottingley FC • Marton Under 14s FC
• Blackburn Junior Hawks • Mags AC • Leadgate Cricket Club
• Bolden Young People’s Project • Newton Aycliffe FC • Steel City Rangers Under 11s
• Catchgate & Annfield Community Sports Club • Saltaire Cricket Club • Junior Sharks Basket Ball Team

Corporate Social Responsibility Report (continued)
22 MJ Gleeson plc: Report and Accounts for the year ended 30 June 2017
Strategic Report Governance Report Financial Statements Further Information Many of our developments are in challenging 
areas where criminality is not unusual  
and Neighbourhood Watch schemes do  
not work. 
All our buyers are automatically enrolled into YourWatch®, Gleeson’s neighbourhood watch online alert platform.  
The scheme now has over 3,000 subscribers across all our developments.
The success of YourWatch® stems from its anonymity and the ability for users to send instant alerts to us regarding 
crimes or disturbances on their development via the scheme’s website. On receipt of the alerts we make other 
residents aware of the issues and ask them to remain vigilant and information is also shared with the local police.
In 2017 we registered the YourWatch® scheme as a trademark. We can now offer the platform on license to local 
authorities and housing bodies for use on their own developments. 
YourWatch aids police with investigations  
in Grafton Park, Liverpool
When a resident at Grafton Park in Liverpool had footage 
of a bike being stolen from his driveway he sent it to 
YourWatch®. On receipt of the email and video we sent an 
alert out to all residents on the development requesting 
further information, asking them to be vigilant and lock 
away bikes to avoid further incidents. The details were also 
sent to the local police to assist in their investigations.
Over the past year we have worked closely with Denaby 
Main Academy, a primary school located close to our Kilner 
Park development in South Yorkshire. The Academy faces a 
number of barriers to learning which, in part, are due to its 
location in one of the 10% most deprived neighbourhoods in 
the country. 
High unemployment means parents do not have the means 
to financially assist with after school and social activities for 
the children. When the school approached us to sponsor a 
junior football team we were only too happy to oblige. 
The school now hopes that the football team, which is 
currently run by the caretaker, will attract parents to 
become coaches, which in turn will involve them in their 
children’s learning and lead to further groups being set up in 
this deprived community.
We also worked with the school on a ‘dream bedroom’ 
competition. We usually ask just the pupils to design a 
bedroom, however, the school asked us to invite parents to 
work with their child on the project at home as the teachers 
were keen to increase parental involvement and foster their 
engagement.

Community involvement The Winner – South Yorkshire
After carefully considering over 50 applications from groups 
and organisations across the region our judging panel 
unanimously chose Broomhall Under 3s as their winner.
The staff from this nursery, which is located in Broomhall, one 
of Sheffield’s most deprived areas, inspired the judges with 
their story of saving the nursery from closure following council 
cuts and sacrificing their own income to keep the centre 
running as a not-for-profit organisation. The centre offers 
essential free child care for local children, many of whom have 
special needs or come from disadvantaged families.
The nursery applied for a makeover of their impractical and 
child un-friendly toilet facilities. Thanks to Gleeson’s suppliers, 
subcontractors and hard-working staff we were not only able 
to provide them with a fit for purpose toilet and changing area 
but also re-decorate and lay new specialist flooring throughout 
and provide two brand new kitchen areas. Our generous staff 
also donated numerous games and toys to the centre.
The Gleeson Community Challenge
Following the success of the inaugural Community Challenge in 2015 we 
launched the competition again in 2017, inviting not-for-profit community 
groups across both South Yorkshire and Teesside to apply for makeovers of 
their facilities.
The Winners – Teesside
This year we expanded the scope of the Community 
Challenge into the Teesside region with representatives 
from Middlesbrough MBC assisting Gleeson in judging 
the entries. The response from local charities was 
unprecedented and after a clear winner could not be 
identified we took the decision to offer two makeovers 
instead of the planned one with works to be carried 
out by construction teams over the coming months.
St Mary’s Centre
Benefitting over 35,000 people per year this invaluable 
centre in the heart of Middlesbrough provides meeting 
space, function rooms and facilities to charitable, 
voluntary and community organisation. The centre, 
which relies heavily on grants and donations, provides 
a safe and secure environment for vulnerable and 
disadvantaged groups to meet. 
A lack of funds has led to many of the centre’s  
rooms requiring urgent renovation. Together with  
our construction partners we were not only able to  
re-decorate a vast area of the centre but also  
re-carpet a number of the rooms allowing them to  
be hired out for functions in turn increasing the 
centre’s income.
Hemlington Lake and Recreation Centre
Located on a vast housing estate suffering from extensive 
socio-economic issues, this popular community centre 
faced closure following recent government spending 
cuts. Thanks to the dedication of the board of trustees 
and local people the facility has remained open and 
applied for Gleeson’s makeover to transform an unused 
area of the centre into a community café to be used 
as a meeting point for local residents with any profits 
made ploughed back into the centre.
We are so pleased to have won the Gleeson Community Challenge; it’s like 
winning the lottery.
All the staff, children and parents are absolutely thrilled with the makeover. 
Our nursery rooms are now safe, secure and full of fun.

Health & Safety
Health and safety is of paramount importance to the Group 
and is considered to be a key risk.
There have been no prohibition notices issued to the 
Group during the year but one improvement notice. There 
were two reportable injuries in the year and no dangerous 
occurrences under the Reporting of Injuries, Diseases and 
Dangerous Occurrences Regulations (“RIDDOR”). In the 
previous three years the Group reported one, one, two 
injuries per year respectively under RIDDOR.
The overall Accident Incidence Rate (“AIR”) was 203 (2016: 
117) in spite of a further sizable increase in construction 
activity and is below the housebuilding industry average 
of 343 injuries per 100,000 employees, as published by the 
HBF (Home Builders Federation) and the Health & Safety 
Executive. The AIR is an industry-wide indicator of health 
and safety performance.
Environment management systems
The Group’s business units each have an environmental 
management system which controls how environmental 
performance is managed. At the operational level, the 
environmental management system is contained within our 
construction planning.
The Group’s environmental strategy is focused on:
• minimisation of environmental risk and maximisation of 
environmental opportunity; and
• ensuring knowledge and understanding is at a level 
where all employees are aware of the environmental 
responsibilities involved in their job.
Waste management: minimisation 
and recycling
Site waste management plans are put in place at the start 
of each project. Suitable recovery or disposal arrangements 
are made for all waste. Arrangements are identified for 
dealing with all waste in line with environmental agency 
recommendations.
Timber policy
The Group has a timber purchasing policy which requires 
that all timber provided or used in the manufacture of its 
products must be obtained from a certified sustainable 
source. The Group complied with this policy throughout  
the year.
Greenhouse gas reporting 
Our greenhouse gas emissions for the year ended 30 June 
2017 were calculated in accordance with the requirements 
of the Greenhouse Gas Protocol – A Corporate Accounting 
and Reporting Standard. Emissions have been calculated 
using the UK Government’s CHG Conversion Factors for 
Company Reporting: 2017 and 2016 respectively. The 
calculation incorporates the six Kyoto gasses including 
carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide and hydro 
fluorocarbons and reports them in terms of carbon dioxide

The Group believes its employees are fundamental to 
its success and has continued to invest in them through 
training and development programmes. The Group actively 
encourages all of its employees to be fully engaged in the 
identification of their own training needs in order to  
achieve their full potential and to meet the requirements  
of the business.
Individual employee performance is regularly reviewed using 
the Group’s Performance Development Review process and 
objectives and targets set for personal development.
We have continued to invest in new apprentices to support 
the Group’s growth strategy. By the end of the financial  
year there were 30 apprentices employed by the Group 
(2016: 30). In September 2017, 20 apprentices will 
be commencing their first year of the apprenticeship 
programme, 7 commencing in their second year and 5 
commencing in their third year.
We anticipate that further development of the

Group profit before tax (£m)
Revenue increased by 12.9% in the year to £160.4m  
(2016: £142.1m). The revenue of Gleeson Homes increased 
by 14.9% to £130.5m (2016: £113.6m) due to an increase  
in the number of homes sold to 1,013 (2016: 904) and  
including £6.2m from the sale of land and a legacy  
property (2016: £nil). This was partly offset by a fall in 
average selling price (“ASP”) to £122,700 (2016: £125,700) 
due to a combination of the completion of the final legacy 
site which had a high ASP , mix of site locations and the mix 
of 2, 3 and 4 bed homes sold.
Revenue for Gleeson Strategic Land increased by £1.5m to 
£29.9m, due to the increased sales activity during the year 
and mix of sites sold. 
Highlights
• Revenue increased by 12.9% to £160.4m
• Gross margin on Gleeson Homes unit sales increased to 33.0% from 31.1%

Gross profit increased by 19.1% to £56.7m (2016: £47.6m). 
The gross profit of Gleeson Homes increased by 18.9% to 
£42.1m (2016: £35.4m) due to the increase in volume, 
completion of the final low margin legacy site, a small 
increase in selling prices and the profit on land sales. The 
gross profit of Gleeson Strategic Land increased by 20.5% to 
£14.7m (2016: £12.2m) primarily due to the increase in sites 
sold during the year.
Administrative expenses include sales and marketing costs 
for Gleeson Homes, along with the administrative overheads 
for Gleeson Strategic Land and the whole Group. Overall 
administrative expenses increased by £4.7m (24.2%), 
primarily as a result of further investment for growth in 
Gleeson Homes and wages and salary cost increases. This 
included investment in a new regional office that opened 
during the year near Nottingham and full year costs for the 
new regional offices at Wakefield and St. Helens, which 
opened during the previous year. In addition, the number of 
active sales outlets increased to a total of 59 from 48 at the 
end of the prior year.
Operating profit from continuing operations was £33.0m 
(2016: £28.2m), an increase of 17.0% over the previous year. 
Growth in operating profit was driven by strong trading 
results in both Gleeson Homes and Gleeson Strategic Land

Operating profit for Gleeson Homes increased by 16.9% to 
£22.8m, including operating profit on land sales of £1.0m 
(2016: £nil).
Operating profit for Gleeson Strategic Land increased by 
17.6% to £12.0m as a result of the increase in transactions 
during the year to 8 (2016: 7).
Discontinued operations incurred a loss of £0.3m during the 
year (2016: loss £0.3m). This related to the costs of Gleeson 
Construction Services Limited, whose only activity is limited 
to resolving contractual claims from the businesses that 
were sold in 2005 and 2006. The level of claims has now 
reduced to an insignificant level.
Return on capital employed
Return on capital employed increased by 220 basis points 
to 25.4% (2016: 23.2%) reflecting stronger earnings against 
capital employed, which increased from £125.1m

Financing
Financial income of £0.3m (2016: £0.5m) consists primarily 
of the unwinding of discounts on deferred receivables on 
land sales and shared equity receivables. Interest earned 
on unwinding of discounts was lower than the prior year as 
a result of carrying fewer deferred receivables and shared 
equity receivables during the year.
 
Financial expenses of £0.2m (2016: £0.4m) consist of 
interest payable on bank loans and overdrafts, bank charges 
and interest and unwinding of discounts relating to deferred 
payments on land purchases. 
Tax 
A tax charge for continuing operations of £6.5m (2016: 
£4.9m) has been recorded reflecting the increase in taxable 
profits for the year.
Deferred tax assets relating to unused tax losses have been 
recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable 
profits will be available against which the asset can be 
utilised. The Group now has £26.7m (2016: £28.3m) of gross 
tax losses, of which £17.8m (2016: £20.1m) is recognised in 
calculating the deferred tax asset. 30 MJ Gleeson plc: Report and Accounts for the year ended 30 June 2017

Financial Review (continued)
The tax charge attributable to discontinued operations was 
£0.1m (2016: £nil). 
The deferred tax asset recorded within the consolidated 
statement of financial position totals £5.0m (2016: £4.6m). 
Profit for the year 
The profit for the year attributable to equity holders was 
£26.2m (2016: £23.0m).
Earnings per share 
Reported basic earnings per share increased by 13.8% to 
48.5 pence (2016: 42.6 pence).
 
Final dividend
Reflecting the financial strength of the Company as well 
as our confidence in the short term outlook, the Board has 
proposed a final dividend of 17.5 pence per share  
(2016: 10.0 pence per share).
Combined with the interim dividend, the dividend for the 
full year totals 24.0 pence being an increase of 65.5% on the 
prior year (2016: 14.5 pence per share). 
The Board aims to maintain ordinary dividend cover 
between two and three times for the foreseeable future.

Statement of Financial Position
During the year to 30 June 2017, shareholders’ funds 
increased by 12.1% to £171.4m (2016: £152.9m). Net assets 
per share increased to 317 pence, an increase of 12.0% year 
on year (2016: 283 pence).
In the year, non-current assets increased by 6.5% to £21.2m 
(2016: £19.9m). The main reasons for the change are the 
increase in trade receivables of £1.8m offset by a £0.9m 
reduction of share equity receivables, in addition to £0.4m 
of additional deferred tax recognised. 
Current assets increased by 21.0% to £194.5m (2016: 
£160.8m), with inventories increasing by £28.4m to 
£142.6m, trade and other receivables decreasing by  
£5.4m to £17.9m and cash balances increasing by £10.8m  
to £34.1m. 
Total liabilities increased by 60.3% to £44.4m (2016: 
£27.7m). This was mainly due to trade and other payables  
of £41.6m (2016: £26.9m) being £14.7m higher due to higher 
build activity.
Cash flow 
The Group generated £19.7m (2016: £13.9m) of cash in 
the year before the payment of dividends of £8.9m (2016: 
£6.4m), resulting in a net cash balance at 30 June 2017 of 
£34.1m (2016: £23.2m).
Operating cash flows before working capital movements, 
generated £34.1m (2016: £29.1m). Investment in working 
capital of £10.0m (2016: £11.6m) resulted in cash generated 
from operating activities of £24.1m (2016: £17.5m). 
T ax and interest payments amounted to £4.6m (2016: £3.7m).
 
Cash generated from investing activities totalled £0.2m 
(2016: £0.0m). Net cash outflows from financing activities 
totalled £8.9m (2016: £6.4m), including £8.9m  
(2016: £6.4m) on dividend payments.

Treasury risk management
The Group’s cash balances are centrally pooled and 
invested, ensuring the best available returns are achieved 
consistent with retaining sufficient liquidity for the Group’s 
operations. The Group deposits funds only with financial 
institutions which have a minimum credit rating of A.
As the Group operates wholly within the UK, there is no 
requirement for currency risk management.
Bank facilities
The Group has maintained its £20.0m committed working 
capital facility with Lloyds Bank plc which currently expires 
in March 2019. The facility includes an un-committed 
accordion option that could increase the facility size to 
£40.0m. The facility provides the Group with additional 
flexibility and was undrawn throughout the year and at the 
balance sheet date. 
Pension 
The Group contributes to a defined contribution pension 
scheme. A charge of £0.6m (2016: £0.5m) was recorded 
in the consolidated income statement for pension 
contributions. The Group has no exposure to defined benefit 
pension plans.

Operating Risk Statement
In common with other organisations, the Group faces risks that may affect its performance. The Group has established and 
operates a system of internal control and risk management procedures, in order to identify, control and monitor the risks at 
various levels within the organisation. These risks include but are not limited to the following:
Risk Description of risk Mitigation
Economic environment 
The impact of economic fragility and 
government austerity measures.
The risk appears not to have changed as 
the Government negotiates the terms of 
exit from the EU. Demand for low cost 
homes remains strong.
Any uncertainty in the wider 
economy, including government 
austerity measures and interest rate 
rises, could affect buyer confidence 
and the demand for new houses. 
This could have a negative impact 
on revenues, profits, cash generation 
and the carrying value of the  
Group’s assets.
• Sites are selected to meet the needs of the local 
community.
• Prices and incentives are regularly reviewed.
• Lead indicators of the housing market, such as 
visitors to sites and reservation rates are closely 
monitored.
• A cautious approach to debt funding is maintained.
• Gleeson Strategic Land sites are actively marketed 
to a wide and varied range of housebuilders. 
Mortgage availability 
The limited availability of mortgages for 
house buyers.
The risk has not changed during the year.
The availability of mortgage finance, 
particularly the deposit requirements 
for first time buyers, is crucial to 
customer demand. Restrictions on 
mortgages granted could reduce 
demand for new homes and strategic 
land and impact the Group’s revenues 
and profits.
• Gleeson Homes provides a range of customer 
assistance packages.
• We continually innovate to find additional ways to 
assist customers to buy a home.
• We work with key lenders to ensure products are 
appropriate and available.
Land
An inability to source sufficient land at 
an acceptable cost to meet the Group’s 
business needs. 
The risk has not changed. Land in the 
North of England remains available 
at relatively low cost. The Group has 
strengthened its land team.
Gleeson Homes needs to acquire 
consented land at sensible prices and 
in appropriate areas in the North of 
England in order to construct and sell 
homes to deliver profit.
Gleeson Strategic Land needs to 
acquire interests in land in the South 
of England so that it can promote 
it through the planning system and 
subsequently sell it in order to 
deliver profit.
• We have a clearly defined strategy and geographic 
focus.
• There is a formal appraisal process and rigorous 
adherence to margin requirements and rates of 
return.
Planning policy and regulations
The potentially damaging uncertainties 
in the planning regime may affect 
the Group’s ability to secure planning 
consents on a timely basis.
The risk has not changed during the year.
Increased complexity in some 
aspects of the planning process may 
slow down, or increase the cost of, 
the delivery of consented land for 
development or sale and so impact on 
the Group’s revenues and profits.
• We have a very high level of in-house expertise 
devoted to monitoring and complying with planning 
regulations and to achieving implementable 
planning consents.
• We consult with central government, parliament 
and local authorities, both directly and via industry 
bodies, in order to understand proposed changes to 
regulations and to highlight potential issues.
• We expect the Government’s recent White Paper 
on housing to result in a change to the definition 
of Affordable Homes that will ease our planning 
applications.
MJ Gleeson plc: Report and Accounts for the year ended 30 June 2017 33 Risk Description of risk Mitigation
People
An inability to attract, develop or retain 
good people.
The development of management 
capabilities as the Gleeson Homes 
business continues to expand.
The lack of senior level succession plans.
The risk has not changed during the year.
The loss of key staff or the failure to 
attract, develop and retain people 
with the right skills may have a 
detrimental impact on the business.
The lack of development of Gleeson 
Homes management could restrict 
profitable and sustainable growth.
The lack of leadership arising 
from the sudden loss of senior 
management.
• We have established a leadership development 
programme covering senior and mid-level 
management.
• We have established an ongoing succession planning 
process. 
• We have programmes that appropriately reward the 
achievement of performance targets.
• The Group encourages employee share ownership.
• Our apprenticeship schemes enable us to identify 
and secure the loyalty of talented individuals at an 
early age.
• We perform regular performance and development 
reviews. 
• We monitor staff turnover and benchmark 
remuneration against competitors.
Availability of raw materials and 
subcontractors 
An inability to secure materials and 
skilled labour on a timely basis at 
suitable prices.
The risk appears to be increasing with 
certain sub-contractors becoming more 
difficult to attract in some areas.
Shortages or increased cost of 
materials or skilled labour, the failure 
of key suppliers, or the inability to 
secure supplies upon appropriate 
credit terms could increase costs and 
delay construction.
• The Group has multiple suppliers for both labour 
contracts and material supplies.
• The Group seeks to partner with the supply chain 
and has systems in place to monitor and control 
their performance.
• Where appropriate, Group purchasing arrangements 
are in place to ensure the supply of materials at 
competitive prices.
• A dedicated sub-contractor procurement programme 
is employed to optimise the sourcing of scarce sub-
contractor resource.
Health & Safety 
A failure to prevent unsafe practices 
within our construction activities, 
causing injury or death.
The risk has not changed during the year.
Health & Safety breaches can 
result in injuries to employees, 
subcontractors and site visitors, 
delays in construction, additional 
cost, reputational damage, criminal 
prosecution and civil litigation.
• Our documented policies and procedures are 
regularly reviewed and modified in order to ensure 
continuous improvement.
• Dedicated Health & Safety personnel ensure 
implementation and adherence to these policies and 
procedures.
• Performance is reviewed both by local management 
and the main Board.
Latent defects 
Financial losses may arise from latent 
defects that may arise on completed 
projects during the liability period.
The risk has not changed during the year.
The Group may be exposed to 
latent defects which occur during 
the liability period on completed 
construction contracts that have not 
been transferred to the purchaser of 
the relevant construction business. 
Although subcontractors will normally 
resolve such defects, the Group will 
become liable if the subcontractor 
is no longer trading, potentially 
resulting in additional cost.
• We have experienced personnel, dedicated to 
dealing with such claims. 
• Insurance policies are in place to minimise Group 
liabilities, wherever possible.
• The provisions relating to completed contracts are 
reviewed on a regular basis.
• The company has segregated the continuing 
businesses of the Group from the Group’s legacy 
building contracting and engineering businesses.

Risk Description of risk Mitigation
Corporate liquidity
The Group needs appropriate banking 
facilities for its short term liquidity and 
long term funding needs.
The risk has not changed during the year. 
The Group may be unable to meet 
short term liabilities as a result of 
failure to manage liquidity.
Lack of liquidity may also limit the 
Group’s ability to take advantage 
of business opportunities as they 
become available and consequently 
a possible impediment to future 
growth. 
 
• The Group maintains strong financial disciplines.
• Cash generation is controlled by robust budgeting, 
forecasting and cash management disciplines.
• The Executive maintains regular contact with 
investors and lenders to ensure adequate bank 
facilities are in place with appropriate covenants 
and headroom.
Financial irregularity 
The Group could suffer loss from 
significant fraud or the misrepresentation 
of financial results.
The risk has not changed during the year.
Negative publicity could have an 
adverse effect on the Group’s 
reputation and the Group could 
experience lower confidence levels 
from customers and suppliers.
• The Group has financial and management controls 
designed to segregate duties and minimise 
opportunities for fraud. Financial reporting 
processes are the subject of rigorous and timely 
management reviews. 
Credit risk
The Group could suffer loss as a result of 
default from customers.
The risk has not changed during the year.
The Group has exposure to 
receivables on deferred payment 
terms, particularly on certain land 
sales.
• Credit risk assessments are performed on all 
customers buying land on deferred terms.
• The Group maintains security over the majority of 
land sold on deferred terms.
Information technology
Failure of information management 
systems, loss of data or cyber attack.
The risk has not changed during the year.
The Group could suffer operational 
inefficiencies as a result of a loss of 
data or system failure or as a result 
of cyber attack.
• Industry standard systems are managed by a central 
IT team with outsourced support.
• Contingency plans are in place and regularly tested.
• The majority of data is held in secure externally 
managed servers.

As a premium listed company on the London Stock 
Exchange, the Group is subject to the 2016 revision of the 
UK Corporate Governance Code. The Board believes that 
compliance with the Code assists it to provide the Group 
with effective leadership and embed good governance into 
the values, ethics and culture of the business. 
The Board continues to take governance very seriously 
and this will be an important factor as the Group grows its 
operations. Consequently, the Board is focused on ensuring 
that good governance remains a fundamental pillar in 
everything we do and across all areas of the business. This is 
essential to ensure the long term success of the Group and 
to safeguard the interests and reputation of our business.
As Chairman, I am responsible for the leadership of the 
Board and for ensuring that it fulfils its responsibilities to all 
of the Group’s stakeholders. The Board remains committed 
to ensuring that dialogue continues to be constructive 
and challenging. In doing so, the Board understands 
the importance of diversity in bringing about effective 
engagement with key stakeholders and in delivering the long 
term strategy of the business.
This report contains further details of the Group’s 
governance arrangements, together with the narrative 
reporting variously required by the 2016 revision of the 
Code, the Listing Rules and the Disclosure and  
Transparency Rules.

40 MJ Gleeson plc: Report and Accounts for the year ended 30 June 2017
I am very pleased to introduce 
this report which describes the 
Group’s approach to governance 
and explains how its application 
works for the benefit of the Group 
and its shareholders. 
“
“
Governance Statement
During the period under review, the Company, as a premium 
listed company, was subject to the April 2016 edition of the UK 
Corporate Governance Code issued by the Financial Reporting 
Council (FRC). The Code recognises that not all of its 
provisions are necessarily relevant to smaller listed companies 
and the Code states that departures from its provisions should 
not be automatically treated as breaches of the Code. The 
Directors believe that the Code is correctly applied as and 
where relevant to the Company and are satisfied that in areas 
of departure from the Code the departure is for good reason.
Further explanations of how the main principles and the 
supporting principles have been applied are set out on  
page 44.
Board composition
At the date of this report, the Board comprises six 
Directors, four of whom are Non-Executive. All directors 
served throughout the year to 30 June 2017. The Directors’ 
biographies are set out on pages 38 and 39.
The Board believes it has an appropriate balance of  
Executive and independent Non-Executive Directors given 
the size and nature of the business. In addition, the Board 
considers that it has an appropriate balance of skills, 
experience and knowledge in order for it to discharge 
its duties and responsibilities effectively. This includes a 
combination of diverse backgrounds and experiences which 
enable it to function effectively and have dialogue that is  
both constructive and challenging.
All of the Directors have access to the advice and services 
of the Company Secretary and may, in furtherance of their 
duties, take independent advice, at the Company’s expense. 
Training is arranged, as required to update and refresh their 
skills and knowledge.  MJ Gleeson plc: Report and Accounts for the year ended 30 June 2017 41

new Directors to meet their colleagues and other senior 
management, to ensure an adequate induction to the 
Group. On resignation, any concerns raised by an outgoing 
Director are circulated by the Chairman to the remaining 
members of the Board.
Board effectiveness
The roles of the Chairman, Dermot Gleeson, and the Chief 
Executive Officer, Jolyon Harrison, are clearly defined 
and they act in accordance with the main and supporting 
principles of the Code.
The Chairman is responsible for leadership of the Board 
and ensuring its effectiveness. This role includes ensuring 
that the Directors receive accurate, timely and clear 
information; facilitating the contribution of the Non-
Executive Directors; and ensuring constructive relations 
between the Executive and Non-Executive Directors.
The Chairman is in regular contact with the Chief Executive 
Officer to discuss current matters and has visited Group 
operations outside the Board meeting calendar to meet 
divisional directors and managers.
Board independence
During the year, Ross Ancell and Colin Dearlove were the 
Board’s independent Non-Executive Directors and fulfilled 
the requirement that a “smaller company”, as defined by 
the Code, should have two such directors. Colin Dearlove is 
the Senior Independent Non-Executive Director.
Ross Ancell will have completed eleven years of service and 
Colin Dearlove ten years of service on the Board at the date 
of the 2017 AGM on 7 December 2017. The Board greatly 
values both Ross Ancell’s and Colin Dearlove’s expertise 
and understanding of the Group’s operations and strategy. 
Whilst we recognise that their period of service could call 
into question their independence, the Executive Board 
remains strongly convinced that both Ross Ancell and Colin 
Dearlove are independent of character and judgement, and 
their re-appointment is in the interests of the Group and its 
shareholders.
Both Ross Ancell and Colin Dearlove have provided 
assurances to the Board of their continued independence 
and that there are no circumstances which are likely to 
affect, or could appear to affect, their judgement. We 
have talked extensively to our largest shareholders and 
they are supportive of the Board’s assessment that Ross 
Ancell and Colin Dearlove should continue to be regarded as 
independent Non-Executive Directors.
Neither Dermot Gleeson, Chairman, who has previously been 
Executive Chairman and, prior to that, has held the post of 
Chairman and Managing Director, nor Christopher Mills, who 
represents a major shareholder, Harwood Capital LLP , are 
considered to be “independent” within the definition of that 
term contained in the Code. 
Dermot Gleeson has been connected with the Company for 
a long period and the Board greatly values his experience of 
the Group. The Board remains fully satisfied that he continues 
to perform effectively as a Non-Executive Director and as 
Chairman.
Board diversity
We believe that it is in the interests of our shareholders 
that appointments to the Board are made on the basis of 
merit. We are unreservedly opposed to discrimination on the 
grounds of race, gender, sexual orientation, disability, age, 
religion or beliefs.
We also believe that there are substantial benefits to be 
had from having a Board composed of a diverse range of 
individuals, who are able to contribute to our deliberations 
from different perspectives. This is a matter to which the 
Nomination Committee gives consideration in its annual 
review of the Board’s composition.
For vacant board positions, the Nomination Committee 
agrees a role description and a detailed specification of the 
kind of person for whom it is looking. The latter sets out the 
objective criteria against which the suitability of candidates 
will be assessed, including knowledge, experience, 
measurable skills and personal qualities. Care is taken to 
ensure that the criteria effectively prevent all forms of 
unfair discrimination influencing the selection process.
Vacancies are extensively advertised. In addition, the Board 
normally appoints an executive search firm to help it to 
reach the widest possible pool of eligible candidates and to 
identify the individual best qualified for the role.  
The Board selects at least three of its directors to act as a 
panel for the purpose of overseeing the selection process; 
and it is committed to ensuring that everyone involved 
in the selection of candidates is fully aware of the UK’s 
equality legislation and the Board’s diversity policy. 
Key actions of the Board
The Board is responsible to shareholders for the success 
of the Group. Its role is to set the strategic and financial 
framework within which the Group operates, to monitor and 
review the performance of each of the divisions and  ATTENDANCE BY INDIVIDUAL DIRECTORS AT SCHEDULED BOARD MEETINGS

Strategic Report Governance Report Financial Statements Further Information
to ensure that the risks faced by the Group are effectively 
managed. To facilitate this, the Board and its committees 
are provided with relevant and timely information in 
advance of all meetings and when otherwise required. 
Due to the size and structure of the Group, all significant 
decisions are taken at Board level. There is a formal 
schedule of matters that are reserved for a decision of the 
Board or its committees; these include the approval of:
• strategy and financial policy;
• banking arrangements and any changes to them;
• interim and annual financial statements;
• risk management and internal control policy;
• major capital expenditure;
• acquisition of land;
• acquisitions and disposals;
• Board structure and composition;
• terms of reference of the Board’s sub-committees;
• entering into or amending pension arrangements;
• approval of contractual arrangements which fall outside 
authority delegated to Executive Directors;
• dividend policy; and
• pledging security over assets and providing parent 
company guarantees.
All these matters were reviewed by the Board at various 
times during the year. In addition, the Board receives updates
on governance, regulatory and legal matters at various points
in the year to assist the Board in maintaining compliance with
the legislative requirements and best practice.
Board and Committee meetings
During the year, the Board met on six occasions. Board 
packs, which include a formal agenda, are circulated 
in advance of such meetings. Attendance by individual 
Directors at scheduled Board meetings and by members  
at scheduled Committee meetings was as set out below.
The main purpose of these meetings is to permit the Board 
to receive regular reports on the performance of the Group 
and address a wide range of key issues, including health 
and safety, operational performance, risk management 
and corporate strategy. Additional Board meetings may 
be convened from time to time in response to specific 
circumstances.
During the course of the year, the Non-Executive Directors 
met without the Executive Directors present, both with and 
without the Chairman being present.
The minutes of all meetings of the Board and of each of its 
Committees are recorded by the Company Secretary. As well 
as recording the decisions taken, the minutes reflect any 
queries raised by the Directors and record any unresolved 
concerns.
Governance (continued) MJ Gleeson plc: Report and Accounts for the year ended 30 June 2017 43
Board evaluation
During the year, under the leadership of the Chairman, the 
Board undertook an evaluation of its own performance. 
This was based on completion of a detailed questionnaire 
and individual discussions between the Chairman and 
the Directors. Being a smaller listed company, it was not 
considered necessary to have this year’s Board evaluation 
externally facilitated. Similarly, the Chairman of each of  
the Audit, Remuneration and Nomination Committees 
conducted a performance review of each Board Committee. 
Colin Dearlove, as the Senior Independent Director, 
conducted an evaluation of the Chairman’s performance 
in conjunction with his Non-Executive Director colleagues 
and with input from the other Executive Directors. The 
outcome and conclusions reached from the conduct of 
these evaluations were discussed by the Board at its Board 
Meeting in September 2017. It was concluded that the 
Board, its Committees and the Chairman continued to 
perform effectively.
Risk management and internal control
The Directors acknowledge their responsibility for the 
Group’s risk management procedures and systems of internal 
controls and for reviewing their effectiveness. Further 
details on the Group’s risk management procedures and 
systems of internal controls and how the Board and Audit 
Committee review their effectiveness are included in the 
Audit Committee report on pages 52 to 56.
It should be recognised that all such systems and procedures 
are designed to manage rather than eliminate the risk of 
failure to achieve business objectives, and can only provide 
reasonable, rather than absolute, assurance against material 
misstatement or loss. Risk management and internal control 
within the Group’s operating units is delegated to the 
management responsible for the operating unit, with the 
Board retaining ultimate responsibility.
The Group operates internal controls that ensure that 
the Group’s financial statements are reconciled to the 
underlying financial ledgers. A review of the consolidated 
accounts and financial statements is completed by 
management to ensure that the financial performance and 
position of the Group are appropriately reflected.
During the year being reported, and in making this 
statement, the Company’s Board of Directors carried out a 
robust assessment of the principal risks and uncertainties 
facing the Group, including those that would threaten the 
Group’s business model, future performance, solvency  
and / or liquidity.
The Board is of the view that there is an adequate ongoing 
process for identifying, evaluating and managing the Group’s 
significant risks, which satisfies the internal control guidance 
for Directors detailed in provision C.2.1 of the Code. This 
process takes the form of a formal Risk Management Policy 
supported by financial and management controls that are 
operated Group-wide and which are subject to both internal 
review by the Chief Financial Officer and Internal Auditor 
and external review as part of the statutory audit carried 
out by the auditors.
Conflicts of interest
Following the introduction of s.175 of the Companies 
Act 2006 on 1 October 2008 and the authority given by 
shareholders at the 2008 AGM to the Directors to authorise 
conflicts of interest, the Board has procedures in place to 
deal with conflicts of interest. Under s.175, all Directors 
are under a duty to consider their positions fully at all 
times. They must advise the Chairman immediately or, 
if the Chairman is conflicted, he must advise the Senior 
Independent Director. 
If a conflict is identified, permission or refusal to authorise 
a conflict is given by the non-conflicted Directors subject 
to the appropriate quorum requirement being met without 
counting the conflicted Director. The Board may vary or 
terminate the authorisation should the facts change or 
should the Board feel it is no longer appropriate for such 
authorisation to be in place. A register of authorisations 
is maintained by the Company Secretary which includes 
date of authorisation, expiry and comments on any special 
circumstances which might include the requirement of a 
conflicted Director to absent himself from Board discussions 
or be precluded from receiving Board papers. 
Shareholder relations
There is dialogue with institutional shareholders, including 
presentations following the publication of the interim and 
year end results and, as appropriate, at other times during  
the year. Feedback from these meetings is provided to  
the Board.
The Board also welcomes the interest of private investors 
and believes that, in addition to the Annual Report and 
the Company’s website, the AGM is an ideal forum at 
which to communicate with investors and encourage their 
participation. At the AGM, the Chairman, together with 
the Chairmen of the Audit, Remuneration and Nomination 
Committees, will be available to answer any relevant 
questions.
Strategic Report Governance Report Financial Statements Further Information Governance (continued)
44 MJ Gleeson plc: Report and Accounts for the year ended 30 June 2017
For investor relations the Company uses the MJ Gleeson  
plc section of its website, which can be found at  
www.mjgleesonplc.com, to publish statutory documents  
and communications to shareholders, such as the Annual 
Report and financial statements, and the interim report, as 
its default method of publication. The website is designed to 
be a communication tool for present and potential investors 
and includes all London Stock Exchange announcements and 
press releases over the past twelve months and also links to 
the websites of the Group’s divisions. 
Compliance Statement
The Company has complied with the vast majority of the 
provisions of the April 2016 edition of the UK Corporate 
Governance Code applicable to all premium listed 
companies. The following provisions are those where the 
Company is not strictly in compliance with the Code. For 
the reasons stated the Directors believe that the Company’s 
stance is justified in this respect.
A.3.1, B.1.1
As covered under ‘Board independence’; the Chairman, 
Dermot Gleeson, has previously been Executive Chairman 
and, prior to that, held the post of Chairman and Managing 
Director. The Board has considered the guidance set out 
in the Code and believes that it is in the Company’s best 
interests that Dermot Gleeson be retained as Chairman.
B.1.1
As covered under ‘Board independence’; Ross Ancell and 
Colin Dearlove have both served on the board for more than 
nine years from the date of their first election. The Board 
is satisfied that they remain independent in character and 
judgement and there are no relationships or circumstances 
which otherwise affect, or could appear to affect, their 
independence.
Christopher Mills represents a major shareholder, Harwood 
Capital LLP and is, therefore, not considered to be 
“independent” within the definition of that term contained 
in the Code.
B.6.3
As covered under ‘Board evaluation’; the performance 
of the Chairman is appraised by both the Non-Executive 
and Executive Directors. As MJ Gleeson plc is a smaller 
listed company, it is felt that this is the most appropriate 
approach.
Nomination Committee
The Nomination Committee (“the Committee”) is a Board 
Committee consisting entirely of Non-Executive Directors. 
The members of the Committee are Dermot Gleeson 
(Chairman), Ross Ancell and Colin Dearlove.
The Committee met once during the year to 30 June 2017. 
Attendance at this meeting by the Committee members is 
shown in the table on page 42.
The principal responsibility of the Committee is to consider 
succession planning and appropriate appointments to the 
Board and to senior management, so as to maintain an 
appropriate balance of skills, knowledge and experience 
within the Company. The Committee’s formal terms of 
reference, which are reviewed annually, are available on the 
Company’s website and require it to:
• regularly review the structure, size and composition of 
the Board and to make recommendations regarding any 
adjustments that are considered to be necessary;
• identify and nominate for consideration candidates for 
any Board vacancies that may arise;
• put in place plans for succession, in particular to the 
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and
• make recommendations regarding the continued service 
(or not) of the Executive and Non-Executive Directors. 
All Board appointments and re-appointments are considered 
by the Nomination Committee. In considering any new 
appointments to the Board, the balance of skills, knowledge 
and experience on the Board are evaluated, together with 
the role to be filled and the capabilities required to do so. 
All appointments are made on merit and with appropriate 
measures to ensure that diversity is given full consideration 
and UK equality legislation complied with. 
Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee is responsible for setting the 
remuneration of the Chairman and the Executive Directors. 
The members of the Remuneration Committee are Ross 
Ancell (Chairman) and Colin Dearlove. 
The Committee met on a number of occasions during the 
year to 30 June 2017, including two scheduled meetings, to 
consider and approve the policy and remuneration of the 
Chairman and the Executive Directors. 
Further details of the remuneration policy and the package 
for each Director serving during the year to 30 June 2017 
are set out in the Remuneration Report on pages 58 to 74.
Strategic Report Governance Report Financial Statements Further Information MJ Gleeson plc: Report and Accounts for the year ended 30 June 2017 45
Disclosure Committee
The Disclosure Committee was set up by the Board in 
September 2016 to comply with the requirements of the 
Market Abuse Regulation (MAR), which came into effect on  
3 July 2016. 
The Committee comprises of the Executive Directors. Other 
Directors, executives and external advisors may attend by 
invitation as appropriate. The Committee’s formal terms of 
reference, which are reviewed annually, are available on the 
Company’s website and require it to:
• draw up and maintain procedures, systems and controls 
for the identification, treatment and disclosure of 
inside information and to comply with other disclosure 
obligations falling on the Company under the Listing Rules 
and MAR;
• implement, monitor compliance and review the adequacy 
of the Company’s disclosure policy, including where 
appropriate arranging for the dissemination of guidelines 
and training; and
• ensure that all regulatory announcements, shareholder 
circulars, prospectuses and other documents issued by 
the Company under any legal or regulatory requirement 
are scrutinised in order to ensure that they comply with 
applicable requirements.
The Committee met on one occasion during the year to 
30 June 2017, to review the performance of the Company 
against its disclosure policy and compliance with MAR. 
Audit Committee
The Audit Committee is a Board Committee consisting 
entirely of Non-Executive Directors. The members of the 
Committee are Colin Dearlove (Chairman) and Ross Ancell. 
The Chairman invites the Chief Executive Officer and 
the Chief Financial Officer and other senior management 
to attend, along with the Group’s internal and external 
auditors, when required. 
The Committee met on a number of occasions during the 
year to 30 June 2017, including four scheduled meetings, 
with both members being in attendance for all meetings. 
The Committee regularly meets with the auditor and the 
internal auditor without the presence of the Company’s 
management.
A full report from the Audit Committee is presented 
separately on pages 52 to 56 and forms part of the 
Governance Report.
Viability Statement 
In accordance with provision C2.2 of the 2016 revision of the 
UK Corporate Governance Code, the Directors have assessed 
the longer term viability of the Company and the Group over 
a longer period than the 12 months required by the ‘going 
concern’ principle.
The Directors conducted their assessment over a period 
of three years to 30 June 2020, which is in line with the 
Group’s financial budget review period and the operational 
period of a number of the Group’s housing developments. 
This has enabled a meaningful assessment of viability to 
be undertaken, utilising detailed financial budgets which 
incorporate individual site cash flow forecasts.
In making its assessment, the Directors have considered the 
business risks facing the Group and how the Group mitigates 
such risks, which are summarised on pages 33 to 35 of the 
Strategic Report. 
The majority of risks in Gleeson Homes are operational in 
nature, and hence these risks are already taken into account 
in the individual site cash flow forecasts. The Directors 
have considered sensitivities to the individual site cash flow 
forecasts prepared based on realistically possible changes 
to principal assumptions such as forecast selling prices, 
build costs, the number of completions, and gross margins. 
Additionally the Directors have considered further measures 
which may need to be taken to mitigate the impact of 
macroeconomic and industry wide risks, including the ability 
of the Group to curtail investment expenditure in new land 
purchases and defer new site starts. 
For Gleeson Strategic Land, the Directors have considered 
the impact of delays to the completion of land sales and 
reduction in land selling prices. The business model is 
such that it has the flexibility to reduce expenditure on 
progressing new and existing sites and to continue to 
realise cash from consented land albeit at lower levels of 
profitability.
Furthermore, a core principle of the Group is to maintain a 
cautious approach to debt funding, reflecting the inherent 
cyclical nature of the UK property market. 
Based on the results of this assessment, the Directors have 
a reasonable expectation that the Company and the Group 
will be able to continue in operation and meet its liabilities 
as they fall due over the three year period of  
their assessment.

Strategic report
In accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 
2006, we present a review of the business during the year 
to 30 June 2017 and of the position of the Group at the 
end of the financial year together with a description of the 
principal risks and uncertainties faced by the Group in the 
Strategic Report on pages 4 to 35.
Governance statement
The Disclosure Guidance and Transparency Rules require 
certain information to be included in a governance 
statement in the Directors’ Report. Information that fulfils 
the requirements of the governance statement can be found 
in the Governance Report on pages 37 to 45.
Results and dividends 
The results are set out in the consolidated income 
statement on page 84. The subsidiary companies affecting 
the profit or net assets of the Group in the year are listed in 
note 15 to the financial statements.
An interim dividend of 6.5 pence per share was paid to 
shareholders on 7 April 2017 (2016: 4.5 pence). The Board 
proposes to pay, subject to shareholder approval at the 2017 
AGM, a final dividend of 17.5 pence per share (2016: 10.0 
pence) in respect of the 2017 financial year on 14 December 
2017 to shareholders on the register at the close of business 
on 17 November 2017. On this basis, the total dividend for 
the year will be 24.0 pence per share (2016: 14.5 pence).
Business review
The review of the development and performance of the 
business of the Group during the year and the future outlook 
of the Group is set out in the Chairman’s Statement on 
pages 2 and 3, the Chief Executive’s Statement on pages 
10 to 12 and the Business Performance reviews on pages 
14 and 15. Details of the principal risks and uncertainties 
faced by the Group are set out in the Strategic Report on 
pages 33 to 35. The key performance indicators are set out 
in the Strategic Report on pages 8 and 9. The Group’s policy 
in respect of financial instruments is set out within the 
Accounting Policies on pages 90 to 95 and details of credit 
risk, capital risk management, liquidity risk and interest 
rate risk are given in note 18 to the financial statements.
Going concern 
The Group’s business activities, together with the factors 
likely to affect its future development, performance 
and position, are set out in the Strategic Report (Chief 
Executive’s Statement and Business Performance reviews) 
on pages 10 to 15.  The financial position of the Group, its 
cash flows, liquidity position and borrowing facilities are 
described in the Strategic Report (Financial Review) on 
pages 28 to 31.
 
The Group meets its day-to-day working capital 
requirements through its cash resources and £20m revolving 
credit facility, which was entered into in March 2016 with an 
expiry date of March 2019. At 30 June 2017, the Group had 
a cash balance of £34.1m (2016: £23.2m) and the revolving 
credit facility was undrawn (2016: undrawn).
As part of their regular going concern review the Directors 
specifically address all the risk areas that they consider 
material to the assessment of going concern. The report 
arising from these discussions is made available to the 
auditors and the conclusion is that the Directors have 
a reasonable expectation that the Group has adequate 
resources to continue in operational existence for at least 
twelve months from the date of the financial statements 
and thus they continue to adopt the going concern basis of 
accounting in preparing the financial statements.
Political donations
The Company made no political donations in the year or in 
the previous year.

Directors’ indemnity
Directors risk personal liability under civil and criminal law 
for many aspects of the Company’s main business decisions. 
As a consequence the Directors could face a range of 
penalties including fines and/or imprisonment. In keeping 
with normal market practice, the Company believes that 
it is prudent and in the best interests of the Company to 
protect the individuals concerned from the consequences  
of innocent error or omission.
As a result, the Company operates a Directors and Officers’ 
liability insurance policy in order to indemnify Directors and 
other senior officers of the Company and its subsidiaries, 
as recommended by the Corporate Governance Code. This 
insurance policy does not provide cover where the Director 
or officer has acted fraudulently or dishonestly. 
In addition, subject to the provisions of and to the extent 
permitted by relevant statutes, under the Articles, the 
Directors and other officers throughout the year, and at 
the date of approval of these financial statements, were 
indemnified out of the assets of the Company against 
liabilities incurred by them in the course of carrying out 
their duties or the exercise of their powers.

this Directors’ Report confirm that, so far as they are each 
aware, there is no relevant audit information of which the 
Company’s auditor is unaware, and the Directors have taken 
all the steps that they ought to have taken as Directors to 
make themselves aware of any relevant audit information 
and to establish that the Company’s auditor is aware of that

Winding up
Under the Articles, if the Company is in liquidation, the 
liquidator may, with the sanction of a special resolution of 
the Company and any other authority required by law:
• divide among the shareholders in specie the whole or any 
part of the assets of the Company and, for that purpose, 
value any assets and determine how the division shall 
be carried out as between the shareholders or different 
classes of shareholders; or
• vest the whole or any part of the assets in trustees 
upon such trusts for the benefit of shareholders as the 
liquidator with the like sanction shall think fit.
Variation of rights
The Articles specify that the special rights attached to any 
class of shares may, either with the consent in writing of

or with the sanction of a special resolution passed at a 
separate meeting of such holders (but not otherwise), be 
modified or abrogated.
Transfer of shares
Under and subject to the restrictions in the Articles, any 
shareholder may transfer all or any of their shares in 
certificated form by transfer in writing in any usual form or 
in any other form which the Board may approve. The Board 
may, save in certain circumstances, refuse to register any 
transfer of a certificated share not fully paid up. The Board 
may also refuse to register any transfer of certificated 
shares unless it is:
• in respect of only one class of shares;
• in favour of no more than four transferees;
• duly stamped or exempt from stamp duty;
• delivered to the office or at such other place as the Board 
may decide for registration; and

may reasonably require to show the right of the intending 
transferor to transfer the shares.
Repurchase of shares
Subject to the provisions of the Companies Acts and to any 
rights conferred on the holders of any class of shares, the 
Company may purchase all or any of its shares of any class,

ordinary resolution of the Company, be less than three or 
more than fifteen in number.  Directors may be appointed 
by the Company by ordinary resolution or by the Board. 
A Director appointed by the Board shall retire from office 
at the next AGM of the Company but shall then be eligible 
for re-appointment. The Board may appoint one or more 
Directors to hold any office or employment under the 
Company for such period (subject to the Companies Acts) 
and on such terms as it may decide and may revoke or 
terminate any such appointment. At each AGM any Director 
who has been appointed by the Board since the previous 
AGM and any Director selected to retire by rotation shall 
retire from office. At each AGM, one-third of the Directors 
are required to retire by rotation or, if the number is

office. In addition, there shall also be required to retire by 
rotation any Director who at any AGM of the Company shall 
have been a Director at each of the preceding two AGMs 
of the Company, provided that they were not appointed 
or re-appointed at either such AGM and they have not 
otherwise ceased to be a Director and been re-appointed 
by general meeting of the Company at or since either such 
AGM. Notwithstanding this, the Board has determined 
that all Directors will be subject to annual re-election by 
shareholders at each AGM.

notice has been given in accordance with the Companies 
Acts, remove any Director before their period of office has 
expired notwithstanding anything in the Articles or in any 
agreement between that Director and the Company.  
A Director may also be removed from office by the service 
of a notice to that effect signed by or on behalf of all the 
other Directors, being not less than three in number.
Powers of the Directors
The business of the Company shall be managed by the 
Board which may exercise all the powers of the Company,

borrow money and to mortgage or charge all or any part of

and to issue debentures and other securities, subject to the 
provisions of the Articles.

Statement from the Chairman  
of the Audit Committee
I am pleased to introduce the Audit Committee report for 
the financial year ended 30 June 2017. The Committee 
continues to have a very busy agenda and plays a key role in 
supporting the Board to fulfil its governance responsibilities. 
The Committee undertook all of its regular activities this 
year including receiving and reviewing the Annual Report and 
Regulatory Announcements made by the Company, together 
with examining going concern and viability, internal and 
external audit findings and performance, internal controls 
and their effectiveness, the impact of new accounting 
standards on the Group and other important matters.
In addition, the Committee completed a number of other 
significant actions during the year. This included running 
a successful external audit tender process, reviewing 
how gross margin is being applied on a site-by-site basis, 
assessing Group credit risk management procedures, 
inventory recovery, legacy matters, and reviewing and 
approving a new Group accounting policies manual. 
The Committee is the busiest of all the Board Committees 
and proactively engages with management on a wide range 
of matters. This will continue as the size of the Group 
continues to grow. The Committee serves to ensure that 
the relevant codes and regulations are adhered to and that 
the business operates in a well-controlled and financially 
responsible manner.

Audit Committee membership
The Audit Committee (“the Committee”) is a Board 
Committee consisting entirely of Non-Executive Directors. 
The members of the Committee are Colin Dearlove 
(Chairman) and Ross Ancell. 
Colin Dearlove, as Chairman of the Committee, has relevant

Holdings Limited. The biographies and qualifications of 
the members are shown on pages 38 and 39. The Board 
has determined that the Audit Committee has competence 
relevant to the sector in which the Company operates.
The Chairman routinely invites the Chief Executive 
Officer and the Chief Financial Officer and other senior

• review the Company’s procedures for detecting fraud, 
preventing bribery and ensuring there are appropriate 
whistleblowing procedures in place; 
• oversee the relationship with the external auditor 
including their appointment, independence and objectivity 
and the effectiveness of the external audit process;
• develop the policy on the supply of external audit 
services by the external auditor, taking into account 
relevant ethical guidance.
The Committee’s terms of reference can be found at  
www.mjgleesonplc.com
Following a review by the Committee at its meeting in 
June 2017 it was determined that the terms of reference 
of the Committee remain appropriate and reflect the 
responsibilities of the Committee under the 2016 revision  
of the UK Governance Code (“the Code”) and related 
regulations.
Activities during the year
The Committee met on five occasions during the year to 
30 June 2017, of which four were scheduled meetings, 
with both members being in attendance for all meetings. 
Scheduled Committee meetings generally take place prior 
to Board meetings and the Committee Chairman provides 
the Board with a report on the activity of the Committee 
and the matters of particular relevance to the Board in the 
conduct of their work. The key activities undertaken by the 
Committee during the year were:
FINANCIAL REPORTING
The Committee reviewed the integrity of the Annual Report 
and formal announcements relating to the Group’s financial 
performance. Since the date of the last annual report, the 
Committee has reviewed:
• the draft interim results for the 6 months to December 
2016 which were reviewed by the Committee at its 
meeting in February 2017; and
• the draft 2017 Annual Report and preliminary 
announcement which were reviewed by the Committee at 
its meeting in September 2017.
At the request of the Board, the Committee considered 
whether the 2017 Annual Report taken as a whole is fair, 
balanced and understandable and whether it provides 
the necessary information for shareholders to assess the 
Company’s performance, business model and strategy. 
In doing so, the Committee received comments from 
management and the external auditors at its meeting in 
September 2017. It also reviewed the annual compliance 
procedures and management returns that support the 
Group’s financial reporting governance framework and risk 
management process for the financial year ended  
30 June 2017. 
The Committee was satisfied that, taken as a whole, the 
2017 Annual Report is fair, balanced and understandable and 
provides sufficient information for shareholders to assess the 
Company’s performance, business model and strategy. The 
Committee recommended as such to the Board.
EXTERNAL AUDIT TENDER 
In October 2016, the Committee in conjunction with the 
Chief Financial Officer, undertook a competitive audit tender 
process. A number of shortlisted firms presented to the 
Committee and the Chief Financial Officer. The Committee 
conducted a rigorous assessment of each firm’s proposal and 
after due consideration a recommendation was made to the 
Board for PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP to be appointed as 
external auditors to the Company, subject to approval by 
shareholders at the AGM on 8 December 2016. As detailed 
under ‘External audit’, this was subsequently approved by 
shareholders.
GOING CONCERN AND VIABILITY REPORTING
The Committee examined the financial forecasts for the 
Group including scenarios to model the impact of potential 
downturns in the housing and strategic land markets. These 
were examined by the Committee in conjunction with its 
review of the Annual Report and interim announcement. 
The Committee satisfied itself, and subsequently the Board, 
that the going concern basis of preparation continues to 
be appropriate in the context of the Group’s funding and 
liquidity position.
In accordance with provision C2.2 of the Code, the 
Committee also considered the time period over which it 
could reasonably assess the Group’s ability to continue to 
trade, taking into account the Group’s financial budget 
review period and operational forecasts. It concluded that 
this should remain a three year period as explained on page 
45. The Committee received detailed financial analysis 
based on the Group’s latest budgets with sensitivities 
applied over a three year period and determined that there 
was a reasonable expectation that the Group will be able to 
continue in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due 
over the three year period. This Committee recommended 
statements to this effect to the Board to approve for 
inclusion in the Annual Report. 
The viability statement is shown on page 45 of the 
Governance report with further explanation of the timespan 
and variables considered. 54 MJ Gleeson plc: Report and Accounts for the year ended 30 June 2017
Strategic Report Governance Report Financial Statements Further Information
CREDIT RISK MONITORING
The Group carries a number of receivables for deferred 
payments in relation to land sales. At each of the meetings 
where the Committee considered going concern and viability 
reporting, the Committee also separately examined the 
significant balances due, the level of security held and the 
performance of the counterparty to date. The Committee 
satisfied itself that the level of credit risk faced by the 
Group remained low overall. 
PROFIT RECOGNITION
At its meeting in February 2017, the Committee reviewed 
the processes, controls and assumptions used for recognising 
margin on development sites including in three particular 
areas; cost inflation, selling prices and contingencies.
As described under ‘Significant issues considered during the 
year’, the Committee satisfied itself that the associated 
processes and controls have continued to operate effectively
across the Group and the assumptions applied by management
in relation to margin recognition are appropriate. 
REVIEW OF LEGACY MATTERS
The Committee received and reviewed reports on claims 
associated with the legacy business, being the contracting 
and engineering businesses sold more than 10 years ago. 
Whilst the level of claims has reduced to an insignificant 
level, the Committee, in conjunction with the Chief 
Financial Officer, continue to monitor the status of claims 
and any liabilities. 
GROUP ACCOUNTING POLICIES MANUAL
At its meeting in February 2017, the Committee reviewed 
and approved a new version of the Group accounting policies 
manual. This was expanded from the previous edition and 
both updated and further clarified policies in a number 
of areas including margin recognition and contingencies, 
inventory provisioning, discounting of financial assets and 
liabilities and various aspects of accounting for long term 
employee benefits. There were no material changes to the 
accounting policies being applied by the Group.
REVIEW OF REPORTING STANDARDS
The Committee considered the impact of the accounting 
standards adopted in the year and, at its meeting in June 
2017, reviewed management’s assessment of the impact 
of IFRS 15 ‘Revenue from contracts with customers’ and 
IFRS 16 ‘Leases’ upon the Group’s accounting policies and 
financial statements. Further information on the impact of 
accounting standards is on pages 94 to 95.
REVIEW OF THE GROUP’S RISK REGISTER
The Committee reviewed the Group’s risk register at each of 
its meetings during the year such that, as the operational, 
political and economic environment changes, the Committee 
understands the risks faced by the Group and how these are 
addressed. This enables the Committee and the Board to 
ensure that the major risks facing the Group are monitored 
and that appropriate controls and mitigations are in place. 
As a result, the Committee and the Board understand and 
manage the balance of risks in the business.

INTERNAL AUDIT PLAN AND FINDINGS
The Committee set the Internal Audit plan for the year 
ended 30 June 2017 at its meeting in September 2016. As 
covered under ‘Internal audit’, the Committee also received 
and reviewed reports from the Internal Auditor during the 
year on internal audits conducted across  
the business. 
Significant issues considered during the year
The significant issues considered by the Committee 
during the year are those that present a risk of material 
misstatement to the Group’s financial statements being:
CARRYING VALUE OF LAND AND WORK IN PROGRESS
The most significant asset carried by the Group is inventory, 
which includes work in progress and land. The Group 
carries inventories at the lower of cost and net realisable 
value, which is dependent on estimates of total build or 
land promotion costs and future selling prices. There is, 
therefore, a risk that land and work in progress is held at a 
value in excess of the lower of cost and net realisable value. 
In addition, the allocation of inventories to cost of sales on 
the sale of individual homes is dependent on the estimates 
of total build costs and future selling prices for each site 
as a whole. These estimates, therefore, impact on the 
timing and amount of profit margin recognised on sales of 
individual homes. 
The Committee monitors the effectiveness of internal 
controls exercised over the key processes employed by the 
Group in site development activities and the forecasting of 
future costs, revenues and profits.
The Committee receives regular reports regarding sales 
of homes and the costs and possible future costs relating 
to individual sites. As covered under ‘Activities during 
the year’, the Committee at its meeting in February 
2017, reviewed the assumptions applied by management 
supporting the profit margin to be recognised on sale of 
individual homes and concluded that they are appropriate.
Effectiveness of internal controls and risk 
management systems
The Committee is responsible for reviewing and monitoring 
the effectiveness of internal controls and risk management 
systems on behalf of the Board. The Group’s system of 
internal control includes the following processes:
• The Board and management committees meet regularly 
to monitor performance against key performance 
indicators which include cash management and financial  
and operational measures. A variety of financial and 
 non-financial reports are produced to facilitate this  
review process.
• The Board has established defined lines of authority 
to ensure that significant decisions are taken at an 
appropriate level.
• The Group employs individuals of appropriate calibre 
and provides any training that is necessary to enable 
them to perform their role effectively. Key objectives 
and opportunities for improvement are identified through 
annual performance and development reviews.
• Each business function has defined procedures and 
controls to identify and minimise business, operational 
and financial risks. These procedures include segregation 
of duties, provision of regular performance information 
and exception reports, approval procedures for key 
transactions and the maintenance of proper records. 
Compliance with these procedures and controls is 
certified annually by management.
• The Group’s programme of insurance covers the major 
risks to the Group’s assets and business and is reviewed 
annually.
• Procedures are in place that require operating unit 
management to refer all investment and divestment 
decisions that exceed prescribed limits to either the 
Group Capital Committee or the Board for approval.
Regular reviews are undertaken in order to identify any 
changes in procedure that may be required in the light of 
changing circumstances. 
The effectiveness of the overall internal control framework 
and risk management process is monitored by both the Audit 
Committee and the Board. As part of this, the Committee 
reviews the annual compliance returns completed by each 
business function which confirm that key financial controls 
have been in operation throughout the year and that an 
effective control environment has been maintained. 
Each business function also completes an annual risk 
assessment. The results of this are reviewed by the 
Committee and risks identified are incorporated into the 
Group risk register. The Operating Risk Statement on pages 
33 to 35 sets out details of various risks that the business 
may face and how it mitigates them.
The Committee has satisfied itself that an appropriate 
system of internal controls and risk management processes 
have been maintained throughout the year to safeguard 
shareholder interests as well as the Group’s assets in 
accordance with the principle C2 of the Code. 56 MJ Gleeson plc: Report and Accounts for the year ended 30 June 2017
Strategic Report Governance Report Financial Statements Further Information
Whistleblowing arrangements
The Group and Company has operated a ‘whistleblowing’ 
arrangement throughout the year whereby all employees 
of the Group are able, via an independent external third 
party, to confidentially report any malpractice or matters 
of concern they have regarding the actions of employees, 
management and Directors and any breaches of the 
Company’s Anti-Bribery and Corruption Policy.
The Committee reviews the output of malpractice reporting 
every six months at its meetings in February and September. 
Anti-Bribery and Corruption Policy
The Group and Company values its long-standing reputation 
for ethical behaviour and integrity. Conducting its business 
with a zero tolerance approach to all forms of corruption is 
central to these values, the Group’s image and reputation. 
The Company policy sets out the standards expected of all 
Group employees in relation to anti-bribery and corruption 
and the Board has overall responsibility for ensuring 
this policy complies with the Group’s legal and ethical 
obligations and that everyone in our organisation complies 
with it.
This policy is also relevant for third parties who perform 
services for or on behalf of the Group. The Group expects 
those persons to adhere to this policy or have in place 
equivalent policies and procedures to combat bribery  
and corruption.
The Committee reviews a report on the registers of gifts  
and hospitality given or received by Directors and employees 
of the Group every six months at its meetings in February 
and September.
Internal audit
The Audit Committee is responsible for reviewing and 
approving the annual Internal Audit plan. This continues to 
have a broad remit across the Group focused on areas of risk 
and management judgement.
During the year, the Committee received sixteen reports 
from the Internal Auditor on the findings of internal audits 
conducted throughout the business, together with proposed 
recommendations to rectify any issues identified. The 
findings of these reports were actively debated by the 
Committee with the Internal Auditor and with management. 
The Committee reviewed the effectiveness of the Internal 
Audit function and concluded that it has operated 
effectively and provided a suitable level of independent 
scrutiny across the operations of the Group. 
External audit
As previously reported, the Board agreed that it would re-
tender the Group audit and subsequently recommended to 
shareholders that PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP be appointed 
as auditor. PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP were appointed as 
the Company’s auditor following approval by shareholders at 
the AGM on 8 December 2016.
Upon appointment PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP produced 
a detailed audit plan for the Committee, identifying their 
assessment of key risks in the Group’s financial reporting. 
For the 2017 financial year, as in prior years, the primary 
risk identified was in relation to the carrying value of land 
and work in progress. 
The Committee formulates and oversees the Group’s 
policy on monitoring external auditor objectivity and 
independence in relation to non-audit services. As a result 
of the EU Audit Reforms Regulations (as amended 11 June 
2016) the auditor is excluded from undertaking a range of 
work on behalf of the Group to ensure that the nature of 
non-audit services performed or fee income earned relative 
to the audit fees does not compromise and is not seen to 
compromise the auditor’s independence, objectivity or 
integrity. From 1 July 2016 the Company has not engaged 
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP to carry out any new non-audit 
services. From time to time non-audit services are put out 
to tender to a number of other suitable firms. 
The ratio of audit fees to non-audit fees paid to the external 
auditor, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP , in the financial year 
ended 30 June 2017 was 1 to 0.6. Details of the audit 
and non-audit fees incurred are disclosed in note 4 to the 
financial statements. 
The Committee assesses the effectiveness of the external 
audit process annually with the auditor and the Company’s 
management. The Committee holds private meetings with 
the auditor on an annual basis. Matters discussed include 
the auditor’s assessment of business risks and management 
activity thereon, the transparency and openness of 
interactions with management and confirmation that 
there has been no restriction in scope placed on them by 
management.
The Committee ensures that the auditor has exercised its 
professional scepticism. The Committee has reviewed and is 
satisfied with the performance of PricewaterhouseCoopers 
LLP . The auditors, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP , have 
indicated their willingness to continue in office, and a 
resolution that they be re-appointed will be proposed at the 
next AGM of the Company on 7 December 2017.

Remuneration Committee Report 
Statement from the Chairman of the 
Remuneration Committee
Dear Shareholder,
Our remuneration report is split into two parts as follows:
• this letter, which provides an introduction to the 
remuneration report; and
• the Annual Report on Remuneration, which describes how 
the policy was implemented in the year to June 2017 and 
the plans for the year to June 2018.
There have been no changes to the Remuneration Policy 
since it was approved by shareholders at the December 2016 
AGM and so this will not be voted on at the next AGM on  
7 December 2017, but details of the policy are included in  
this report.
Context to the Committee decisions
The Group delivered another set of strong results during the 
year with profit before tax increasing by 17.0% to £33.0m. 
The capacity of both divisions to continue growing has been 
established and margin on unit sales continued to increase. 
Cash generation has been strong with cash flow before 
dividends increasing by 41.7% to £19.7m enabling total 
dividends to increase by 65.5% to 24 pence per share. 
2017 Executive Directors’ remuneration
During the financial year the Remuneration Committee (“the 
Committee”) undertook its annual review of the Executive 
Directors’ base salaries and agreed the performance targets 
for the annual bonus for 2017.
The Group continued to perform well during the year to 
30 June 2017. The performance condition for two thirds of 
the CEOs annual bonus and the whole of the CFOs annual 
bonus was the achievement of Group profit before tax for 
both continuing and discontinued operations of between 
£27.0m and £31.0m. The performance condition for one 
third of the CEOs annual bonus was the achievement of 
strategic performance targets set by the Committee at the 
beginning of the year. The strategic performance targets 
are directly linked to the Group’s longer term strategy and 
are commercially sensitive. The targets will be shared when 
no longer commercially sensitive. The CEO completed the 
strategic performance targets. The Group achieved profit 
before tax for both continuing and discontinued operations 
of £32.8m, which is an increase of 17.6% against the 
previous year. Accordingly, annual bonus payments for 2017 
will be made at 100% of base salary for the Chief Executive 
Officer and 100% of base salary for the Chief Financial 
Officer, both to be paid in cash. 
No long term incentive plan awards vested in the year 
ended 30 June 2017. However, the October 2014 long 
term incentive award for the CEO achieved the three year 
performance condition which ended on 30 June 2017. The 
performance condition was based on the total shareholder 
return (share price measured over the three months prior

The performance condition was met in full. Accordingly, the 
290,769 share award will vest to the CEO on 1 October 2017.
The Committee granted conditional share awards under the 
Remuneration Policy approved at the AGM on 8 December 
2016 which will vest in whole or in part on 30 June 2019 if 
performance conditions have been met. The performance 
condition is based on total shareholder returns for the three 
financial years from 1 July 2016 to 30 June 2019. The award 
was made on 12 December 2016. 
2018 Executive Directors’ remuneration
The focus of the remuneration policy for the Executive 
Directors continues to have a significant proportion of 
remuneration performance-related and linked closely to the 
Group’s long term strategy.
In recognition of the CEO leading the Group’s delivery of 
record results and of achieving the medium term target 
of completing 1,000 unit sales in the year, the Committee 
increased the base salary of the CEO by 20% to £480,000 
from 1 July 2017. This increase follows an increase of 
0.75% the previous year. The CEO’s single figure of total 
remuneration during the year reduced by 70% to £879,000. 
As anticipated in the letter sent to shareholders before the 
December 2016 AGM it was the intention of the Committee 
to increase the base salary of the CFO by 20% to £300,000 
subject to “continued performance and development in the 
role”. The Committee are satisfied with the performance 
and development of the CFO and the increase became 
effective 1 July 2017.
The maximum amount payable under the annual bonus 
scheme will again be 100% of base salary. For the CEO, two 
thirds of the award will be based on profit targets and one 
third on personal or strategic performance targets. For the 
CFO, the performance condition remains wholly linked to 
profit targets.
The Committee intends to grant further conditional share 
awards at 300% of base salary for the CEO and 150% of 
base salary for the CFO. As in previous years the award 
will be conditional on Total Shareholder Return (“TSR”) 
performance measured over a period of three financial years 
and will be subject to a two-year holding period following 
the performance period.
Activities during the year
The Committee met seven times during the year, two of 
which were scheduled meetings. Papers were circulated in 
advance of each meeting for all matters considered. The 
principal activities of the Committee were as follows:
• review and approval of the remuneration of the 
Chairman, Executive Directors, senior managers and 
employees including annual pay, benefits, annual bonus 
and long term incentives;
• review and approval of Executive Director’s annual bonus 
and long term incentives and targets;
• review of Executive Director’s performance against 
annual bonus and long term incentive targets;
• design and approval of the remuneration policies;
• review of gender pay across the Group;
• appointment of remuneration consultants. KPMG LLP 
were appointed by the Committee to advise on technical 
remuneration and reporting matters; and
• commissioning of benchmarking report on directors 
remuneration.

22 September 2017 60 MJ Gleeson plc: Report and Accounts for the year ended 30 June 2017
Remuneration Policy Report
This part of the report sets out the remuneration policy for 
the Group and has been prepared in accordance with The 
Large and Medium-sized Companies and Groups (Accounts 
and Reports) (Amendment) Regulations 2013. The policy has 
been developed taking into account the principles of the 
UK Corporate Governance Code and the views of our major 
shareholders and describes the policy that was approved by 
shareholders at the AGM on 8 December 2016 onwards. 
Policy overview 
In setting the remuneration policy for the Executive 
Directors, the Committee takes into account the following 
general principles:
• to attract, retain and motivate the best possible person 
for each position, while aligning remuneration with 
shareholder interests;
• to ensure that the remuneration packages are simple and 
fair in design so that they are valued by participants;
• to ensure that the fixed element of remuneration (salary, 
pension and other benefits) is determined in line with 
market rates, taking account of individual performance 
and experience, and that a significant proportion of 
the total remuneration package is determined by 
performance;
• to recognise the importance of rewarding exceptional 
performance (but not under-performance) in both the 
short and long term;
• to set carefully all targets and associated sliding scale 
ranges to ensure that performance is incrementally 
rewarded and that executives are not inadvertently 
motivated to take inappropriate business risks (including 
environmental, social, health, safety and governance 
risks); and
• to provide a significant proportion of performance linked 
pay in shares allowing executives to build significant 
shareholdings in the business, thereby, aligning the 
executive’s interests with those of the Company’s 
shareholders.
Components of Directors’ remuneration 
The key elements of the remuneration package for each Director are set out in the table below:
Element BASE SALARY
Purpose and link  
to strategy
Provides a base level of remuneration to support recruitment and retention of Executive 
Directors with the necessary experience and expertise to deliver the Group’s strategy.
Operation Salaries are normally reviewed annually.
Salary levels are set with reference to:
• personal performance • Company performance
• inflation and earnings forecasts • state of the market place generally
• increases elsewhere in the Group  • similar roles in the workforce generally
The Committee may on occasion recognise a change in circumstances such as assumed additional 
responsibility or an increase in the scale or scope of the role.
Individuals who are recruited or promoted to the Board may, on occasion, have their salaries 
set below the targeted policy level until they become established in their role. In such cases 
subsequent increases in salary may be higher than the general rises for employees until the 
target positioning is achieved.
There are no provisions for recovery or withholding of payment.
Maximum opportunity The Committee ensures that maximum salary levels are positioned in line with companies of a 
similar size and complexity.
Salary increases for Executive Directors will take into account the increase in salaries for all 
employees.
The Company will set out in the section headed Annual Report on Remuneration, in the following 
financial year, the salaries for that year for each of the Executive Directors.
Performance targets N/A
Strategic Report Governance Report Financial Statements Further Information MJ Gleeson plc: Report and Accounts for the year ended 30 June 2017 61
Strategic Report Governance Report Financial Statements Further Information
Element BENEFITS
Purpose and link  
to strategy
Provides a benefits package in line with practice relative to comparators to enable the Company 
to recruit and retain Executive Directors with the experience and expertise to deliver the Group’s 
strategy.
Operation The Company provide cash benefits and benefits in kind to Executive Directors. These include but 
are not limited to:
• Company car or cash equivalent
• private fuel
• private medical insurance – family cover
• life insurance
• permanent health insurance
• annual health check
• holiday and sick pay
• professional subscriptions
• reimbursement of expenses incurred on Group matters
The Committee recognises the need to maintain suitable flexibility in the benefits provided to 
ensure it is able to support the objective of attracting and retaining personnel in order to deliver 
the Group strategy. Additional benefits may therefore be offered such as relocation allowances 
on recruitment.
There are no provisions for recovery or withholding of payment.
Maximum opportunity The value of benefits is based on the underlying cost to the Group and individual circumstances. 
There is no prescribed maximum but benefits are in line with market practice.
Performance targets N/A
Element PENSION
Purpose and link  
to strategy
Provides a pension provision in line with practice relative to comparators to enable the Company 
to recruit and retain Executive Directors with the experience and expertise to deliver the Group’s 
strategy.
Operation The Company will contribute to the Group’s defined contribution pension scheme, or to personal 
pension arrangements at the request of the individual. The Company contributes at an agreed 
percentage of salary.
The Company may also consider a cash alternative (e.g. where a Director has reached the HMRC’s 
lifetime or annual allowance limit).
Other than basic salary, no element of the Directors’ remuneration is pensionable. Salary 
supplements are not included in base salary to calculate other benefits and incentive 
opportunities.
There are no provisions for recovery or withholding of payment.
Maximum opportunity The maximum Company contribution or pension allowance is 25% of salary.
Directors who are members of the pension scheme may elect to exchange part of their salary in 
return for pension contributions.
Performance targets N/A Element ANNUAL BONUS
Purpose and link  
to strategy
To incentivise the achievement of key financial and strategic targets for the forthcoming year 
without encouraging excessive risk taking.
Operation The Committee will determine the bonus to be delivered following the end of the relevant 
financial year.
The Company will set out in the section headed Annual Report on Remuneration, in the following 
financial year, the nature of the targets and details of the performance conditions, unless they 
are commercially sensitive, and weightings and their level of satisfaction for the year being 
reported. 
Normally payable in cash, but Executive Directors may elect to have their bonus payable in 
shares.
Performance targets are reviewed annually by the Committee and can include financial and non-
financial targets.
The Committee has the discretion to override the formulaic outturn of the bonus to determine 
the appropriate level of bonus payable where it believes the outcome is not truly reflective of 
performance and to ensure fairness to both shareholders and participants.
Malus and Clawback provisions apply. 
The circumstances in which the Malus clause may apply include; material errors or misstatements 
in the audited financial statements of the Group or any Group company; discovery of errors, 
inaccuracies or misleading information used to achieve targets, conditions, bonus or share 
awards; fraud or gross misconduct; and events or behaviour leading to censure by a regulatory 
authority or leading to a significant reputational damage. 
Clawback trigger events include; material errors or misstatements in the audited financial 
statements of the Group or any Group company; discovery of errors, inaccuracies or misleading 
information used to achieve targets, conditions, bonus or share awards; fraud or gross 
misconduct; and events or behaviour leading to censure by a regulatory authority or leading to a 
significant reputational damage. 
Maximum opportunity Maximum opportunity of 150% of base salary.
Percentage of bonus maximum earned for levels of performance:
Threshold: 0%
Maximum: 100%
Performance targets An award under the annual bonus is subject to satisfying financial and strategic / operational 
performance / personal performance conditions and targets measured over a period of one 
financial year. 
A minimum of two thirds of the bonus shall be based on financial performance measures.
The Committee will determine the bonus to be delivered following the end of the relevant 
financial year.
The Committee is of the opinion that given the commercial sensitivity arising in relation to the 
detailed financial targets used for the annual bonus, disclosing precise targets for the Annual 
Bonus in advance would not be in shareholder interests. Targets, performance achieved and 
awards made will be published at the end of the performance period so shareholders can fully 
assess the basis for any pay-outs under the Annual Bonus.

Strategic Report Governance Report Financial Statements Further Information
Element ANNUAL BONUS (CONTINUED)
Performance targets
(continued)
In exceptional circumstances the Committee retains the discretion to: 
• change the performance measures and targets and the weighting attached to the performance 
measures and targets part-way through a performance year if there is a significant and material 
event which causes the Committee to believe the original measures, weightings and targets are 
no longer appropriate; and
• make downward or upward adjustments to the amount of bonus earned resulting from the 
application of the performance measures, if the Committee believe that the bonus outcomes 
are not a fair and accurate reflection of business performance.
Any adjustments or discretion applied by the Committee will be fully disclosed in the following 
year’s Remuneration Report.
The financial targets incorporate an appropriate sliding scale range around a challenging target.
Element LONG-TERM INCENTIVE PLAN (“LTIP”)
Purpose and link  
to strategy
The purpose of the LTIP is to incentivise and reward Executive Directors in relation to long term 
performance and achievement of Company Strategy. 
This will better align Executive Directors’ interests with the long-term interests of the Company 
and act as a retention mechanism. 
The award is designed to incentivise Executive Directors to maximise Total Shareholder Return 
“TSR” by successfully delivering the Company’s strategy and to share in the resulting increase in 
total shareholder value. 
Operation Awards are granted annually to Executive Directors in the form of a conditional share award, nil 
cost option or restricted share award. 
These will vest at the end of a three year period subject to: 
• the Executive Director’s continued employment at the date of vesting; and
• satisfaction of the performance conditions.
Performance targets are reviewed by the Committee for each new award.
Details of the performance conditions for grants made in the year are set out in the Annual 
Report on Remuneration.
Amounts equivalent to any dividends or shareholder distributions may be made in respect of 
awards at vesting, if the Committee so determines.
Vested shares will be subject to a two-year holding period, during which participants cannot sell 
their vested LTIP awards (other than to cover Income Tax and NIC).
Malus and Clawback provisions apply. 
The circumstances in which the Malus clause may apply include; material errors or misstatements 
in the audited financial statements of the Group or any Group company; discovery of errors, 
inaccuracies or misleading information used to achieve targets, conditions, bonus or share 
awards; fraud or gross misconduct; and events or behaviour leading to censure by a regulatory 
authority or leading to a significant reputational damage. 
Clawback trigger events include; material errors or misstatements in the audited financial 
statements of the Group or any Group company; discovery of errors, inaccuracies or misleading 
information used to achieve targets, conditions, bonus or share awards; fraud or gross 
misconduct; and events or behaviour leading to censure by a regulatory authority or leading to a 
significant reputational damage.  Element LONG-TERM INCENTIVE PLAN (“LTIP”) CONTINUED
Maximum opportunity Awards of up to 300% of base salary for the Chief Executive Officer and 200% for other Directors.
For awards made in 2017, the CEO was awarded 300% of base salary and the CFO 150% of  
base salary.
20% of the award will vest for threshold performance.
100% of the award will vest for maximum performance. There is straight line vesting between 
these points.
Performance targets The performance condition for the 2017 LTIP awards is absolute TSR and a fairness test, which 
would consider the underlying financial performance of the Company , including, but not limited 
to, the profitability of the Company and shareholder value creation including the ability of 
shareholders to access this value creation through the liquidity of the shares.
The Committee may change the balance of the measures, or use different measures for 
subsequent awards, as appropriate.
No material change will be made to the type of performance conditions without prior major 
shareholder consultation.
In exceptional circumstances the Committee retains the discretion to:
• vary, substitute or waive the performance conditions applying to LTIP Awards if the Board 
considers it appropriate and that the new performance conditions are deemed reasonable and 
are not materially less difficult to satisfy than the original conditions; and
• make downward or upward adjustments to the amount vesting under the LTIP resulting from 
the application of the performance measures if they believe that the outcomes are not a fair 
and accurate reflection of business performance.
Element HMRC APPROVED ALL-EMPLOYEE SCHEME
Purpose and link  
to strategy
The HMRC approved all-employee scheme has been designed to encourage all employees to 
become shareholders in the Company and thereby align their interests with shareholders.
Operation The Company operates an all employee scheme in which the Executive Directors are eligible to 
participate (which is in line with HMRC legislation and is open to all eligible staff).
Maximum opportunity The maximums set by legislation from time to time.

Remuneration policy for Non-Executive Directors
Element FEES FOR NON-EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
Purpose and link  
to strategy
Provides a level of fees to support recruitment and retention of Non-Executive Directors and a 
Chairman with the necessary experience to advise and assist with establishing and monitoring the 
Group’s strategic objectives.
Operation Fees for Non-Executive Directors are determined by the Chairman and the Executive Directors. 
Fees for the Chairman are set by the Remuneration Committee. Fees are set at levels with 
reference to sector, FTSE Small Cap and general Non-Executive Director benchmarking data as 
appropriate. 
Fees are paid in cash and are not performance related. Non-Executive Directors are paid 
an annual fee and additional fees are paid to the Chairmen of the Audit, Remuneration and 
Nomination Committees to reflect the additional responsibilities. 
The Chairman is part of the Group private health scheme. There are no other benefits or 
incentive schemes for Non-Executive Directors.
Maximum opportunity There is no prescribed maximum annual increase. In general the level of fee increase for 
the Non-Executive Directors and the Chairman will be set taking account of any change in 
responsibility and will take into account the general rise in salaries across the UK workforce.
The Company will set out in the section headed Annual Report on Remuneration, in the following 
financial year, the fees for that year.
The Company will pay reasonable expenses incurred by the Non-Executive Directors and 
Chairman and may settle any tax incurred in relation to these.
Performance targets N/A
Selection of performance measures and 
target setting
In the selection of performance measures the Committee 
takes into account the Group’s strategic objectives and 
short and long-term business priorities. The performance 
measures selected reward the delivery of stretching 
financial performance and the creation of shareholder value.
The performance targets chosen are set in accordance 
with the Group’s operating plan and are reviewed annually 
to ensure they are sufficiently stretching. In selecting the 
targets the Committee also takes into account analysts’ 
forecasts, economic conditions and the Committee’s 
expectation of performance over the relevant period.
Remuneration policy for the broader 
employee population
The executive remuneration framework set out in this report
follows similar principles as that applied to the Group’s 
senior leadership team to ensure our senior management 
team is rewarded on a consistent basis. Any differences that 
exist arise either because of the Remuneration Committee’s 
assessment of business need or commercial necessity. 
The principles that underpin our executive remuneration 
philosophy also cascade throughout the organisation, 
although quantum will vary by level and the provision of 
certain components of remuneration (such as benefits, 
allowances and long-term incentives) will vary by seniority.
How the Committee will use its discretion
Incentive plans, including annual bonus and LTIP , will be 
operated in line with the rules of each scheme or plan 
together with any relevant laws and regulations. However, 
it is important that the Committee retains appropriate 
discretion (as is customary) over the administration and 
operation of the incentive plans.
Discretion will include, but is not limited to, the following in 
relation to incentive schemes:
• who is invited to participate or receive grants of awards;
• the size and timing of award grants or payments;
• discretion required when changes or adjustments are 
required in special circumstances (e.g. change of control, 
rights issues, special corporate or dividend events, or 
change in business strategy);
• the annual review of performance measures and targets 
for the annual bonus and incentive schemes (including 
LTIP) from year to year; • the determination of vesting (or payment), and the 
treatment of leavers and vesting for leavers;
• the annual review of performance measures and 
weighting, and targets for incentive plans over time; and
• as permitted by HMRC and other regulations, in respect 
of Sharesave and any Share Incentive Plans.
In relation to incentive schemes including annual bonus 
and LTIP , the Committee may adjust performance measures 
and/or targets if these have ceased to be appropriate 
provided that such adjusted measures or targets will not 
be materially less difficult to satisfy. Any use of the above 
discretions would, where relevant, be explained in future 
Directors Remuneration Reports and may, as appropriate, 
be the subject of consultation with the Company’s major 
shareholders.
Legacy arrangements
For the avoidance of doubt, in approving the Policy 
report, authority is given to the Company to honour any 
commitments entered into with current and former Directors 
that have been disclosed previously to shareholders. It is also 
part of this policy that we will honour payments or awards 
crystallising after the effective date of this policy but arising 
from commitments entered into prior to the effective date 
of the new policy, or at a time when the relevant individual 
was not a Director of the Company. The Company will also 
have the authority to meet any claims against the Company 
arising as a result of a Director’s termination.
Illustration of the application of  
Remuneration Policy
The charts below illustrate the future remuneration 
packages of the CEO and CFO under the policy set for the 
year to 30 June 2018 onwards for three indicative levels of 
performance – minimum, expected and maximum:
For the purpose of this analysis, the following assumptions 
have been made:
• fixed elements comprise base salary, pension and other 
benefits. As an example, for the Chief Executive Officer, 
fixed elements comprise salary of £480,000, pension of 
£72,000 and benefits of £20,000;
• base salary levels applying on 1 July 2017;
• benefit levels are assumed to be the same as the year 
ended 30 June 2017;
• minimum performance assumes no award under the 
annual bonus and no vesting is achieved under the 
performance share plan;
• expected performance assumes 50% of annual bonus is 
earned and threshold vesting for the performance  
share plan;
• maximum performance assumes full bonus pay out and 
full vesting under the performance share plan; and
• share price movement has been excluded from the above 
analysis.
Note the one-off CEO award made last year of up to £3m 
conditional on achieving significant shareholder value 
has not been included in the CEO’s scenario chart as it is 
a one-off award and does not form part of the recurring 
remuneration.
Service agreements and policy in respect  
of loss of office
All Executive Directors’ service agreements are terminable 
on 12 months notice. In circumstances of termination 
on notice, the Committee will determine an equitable 
compensation package, having regard to the particular 
circumstances of the case. The Committee has discretion to 
require notice to be worked or to make payment in lieu of

notice or to place the Director on garden leave for the  
notice period.
The dates of the Executive Directors’ service agreements 
who served during the year are:
Executive Director Date of service agreement
Jolyon Harrison 1 July 2012
Stefan Allanson 29 June 2015
Base salary, pension and benefits
In case of payment in lieu of notice or garden leave, base 
salary, employer pension contributions and employee 
benefits will be paid for the period of notice served on 
garden leave or paid in lieu of notice. 
Annual bonus
Where an Executive Director’s employment is terminated 
after the end of a financial year but before the bonus 
payment is made, the Executive Director may be eligible 
for a bonus award for that financial year subject to an 
assessment based on financial and personal performance 
achieved over the period.
Where an Executive Director’s employment is terminated 
during a financial year, a pro-rata bonus award for the period 
worked in that financial year may be payable subject to an 
assessment based on financial and personal performance.
There is no payment in the event of gross misconduct, wilful 
neglect or certain other specified circumstances. 
Long-term incentive plan
Awards under the Long Term Incentive Plan will be 
determined by the Plan rules which contain discretionary 
good leaver provisions for designated reasons  
(i.e. participants who leave early on account of injury, 
disability, death, a sale of their employer or business 
in which they were employed, statutory redundancy, 
retirement or any other reason at the discretion of the 
Committee). In these circumstances a participant’s awards 
will not be forfeited on cessation of employment and 
instead will vest on the normal vesting date. In exceptional 
circumstances, the Committee may decide that the 
participant’s awards will vest early on the date of cessation 
of employment. In either case, the extent to which the 
awards will vest depends on the extent to which the 
performance conditions have been satisfied and a pro rata 
reduction of the awards will be applied by reference to the 
time of cessation (although the Committee has discretion to 
dis-apply time pro rating if the circumstances warrant it). A 
two-year holding period will apply in respect of shares that 
vest in the event of cessation of employment. “Bad” leavers 
forfeit their awards on cessation of employment.
In the event of a change of control or substantial exit awards 
will be tested against the relevant performance targets at 
the date of relevant event. Awards will be pro-rated for 
time served and no holding period will apply. If deemed 
appropriate, the Committee has discretion to determine 
whether or not vesting of an award shall be reduced on a 
pro rata basis to take account of the period of time that has 
elapsed from the grant date to the date of the  
relevant event.
One-off CEO award
For a “good” leaver, the award will be tested against the 
relevant performance targets on cessation of employment 
and the level of vesting determined. A “bad” leaver will 
forfeit their award on cessation of employment.
In the event of change of control or substantial exit within 
3 years of grant which is deemed by the Committee to have 
delivered value to shareholders, the award will vest in full. If 
the Committee deems that a change of control or substantial 
event has not delivered value to shareholders, then the 
award will be forfeited.
Chairman and other Non-Executive Directors’ 
terms of engagement
The Chairman and the Non-Executive Directors are not 
employees; they have letters of appointment which set out 
their duties and responsibilities. The dates of each Non-
Executive Directors’ original appointment are as follows:
Non-Executive Director Date of original 
appointment
Expiry of  
current term
Dermot Gleeson 27/11/1975 30/09/2017
Ross Ancell 01/10/2006 30/09/2017
Colin Dearlove 03/12/2007 30/09/2017
Christopher Mills 01/01/2009 30/09/2017
All Non-Executive Directors have specific terms of 
engagement being an initial period of three years which 
thereafter may be extended on an annual basis, subject 
to re-election at each AGM. The appointment of the 
Chairman may be terminated on six months’ notice and the 
appointment of the other Non-Executive Directors may be 
terminated on one month’s notice. 68 MJ Gleeson plc: Report and Accounts for the year ended 30 June 2017
Recruitment policy
The remuneration of a new executive Director will include 
salary, benefits, pension and participation in the annual 
bonus and LTIP schemes normally in accordance with the 
policy for executive Directors’ remuneration. Salaries for 
new hires will be set to reflect their skills and experience 
and the market rate for the role. 
If it is considered appropriate to appoint a new Director on 
a below market salary (for example, to allow them to gain 
experience in the role) their salary may be increased to a 
market level by way of a series of above inflation increases 
over two to three years. 
Although it is not the Company’s policy to provide buy-outs 
as a matter of course, the Committee may offer additional 
cash and/or share-based elements (on a one-time basis or 
ongoing) when it considers these to be in the best interests 
of the Group (and therefore shareholders). Any such 
payments would be based solely on remuneration lost when 
leaving the former employer and would reflect the delivery 
mechanism, time horizons and performance requirement 
attaching to that remuneration. The Committee may then 
grant up to the equivalent value as the lapsed value, where 
possible, under the Company’s incentive plans. To the extent 
that it was not possible or practical to provide the buy-out 
within the terms of the Company’s existing incentive plans, 
a bespoke arrangement would be used.
In the case of an internal appointment, any variable 
pay element awarded in respect of the prior role may 
be allowed to pay out according to its terms on grant, 
adjusted as relevant to take into account the appointment. 
In addition, any other ongoing remuneration obligations 
existing prior to appointment may continue, provided that 
they are put to shareholders for approval at the first AGM 
following their appointment.
The Committee may also agree that the Company will 
compensate executives, both internal and external, for 
certain relocation expenses as appropriate.
Statement of consideration of employment 
conditions elsewhere in the Group
The Committee does not consult with employees on 
Directors’ remuneration but regularly reviews the 
remuneration of staff throughout the Group to ensure that 
it is attuned to general pay and conditions when considering 
the remuneration of executive pay. For example, in 
determining salary increases for the Executive Directors the 
Committee looks at salary increases across the Group.
The Committee is proud of its commitment that all 
employees are paid no less than the Real Living Wage set by 
the Living Wage Foundation and to disclose the number of 
higher paid employees in the Group:

representative bodies on remuneration matters, particularly 
if any material changes are proposed to the remuneration 
policy. In these instances the Committee seeks feedback 
from investors and develops and considers its proposals in 
light of this feedback.

Notes to the single total figure of remuneration
Taxable benefits provided to Executive Directors
The main benefits available to the Executive Directors during the year to 30 June 2017 (and their associated values) were: 
car allowance of £13,000 for Jolyon Harrison and £13,000 for Stefan Allanson; car fuel of £4,757 for Jolyon Harrison and 
£1,966 for Stefan Allanson; and private medical insurance of £1,436 for Jolyon Harrison and £748 for Stefan Allanson. This 
package of benefits is unchanged from 2016.
Determination of annual bonus
The CEOs annual performance-related bonus for the year to 30 June 2017 was based two-thirds upon achieving a profit 
related target and one third upon achieving a strategic performance target. The CFOs annual performance-related bonus for 
the year to 30 June 2017 was based wholly upon achieving a profit related target. Determination of annual bonus (continued)
The profit related target for both the CEO and CFO was the Group’s pre-exceptional profit before tax, for both continuing 
and discontinued operations in the year to 30 June 2017, (the “Profit Measure”), with the following target figures and straight 
line vesting between the relevant target figures.
Target Profit measure 
£m
Bonus achievable as 
percentage of salary
Threshold 27.0 0%
Target 31.0 100%
The Profit Measure achieved for the year to 30 June 2017 was £32.8m, as per the basis of calculation above, and exceeded 
that of the prior year by 17.6%. The CEO fully achieved the strategic performance targets. As a result, the annual bonus 
payments for 2017 will be made, in cash, at 100% of base salary for the CEO and 100% of base salary for the CFO. 
Long Term Incentive Plan – Performance Share Plan
The LTIP columns refer to the Company’s Performance Share Plans, which delivers shares to the Executive Directors  
subject to performance targets being reached. The performance target is based on Total Shareholder Return over a three 
year period. 
In the year to 30 June 2017 share awards were made to Jolyon Harrison and Stefan Allanson.

Total Shareholder Return performance
We have chosen to compare the Company’s total shareholder return performance over the last eight years with the total 
shareholder return for the FTSE Small Cap Index, of which the Company is a member, and a comparator index of listed 
housebuilders. The Comparator Group consists of a group of listed housebuilders comprising Barratt Developments, Bellway, 
Bovis Homes, Crest Nicholson, Persimmon, Redrow, Taylor Wimpey and Telford Homes.
Total shareholder return is the sum of share price appreciation and dividends paid during the year.

BASE SALARIES
After taking into consideration the increases to Group employees’ salaries on 1 July 2017 (monthly paid employees  
received an average 4.3% base salary increase), the Committee has awarded salary increases of 20% to the Chief Executive 
Officer and 20% to the Chief Financial Officer from 1 July 2017. The increase in the base salary of the Chief Financial Officer 
was set out in the Remuneration Policy letter to shareholders at the December 2016 AGM. In the year to 30 June 2017, the 
increase in the base salary of the Chief Executive Officer was 0.8% and the average annual increase over the last three years 
was 3.6%.

ANNUAL BONUS
The maximum bonus that can be earned in the year will be 100% of base salary for the Chief Executive Officer and 100% of 
base salary for the Chief Financial Officer. This is in line with last year for both the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief 
Financial Officer.
The Committee has decided that the Chief Executive Officer’s performance conditions for the 2018 annual bonus will be 
based on 2/3 profit before tax and 1/3 strategic objectives. The Chief Financial Officer’s performance condition will be a 
profit before tax target. The profit before tax targets are commercially sensitive but will be disclosed in the next Annual 
Report on Remuneration. The Committee considers that the target it has set is stretching. The bonus continues to be subject 
to robust malus and clawback provisions.
LONG TERM INCENTIVE PLAN AWARDS (LTIP)
The October 2014 share award of 290,769 shares to the Chief Executive Officer will vest on 1 October 2017 as the 
performance conditions have been met in full. 
The Committee proposes to make awards to the Executive Directors in the year to 30 June 2018, in line with the policy 
approved by shareholders at the 2016 AGM. These awards are expected to be at 300% and 150% of salary for Jolyon 
Harrison and Stefan Allanson respectively. The performance measures are expected to include an absolute TSR target and a 
fairness test which would consider the underlying financial performance of the Company , including, but not limited to, the 
profitability of the Company and shareholder value creation including the ability of shareholders to access this value creation 
through the liquidity of the shares.  
PENSION
There are no changes to pension benefits for 2018 other than to increase in line with salary; current arrangements are set out 
on page 70.
Chairman and Non-Executive Directors fees
The Committee has agreed that the Chairman’s fee for 2018 should increase by £9,500, to £120,000 with effect from  
1 July 2017 which includes the additional fee of £10,500 for chairing the Nomination Committee. This increase was made 
to reflect the increase in workload as the Group grows and as governance requirements develop. An external benchmarking 
exercise was also performed. The Board as a whole determine the fees for the Non-Executive Directors. The fees for the 
Non-Executive Directors increased by £5,500 to £45,000 plus an additional, unchanged, fee of £10,500 for chairing a Board 
Committee. The increase was made again to reflect the increasing workload as the Group grows and following an external 
benchmarking exercise. The Non-Executive Directors did not receive a fee increase in the previous year. The Remuneration Committee
During the year under review the Committee was chaired by Ross Ancell. The other committee member is Colin Dearlove. Both 
of the Directors are independent Non-Executive Directors and they have no personal financial interest in matters to be decided, 
no potential conflicts of interest arising from cross directorships and no day-to-day involvement in running the business. 
Biographical details of the members of the Committee are shown on pages 38 and 39, and details of their attendance at the 
meetings of the Committee during the year ended 30 June 2017 are shown on page 42.
Role and responsibilities of the Remuneration Committee
The Committee’s primary purpose is to make recommendations to the Board on the Group’s framework for executive 
remuneration. The Board has also delegated responsibility to the Committee for determining the remuneration, benefits 
and contractual arrangements of the Chairman and the Executive Directors. No individual is involved in deciding their own 
remuneration.
The Committee has written terms of reference, which are available on the MJ Gleeson plc section of its website at  
www.mjgleesonplc.com, and its responsibilities include:
• recommending to, and agreeing with, the Board the policy for executive and senior management remuneration;
• agreeing the terms and conditions of employment for Executive Directors, including their annual remuneration and 
pension arrangements, and reviewing such provisions for senior management;
• agreeing the measures and targets for any performance related bonus and share schemes;
• agreeing the remuneration of the Chairman of the Board;
• ensuring that, on termination, contractual terms and payments made are fair both to the Company and the individual so 
that failure is not rewarded; and
• agreeing the terms of reference of any remuneration consultants it appoints.
Remuneration Committee – Support and Advice
The Committee is supported by the Human Resources Director, Beth Broughton, and the Company Secretary, Stefan Allanson. 
The Company also took advice from PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP who were paid £50,000 during the year and KPMG LLP 
who were paid £nil during the year as they were appointed after the year end. The Committee is satisfied that the appointment 
of these advisors is in accordance with the Company’s policy on the provision of non-audit services to the Group and the 
external advice received is independent.
Statement of voting at the Annual General Meeting

remuneration report and remuneration policy are shown in the table below. The Board and Remuneration Committee have

Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities
Statement of Directors’ responsibilities in 
respect of the Annual Report and the  
financial statements
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual 
Report and the financial statements in accordance with 
applicable law and regulation. 
Company law requires the Directors to prepare financial 
statements for each financial year. Under that law the 
Directors have prepared the Group financial statements 
in accordance with International Financial Reporting 
Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union and 
parent company financial statements in accordance with 
International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as 
adopted by the European Union. Under company law the 
Directors must not approve the financial statements unless 
they are satisfied that they give a true and fair view of the 
state of affairs of the Group and parent company and of 
the profit or loss of the Group and parent company for that 
period. In preparing the financial statements, the Directors 
are required to: 
• select suitable accounting policies and then apply them 
consistently;
• state whether applicable IFRSs as adopted by the 
European Union have been followed for the Group 
financial statements and IFRSs as adopted by the 
European Union have been followed for the parent 
company financial statements, subject to any material 
departures disclosed and explained in the financial 
statements;
• make judgements and accounting estimates that are 
reasonable and prudent; and
• prepare the financial statements on the going concern 
basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Group 
and parent company will continue in business. 
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate 
accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain 
the Group and parent company’s transactions and disclose 
with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position 
of the Group and parent company and enable them to 
ensure that the financial statements and the Directors’ 
Remuneration Report comply with the Companies Act 2006 
and, as regards the Group financial statements, Article 4 of 
the IAS Regulation.
The Directors are also responsible for safeguarding the 
assets of the Group and parent company and hence for 
taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of 
fraud and other irregularities.
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and 
integrity of the parent company’s website. Legislation in the 
United Kingdom governing the preparation and dissemination 
of financial statements may differ from legislation in other 
jurisdictions.
The Directors consider that the Annual Report and accounts, 
taken as a whole, is fair, balanced and understandable 
and provides the information necessary for shareholders 
to assess the Group and parent company’s performance, 
business model and strategy.
Each of the Directors, whose names and functions are listed 
in ‘Board of Directors’ confirm that, to the best of their 
knowledge:
• the parent company financial statements, which have 
been prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by 
the European Union, give a true and fair view of the 
assets, liabilities, financial position and profit of the 
company;
• the Group financial statements, which have been 
prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the 
European Union, give a true and fair view of the assets, 
liabilities, financial position and profit of the Group; and
• the Strategic Report includes a fair review of the 
development and performance of the business and the 
position of the Group and parent company, together with 
a description of the principal risks and uncertainties that 
it faces.

Members of MJ Gleeson plc
 
Report on the audit of the financial statements
OPINION
In our opinion, MJ Gleeson plc’s group financial statements 
and parent company financial statements (the “financial 
statements”): 
• give a true and fair view of the state of the group’s and 
of the parent company’s affairs as at 30 June 2017 and 
of the group’s profit and the group’s and the parent 
company’s cash flows for the year then ended;
• have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs 
as adopted by the European Union and as applied in 
accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 
2006; and
• have been prepared in accordance with the requirements 
of the Companies Act 2006 and, as regards the group 
financial statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation.
We have audited the financial statements, included within 
the Report and Accounts (the “Annual Report”), which 
comprise: the group and parent company statements of 
financial position as at 30 June 2017; the group income 
statement and statement of comprehensive income, the 
group and parent company statements of cash flows, and 
the group and parent company statements of changes 
in equity for the year then ended; and the notes to the 
financial statements, which include a description of the 
significant accounting policies.
Our opinion is consistent with our reporting to the Audit 
Committee.
 
BASIS FOR OPINION
We conducted our audit in accordance with International 
Standards on Auditing (UK) (“ISAs (UK)”) and applicable law. 
Our responsibilities under ISAs (UK) are further described in 
the Auditors’ responsibilities for the audit of the financial 
statements section of our report. We believe that the audit 
evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to 
provide a basis for our opinion.
Independence
We remained independent of the group in accordance 
with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our 
audit of the financial statements in the UK, which includes 
the FRC’s Ethical Standard as applicable to listed public 
interest entities, and we have fulfilled our other ethical 
responsibilities in accordance with these requirements.
To the best of our knowledge and belief, we declare that 
non-audit services prohibited by the FRC’s Ethical Standard 
were not provided to the group or the parent company.
Other than those disclosed in note 4 to the financial 
statements, we have provided no non-audit services to the 
group or the parent company in the period from 1 July 2016 
to 30 June 2017.
OUR AUDIT APPROACH
Overview
Materiality
Audit scope
Key audit
matters
• £1,650,000 - group financial 
statements
• based on 5% of profit before tax.
• £1,567,500 - Parent company 
financial statements
• based on 1% of total assets (capped 
at 95% of group materiality). 
• The reporting units where we 
performed audit work accounted 
for 100% of the group’s profit 
before tax and 100% of the group’s 
total assets.
• Carrying value of land and work in 
progress (group).
The scope of our audit
As part of designing our audit, we determined materiality 
and assessed the risks of material misstatement in the 
financial statements. In particular , we looked at where 
the directors made subjective judgements, for example in 
respect of significant accounting estimates that involved 
making assumptions and considering future events that 
are inherently uncertain. As in all of our audits we also 
addressed the risk of management override of internal 
controls, including evaluating whether there was evidence 
of bias by the directors that represented a risk of material 
misstatement due to fraud. 
Key audit matters
Key audit matters are those matters that, in the auditors’ 
professional judgement, were of most significance in the 
audit of the financial statements of the current period 
and include the most significant assessed risks of material 
misstatement (whether or not due to fraud) identified by 
the auditors, including those which had the greatest effect 
on: the overall audit strategy; the allocation of resources 
in the audit; and directing the efforts of the engagement 
team. These matters, and any comments we make on the 
results of our procedures thereon, were addressed in the 
context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, 
and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide 
a separate opinion on these matters. This is not a complete 
list of all risks identified by our audit.  Key audit matter How our audit addressed the key audit matter
Carrying value of land and work in progress
We focused upon this area because the value of the group’s 
land and work in progress represent a significant proportion 
of assets in the group statement of financial position.
Further, determining the carrying value of land and work in 
progress requires a high degree of judgement.
For work in progress in Gleeson Homes, the key judgements 
include forecasting future costs to complete and selling 
prices which can be affected by market conditions and 
unexpected events, whilst land valuations in the segment 
require provision assessments to take place to ensure that 
net realisable values are not below cost.
For land and work in progress in Gleeson Homes, we:
• Assessed the adequacy of controls over site valuations, 
including costs to complete, sales prices and the 
authorisation and recording of costs, including testing of 
controls over the allocation of costs to the correct sites.
• Visited a sample of sites to confirm the existence and 
condition of the work in progress, and also to evaluate 
the reasonableness of the assessment of stage of 
completion.
• Sample tested and agreed certain costs incurred during 
the year included within land and work in progress to 
supporting evidence as well as reviewing the proportion 
of that expenditure recognised as a cost of sale in the 
year in respect of units sold.
• Tested the percentage completion of units across a 
sample of sites and checked that forecasts have been 
appropriately updated for expected costs and selling 
prices to completion. We also assessed the level of gross 
margins achieved against those recorded previously and 
future forecasts.
• Assessed the historical accuracy of management’s 
forecasting.
• Discussed a sample of sites with management in order 
to assess the reasonableness of net realisable values 
and corroborated the explanations received back to 
supporting documentation.
• Performed an independent assessment of cost accruals 
and build contingency via enquiry and corroboration to 
supporting evidence.
In Gleeson Strategic Land, the valuation of work in progress 
requires judgement regarding the future viability of each 
project. Based upon this assessment, it may be necessary 
to record provisions to determine the final carrying value of 
work in progress for each site.
For work in progress in Gleeson Strategic Land, we:
• Tested a sample of costs incurred during the year.
• Tested the transfer from work in progress to cost of sales 
for those sites sold during the year.
• Discussed and challenged the status of a sample 
of projects with management and corroborated

How we tailored the audit scope
We tailored the scope of our audit to ensure that we performed enough work to be able to give an opinion on the financial 
statements as a whole, taking into account the structure of the group and the parent company, the accounting processes and 
controls, and the industry in which they operate.
The group is organised into two main operating divisions being Gleeson Homes and Gleeson Strategic Land.
The group financial statements are a consolidation of the 8 reporting units within these two business lines and the group’s 
centralised functions.
Of the group’s 8 reporting units, we identified 8 which, in our view, required an audit of their complete financial information, 
either due to their size or their risk characteristics. 
This, together with additional procedures performed on the group’s centralised functions, gave us the evidence we needed 
for our opinion on the group financial statements as a whole.
All work was performed by the group audit team. 
 
Materiality
The scope of our audit was influenced by our application of materiality . We set certain quantitative thresholds for 
materiality. These, together with qualitative considerations, helped us to determine the scope of our audit and the nature, 
timing and extent of our audit procedures on the individual financial statement line items and disclosures and in evaluating 
the effect of misstatements, both individually and in aggregate on the financial statements as a whole. 
Based on our professional judgement, we determined materiality for the financial statements as a whole as follows:
Group financial statements Parent company financial statements
Overall materiality £1,650,000 £1,567,500 
How we determined it 5% of profit before tax. 1% of total assets (capped at 95% of group 
materiality).
Rationale for  
benchmark applied
The key objective of the group is to deliver 
profitable growth to increase long-term 
shareholder value. As a result, we believe 
profit before tax is the primary measure 
used by the shareholders in assessing the 
performance of the group and is therefore 
the appropriate benchmark to use in setting 
materiality.
The key objective of the parent company 
is to hold investments in the various group 
companies. As a result, we believe total 
assets is the primary measure used by the 
shareholders in assessing the performance 
of the parent company and is therefore the 
appropriate benchmark to use in setting 
materiality.
For each component in the scope of our group audit, we allocated a materiality that is less than our overall group 
materiality. The range of materiality allocated across components was between £73,000 and £1,567,500. Certain components 
were audited to a local statutory audit materiality that was also less than our overall group materiality.
We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to them misstatements identified during our audit above £82,500 
(group audit) and £78,300 (Parent company audit) as well as misstatements below those amounts that, in our view, warranted 
reporting for qualitative reasons. 80 MJ Gleeson plc: Report and Accounts for the year ended 30 June 2017
Going concern
In accordance with ISAs (UK) we report as follows:
Reporting obligation Outcome
We are required to report if we have anything material 
to add or draw attention to in respect of the directors’ 
statement in the financial statements about whether the 
directors considered it appropriate to adopt the going 
concern basis of accounting in preparing the financial 
statements and the directors’ identification of any material 
uncertainties to the group’s and the parent company’s 
ability to continue as a going concern over a period of 
at least twelve months from the date of approval of the 
financial statements.
We have nothing material to add or to draw attention to. 
However, because not all future events or conditions can 
be predicted, this statement is not a guarantee as to the 
group’s and parent company’s ability to continue as a going 
concern.
We are required to report if the directors’ statement 
relating to Going Concern in accordance with Listing Rule 
9.8.6R(3) is materially inconsistent with our knowledge 
obtained in the audit.
We have nothing to report.
REPORTING ON OTHER INFORMATION 
The other information comprises all of the information in the Report and Accounts other than the financial statements and 
our auditors’ report thereon. The directors are responsible for the other information. Our opinion on the financial statements 
does not cover the other information and, accordingly, we do not express an audit opinion or, except to the extent otherwise 
explicitly stated in this report, any form of assurance thereon. 
In connection with our audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, 
consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained 
in the audit, or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If we identify an apparent material inconsistency or material 
misstatement, we are required to perform procedures to conclude whether there is a material misstatement of the financial 
statements or a material misstatement of the other information. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that 
there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report 
based on these responsibilities.
With respect to the Strategic Report and Directors’ Report, we also considered whether the disclosures required by the UK 
Companies Act 2006 have been included. 
Based on the responsibilities described above and our work undertaken in the course of the audit, the Companies Act 2006, 
(CA06), ISAs (UK) and the Listing Rules of the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) require us also to report certain opinions and 
matters as described below (required by ISAs (UK) unless otherwise stated).
Strategic Report and Directors’ Report
In our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of the audit, the information given in the Strategic Report and 
Directors’ Report for the year ended 30 June 2017 is consistent with the financial statements and has been prepared in 
accordance with applicable legal requirements. (CA06)
In light of the knowledge and understanding of the group and parent company and their environment obtained in the 
course of the audit, we did not identify any material misstatements in the Strategic Report and Directors’ Report. (CA06)

The directors’ assessment of the prospects of the group and of the principal risks that would threaten the solvency or 
liquidity of the group
We have nothing material to add or draw attention to regarding:
• The directors’ confirmation on page 43 of the Annual Report that they have carried out a robust assessment of the 
principal risks facing the group, including those that would threaten its business model, future performance, solvency 
or liquidity.
• The disclosures in the Annual Report that describe those risks and explain how they are being managed or mitigated.
• The directors’ explanation on page 45 of the Annual Report as to how they have assessed the prospects of the group, 
over what period they have done so and why they consider that period to be appropriate, and their statement as 
to whether they have a reasonable expectation that the group will be able to continue in operation and meet its 
liabilities as they fall due over the period of their assessment, including any related disclosures drawing attention to 
any necessary qualifications or assumptions.
We have nothing to report having performed a review of the directors’ statement that they have carried out a robust 
assessment of the principal risks facing the group and statement in relation to the longer-term viability of the group. Our 
review was substantially less in scope than an audit and only consisted of making inquiries and considering the directors’ 
process supporting their statements; checking that the statements are in alignment with the relevant provisions of the UK 
Corporate Governance Code (the “Code”); and considering whether the statements are consistent with the knowledge and 
understanding of the group and parent company and their environment obtained in the course of the audit. (Listing Rules).
Other Code Provisions
We have nothing to report in respect of our responsibility to report when: 
• The statement given by the directors, on page 76, that they consider the Annual Report taken as a whole to be fair, 
balanced and understandable, and provides the information necessary for the members to assess the group’s and 
parent company’s position and performance, business model and strategy is materially inconsistent with our knowledge 
of the group and parent company obtained in the course of performing our audit.
• The section of the Annual Report on page 52 describing the work of the Audit Committee does not appropriately 
address matters communicated by us to the Audit Committee.
• The directors’ statement relating to the parent company’s compliance with the Code does not properly disclose a 
departure from a relevant provision of the Code specified, under the Listing Rules, for review by the auditors.
Directors’ Remuneration
In our opinion, the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited has been properly prepared in accordance 
with the Companies Act 2006. (CA06).
RESPONSIBILITIES FOR THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND THE AUDIT
Responsibilities of the directors for the financial statements
As explained more fully in the Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities set out on page 76, the directors are responsible for 
the preparation of the financial statements in accordance with the applicable framework and for being satisfied that they 
give a true and fair view. The directors are also responsible for such internal control as they determine is necessary to enable 
the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error .
In preparing the financial statements, the directors are responsible for assessing the group’s and the parent company’s ability 
to continue as a going concern, disclosing as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis 
of accounting unless the directors either intend to liquidate the group or the parent company or to cease operations, or have 
no realistic alternative but to do so. 82 MJ Gleeson plc: Report and Accounts for the year ended 30 June 2017
Auditors’ responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material 
misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditors’ report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance 
is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs (UK) will always detect a 
material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually 
or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of 
these financial statements. 
A further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements is located on the FRC’s website at:  
www.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities. This description forms part of our auditors’ report.
Use of this report
This report, including the opinions, has been prepared for and only for the parent company’s members as a body in 
accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006 and for no other purpose. We do not, in giving these 
opinions, accept or assume responsibility for any other purpose or to any other person to whom this report is shown or into 
whose hands it may come save where expressly agreed by our prior consent in writing.
Other required reporting
COMPANIES ACT 2006 EXCEPTION REPORTING
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if, in our opinion:
• we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit; or
• adequate accounting records have not been kept by the parent company, or returns adequate for our audit have not 
been received from branches not visited by us; or
• certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration specified by law are not made; or
• the parent company financial statements and the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited are not in 
agreement with the accounting records and returns. 
We have no exceptions to report arising from this responsibility. 
APPOINTMENT
Following the recommendation of the audit committee, we were appointed by the directors on 14 November 2016 to audit 
the financial statements for the year ended 30 June 2017 and subsequent financial periods. This is therefore our first year of 
uninterrupted engagement.

The maintenance and integrity of the MJ Gleeson plc website is the responsibility of the directors; the work carried out by 
the auditors does not involve consideration of these matters and, accordingly, the auditors accept no responsibility for any 
changes that may have occurred to the financial statements since they were initially presented on the website.
Legislation in the United Kingdom governing the preparation and dissemination of financial statements may differ from 
legislation in other jurisdictions.

Notes to the Financial Statements
for the year ended 30 June 2017
1 Accounting policies
MJ Gleeson plc (the “Company”) is a public limited company which is listed on the London Stock Exchange and is incorporated and 
domiciled in the United Kingdom. The address of the registered office is 6 Europa Court, Sheffield Business Park, Sheffield, S9 1XE.
Basis of preparation
The consolidated financial statements of the Company and the Group have been prepared in accordance with International Financial 
Reporting Standards (IFRS) and IFRS Interpretations Committee (IFRS IC) interpretations as adopted by the European Union and the 
Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS.
The principal accounting policies set out below have been applied consistently to all periods presented in these financial statements. 
Assets and liabilities in the financial statements have been valued at historic cost except where otherwise indicated in these 
accounting policies. 
The Company has taken advantage of section 408 of the Companies Act 2006 and consequently a statement of comprehensive 
income of the parent company is not presented as part of these financial statements. 
Basis of consolidation
The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the Company and all of its subsidiary undertakings 
(together referred to as the “Group”). Joint ventures are accounted for using the equity method of accounting.
Going concern
The Directors have, at the time of approving the financial statements, a reasonable expectation that the Company and the Group 
have adequate resources to continue in operational existence for at least twelve months from the date of the financial statements. 
Thus they continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing the financial statements.
Subsidiaries
Subsidiaries are entities controlled by the Group. Control exists when the Group has the power , directly or indirectly, to govern the 
financial and operating policies of an entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities. In assessing control, potential voting rights 
that are currently exercisable or convertible are taken into account. The financial statements of subsidiaries are included in the 
consolidated financial statements from the date that control commences until the date that control ceases.
On acquisition, the assets and liabilities and contingent liabilities of a subsidiary are measured at their fair value. Any excess of 
the fair value of consideration given for the acquisition over the fair values of the identifiable net assets acquired is recognised 
as goodwill. In circumstances where the fair values of the identifiable net assets exceed the cost of acquisition, the excess is 
immediately recognised in the consolidated income statement. Acquisition related costs are expensed as incurred.
Revenue recognition
Revenue represents the fair value of work done on contracts performed during the year on behalf of customers or the value of 
goods and services delivered to customers. Revenue is recognised as follows:
• Revenue from homes sales is recognised when contracts to sell are completed and title has passed.
• Revenue from property and land sales is recognised at the earlier of when contracts to sell are completed and title has passed 
or when unconditional contracts to sell are exchanged. 
Appropriate provision against claims from customers or third parties is made in the year in which the Group becomes aware that 
a claim may arise. 
Segment reporting
An operating segment is a component of the Group that engages in business activities from which it may earn revenues and incur 
expenses, including revenues and expenses that relate to transactions with any of the Group’s other components, and for which 
discrete financial information is available. All operating segments’ operating results are reviewed regularly by the Executive 
Directors to make decisions about resources to be allocated to the segment and to assess its performance. Segment results, 
assets and liabilities include items directly attributable to a segment as well as those that can be allocated on a reasonable basis. 
Segment capital expenditure is the total cost incurred during the period to acquire plant and equipment.

Impairment: Financial assets
A financial asset not carried at fair value through profit or loss is assessed at each reporting date to determine whether there is 
objective evidence that it is impaired. A financial asset is impaired if objective evidence indicates that a loss event has occurred 
after the initial recognition of the asset, and that the loss event had a negative effect on the estimated future cash flows of that 
asset that can be estimated reliably. 
Impairment losses recognised in prior periods are assessed at each reporting date for any indications that the loss has decreased 
or no longer exists. An impairment loss is reversed if there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the recoverable 
amount. An impairment loss is reversed only to the extent that the asset’s carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount 
that would have been determined if no impairment loss had been recognised. 
Impairment: Non-financial assets 
The carrying amounts of the Group’s non-financial assets are reviewed at each reporting date to determine whether there is any 
indication of impairment. If any such indication exists, then the asset’s recoverable amount is estimated. 
The recoverable amount of an asset is the greater of its value in use and its fair value less costs to sell. In assessing value in use, 
the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market 
assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset. 
An impairment loss is recognised if the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated recoverable amount. Impairment losses 
are recognised in the consolidated income statement.
Impairment losses recognised in prior periods are assessed at each reporting date for any indications that the loss has decreased 
or no longer exists. An impairment loss is reversed if there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the recoverable 
amount. An impairment loss is reversed only to the extent that the asset’s carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount 
that would have been determined if no impairment loss had been recognised. 
Financial income and expenses 
Finance income comprises interest income on funds invested, dividend income and the unwinding of discounts on deferred receipts. 
Interest income is recognised as it accrues, using the effective interest method. Dividend income is recognised in the consolidated 
income statement on the date that the Group’s right to receive payment is established. 
Finance expenses comprise interest expense on borrowings and unwinding of the discount on deferred payments and provisions. All 
borrowing costs are recognised in the consolidated income statement using the effective interest method.
Plant and equipment
Plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and any recognised impairment loss. Depreciation is charged 
so as to write off the cost of assets over their estimated useful lives, using the straight-line method, on the following basis:
Plant and equipment:                        between 3 and 6 years
Depreciation of these assets is charged to the consolidated income statement.
Leasing
Leases in which a significant portion of the risks and rewards of ownership are retained by the lessor are classified as operating 
leases. Payments made under operating leases (net of any incentives received from the lessor) are charged to the consolidated 
income statement on a straight-line basis over the period of the lease.
Joint ventures 
A joint venture is an entity over which the Group is in a position to exercise joint control through participation in the financial 
and operating policy decisions of the venture. The joint venture entity operates in the same way as other enterprises, except 
that a contractual arrangement between the venturers establishes joint control over the economic activity of the entity. Joint 
ventures are accounted for using the equity method of accounting. The Group’s share of the results of joint ventures is reported in 
the consolidated income statement as part of the operating profit and the net investment disclosed in the statement of financial 
position. 
Strategic Report Governance Report Financial Statements Further Information 92 MJ Gleeson plc: Report and Accounts for the year ended 30 June 2017
Investments
Investments are stated at cost less impairment. Cost is adjusted to reflect changes in consideration arising from contingent 
consideration amendments.
Investment properties
Investment properties, which are ground rent properties held to earn rentals and/or for capital appreciation, are stated at fair 
value. Gains or losses arising from changes in the fair values of investment properties are included in the consolidated income 
statement in the period in which they arise.
Inventories
Inventories are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value and are subject to regular impairment reviews. Inventories 
comprise all direct costs incurred in bringing the individual inventories to their present state at the reporting date, including direct 
materials, direct labour costs and related overheads, less the value of any impairment losses.
Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business less the estimated costs of completion and 
the estimated costs necessary to make the sale. Deferred land purchases are included in inventories at their net present values at 
original purchase date. 
Available for sale financial assets
Available for sale financial assets due after more than one year, which represent receivables in respect of shared equity properties, 
are recorded at fair value, being the amount receivable by the Group discounted to present day values. The difference between the 
amount receivable by the Group and the initial fair value is credited over the deferred term to finance income, with the financial 
asset increasing to its full cash settlement value on the anticipated receipt date. Credit risk is accounted for in determining 
fair values and appropriate discount factors are applied. The Group holds a second charge over property sold under shared 
equity schemes. Changes in the fair value of available for sale financial assets are recognised in other comprehensive income. 
Interest calculated using the effective interest method, dividends, and impairment losses on available for sale financial assets are 
recognised in the consolidated income statement.
Trade receivables
Trade receivables are measured at initial recognition at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective 
interest method, less provision for impairment.
Appropriate allowances for estimated irrecoverable amounts are recognised in the consolidated income statement when there 
is objective evidence that the asset is impaired. The allowance recognised is measured as the difference between the asset’s 
carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows discounted at the effective interest rate computed at initial 
recognition.
Cash and cash equivalents 
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash on hand, demand deposits, other short-term highly liquid investments that are readily 
convertible to a known amount of cash and are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value. 
Discontinued operations
A discontinued operation is a component of the Group’s business that represents a separate major line of business or geographical 
area of operations or is a subsidiary acquired exclusively with a view to resale, that has been disposed of or has been abandoned.
Discontinued operations are presented in the consolidated income statement (including the comparative period) as a single line 
entry recording the gain or loss of the discontinued operation and the gain or loss recognised on the remeasurement to fair value 
less costs to sell. If the discontinued operations are sold, the net gain or loss from the sale is also recognised in the single line entry.
Loans and borrowings
Loans and borrowings are initially measured at cost and are subsequently reviewed to ascertain whether a fair value adjustment 
is required.
Notes to the Financial Statements (continued)
Strategic Report Governance Report Financial Statements Further Information MJ Gleeson plc: Report and Accounts for the year ended 30 June 2017 93
Trade and other payables
Trade and other payables are initially measured at fair value and are subsequently measured at amortised cost, using the effective 
interest rate method.
Tax
Tax on the profit or loss for the year comprises current and deferred tax. Tax is recognised in the consolidated income statement 
except to the extent that it relates to items recognised directly in equity, in which case it is recognised in equity.
Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year , using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the 
balance sheet date, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years.
Deferred tax is provided on temporary differences between the carrying values of assets and liabilities for financial reporting 
purposes and the values used for taxation purposes. The following temporary differences are not provided for: the initial 
recognition of goodwill; the initial recognition of assets or liabilities that affect neither accounting nor taxable profit other than 
in a business combination; and differences relating to investments in subsidiaries to the extent that they will probably not reverse 
in the foreseeable future and the Group can control the timing of the reversal. The amount of deferred tax provided is based 
on the expected manner of realisation or settlement of the carrying amount of assets and liabilities, using tax rates enacted or 
substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which 
the asset can be utilised.
Employee benefits
Defined contribution pension plans 
Obligations for contributions to defined contribution pension schemes are charged to the consolidated income statement in the 
period to which the contributions relate. 
Share options 
Share option schemes allow employees to acquire shares in the ultimate parent company. The fair value of options granted 
is recognised as an employee expense, with a corresponding increase in equity. The fair value is measured at grant date and 
spread over the period during which the employees become unconditionally entitled to the options. The fair value of the options 
granted is measured using generally accepted option pricing models, taking into account the terms and conditions upon which 
the options were granted. The amount recognised as an expense is adjusted to reflect the actual number of share options that 
vest, except where forfeiture is due only to share prices not achieving the threshold for vesting. These awards are granted by the 
ultimate parent company and the cost of the share-based award relating to each subsidiary is calculated, based on an appropriate 
apportionment, at the date of grant and recharged through intercompany. 
Own shares held by Employee Benefit Trusts
The Group has elected to treat the Employee Benefit Trusts (“EBT”) as separate legal entities and as subsidiaries of the parent. Any 
loan made to the EBT is accounted for as an intercompany loan with the parent. These shares are not treasury shares as defined 
by the London Stock Exchange.
Dividends
Dividends are recorded in the Group’s financial statements when paid. Final dividends are recorded in the Group’s financial 
statements in the period in which they receive shareholder approval.
Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires management to make judgements, estimates and 
assumptions that affect the application of policies and reported amounts of assets and liabilities, income and expenses. The 
estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be 
reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis of making the judgements about carrying values of assets 
and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates. The estimates and 
underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which 
the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period, or in the period of the revision and future periods if the revision 
affects both current and future periods.
Strategic Report Governance Report Financial Statements Further Information 94 MJ Gleeson plc: Report and Accounts for the year ended 30 June 2017
The key judgement and sources of estimation uncertainty at the balance sheet date are:
Inventories (land and work in progress)
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. The assessment of net realisable value is performed on a 
site-by-site basis taking into account an estimation of costs to complete and remaining revenues. These are carried out at regular 
intervals throughout the year , during which site development costs are allocated between units built in the current year and those 
to be built in future years. These assessments include a degree of inherent uncertainty when estimating the profitability of a site 
and in assessing any impairment provisions which may be required.
Available for sale financial assets (shared equity)
The valuation of the available for sale financial assets is made in the light of current market conditions, expected house price 
inflation, cost of money and the expected time to realisation of the assets and is therefore subject to a degree of inherent 
uncertainty.
Deferred tax
Deferred tax is only recognised on tax losses when it is probable the losses will be utilised in full in future years. The judgement to 
recognise the deferred tax asset is dependent upon taxable profits arising in the same company as the losses originally arose and 
the Group’s expectations regarding future profitability including site revenue and cost forecasts for future years which contain a 
degree of inherent uncertainty.
Adoption of new and revised standards
For the year ended 30 June 2017, the Group has applied the following new and revised standards that were mandatorily effective 
for an accounting period beginning on or after 1 January 2016. Their adoption has not had any material impact on the disclosures 
or the amounts reported in these financial statements.
IAS 1 (Amended)  ‘Presentation of financial statements’
IAS 16 (Amended)  ‘Property, plant and equipment’
IAS 27 (Amended)  ‘Separate financial statements’
IAS 38 (Amended)  ‘Intangible assets’
IFRS 11 (Amended)  ‘Accounting for acquisitions of interests in joint operations’
Annual improvements Issued 2012 - 2014
Standards not yet applied
There are a number of standards and interpretations issued by the International Accounting Standards Board that are effective for 
financial statements after this reporting period. The following have not been adopted by the Company in preparing the financial 
statements for the year ended 30 June 2017:
Standard  Effective for periods
IAS 7 (Amended)  ‘Statement on cash flows’ (issued February 2016)* 1 January 2017
IAS 12 (Amended)  ‘Income Taxes’ (issued January 2016)*  1 January 2017
Annual improvements  Issued 2014 – 2016 1 January 2018
IFRS 2 (Amended)  ‘Share based payments (issued June 2016)* 1 January 2018
IFRS 9  ‘Financial Instruments’ (issued July 2014)  1 January 2018
IFRS 15  ‘Revenue from Contracts with Customers’ (issued May 2014) 1 January 2018
IFRS 15 (Amended)  ‘Revenue from Contracts with Customers’ (issued April 2016)* 1 January 2018
IFRS 16  ‘Leases’ (issued January 2016)*  1 January 2019
 
* not yet endorsed by the EU. 
 
IFRS 9 introduces new requirements on the classification and measurement of financial assets and liabilities. The full impact of 
the new Standard is currently being assessed but it will not have a material impact on the Group; the new Standard will require 
the available for sale reserve that is currently classified separately in equity to be reclassified and change the treatment of shared 
equity receivables held by the Group. There will be no impact on the Company as a result of the new Standard.
 
IFRS 15 sets out new revenue recognition criteria with particular regard to performance obligations and, whilst this may have an 
impact on the timing of revenue recognition of certain non-core revenue items, it will not materially impact the results of the 
Company and Group. If the new Standard was to be applied at the balance sheet date, it would have £nil impact on the results of 
the Group and the Company for the year.
Notes to the Financial Statements (continued)
Strategic Report Governance Report Financial Statements Further Information MJ Gleeson plc: Report and Accounts for the year ended 30 June 2017 95
IFRS 16 will introduce a ‘right-of-use asset’ and a lease liability representing future lease payments to the statement of financial 
position in respect of leases to which the Company and the Group is a party. This will not have a material net impact on the 
reported equity of the Company and the Group. If the new Standard was to be applied at the balance sheet date, the total assets 
of the Group would increase by £2.1m and total liabilities would increase by £2.2m. Consequently, the net impact would be a 
decrease in net assets of £0.1m. There would be £nil impact on the Company’s statement of financial position. There will be no 
impact on cash flows of the Group and the Company as a result of the new Standard. 
 
Enhanced disclosures will be required for both IFRS 15 and IFRS 16 and these will be included in the relevant financial statements 
to which the Standards are effective.  
 
The application of the remaining standards and interpretations not yet applied is not expected to have a material impact on the 
Company and Group’s financial performance or position, or give rise to additional disclosures in the financial statements.

See note 18 for reference to credit risk associated with trade receivables and further disclosures in respect of available for sale 
financial assets.        
        
Amounts due from subsidiary undertakings are unsecured, repayable on demand, and incur interest of 0% to 1% plus Bank of England 
base rate.             
18 Financial instruments
Risk exposure
The Company operates a central treasury function providing services to the Group. The treasury function arranges loans and 
funding, invests any surplus liquidity and manages financial risk. The treasury function is not a profit centre and no speculative 
trades are permitted or executed. It operates within specific policies, agreed by the Board, to control and monitor financial risk 
within the Group. Prudent and controlled use of financial instruments is permitted where appropriate, principally to reduce 
fluctuation in interest costs.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprises cash and short-term deposits with a maturity of three months or less held by the Group and 
the Company. The carrying amount of these assets equals their fair value.
Credit risk
The Group’s principal financial assets are trade and other receivables and investments.
The Group’s and Company’s credit risk is primarily attributable to its trade and other receivables. The amounts presented in the 
consolidated statement of financial position are net of allowance for doubtful debts, estimated by the Group’s management based 
on prior experience and their assessment of specific circumstances.
The credit risk on liquid funds is limited because the counterparties are banks with high credit ratings assigned by international 
credit rating agencies.
At 30 June 2017, the Group’s most significant credit risk was to a listed housebuilder and amounted to £11,186,000 (2016: 
£4,550,000) of the trade and other receivables carrying amount, with the deferred receivables secured by way of first legal charge 
over the land. The Group’s remaining credit risk is spread over a number of counterparties and customers.

All trade receivables are from UK customers.        
Trade receivables past due more than one year are largely retentions within the Gleeson Homes division. The amounts due are 
being finalised and are included at expected realisable value.       
Included in trade receivables not past due are £8,758,000 (2016: £6,916,000) receivables due in more than one year.  
In addition to the above, the Company has intercompany receivables which are repayable on demand.

Market risk
The Group has no significant exposure to currency risk or equity risk.
Interest rate risk
The Group closely monitors its exposure to variations in interest rates and, if this is significant as a result of the quantum of debt 
and level of interest rates, will hedge the exposure using approved financial instruments such as interest rate swaps. At the year 
end, the Group had no debt or related interest rate swaps. 
A 1% increase in interest rates would improve the annual income of the Group and Company by £340,000 (2016: £232,000) based 
on the cash balance at the year end. A 1% decrease would cause income to fall by the same amount.

Balance at 30 June 5,669 6,611 
Strategic Report Governance Report Financial Statements Further Information 108 MJ Gleeson plc: Report and Accounts for the year ended 30 June 2017
Available for sale financial assets represent shared equity loans advanced to customers and secured by way of a second charge on 
the property sold. They are carried at fair value which is determined by discounting forecast cash flows for the residual period of 
the contract. The difference between the nominal value and the initial fair value is credited over the deferred term to finance 
income, with the financial asset increasing to its full cash settlement value on the anticipated receipt date.    
        
Redemptions in the year of shared equity loans carried at £902,000 (2016: £853,000) generated a profit on redemption of £216,000 
(2016: £73,000) which has been recognised in other operating income in the consolidated income statement. In the prior year, the 
profit on redemption of shared equity loans was recognised in cost of sales.       
       
In addition, a net change in the value of available for sale financial assets of £104,000 has been recognised in other comprehensive 
income. This is made up as follows:         
Group
2017
£000

£000
Fair value movement recognised in other comprehensive income (140) (584)
Fair value recycled through profit and loss 36 -  
Total movement recognised in other comprehensive income (104) (584)
Forecast cash flows are determined using inputs based on current market conditions and the Group’s historic experience of actual 
cash flows resulting from such arrangements. These inputs are by nature estimates and as such the fair value has been classified 
as Level 3 under the fair value hierarchy laid out in IFRS 13 ‘Fair Value Measurement’. There have been no transfers between fair 
value levels in the financial year.         
         
Significant unobservable inputs into the fair value measurement calculation include regional house price movements based on 
the Group’s actual experience of regional house pricing and management forecasts of future movements, the anticipated period 
to redemption of loans which remain outstanding and a discount rate based on current observed market interest rates offered to 
private individuals on secured second loans.          
        
The key assumptions applied in calculating fair value as at the balance sheet date were:     
• Forecast regional house price inflation: 2.0% - 3.5%
• Average period to redemption: 5.5yrs
• Discount rate: 8%         
         
The sensitivity analysis of changes to each of the key assumptions applied in calculating fair value, whilst holding all other 
assumptions constant, is as follows: 
Change in assumption
Increase/ 
(decrease)
in fair value
£000
Forecast regional house price inflation – increase by 1% 302 
Average period to redemption – increase by 1 year (295)
Discount rate – decrease by 1% 289

Deferred tax assets 5,001  4,567 
 5,001  4,567 
Reductions in the UK corporation tax rate, to 19% with effect from 1 April 2017 and to 17% with effect from 1 April 2020, 
were substantively enacted into law before the balance sheet date. In the opinion of the Directors, some timing differences are 
expected to reverse prior to 1 April 2020, and some after 1 April 2020. Therefore the deferred tax has been provided at a mixed 
rate of 19% and 17% for relevant timing differences on a company by company basis to arrive at the consolidated position. If all of 
the deferred tax balances were restated at a rate of 17% rather than 19%, the total deferred tax asset would reduce by £465,000 
to £4,536,000.     
     
At the balance sheet date, the Group has gross tax losses of £26,674,000 (2016: £28,310,000) of which £17,808,000 (2016: 
£20,133,000) have been recognised as a deferred tax asset. The Group has unrecognised tax losses of £8,866,000 (2016: £8,177,000) 
available for offset against future profits. Losses may be carried forward indefinitely against future taxable trading profits.

The Company had no minimum lease payments under non-cancellable operating leases.      
 
Land and building lease terms vary between one to ten years, depending on market conditions.     
  
Where possible, the Group always endeavours to sub-lease any vacant space on short-term lets. An onerous lease provision is 
recognised where the rents receivable over the lease term are less than the obligation to the head lessor.     
   
In the current year, onerous lease provisions of £10,000 were utilised (2016: £62,000). See note 20 for details.

The Company has one class of ordinary share which carries no rights to fixed income. All issued shares are fully paid. 
The number of Ordinary shares of 2p in issue as at 30 June 2017 was 54,120,495 (2016: 54,120,495).  
At 30 June 2017, the Employee Benefit Trusts (“EBT”) held 50,000 (2016: 60,000) shares at a value of £308,000 (2016: £251,000) 
which have not yet vested unconditionally. The shares are held in the EBT for the purpose of satisfying options that have been 
granted under the employee share ownership plans. Of these ordinary shares, the right to dividend has been waived on none of 
these shares (2016: nil).     
All shares issued during the prior year were the result of share options being exercised; details of share options are given in note 27.
27 Share-based payments          
During the year to 30 June 2017, the Group had five share-based payment arrangements in operation. The recognition and 
measurement principles in IFRS 2 have not been applied to those options granted before 7 November 2002 in accordance with the 
transitional provisions in IFRS 1 and IFRS 2.         
         
Following the implementation of the Scheme of Arrangement (the “Scheme”) on 18 December 2014, all share based payment 
arrangements in place at that time in respect of the shares of MJ Gleeson Group plc were replaced on a one for one basis with 
shares in MJ Gleeson plc. It is the intention of the directors that awards under the MJ Gleeson Group plc employee share plans will 
not vest early as a result of the Scheme but will continue on the same basis under the MJ Gleeson plc employee share plans, other 
than they will ultimately deliver MJ Gleeson plc shares rather than MJ Gleeson Group plc shares.

Share options granted after 7 November 2002
Fair value is used to measure the value of the outstanding options. 
Share purchase plan
The fair value of each share granted in the share purchase plan is equal to the share price at the date of the grant. Shares are 
granted on a monthly basis.
Performance share plan
The fair value per option for the performance share plan scheme has been calculated using a modified Monte Carlo model. The 
inputs into the model at each grant date and the estimated fair value were as follows:

• Fair value of one option £1.44 £2.37 £3.15 £2.95
* Awards made under the December 2016 PSP allow, on vesting, for an additional award of shares to be made to the option holder 
equivalent to the dividends paid over the vesting period on the underlying shares. 
Expected volatility was determined by calculating the historical volatility of the Company’s share price; volatility was measured 
over the previous 3 years.
