ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS  
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2017
01 Our Business 
The Group has performed well against our strategic milestones for 
the year. The acquisition of CellRight Technologies is a transformative 
opportunity for the Group, combining two innovative, regenerative 
platforms with large addressable markets and synergistic growth 
opportunities. With the appointment of Steve Couldwell as CEO, 
the Board is confident that it has the leadership in place to take 
the Company to the next stage and a comprehensive review of the 
development pipeline is ongoing. With our augmented, established 
product portfolio generating a growing level of sales, we have 
identified key development assets to focus our commercial resources 
behind, and we are confident that following final product validation 
and transfer of manufacturing in-house, the newly focused strategy 
will drive significant shareholder returns. 
Financial Performance 
Overall Group performance 
The Group delivered revenues of £5,233K in the 12 months to 
31 December 2017, a 263% increase when compared to the 
11 month period to December 2016. 
Organic DermaPure
®
 sales grew 46% in the US to £1,932K, and 
the commercial traction of the European controlled joint venture 
continued with increased revenues to £1,135K. 
Following the equity fundraising undertaken in August 2017, the 
Group has a robust cash position to fund the near term future of the 
enlarged Group and we maintain our expectation that the Group will 
be cash break-even during 2020. 
Leadership 
In November 2017, we announced the appointment of Steve 
Couldwell as CEO of the Group. Steve succeeds Antony Odell who 
stepped down in October 2017 after nine years leading the Group. 
We would like to thank Antony for his leadership during the Group’s 
early years.
Steve has experience spanning over 25 years in the Medical 
Device space and a proven track record of delivering revenue and 
profit growth. He has had an extensive career including Smith & 
Nephew and more recently, Sanofi BioSurgery based in Boston, 
Massachusetts. Having held senior commercial positions in both 
the US and Europe, Steve has the necessary skill set to drive the 
next stages of the Group’s commercial strategy required to deliver 
shareholder returns. 
Following the resignation of Paul Devlin on 30 November, we  
have appointed an  interim CFO and initiated a search for a 
permanent candidate. 
Our People 
The Board and I would like to extend our thanks to our employees 
and partners, especially throughout this year of significant change. 
With the integration of CellRight Technologies, we welcomed a new 
team in the US, led by CEO Jesus Hernandez, and the addition of 
their experience and the ongoing commitment of all our employees

Who are CellRight Technologies?   
With the demand for less invasive, longer 
lasting treatment modalities, regenerative 
medicine is an increasingly important 
approach as it removes the need for 
synthetic (plastic or metal) replacements, and 
reduces the risk of rejection, while offering the 
potential for less time-consuming and more 
cost-effective treatments. 
Tissue Regenix patented dCELL
®
 
Technology and CellRight’s proprietary 
BioRinse
®
 technology address unmet and 
growing clinical needs in the regenerative 
medicine market, due to increasing 
demographic demands and health 
economic pressures. 
The Health Benefits of 
Regenerative Medicine 
Regenerative medicine has been effective 
in multiple treatment areas, from skin and 
bone to even organ repair or replacement. 
Offering a solution with minimal risk of 
patient rejection, reducing the need 
for lifelong anticoagulation drugs and 
addressing the supply issue of suitable 
donated tissues, regenerative medicine has 
revolutionised the healthcare landscape. 
With the potential for decellularized 
xenografts, soft tissue sourced from an 
animal different to the recipient, most 
commonly either porcine (pig) or bovine 
(cows), the need to source grafts either 
from donation following death, or in some 
situations from the patient themselves, can 
be completely removed in certain cases. 
An example of this can be found in sports 
medicine. With an increasing percentage of 
the population living longer, the expectation 
to remain physically mobile and pain free 
has increased. Currently, the gold standard 
treatment for knee ligament repair is to 
extract a portion of the patient’s own 
hamstring, permanently reducing the strength 
of the muscle and leaving the patient with 
two surgical sites to rehabilitate. Products 
such as Tissue Regenix OrthoPure™ XT, 
a decellularised porcine tendon, remove 
the need to harvest the patient’s hamstring 
providing the surgeon with a room 
temperature, stable, off-the-shelf alternative 
proven to offer equivalent tensile strength, 
and due to the reduction of surgical sites, a 
simplified rehabilitation programme. 
What About  
Health Economics? 
With the increasing demand on both private 
payor and nationalised health care  
services, health economics is central to  
all procurement decisions especially  
when related to new technologies and 
surgical techniques. 
Adoption of new technologies will be 
dependent on delivering better patient 
outcomes while lowering the total treatment 
cost. Both of our platform technologies offer 
these benefits.

What is Regenerative Medicine?  dCELL
®
 Technology 
dCELL
®
 technology offers a unique approach to regenerative 
medicine. The dCELL
®
 process is gentle, efficient, effective – 
and powerful. It can be applied to both donated human tissues 
(allografts), or animal tissues (xenografts). It results in allograft 
and xenograft tissue matrices that retain the tissues’ native 
structure to allow repopulation and regeneration of the patient’s 
own tissue. 
The dCELL
®
 process removes DNA and cellular material from 
biological tissues, through a series of gentle washes, leaving 
an intact acellular matrix upon which the patient’s cells can 
populate and regenerate, creating new, native tissue, which is 
recognised and accepted by the body, significantly reducing 
the risk of rejection. dCELL
®
 technology provides an enhanced 
healing environment, in terms of both natural, tissue-specific 
physical structure and bio-mechanical properties. 
Tissue treated with dCELL
®
 technology gives the patient 
a receptive scaffold that supports cell migration following 
implantation, while maintaining appropriate tissue strength. 
Once repopulation is complete, the regenerated tissue is 
effectively a natural part of the patient’s own body. The potential 
applications of dCELL
®
 are diverse and currently Tissue Regenix 
is focusing on addressing complex and unmet needs in three 
core clinical areas: Orthopaedics, BioSurgery and Cardiac.
BioRinse Technology 
CellRight’s proprietary Technology, BioRinse, offers a novel 
regenerative solution creating verified osteoinductive scaffolds 
for the treatment of bone defects caused by trauma or disease. 
The BioRinse process transforms donated human bone into a 
mouldable matrix that preserves natural bone growth factors: 
Bone Morphogenic Proteins (“BMPs”) and Growth Factors 
(“GFs”), needed to regenerate healthy bone post implantation. 
It has the ability to deliver malleable bone collagen scaffolds in 
different physical forms to meet various clinical requirements.
The bone matrices and putties that CellRight has developed 
have distinctive active characteristics verifying them to be 
osteoinductive and, moreover, due to the BioRinse process, 
key CellRight products contain 100% allograft bone, which has 
been clinically proven to produce a better clinical outcome.

product portfolio was underpinned by a 
46% increase in DermaPure
®
 sales. With 
its first full year of sales, controlled joint 
venture GBM-V increased revenue by 8 
fold to £1.1m. The contribution of CellRight 
Technologies acquired on 9 August 2017, 
included in the year end figure means we 
have increased overall Group revenue to 
over £5m.
Alongside the acquisition of CellRight 
Technologies we have commenced a review 
of the enlarged Group’s product pipeline 
and opportunities to establish the best 
strategy to drive the Group forward.

 Technology 
TRX BioSurgery 
(previous Tissue Regenix Wound Care, Inc)
DermaPure
®
 has proven successful in a 
number of clinical applications outside 
of the traditional advanced wound care 
settings. With adoption by the acute surgical 
and wound reconstruction markets, due 
to its impressive clinical outcomes with a 
single application, DermaPure
®
 has seen 
significant uptake in the orthopaedic trauma 
and urogynaecology arenas where treatment 
innovation has been in high demand. 
Having identified an opportunity in this 
market, we have signed an exclusive 
distributor agreement with ARMS Medical, a 
specialist urogynaecology distributor in the 
United States to maximise this opportunity, 
leveraging their strong relationships with 
KOLs and surgeons. The partnership  
allows our direct sales force to remain 
focussed on the in-patient woundcare, 
plastics, orthopaedics and general surgery 
sales channels. 
Alongside this, the addition of CellRight’s 
advanced wound care products give the 
Group a wide product portfolio in this field, 
offering physicians access to DermaPure
®
, 
a room temperature stable, decellularized 
single application allograft, Matrix IQ, a frozen

 Orthopaedics 
Changes to Medical Device Regulations 
have extended the timeline to receive 
CE mark approval for OrthoPure™ XT 
(xenograft tendon) within the EU. However, 
this has resulted in the opportunity to submit 
an extension to this application to include 
other ligament indications accelerating the 
broadening of the commercial opportunity. 
Subject to approval, this would allow 
OrthoPure™ XT to be utilised not only in 
primary and revision ACL reconstruction, 
but also procedures in small ligaments in the 
knee, expanding utilisation and broadening 
our label claims. We have commenced 
pre-launch activities and have engaged 
European distributors in selective key 
markets to facilitate a timely roll-out once 
country registrations have been received.
The OrthoPure™ XT clinical data collected 
at one year showed the implant to be 
comparable, and in some indications 
preferable, to the current gold standard 
treatment, an autograft harvested from 
the hamstring, and without the additional 
rehabilitation of an autograft procedure. 
This clinical data has also been used to 
validate the potential for a pre-clinical trial 
in the US. As reported previously, we have 
been in discussions with the FDA and it 
is expected that this pre-clinical work will 
commence during 2018 with the support of 
our Orthopaedic Clinical Advisory Board. 
The technology transfer for the production 
of OrthoPure™ HT (allograft ligament), at 
the CellRight facility continues according 
to plan and we expect the first product 
to be available in H2 2018. As this is a 
human tissue derived application, it can be 
approved under the HCT/P pathway for 
minimally manipulated tissue thus expediting 
the time to market. This would serve as a 
pathfinder validating the dCELL
®
 Technology 
within the US Orthopaedic market.

Cardiac and GBM-V
The regulatory submission for CardioPure™ 
dCELL
®
 allograft pulmonary and aortic heart 
valves continues to progress through the 
German regulatory authorities. The clinical 
data generated by Dr Francisco da Costa, 
our clinician partner in Brazil, continues  
to demonstrate the clinical relevance  
and advantages of these transplants even  
after more than 10 years of follow-up. 
Subject to the regulatory process we 
anticipate that approval will be received  
for launch during 2019. 
In addition to the preparation and 
commercialisation of CardioPure™, the 
controlled joint venture in Germany has 
captured a 12%

 market share in its first 
year of operations with processed corneas. 
We expect to release further cryo-preserved 
tissues throughout the year.

Orthopaedics and Dental -
CellRight Technologies
CellRight Technologies officially became  
a part of the Tissue Regenix Group in 
August 2017. 
Based around a proprietary processing 
technology ‘BioRinse
®
’, CellRight 
produces a portfolio of inductive, verified 
bone matrices in different physical forms 
to address clinical indications in the 
orthopaedic, spine, dental and general 
surgery procedures. 
BioRinse
®
 offers a complementary platform 
Technology to dCELL
®
, allowing the Group 
to address regenerative solutions for both 
soft tissue and bone. 
DentalFix
®
, a portfolio of traditional as well 
as innovative dental biologics validated as 
being osteoinductive, was launched. The 
dental market is an area in which we see a 
significant opportunity for the Group with 
both dCELL
®
 and BioRinse
®
 products, 
and currently comprises around 20% of 
CellRight sales. 
CellRight has reached several milestones 
since the completion of the acquisition. In 
October they commenced the production 
of AmnioWorks
®
, an advanced wound 
care product derived from human amniotic 
membrane. Alongside this, additional sizes 
of their frozen and freeze dried wound care 
product Matrix IQ were released to address 
larger surgical site procedures. 
With no direct sales force, CellRight based 
their business model around establishing 
strategic partnerships for distribution of 
both their white label (OEM) as well as 
branded products. These partnerships have 
continued to gain traction and we expect 
to see further partnerships develop in the 
coming year.
CellRight delivered on their revenue 
expectations during 2017 and we continue 
to see increasing commercial traction and 
momentum. We expect to report positive 
advances with the CellRight portfolio  
during 2018.

SEE PAGE 15
Integration
The integration process has continued to 
progress according to plan and we expect 
the initial commercial and financial synergies 
to materialise in H1 2018.
The technology transfer for DermaPure
®
 
production has been initiated. The 
completion of residual DNA testing returned 
positive results, demonstrating over 99% 
removal of DNA from the tissue. We expect 
that this process will complete ahead of 
schedule with our first CellRight-processed 
DermaPure
®
 becoming available during H1 
2018. Having our own in-house source of 
DermaPure
®
 manufactured in the US, for 
the US market, will support supply from our 
relationship with CTS, removing the risk of 
single sourcing and ensuring that our product 
inventory can align with customer demand.
In October, the Tissue Regenix Wound Care 
office, also based in San Antonio, TX, moved 
into the CellRight facility, allowing all US 
operations to be centralised in one location. 
A shared services infrastructure has been 
implemented and the advantages of a cross-
selling distribution and partnership network 
are beginning to be realised.

08 Post Period Developments 
Following the reported period, the Group 
reached a number of regulatory and 
commercial milestones which will play an 
important part in the strategy and commercial 
success of the Group moving forward. 
Fundamental to this was the announcement 
of a long-term, multi-year distribution 
agreement with Arthrex, Inc. for CellRight’s 
osteobiologic products. Arthrex is one of the 
world’s leading sports medicine businesses 
and a premier innovator of orthopaedic 
surgical solutions. This is the first agreement 
of this nature to be signed since completing 
the acquisition and paves the way for the 
Group to pursue relationships with other 
strategic partners. 
In order to expedite a route to market in 
Europe for the CellRight products Tissue 
Regenix applied for a Human Tissue 
Authority licence and we expect this to 
be granted imminently, allowing for the 
import of CellRight’s osteobiologics to the 
manufacturing facility in Leeds for direct 
distribution. It is expected that the first  
sales under this approval will commence 
in H2 2018.
Further to this, initial manufacturing for 
commercial distribution of SurgiPure
™
 XD 
has begun at the Leeds facility for export 
to the US where it is approved under the 
510(k) market clearance pathway. We are 
in discussions with potential partners to 
determine the optimal route to market. 
Outlook
The Group has reached a significant 
inflection point in terms of its development 
as a commercial entity. Having successfully 
completed the acquisition and integration 
of CellRight Technologies we now have 
two complementary and highly valuable 
regenerative technology platforms and  
a comprehensive product portfolio.  
Looking forward, we have a diverse 
distribution network, a strengthened 
commercial management team and 
significant opportunities to increase our 
commercial footprint both in the US, and 
international markets.
The Group is well positioned for future 
growth with a clearly defined strategy, strong 
leadership and a robust product portfolio 
and pipeline. The CellRight acquisition 
allows for acceleration of our route to 
market specifically for the dCELL
®
 business, 
and offers an enhanced product portfolio, 
which strengthens our ability to increase 
our market adoption and penetration. 
This was demonstrated during Q1 2018 
where we announced strategic distribution 
agreements with ARMS Medical, a specialist 
urogynaecology distributor for DermaPure
®
, 
and Arthrex, Inc. a world leader in 
orthopaedic sports medicine. 
We are grateful for the continued support 
of our shareholders throughout the year. 
Their commitment enables us to continue 
to advance the strategic vision of the 
Group which we are confident will create 
significant value as we accelerate the 
commercialisation of our product portfolio.
Sales in both CellRight and BioSurgery have 
had a strong start to the year, including 
shipments under two significant distributor 
agreements. With the recent launch of 
the CellRight DentalFix portfolio and 
AmnioWorks product, the approval of the 
OrthoPure™ XT CE mark and additional 
BioSurgery product line extensions 
expected to come on stream throughout the 
year, 2018 is set to be a year of significant 
newsflow, increasing commercial traction 
and revenue growth. 
Trading for 2018 remains in line with  
Board expectations.

STRATEGIC REPORT
FOR MORE INFORMATION ON  
OUR RISKS SEE PAGE 19 Financial Performance 
TRX BioSurgery reported revenues of 
£1,932K for the 12-month period (11 month 
period to December 2016: £1,322K), an 
increase of 46%. 
Gross margin for the 12 month period was 
53%, in line with prior year (11 month period 
to December 2016: 50%), and reflects 
the continued programme of providing 
evaluation units and improving market 
penetration. Gross margins are stated after 
deducting cost of external commissions 
(previously expensed as administration 
expenses) in order to provide a clearer view 
of costs directly associated with generating 
revenue. External commissions paid in the 
year were £588K (11 months to December 
2016: £376K).
Clinical uses of the product expanded 
throughout the year, with the move to 
a more in-patient focus, addressing 
the surgical, wound reconstruction and 
orthopaedic trauma application areas. In 
order to address these new clinical uses, 
sales and marketing costs of £64K were 
incurred in the period (11 month period to 
December 2016: £79K), which are expected 
to yield revenue benefits in FY18. 
Business Review 
2017 was another successful year for 
DermaPure
®
 as we continue to establish 
momentum and sales traction. The GPO 
agreements with Premier and Vizient 
have now been in place for a full year 
and allowed us to access a new quota of 
hospitals. During 2017, over 30 DermaPure
®
 
evaluations were undertaken, and over 
another 25 initiated due to complete 
during 2018. Our clinical affairs team 
continue to identify and monitor relevant 
case studies with 13 in-patient cases 
followed highlighting DermaPure
®
’s positive 
clinical outcome for replacing tissue and in 
providing structural support. 
Throughout the year, the uses of 
DermaPure
®
 expanded into new clinical 
areas with particular focus on urological and 
gynaecological applications. This was in part 
led by the need for innovation in this area, 
with the increasing scrutiny and reluctance 
to use mesh based products to treat cases 
of pelvic organ prolapse. DermaPure
®
 has 
proven to be an optimal treatment solution 
in these cases. 
Our sales teams continue to convert large 
integrated delivery networks (IDN) and larger 
hospital accounts, with significant approvals 
from the Memorial Hermann and Cleveland 
Clinic Health System. Moving forward, 
with the acceptance of DermaPure
®
 in 
surgical and trauma cases, we will focus 
on targeting large volume accounts driving 
advocacy for DermaPure
®
’s use in a broader 
range of clinical settings.
To expand the opportunity, we signed an 
exclusive distributor agreement with ARMS 
Medical, a specialist urogynaecology 
distributor. The agreement provides rights 
to distribute DermaPure
®
 to hospitals 
and surgeons throughout the United 
States for use in urology and gynaecology 
procedures from February 2018. Our 
partnership with ARMS Medical allows us 
to leverage their strong relationships with 
Key Opinion Leaders in the urogynaecology 
space, allowing us to further penetrate 
this market segment without losing any of 
our commercial traction and focus in other 
target market segments.

12 Outlook and Business 
Developments 
We view 2018 as a significant year for  
TRX BioSurgery.
In February 2018, Tissue Regenix Wound 
care, Inc. began trading under the name TRX 
BioSurgery, addressing the progression of 
the division from a pure wound care focus. 
We continue to pursue our hybrid sales 
model, utilising both direct reps and 
distributors thereby allowing us to maintain 
our focus in the original wound care settings, 
while also driving awareness and education 
in new clinical areas of Orthopaedic Trauma, 
Plastics and General Surgery.
DermaPure
®
 continues to offer a cost-
effective solution to healthcare providers 
and with the insourcing of manufacturing 
at the CellRight facility, we intend to launch 
additional line extensions to address these 
new surgical application areas. 
We have also expanded our clinical affairs 
teams to augment our sales reps and 
strengthen our clinical argument and 
engagement. With the growing importance 
of real world clinical data, we will commence 
a prospective observational study at four 
centres situated around the US to enhance 
our health economic argument. 
The US national account team and the 
field sales force continue to leverage our 
‘Innovative Technology’ awards with the 
Premier and Vizient Group Purchasing 
Organisations, provide coverage for 
approximately 75% of patient beds in 
the US, and focus on driving usage 
with ongoing contract negotiations and 
evaluations. Securing these partnerships 
will have a positive influence on contracting 
decisions as well as driving awareness. 
SurgiPure

 XD, a decellularized porcine 
dermis for use in hernia repair, has 
entered at the Tissue Regenix facility 
in the UK. Approved under the 510(k) 
market clearance route, we will continue 
to seek out relevant partnerships for the 
commercialization of this product.
With growing clinical advocacy throughout 
the hospital groups, we expect positive 
uptake of our products to continue, and 
with a bolstered product portfolio and 
partnership opportunities, we expect 
to report many positive inflection points 
throughout 2018.

ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS  
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2017
13 Financial Overview 
Investment continued in the period with 
development costs of £894K (11 months 
to December 2016: £1,221K). Marketing 
costs have also been incurred in advance 
of the OrthoPure™
 
XT EU launch currently, 
expected to be launched during 2018 
subject to CE mark approval. With ongoing 
business development in the US, initial costs 
around a FDA approved pre-clinical trial for 
OrthoPure™
  
XT have been incurred. We 
expect to see the first revenues from our 
orthopaedic dCELL
®
 products during FY18.
Business Review 
OrthoPure™ XT, to address primary and 
revision ACL reconstruction, continues 
to progress through the regulatory body 
for CE mark approval. With positive 
clinical data being reported at 1 year we 
have developed additional indications 
to also encompass extra-articular knee 
reconstruction procedures. Pre-launch 
marketing activities continue and we expect 
that we will receive approval and begin 
commercialization during 2018. Initially we 
will target 4 key European countries where 
we have developed distributor relationships 
and where we believe market demand and 
clinical uptake will be achieved. 
This data has also been used to validate the 
application made to the FDA to commence 
a pilot trial in the US. With the support of our 
clinical advisory board, we have appointed 
approved centres to take part in this study 
and our aim is to commence and enrol all 
patients by the end of 2018. 
The pilot trial is the initial step needed 
to apply for a pivotal study which in turn 
would facilitate a Pre-Market Approval 
application for US market clearance. We are 
currently investigating potential go to market 
strategies for this opportunity to allow the 
buildout of a long-term strategy around our 
presence in the US Orthopaedic market. 
In tandem with this, the technology transfer 
to produce OrthoPure™ HT, a decellularized 
human tendon at the CellRight facility 
has commenced. This will allow us to 
build clinical advocacy around dCELL
®
 
applications whilst the clinical trial for 
OrthoPure™ XT is undertaken. 
Throughout the year we also worked closely 
with our BioSurgery division to introduce 
DermaPure
®
 into the orthopaedic soft tissue 
market where it could be used as a suitable 
option for tendon reinforcement, rotator cuff 
repair, and other surgical procedures. 
Outlook and  
Business Developments
We took significant steps in the 
commercialization of our dCELL
®
 portfolio 
throughout 2017. 
We are poised to commercialize 
OrthoPure™ XT in the EU market, subject 
to regulatory approval, and commence the 
processing of OrthoPure™ HT for the North 
American market. 
Combining dCELL
®
 (soft tissue) and 
BioRinse (Bone) technologies, our new 
portfolio allows us to be of greater interest 
to clinicians and potential strategic partners. 
During this year, we will attend a number 
of prestigious conferences as an enlarged 
company, including the American Academy 
of Orthopaedic Surgeons, the European 
Society of Sports Traumatology, knee 
surgery and Arthroscopy, and the North 
American Spine Society. 
Our aim throughout 2018 is to drive 
clinical advocacy of the dCELL
®
 and 
BioRinse applications and, working with 
our CellRight and BioSurgery colleagues, 
increase awareness of the versatility of our 
augmented product portfolio in various 
orthopaedic procedures.

14 Financial Overview 
In the period since acquisition, CellRight  
has contributed £2.2m to Group revenues 
and £277K profit to the overall Group 
operating loss. 
Business Review
We initiated the integration with Tissue 
Regenix in August 2017 and looked at 
ways to quickly maximise our combined 
experience and facilities. The Tissue 
Regenix US office-based workforce 
moved into the CellRight facility to allow 
collaborative working and culture. The 
initial steps for the technology transfer of 
DermaPure
®
 commenced, which will allow 
the Group to have an important second 
source supplier as demand increases, 
and we began to review the processing 
needs for the production of OrthoPure
™
 HT. 
Important business infrastructures were 
implemented to ensure compliance and 
standardisation across all functions including 
finance, human resources and marketing 
approval processes. 
Historically, we have commercialised our 
products through a network of distributors 
and white label (OEM) agreements. This 
continued during 2017 as we signed 
our first distribution agreement for our 
Amnion product, targeting applications 
in orthopaedics and ophthalmology. 
However, we can now also directly access 
the physicians’ offices under the Tissue 
Regenix direct sales reps, providing them an 
augmented product offering, expanding our 
distribution through independent and direct 
to customer channels. Alongside this, we 
signed agreements to be an OEM provider 
for 2 additional orthopaedic partners and 
added 2 dental partners. 
Throughout the year we bolstered our 
product portfolio with the addition of 
DentalFix, a portfolio of regenerative 
products for specific use in periodontal 
procedures, larger sizes of Matrix IQ, 
our human dermis for reconstructive 
procedures, and AmnioWorks, an amniotic 
membrane with indications in orthopaedics 
and opthalmology. 
In order to provide clinical advocacy and 
thought leadership we appointed a Board 
of Scientific Advisers who will provide 
relevant case studies offering real world 
clinical data and advising on future product 
developments. With the addition of Jeffrey 
Wood, MD as an adviser for spinal surgery, 
and Amir Hosseini, DDS as an adviser for 
dental surgery, we have the advantage 
of a well-rounded, experienced group 
of surgeons who will work closely with 
ourselves and the dCELL
®
 Orthopaedic 
Clinical Advisory Board. 
Outlook and Business 
Developments 
In March 2018 we announced a distribution 
agreement with Arthrex, Inc. a premier 
innovator of orthopaedic surgical solutions. 
This multi-year agreement will provide 
physician access to the BioRinse portfolio 
through the expanded Arthrex network. 
This is a pivotal agreement for CellRight and 
the wider Tissue Regenix Group, signifying 
the first major strategic partnership for the 
Company. In order to facilitate this contract, 
work was undertaken to ensure inventory 
would be available and other revenue 
streams not under served. 
The advantages of the synergies and 
opportunities provided by the acquisition 
are still being recognised. With the dCELL
®
 
Technology transfer tracking ahead of 
schedule we expect that we will be in a 
position to complete the validation worked 
needed for DermaPure
®
 processing in  
H1 2018. 
The application for a Human Tissue 
Authority licence for the UK facility based 
in Leeds would greatly expand the ability 
for the distribution of our BioRinse portfolio 
throughout the UK and the wider EU. We 
continue to establish the potential for cross-
selling products and leveraging commercial 
partnerships, maximising the value of the 
combined product portfolios, and expect 
that we will develop further opportunities 
for collaborative development and market 
access throughout the year.

We are preparing for the market launch 
of CardioPure™. Subject to regulatory 
approval, we expect sales for this division to 
commence during FY19. 
Business Review 
Throughout the period we continued to 
globally promote the compelling clinical 
argument for CardioPure™, validated by 
ongoing accumulation of positive clinical 
results. As such, our clinical colleague Dr 
Fransisco da Costa presented his findings 
at prestigious conferences including the 
Heart Valve Society Meeting, the 25th 
Annual Meeting of the Asian Society for 
Cardiovascular and Thoracic Surgery and 
the 31st Annual Meeting of the European 
Association of Cardiothoracic Surgery, as 
well as publishing articles in two major peer 
reviewed cardiac journals. His impressive 
clinical results also play a significant role 
in the EU regulatory application process 
currently ongoing. 
Outlook and Future 
Business Developments 
We expect that the German regulatory 
submission for CardioPure™ pulmonary 
and aortic valves will complete allowing for 
commercial activity to commence during 
2019. We will also continue to strengthen 
our clinical evidence by expanding into a 
multicentre paediatric follow-up study in 
Brazil and expect further publication of 
CardioPure™ pulmonary follow-up data and 
subanalysis in major peer reviewed US and 
EU journals. 
With the search for an ideal pericardial 
valve ongoing, there is huge interest from 
particularly paediatric cardiac surgeons in 
this potential business development. This 
patch could also be used as a springboard 
for developing biological surgical, 
transcatheter and sutureless heart valves.  STRATEGIC REPORT

Financial Summary 
Reported sales of £1,135K derived from the 
commercialisation of processed corneas. 
Continued Group investment of £247K in 
FY2017 relates to the EU commercialisation 
of DermaPure
®
 and CardioPure™; we 
expect this to commence during FY19. 
Business Review 
During the year the focus was to gain traction 
with the processed corneas, establish solid 
and expanding partnerships with donor 
institutions and progress the regulatory 
application for CardioPure™ in the EU. 
In our first full year of sales we grew to a 
12%
1
 market penetration of the German 
cornea market. Throughout the year we 
expanded our network of donor institutions 
and quickly established the sales traction 
we were expecting. 
We have been working closely with our 
colleagues at CellRight Technologies 
establishing ways to collaborate and the 
potential for technology transfers between 
the sites to access new markets. Our 
relationship with Dr Francisco da Costa 
and his research associates in Brazil also 
remains fundamental as we progress 
with the EU regulatory application for the 
CardioPure™ decellularized heart valves. 
An application for a production licence for 
cryo-preserved valves and vessels was also 
submitted at the end of 2017 and we expect 
this to be granted during 2018.
We continue to work closely with our higher 
education research partners. A grant was 
won in partnership with the University of 
Rostock and GBM-V enabling the set-up of 
a laminar airflow system which will enhance 
the pre-treatment of the dCELL
®
 products 
as well as allowing us to raise the first 
validation data.

 TRG estimate.
Outlook and Business 
Developments 
Receiving market approval for cryo-
preserved heart valves will allow us to take 
a first step into the EU Cardiac market and 
begin to pave the way for the introduction of 
the decellularized CardioPure™ heart valves 
expected in 2019. 
The transfer of the DermaPure
®
 technology 
will allow us to commence processing 
and distribute to the EU wound care and 
surgical markets, validated by the clinical 
data collected from DermaPure
®
 use in the 
US. With the approval of the Human Tissue 
Authority Licence to import and distribute 
the portfolio CellRight’s portfolio of BioRinse 
products, we continue to evaluate the 
opportunity to become a second source 
processor for the European market.  Sales 
In the year ended 31 December 2017 
revenue increased by 263% to £5,233K 
(2016: £1,443K). Revenue from existing 
businesses increased by 113% to £3,067K 
(2016: £1,443K). Revenue from CellRight

(2016: £713K). 
Trading Results
Administrative expenses increased by 
£1,649K from £11,773K to £13,422K. 
These included £1,098K of exceptional 
costs. Other costs increased by £551K. 
Overheads included staff costs (55%), 
sales and marketing (1%), research and 
development (11%), establishment and 
administration costs (33%). Operating loss 
was £10,816K (2016: £11,060K).
CellRight was acquired on 9 August 2017 
and the operating profit of £277K for the 
period to 31 December 2017 is included 
within the consolidated result.
Exceptional Items
Non-recurring costs include the costs of 
acquisition of CellRight of £996K and £102K 
of legal costs in relation to the LifeNet

Loss for the year was £9,421K 
(2016: £9,912K). The number of shares in 
issue during the year was 1,170,990,924 
(2016: 760,124,264) resulting in a basic loss 
per share of (1.00p) (2016: (1.29p)).
Balance Sheet
Cash absorbed by operations was £9,786K 
(2016: £10,811K)
The Company issued shares by way 
of a placing and subscription of shares 
which were admitted to AIM on 9 August 
2017. This raised proceeds of £40,000K 
which, after expenses of £2,318K, netted 
£37,682K. 
On 9 August 2017 the Group acquired 
CellRight for a maximum consideration of 
£23,078K, of which £19,945K was paid 
to the vendors on the acquisition date 
and £3,133K is payable contingent upon 
achieving performance criteria. The fair value 
of the contingent consideration is assessed 
at £2,718K. The fair value of the assets 
acquired was assessed at £7,359K. This 
includes £4,374K attributed to intangible 
assets not previously recognised in the 
financial statements of CellRight. Goodwill 
on acquisition was £15,304K.
At 31 December 2017 the Group had net 
assets of £39,522K (2016: £11,536K) of 
which cash in hand totalled £16,423K 
(2016: £8,173K).
Going Concern
The Group’s forecasts indicate it has 
sufficient resources until more than one year 
from the date of this report.
Current Trading  
and Prospects
There has been a strong start in sales of 
both CellRight and BioSurgery product, 
including shipments under two significant 
distributor agreements. The integration of 
CellRight is progressing well. 2018 promises 
to be a further year of revenue generation 
and product launch. Trading for 2018 
remains in line with expectations.

Financial Overview
NOTE: 2016 COMPARATIVES ARE FOR THE 11 MONTHS ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2016.  RISK AND IMPACT MITIGA TING FACTOR TREND 
Sourcing of Tissue 
This risk increased with the acquisition of CellRight whose 
product portfolio is entirely based upon the sourcing of high 
quality human allograft products.
The dCELL
®
 Technology portfolio continues to pursue a dual 
tissue strategy applying to both allograft and xenograft. 
We have agreements in place with a number of 
registered donor recovery organisations. This 
ensures that we do not rely on a single source 
provider and can ensure to meet the increasing 
demand for suitable donated tissue. 
Intellectual Property 
The commercial success of the Group hinges on our ability 
to exploit our intellectual property across the identified 
market opportunities. We hold a number of process patents; 
however, these can be difficult to defend. Infringement of 
our IP could be financially costly, both in terms of litigation 
and profits. 
We have a robust, global, IP portfolio protected 
through a number of patents which we monitor and 
contest accordingly. A number of processes are 
kept as “know-how” which offers further protection 
from infringement. 
Management of Cash 
The Company is currently consuming cash to fund working 
capital. While the Funds raised during 2017 are anticipated 
to provide funding for the foreseeable future there is no 
guarantee that the Company will not require additional 
funding in the future. 
We have in place a top of the range accounting 
system to monitor all cash expenditure and measure 
this against the commercial budget and forecast. 
Our R&D and product pipeline is closely mapped 
to ensure that we pursue opportunities within our 
budget and have a clear strategy to provide a ROI. 
Clinical T rials and Regulatory Pathways 
We have a number of ongoing clinical trials for our porcine 
dCELL
®
 Technology products. There is the potential for 
these applications to be lengthy due to the implementation 
of new directives. However, failure to comply with the 
necessary clinical and ethical work required by each territory 
would present a barrier to entry and could hold significant 
financial implications. 
We plan our clinical trials to allow for the broadest use 
of the clinical data, and the fastest route to market in 
line with the country-specific clinical regulations. 
T ransfer of T echnology to Partners
As our dCELL
®
 human tissue products are processed 
by a third party partner, there is the potential for a leak of 
Intellectual Property. 
Any transfer of Intellectual Property or “know-how” is 
done so under strict legal agreements and the Group 
looks to only undertake such arrangements with 
partners, and in territories where there is appropriate 
legal protection. With the acquisition of CellRight we 
also now have a manufacturing facility in which we 
can process human tissue products reducing the 
need for IP to transfer out of the Company.

STRATEGIC REPORT
Risks 
THE BOARD CAREFULLY CONSIDERS THE RISKS FACING THE GROUP AND 
ENDEAVOURS TO MINIMISE THEIR IMPACT THROUGH THE NECESSARY 
MITIGATING ACTIONS. THE PROMINENT RISKS FACING THE GROUP AT THIS 
TIME ARE LISTED BELOW.  RISK AND IMPACT MITIGA TING FACTOR TREND 
Retention of Staff 
Our success is built on our ability to retain the most 
appropriate staff. We have a number of roles which require 
specialised knowledge of our Technology and the Company. 
In order to to undertake these roles the employee may be 
privy to sensitive IP information. 
The Group ensures to incentivise staff through a 
range of benefits and share schemes. Employee 
development and training is one of the core 
fundamental beliefs of the Company and we 
encourage professional development and internal 
progression. We also continue to monitor the 
talent pool for relevant future recruitment. Staff 
who are privy to sensitive information are tied onto 
non-disclosure agreements and all clinical data for 
dCELL
®
 Technology is owned and specific to the 
Tissue Regenix Group. 
Damage to Manufacturing Facility
There is the potential for a damaging incident, e.g. fire, to 
occur at our manufacturing facilities. This would have an 
impact on our ability to produce our products and therefore 
potential sales. 
We have a comprehensive risk analysis procedure 
in place and a disaster management plan. Our 
facility is spit over separate buildings meaning that 
an incident can be contained within one area and 
should not affect all business activities. 
Product Quality 
The Group operates in highly regulated environments with 
strict quality requirements. Failure ot meet these standards 
could results on the loss of reputation, loss of revenues, loss 
of customers, recall costs as well as sanctions from  
the regulator.
The Group operates a strictly controlled quality 
management system, and has in-house experts to 
ensure compliance with all regulatory requirements. 
We test the quality of our products in-house 
and verify these results externally. Every lot of 
CellRight products is independently verified for 
osteoinductivity. 
 
Competition 
As the focus on regenerative medicine increases there may 
be products or companies that could be in direct competition 
with our product portfolio or decellularization technology 
which could potentially have a detrimental effect on the 
commercial success of the Company. This now includes to a 
much larger extend breakthroughs in modern technology. 
We continually monitor the competitive landscape in 
order to adopt the best positioning for our products. 
As demonstrated by the acquisition of CellRight we 
also look to undertake relevant M&A opportunities 
and enter strategic partnerships to further bolster 
our commercial positioning. 
Brexit 
It is currently unclear how the decision to leave the EU could 
affect the Company. For example, there may be changes 
implemented to the regulatory system under which our 
products are approved, import / export regulations could be 
affected and economic volatility and uncertainty may  
be possible. 
The Group continues to monitor developments 
relating to Brexit and receives relevant updates 
from advisers to ensure any potential risks are 
understood and mitigating actions implemented if 
needed. With the establishment of a controlled joint 
venture in Germany, the Company holds a corporate 
position within the EU and would therefore maintain 
a presence in both the UK and EU following the  
final decision.

employee loyalty. We also recognise the 
importance of employee engagement and 
offer a range of employee communication 
opportunities to ensure that feedback is 
collated and actioned, maintaining an open

safety of its employees, partners and at 
its manufacturing facilities is of paramount 
importance to ensure the smooth and

Governance Framework Legal & Regulatory 
We employ a number of legal and regulatory advisers, for both 
our stock exchange listing and also validation of our products and 
clinical trial pathways. 
Business Practices & Ethics 
As a company that operates in a highly regulated and sensitive 
environment, we ensure that we operate with a vigorous code of 
conduct and ethics. We also monitor any existing and potential 
partners to ensure that they align with our Company values.
Risk & Performance Management 
As a company we are well aware of, and continually monitor,  
the primary risks to our business, and any external developments 
that occur that could have a detrimental effect on the performance 
of the Company and look to take the necessary actions to mitigate 
any impact that these could have on our performance. Internally,  
we report our monthly performance against a number of objectives 
and COGs allowing us to track performance management,  
and identify any potential improvements to our structure and 
operational efficiencies. 
Communications 
We communicate any relevant Company news to external 
stakeholders in the most timely manner possible through the 
necessary news flow outlets. The Board reviews all relevant 
information to ensure that the correct information is adequately 
explained to offer transparency and a true reflection of the Company. 
Internal and cross company communications are equally as valued 
and we have a number of staff engagement initiatives in order to 
keep knowledge and alignment with the Corporate positioning, 
values and progress high. 
Corporate Governance 
The Directors recognise the importance of sound corporate 
governance and have observed the principles of the UK Corporate 
Governance Code, to the extent that they consider them 
appropriate for the Group’s size, throughout the accounting year. 
The Board 
The Board currently comprises one Executive Director, a Non- 
Executive Chairman, and four Non-Executive Directors. 
Audit Committee 
The Audit Committee’s primary responsibilities are to monitor the 
integrity of the financial affairs and statements of the Company, 
to ensure that the financial performance of the Company and any 
subsidiary of the Company is properly measured and reported 
on, to review reports from the Company’s Auditor relating to the 
accounting and internal controls and to make recommendations 
relating to the appointment of the external Auditor. 
The Audit Committee comprises Alan Miller, who acts as chairman 
of the committee, Jonathan Glenn and Randeep Grewal.
Internal Control 
The Board is responsible for maintaining a sound system of 
internal control. The Board’s measures are designed to manage 
not eliminate risk, and such a system provides reasonable but not 
absolute assurance against material misstatement or loss. The 
Board confirms that it has established the procedures necessary to 
implement the guidance “Internal Control Guidance for Directors on 
the Combined Code” (The Turnbull Report). Some key features of 
the internal control system are: i. Management accounts information, 
budgets, forecasts and business risk issues are regularly reviewed 
by the Board who meet at least ten times per year; ii. The Company 
has operational, accounting and employment policies in place; iii. 
The Board actively identifies and evaluates the risks inherent in the 
business and ensures that appropriate controls and procedures 
are in place to manage these risks; iv. There is a clearly defined 
organisational structure; and v. There are well-established financial 
reporting and control systems. 
Going Concern 
At 31 December 2017, the Group had £16.4m of cash and cash 
equivalents available to it, with an updated balance of £16.0m at 
28 February 2018.
The Directors have considered their obligation, in relation to the 
assessment of the going concern of the Group and each statutory 
entity within it. They have reviewed the current cash position, budget 
cash forecasts and assumptions as well as the main risk factors 
facing the Group as set out on page 19.
The Directors consider that the Group has sufficient funds to continue 
its activities for note less than 12 months from the date of the 
approval of these financial statements. These financial statements 
have therefore been prepared on the going concern basis.

25 Remuneration Policy
The Group’s policy is to provide Executive Directors with a 
competitive market-based package in order to reward individual and 
Group performance and deliver outstanding shareholder returns. 
The Remuneration Committee is committed to ensuring that the 
Company’s key executive team is incentivized to drive sustainable 
earnings growth and returns to shareholders, thereby creating a 
genuinely strong alignment of interests between management and 
investors. 
It is the Company’s policy that Executive Directors should have 
contracts with an indefinite term providing for a maximum of six 
months’ notice. In the event of early termination, the Directors’ 
contracts provide for compensation up to a maximum of basic 
salary for the notice period.
Non-Executive Directors are employed on letters of appointment 
which may be terminated on not less than three months’ notice. 
Companies with securities listed on AIM do not need to comply with 
the UKLA Listing Rules. The Remuneration Committee is however 
committed to maintaining high standards of corporate governance 
and disclosure and has applied the guidelines as far as practical 
given the current size and development of the Company.
Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee’s primary responsibilities are to review 
the performance of the Executive Directors of the Company and to 
determine the broad policy and framework for their remuneration 
and the terms and conditions of their service and that of senior 
management (including the remuneration of and grant of options to 
such persons under any share scheme adopted by the Company). 
The Remuneration Committee comprised Steven Couldwell, who 
was chairman of the committee, Randeep Grewal, and Alan Miller 
until the appointment of Steve Couldwell as CEO on 2 November 
2017. Subsequently Randeep Grewal assumed the chair of the 
committee and the other members comprised Alan Miller and 
Jonathan Glenn. The committee meets no less than twice in each 
financial year.
The main elements of the remuneration packages for Executive 
Directors and senior management are:
Basic annual salary
The base salary is reviewed annually at the beginning of each year. 
The review process is undertaken by the Remuneration Committee 
and takes into account several factors, including the current position 
and development of the Group, individual contribution and market 
salaries for comparable organisations. 
Discretionary annual bonus
All Executive Directors and senior managers are eligible for a 
discretionary annual bonus which is paid in accordance with a 
bonus scheme developed by the Remuneration Committee. This 
takes into account individual contribution, business performance 
and commercial progress, along with financial results.
On 24 April 2014 the Remuneration Committee approved the 
implementation of a deferred annual bonus plan to commence from 
the financial year ended 31 January 2014 (the “Deferred Annual 
Bonus Plan”). Under the terms of the Deferred Annual Bonus Plan, 
Directors and senior managers may waive up to 50% of their annual 
cash bonus and in return receive a share option over ordinary shares 
in the Company (the “Deferred Allocation”). The number of ordinary 
shares comprising the Deferred Allocation (i.e. subject to the option) 
will be calculated by dividing the amount of the cash bonus waived 
by the closing market value of the ordinary shares of the Company 
on the dealing day immediately prior to the date of deferral of the 
bonus. The Deferred Allocation option is not capable of exercise until 
the vesting date has been reached which is three years from the 
date of grant of the award. By participating in the Deferred Annual 
Bonus Plan Directors and senior managers will be entitled to receive 
a matching award at no additional cost (the “Matching Allocation”). 
The Matching Award will be an option over ordinary shares in the 
Company. The number of ordinary shares comprising the Matching 
Allocation will be equivalent to three times the number of ordinary 
shares received in the Deferred Allocation. Participants will not be 
entitled to receive the Matching Allocation until the vesting date is 
reached which is three years from the date of grant of the award. 
Additionally participants will not be entitled to receive the Matching 
Award unless shares price growth performance targets have been 
achieved and those price targets sustained for 30 consecutive days. 
Share incentive schemes
The Group operates a share option plan, under which certain 
Directors and senior management have been granted options to 
subscribe for ordinary shares. All options are equity settled. The 
options are subject to service and performance conditions, have 
an exercise price of between 0.5 pence and 22.5 pence and 
the vesting period is generally 1– 3 years. If the options remain 
unexercised after a period of 10 years from the date of grant, the 
options expire. The Group has no legal or constructive obligation to 
repurchase or settle the options in cash.
In addition, certain Executive Directors are eligible to acquire 
interests in ordinary shares in the Company to be owned jointly 
with the trustee of the Tissue Regenix Group Employee Share Trust 
(EBT) and under which, subject to meeting performance criteria 
conditions, most of any future increase in the value of the shares will 
accrue to the employees.
Remuneration Policy for  
Non-Executive Directors
Remuneration for Non-Executive Directors is set by the Chairman 
and the Executive Members of the Board. Non-Executives do not 
participate in bonus schemes.

John Samuel have interests in ordinary shares in the Company which were 
acquired jointly with the Trustee in the market on 29 June 2010 at a price 
of 5 pence per share. Ian Jefferson has an interest in ordinary shares in the 
Company which were acquired jointly with the Trustee in the market on 25 
July 2012 at a price of 14.25 pence. The shares were all acquired pursuant to 
certain conditions set out in Joint Owned Equity agreements (“JOEs”). Subject 
to meeting the performance criteria conditions set out in the JOEs, most of 
any future increase in the value of the shares will accrue to the employees 
provided that they have not ceased employment with the Group on or before 
the date that these conditions are met. The employees are also under certain 
circumstances able to benefit from an increase in the value of the shares on a 
takeover, change of control, scheme of arrangement or a voluntary winding-up 
of the Company. Where the performance conditions are not met, the Trustee 
has an option to acquire the interests of the employees in the shares at a price 
equal to the original purchase cost they paid so that none of any increase in 
the value of the shares will accrue to them. The market price of the shares at 
31 December 2017 was 9.25 pence per share, the highest and lowest prices 
during the year were 20.25 pence and 5.63 pence respectively. Further details 
of all share options and jointly owned shares held by the Trustee are set out in

30 The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report and 
the Group and parent Company financial statements in accordance 
with applicable law and regulations. 
Company law requires the directors to prepare Group and parent 
Company financial statements for each financial year. As required 
by the AIM Rules of the London Stock Exchange, they are required 
to prepare the Group financial statements in accordance with 
International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the EU 
(IFRSs as adopted by the EU) and applicable law and have elected to 
prepare the parent Company financial statements on the same basis.
Under company law the Directors must not approve the financial 
statements unless they are satisfied that they give a true and fair 
view of the state of affairs of the Group and parent Company and of 
their profit or loss for that period. In preparing each of the Group and 
parent Company financial statements, the Directors are required to: 
 { select suitable accounting policies and then apply them 
consistently; 
 { make judgements and estimates that are reasonable, relevant 
and reliable; 
 { state whether they have been prepared in accordance with IFRSs 
as adopted by the EU; 
 { assess the Group and parent Company’s ability to continue as a 
going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going 
concern; and 
 { use the going concern basis of accounting unless they either 
intend to liquidate the Group or the parent Company or to cease 
operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so. 
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting 
records that are sufficient to show and explain the parent Company’s 
transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the 
financial position of the parent Company and enable them to ensure 
that its financial statements comply with the Companies Act 2006. 
They are responsible for such internal control as they determine is 
necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are 
free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and 
have general responsibility for taking such steps as are reasonably 
open to them to safeguard the assets of the Group and to prevent 
and detect fraud and other irregularities. 
Under applicable law and regulations, the Directors are also 
responsible for preparing a Strategic Report and a Directors’ Report 
that comply with that law and those regulations. 
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of 
the corporate and financial information included on the company’s 
website. Legislation in the UK governing the preparation and 
dissemination of financial statements may differ from legislation in 
other jurisdictions.

Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities
IN RESPECT OF THE ANNUAL REPORT AND THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  1. Our opinion is unmodified
We have audited the financial statements of Tissue Regenix Group 
plc (“the Company”) for the year ended 31 December 2017 which 
comprise the group statement of comprehensive income, group 
and parent company statement of changes in equity, the group 
and parent company statement of financial position, the group and 
company statement of cash flows, and the related notes, including 
the accounting policies in note 1.
In our opinion:
 { the financial statements give a true and fair view of the state  
of the Group’s and of the parent Company’s affairs as at 
31 December 2017 and of the Group’s loss for the year  
then ended;
 { the group financial statements have been properly prepared in 
accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as 
adopted by the European Union (IFRSs as adopted by the EU);
 { the parent Company financial statements have been properly 
prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU and as 
applied in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 
2006; and
 { the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with 
the requirements of the Companies Act 2006.
Basis for opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards 
on Auditing (UK) (“ISAs (UK)”) and applicable law. Our responsibilities 
are described below. We have fulfilled our ethical responsibilities 
under, and are independent of the Group in accordance with, UK 
ethical requirements including the FRC Ethical Standard as applied 
to listed entities. We believe that the audit evidence we have 
obtained is a sufficient and appropriate basis for our opinion.

2. Key audit matters: our assessment of risks of material misstatement
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement, were of most significance in the audit of the financial statements 
and include the most significant assessed risks of material misstatement (whether or not due to fraud) identified by us, including those which 
had the greatest effect on: the overall audit strategy; the allocation of resources in the audit; and directing the efforts of the engagement 
team. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, 
and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. In arriving at our audit opinion above, the key audit matters, in decreasing order 
of audit significance, were as follows: (2016: going concern and recoverability of trade debtors).
THE RISK OUR RESPONSE
Business combinations accounting 
including valuation of acquired 
goodwill and acquired intangible 
assets
Acquired goodwill £15.3 million; Acquired 
intangible assets £4.4 million
Refer to page 40 (accounting policy) and 
page 55 (financial disclosures).
Subjective valuation
The Group acquired CellRight 
Technologies LLC in the year.
The exercise to identify and recognise 
tangible and intangible assets acquired 
involves a significant degree of judgement 
on the inputs used to value the assets 
including future cash flows, discount rates 
and useful economic life and is a material 
estimate.
Our procedures included:
 { Accounting analysis: We assessed the judgements 
taken around fair value adjustments having regard to 
relevant accounting standards. Considering the separately 
identified intangible assets acquired through gaining an 
understanding of the business acquired and applying our 
professional experience and judgement;
 { Assessing valuer’s credentials: We evaluated the 
competence and independence of the valuer through 
verification of experts credentials and qualifications;
 { Benchmarking assumptions: challenging the basis for 
the key assumptions used in the valuation such as discount 
rate, growth rates and customer churn rates applied in the 
valuation of acquired intangibles having regard to internal 
and external data; and
 { Assessing transparency: considering the adequacy of 
the Groups disclosures in respect of business combinations

Independent Auditor’s Report
TO THE MEMBERS OF TISSUE REGENIX GROUP PLC THE RISK OUR RESPONSE
Recoverability of parent company’s 
investment in subsidiaries and loan 
due from group entities
(Investments £12.9 million; 2016: £12.9 
million, Intercompany loans balance £64.4 
million; 2016 £36.5 million)
Refer to page 64 (financial disclosures).
Forecast-based valuation
The carrying amount of the parent 
company’s investments in subsidiaries 
and group loan balance are significant 
and atrisk of not being recoverable, due 
to the continued losses made in some 
subsidiaries. The estimated recoverable 
amount of these balances is subjective 
due to the inherent uncertainty in 
forecasting trading conditions and cash 
flows used in thebudgets.
Our procedures included:
 { Benchmarking assumptions: Challenging the 
assumptions used in the cash flows included in the 
budgets including growth rates and discount rates to 
externally derived data;
 { Sensitivity analysis: Performing breakeven analysis on 
the assumptions noted above;
 { Comparing valuations: Comparing the sum of the of the 
discounted cash flow’s to the Group’s market capitalisation 
to assess reasonableness of those cash flows; and
 { Assessing transparency: Assessing the adequacy of the 
parent company’s disclosures in respect of the investment 
in subsidiaries and group loan balance.
Completeness of capitalised 
development costs
Development cost assets £0.6million 
(2016: £0.6million)
Development costs expensed: £2.7 million 
(2016: £3.1million)
Refer to page 42 (accounting policy) and 
page 51 (financial disclosures).
Accounting treatment
Project development costs should be 
capitalised if they meet the relevant 
accounting standard.
This requires, among other things, an 
assessment of the technical stage of the 
project and the future commercial outturn 
of the project. The costs are otherwise 
expensed as incurred.
Due to the above, assessing whether the 
capitalisation criteria are met is inherently 
judgemental and there is a risk that the 
appropriate point in time for capitalisation 
is not identified appropriately and 
therefore costs continue to be expensed 
when they should be capitalised.
Our procedures included:
 { Accounting analysis: Assessing the nature of the items 
expensed and assessing the appropriateness of their 
classification as expenses, having regard to the relevant 
accounting standard;
 { Test of detail: Agreeing a sample of costs to supporting 
documentation; and
 { Assessing transparency: Assessing the adequacy of the 
Groups disclosures in respect of the judgements made.
We continue to perform procedures over going concern. However, following the equity placement in in the year we have not assessed this 
as one of the most significant risks in our current year audit and, therefore, it is not separately identified in our report this year. We continue 
to perform procedures over trade debtors. However, following reduced aged debt in the year we have not assessed this as one of the most 
significant risks in our current year audit and, therefore, it is not separately identified in our report this year.

3. Our application of materiality and an 
overview of the scope of our audit
Materiality for the group financial statements as a whole was set at 
£250k (2016: £160k), determined with reference to a benchmark of 
loss before tax (of which it represents 2.3% (2016: 1.2%) of gross 
assets.) The change in benchmark is as a result of the acquisition in 
the year leading to increased income statement focus by the users 
of the accounts.
Materiality for the parent company financial statements as a whole 
was set at £200k (2016: £24k), determined with reference to a 
benchmark of company total assets, of which it represents 0.2% 
(2016: 1.5% of loss before tax). The change in benchmark is as a 
result of the acquisition in the year.
We agreed to report to the Audit Committee any corrected or 
uncorrected identified misstatements exceeding £12.5k, in addition 
to other identified misstatements that warranted reporting on 
qualitative grounds
Of the group’s 12 (2016: 9) reporting components, we subjected 
8 (2016: 7) to full scope audits for group purposes and 1 (2016: 
0) to specified risk-focused audit procedures over revenue. The 
component for which we performed work other than audits for 
group reporting purposes was not individually significant but were 
included in the scope of our group reporting work in order to provide 
further coverage over the group’s results.

going concern
We are required to report to you if we have concluded that the use 
of the going concern basis of accounting is inappropriate or there is 
an undisclosed material uncertainty that may cast significant doubt 
over the use of that basis for a period of at least twelve months from 
the date of approval of the financial statements. We have nothing to 
report in these respects.
5. We have nothing to report on the other 
information in the Annual Report
The Directors are responsible for the other information presented in 
the Annual Report together with the financial statements. Our opinion 
on the financial statements does not cover the other information and, 
accordingly, we do not express an audit opinion or, except as explicitly 
stated below, any form of assurance conclusion thereon.
Our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, 
consider whether, based on our financial statements audit work, 
the information therein is materially misstated or inconsistent with 
the financial statements or our audit knowledge. Based solely on 
that work we have not identified material misstatements in the  
other information.
Strategic report and Directors’ report
Based solely on our work on the other information:
 { we have not identified material misstatements in the strategic 
report and the Directors’ report;
 { in our opinion the information given in those reports for the 
financial year is consistent with the financial statements; and
 { in our opinion those reports have been prepared in accordance 
with the Companies Act 2006.
6. We have nothing to report on the other 
matters on which we are required to 
report by exception
Under the Companies Act 2006, we are required to report to you if, 
in our opinion:
 { adequate accounting records have not been kept by the parent 
Company, or returns adequate for our audit have not been 
received from branches not visited by us; or
 { the parent Company financial statements are not in agreement 
with the accounting records and returns; or
 { certain disclosures of Directors’ remuneration specified by law 
are not made; or
 { we have not received all the information and explanations we 
require for ouraudit.
We have nothing to report in these respects.
7 . Respective responsibilities
Directors’ responsibilities
As explained more fully in their statement set out on page 31, 
the Directors are responsible for: the preparation of the financial 
statements including being satisfied that they give a true and fair 
view; such internal control as they determine is necessary to enable 
the preparation of financial statements that are free from material 
misstatement, whether due to fraud or error; assessing the Group 
and parent Company’s ability to continue as a going concern, 
disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern; and 
using the going concern basis of accounting unless they either 
intend to liquidate the Group or the parent Company or to cease 
operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.
Auditor’s responsibilities
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether 
the financial statements as a whole are free from material 
misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue our 
opinion in an auditor’s report. Reasonable assurance is a high level 
of assurance, but does not guarantee that an audit conducted 
in accordance with ISAs (UK) will always detect a material 
misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or 
error and are considered material if, individually or in aggregate, they 
could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions 
of users taken on the basis of the financial statements.
A fuller description of our responsibilities is provided on the FRC’s 
website at www.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities.
8. The purpose of our audit work and to 
whom we owe our responsibilities
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body, in

39 Notes to the Financial Statements
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2017
1) BASIS OF PREPARATION
The financial statements of Tissue Regenix Group plc are audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2017. 
These include audited comparatives for the 11 month period ended 31 December 2016.
The Group financial statements consolidate the financial statements of Tissue Regenix Group plc and the entities it controls, being its 
subsidiaries and its joint venture interest.
Going concern
As at 31 December 2017, the Group had £16.4m of cash and cash equivalents available to it. The Directors have considered their obligation, 
in relation to the assessment of the going concern of the Group and each statutory entity within it and have reviewed the current budget 
cash forecasts and assumptions as well as the main risk factors facing the Group as set out on pages 19-20.
After due enquiry, the Directors consider that the Group has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable 
future. Accordingly, they continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the financial statements. As is the nature of the business, 
the Directors acknowledge there will be further funding requirements before revenues have grown to the point of self sufficiency
Change in accounting presentation
Cost of sales in the Group’s financial statements comprises cost of goods sold and external commissions payable. This is a change from 
previous years where external commissions were expensed as administration expenses. The change is because the Directors believe this 
presentation gives the users of the accounts a clearer view of the costs directly associated with generating revenue.
This change has increased Cost of sales by £376,000 from what was previously presented in the 11 months to December 2016 with a 
corresponding reduction in the administration expenses. The impact on the 2017 figure is an increase of £588,000 with a corresponding 
reduction in administration expenses. The loss before tax and earnings per share in both the current year and prior period are unaffected by 
this change.
2) SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention in accordance with International Financial 
Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union.
The principal accounting policies applied are set out below.
Basis of consolidation
Subsidiaries are entities controlled by the Group. The Group controls an entity when it is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from 
its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity. In assessing control, the Group 
takes into consideration potential voting rights. The acquisition date is the date on which control is transferred to the acquirer. The financial 
statements of subsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date that control commences until the date that 
control ceases. Losses applicable to the non-controlling interests in a subsidiary are allocated to the non-controlling interests even if doing 
so causes the non-controlling interests to have a deficit balance.
Transactions eliminated on consolidation
Intra-group balances and transactions, and any unrealised income and expenses arising from intra-group transactions, are eliminated. 
Unrealised gains arising from transactions with equity-accounted investees are eliminated against the investment to the extent of the Group’s 
interest in the investee. Unrealised losses are eliminated in the same way as unrealised gains, but only to the extent that there is no evidence 
of impairment.
Business combinations
All business combinations are accounted for by applying the acquisition method. Business combinations are accounted for using the 
acquisition method as at the acquisition date, which is the date on which control is transferred to the Group. 
The Group measures goodwill at the acquisition date as:
 { the fair value of the consideration transferred; plus 
 { the recognised amount of any non-controlling interests in the acquiree; plus
 { the fair value of the existing equity interest in the acquiree; less
 { the net recognised amount (generally fair value) of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed. 
When the excess is negative, a bargain purchase gain is recognised immediately in profit or loss.
Costs related to the acquisition, other than those associated with the issue of debt or equity securities, are expensed as incurred.
TICKER AIM: TRX 
www.tissueregenix.com
40 Any contingent consideration payable is recognised at fair value at the acquisition date. If the contingent consideration is classified as 
equity, it is not remeasured and settlement is accounted for within equity. Otherwise, subsequent changes to the fair value of the contingent 
consideration are recognised in profit or loss.
Goodwill
Goodwill arising on the acquisition of a subsidiary undertaking is the difference between the fair value of the consideration payable and the 
fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities acquired.
Impairment of non-financial assets
An impairment loss in respect of goodwill is not reversed. In respect of other assets, impairment losses recognised in prior periods are 
assessed at each reporting date for any indications that the loss has decreased or no longer exists. An impairment loss is reversed if there 
has been a change in the estimates used to determine the recoverable amount. An impairment loss is reversed only to the extent that the 
asset’s carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation or amortisation, if no 
impairment loss had been recognised.
Revenue
Revenue is measured as the fair value of the consideration received or receivable in the normal course of business, net of discounts, VAT 
and other sales related taxes and is recognised to the extent that it is probable that the economic benefits associated with the transaction 
will flow in to the Company.
Grant income is recognised as earned based on contractual conditions, generally as expenses are incurred.
Foreign currencies
The individual financial statements of each Group entity are presented in the currency of the primary economic environment in which the 
entity operates (its functional currency). For the purposes of the consolidated financial statements, the results and the financial position of 
each Group entity are expressed in Pounds Sterling, which is the functional currency of the Company and the presentational currency for the 
consolidated financial statements.
In preparing the financial statements of the individual entities, transactions in currencies other than the entity’s functional currency (foreign 
currencies) are recorded at the rates of exchange prevailing at the dates of the transactions. At each balance sheet date, monetary items 
denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rates prevailing at the balance sheet date. Non-monetary items carried at fair value 
that are denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rates prevailing at the date when the fair value was determined.
Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in foreign currency are not retranslated.
The assets and liabilities of foreign operations are translated using exchange rates at the balance sheet date. The components of 
shareholders’ equity are stated at historical value. An average exchange rate for the period is used to translate the results and cash flows of 
foreign operations.
Exchange differences arising on translating the results and net assets of foreign operation are taken to the translation reserve in equity until 
the disposal of the investment. The gain or loss in the income statement on the disposal of foreign operations includes the release of the 
translation reserve relating to the operation that is being sold.

2) SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES continued
Research and development
Research costs are charged to profit and loss as they are incurred. An intangible asset arising from development expenditure on an 
individual project is recognised only when all of the following criteria can be demonstrated:
 { it is technically feasible to complete the product and the management is satisfied that appropriate regulatory hurdles have been or will be 
achieved;
 { management intends to complete the product and use or sell it;
 { there is an ability to use or sell the product;
 { it can be demonstrated how the product will generate probable future economic benefits; 
 { adequate technical, financial and other resources are available to complete the development, use or sell the product; and
 { expenditure attributable to the product can be reliably measured.
Such intangible assets are amortised on a straight-line basis, from the point at which the assets are ready for use over the period of the 
expected benefit, and are reviewed for an indication of impairment at each reporting date. Other development costs are charged against 
profit or loss as incurred since the criteria for capitalisation are not met.
The costs of an internally generated intangible asset comprise all directly attributable costs necessary to create, produce and prepare the 
asset to be capable of operating in the manner intended by management. Directly attributable costs include employee costs incurred on 
technical development, testing and certification, materials consumed and any relevant third party cost. The costs of internally generated 
developments are recognised as intangible assets and are subsequently measured in the same way as externally acquired intangible assets. 
However, until completion of the development project, the assets are subject to impairment testing only.
Exceptional items
Items which are significant by virtue of their size or nature and/or which are considered non-recurring are classified as an exceptional 
operating items. Such items, which include for example costs relating to acquisitions, litigation charges etc, are included within the 
appropriate consolidated income statement category but are highlighted separately. Exceptional operating items are excluded from the profit 
measures used by the Directors to monitor underlying performance. 
Leases
Rentals payable under operating leases, which are leases where the lessor retains a significant proportion of the risks and benefits of the 
asset, are charged in the statement of comprehensive income on a straight-line basis over the expected lease term.
Property, plant and equipment 
Property, plant and equipment assets are stated at historical cost.
Depreciation is provided on all property, plant and equipment assets at rates calculated to write each asset down to its estimated residual 
value evenly over its expected useful life, as follows:
Buildings over 39 years Fixtures and fittings over 5 years
Laboratory equipment over 5 years Land is not depreciated.
Computer equipment over 3 years
Intangible assets
Intangible assets are stated at fair value. Amortisation is provided on all intangibles over its expected useful life.
Trademarks over 5 years Process & IT technology over 5 years
Customer relationships over 10 years Supplier agreements over 5 years
Impairment of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets
At each reporting date, the Group reviews the carrying amounts of its property, plant and equipment and intangible assets to determine 
whether there is any indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss. If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of 
the asset is estimated in order to determine the extent of the impairment loss (if any).
Discounted cash flow valuation techniques are generally applied for assessing recoverable amounts using 3 year forward looking cash flow 
projections and terminal value estimates, together with discount rates appropriate to the risk of the related cash generating units. 
If the recoverable amount of an asset is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount of the asset is reduced to its 
recoverable amount. An impairment loss is recognised as an expense immediately.
TICKER AIM: TRX 
www.tissueregenix.com
42 Share based payments
Share options
Equity settled share based payment transactions are measured with reference to the fair value at the date of grant, recognised on a  
straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on the Company’s estimate of shares that will eventually vest. Fair value is measured using 
a binomial valuation model.
At each reporting date before vesting, the cumulative expense is calculated, representing the extent to which the vesting period has expired 
and management’s best estimate of the achievement or otherwise of non-market conditions and the number of equity instruments that will 
ultimately vest. The movement in cumulative expense since the previous reporting date is recognised in the statement of comprehensive 
income, with a corresponding entry in equity.
Jointly held shares
Where an employee acquires an interest in shares in the Company jointly with the Tissue Regenix Employee Share Trust, the fair value 
benefit at the purchase date is recognised as an expense, with a corresponding increase to equity share based payment reserve on a 
straight-line basis, over the vesting period.
The fair value benefit is measured using a binomial valuation model, taking into account the terms and conditions upon which the jointly 
owned shares were purchased.
The expected life used in the model has been adjusted, based on management’s best estimate, for the effect of non-transferability, sale 
restrictions, and behavioural considerations.
Financial assets and liabilities
Trade and other receivables
Trade and other receivables do not carry any interest and are initially recognised at fair value. They are subsequently measured at amortised 
cost using the effective interest rate method, less any provision for impairment.
Impairment provisions are recognised when there is objective evidence that the Group will be unable to collect all of the amounts due under 
the terms receivable, the amount of such a provision being the difference between the net carrying amount and the present value of the 
future expected cash flows associated with the impaired receivable.
Trade and other payables
Trade and other payables are not interest bearing and are initially recognised at fair value. They are subsequently measured at amortised 
cost using the effective interest method.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash at hand and deposits on a term of not greater than 12 months.
Share capital
Ordinary shares are classified as equity. Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares or options are shown in equity  
as a deduction.
Taxation
Tax on the profit or loss for the year comprises current and deferred tax. Tax is recognised in the profit and loss account except to the extent 
that it relates to items recognised directly in equity or other comprehensive income, in which case it is recognised directly in equity or other 
comprehensive income. 
Current tax is the expected tax payable or receivable on the taxable income or loss for the year, using tax rates enacted or substantively 
enacted at the balance sheet date, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years.
Deferred tax is provided on temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes 
and the amounts used for taxation purposes. The following temporary differences are not provided for: the initial recognition of goodwill; the 
initial recognition of assets or liabilities that affect neither accounting nor taxable profit other than in a business combination; and differences 
relating to investments in subsidiaries to the extent that they will probably not reverse in the foreseeable future. The amount of deferred 
tax provided is based on the expected manner of realisation or settlement of the carrying amount of assets and liabilities, using tax rates 
enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.

2) SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES continued
Controlled joint venture
Tissue Regenix Group entered a joint venture in January 2016 establishing GBM-V GmbH, a company in Germany. The results for this entity 
are consolidated within these accounts because the Group controls the majority of the voting rights.
Critical accounting estimates and areas of judgement
Estimates and judgements are continually evaluated and are based on historical experience and other factors, including expectations of 
future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates. The estimates 
and assumptions that have the most significant effects on the carrying amounts of the assets and liabilities in the financial information are 
discussed below:
Estimates
Equity settled share based payments
The estimation of share based payment costs requires the selection of an appropriate valuation method, consideration as to the inputs 
necessary for the valuation model chosen and the estimation of the number of awards that will ultimately vest. Inputs subject to judgement 
relate to the future volatility of the share price of comparable companies, the Group’s expected dividend yields, risk free interest rates and 
expected lives of the options. The Directors draw on a variety of sources to aid in the determination of the appropriate data to use in such 
calculations. The share based payment charge for the period was £30,000 (2016: £210,000).
Business Combinations
Determining a value for assets acquired
Determining the fair value of acquired intangible assets and goodwill acquired in business combinations requires the use of estimates. The 
values are determined using discounted cash flows and based upon latest approved budgets which include estimates on future cash flows, 
attrition rates and discount rate. 
Performing impairment tests
Subsequent impairment reviews also require the use of estimates to value the cash generating units to which goodwill and other intangible 
assets have been allocated. The value in use calculations, which are made on an annual basis for goodwill, or when there is an indicator of 
impairment for tangible and other intangible fixed assets, determine whether there is any impairment to the carrying value of assets arising 
from business combinations. More details of these estimates can be found in note 15.
Judgements
Deferred tax
The actual tax on the Company’s profits is determined according to complex laws and regulations. Where the effect of these laws and 
regulations is unclear, estimates are used in determining the liability for the tax to be paid on profits which are recognised in the financial 
statements. The Company considers the estimates, assumptions and judgements to be reasonable, but this can involve complex issues 
which may take a number of years to resolve. The final determination of tax liabilities could be different from the estimates reflected in the 
financial statements. Deferred tax assets and liabilities require management judgement in determining the amounts to be recognised. In 
particular, judgement is used when assessing the extent to which deferred tax assets should be recognised with consideration given to the 
timing and level of future taxable income.
Capitalisation of development costs 
The point at which development costs meet the criteria for capitalisation is a key judgement. During the year we capitalised development 
costs of £93,000 in respect of a product/products which we received US regulatory clearance to sell the product (510K approval). We deem 
this to be the point at which it becomes probable that future economic benefits will be received from the product and hence the criteria for 
capitalisation are met. If we had capitalised other product development costs, then there would have been a reduction of £2,687,000 to the 
loss reported in the income statement

44 Accounting standards and interpretations not applied
At the date of authorisation of these financial statements, the following standards and interpretations relevant to the Group that have not 
been applied in these financial statements were in issue but not yet effective: 
 Effective date
IFRS 9 Financial Instruments 1 January 2018
IFRS 15 Revenue from contracts from customers 1 January 2018
IFRS 16 Leases 1 January 2019
Amendments to IAS12 Recognition of Deferred Tax Assets for Unrealised Losses 1 January 2017
IFRIC 22 Foreign Currency Transactions and Advanced Consideration TBC
Amendments to IAS 28 Long-term Interests in Associates and Joint Ventures TBC
Amendments to IFRS 2 Classification and Measurement of Share based Payment Transactions TBC
Annual Improvements to IFRS Standards 2014–2016 cycle TBC
The following accounting standards that are due to be adopted in the next year will or may have an impact on the Group’s future financial 
statements:
IFRS 15 – Revenue from contracts with customers
The Group is required to adopt IFRS 15 from 1 January 2018. IFRS 15 establishes a comprehensive framework for determining whether, 
how much and when revenue is recognised. It replaces existing revenue recognition guidance, including IAS 18 Revenue, IAS 11 
Construction Contracts and IFRIC 13 Customer Loyalty Programmes. Currently only IAS 18 Revenue applies to the Groups accounts.
In order to assess the impact of the implementation of the new revenue standard on the Group’s consolidated financial statements, 
IFRS learning sessions will be organised incorporating representatives from finance, legal and commercial teams. Following from this a 
quantitative impact analysis will be developed and discussed in the first half of 2018. This has been delayed from 2017 due to the acquisition 
of CellRight in H2 2017 which makes up a significant element of the Group’s revenue (42% of total Group revenue in FY17; if CellRight was 
acquired at the start of the year revenue would represent 61% of the total Group revenue in 2017). 
While the impact still needs to be calculated, given the nature of invoicing revenue the Group does not believe the impact will be material.
IFRS 9 – Financial instruments 
The Group has assessed the impact of IFRS 9 which uses a single approach to determine whether a financial asset is measured at 
amortised cost or fair value, replacing many different rules in IFRS 39. The approach in IFRS 9 is based on how an entity manages its 
financial instruments and the contractual cash flow characteristics of the financial asset. 
The Group has considered the implications of IFRS 9 to have an immaterial impact.
No Standards or Interpretations adopted in the year had any material impact on the financial statements of the Group.

Analysis of revenue by customer
During the year ended 31 December 2017 the Group had two customers who individually exceeded 10% of revenue. These customers 
generated 13% and 11% of revenue respectively (2016:12% and 10%). 
Operating segments
The Group is organised into BioSurgery, Orthopaedics & Dental, Cardiac and Other divisions for internal management, reporting and

Basic loss per share is calculated by dividing the loss attributable to equity holders of the parent by the weighted average number of ordinary 
shares in issue during the period excluding own shares held jointly by the Tissue Regenix Employee Share Trust and certain employees. 
Diluted loss per share is calculated by adjusting the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the year to assume 
conversion of all dilutive potential ordinary shares.

13) RISK MANAGEMENT OF FINANCIAL ASSETS AND LIABILITIES
The Group’s activities expose it to a variety of financial risks: market risk, specifically interest rate risk, credit risk and liquidity risk. The 
Group’s overall risk management programme focuses on the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to minimise potential adverse 
effects on the Group’s financial performance. 
The management of these risks is vested in the Board of Directors. The policies for managing each of these risks are summarised below:
Management of market risk
Interest rate risk 
As the Group has no significant borrowings the risk is limited to the potential reduction in interest received on cash surpluses held. Interest 
rate risk is managed in accordance with the liquidity requirement of the Group, with a minimal amount of its cash surpluses held within 
short-term accounts, which have variable interest rates attributable to them, to ensure that sufficient funds are available to cover the working 
capital requirements of the Group. 
Interest rate sensitivity
The principal impact to the Company is the result of interest-bearing cash and cash equivalent balances held as set out below:
December 2017
 
Fixed rate

Floating rate
£000
Total
£000
Cash and cash equivalents 15,007 1,416 16,423
December 2016
 
Fixed rate
£000
Floating rate
£000
Total
£000
Cash and cash equivalents 7,654 519 8,173
Due to the high proportion of funds held on a fixed deposit, the impact of a 5% increase/decrease in interest rates would have an immaterial 
impact on the loss in each period.
Management of credit risk 
The Group is exposed to credit risk from its operating activities; it principally arises from short-term bank deposits. The Group seeks to 
minimise this risk by only depositing funds with banks with a high credit rating.
The maximum exposure to credit risk on the Group’s financial assets is represented by their carrying amounts as outlined in the 
categorisation of financial instruments table below. 
The Group does not consider that any changes in fair value of financial assets or liabilities in the year are attributable to credit risk. 
TICKER AIM: TRX 
www.tissueregenix.com
52 Management of liquidity risk
The Group seeks to manage liquidity risk to ensure that sufficient liquidity is available to meet foreseeable needs and to invest cash assets 
safely and profitably.
No maturity analysis for financial liabilities is presented, as the Directors consider that liquidity risk is not material.
The Group had cash and cash equivalents at each reporting date is set out below.

The above has been split by the Fitch rating system and gives an analysis of the credit rating of the financial institutions where cash balances 
are held.
Capital risk management
The Group manages its capital to ensure that the Group will be able to continue as a going concern while maximising the return to 
stakeholders. The Group’s overall strategy is to minimise costs and liquidity risk.
The capital structure of the Group consists of equity attributable to the owners of the Group, comprising issued capital, reserves and 
retained earnings as disclosed in note 17 and 18 and in the Statement of Changes in Equity.

Acquisition of CellRight Technologies
On 09 August 2017, the Group acquired 100% of the voting equity instruments of CellRight Technologies LLC. This acquisition was made 
as the first part of the expansion plan for the US group to process in-house human tissue products in the US. The Group anticipated the 
close relationship between CellRight and Tissue Regenix businesses will be mutually beneficial including shared resources in manufacturing, 
sales, marketing and accounting.

Acquisition-related costs
Acquisition costs relating to this transaction amounted to £996,000 and have been disclosed within the exceptional costs in the statement 
of comprehensive income.
Since the acquisition date, CellRight has contributed £2,166,000 to Group revenues and a profit of £277,000 to Group income. If the 
acquisition had occurred on 1 January 2017, Group Revenue would have increased by £2,930,000 and Group income for the period would 
have increased by £702,000.
Measurements of fair values
The valuation techniques used for measuring the fair value of material assets acquired were as follows.  
Assets acquired Valuation technique 
Property, plant and equipment Market comparison technique and cost technique: The valuation model considers market prices for 
similar items when they are available, and depreciated replacement cost when appropriate. Depreciated 
replacement cost reflects adjustments for physical deterioration as well as functional and economic 
obsolescence. 
Intangible assets Relief-from-royalty method and multi-period excess earnings method: The relief-from-royalty method 
considers the discounted estimated royalty payments that are expected to be avoided as a result of the 
patents or trademarks being owned. The multi-period excess earnings method considers the present 
value of net cash flows expected to be generated by the customer relationships, by excluding any cash 
flows related to contributory assets. 
Inventories Net realisable value: The fair value is determined based on the actual cost of the inventory items. 
The trade receivables comprise gross contractual amounts due of £713k, which was acquired with a provision of £265k which was 
expected to be uncollectible at the date of acquisition to give a net value of £448k.

20) SHARE BASED PAYMENTS
Share options and shares held in employee benefit trust (“EBT”)
The Company operates a share option plan, under which certain employees have been granted options to subscribe for ordinary shares. 
All options are equity settled. The options have an exercise price of between 0.5p to 22.5p and a vesting period between 1 and 3 years. If 
the options remain unexercised after a period of 10 years from the date of grant, the options expire. The Group has no legal or constructive 
obligation to repurchase or settle the options in cash.
The Group also operates a jointly owned EBT share scheme for senior management under which the trustee of the Group sponsored EBT 
has acquired shares in the Group jointly with a number of employees. The shares were acquired pursuant to certain conditions, set out in 
Jointly Owned Equity agreements (“JOEs”). Subject to meeting the performance criteria conditions set out in the JOEs, the employees are 
able to benefit from most of any future increase in the value of the jointly owned EBT shares. The fair value benefit is measured using the 
Binomial model, taking into account the terms and conditions upon which the jointly owned shares were purchased.

There were 7,499,918 share options outstanding at 31 December 2017 eligible to be exercised. The remaining options were not eligible 
to be exercised as these are subject to employment period and market based vesting conditions, some of which had not been met at 
31 December 2017.
The performance conditions in relation to these options allows for vesting in three equal proportions on or after the three consecutive annual 
anniversaries from the date of grant subject to the Company’s share price reaching certain hurdle values by the respective vesting dates. 
There were 16,112,800 of the jointly held EBT shares which were eligible to vest as at 31 December 2017. The remaining shares were not 
eligible to vest because the related employment period conditions and some of the performance conditions under the JOEs had not been met.
The fair value benefit received on share options granted is measured using the Binomial model taking in to account the effects of the vesting 
and performance conditions, expected exercise price and the payment of the dividends by the Company. The fair value benefits received on 
EBT shares are measured using the Binomial model, taking into account the terms and conditions upon which the jointly owned shares were 
purchased. The following table lists the inputs to the models used:

C7 . Critical accounting estimates
Estimates are continually evaluated and based on historical experience and other factors, including expectations of future events that 
we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates. The estimates that have the most 
significant effects on the carrying amounts of the assets and liabilities in the parent company financial statements are described below:
Investment in subsidiaries and intercompany loans
Investments in subsidiaries and intercompany loans receivable include some that, as is the nature of the business, relate to investments that 
have not yet reached profitability. Accordingly, where material, recoverability has been tested against value in use by reference to business 
projections. The assumptions used comprise Board-approved five year business plans, together with terminal growth of 3%, discounted at a 
weighted average cost of capital estimated at 11%. Notice of Annual General Meeting
Notice is given that the 2018 Annual General Meeting of Tissue Regenix Group plc (“Company”) will be held at DLA Piper UK LLP , Princes 
Exchange, Princes Square, Leeds, LS1 4BY on 24 May 2018 at 10.00 a.m. for the following purposes:
To consider and, if thought fit, to pass the following resolutions as ordinary resolutions:
1. To receive the Company’s annual accounts, strategic report and Directors’ and Auditor’s reports for the year ended 31 December 2017.

5. To authorise the Directors to determine the remuneration of the Auditor.

Relevant Securities:
6.1 up to an aggregate nominal amount of £1,951,652; and
6.2 comprising equity securities (as defined in section 560(1) of the Act) up to a further aggregate nominal amount of £1,951,652 in 
connection with an offer by way of a rights issue:
6.2.1  to holders of ordinary shares in the capital of the Company in proportion (as nearly as practicable) to the respective numbers of 
ordinary shares held by them; and
6.2.2  to holders of other equity securities in the capital of the Company, as required by the rights of those securities or, subject to 
such rights, as the Directors otherwise consider necessary,
but subject to such exclusions or other arrangements as the Directors may deem necessary or expedient in relation to treasury 
shares, fractional entitlements, record dates or any legal or practical problems under the laws of any territory or the requirements 
of any regulatory body or stock exchange, provided that these authorities shall expire at the conclusion of the next Annual General 
Meeting of the Company after the passing of this resolution or on 24 August 2019 (whichever is the earlier), save that, in each case, 
the Company may make an offer or agreement before the authority expires which would or might require Relevant Securities to be 
allotted after the authority expires and the Directors may allot Relevant Securities pursuant to any such offer or agreement as if the 
authority had not expired.
In this resolution, “Relevant Securities” means shares in the Company or rights to subscribe for or to convert any security into 
shares in the Company; a reference to the allotment of Relevant Securities includes the grant of such a right; and a reference to the 
nominal amount of a Relevant Security which is a right to subscribe for or to convert any security into shares in the Company is to the 
nominal amount of the shares which may be allotted pursuant to that right.
These authorities are in substitution for all existing authorities under section 551 of the Act (which, to the extent unused at the date of 
this resolution, are revoked with immediate effect).

Entitlement to attend and vote
1. The right to vote at the meeting is determined by reference to the register of members. Only those shareholders registered in the 
register of members of the Company as at 6:00 p.m. on 22 May 2018 (or, if the meeting is adjourned, 6:00 p.m. on the date which 
is two working days before the date of the adjourned meeting) shall be entitled to attend and vote at the meeting in respect of 
the number of shares registered in their name at that time. Changes to entries in the register of members after that time shall be 
disregarded in determining the rights of any person to attend or vote (and the number of votes they may cast) at the meeting.
Proxies
2.  A shareholder is entitled to appoint another person as his or her proxy to exercise all or any of his or her rights to attend and to speak 
and vote at the meeting. A proxy need not be a shareholder of the Company.
A shareholder may appoint more than one proxy in relation to the meeting, provided that each proxy is appointed to exercise the 
rights attached to a different share or shares held by that shareholder. Failure to specify the number of shares each proxy appointment 
relates to or specifying a number which when taken together with the numbers of shares set out in the other proxy appointments is in 
excess of the number of shares held by the shareholder may result in the proxy appointment being invalid.
A proxy may only be appointed in accordance with the procedures set out in notes 3 and 4 below and the notes to the proxy form.
The appointment of a proxy will not preclude a shareholder from attending and voting in person at the meeting.
3. A form of proxy is enclosed. When appointing more than one proxy, complete a separate proxy form in relation to each appointment. 
Additional proxy forms may be obtained by contacting the Company’s registrar on 0871 664 0300 (Calls cost 12p per minute plus 
your phone company’s access charge. Calls outside the United Kingdom will be charged at the applicable international rate. The 
Company’s registrar is open between 9:00 a.m. - 17:30 p.m. Monday to Friday excluding public holidays in England and Wales) or the 
proxy form may be photocopied. State clearly on each proxy form the number of shares in relation to which the proxy is appointed.
To be valid, a proxy form must be received by post or (during normal business hours only) by hand at the offices of the Company’s 
registrar, Link Asset Services PXS 1, 34 Beckenham Road, Beckenham BR3 4TU, no later than 10:00 a.m. on 22 May 2018 (or, if the 
meeting is adjourned, no later than 48 hours before the time of any adjourned meeting).
4. CREST members who wish to appoint a proxy or proxies for the meeting (or any adjournment of it) through the CREST electronic 
proxy appointment service may do so by using the procedures described in the CREST Manual. CREST personal members or other 
CREST sponsored members, and those CREST members who have appointed a voting service provider(s), should refer to their 
CREST sponsor or voting service provider(s), who will be able to take the appropriate action on their behalf.
In order for a proxy appointment or instruction made using the CREST service to be valid, the appropriate CREST message  
(a “CREST Proxy Instruction”) must be properly authenticated in accordance with Euroclear UK & Ireland Limited’s specifications 
and must contain the information required for such instructions, as described in the CREST Manual. The message, regardless of 
whether it constitutes the appointment of a proxy or is an amendment to the instruction given to a previously appointed proxy, must, 
in order to be valid, be transmitted so as to be received by Link Asset Services (ID RA10) no later than 10:00 a.m. on 22 May 2018 
(or, if the meeting is adjourned, no later than 48 hours before the time of any adjourned meeting). For this purpose, the time of receipt 
will be taken to be the time (as determined by the timestamp applied to the message by the CREST Applications Host) from which 
Link Asset Services is able to retrieve the message by enquiry to CREST in the manner prescribed by CREST. After this time, any 
change of instructions to proxies appointed through CREST should be communicated to the appointee through other means.
CREST members and, where applicable, their CREST sponsors or voting service providers should note that Euroclear UK & Ireland 
Limited does not make available special procedures in CREST for any particular messages. Normal system timings and limitations 
will therefore apply in relation to the input of CREST Proxy Instructions. It is the responsibility of the CREST member concerned to 
take (or, if the CREST member is a CREST personal member or sponsored member or has appointed a voting service provider(s), 
to procure that his or her CREST sponsor or voting service provider(s) take(s)) such action as shall be necessary to ensure that a 
message is transmitted by means of the CREST system by any particular time. In this connection, CREST members and, where
