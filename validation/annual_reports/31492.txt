Our acquisition timeline
Having developed a multi-brand platform, the Group is looking to grow further through the acquisition of additional 
significant franchise networks or companies offering specialist property-related services from which our franchisees 
can benefit. The latter underpinned the rationale of acquiring Brook during 2017.

now offers both sales and lettings 
services and has nationwide coverage.

Chairman’s statement
I am pleased to report that the Belvoir Group has made significant 
progress, increasing profitability by over 60%, in a year that has 
been a testing one for some companies in the property sector.
Performance
Total revenue of £11.3m was underpinned by increases in both MSF 
from lettings and sales of 23% and 21% respectively, with organic 
growth being enhanced by growth from acquisitions and increased 
take-up of property sales by both the Belvoir and Northwood 
networks. This is a testament to the resilience of the business 
format franchising model and the responsiveness of this model to 
changing markets. In the face of uncertainty from the introduction 
of new regulations, our franchisees have risen to the challenge with 
many seeing growth through portfolio acquisition opportunities at a 
local level and pursuing new revenue streams, such as property sales 
and financial services, as a means to securing their long-term future. 
Strategy
The Board of Belvoir identified financial services as a potential 
growth area for the Group, and in July 2017 acquired Brook 
as an excellent vehicle for maximising our return from individual 
property transactions through the sale of specialist mortgage 
and property-related financial services. I would like to take this 
opportunity to welcome Michelle Brook and her team to the 
Belvoir Group. Brook is already working closely with all 39 Newton 
Fallowell offices and, with 25 Belvoir and six Northwood offices 
already on board, I have every confidence in their ability to roll out 
their financial services offering across the other Group networks.
At the Group level, we continue in our aim to extend our share of 
the UK property market by leveraging our expertise as a franchisor, 
as we see a genuine benefit to all stakeholders from further 
consolidation within the sector. We firmly believe that Belvoir is 
best placed to take advantage of consolidation at both the franchisee 
and franchisor level. Furthermore, the Board is committed to 
broadening the range of property services offered by our franchisees, 
building on their reputation for delivering a highly professional 
lettings and estate agency service throughout the customer 
property journey.
Experienced management team 
delivering significant progress
2017 marked 21 years of uninterrupted 
profit growth for the Belvoir Group.
Senior management
As Chairman, I am especially pleased with the strength and depth of 
our senior team, from the main Board Directors to the management 
teams of our various trading subsidiaries, Belvoir, Northwood, 
Newton Fallowell and Brook, all of whom are long serving and 
very capable. These dedicated teams have been instrumental in 
doubling the number and value of transactions under the Assisted 
Acquisitions programme, successfully integrating the Northwood 
network to deliver a 58% increase in its EBITDA within 19 months, 
and starting the process of cross-selling financial services to the whole 
Group through Brook. In addition we have recently completed our 
planned programme to franchise all but the two original Grantham-
based Belvoir and Newton Fallowell corporate offices, enabling us 
to focus entirely on the further development of our franchise model. 
Growth
Our headline figures reflect how successfully the Belvoir Group 
has performed in 2017. Revenue increased by 14% to £11.3m 
(2016: £9.9m), operating profit of £3.9m (2016: £2.5m) is an increase 
of 56%, profit before tax of £3.9m (2016: £2.4m) is up 62%, and there 
has been a 28% improvement in the adjusted earnings per share 
(EPS) to 11.3p (2016: 8.8p). These figures reflect a full year of 
Northwood and a part-year contribution from Brook but nevertheless 
they are significant and have encouraged us to increase our dividend 
to 6.9p per share, showing our confidence in the strength of the 
Group to continue to deliver on its growth strategy.
Board changes
Finally, we say farewell to Nicholas Leeming as a Non-Executive 
Director and the Chairman of the Remuneration Committee. 
Nicholas has been with us for over five years, having joined just 
after Belvoir floated on AIM, and in that time he has brought a wealth 
of experience and wisdom to the Board. I would like to thank him 
for his valuable contribution and wish him the very best for the future. 
At the same time we welcome Michael Stoop to the Board. Michael 
has over 40 years’ experience of the franchise property market, 
having held the role of group managing director initially at Winkworth, 
then at Legal and General’s estate agency network, Xperience, 
where he was instrumental in converting the corporate-owned 
offices into a wholly franchised network of 95 offices, and most 
recently at the Property Franchise Group plc until he stood down 
in 2016. I am confident that with his background and experience 
Michael will make a valuable contribution to the Group’s strategy.
Mike Goddard
Chairman
“ Looking to the future I have every confidence 
in the success of our franchise business model 
which, having flourished historically in all phases

the current changing market conditions.” 05 Annual report and accounts 2017 Belvoir Lettings plc
Chief Executive Officer’s statement
To what extent will online estate agencies threaten 
the traditional estate and lettings agency business? 
Traditional estate agents, as opposed to exclusively online 
estate agency businesses, handle over 90% of property 
transactions in the UK. Vendors, especially landlords, continue 
to value the local expertise and cost effectiveness available 
across our network of offices. 
Online agents have succeeded in lowering the public’s expectation 
of how much they should be paying for estate agency services. 
As a relatively new entrant to estate agency, downward pressure 
on fees has not negatively impacted our business and in fact, 
having adjusted for the full year impact of Northwood, we are 
still 10% up year on year on MSF from estate agency.
What impact do you see Brexit having on the 
property market? 
There has been no discernible impact from the transition 
towards Brexit. Whilst during 2017 a slow down in the property 
market was anticipated, the number of property transactions 
remained surprisingly stable and was only 1% down year on year 
and changes in our business model has meant that network 
revenue from estate agency increased. In our opinion the reason 
that property transactions remained stable in 2017 was due to 
two main factors: supply and demand, and access to relatively 
cheap mortgage lending.
There continues to be a shortage of suitable housing within the 
UK for either home ownership or to rent, and given that EU 
nationals currently living in the UK will have the same residency 
rights after Brexit, there is no foreseeable reduction in the 
current level of demand for housing. So, whilst any uncertainty 
could have a short-term impact, the longer-term dynamics 
remain the same.
Do you think the upcoming ban on tenancy fees 
is the right solution to make renting more secure 
for tenants? 
No. It has been widely commented on in the press that the tenancy 
fee ban will simply increase the cost of renting for many tenants. 
There are a number of Government consultations happening 
as we speak, as policy makers recognise the importance of the 
private rented sector (PRS). It is likely that with the introduction 
of redress for tenants from DIY landlords, licensing for agents and 
the possibility of longer tenancies, standards of accommodation 
are likely to increase and encourage more people to use a 
well-functioning PRS, similar to other European countries. 
Do you expect the size of the PRS to increase 
or decrease in the next ten years?
The PRS will undoubtedly continue to grow, both in terms 
of the number of properties in the PRS and also the number 
of properties in the social housing sector.

What changes might encourage private landlords 
to use a lettings agent?
Increased regulation around property letting and licensing 
for both agents and landlords is likely to make the prospect 
of renting property without the involvement of a fully qualified 
agent less attractive. Recent proposals that private landlords 
should be subject to a redress scheme, as is already applicable 
to lettings agents, will add to the risk and cost profile for private 
landlords such that the negatives of managing their portfolio 
themselves will start to outweigh the positives.
How does the volatility of house prices affect Belvoir? 
As far as the rental sector is concerned, Belvoir has traded 
successfully, delivering year-on-year growth since 1995, during 
which time house prices have both fallen, as in the period between 
2007 and 2010, and risen well above general inflation, as during 
the late 1990s and early 2000s. 
As far as estate agency is concerned, during a period where prices 
are falling typically the number of transactions also falls as sellers 
are less willing to sell their property at a lower price, or at a loss, 
and this will impact on estate agents. However, if properties are 
more difficult to sell, vendors are more likely to use a proactive 
local estate agent to ensure they get the best price possible.
Do you expect to see more or fewer lettings agents 
in the future? 
We predict that the number of lettings agencies will reduce by 
20% in the next three years. There are simply too many estate 
and lettings agents in the UK, which we see as a significant 
opportunity for a network of our strength. Since 2014 our 
Assisted Acquisitions programme has enabled 44 franchised 
businesses across all of our networks to grow their businesses 
and increase their market share by acquiring their competition.

Chief Executive Officer’s statement continued
Capitalising on opportunities 
as the industry evolves
In a changing market, our franchise network benefits 
from the agility of franchise owners coupled with a central 
support system to give us an edge over both the large 
corporate networks and small independent operators.
MSF growth 
Management service fees (MSF) increased by 23% to £7.9m 
(2016: £6.4m). These fees are collected by each network as a 
royalty for providing a brand, a system and the considerable 
know-how for a franchisee to operate a profitable business at local 
office level. The increase in MSF reflects growth across our existing 
network of offices and a full year’s contribution from Northwood. 
Lettings 
Like Belvoir, Northwood has a strong lettings background which 
is evident in lettings now representing 80% (2016: 76%) of our 
network revenue, providing a reliable and recurring income from 
a nationwide portfolio of 58,020 (2016: 55,576) rented properties. 
Belvoir’s Rental Index for the final quarter of 2017 confirms that rents 
are rising broadly in line with average wages. Belvoir has 300 
offices nationwide and data for those offices that have traded 
consistently over the last nine years in England, Wales and Scotland 
indicate a year-on-year (YoY) increase in average rents of 2% from 
£744 in Q4 2016 to £759 in Q4 2017 whereas average earnings 
increased 2.5% YoY according to ONS figures
1
. Average rents including 
all Belvoir offices range from £597 per month in the North West 
(down 5% YoY), up to £657 in the East Midlands (up 6% YoY) and 
through to £1,046 in the South East (up 7% YoY) and £1,431 in London 
(down 5% YoY).
Property sales 
Our main estate agency network, Newton Fallowell, achieved a 10% 
growth in revenue from property sales whilst the lettings-biased 
networks, Belvoir and Northwood-branded offices, saw property 
sales MSF increase by 47% and 7% respectively. The ability of our 
traditional lettings agents to be able to process property sales is 
critical to retaining the ongoing portfolio of managed properties, 
with most landlords looking first to sell through their lettings agent. 
Where the new owner is a landlord buyer, there is a strong probability 
of retaining the vast majority of their properties under management. 
Financial services
Financial services were identified as a means of increasing the 
return from property sales that would benefit both franchisee and 
franchisor. The acquisition of Brook represented an opportunity to 
bring into the Group a very successful business with a track record 
in the financial services sector. The Board believes that the focused 
approach operated by Brook will enable the Group to achieve 
materially greater penetration of Belvoir’s client base and increase 
the financial services fees generated on property sales across all 
Group networks. As our lettings-biased networks, Belvoir and 
Northwood, grow their property sales business, Brook will enable 
our brands to increase further their revenue from estate agency-
related services and mitigate some of the impact of the upcoming 
ban on tenant fees. Additionally, Brook will be able to make 
immediate inroads into the Group’s main estate agency network, 
Newton Fallowell, by increasing the available number of mortgage 
advisors to service its substantial house sales transactions.
Acquisitions
2017 saw a record number of portfolio acquisitions at a franchisee 
level under the Assisted Acquisitions programme, a core part of the 
Group’s growth strategy. The Board’s target of doubling the number of 
transactions under this programme was significantly exceeded with 23 
(2016: nine) independent agencies being acquired. These acquisitions 
were undertaken by one Newton Fallowell, eight Belvoir and 14 
Northwood franchisees and added £3.3m (2016: £1.5m) to network 
revenue, 2,264 managed properties and £351,000 (2016: £243,000) 
p.a. in MSF. 
There remain over 10,000 potential acquisition targets comprising 
small to medium-sized independent lettings and sales agents in the 
UK, which might look to exit following increased regulation and the 
prospect of the ban on tenant fees in 2019. Our dedicated in-house 
acquisitions team currently has 73 franchises registered on the Assisted 
Acquisitions programme and 17 opportunities under consideration.
A growing business 
Our growth depends directly on the entrepreneurial drive of our 
franchisees and, unlike many franchise offerings, our model offers 
our franchisees both a revenue stream from their business and a 
capital value on exit. In order to maximise our growth potential, we 
have recently launched a new strategy to enable existing franchisees 
to expand into an adjacent empty territory. Franchisees can appoint 
a suitable business partner to work the new territory from home 
as a satellite of their existing franchise office which would provide 
all back office support. The focus will be on establishing a reliable 
revenue stream within the first three years, after which a high street 
office would be opened in the new territory to ensure that the 
business could fulfil its maximum growth potential. Our successful 
strategy of growing our network organically with single and 
multi-unit operators and by acquisition continues to evolve to 
ensure we improve our physical footprint and brand awareness.
Corporate offices
In 2016 the Board determined to implement a franchise solution 
for eight of its ten corporate-owned offices, retaining the two 
original Grantham-based Belvoir and Newton Fallowell offices, 
both of which are very profitable, to be used for system development 
purposes. This process is now complete, with four offices having 
been sold in 2016, two in 2017 and the final two in the first quarter 
of 2018. Of these, three were sold to adjacent franchisees, two to the 
existing branch manager, and three to a new franchise owner. In 
one case the new owner was already operating two existing lettings 
businesses, which will now be rebranded to Belvoir. The Board 
sees this as a way of bringing fresh impetus to these offices and 
freeing the Board to focus on the Group’s franchising operations. 07 Annual report and accounts 2017 Belvoir Lettings plc
Acquisition strategy
Having raised £5.0m through equity in 2013 to fund the Assisted Acquisitions 
programme, we have since provided both commercial and financial support to 45 
of our franchisees, many of whom have doubled the size of their business overnight 
through a portfolio acquisition. Each year between £0.7m and £1.0m is repaid by 
franchisees which is then available to fund further portfolio acquisitions, and around 
£0.3m is received in interest on the loan book. The success of our franchisees in 
securing alternative funding means that each year we have been able to support 
a larger number of transactions from the same funding base. The Board has once 
again doubled the Assisted Acquisitions target and so far in 2018 has completed 
on eight transactions totalling £3.3m, which will bring in £2.8m of network revenue 
and 2,238 managed properties.
Compliance 
The Belvoir Group has built its reputation by delivering a highly 
professional lettings and estate agency service which embraces 
the principles of specialism, quality and customer care. Compliance 
is at the top of our agenda with all franchisees undergoing a training 
programme and ongoing business support and every office being 
audited annually to ensure strict adherence to our high operational 
standards and current legislation. This is increasingly important as 
the Government looks to professionalise the PRS sector through 
greater regulation and control. The Board welcomes the Government’s 
initiatives that we believe will deter rogue landlords and agents.
Market conditions
The size of the PRS in the UK has been steadily increasing for 
over a decade, resulting in the PRS representing 20% of the total 
households. A lack of affordable housing, static wages and indeed 
personal choice are causing the PRS to cater for a wider reaching 
demographic including families, professionals and even retirees. 
For this reason the PRS is evolving, the average tenancy is now just 
under four years and many people are turning to lettings, looking 
for their long-term stable home. In line with these changes, tenants 
are expecting a much higher standard of property and service 
from their agent meaning a reputable, professional agent is more 
important than ever for landlords to attract the right tenant. 
Impacting on this shift is the added increase in regulation of the 
lettings industry imposed by the Government. These changes are 
already leading to consolidation in the lettings market as smaller 
independent agents look to exit, leaving market share for our 
franchisees to capitalise on either organically or directly through 
our Assisted Acquisitions programme. 
Some of the changes in our industry such as the upcoming ban 
on tenant fees will certainly be a challenge for our business but 
robust plans have been in place ever since the ban was announced 
to give franchisees additional opportunities such as property sales 
to mitigate the loss in revenue. 
The sales market in the UK has been fairly uneventful with unchanged 
transaction numbers and a modest increase in house prices of 
5.2% during 2017. This result was more positive than anticipated 
though and was probably due to supply and demand with net 
migration exceeding the number of new builds completed in 2017. 
The Group’s performance in property sales was very positive in 
2017 with an increase in MSF of 21%. Our relatively small reliance 
on the property sales market and the fact that the majority of our 
franchisees are offering sales as an additional service alongside a 
very stable lettings business mean there is only really upside for 
us with property sales. The acquisition of Brook also helped us 
build on this opportunity, as franchisees can generate additional 
revenue from each house sale whilst offering their clients a more 
comprehensive property service. 
Franchising 
In 2016 the British Franchising Association and NatWest jointly 
reported that the franchising industry was estimated to be worth 
£15.1bn to the UK economy, an increase of 46% over the last 
ten years. The increasing popularity of franchising was linked 
to the greater chance of financial success with a record 97% of 
franchisee-owned units reported profitability, with 56% saying 
they are “quite” or “very” profitable. Franchising offers a relatively 
low risk way for young people to get into business with one in five 
franchise owners launching their business in the last two years 
being under the age of 30. It also offers opportunity for scale 
with 29% of franchises running multiple outlets.
Current trading and outlook 
2018 has started well with eight franchisees having completed 
on portfolio acquisitions estimated to bring in a total of £2.8m p.a. 
of additional network revenue, taking the Group to 42% of our 
2018 target within Q1. Furthermore, despite the anticipated slow 
down in house sales, our main estate agency network, Newton 
Fallowell, has reported on both sales subject to contract and its 
pipeline being ahead of 2017. Our investment in Brook to deliver a 
planned increase in revenue from financial services is proving to 
be a success with the value of mortgages written and net banking 
up 30% through a combination of a greater number of mortgages 
being written, a higher penetration from life policies and an increased 
average case value on the same period last year. We do anticipate 
some tempering of the underlying organic growth of the lettings 
market with YoY average rent increases reported at 2% in Q4 2017 
and evidence of slightly longer void periods between tenancies 
in some regions. However, given the shortfall of properties available 
to buy continuing to fuel demand within the PRS and the additional 
legislative demands on both lettings agents and private landlords 
seeing an increase in the need for a qualified, well-supported 
agent, we believe that our franchisees are in a good position to 
capitalise on the opportunities within the sector and anticipate 
a further year of positive growth for the Belvoir Group.

changes within the sector and welcome 
the professionalisation of our industry 
as an opportunity not a threat.” 08 Belvoir Lettings plc Annual report and accounts 2017
Our business model
A formula for success
Our franchise model is built on 23 years of 
experience, the entrepreneurial drive and local 
knowledge of our franchisees, and the support 
and guidance of our Central Office team.
Our difference 
Service excellence
Our experience and focus on customer service has 
enabled us to stand out from the crowd and is key to the 
success of our Group. Our intensive training and annual 
audit further support this to ensure our franchisees are 
equipped to deliver the standards we require.
Greater financial stability
A strong lettings base coupled with a growing revenue 
stream from property sales provide our franchisees and the 
Group as a whole with greater financial stability compared to 
a typical estate agency. Our model also enables franchisees 
to build a capital asset which, unlike income-based 
franchise options, provides a financial return on exit.
The franchise network
Our franchisees benefit from the backup and support 
associated with a large franchise operation whilst 
operating their own business with the entrepreneurial 
drive of an owner–manager. 
Proactive growth
We proactively identify suitable businesses for our 
franchisees to bolt onto their existing business, whilst 
also initiating the roll out of additional property services 
to be offered by our franchisees, providing the opportunity 
for accelerated and sustained growth.
Our process
Fees
New franchisees pay an upfront fee to cover the licence for 
their exclusive territory and our induction training. An ongoing 
monthly management service fee, based on franchise revenue, 
covers the cost of our mentoring programme and contributes 
towards Central Office operations and further investment 
in the business.
Brand equity
Our brands are highly regarded and respected for their 
core values of professionalism and customer service. We 
invest continually in our brands to ensure that messaging 
remains fresh and relevant to our markets.
Networking
We facilitate a culture where franchisees learn from each 
other and share experiences through both national and 
regional networking groups and at the annual conference 
held by each network.  09 Annual report and accounts 2017 Belvoir Lettings plc

Selection
We work closely with potential new franchisees to ensure 
that they are a good fit for our business model of high 
quality service delivery and sound business ethics. This 
process minimises the risk to both the franchisor and the 
franchisees and assures our high success rate. 
Support
Each franchisee has a dedicated business mentor who 
helps them to develop their business. Advice and support 
is available from Central Office in specialist areas such as 
legal, IT, compliance and marketing.
Training
New franchisees undertake an intensive training course 
prior to opening. Continual professional training and 
development is conducted both at Central Office 
and via webinars.

Our people
People are the most important factor in any business but even more so in sales and lettings. When dealing 
with a person’s most valued possession, trust, confidence and communication are of paramount importance 
to delivering the service the customer expects. Our business could not thrive without exceptional franchisees 
who exceed their customers’ expectations and grasp the opportunities that come their way.
At the heart of our business
We recognise the need to attract, train, reward and 
retain highly motivated staff and franchisees to deliver 
a professional and exceptional service. 
Stephen Summerhayes of Northwood Norwich 
and Ipswich
Cold start, resale and acquisition
Stephen is a long-standing Northwood franchisee having owned 
Northwood Norwich for 14 years, during which time he has 
built up his lettings portfolio to 690 managed and guaranteed 
rent properties. Stephen’s first acquisition was over five years 
ago for 80 properties, and the largest, in December 2017, was 
for 300 properties. 
Also in 2017 Stephen decided to acquire a second territory 
through the resale of the Northwood Ipswich office, which had 
a portfolio of 200 properties. Stephen is now looking to expand 
this further through acquisition.
The growth by acquisition in the last five years has seen Stephen’s 
business grow by 60% in size with turnover more than doubling.
“I realised that acquisition was more cost effective than advertising 
for organic growth. I decided to focus on acquisition and have 
completed five portfolio purchases in as many years. As a result 
I have grown twice as fast in the last five years than I did in the 
previous ten. Only through acquisition could this have been possible.”
Laura Mearns of Northwood Aberdeen
Cold start and two acquisitions
Laura and her husband, Steven, opened Northwood Aberdeen in 
2008. Trading in Aberdeen has been extremely tough in 2017 due 
to long-term falling oil prices dramatically changing the dynamic 
of this unusual city. The difficult trading conditions presented 
opportunities which Laura has fully taken advantage of, with two 
acquisitions in quick succession in November 2017 bringing over 
300 additional managed properties to Northwood Aberdeen. To make 
her achievement even more impressive, this was all done just after 
Laura had just given birth to the couple’s third child. 
“2017 was an exciting year for Northwood Aberdeen. As the rental 
market experienced a huge shift in rental values following the oil 
crisis and, in addition, as significant legislative changes were being 
faced, it was an opportunity for us to consolidate with other agents 
during this period. This growth is really exciting for Northwood. 
However, it is important to highlight that, although we have grown 
the portfolio, we continue to be a small, family run, local business, 
ensuring our landlords and tenants receive a personal service.” 11 Annual report and accounts 2017 Belvoir Lettings plc
Clayton Foston of Belvoir Hinckley and Nuneaton, 
Tamworth and Burton
Cold start, resale and acquisition
Clayton Foston joined Belvoir in 2011, when he purchased a cold 
start office in Nuneaton and Hinckley. In 2014 he was one of the 
first franchisees to benefit from the Assisted Acquisitions programme 
when acquiring a local lettings portfolio. Subsequently Clayton 
joined forces with two new business partners in order to purchase 
Belvoir Tamworth as a resale in 2016. In 2017 Clayton took over 
the previous corporate-owned office in Burton and made a 
significant acquisition comprising 293 managed properties and 
200 let-only properties. He is currently embarking on further 
grand plans for his existing Nuneaton and Hinckley business.
Clayton is a very progressive franchisee and fully appreciates that 
a successful business must evolve and develop in order to remain 
relevant. A new shopping centre in Clayton’s territory is about to 
change the dynamic of the traditional town centre, and rather 
than waiting and seeing what impact a lack of footfall will have 
on his business, Clayton is taking an unusual approach for a high 
street lettings and estate agent and is moving his business to the 
shopping centre to make the most of the opportunity. Clayton is 
looking to maximise this opportunity even further by working with 
the Belvoir Central Office to create a new, updated version of the 
Belvoir shop fit that is vibrant and modern and fully embraces 
technology. He is also creating a one-stop-shop for customers, 
incorporating a MAB mortgage advisor and a range of other 
services to help make his new office a destination for Nuneaton 
and Hinckley’s property needs.
“Traditional lettings and estate agency must adapt to meet new 
challenges in the sector as the disruptors such as Purplebricks have 
clearly shaken up the market. For me, differentiating myself from all 
of the numerous agents in town is an essential part of this evolution, 
with premises designed to meet the challenges of the next decade 
in a location of high footfall where we can showcase new 
innovations and ideas.”
Employees
Belvoir believes that employee engagement and human capital 
management is key to ensuring that we have the necessary team 
to deliver future success. In order to attract and retain professional 
staff with the requisite skill, Belvoir invests in a high level of employee 
engagement through regular staff reviews setting out and monitoring 
performance against an agreed personal development plan. We also 
invest in professional training to enable our employees to develop 
in their roles. We currently have seven members of staff undertaking 
professional qualifications, encompassing lettings, accountancy 
and project management. This includes the sponsorship of two 
very successful accounting apprentices taking their AAT exams 
within the Group finance team.
Accounting apprentice Catalyn wins two local awards
In 2017 accounting apprentice Catalyn Bavister, who works in the 
Belvoir Group finance department, won both the Grantham College 
Advanced Accounting Apprentice of the Year award and the 
Grantham Journal Apprentice of the Year award.
Catalyn was nominated for the Grantham Journal award by Chief 
Financial Officer, Louise George: “Catalyn is a perfect example of 
how the apprenticeship qualification provides young people with 
the opportunity to achieve their ambitions and potential given the 
right mix of academic and work-based experience and support. 
She has grown in confidence over the last year and we look 
forward to supporting her professional development and future 
career progression at Belvoir.”
Catalyn was ecstatic with her success, stating: “I was over the 
moon! It was a great feeling just to have been nominated and I am 
so very proud to have won.” Catalyn believes that the apprenticeship 
was the right path for her to take: “I get to both earn and learn 
at the same time, gaining a professional qualification in a 
well regarded company.”
Catalyn has recently progressed onto level 4 of the Accounting 
Technician (AAT) exams. Her original purchase ledger role has been 
taken on by the latest addition to the finance team; accounting 
apprentice Adam Egner, who is working towards his level 2 AAT 
exams and has a 100% record on both exams taken to date. 12 Belvoir Lettings plc Annual report and accounts 2017
Our markets
2017 was very much a continuation from the year before for the property market with economic 
uncertainty resulting in flat transaction rates for sales although our own performance within this 
sector has remained positive. The upcoming ban on tenant fees, together with the likelihood of 
greater regulation within the lettings market, has brought challenges to our industry but also 
opportunity through increasing consolidation.
Ever increasing importance of the lettings market
Tenure type rising
The latest English Housing Survey
1
 for 2016–2017 demonstrates 
the continuing increased reliance in the UK on the PRS, which 
now represents 4.7 million households, 13 million people, or 20% 
of the total households. In London, this is more significant with 
30% of households now privately renting.
Looking at the demographic detail behind this trend, those in 
the age groups of 25–34 and 35–44 seem to be the biggest cause 
of this shift. The decline in home ownership has been particularly 
pronounced for these age groups, leading to a significant increase in 
the PRS for that same group. In 2006–2007, 38% of the 25–44 age 
group were privately renting, which increased to 75% in 2016–2017.
Growth in the PRS for this key age group in particular is likely to be 
for various reasons. With the deposit needed from first-time buyers 
averaging £48,591 (mean), affordability is likely to be a major factor 
in this shift away from home ownership. Also, an increasing number 
of people are choosing to rent as the freedom that comes without 
being tied to a mortgage better suits their lifestyle. The need for 
flexible or temporary accommodation is also prevalent for groups 
such as professionals, students and migrants.
The housing market and how 
we are responding to it
With a lack of affordable housing and average wages down 
in real terms, the private rented sector (PRS) continues to grow 
as households decide to rent rather than buy.

The changing face of the “typical” tenant
The information presented overleaf demonstrates the changing 
face of today’s tenant. As a result the PRS is becoming increasingly 
important for families as well as single households. With regard to 
renters’ economic status, 74% of private renters were working, 
with 63% in full-time work and 11% in part-time work. In addition, 
9% of private renters were retired, 6% were in full-time education 
and 4% were unemployed. 
The average length of tenure for private renters remains unchanged 
at 3.9 years, showing that many renters are looking for a long-term, 
stable home.
Our own analysis: ten years of the Belvoir Rental Index
In 2008, Belvoir started producing its Rental Index based on data 
from the Belvoir network, gathered and analysed quarterly by an 
independent party. This Rental Index is one of the longest running 
of its kind and crucially one of the few to pre-date the property 
market crash of 2008/2009. The Belvoir Rental Index, taken 
together with other industrywide data, gives us a more accurate 
picture of the industry within which we operate and enables us 
to make more informed business decisions as a result.
Our data shows that rents are increasing but at a slow, steady and 
sustainable rate. The average rent for the Belvoir network in 2017 
was £798, which is 2% up on the average rent charged in 2016. 
Rental increases have stalled during 2017 which is possibly due 
to an increase in negative focus on our industry to support 
upcoming changes in Government legislation.

Government-led initiatives and their potential effect on the lettings industry
The last few years have seen a marked increase in the rules and 
regulations introduced to our industry. These changes include 
stricter health and safety regulations, and the additional administrative 
tasks associated with identifying the eligibility of a tenant to live in 
the UK as part of Right to Rent. Reputable lettings agents will usually 
carry the burden of this extra work for their landlords and as such 
we expect to see more private landlords start to enlist the services 
of a lettings agent. A recent announcement by Communities 
Secretary, Sajid Javid
2
, detailed proposals for potentially introducing 
compulsory membership for private landlords to a consumer redress 
scheme which would also encompass certain additional regulations 
to adhere to. This would further improve a tenant’s experience of the 
PRS ensuring they receive adequate support in a dispute regardless 
of who they rent from. This would also help to level the playing 
field between lettings agents and private landlords, making it 
even more beneficial for a landlord to use a lettings agent.
The 2016 announcement of the proposed ban on tenant fees is 
probably the biggest challenge for our industry. Although not due 
to come into force until 2019, the impending ban has forced letting 
agents to rethink their business plans and income streams in order 
to offset the costs associated with carrying out the necessary 
checks and administrative tasks associated with placing a tenant. 
For some agents this cost may be passed onto the landlord, some 
may need to increase the rent charged to the tenant and some 
may be able to find new opportunities or efficiencies within their 
own business in order to absorb the additional cost.
Our response
The PRS clearly has an important role to play in providing homes 
for an ever increasing section of the UK population. With long 
average tenancies and fair steady growth in rents, tenants can feel 
secure in their home and the PRS can continue to remain 
profitable for lettings agents and landlords. 
Increased regulation for landlords can only help to make the PRS 
a more reliable sector for tenants. Banning of tenant fees, while 
less favourable in our opinion than a cap on fees, will help to rid 
the PRS of less reputable lettings agents who may have abused 
this revenue stream in the past. Ultimately a safer, fairer, more 
transparent PRS can only be a good thing for the perception 
of our industry as a whole. 
Some smaller, independent lettings agents without the support of a 
national brand, legal expertise and business development planning 
are now struggling to maintain a profitable business. This is leading 
to continued consolidation in our industry, which is creating more 
opportunities for our franchisees to buy competitors’ lettings 
portfolios to add to their existing businesses.

Market case study
The upcoming tenant fee ban has been a concern 
for our franchisees and we have estimated that our 
network revenue could be affected by around 13%. 
As with all setbacks in business, the level of impact is 
somewhat controllable if you evolve and develop in other 
ways to compensate. Our Belvoir Doncaster franchisee, 
Chris Duffy, is a prime example of this. Six months ago Chris 
decided to get ahead of the upcoming ban on tenant fees 
and started to work on a series of changes in an attempt 
to mitigate any future loss in revenue.
Through moving to a more cost-effective business premises, 
upgrading some of his technology for greater efficiency, 
improving his processes and putting more emphasis on 
selling the best level of insurance products to his landlords 
and tenants, Chris has completely compensated for all loss in 
tenant fees when the ban comes into place meaning Chris 
will go forward with a better performing, more efficient 
business as a result.

The importance of estate agency for the Group
With our Belvoir and Northwood networks being relative newcomers 
to estate agency, this market still represents more of an opportunity 
than a risk to us. Despite a challenging sales market in 2017, as a 
Group, our network revenue from sales increased by 20% yet, as 
shown in the graph below, sales still represents only 20% of our 
total revenue meaning there is still the potential to increase 
this further. 
The acquisition of Brook in July 2017 also presents an opportunity 
for increased revenue from sales once integrated into our franchisees’ 
business operations. The existing, smaller Newton Fallowell’s 
mortgage business was transferred into Brook at the start of 2018 
resulting in 29 financial advisors with a target to grow to 50 over 
the next two years. The Brook advisors are already fully supporting 
the Newton Fallowell network and during 2018 will start to integrate 
with the Belvoir and Northwood networks offering franchisees 
the opportunity to benefit from this additional revenue stream. 
Typically a franchisee will earn around £300 for simply introducing 
a customer with no ongoing costs or charges. This will be an 
extremely welcome addition to its income particularly when 
faced with the probable withdrawal of tenant fees in 2019.

The sales market
Residential property transactions have remained fairly static 
throughout 2017 potentially due to continued economic uncertainty 
and static wages. House prices, however, are still faring well with a 
modest increase of 5.2%
3
 year on year. This is likely due to a simple 
case of supply and demand. Government figures report net migration 
of 244,000
4
 compared to 154,220
5
 new builds completed for the 
year to September 2017, which is only adding to the existing 
housing shortage.
Contrary to elsewhere in the UK, house prices in London actually 
fell for the first time in eight years according to mortgage lender 
Nationwide. House prices in London fell by 0.5%
6
 making it the weakest 
performing region for the first time since 2004 with a greater 
number of people in the capital unable to afford to buy a home. 
The Belvoir Group has been largely immune to the effects of a 
suffering London housing market as our coverage in the capital 
remains low with less than 5% of our franchisees’ revenue derived 
from the London area.

#MovingMemories 
In September Belvoir launched its 
#MovingMemories video campaign, 
an emotive video to capture the 
excitement, stress and occasional 
sadness that a house move can bring. 
Behind every house move there is a 
person with a story to tell, and this is 
something that Belvoir never forgets.

Risk management
Principal risks and uncertainties
The Board has determined the most significant risks to achieving 
the business objectives, including those that would threaten its 
business model, future performance, solvency or liquidity. The 
table opposite summarises these principal risks and how they are 
managed or mitigated. The risks listed do not comprise all those 
associated with the Group and are not set out in any order of 
priority. There could be additional risks and uncertainties, which 
are not presently known to management or currently deemed 
to be less material, which may also have an adverse effect on 
the business.
Going concern statement
The Group’s business model as set out on pages 8 and 9 has proved 
to be a robust and successful model for over 23 years. The Group’s 
corporate strategy has been clearly set out to investors since 
flotation in 2012 and has resulted in Belvoir becoming the largest 
franchise property group within the UK. We continue to open new 
agencies across the UK and to support growth by assisting our 
franchisees to make local portfolio acquisitions and by making 
corporate-level acquisitions of other property franchise networks and 
property services-related companies. The Group has demonstrated 
strong growth from a mixture of like-for-like and acquisition-based 
growth as evidenced by increasing revenue and profitability over 
many years.
At the year end, the Group had cash at bank of £1.4m and a bank 
term loan of £6.5m. On 28 March 2017, the Group entered into 
new banking arrangements with HSBC which included a £12.0m 
loan facility and a £5.0m accordion facility to replace the existing 
lending by NatWest and to provide further access to funds to 
support Group growth plans.
Based on their assessment of prospects and viability above, the 
Directors confirm that they have a reasonable expectation that the 
Group will be able to continue in operation and meet its liabilities 
as they fall due.

Our risk management framework
How we manage risk
As with all businesses, we face a wide range of risks 
and uncertainties on a daily basis. 19 Annual report and accounts 2017 Belvoir Lettings plc
Nature of risk and impact Potential impact Mitigating activities
Ability to generate 
planned revenue 
and profit growth
 
No change
There is no certainty that the Group will continue to 
expand its share of the residential property market 
through organic growth or by acquisition. The Group 
derives its main source of income from its MSF chargeable 
at a percentage of franchise network revenue. This 
depends upon market conditions and the willingness 
of landlords to pay commission to lettings agents and 
of vendors to pay commission for a traditional estate 
agency service. Our forecast growth relies on the 
continued commercial success of our franchisees 
to outperform the underlying market growth and to 
diversify their property-related service offering in what 
is a highly competitive residential property market. 
The risks are mitigated by the Board regularly monitoring 
the revenue from the MSF and the Group management 
accounts, and taking the appropriate action when variances 
are identified. Given that some of the risk arises due to 
extraneous factors, there may be limits to the level of 
direct action that can be taken. However, the Board does 
prioritise the work of the business development mentors, 
who work closely with franchisees to target and address 
how they grow their business and respond to market 
conditions. Furthermore, the Board identifies additional 
property-related services and supports the roll out of 
such new services to franchisees.
Ability to recruit and 
retain skilled 
franchisees
 
Risk increased
The ability of the Group to attract new franchisees 
with the appropriate expertise and skills, in available 
and suitable locations, cannot be guaranteed. Given 
the prevailing market conditions, the Group may 
experience difficulties in finding appropriate 
franchisees and failure to do so would have a 
detrimental effect upon trading performance. 
The Board continually monitors the performance of 
the recruitment team and is focused on identifying 
innovative ways of attracting successful new 
franchise owners.
Reputational risk to 
the franchise model
 
No change
The Group’s reputation, in terms of the service it and 
its franchisees provide, the way in which it and its 
franchisees conduct their business, and the financial 
results which they achieve are central to the Group’s 
future success. Failure by the franchisees to meet the 
expectations of their landlords, tenants, buyers and 
sellers may have a material impact on the reputation 
of the brands within the Group.
The franchisees join subject to an intensive training 
programme and subsequent monitoring and support 
from a dedicated business development mentor. The 
Group also offers ongoing training courses to ensure 
continuing professional development.
Ability to execute 
the Belvoir Assisted 
Acquisitions strategy
 
Risk decreased
The Group needs to continue to identify suitable 
acquisition targets for its franchisees through its 
Assisted Acquisitions programme and to be able to 
support the franchisee to fund the acquisition through 
both third party and Belvoir lending. The competitive 
process in the marketplace might increase the acquisition 
price and the tight lending criteria of major lenders 
might limit resources available to our network. 
The Board monitors the Assisted Acquisitions programme 
to target a return on investment in excess of 25%. Belvoir 
saw acquisition activity double in 2017 and only provided 
10% of the deal value as loans to franchisees. The year 
ended with a strong pipeline of potential acquisitions 
for 2018.
Legislative changes
 
Risk increased
Tax changes on interest relief against buy-to-let 
(BTL) mortgages and higher stamp duty on second 
homes have cooled BTL landlord activity in the market. 
Furthermore, the introduction of a ban on tenant fees, 
now expected in 2019 following a period of consultation, 
has led to uncertainty for both existing and potential 
new franchise owners.
The Board is focused on supporting the network 
in expanding their service offering:
• Property sales still represent a viable new revenue 
stream for our many lettings-based franchise owners.
• A drive to engage with our franchisees on the 
upsale possibilities in the financial services sector 
including the commission on insurances, 
conveyancing and mortgages.
• Local acquisitions to expand their lettings portfolios.
Online threat
 
Risk increased
Online agencies offering a low cost solution are 
likely to increase their market share. The Group needs 
to ensure that it can meet the demands of a new 
generation of landlords, tenants, buyers and sellers 
for whom a technical platform is second nature, and 
for whom a physical office presence is less critical.
The Board is pursuing a strategy of improving the 
customer journey via its traditional agency service 
through a better technology platform to give landlords, 
tenants, buyers and sellers greater online visibility 
and interaction.

Financial review
Revenue
In 2017 Group revenue increased by 14% to £11.3m (2016: £9.9m) 
reflecting the full year’s impact of our 2016 acquisition of Northwood, 
the 2017 acquisition of Brook Financial Services and the franchising 
out of six corporate-owned offices during the two years 
under review.
MSF increased by 23% to £7.9m (2016: £6.4m), of which 17% 
resulted from Northwood being within the Group for twelve months 
(2016: seven). Adjusting for the full year impact of Northwood, 
lettings MSF increased by a further 4.3%, of which 2.7% arose from 
like-for-like growth and 1.6% from portfolio acquisitions by franchisees. 
Meanwhile MSF from property sales increased by 1.6% overall, with 
the main estate agency network, Newton Fallowell, on par with 
last year and growth of 47% and 7% within the lettings-biased 
networks, Belvoir and Northwood, respectively.
Income from corporate-owned offices was down £0.9m as a 
result of the disposal of six Belvoir offices to franchisees between 
August 2016 and March 2017. At the year end there remained four 
corporate-owned offices, of which Cumbria and Spalding have 
since each been acquired by a new franchise owner, leaving the 
two original Grantham offices of Belvoir and Newton Fallowell, 
which are both profitable and will be retained for future 
development purposes.
Revenue from franchise sales in 2017 was £0.3m (2016: £0.4m). 
The Group’s recruitment policy is geared towards bringing on 
new franchise owners via a resale of an existing franchised 
territory or into a “hot start” where a portfolio acquisition is 
executed at the time of opening, so as to give our new franchise 
owners a launch pad. During 2017, we processed five resales and 
one hot start. Meanwhile we saw nine of our existing franchise 
owners open a second office, often as part of a portfolio 
acquisition transaction. 
The acquisition of Brook Financial Services (“Brook”) in July 2017 
has introduced a new reportable revenue stream for the Group 
with Brook adding £0.9m to the £0.3m of financial services 
Significant growth delivered 
from a sound financial platform

our investment and long-term growth strategy.
revenue within the Group to give a total of £1.2m (2016: £0.3m) 
for the year.
Having recognised financial services as a separate revenue stream, 
the 2016 “other income” has been adjusted to extract financial 
services, leaving other income comparable at £0.5m (2016: £0.5m) 
for both years under review.
Operating profit before exceptional items
The £0.4m reduction in non-exceptional administrative expenses 
to £6.5m (2016: £6.9m) reflected a number of underlying factors. 
The full year impact of Northwood, expected to add around 
£0.6m, was considerably mitigated by a restructuring exercise 
carried out in Q1 2017, which eliminated £0.3m from overheads, 
and tighter cost control, resulting in a net increase of £0.2m in the 
Northwood cost base. The July 2017 acquisition of Brook added 
£0.7m to overheads and the franchising out of the six corporate 
offices reduced overheads by £1.2m. 
Within administrative expenses there is a charge of £72,000 
(2016: £25,000) associated with the share options issued to Directors 
and certain staff between 2014 and 2017. Full disclosure is in note 
26 to the accounts.
Operating profit before exceptional items was £3.9m (2016: £2.5m), 
an increase of 56% over the prior year.
Exceptional items
Exceptional items totalled £0.5m (2016: £0.7m), of which £0.1m 
and £0.2m related to legal and professional fees associated with 
the acquisition of Brook and an aborted merger offer respectively, 
and £0.1m represented the deemed interest on the Northwood 
contingent consideration.
Profit before taxation
Profit before taxation of £3.9m (2016: £2.4m) is after interest 
receivable on franchisee loans of £0.3m (2016: £0.3m), which is 
regarded by the Group as part of its ongoing operations to extend 
the network reach.
Taxation
The effective rate of corporate tax for the year was 24.2% 
(2016: 23.9%) due to the £0.3m exceptional legal and professional 
costs of the acquisition and deemed interest not being an allowable 
deduction from profits for tax purposes.
Earnings per share
Basic earnings per share was up 51% to 8.6p (2016: 5.7p) based on 
an average number of shares in issue in the period of 34,638,939 
(2016: 32,375,694), an increase arising from the issue of 803,284 shares 
in January against the Northwood earn-out and 475,162 shares in 
July 2017 against the Brook acquisition. When diluted to incorporate 
1,830,399 (2016: 938,399) share options, the earnings per share 
was 8.1p (2016: 5.5p). 21 Annual report and accounts 2017 Belvoir Lettings plc
Financial position
The Group continues to operate from a sound financial platform 
and is strongly cash generative. This, together with the £1.4m 
opening cash balance, will enable the Group to meet the bank 
loan repayment of £0.7m in 2018. Also, the capital repayments 
from the existing franchisee loan book will enable the Group to 
give further financial assistance to franchisees acquiring local 
managed lettings portfolios, which delivers both network growth 
and favourable rates of return for the Group.
Key performance indicators
The Group uses a number of key financial and non-financial 
performance indicators to measure performance. The Group also 
uses alternative performance measures to improve comparability 
of information between reporting periods and across the sector 
for uncontrollable and one-off factors, which impact upon IFRS 
measures, to aid the users of the annual report in understanding 
the activity taking place across the Group’s portfolio.
The key financial indicators are as follows:
 ∞ management service fees;
 ∞ adjusted net profit before tax; and
 ∞ adjusted earnings per share.
These have been discussed in further detail above.
Following the introduction of property sales to the Belvoir network 
in 2014, the Board started tracking the number of offices offering 
property sales as a KPI. Since the acquisitions of Newton Fallowell, 
Goodchilds and Northwood, all of which were already offering 
sales to varying degrees, and given that the penetration of sales 
within the Belvoir network is now up to over 60%, the number of 
offices offering property sales is no longer deemed to be a key 
determinant of future growth. Meanwhile, the Board is closely 
monitoring the success of the Assisted Acquisitions programme 
as a key part of its strategic growth plans. This change in focus has 
been reflected in the key non-financial indicators listed below:
 ∞ number of offices;
 ∞ managed properties; and
 ∞ additional MSF arising from assisted acquisitions.
These have been discussed in further detail throughout the 
Strategic report and are illustrated on page 22.
Louise George
Chief Financial Officer
“ The successful integration of Northwood 
has demonstrated our capability to manage 
effectively a multi-brand franchise group 
and to deliver increasing profitability.”
Adjusted basic earnings per share of 11.3p (2016: 8.8p) reflects 
adjustments for exceptional administrative costs, profit/(loss) on 
disposal of corporate offices and deemed interest on contingent 
consideration totalling £0.7m. The adjusted diluted earnings per 
share was 10.7p (2016: 8.5p).
The profit attributable to owners was up 67% to £3.0m (2016: £1.8m).
Dividends
The Board is proposing a final dividend for 2017 of 3.5p per share 
(2016: 3.4p). Together with the interim dividend of 3.4p paid to 
shareholders on 27 October 2017, this equates to a total dividend 
for the year of 6.9p per share (2016: 6.8p), a modest increase in 
line with the Board’s progressive dividend policy.
Subject to shareholders’ approval at the AGM on 29 May 2017, the 
dividend will be paid on 31 May 2018 based upon the register on 
20 April 2018. The ex-dividend date will be 19 April 2018. 
Cash flow 
The net cash inflow from operations was £4.6m (2016: £2.9m) 
reflecting the enlarged Group.
The net cash used in investing activities was £0.9m (2016: £9.4m):
 ∞ On 12 July 2017 the Group acquired the entire share capital of 
Brook Financial Services Limited, a specialist mortgage advice 
company, for consideration of £2.2m, of which £1.7m was 
settled in cash and £0.5m by the issue of shares to the vendor.
 ∞ On 2 May 2017 the Group took ownership of the Yardley franchise 
office at a cost of £0.1m. This office, and two existing corporate 
offices, Devizes and Burton, were sold to new franchise owners 
during the year giving rise to a cash inflow of £0.3m (2016: £0.8m) 
on disposal.
 ∞ £0.4m was returned from the Northwood escrow account 
to settle a tax liability.
 ∞ During the year the net inflow from the franchise loan book 
was £0.1m (2016: net outflow of £0.4m).
Loans repaid to the bank in the year were £0.5m (2016: £1.0m) 
and dividend payments totalled £2.4m (2016: £2.2m). As a result, 
net cash outflow from financing activities totalled £3.1m 
(2016: net cash inflow of £5.9m). 
Liquidity and capital resources
At the year end the Group had cash balances of £1.4m (2016: £1.6m) 
and a term loan of £6.5m (2016: £7.0m). The Group entered into 
new banking facilities with HSBC on 28 March 2018. As part of that 
process the year-end NatWest bank loan was settled and a new 
revolving credit facility of £12.0m was put in its place to provide 
the Group with sufficient liquidity to settle the Northwood earn-out 
expected to crystallise in July 2018. The initial drawdown of £7.0m 
under the HSBC facility is repayable in half yearly payments 
of £350,000. 22 Belvoir Lettings plc Annual report and accounts 2017

Introduction to governance
Governance
At Belvoir we recognise that high standards of corporate 
governance underpin our continuing success.
The Directors confirm that:
 ∞ so far as each Director is aware, there is no 
relevant audit information of which the Group 
and Company’s auditor is unaware;
 ∞ the Directors have taken all the steps that they 
ought to have taken as Directors in order to 
make themselves aware of any relevant audit 
information and to establish that the auditor 
is aware of that information; and
 ∞ the Directors are responsible for the maintenance 
and integrity of the corporate and financial information 
included on the Company’s website. Legislation in 
the United Kingdom governing the preparation 
and dissemination of financial statements may differ 
from legislation in other jurisdictions.
We continually review the framework within which we 
operate and the processes implemented to ensure that 
they reflect the complexities of our business and, whilst 
acknowledging our size, are also capable of adding 
value as the business grows. The Company seeks 
guidance as set out in the “Corporate Governance 
Code for Small and Mid-Size Quoted Companies” 
published in 2013 by the Quoted Companies Alliance 
(the “QCA Corporate Governance Code”).
The Board sets out the overall strategic direction for 
Belvoir, regularly reviews management performance 
and ensures that the Group has the right level of 
resources available to support our strategic goals. 
The Board is satisfied that the necessary controls and 
resources are in place such that these responsibilities 
can be properly addressed.
Within Belvoir we promote a culture of good 
governance in dealing with all key stakeholders: 
our franchisees, our employees, our customers and 
our shareholders. This section of the annual report 
describes our corporate governance structures 
and processes and how they have been applied 
throughout the year ended 31 December 2017.

Compliance
The Board ensures that the Company adopts proper standards of 
corporate governance and that the principles of best practice as 
set out in the QCA Corporate Governance Code are followed so 
far as is practicable and appropriate to the size and nature of the 
Company and the constitution of the Board. Set out below is a 
summary of how, at 31 December 2017 and for the year then 
ended, the Company was applying the key requirements of 
the Code.
Board of Directors
Throughout the year the Board comprised a Chairman, three 
Executive Directors and two Non-Executive Directors. At every AGM 
one-third of the Directors must retire by rotation. Notwithstanding 
their small shareholdings, both Non-Executive Directors are 
considered to be independent.
The Board has ten scheduled meetings a year, but meets more 
frequently if required, and has full and timely access to all relevant 
information to enable it to carry out its duties.
The Board reserves for itself a range of key decisions such as 
strategy, acquisitions, significant contracts and internal controls, 
to ensure it retains proper direction and control of the Group, 
whilst delegating authority to individual Directors who are 
responsible for the Executive management of the business.
With effect from July 2017, the roles of Chairman and Chief 
Executive Officer have been separated and are no longer held by 
the same individual. There is a clear division of responsibilities at 
the head of the Company between the running of the Board and 
the running of the Group’s operations.
The role of the Chairman is to manage the Board in the best 
interests of its stakeholders, to ensure that shareholders’ views are 
communicated to the Board and to be responsible for ensuring 
the Board’s integrity and effectiveness.
The role of the Chief Executive Officer is to manage the Group 
on a day-to-day basis, to ensure that Board decisions are 
implemented effectively and to develop and propose Group 
strategy to the Board.
The Board considers the current Board structure appropriate for 
the Company. There are processes in place enabling Directors 
to take independent advice at the Company’s expense in the 
furtherance of their duties and to have access to the advice 
and services of the Company Secretary. 27 Annual report and accounts 2017 Belvoir Lettings plc
Board Committees
The Board has delegated specific responsibilities to the Audit 
and Remuneration Committees. Given its relatively small size, the 
Board as a whole fulfils the function of the Nominations Committee. 
The Board considers that all the members of each Committee 
have the appropriate experience and none of them have interests 
which conflict with their positions on the Committees. All Board 
Committees have their own terms of reference, which are 
available from the Company Secretary upon request.
Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee has two scheduled meetings a year 
and is responsible for determining the contractual terms, remuneration 
and other benefits of the Executive Directors. The Remuneration 
Committee comprised Mike Goddard, Andrew Borkowski and 
Nicholas Leeming, who acted as the Chairman until stepping down 
from the Board on 10 April 2018. Michael Stoop has been appointed 
Chairman of the Remuneration Committee as of 10 April 2018.
Details of the level and composition of the Directors’ remuneration 
are disclosed in the Directors’ remuneration report on pages 28 and 29.
Audit Committee
The Audit Committee has three scheduled meetings a year. The 
Audit Committee comprised Andrew Borkowski, who acted as the 
Chairman, and Nicholas Leeming, until he stepped down from the 
Board on 10 April 2018. Andrew Borkowski is considered to have 
recent and relevant financial and legal knowledge and experience. 
Michael Stoop has been appointed to serve on the Audit Committee 
as of 10 April 2018.
The Audit Committee is responsible for ensuring the integrity of 
the financial statements of the Group and the effectiveness of the 
Group’s underlying internal controls.
The Audit Committee will make recommendations to the Board 
on the appointment, re-appointment and removal of the external 
auditor, taking into account the cost effectiveness, independence 
and objectivity of the external auditor. The Committee meets with 
the external auditor for the purpose of discussing matters relating 
to the financial reporting, accounting policies and internal 
controls of the Group.
During the year the Group’s external auditor provided non-audit 
services to the Group, including tax advice. The fees paid for these 
services are outlined in note 3. The use of the external auditor for 
non-audit work has been carefully evaluated by the Audit Committee 
and was not considered to have impaired the external auditor’s 
independence and objectivity.
Internal control
The Board is responsible for the Company’s system of internal 
control, including financial, operational and compliance controls 
and risk management, and for reviewing its effectiveness. The 
Board has introduced procedures designed to meet the particular 
needs of the Company in managing the risks to which it is exposed. 
The Board is satisfied with the effectiveness of the Group’s system 
of internal controls but, by their very nature, these procedures can 
provide reasonable, but not absolute, assurance against material 
misstatement or loss.
The Board has reviewed the need for an internal audit function. 
The Board has decided that, given the nature of the Company’s 
business and assets and the overall size of the Company, the 
systems and procedures currently employed provide sufficient 
assurance that a sound system of internal control, which 
safeguards shareholders’ investment and the Company’s assets, 
is in place. An internal audit function is therefore considered 
unnecessary. However, the Group does operate an audit and 
compliance team which carries out legal compliance checks 
and risk-based audits on all franchisees at least once a year.
Financial reporting
There is a comprehensive planning system, including regular 
periodic forecasts which are presented to and approved by the 
Board. The performance of the Group is reported monthly and 
compared to the latest forecast and the prior period.
Relations with shareholders
Keeping investors informed is an essential part of the Company’s 
corporate communications strategy and is achieved by means of 
an active investor relations programme. The aim is to ensure that 
the Company’s business model, strategic goals and future prospects 
are clearly understood by the investment community. The Company 
operates a high level of transparency with regards to its operations by 
providing consistent information across all channels of communication. 
The Board places a high emphasis on shareholder engagement 
and, through an open and transparent dialogue with shareholders, 
aims to ensure that shareholders’ objectives and views on the 
Company’s performance are understood. The Chairman makes 
himself available to major shareholders on request and periodically 
attends meetings with and gives presentations to shareholders.
The Group’s corporate website, www.belvoirlettingsplc.com, 
aims to provide investors with the required information to fully 
understand the business, including the annual and interim report, 
and to potentially make an investment decision. The website is 
regularly reviewed and updated to reflect new information.
All shareholders will receive at least 21 clear days’ notice of the 
Annual General Meeting, which is normally attended by all Directors. 
Shareholders are invited to ask questions during the meeting and to 
meet with Directors after the formal proceedings have ended.

Directors’ remuneration report
“ During the year our executive remuneration 
packages were revised to ensure that we retain 
and motivate our talented Executive Team over 
a longer period of time and that their reward 
is aligned to maximising shareholder return.”
The Directors present the Directors’ 
remuneration report for the year 
ended 31 December 2017.
The Remuneration Committee sets the overall policy on 
remuneration and other terms of employment of Directors. The 
Remuneration Committee aims to ensure that the remuneration 
packages offered are competitive and designed to attract, retain 
and motivate Directors of the right calibre. When assessing the 
pay and benefits of the Directors, the Remuneration Committee 
takes account of remuneration and benefits information in the 
marketplace and the pay and employment conditions elsewhere 
in the Group. In 2017 executive remuneration packages were 
reviewed by FIT Remuneration Consultants LLP, who advised the 
Remuneration Committee on a new remuneration plan comprising 
a fixed salary, a variable annual bonus based on achieving certain 
budgeted short-term targets and a long-term share option element 
linked to performance targets over the period to 31 December 2020. 
The provisions of the new plan reflect the increasing responsibilities 
of the Executive Team given the enlarged Group and incorporates 
longer-term objectives to ensure that the Executive Team is 
incentivised to maximise profitability and shareholder return.
Remuneration for Non-Executive Directors consists of fees for their 
services in connection with Board and Committee meetings. These 
fees are to be determined by the Committee without the involvement 
of the Non-Executive Director concerned. Non-Executive Directors 
do not participate in any Group pension or share option schemes.
All Directors are subject to retirement by rotation.
Basic salary or fees
Basic salary or fees for each Director are reviewed annually by the 
Remuneration Committee, taking into account the performance 
of the individual and information from independent sources on 
the rates of salary for similar posts.
Annual bonus
The Company operates a bonus scheme to incentivise Executive 
Directors to meet the financial and strategic objectives of the Group. 
During the financial year ended 31 December 2017, a total bonus 
of £178,000 (2016: £135,000) was awarded to the Directors.
Pension
During the year pension contributions of £34,000 (2016: £16,000) 
were paid to Executive Directors.
Taxable benefits
The Directors’ taxable benefits are tabled opposite.
Service contracts
The Executive Directors of the Company do not have a notice 
period in excess of twelve months under the terms of their service 
contracts. Their service contracts contain no provisions for 
predetermined compensation on termination which exceed one 
year’s salary and benefits in kind. Non-Executive Directors do not 
have service contracts with the Company but have letters of 
appointment which can be terminated on three months’ notice.

Company policy on external appointments
The Company recognises that its Directors are likely to be invited 
to become non-executive directors of other companies and that 
exposure to such non-executive duties can broaden their experience 
and knowledge, which will benefit the Group. Executive and 
Non-Executive Directors are therefore, subject to approval of the 
Company’s Board, allowed to accept non-executive appointments, 
as long as these are not with competing companies and are not 
likely to lead to conflicts of interest. Executive and Non-Executive 
Directors are allowed to retain the fees paid. Nicholas Leeming has 
extensive experience of the property market but was appointed 
to the Board mainly for his knowledge of internet-based business. 
Nicholas’ other appointments may also draw upon this knowledge 
but he does not act for any other businesses involved in property 
franchising and hence no conflict arises.
Audited information
Details of the Directors’ shareholding interests and remuneration 
for the financial year ended 31 December 2017, disclosed opposite,

Share options
The Remuneration Committee is responsible for awarding options over ordinary shares to Executive Directors and certain senior managers 
under the Company’s enterprise management incentive (EMI) share option scheme. The scheme is intended to offer long-term incentives 
to Directors and senior management. The Remuneration Committee believes that the potential for share ownership and participation in the 
growing value of the Company increases the commitment and loyalty of Directors and staff. Options outstanding as at 31 December 2017

* Nicholas Leeming stood down from the Board on 10 April 2018. 30 Belvoir Lettings plc Annual report and accounts 2017
Directors’ report
The Directors present their annual report 
and audited consolidated financial 
statements of the Group for the financial 
year ended 31 December 2017.
The Directors of the Company who were in office during the year 
and up to the date of signing the financial statements are detailed 
on page 25.
Dividends
The Company paid its interim dividend for the financial year ended 
31 December 2017 of 3.4p per ordinary share on 27 October 2017.
The Board recommends a final dividend for the financial year 
ended 31 December 2017 of 3.5p (2016: 3.4p) per share to be paid 
on 31 May 2018 to all shareholders on the register at the close of 
business on 20 April 2018 subject to shareholders’ approval on 
29 May 2018. The ex-dividend date will be on 19 April 2018.
Future developments
The Board continues to deliver growth through the support of the 
network to promote organic growth, the expansion of Belvoir 
territories and the financial support of franchisee-led acquisitions. 
Furthermore, the Board is pursuing strategic growth as a multi-brand 
franchising group through the acquisition of other franchised networks, 
building on the Group’s strength as a highly regarded franchisor 
within the residential property sales and lettings sector.
Capital and equity structure
Details of the ordinary shares of the Company are shown in note 19 
of these financial statements.
Directors’ indemnity
The Group maintains third party Directors’ and officers’ liability 
insurance which gives appropriate cover against any legal action 
that may be brought against them.
Employees
The Group believes in a policy of equal opportunities. Recruitment 
and promotion are undertaken on the basis of merit regardless of 
gender, race, age, marital status, sexual orientation, religion, nationality, 
colour or disability. If an employee becomes disabled during the 
course of their employment, adjustments are made where possible 
to enable such employee to carry on working despite their disability.
Going concern
The Group and the Company’s financial statements have been 
prepared on a going concern basis. The Directors note that as at 
31 December 2017 both the Group and the Company are in a net 
current liability position of £3,731,000 and £1,366,000 respectively. 
This reflects the contingent consideration estimated at £4,901,000 
payable to the vendors of Northwood GB Limited, which is to be 
settled in cash or equity as determined by the Company. In addition 
a new banking facility with HSBC was entered into in March 2018 
which will provide additional funding sufficient to cover the 
contingent consideration should the Directors decide on 
a cash settlement.
After consideration of forecasts for at least twelve months 
from the date of signing of the financial statements and making 
appropriate enquiries, the Directors have a reasonable expectation 
that the Group has adequate resources to continue in operational 
existence, and execute its plan for acquisition growth, for the 
foreseeable future.
There are no material uncertainties, of which the Directors are 
aware, that may cast doubt on the entity’s ability to continue 
as a going concern by reference to guidance by the Financial 
Reporting Council on going concern assessment.
Financial and risk management policies
Details of the Group’s financial and risk management policies 
are discussed in note 22 of these financial statements. 31 Annual report and accounts 2017 Belvoir Lettings plc
The Directors of the ultimate parent company are responsible for the 
maintenance and integrity of the of the ultimate parent company’s 
website. Legislation in the United Kingdom governing the preparation 
and dissemination of financial statements may differ from legislation 
in other jurisdictions.
The Directors consider that the annual report and accounts, taken 
as a whole, is fair, balanced and understandable and provides the 
information necessary for shareholders to assess the Group and 
parent company’s performance, business model and strategy.
Each of the Directors, whose names and functions are listed in the 
Governance section, confirm that, to the best of their knowledge:
 ∞ the parent company financial statements, which have been 
prepared in accordance with IFRS as adopted by the European 
Union, give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial 
position and profit of the Company;
 ∞ the Group financial statements, which have been prepared in 
accordance with IFRS as adopted by the European Union, give a 
true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and 
profit of the Group; and
 ∞ the Strategic report includes a fair review of the development 
and performance of the business and the position of the Group 
and parent company, together with a description of the 
principal risks and uncertainties that it faces. 
Independent auditor
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP has expressed its willingness to continue 
as auditor. In accordance with Section 489 of the Companies Act 2006 
a resolution to re-appoint PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP will be 
proposed at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting.
On behalf of the Board
Louise George
Chief Financial Officer
10 April 2018
“ Having developed a multi-brand franchise 
model, the Board is looking to build further 
growth through the introduction of additional 
property-related services as evidenced by 
the acquisition of Brook Financial Services.”
Statement of Directors’ responsibilities
The Directors are responsible for preparing the annual report 
and the financial statements in accordance with applicable law 
and regulations.
Company law requires the Directors to prepare financial 
statements for each financial year. Under that law the Directors 
have prepared the Group financial statements in accordance with 
International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted by 
the European Union and the parent company financial statements 
in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards 
(IFRS) as adopted by the European Union. Under company law the 
Directors must not approve the financial statements unless they 
are satisfied that they give a true and fair view of the state of affairs 
of the Group and parent company and of the profit or loss of the 
Group and parent company for that period. In preparing the 
financial statements, the Directors are required to:
 ∞ select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;
 ∞ state whether applicable IFRS as adopted by the European Union 
have been followed for the Group financial statements and IFRS 
as adopted by the European Union have been followed for 
the parent company financial statements, subject to any material 
departures disclosed and explained in the financial statements;
 ∞ make judgements and accounting estimates that are reasonable 
and prudent; and
 ∞ prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis 
unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Group and parent 
company will continue in business.
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting 
records that are sufficient to show and explain the Group and parent 
company’s transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at 
any time the financial position of the Group and parent company 
and enable them to ensure that the financial statements comply 
with the Companies Act 2006 and, as regards the Group financial 
statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation.
The Directors are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of 
the Group and parent company and hence for taking reasonable 
steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities. 32 Belvoir Lettings plc Annual report and accounts 2017
Report on the audit of the financial statements
Opinion
In our opinion, Belvoir Lettings PLC’s group financial statements and parent company financial statements (the “financial statements”):
 ∞ give a true and fair view of the state of the group’s and of the parent company’s affairs as at 31 December 2017 and of the group’s 
profit and the group’s and the parent company’s cash flows for the year then ended;
 ∞ have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRS as adopted by the European Union and, as regards the parent company’s 
financial statements, as applied in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006; and
 ∞ have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006.
We have audited the financial statements, included within the annual report and accounts 2017 (the “Annual Report”), which comprise: 
the group and parent company statements of financial position as at 31 December 2017; the group statement of comprehensive income, 
the group and parent company statements of cash flows, and the group and parent company statements of changes in equity for the 
year then ended; and the notes to the financial statements, which include a description of the significant accounting policies.
Basis for opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK) (“ISAs (UK)”) and applicable law. Our responsibilities 
under ISAs (UK) are further described in the Auditors’ responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements section of our report. 
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.
Independence
We remained independent of the group in accordance with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the financial 
statements in the UK, which includes the FRC’s Ethical Standard, as applicable to listed entities, and we have fulfilled our other ethical 
responsibilities in accordance with these requirements.
Our audit approach
Overview
 
 ∞ Overall group materiality: £218,500 (2016: £150,000), based on 5% of profit before tax, 
adjusted for non-recurring exceptional items.
 ∞ Overall parent company materiality: £207,500 (2016: £135,000), based on 1% of net assets.
 
 ∞ The Group comprises a consolidation of eleven legal entities.
 ∞ We conducted an audit of the complete financial information of nine legal entities, together 
with additional procedures performed, including over the Group consolidation.
 ∞ The components on which audits of the complete financial information and centralised work 
was performed accounted for 100% of Group revenue.
 
 ∞ Acquisition accounting (Group and parent).
 ∞ Recoverability of franchisee debtors (Group).
 ∞ Impairments of intangibles and goodwill (Group).
 ∞ Exceptional, non-recurring items (Group and parent).
The scope of our audit
As part of designing our audit, we determined materiality and assessed the risks of material misstatement in the financial statements. 
In particular, we looked at where the Directors made subjective judgements, for example in respect of significant accounting estimates 
that involved making assumptions and considering future events that are inherently uncertain. 
As in all of our audits we also addressed the risk of management override of internal controls, including evaluating whether there was 
evidence of bias by the Directors that represented a risk of material misstatement due to fraud.

Key audit matters
Key audit matters are those matters that, in the auditors’ professional judgement, were of most significance in the audit of the financial 
statements of the current period and include the most significant assessed risks of material misstatement (whether or not due to fraud) 
identified by the auditors, including those which had the greatest effect on: the overall audit strategy; the allocation of resources in the 
audit; and directing the efforts of the engagement team. These matters, and any comments we make on the results of our procedures 
thereon, were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and 
we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. This is not a complete list of all risks identified by our audit. 
Key audit matter How our audit addressed the key audit matter
Acquisition accounting – Group and Parent
Refer to the significant judgements and key sources 
of estimation uncertainty in note 1 to the accounts.
Belvoir Lettings plc acquired the share capital of Brook Financial 
Services Limited in July 2017. Provisional fair values were attributed 
to each of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed.
In addition, contingent consideration is due in May 2018 in 
relation to the prior year acquisition of Northwood GB Limited.
We have assessed the fair values ascribed to the assets and liabilities 
that were purchased as part of the acquisition of Brook Financial 
Services Limited. 
In particular, we challenged management’s assessment that there 
were no acquired intangible assets and found this to be reasonable.
We have reviewed the analysis which supports the contingent 
consideration due in relation to the Northwood GB Limited 
acquisition. For those months which remain a forecast we have 
challenged management’s assumptions in arriving at these results 
and consider these to be reasonable.
Recoverability of franchisee debtors – Group
Refer to the significant judgements and key sources 
of estimation uncertainty in note 1 to the accounts.
Loans to franchisees represent a material balance within 
the statement of financial position. The Group assesses the 
recoverability of these balances and provisions are booked 
where recoverability of a specific balance is in doubt. 
We have assessed the franchisee debtor balance at the year end 
analysed between current and overdue amounts. Testing has been 
performed post-year end to understand which of these amounts 
have been subsequently paid.
We have assessed franchisees who have had their contract 
terms amended to allow for “payment holidays” to understand the 
circumstances around these revisions.
We have performed an analysis of MSF income against outstanding 
loan balances to identify franchisees with a comparably high loan 
amount compared to income. We have challenged management 
to understand the factors resulting in such circumstances and the 
recoverability of these amounts.
We are satisfied with management’s assessment of the recoverability 
of the franchisee balance at the year end.
Impairments of intangibles and goodwill – Group
Refer to the significant judgements and key sources 
of estimation uncertainty in note 1 to the accounts.
A significant balance of goodwill and intangible assets exists 
on consolidation in relation to the Newton Fallowell Group, 
Goodchilds Estate Agents & Lettings Limited, Northwood GB 
Limited and Brook Financial Services Limited and a number 
of smaller corporate offices.
These assets require assessment at the year-end date to determine 
if impairment is necessary. 
We have reviewed the impairment assessment models prepared by 
management which include a number of key assumptions including 
the discount rate and growth rate.
We have provided independent challenge to these assumptions, 
including undertaking a sensitivity analysis.
We have identified no indication of impairment as a result of the 
models produced by management. We are satisfied that the 
assumptions are reasonable.
Exceptional non-recurring items – Group and Parent
Refer to the significant judgements and key sources 
of estimation uncertainty in note 1 to the accounts.
Costs relating to the acquisition of Brook Financial Services 
Limited, the aborted merger with The Property Franchise Group 
and the restructuring of the Group have been separately 
disclosed as exceptional items.
We have tested the items that are disclosed as exceptional in 
the income statement and concluded that they are in accordance 
with the Group’s accounting policy for such items and are 
appropriately disclosed.
How we tailored the audit scope
We tailored the scope of our audit to ensure that we performed enough work to be able to give an opinion on the financial statements 
as a whole, taking into account the structure of the group and the parent company, the accounting processes and controls, and the 
industry in which they operate.
The Group is structured with one segment. The Group financial statements are a consolidation of eleven legal entities within this 
segment, comprising the Group’s operating business and centralised functions. 34 Belvoir Lettings plc Annual report and accounts 2017
Report on the audit of the financial statements continued
Our audit approach continued
How we tailored the audit scope continued
In establishing the overall approach to the Group audit, we identified three legal entities: Belvoir Property Management (UK) Limited, 
Northwood GB Limited and Newton Fallowell Limited, which, in our view, required an audit of their complete financial information due 
to their financial significance to the Group.
In addition, we also conducted the statutory audits of the remaining six non-significant legal entities such that the audit work was complete 
prior to finalisation of the audit of the Group financial statements, thereby providing further evidence in support of our Group opinion. 
The audits of these nine legal entities, together with the additional procedures performed at the Group level, including over the Group 
consolidation, gave us the evidence we needed for our opinion on the Group financial statements as a whole.
Materiality
The scope of our audit was influenced by our application of materiality. We set certain quantitative thresholds for materiality. These, 
together with qualitative considerations, helped us to determine the scope of our audit and the nature, timing and extent of our audit 
procedures on the individual financial statement line items and disclosures and in evaluating the effect of misstatements, both 
individually and in aggregate on the financial statements as a whole. 
Based on our professional judgement, we determined materiality for the financial statements as a whole as follows:
 Group financial statements Parent company financial statements
Overall materiality £218,500 (2016: £150,000). £207,500 (2016: £135,000).
How we determined it 5% of profit before tax, adjusted for 
non-recurring exceptional items.
1% of net assets.
Rationale for 
benchmark applied
Based on the benchmarks used in the 
annual report, profit before tax, adjusted for 
non-recurring exceptional items is the primary 
measure used by the shareholders in assessing 
the performance of the group, and is a generally 
accepted auditing benchmark. Exceptional 
items have been adjusted for to allow greater 
comparability in the underlying performance.
We believe that net assets is the primary measure used 
by the shareholders in assessing the performance of 
the entity, given it is non trading, and is a generally 
accepted auditing benchmark.
For each component in the scope of our group audit, we allocated a materiality that is less than our overall group materiality. The range 
of materiality allocated across components was between £2,500 and £207,500. Certain components were audited to a local statutory 
audit materiality that was also less than our overall group materiality.
We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to them misstatements identified during our audit above £10,925 (Group audit) 
(2016: £7,500) and £10,375 (Parent company audit) (2016: £6,750) as well as misstatements below those amounts that, in our view, warranted 
reporting for qualitative reasons.
Conclusions relating to going concern
We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters in relation to which ISAs (UK) require us to report to you when: 
 ∞ the Directors’ use of the going concern basis of accounting in the preparation of the financial statements is not appropriate; or 
 ∞ the Directors have not disclosed in the financial statements any identified material uncertainties that may cast significant doubt about 
the group’s and parent company’s ability to continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting for a period of at least twelve 
months from the date when the financial statements are authorised for issue.
However, because not all future events or conditions can be predicted, this statement is not a guarantee as to the group’s and parent 
company’s ability to continue as a going concern.
Reporting on other information 
The other information comprises all of the information in the Annual Report other than the financial statements and our auditors’ 
report thereon. The Directors are responsible for the other information. Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the 
other information and, accordingly, we do not express an audit opinion or, except to the extent otherwise explicitly stated in this report, 
any form of assurance thereon. 
In connection with our audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider 
whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit, or otherwise 
appears to be materially misstated. If we identify an apparent material inconsistency or material misstatement, we are required to perform 
procedures to conclude whether there is a material misstatement of the financial statements or a material misstatement of the other 
information. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, 
we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report based on these responsibilities.
With respect to the Strategic Report and Directors’ Report, we also considered whether the disclosures required by the UK Companies 
Act 2006 have been included.

Report on the audit of the financial statements continued
Reporting on other information continued
Based on the responsibilities described above and our work undertaken in the course of the audit, ISAs (UK) require us also to report 
certain opinions and matters as described below.
Strategic Report and Directors’ Report
In our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of the audit, the information given in the Strategic Report and Directors’ 
Report for the year ended 31 December 2017 is consistent with the financial statements and has been prepared in accordance with 
applicable legal requirements. 
In light of the knowledge and understanding of the group and parent company and their environment obtained in the course of the 
audit, we did not identify any material misstatements in the Strategic Report and Directors’ Report. 
Responsibilities for the financial statements and the audit
Responsibilities of the Directors for the financial statements
As explained more fully in the Statement of Directors’ responsibilities, the Directors are responsible for the preparation of the financial 
statements in accordance with the applicable framework and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view. The Directors are 
also responsible for such internal control as they determine is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are 
free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
In preparing the financial statements, the Directors are responsible for assessing the group’s and the parent company’s ability to 
continue as a going concern, disclosing as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting 
unless the Directors either intend to liquidate the group or the parent company or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative 
but to do so.
Auditors’ responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material 
misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditors’ report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high 
level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs (UK) will always detect a material misstatement 
when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could 
reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements. 
A further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements is located on the FRC’s website at: www.frc.org.uk/
auditorsresponsibilities. This description forms part of our auditors’ report.
Use of this report
This report, including the opinions, has been prepared for and only for the parent company’s members as a body in accordance 
with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006 and for no other purpose. We do not, in giving these opinions, accept or assume 
responsibility for any other purpose or to any other person to whom this report is shown or into whose hands it may come save where 
expressly agreed by our prior consent in writing.
Other required reporting
Companies Act 2006 exception reporting
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if, in our opinion:
 ∞ we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit; or
 ∞ adequate accounting records have not been kept by the parent company, or returns adequate for our audit have not been received 
from branches not visited by us; or
 ∞ certain disclosures of Directors’ remuneration specified by law are not made; or
 ∞ the parent company financial statements are not in agreement with the accounting records and returns. 
We have no exceptions to report arising from this responsibility.

Notes to the financial statements
For the financial year ended 31 December 2017
1 Accounting policies
General information
Belvoir Lettings plc is the ultimate parent company of the Group, whose principal activity during the year under review was that 
of selling, supporting and training residential property franchises.
Belvoir Lettings plc, a public limited company listed on AIM, is incorporated and domiciled in the United Kingdom.
Registered office
The address of the registered office and principal place of business of Belvoir Lettings plc is The Old Courthouse, 60A London Road, 
Grantham, Lincolnshire NG31 6HR.
Basis of preparation
The Group and Company financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention with the exception of 
the freehold property which has been revalued. Being listed on AIM, the Company is required to present its consolidated financial 
statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and IFRS Interpretations Committee (IFRS IC) 
interpretations as adopted by the European Union and with the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS. 
Going concern
The Directors note that as at 31 December 2017 both the Group and the Company are in a net current liability position of £3,731,000 
and £1,366,000 respectively, which reflects contingent consideration estimated at £4,901,000 to be settled in either cash or equity as 
determined by the Company. In addition the Group has put in place a new banking facility with HSBC which will provide additional 
funding sufficient to cover the contingent consideration should the Directors decide on a cash settlement.
After consideration of forecasts and making appropriate enquiries, the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group and 
the Company have adequate resources to continue in operational existence, and execute their plan for acquisition growth, for the 
foreseeable future. For this reason, they continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the accounts. There are no material 
uncertainties, of which Directors are aware, that may cast doubt on the Group and Company’s ability to continue as a going concern 
by reference to the guidance issued by the Financial Reporting Council on going concern assessment.
Standards adopted for the first time
A number of new and revised standards are effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2017. Adoption of these 
standards has not had an impact on the Group’s financial statements.
Standards, amendments and interpretations to existing standards that are not yet effective
A number of new standards and amendments to the standards and interpretations are effective for annual periods beginning after 
1 January 2018, and have not been applied in preparing these statements. None of these is expected to have a significant effect on the 
financial statements of the Group or Company, except the following, set out below: 
 ∞ IFRS 9 Financial Instruments is effective for periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018, and impacts the rules relating to 
the classification, measurement and impairment of financial assets. The Group has performed an impact assessment and does not 
anticipate a material change to the net assets of the Group upon transition to the new standard. The Group holds all financial assets 
with the intention of collecting the contractual cash flows, and no indicators have been noted through the assessment performed 
that contractual terms would fail the solely payments of principal and interest test. Additionally, no material changes are anticipated 
through moving from the current “incurred credit loss” model under IAS 39 to the “expected credit loss model”. The Group does not 
apply hedge accounting under IAS 39, so is not impacted by the changes required by IFRS 9.
 ∞ IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers, which deals with revenue recognition and establishes principles for reporting useful 
information to users of financial statements about the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from 
an entity’s contracts with customers. Revenue is recognised when a customer obtains control of a good or service and thus has the ability 
to direct the use and obtain the benefits from the good or service. The standard replaces IAS 18, Revenue and related interpretations and is 
effective for periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018. The Group has carried out a review of existing contractual arrangements 
as part of this process to identify the customer contracts, the performance obligations, the transaction price and when the performance 
obligation is satisfied. The Directors anticipate there will be no material impact on the Group’s revenue streams as set out in note 2.
 ∞ IFRS 16 Leases, which addresses the definition of a lease, recognition and measurement of leases, and establishes principles for 
reporting useful information to users of financial statements about the leasing activities of both lessees and lessors. The standard is 
effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2019. A key change arising from IFRS 16 is that most operating leases will 
be accounted for on balance sheet for lessees. The standard replaces IAS 17, Leases and related interpretations. The Group holds 
a number of property, vehicle and equipment leases which will be recognised as additional tangible fixed assets together with an 
additional lease liability. From 1 January 2019, the operating lease charge would be replaced by a depreciation and an interest charge, 
and this is not expected to be materially different. The Directors are in the process of reviewing contracts to identify any additional 
lease arrangements that would need to be recognised under IFRS 16.
There are no other new standards, amendments to existing standards or interpretations that are not yet effective that would be 
expected to have a material impact on the Group. 41 Annual report and accounts 2017 Belvoir Lettings plc
1 Accounting policies continued
Basis of consolidation
The Group financial statements include those of the parent company and its subsidiaries, drawn up to 31 December 2017. Subsidiaries 
are entities over which the Group obtains and exercises control through voting rights. Income, expenditure, unrealised gains and 
intra-group balances arising from transactions within the Group are eliminated. Unrealised losses are also eliminated unless the 
transaction provides evidence of an impairment of the asset transferred.
The acquisition of its principal subsidiaries by the Group in prior years was a common control business combination, which falls outside 
the scope of IFRS 3, and the Group therefore developed an accounting policy based on the pooling of interests method. Under this method, 
the financial statements of the parties to the combination are aggregated and presented as though the combining entities had always 
been part of the same group. 
At the time of the IPO, as a result of the pooling of interests method, a number of accounting adjustments arose. The parent company 
statement of financial position shows a merger reserve of £8,101,000 and an investment of £12,450,000. On a Group basis, the investment 
by Belvoir Lettings plc in Belvoir Property Management (UK) Limited was restated at the nominal value of shares issued and cash paid 
rather than at fair value. This results in a merger reserve with a debit balance of £5,774,000 in the Group statement of financial position.
Subsequent acquisitions of subsidiaries are dealt with by the acquisition method. The acquisition method involves recognition at fair 
value of all identifiable assets and liabilities, including contingent liabilities of the subsidiary at the acquisition date, regardless of whether 
or not they were recorded in the financial statements of the subsidiary prior to acquisition. 
Acquisitions which include an element of deferred consideration which is contingent on events after the acquisition date are recognised 
at the date of acquisition based on all information available at that date. Any subsequent changes to these amounts are recognised 
through the income statement.
Goodwill is stated after separating out identifiable intangible assets. Goodwill represents the excess of fair value of consideration transferred 
over the fair value of the Group’s share of the identifiable net assets of the acquired subsidiary at the date of acquisition. Acquisition-related 
transaction costs are recorded as an exceptional administrative expense in the Group statement of comprehensive income.
Goodwill is capitalised and reviewed annually for impairment. Goodwill is carried at cost less accumulated impairment losses. Negative 
goodwill (where the fair value of the assets acquired exceeds the purchase price) is recognised immediately after the acquisition in the 
Group statement of comprehensive income.
Revenue recognition
Revenue represents income from management service fees (MSF), fees from the sale of franchise licences (initial franchise fees), 
commission on resales of franchised offices, fees generated from corporate-owned offices and commission received on financial services.
MSF are invoiced to individual franchisees on a monthly basis in relation to a percentage of their turnover for any given month. They are 
recognised in the month in which the income is receivable.
Initial franchise fees are recognised upon signing of the contract as it is at this point that the new franchisee has a legal obligation to make 
good the terms of the contract. The initial fees are for the use of the brand along with initial training and support and promotion during 
the opening phase of the new office. As such the Group regards this as a separate initial transaction for which it has fulfilled its obligations.
Corporate-owned offices are those that are operated directly by the Group and not by franchises. These corporate offices invoice landlords 
on a monthly basis and so recognise the income during the period in which the work is carried out. Corporate revenue also arises from 
fees on property sales which are recognised by reference to the legal exchange date of the housing transaction as all obligations have 
been fulfilled at that point.
Commission from financial services is recognised on amounts received on a weekly basis from the Mortgage Advice Bureau on 
policies written by Brook Financial Services Limited and Newton & Derry Financial Services Limited, net of the provision for potential 
clawback of premiums on cancellation of life policies.
Cost of sales
Cost of sales has been introduced following the acquisition of Brook Financial Services Limited. The costs are attributable to cost 
of sales as they represent amounts paid to advisors and introducer commission paid to companies, in relation to financial services.
Exceptional items
Exceptional items are disclosed separately in the financial statements where it is necessary to do so to provide further understanding of 
the financial performance of the Group. They are items that are material either because of their size or their nature, or that are non-recurring 
and are presented within the line items to which they best relate. 42 Belvoir Lettings plc Annual report and accounts 2017

Dividend
Dividend income is recognised when the right to receive payment is established.
Final dividends to the Company’s shareholders are recognised as a liability in the Group’s financial statements in the period in which 
the dividends are approved by the Company’s shareholders. Interim dividends are recognised when paid.
Intangible assets
In accordance with IFRS 3 Business Combinations, an intangible asset acquired in a business combination is deemed to have a cost to 
the Group of its fair value at the acquisition date. The fair value of the intangible asset reflects market expectations about the probability 
that the future economic benefits embodied in the asset will flow to the Group. 
Amortisation charges are included in administrative expenses in the statement of comprehensive income. Amortisation is charged 
on intangibles with a finite life. Amortisation begins when the intangible asset is first available for use and is provided at rates calculated 
to write off the cost of each intangible asset over its expected useful life, as follows:
Trade names/brands  – between 10 and 20 years
Customer relationships   – between 10 and 25 years
Master franchise agreements – 25 years
Acquired trade names are identified as separate intangible assets where they can be reliably measured by valuation of future cash flows. 
The trade names which have been identified separately are assessed as having a life reflecting their respective trading histories.
Acquired customer relationships are identified as a separate intangible asset as they are separable and can be reliably measured by 
valuation of future cash flows. This valuation also assesses the life of the particular relationship, which is reassessed annually. Customer 
relationship assets are being written off over a remaining life of ten to 25 years.
Acquired franchise master agreements are identified as a separate intangible asset as they are separable and can be reliably measured 
by valuation of future cash flows. The life of the relationship is assessed annually. Master franchise agreements are being written off 
over a remaining life of 25 years as historical analyses show that, on average, 4% of franchises will change ownership per annum.
Subsequent to initial recognition, intangible assets are stated at deemed cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment charges.
Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation and any provision for impairment.
Depreciation is calculated so as to write off the cost or revaluation of an asset, less its estimated residual value, over the useful 
economic life of that asset, as follows:
Freehold land   – not depreciated
Freehold property   – 2% straight line on cost
Fixtures and fittings  – 20% to 33% straight line on cost
Material residual value estimates and expected useful lives are updated as required but at least annually.
The revaluation reserve reflects a revaluation of the freehold property to market value.
Impairment testing of goodwill, other intangible assets, and property, plant and equipment
For the purposes of assessing impairment, assets are grouped at the lowest levels for which there are largely independent cash flows 
(cash generating units). As a result, some assets are tested individually for impairment and some are tested at cash generating unit level.
Goodwill is allocated to those cash generating units that are expected to benefit from synergies of the related business combination 
and represent the lowest level within the Group at which the management monitors goodwill. 
Cash generating units to which goodwill has been allocated are tested for impairment at least annually. All other individual assets or 
cash generating units are tested whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.
An impairment loss is recognised for the amount by which the asset’s or cash generating unit’s carrying amount exceeds its recoverable 
amount. The recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell, reflecting market conditions, and the value in use based 
on estimated future cash flows from each cash generating unit, discounted at a suitable rate in order to calculate the present value of 
those cash flows. The data used for impairment testing procedures is directly linked to the Group’s latest approved budgets, adjusted 
as necessary to exclude any future restructuring to which the Group is not yet committed.
Impairment losses for cash generating units reduce first the carrying value of any goodwill allocated to that cash generating unit. Any 
remaining impairment loss is charged pro rata to the other assets in the cash generating unit. With the exception of goodwill, all assets 
are subsequently reassessed for indications that an impairment loss previously recognised may no longer exist. Impairment charges are 
included in operating costs in the statement of comprehensive income. 43 Annual report and accounts 2017 Belvoir Lettings plc
1 Accounting policies continued
Investments
Investments in subsidiaries are stated at cost less provision for impairment.
Taxation
Current tax is the tax currently payable based on the taxable profit for the year.
Deferred income taxes are calculated using the liability method on temporary differences, at the tax rate that is substantively enacted 
at the balance sheet date. Deferred tax is generally provided on the difference between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities 
and their tax bases. However, deferred tax is not provided on the initial recognition of goodwill, nor on the initial recognition of an asset 
or liability unless the related transaction is a business combination or affects tax or accounting profit. Tax losses available to be carried 
forward as well as other income tax credits to the Group are assessed for recognition as deferred tax assets.
Deferred tax liabilities are provided in full, with no discounting. Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that 
the underlying deductible temporary differences will be able to offset against future taxable income. Current and deferred tax assets 
and liabilities are calculated at tax rates that are expected to apply to their respective period of realisation, provided they are enacted 
or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date. Changes in deferred tax assets or liabilities are recognised as a component of tax 
expense in the statement of comprehensive income, except where they relate to items that are charged or credited directly to equity, 
in which case the related deferred tax is also charged or credited directly to equity. 
On 1 May 2017 the Group acquired Belvoir Yardley, a franchised outlet. No tax relief is available on either the goodwill or customer lists 
acquired. Whilst the initial book value of goodwill is higher than the tax base, no deferred liability is accounted for and any subsequent 
impairments should be treated as permanent differences for tax and have no impact on deferred tax. The value of the acquired customer 
lists is amortised over 15 years. An initial deferred tax liability is recognised and reduced subsequently in line with amortisation creating 
a deferred tax credit.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents are defined as cash balances in hand and in the bank including short-term, highly liquid investments that 
are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and which are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value.
Operating lease commitments
Rentals applicable to operating leases where substantially all of the benefits and risks of ownership remain with the lessor are charged 
to the statement of comprehensive income on a straight-line basis over the period of the lease.
Client money
The Group holds client monies on behalf of landlords in separate bank accounts that do not form part of the financial statements.
Financial assets
The Group has financial assets classified as loans and receivables. The Group’s loans and receivables as stated in the statement 
of financial position comprise trade and other receivables and cash and cash equivalents. 
Cash and cash equivalents include cash in hand and deposits held at call with banks.
Loans and receivables
These assets are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market. They arise 
principally through the provision of services to franchisees (e.g. trade receivables) and from loans to franchisees to part-fund the acquisition 
of a property-related agency, but also incorporate other types of contractual monetary asset. They are initially recognised at fair value 
plus transaction costs that are directly attributable to their acquisition or issue, and are subsequently carried at amortised cost using the 
effective interest rate method, less provision for impairment.
Impairment provisions are recognised when there is objective evidence (such as significant financial difficulties on the part of the 
counterparty or default or significant delay in payment) that the Group will be unable to collect all of the amounts due under the terms 
receivable, the amount of such a provision being the difference between the net carrying amount and the present value of the future 
expected cash flows associated with the impaired receivable. For trade receivables, which are reported net, such provisions are recorded 
in a separate allowance account with the loss being recognised within operating expenses in the statement of comprehensive income. 
On confirmation that the trade receivable will not be collectable, the gross carrying value of the asset is written off against the associated 
provision. From time to time, the Group elects to renegotiate the terms of trade receivables due from franchisees. Such renegotiations 
will lead to changes in the timing of payments rather than changes to the amounts owed and, in consequence, where material the new 
expected cash flows are discounted at the original effective interest rate.
Financial liabilities
Financial liabilities comprise trade payables, borrowings and other short-term monetary liabilities, which are initially recognised at fair 
value net of transaction costs and subsequently carried at amortised cost using the effective interest method. 44 Belvoir Lettings plc Annual report and accounts 2017

Share-based employee remuneration
The Group operates an enterprise management incentive (EMI) scheme and issues equity-settled share-based payments to certain 
Executive Directors and employees. During the year the Group also introduced the Belvoir Lettings Performance Share Plan 2017 
to incentivise, retain and reward key Executive Directors.
Equity-settled share-based payments are measured at fair value at the date of grant. The fair value so determined is expensed on 
a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on the Group’s estimate of shares that will eventually vest. The level of vesting 
is reviewed annually, and the charge is adjusted to reflect actual and estimated levels of vesting.
The fair value of services received in return for share options granted is measured by reference to the fair value of share options. 
The estimate of the fair value of the services received is measured based on the Black Scholes option pricing model. This model takes 
into account the following variables: exercise price, share price at date of grant, expected term, expected share price volatility, risk-free 
interest rate and expected dividend yield. Expected volatility is estimated by considering historical average share price volatility.
In addition to the EMI scheme there is an unapproved share option scheme which allows Dorian Gonsalves to take up 163,399 shares 
at the float price of 75p.
Belvoir Lettings plc has the obligation to settle the share-based payment transaction and as such recognises the award to employees of 
Belvoir Property Management (UK) Limited as an equity-settled transaction. Belvoir Lettings plc does not have a direct investment in Belvoir 
Property Management (UK) Limited. However, to reflect the substance of the transaction, Belvoir Lettings plc has recognised an investment 
in Belvoir Property Management (UK) Limited with a corresponding equity reserve. This investment is tested for impairment annually.
Equity
Equity comprises the following:
 ∞ share capital represents the nominal value of equity share;
 ∞ share premium represents the excess over nominal value of the fair value of consideration received for shares, net of expenses of the share issue;
 ∞ share-based payments reserve represents the reserve arising from the fair value of the share options charge;
 ∞ revaluation reserve represents the accumulated net surplus on revaluation of freehold property;
 ∞ merger reserve represents the reserve arising in the Group and Company accounts following the application of merger accounting 
in the treatment of the reorganisation and flotation of the Group and Company; and
 ∞ retained earnings represents retained profits and losses.
Significant judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty
The Group makes certain estimates and assumptions regarding the future. Estimates and judgements are continually evaluated based on 
historical experience and other factors, including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.
In the future, actual experience may differ from these estimates and assumptions. The estimates and assumptions that have a significant 
risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year are discussed below.
Initial recognition, useful lives and carrying value of intangible assets
The fair value of customer relationships is recognised on each individual acquisition and requires the exercise of management judgement 
in each case. Customer relationships are amortised over their useful lives. Useful lives are based on management’s estimates of the period 
that the assets will generate revenue and are periodically reviewed for continued appropriateness. Potential impairment of carrying values 
or changes to estimates can result in significant variations in the carrying value and amounts charged to the statement of comprehensive 
income in specific periods. Further details of amortisation policies are given on page 42 and the movement on intangible assets is 
presented in note 10.
Acquisition accounting
On acquisition the assets and liabilities acquired are assessed to determine the fair value to be recognised on consolidation into the 
Group. Any contingent consideration subject to certain performance criteria is determined by reference to recent and forecast 
performance. In both cases, the exercise of management judgement is required.
Recoverability of franchise debtors
The recoverability of loans to franchisees is assessed by management and where in doubt a specific provision is booked.
Exceptional non-recurring items
Certain items are judged by management to be of an exceptional non-recurring nature and as such are reported separately 
as exceptional items. 45 Annual report and accounts 2017 Belvoir Lettings plc
2 Segmental information
The Executive Committee of the Board, as the chief operating decision maker, reviews financial information for and makes decisions 
about the Group’s overall franchising business. In the year ended 31 December 2017 the Board identified a single operating segment, 
that of franchisor of property agents and related financial services.
The segmental information is, therefore, the same as that set out in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income. The 
Directors consider operating profit as the key performance measure. The reported segment is consistent with the Group’s internal 
reporting for performance measurement and resources allocation.
Management does not report on a geographical basis and no customer represents greater than 10% of total revenue in either of the periods 
reported. The Directors believe there to be four material income streams, which are management service fees, revenue from corporate-owned 
offices, fees on the sale or resale of franchise territory fees and commission receivable on financial services and are split as follows:

9 Earnings per share
Group
Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the profit for the financial year by the weighted average number of ordinary shares 
in issue during the year. Options over ordinary shares and rights of conversion are described in note 26. The calculation of diluted 
earnings per share is derived from the basic earnings per share, adjusted to allow for the issue of shares under these instruments. 
Adjusted earnings per share and diluted adjusted earnings per share are calculated in the same way but having adjusted the profit for 
the year for exceptional items, amortisation of acquired intangibles and the share-based payment charge. The 2016 adjusted earnings 
per share figures have been restated to account for the amortisation of acquired intangibles and the share-based payment charge.

The corporate-owned offices Burton Lettings Limited and Belvoir Devizes were sold on 3 March 2017 and 31 March 2017 respectively. 
Belvoir Yardley came under corporate ownership between 3 May 2017 and 1 November 2017, when it was resold to a new franchise owner. 
After the utilisation of the impairment provision brought forward of £219,000 the net effect of these transactions was a profit of £6,000.
Goodwill is deemed to have an indefinite useful life. It is currently carried at cost and tested annually for impairment by reference to 
the value of the relevant cash generating units (CGUs) to their recoverable amount. The Group has defined its CGUs as Northwood, 
Newton Fallowell Group (including Goodchilds) and Brook Financial Services. Where the recoverable amount is less than the carrying 
value, an impairment results. During the year, goodwill was tested for impairment, with no impairment charge arising.

The recoverable amount of all CGUs has been determined based on a value-in-use calculations. These calculations use pre-tax cash 
flow projections over a period of five years assuming an annual growth rate of 2% followed by a terminal growth rate of 2% (2016: 2%), 
discounted at a pre-tax discount rate of 10% (2016: 10%) equivalent to the Group’s weighted average cost of capital. Assumptions on 
sales growth are within those applied in the approved budgets for the upcoming year and strategic projections representing the best 
estimate of future performance.
The Directors do not consider goodwill to be impaired. The Directors believe that no reasonably possible change in assumptions will 
cause the value in use to fall below the carrying value and hence impair the goodwill.

Capital management policy
The Group manages its capital to ensure its operations are adequately provided for as described below. The principal risks faced by the 
Group are detailed overleaf. The Group’s objective when managing capital is to safeguard its ability to continue as a going concern and 
so provide increasing shareholder value. The Group is meeting this objective through a combination of underlying organic growth and 
targeted growth by acquisition, which will generate regular and increasing returns to shareholders.
The capital structure of the Group consists of cash and cash equivalents and equity attributable to the shareholder comprising issued 
capital, reserves and retained earnings as disclosed in the statement of changes in equity.
Financial instruments – risk management
The Group is exposed through its operations to the following financial risks:
 ∞ interest rate risk;
 ∞ credit risk; and
 ∞ liquidity risk.
In common with all other businesses, the Group is exposed to risks that arise from its use of financial instruments. This note describes 
the Group’s objectives, policies and processes for managing those risks and the methods used to measure them. Further quantitative 
information in respect of these risks is presented throughout these financial statements. There have been no substantive changes in the 
Group’s exposure to financial instrument risks, its objectives, policies and processes for managing those risks or the methods used to 
measure them from previous periods unless otherwise stated in this note. 55 Annual report and accounts 2017 Belvoir Lettings plc

All of the financial assets and liabilities above are carried in the statement of financial position at amortised cost. The above amounts 
reflect the contractual undiscounted cash flows, including future interest charges, which may differ from carrying values of the 
liabilities at the reporting date.
General objectives, policies and processes
The Board has overall responsibility for the determination of the Group’s risk management objectives and policies and, whilst retaining 
ultimate responsibility for them, it has delegated the authority for designing and operating processes that ensure the effective implementation 
of the objectives and policies to the Group’s finance function. The Board receives monthly reports through which it reviews the effectiveness 
of the processes put in place and the appropriateness of the objectives and policies it sets.
The overall objective of the Board is to set policies that seek to reduce risk as far as possible without unduly affecting the Group’s 
competitiveness and flexibility. Further details regarding these policies are set out below.
Interest rate risk
Interest rate risk arises from the Group’s management of interest-bearing assets and liabilities.
The Group does not use hedging products to manage interest rate risk but uses treasury products for deposits until such time 
as required for acquisitions as part of the Group’s acquisition strategy. 56 Belvoir Lettings plc Annual report and accounts 2017
Notes to the financial statements continued

22 Financial instruments continued
Credit risk
Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a franchisee or a counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its contractual 
obligations. It is Group policy to assess the credit risk of new franchisees before entering contracts.
The highest risk exposure is in relation to loans to franchises and their ability to service their debt. The Directors have established a credit 
policy under which each new franchisee is analysed individually for creditworthiness before a franchise is offered. The Company’s review 
includes external ratings, when available, and in some cases bank references. The Group does not consider that it has significant 
concentration of credit risk.
The credit risk for liquid funds and other short-term financial assets is considered small. The substantial majority of these assets are 
deposited with NatWest.
Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk arises from the Group’s management of working capital and the finance charges and principal repayments on its debt 
instruments. It is the risk that the Group will encounter difficulty in meeting its financial obligations as they fall due.
In order to maintain liquidity to ensure that sufficient funds are available for ongoing operations and future developments, the Group 
monitors forecast cash inflows and outflows on a monthly basis.
Fair values of financial instruments
Financial assets and liabilities are carried at amortised cost which equates to fair value.

24 Acquisitions
On 12 July 2017 the Company acquired 100% of the equity of Brook Financial Services Limited (“Brook”), which trades as an appointed 
representative of Mortgage Advice Bureau, one of the UK’s leading networks for mortgage intermediaries. As part of the Belvoir Group, 
Brook will leverage its expertise to introduce new mortgage products and services across all Group networks, increasing the Group’s 
presence in the franchised property sector and opening up additional growth opportunities. Total consideration was £2,236,000, satisfied 
by £1,736,000 from existing cash resources and the issue of 475,162 new ordinary shares in Belvoir to the sole shareholder in Brook.
The transaction met the definition of a business combination and is accounted for using the acquisition method under IFRS 3. 
The assets and liabilities overleaf are shown at their book values which were assessed as also being the fair values at acquisition.
In addition Belvoir Yardley came under corporate ownership between 3 May 2017 and 1 November 2017 when it was resold 
to a new franchise owner, during which time it was operated as a corporate-owned outlet. 57 Annual report and accounts 2017 Belvoir Lettings plc

and unconditionally authorised for the purposes of Section 551 
of the Companies Act 2006 (as amended) (the “Act”) to exercise 
all the powers of the Company to allot shares in the Company, 
or to grant rights to subscribe for or to convert any security 
into shares in the Company being (such shares and such rights 
to subscribe for or to convert any security into shares in the

exclusions or other arrangements as the Directors of the Company 
may deem necessary or expedient to deal with any fractional 
entitlements or any legal or practical problems under the laws 
of, or the requirements of any regulatory body or any recognised 
stock exchange in, any territory, in each case at any time 
(unless the authority conferred by resolution 7 is previously 
renewed, revoked or varied) until the conclusion of the next 
Annual General Meeting of the Company or 15 months after

 The power granted by this resolution applies in relation to 
any sale or shares which in an allotment of equity securities by 
virtue of Section 560(3) of the Act as if in the first paragraph of 
this resolution the words “pursuant to the authority conferred

authorities to allot any shares in the Company and to grant rights 
to subscribe for or convert any security into shares in the Company 
previously granted to the Directors pursuant to Sections 551, 
570 and 573 of the Companies Act 2006, save for any existing 
authorities in respect of options granted to employees.
9. This resolution authorises the Company to purchase up to 
approximately 14.99% of its issued ordinary share capital at any 
time from the date this resolution is passed up to the date of the 
next Annual General Meeting or 15 months from the date this 
resolution is passed, whichever is the earlier. The Directors 
consider it desirable for the proposed general authority to be 
available. The Directors have no present intention to make such 
market purchases but consider it desirable to be given the 
flexibility to do so by shareholders.
