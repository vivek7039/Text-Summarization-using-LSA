Strategic report Chairman’s statement 
10 Rathbone Brothers Plc Report and accounts 2017 
 
 
A strong 2017 
2017 was a good year for Rath bones and we produced some 
robust financial results. The executive team responded well to 
developments in a rapidly changing wealth management market, 
and our investment managers achieved good risk-adjusted 
returns for our clients in a time of great uncertainty and 
persistently low interest rates.  
UK and global investment markets performed well in 2017, with 
some indices reaching record levels towards the end of the year. 
This outcome has been positive for both Rathbones and our 
clients, with the WMA Balanced Index up 7.2% in the year and  
our funds under management reaching £39.1 billion, up 14.3% in 
the year.  
Profit before tax for 2017 increased 17.6% to £58.9 million after 
incurring the costs associated with the relocation of our London 
office and in pursuing strategic opportunities. These costs were 
partially offset by a plan amendment gain arising from the closure 
of our defined benefit pension schemes. Accordingly, basic 
earnings per share of 92.7p in creased 17.5% from the 78.9p 
reported last year. A full analysis of all non-underlying items 
impacting profit before tax can be found on page 127. 
Underlying profit before tax was £87.5 million for the year ended  
31 December 2017, up 16.8% from the previous year, and we have 
continued to balance our need to continue strategic expenditure 
with maintaining good profitability, reporting an underlying profit 
margin of 30.6% (2016: 29.8%) for the year. Underlying earnings per 
share of 138.8p for 2017, increase d 13.7% from 122.1p last year.  
In line with our progressive dividend policy, the board is 
recommending a final dividend of 39.0p per share. This brings the 
total dividend for the year to 61.0p per share, an increase of 7.0% 
over last year.  
We continually monitor opportunities to grow the business 
through smaller acquisitions, but during the year we discussed 
with an industry peer, Smith & Williamson, the benefits of 
combining our businesses. The benefits to both parties and our 
respective clients could have been considerable, but, following 
extensive discussions, we were unable to conclude a transaction 
that was in the best interests of both parties. Nevertheless,  
I believe that our measured approach to this opportunity served 
us well. We will continue to apply this discipline when we pursue 
other opportunities.  
Continued momentum  
In 2014, we set out a five-year strategy which had the ambition to 
reach £40 billion of funds under management by the end of 2018. 
Accepting that investment market s have been favourable, we are 
now well within sight of that goal with many of our strategic 
initiatives continuing to gain momentum.  
Accordingly, over the next few months, the board and executive 
team will work to refresh our strategy to ensure our core business 
remains robust and that we can benefit from the changing 
landscape of our industry. I look forward to sharing the outcome  
of these discussions with our stak eholders at the appropriate time. 
We remain committed to ensuring that Rathbones remain  
well positioned for the future. 
Governance, culture and the board  
Last year, I wrote that one of my priorities was to ensure board 
oversight of the firm’s culture and its development. This is  
now one of my specific responsibilities. Rathbones’ culture 
(professionalism, putting clients first, a collegiate approach  
and integrity) has long been a competitive advantage.  
Despite growth, regulation and the pace of change in our  
industry, we have endeavoured to protect our culture and this 
remains a board priority. 
As part of this initiative, both I and my non-executive director 
colleagues actively seek opportunities for direct engagement with 
employees, both formal and informal, across the firm. From our 
engagement this year, we have witnessed the challenging effects 
that an increased workload, driv en by internal and external 
change, has placed on our teams. On the other hand, we have 
been reassured that our strong culture remains at the heart of  
the business. Preserving this culture is clearly fundamental  
to achieving the best results for clients and shareholders over  
the long term.  
  
10 Rathbone Brothers Plc Report and accounts 2017 rathbones.com  11  
As part of our normal succession planning, the board continues to 
monitor our existing capabilities and assess what new skills are 
necessary to develop both the boa rd and the wider business over 
time, taking into account the existing balance of knowledge, 
experience and diversity. After a rigorous recruitment process,  
we were delighted to welcome Jim Pettigrew to the board in 
March 2017. Jim has extensive experience in financial services  
and was appointed senior independ ent director in August 2017 
following the retirement of David Harrel. 
In late 2017, we completed an externally-facilitated board 
effectiveness review, which has confirmed that the board 
continues to operate well. There are always areas to improve 
however, and, in particular, we will ensure that good 
communication and interaction between the board and the 
business remains a priority. 
Responding to risks and regulation 
The report from the chairman of the group ri sk committee, 
Kathryn Matthews, is set out on page 68. We continue to enhance 
our risk management processes, and, this year, have paid 
particular attention to identifying and monitoring emerging risks 
such as cybercrime, money laundering and data theft. We remain 
vigilant to the financial risks associated with sub-letting our 
existing space in Curzon Street and these risks are also reviewed  
at every board meeting. We also took action to reduce the risks 
associated with our defined bene fit pension schemes. We believe 
that the other significant risks to our business are operational risks, 
which are increased by growth, and regulatory risks, which are 
increased by continual changes to regulations in our sector.  
The past year has been a very demanding one from a regulatory 
perspective as we prepared for the changes brought about by 
MiFID II (Markets in Financial Instruments Directive), the General 
Data Protection Regulation, the FCA’s Asset Management Market 
Report and PRIIPs (Packaged Retail and Insurance-based 
Investment Products). Maintaining our regulatory standards has 
always been a high priority for our senior management and we 
will continue to monitor the regulatory risks that arise from the 
changes to guidelines and standards in our sector. 
Engaging with shareholders 
During the year, we have had the opportunity to engage with 
shareholders through various channels including conferences, 
company-hosted events, group meetings and one-on-one 
discussions. We are fo rtunate to have a number of longstanding, 
committed institutional shareholders and will continue to 
maintain a regular and constructive dialogue with them to gather 
feedback on our progress.  
In early 2018, we consulted with them on changes to our 
remuneration policy. As it has been three years since our last 
policy was approved, a revised remuneration policy will be  
laid before shareholders for approval at the annual general 
meeting in May 2018. Working with the company’s advisers,  
the remuneration committee has reassessed our policy in the 
context of a changing external environment and the firm’s own 
future aspirations. Although we have maintained the principal 
features of our existing policy, some changes have been proposed 
to align the interests of executives and investors more closely. 
These changes follow a number of consultation meetings with 
shareholders and governing bodies. 
Listening to our employees  
As a service business, our people are our greatest asset and we are 
committed to retaining the many high-calibre individuals we 
employ across the firm and creating a stimulating and supportive 
environment for them. I listen carefully to the views of my 
colleagues and I recognise that this year has been a challenging 
one for employees, given the pace and nature of change. I am very 
grateful for their continued perseverance and dedication. 
Outlook 
The UK wealth management industry continues to evolve, driven 
by client needs, regulation, demographics, technological 
innovation and a changing competitive landscape. Rathbones, as a 
leading UK discretionary wealth manager, remains well placed to 
respond to and capitalise on these evolving trends. 
We remain committed to growing the business both organically, 
via disciplined investment, and inorganically, via acquisitions that 
not only fit our strategic and financial criteria, but also share our 
culture and values.  
Notwithstanding some caution, which naturally emerges at a time 
of high investment markets and political uncertainty, we enter 
2018 well positioned to provide long-term value for shareholders.

The wealth management sector  
remains robust 
The wealth management industry continues to be an exciting  
and rapidly changing place to do business. In 2017, the industry  
has not only had to navigate a particularly uncertain political 
climate, but has also had to respond to a considerable amount  
of new regulation.  
Importantly, many positive drivers for long-term private wealth 
accumulation are still in place. The challenge the current climate 
brings is to secure the scale economies and operational efficiencies 
necessary to respond positively to demographic changes and 
technological advances, whilst reacting to a climate of increasing 
price pressure.  
In this respect, Rathbones contin ues to be well positioned in  
the industry with our own funds under management reaching 
£39.1 billion at 31 December 2017, up 14.3% from £34.2 billion at the 
end of 2016. Total funds under management in our Investment 
Management business at 31 December 2017 were £33.8 billion, up 
11.9% from £30.2 billion in 2016, whilst our Unit Trusts business 
reached a milestone of £5.3 billion, up 32.5% from last year.  
Strong financial performance underpinned 
by a 30% operating margin 
Despite investing in a number of areas across the business during 
the year, we maintained a leading operating margin of 30.6%  
(2016: 29.8%) through a combination of relatively supportive 
investment markets and continued net funds growth and cost 
discipline. Underlying profit before tax totalled £87.5 million  
(2016: £74.9 million), generating an underlying earnings per share 
of 138.8p, an increase of 13 .7% from 122.1p in 2016.  
In 2017, the group added £4.8 billion gross funds under 
management organically, split between £3.1 billion in our 
Investment Management business and £1.7 billion in our Unit 
Trusts business (2016: £2.3 billion and £1.3 billion respectively). 
Outflows from intergenerational wealth transfer, property 
purchases and other uses of funds to support lifestyle continue 
unabated in this low interest rate environment. Net organic 
growth in this business was 3.0% (2016: 2.9%), which represents a 
satisfactory result in an investment climate that was largely 
directionless until the end of the year. Net flows into our Unit 
Trusts business were very strong however, totalling £883 million 
in the year (2016: £554 million) and helping its total funds under 
management to reach a record £5.3 billion (2016: £4.0 billion)  
at 31 December 2017.  
Profit before tax for the year of £58.9 million was 17.6% higher than 
the £50.1 million in 2016 and reflects the impact of a number of 
non-underlying items. A full analysis of these items can be found 
on page 31. 
As reported on page 116, our balance sheet remains stable with a 
consolidated Common Equity Tier 1 ratio at 31 December 2017 of 
20.7% compared with 17.7% at 31 December 2016. Our consolidated 
leverage ratio at 31 December 2017 was 7.8% compared with 6.6% 
at 31 December 2016. We remain a capital-efficient business, 
generating an underlying return on capital employed of 19.5% for 
the year compared to 19.3% a year ago. A detailed analysis of our

The journey to £40 billion has significantly 
improved our capabilities as a firm 
Four years ago, I shared an ambition for the firm to reach  
£40 billion of funds under management by the end of 2018,  
and I am encouraged that this goal is within our reach. Since 2014, 
we have delivered a significantly improved investment platform 
to support our investment teams, built new distribution channels 
addressing both IFA networks and professional intermediaries, 
acquired Vision Independent Financial Planning, expanded our 
research and specialist investment capabilities, simplified our 
pricing structures and materially grown our Unit Trusts business. 
We have also delivered learning and development programmes to 
employees, strengthened our brand profile, improved our website 
and broadened our marketing capability.  
Alongside this demanding programme, we have taken advantage 
of a number of opportunities to deliver inorganic growth through 
team hiring and bolt-on acquisitions. Our culture of ‘professional 
autonomy with accountability’ on which our investment 
managers thrive, remains very much at the heart of our business, 
but does place more demands on our ability to manage risk. Hand 
in hand with this considerable level of activity, we have ensured 
that we continue to operate a risk and control framework that 
allows us to adhere to our core philosophies of delivering an 
investment-led, highly personal, whole of market investment 
service to our clients.  
Investing in the future  
There are, of course, areas of the business that we must continue 
to develop to adapt to the changing needs of our clients. This year, 
we have been reviewing the processes we use to maintain and 
manage information about our clie nts, and have made a number 
of enhancements. In 2017, we embedded a new way of capturing 
and evaluating our clients’ attitude to investment risk and 
significantly increased the usage of asset allocation tools across  
the firm, with over 97% of discretionary funds now linked to  
these tools.  
In 2018, we will continue to keep abreast of evolving client 
suitability standards. We will also be looking to improve our 
account opening processes, making use of a material upgrade to 
our client relationship management systems and providing more 
administrative support to ensure that investment teams can 
continue to focus on serving our clients well.  
The output from our research team has increased considerably 
over the last two years, as has access to this output, through the 
introduction of a research hub, which disseminates information to 
our growing community of investment managers. In 2018, we will 
continue to ensure that we attract the right level of investment 
skills to support and develop our in vestment process, but, just as 
importantly, ensure that the amount of external research we 
procure is right for us. MiFID II (Markets in Financial Instruments 
Directive) has made some signif icant changes to the way in  
which external research is priced, delivered and administered,  
and we will work hard to keep abreast of developments to secure 
value for money.  
Building our presence in the inte rmediary market has remained a 
key priority, so a May 2017 report by Defaqto, which confirmed 
that the use of Rathbones as a discretionary fund management 
provider to advisers had more than doubled in the last year,  
was a good outcome. Vision Independent Financial Planning 
made strong progress during the year, growing funds under 
management to £1.4 billion (2016: £1.0 billion) and continuing to 
attract quality advisers. In addition, our specialist intermediary 
team continues to focus on a number of important strategic 
partnerships, and is now well established. We expect flows to 
improve from the £265 million introduced in 2017 to around  
£350 million as the proposition continues to gain momentum.  
This year, we deliberately invested in establishing the right 
infrastructure to support our internal financial planning teams and 
further develop the proposition. We are now able to expand its 
footprint across more of our regional offices over the next year  
and expect to increase the number of professional staff in 2018.  
In total, we expect net costs to increase by up to £1.5 million as a 
result. The Rathbone Private Office became fully operational 
during 2017, with a marketing programme positioning the firm  
as a credible alternative for larg er and more complex clients, and 
raising its profile within the intermediary community.  
We remain mindful that current employee ownership in the 
business is culturally important and over recent years there has 
been a decline, primarily as a result of retirement. From 2018,  
we will seek to correct this by creating opportunities for more 
employees to build a larger el ement of equity ownership.  
Finally, investment markets inevitably present an element  
of cyclicality to earnings and stock performance and we will 
continue to monitor this as we review and update our goals for  
the next five years.

Regulation and infrastructure  
continue to evolve 
In 2017, we and the industry have had the task of implementing 
the significant regulatory changes that arise from the introduction 
of MiFID II and the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in 
particular. Whilst MiFID II has be en successfully delivered on time 
and work on GDPR is advanced, these new regimes will continue 
to require some significant chan ges to our core processes and 
systems, with costs continuing at similar levels into 2018.  
MiFID II, in particular, will have an impact on our Unit Trusts 
business, which will bear the full cost of external research in 2018. 
Research costs borne by the funds in 2017 were £0.8 million.  
This is in addition to the expect ed ban on ‘risk-free’ box dealing 
profits (2017: £3.1 million) foll owing the FCA’s Asset Management 
Market Study. We will look to offset these impacts in profit terms 
by continuing to grow the business and build on the momentum 
the team has achieved.  
Technology continues to be a significant entrant in our sector and 
I believe it will continue to play a disruptive role in the future if not 
wholly embraced. Whilst we are committed to our highly personal 
approach to providing investment and advisory services, we will 
continue to invest to capture the opportunities that these new 
technologies can offer to improv e our services and operational 
efficiency while increasing the capacity of our investment teams.  
In 2017, we reorganised and upgraded the skills of our IT team, 
which over the medium term will improve our data management 
capabilities, enhance our client communications and introduce 
additional security measures to combat the ever-growing  
cyber threat. We expect that this expansion of our IT capability, 
together with more general cost inflation, will add approximately 
£2.5 million to our running costs.  
Outlook 
This year has presented many challenges and opportunities and 
I fully expect 2018 to do so in equal measure. Brexit continues to 
be a regular discussion topic wi thin the investment community, 
but, as a predom inantly UK-based firm, our own view is largely 
focused on the wider economic environment and any impact it 
may have on the investments we make for our clients. 
I would like to take this opportunity to praise the efforts of our 
employees in this eventful last year. Notwithstanding the 
demands of our own change programme and a complicated 
market environment, they have ke pt the needs of our clients at 
the forefront of what we do and concentrated on providing an 
exemplary service.  
We enter 2018 in a good position, with industry-leading operating 
margins and a strong balance sheet. We will continue to look for 
accretive acquisition opportunities and to invest in our future  
with discipline.

Strategic report Wider political and economic uncertainty remains as the 
UK economy begins the process of adjusting to a new 
relationship with the European Union. Demographics  
are also shifting and firms must respond to the evolving 
needs of clients in order to remain competitive.
Increased regulatory pressures mean firms will need to 
invest to keep up with the pace of change and capture 
market share.
 — The need for advice is increasing given the 
complexities surrounding the UK economy, tax 
requirements and regulatory changes 
 — The persistence of a lower interest rate environment 
continues to accentuate the need for investment
 — An ageing population with increased life expectancy 
increases the need to save for retirement and finance 
lifestyles over a longer period of time 
 — Increasing demands on clients’ time encourages 
them towards a full service investment solution
 — The trends for intergenerational wealth transfer, 
property purchases and other uses of funds to 
support lifestyle continue unabated
 — Demographic shifts will continue as millennials 
overtake baby boomers as the largest generation 
and bring evolving needs and requirements
 — Wealth management firms are well positioned to benefit 
from greater pension freedoms as declining levels of 
government and company pension support will 
encourage individuals to save
 — The weight of regulation is likely to create higher barriers 
to entry and lead to further industry consolidation 
 — More expenditure will be required to keep up with the 
pace of regulatory change
 — Regulatory changes could place pressure on the time 
investment teams can devote to delivering key services
The opportunities
The challenges
Stability in a changing market
Increased regulatory pressures, greater IT demands and the prospect of lower new wealth generation in the UK all mean firms 
will need to be at the forefront of innovation to capture market share. Alongside these pressures, the UK population is ageing 
while state and corporate sectors shift the burden of retirement on to individuals and families. Favourable savings trends 
overall though, twinned with ever-increasing tax complexities, will continue to drive further demand for wealth management 
services over the longer term, placing Rathbones in a strong position to proactively respond to developments in the market 
and provide a quality service for clients.

20 Rathbone Brothers Plc Report and accounts 2017 Risk management 
  Rathbone Brothers Plc Report and accounts 2017 21 
During 2017, we have continued to evolve our risk management approach in support of our ‘three  
lines of defence’ model. Our risk governance, risk processes and risk infrastructure have continued to 
mature to ensure our management of risk considers existing and emerging challenges. In 2018, we will 
maintain our approach and ensure that appropriate risk management is applied across the group to 
protect our stakeholders. 
Risk culture 
We believe that an appropriate risk culture enhances the 
effectiveness of risk management. The board is responsible for 
setting the right tone and, through our senior management team, 
encouraging characteristics and behaviours which support a 
strong risk culture. The considerat ion of risk is therefore accepted 
as being part of everyone’s day-to-day responsibilities and 
activities. Risk management is linked to performance and 
development, as well as to the group’s remuneration and reward 
schemes. The purpose of this is to create an open and transparent 
working environment, encouraging employees to engage 
positively in risk management and support the effective 
achievement of our strategic objectives. 
Three lines of defence 
We continue to apply a ‘three lines of defence’ model to support 
our risk management framework, with responsibility and 
accountability for risk management broken down as follows: 
First line: Senior management and operational business units are 
responsible for managing risks, by developing and maintaining 
effective internal controls to mitigate risk. 
Second line: The risk, compliance and anti-money laundering 
functions maintain a level of independence from the first line. 
They are responsible for providing oversight and challenge of the 
first line’s day-to-day management, monitoring and reporting of 
risks to both senior management and governing bodies. 
Third line: The internal audit function is responsible for providing 
independent assurance to both senior management and 
governing bodies as to the effectiveness of the group’s 
governance, risk management and internal controls. 
 
Risk appetite 
We define risk appetite as both the amount and type of risk the 
group is prepared to accept or retain in pursuit of our strategy.  
Our appetite is subject to regular review to ensure it remains 
aligned to our strategic goals. Our risk appetite framework contains 
some overarching parameters, alongside specific primary and 
secondary measures for each principal risk. At least annually, the 
board, executive committee and group risk committee will 
formally review and approve the group's risk appetite statement 
and assess whether the firm has operated in accordance with the 
stated risk appetite measures during the year. Notwithstanding 
the continued expectations for business growth, along with a 
strategic and regulatory change programme for 2018, the board 
remains committed to having a relatively low overall appetite for 
risk, ensuring that our internal controls mitigate risk to appropriate 
levels. The board recognises that the business is susceptible to 
fluctuations in investment markets and has the potential to bear 
losses from financial and operational risks from time-to-time, 
either as reductions in income or increases in operating costs. 
Identification and profiling of 
principal risks 
Our risks are classified using a hierarchical approach. The highest 
level (Level 1) comprises financial, conduct and operational risks. 
The next level (Level 2) contains 16 risk categories, each allocated to 
a Level 1 risk. Detailed risks (Level 3) are then identified as sub-sets 
of Level 2 risks. Level 3 risks ar e captured and maintained within 
our group risk register, which is the principal tool for monitoring 
risks. We recognise that some Level 2 and Level 3 risks have 
features which need to be considered under more than one Level 1 
risk, and this is facilitated in our framework thro ugh a system of 
primary and secondary co nsiderations. Our risk classification is 
regularly reviewed and takes a structured approach to the 
identification of all known material risks to the business and those 
emerging risks which may im pact future performance. 
Our risk exposures and overall risk profile are reviewed and 
monitored regularly, considering the potential impact, existing 
internal controls and management actions required to mitigate the 
impact of emerging issues and li kelihood of future events. To 
ensure we identify and manage our principal risks, reviews take 
place with risk owners, senior management and business units 
across the group. The risk function conducts these reviews and 
risk workshops regularly during the year.  
21 rathbones.com
Strategic report Risk management continued 
22 Rathbone Brothers Plc Report and accounts 2017 
A watch list is maintained to record any current, emerging or 
future issues, threats, business developments and regulatory or 
legislative change, which will or could have the potential to impact 
the firm’s current or future risk profile and therefore may require 
active risk management, usually through process changes or 
systems development. The group’s risk profile, risk register and 
watch list are regularly reviewed by the executive committee, 
senior management, board and group risk committee. 
We assess risks using a 1—4 scorin g system. Each Level 3 risk is 
rated by assessing the inherent likelihood of its occurrence in a 
five-year period and the associated impact. A residual risk score 
and overall risk rating of high, medium, low or very low is then 
derived for the five-year period by taking into account an 
assessment of the internal cont rol environment or insurance 
mitigation. The assessment of our control environment,  
carried out by senior management within the firm, includes 
contributions from first, second and third line data, monitoring 
and/or assurance activity. 
Risk assessment process 
The board and senior management are actively involved in a 
continuous risk assessment process as part of our risk 
management framework, supported by the annual Internal Capital 
Adequacy Assessment Process (ICAAP) and Internal Liquidity 
Adequacy Assessment Process (I LAAP) work, which assesses the 
principal risks facing the group. 
Stress tests include consideration of the impact of a number of 
severe but plausible events that could impact the business. The 
work also takes account of the availability and likely effectiveness 
of mitigating actions that could be taken to avoid or reduce the 
impact or occurrence of the underlying risks. 
Day-to-day, our risk assessment pr ocess considers both the impact 
and likelihood of risk events which could materialise, affecting the 
delivery of strategic goals and annual business plans. A top-down 
and bottom-up approach ensures th at our assessment of key risks 
is challenged and reviewed on a regular basis. The board and 
executive committee receive regular reports and information from 
senior management, operational business units, risk oversight 
functions and specific risk committees. 
The executive committee, group risk committee and other key 
risk-focused committees consider the risk assessments and 
provide challenge, which is reported through the governance 
framework and ultimately considered by the board.  
Profile and mitigation of principal risks 
As explained above, our risks are classified hierarchically in a 
three-level model. There are three Level 1 risks, 16 Level 2 risks and 
at Level 3 there are 44 risks, all of which form the basis of the 
group’s risk register.  
Our approach to managing risk continues to be underpinned by 
an understanding of our current risk exposures and consideration 
of how risks change over time.  
The underlying risk profile and ratings for the majority of Level 2 
risks have remained consistent during 2017. However, there have 
been some changes to risk ratings and the following table 
summarises the most important of these. 
Based upon the risk assessment processes identified above, the 
board believes that the principal risks and uncertainties facing  
the group have been identified. These reflect the impact of 
strategic and regulatory change in the year including, for example, 
MiFID II (Markets in Financial Instruments Directive) and the 
General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). The board remains 
vigilant to the risks associated with the pension schemes’ deficit 
and the sub-letting of vacant office space in London. Otherwise, 
the board continues to believe that the other key risks to the 
business are operational risks that arise from growth and 
regulatory risks that may arise from continual changes to rules 
and standards in our sector.

  Rathbone Brothers Plc Report and accounts 2017 23 
Our overall risk profile and control environment are described 
below. The board receives assurance from first line senior 
management that the systems of internal control are operating 
effectively and from the activities of the second line and third line 
that there are no material control issues which would affect the 
board’s view of its principal risks and uncertainties.  
In line with current guidance, we also include in the tables the 
potential impacts (I) the firm might face and our assessment of the 
likelihood (L) of each principal risk crystallising in the event it 
materialises. These assessments take into account the controls in 
place to mitigate the risks. However, as is always the case, should a 
risk materialise, a range of outcomes (both in scale and type) might 
be experienced. This is particularly relevant for firms such as 
Rathbones where the outcome of a risk event can be influenced 
by market conditions as well as internal control factors. 
We have used ratings of high, medium and low in this risk 
assessment. We perceive as high-risk items those which have  
the potential to impact the delivery of strategic objectives,  
with medium- and low-rated items having proportionately  
less impact on the firm. Likelihood is similarly based on a  
qualitative assessment. 
Emerging risks and threats 
Emerging risks, including legislative and regulatory change,  
have the potential to impact the group and its strategy. These risk  
factors are monitored through our watch list. During the year,  
the executive committee continued to recognise a number of 
emerging risks and threats to the financial services sector as a 
whole and to our business. We also recognise that the risk profile 
associated with outsourced activities can change over time and  
this will be an area of continued focus in 2018.  
In addition to the group’s view that we can reasonably expect 
current market conditions and uncertainties to remain throughout 
2018, other developing risks include, for example, cyber threats, 
regulatory change and scenar ios potentially arising from 
geopolitical developments, including Brexit. 
We are monitoring the potential consequences of Brexit very 
closely. Our current assessment is that the direct impacts of Brexit 
are manageable given our larg ely UK based business model. 
However, we are conscious that the position might change and 
could raise unexpected challenges and also that second order 
effects might have broader impacts on the UK economy as a whole. 
 
Ref Risk Description of change 
Risk change  
in 2017 
D Pension The schemes’ valuation and funding deficit decreased materially due to the closure of the 
schemes during the year with a significant number of members transferring benefits out of 
the schemes. However, this still remains an important risk for the firm to manage. 
 
F Performance and 
advice 
Our forward-looking risk assessment increased during the year, largely reflecting regulatory 
drivers. In addition to changes delivered in 20 17, we plan to improve our processes further in 
2018, including how we take on clients an d our approach to a ssessing suitability.  
 
G Regulatory Our risk assessment recognises the extent of regulatory change implemented in 2017, which 
continues into 2018, including, for exam ple, MiFID II optimisation and GDPR.  
  
K Data Integrity and 
security 
We have increased our risk rating in this ar ea based on our assessment of the increasing 
external threat profile, despite continuing investment in technology improvements.   
  
O People Although still regarded as a medium risk, ou r forward-looking risk assessment increased 
during the year, reflecting in dustry-wide trends. We also recognise the importance of 
addressing the drivers behind our gender pay gap over the coming years.

B Liquidity  
The risk of having insufficient 
financial resources to meet 
obligations as they fall due, or 
that to secure access to such 
resources would be at an 
excessive cost 
Low Low  This risk can arise through day-
to-day operations in so far as a 
significant proportion of client

The risk that regulatory own 
funds will be adversely 
affected by changes in the 
level or volatility of interest 
rates, foreign currency 
exchange rates or market

Low Low  This risk can arise through two 
primary areas: the exposure to 
mismatch between repricing 
of the firm’s own financial 
assets and liabilities and, to a 
lesser extent, transactional 
foreign exchange risk

D Pension  
The risk that the cost of 
funding our defined benefit 
pension schemes increases, 
or their valuation affects 
dividends, reserves and 
capital 
High High  This risk can arise through a 
sustained deficit between the 
schemes’ assets and liabilities. 
A number of factors impact a 
deficit, including increased life 
expectancy, falling interest 
rates and falling equity prices

Assessment of the company’s prospects 
The board prepares or reviews its strategic plan annually, 
completing the ICAAP and ILAAP work which form the basis for 
capital planning and regular discussion with the Prudential 
Regulation Authority (PRA). 
During the year, the board has considered a number of stress tests 
and scenarios which focus on mate rial or severe but plausible 
events that could impact the business and company’s financial 
position. The board al so considers the plans and procedures in 
place in the event that contingency funding is required to 
replenish regulatory capital. On a monthly basis, critical capital 
projections and sensitivities have been refreshed and reviewed, 
taking into account current or expected market movements and 
business developments. 
The board’s assessment considers all the principal risks identified 
by the group and assesses the suff iciency of our response to all 
Pillar 1 risks (credit, market and operational risks) to the required 
regulatory standards. In addition, the following risks were focused 
on for enhanced stress testing: equity market risk, interest rate risk, 
a loss of business/comp etition risk, business expansion risk and 
pension obligation risk.  
The group considers the possible impacts of serious business 
interruption as part of its operational risk assessment process and 
remains mindful of the importance of maintaining its reputation. 
Although the business is almost wholly UK-situated, it does not 
suffer from any material client, geographical or counterparty 
concentrations.  
Whilst this review does not consider all of the risks that the group 
may face, the directors consider that this stress testing-based 
assessment of the group’s pros pects is reasonable in the 
circumstances of the inherent uncertainty involved. 
 
Viability statement 
In accordance with the UK Corporate Governance Code, the board 
has assessed the prospects and viability of the group over a three-
year period taking into account the risk assessments (which are 
based upon a five-year period as detailed above). The directors 
have taken into account the firm’s current position and the 
potential impact of the principal risks and uncertainties set out 
above. As part of the viability statement, the directors confirm that 
they have carried out a robust assessment of both the principal 
risks facing the group, and stre ss tests and scenarios that would 
threaten the sustainability of its business model, future 
performance, solvency or liquidity.  
The board considers five-year projections as part of its annual 
regulatory reporting cycle, which includes strategic and 
investment plans and its opinio n of the likelihood of risks 
materialising. However, given the uncertainties associated with 
predicting the future impact of investment markets on the 
business over this longer period, the directors have determined 
that a three-year period to 31 December 2020 continues to 
constitute an appropriate period ov er which to provide its viability 
statement. This is more closely aligned to its detailed capital 
planning activity. 
Stress testing analysis shows that under scenarios such as a 45% 
fall in FTSE 100 levels or a 0% interest rate environment, the group 
would remain profitable and is able to withstand the impact of 
such scenarios. An example of a mitigating action in such 
scenarios would be a reduction in dividend. 
Based on this assessment, the directors confirm that they have a 
reasonable expectation that the co mpany will be able to continue 
in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due over the period 
to 31 December 2020.

4. Underlying profit after tax (note 13) as a % of average equity at each quarter end 
 
Underlying operating income 
Underlying operating income grew 13.8% in 2017, driven by higher 
investment markets and continued organic and acquired growth 
in all business areas. 
Fee income of £217.5 million in 2017 increased 17.7% compared to 
£184.8 million in 2016, reflecting positive markets and growth in 
organic and acquired new business over the period. Fee income 
represented 76.0% of total underlying operating income in the 
year ended 31 December 2017 (2016: 73.5%), as our fee only tariff 
becomes more widely adopted, helping to support our move to 
higher quality fee-based income.  
Net commission income of £38.7 million was broadly consistent 
with 2016, as the impact of higher trading volumes was offset by 
the greater number of accounts now operating on a fee only tariff. 
Net interest income was unchange d at £11.6 million, as higher 
liquidity offset the impact of a lo wer interest rate environment for 
much of 2017. 
A full reconciliation between underlying operating income and 
reported operating income is provided on page 128. 
Underlying operating expenses 
Underlying operating expenses increased by 12.5%, largely due to 
continuing investment in strategic initiatives and underlying 
growth in the business. 
In line with our strategy, planned additions to headcount 
increased fixed staff costs by 10.0 % to £87.8 million, with average 
headcount up 7.6% to 1,147. 
Total variable staff costs increased by 18.4% to £53.3 million, 
principally driven by growth in profits and funds under 
management as well as the introduction of additional 
performance-based incentives for investment managers during 
the year. Variable staff costs in 2017 represented 18.6% 
of underlying operating income (2016: 17.9%) and 37.9% of 
underlying profit before variable staff costs and tax (2016: 37.5%). 
Underlying operating expenses also included £5.1 million 
(2016: £4.0 million) for awards payable to new investment 
managers for the introduction of new clients where those 
managers have been in situ for more than 12 months (see 
note 2.1 to the financial statements).  
The adoption of IFRS 15 in 2018 requires us to change the 
accounting policy for these awards, which will result in more of 
these costs being capitalised and amortised over the life of the 
client relationship. The adoption of IFRS 9 is not expected to have 
a material impact on our financial performance. Further details can 
be found in note 1.3. 
  
30 Rathbone Brothers Plc Report and accounts 2017 rathbones.com  31  
Outlook 
Profitability 
Staff costs in 2018, will reflect the full year impact of hiring activity 
in 2017 in addition to salary inflation of around 3.5%. 
During 2018, we plan to continue the IT change programme 
started in 2017. This is expected to add approximately £2.5 million 
to our cost base in 2018. We also plan to expand the footprint of 
our financial planning service across more regional offices, which 
is expected to add up to £1.5 million to the cost base of this 
business, net of growth in associated revenues. 
In addition, from 2018, the Unit Trusts business will no longer 
charge research costs to the funds and it is expected that 
managers’ box dealing profits will no longer be retained. In 2017, 
research costs of £0.8 million were incurred by the funds and 
managers’ box dealing profits totalled £3.1 million. 
Capital expenditure 
Overall, capital expenditure of £11.3 million in 2017 was down  
£3.8 million compared to 2016, a fall of 25.2%. As planned, 
expenditure on software increased by £4.2 million as we upgraded 
our client relationship management systems and embarked on an 
IT change programme. These activi ties are expected to continue 
into 2018 with a similar level of capital expenditure. 
Premises related capital expenditure fell by £7.8 million, primarily 
due to the fit out of our new London Head Office, which was 
largely completed in 2016. 
 
Group underlying profit before 
tax/operating margin 
Underlying profit before tax and earnings per share are considered 
by the board to be a better reflection of true business performance 
than looking at our results on a statutory basis only. These 
measures are widely used by re search analysts covering the 
group. Underlying results exclude income and expenditure  
falling into the four cate gories explained below. 
Underlying profit before tax grew by 16.8% to £87.5 million in 2017. 
The underlying operating margin, which is calculated as the ratio 
of underlying profit before tax to underlying operating income, 
was 30.6% for the year, in line with our target of 30% over the cycle 
(2016: 29.8%). Profit before tax increased by 17.6% to £58.9 million 
for the year.

Gain on plan amendment of defined benefit pension 
schemes (note 27) 
With effect from 30 June 2017, we closed the defined benefit 
pension schemes, ceasing all future accrual and breaking the link 
to salaries. These changes resulted in a plan amendment gain of 
£5.5 million, which was recognised in operating income. This gain 
is a significant one-off item which does not relate to the trading 
performance of the business and it has therefore been excluded 
from underlying results. 
Charges in relation to client relationships and 
goodwill (note 21) 
As explained in notes 1.14 and 2.1, client relationship intangible 
assets are created when we acquire a business or a team of 
investment managers. The charges associated with these assets 
represent a significant non-cash item and they have, therefore, 
been excluded from un derlying profit, which represents largely 
cash-based earnings more directly relating to the reporting period. 
Charges for amortisation of client relationship intangibles in the 
year ended 31 December 2017 were £11.7 million (2016: £11.8 
million), reflecting historic acquisitions.

Acquisition-related costs (note 8) 
Acquisition-related costs are significant costs which arise from 
strategic investments to grow the business. They primarily relate 
to corporate actions rather than trading performance and are 
therefore excluded from underlying results. 
As announced on 31 August 2017, we incurred professional 
services costs of £4.9 million in relation to the me rger discussions 
with Smith & Williamson. 
Costs of £1.3 million (2016: £6.0 million) were incurred in relation  
to the acquisitions of Vision Independent Financial Planning  
and Castle Investment Solutions, which were completed on  
31 December 2015. These amounts include the cost of payments  
to vendors of the business who remain in employment with the 
group, as required by accounting standards. Further costs totalling 
£3.6 million will be charged to the income statement on a straight 
line basis over the deferral period ending in 2019. 
Head office relocation costs (note 9) 
During February 2017, we moved our London head office to the 
new premises following a nine-month fit-out period. Charges 
incurred in relation to the double running of both London 
premises and the relocation amounted to £16.2 million in 2017 
(2016: £7.0 million).  
As described in note 25, following the vacation of 1 Curzon Street, a 
provision has been recognised for the discounted value of the cost 
of the surplus property until the en d of the existing lease, net of 
any expected rental income from su b-letting the space. As a result, 
net charges totalling £14.1 million were recognised in the income 
statement during 2017 in relation to the onerous lease provision. 
Charges of £2.1 million were also incurred during the year for 
professional fees, accelerated de preciation and double running 
costs (2016: £7.0 million). These costs represent an investment to 
expand our operating capacity in a key location and are not 
expected to recur in the short to medium term; they have 
therefore been excluded from underlying results. 
Taxation 
The corporation tax charge for 2017 was £12.1 million (2016: £11.9 
million) and represents an effective tax rate of 20.5% (2016: 23.8%). 
A full reconciliation of the income tax expense is provided in note 
11 to the financial statements. 
The Finance Bill 2016, which included provisions for the UK 
corporation tax rate to be reduced to 17% in April 2020, from  
19% in April 2017, gained royal assent in September 2016. Deferred 
tax balances have therefore been calculated based on these 
reduced rates where timing differ ences are forecast to unwind  
in future years. 
Basic earnings per share 
Basic earnings per share for the year ended 31 December 2017 
were 92.7p compared to 78.9p in 2016. This reflects the full impact 
of non-underlying income and charges and the issue of 0.6 million 
shares to satisfy share-based remu neration scheme awards. On an 
underlying basis, earnings per share increased by 13.7% to 138.8p in 
2017 (see note 13 to the financial statements). 
Dividends 
We operate a generally progressive dividend policy, as set out in 
the directors’ report on page 104. 
In determining the level of any proposed dividend, the board has 
regard to current and forecast financial performance. Any proposal 
to pay a dividend is subject to compliance with the Companies 
Act, which requires that the company must have sufficient 
distributable reserves from which to pay the dividend. The 
company’s distributable reserves are primarily dependent on: 
— compliance with regulatory capital requirements for the 
minimum level of own funds 
— the level of profits earned by the company, including distributions 
received from trading subsidiari es (some of which are subject 
to minimum regulatory capital requirements themselves) 
— actuarial changes in the value of the pension schemes that are 
recognised in the company’s other comprehensive income,  
net of deferred tax. 
At 31 December 2017, the company’s distributable reserves were 
£63.9 million (2016: £42.8 million). 
In light of the results for the year, the board has proposed a final 
dividend for 2017 of 39.0p. This results in a full year dividend of 
61.0p, an increase of 4.0p on 2016 (7.0%). The proposed full year 
dividend is covered 1.5 times by basic earnings and 2.3 times by 
underlying earnings. 
Return on capital employed 
The board monitors the return on capital employed (ROCE) as a 
key performance measure, which fo rms part of the assessment of 
management’s performance for remuneration purposes as 
described in the remuneration report on page 80. For monitoring 
purposes, ROCE is defined as unde rlying profit after tax expressed 
as a percentage of quarterly average total equity across the year.  
Consideration of the return on capital is a key consideration in all 
investment decisions, particularly in relation to acquired growth. 
In 2017, ROCE was 19.5% (2016: 19.3%).

The activities of the group are described in detail on pages 2 to 9. 
The Investment Management segment comprises those activities 
described under the headings ‘Investment Management’ and 
‘Complementary services’ on pages 2 to 3. 
The financial performance of Investment Management is 
largely driven by revenue margins earned from funds under 
management. Revenue margins are expressed as a basis point 
return, which depends on a mix of tiered fee rates, commissions 
charged for transactions undertaken on behalf of clients and the 
interest margin earned on cash in client portfolios and client loans.

Funds under management 
Investment Management funds under management increased by 
11.9% to £33.8 billion at 31 December 2017 from £30.2 billion at the 
start of the year. This increase is analysed in table 4.

Net organic growth in our Investment Management business was 
3.0% (2016: 2.9%). This was below the 5% target we have set for 
ourselves, in large part due to an investment climate that was 
largely directionless until the end of the year. We saw outflows of 
approximately 7% of funds under management, as clients 
continued to transfer wealth to younger generations, purchase 
property and use capital to support income during the year. 
Charity funds under management continued to grow strongly and 
reached £4.7 billion at 31 December 2017, up 14.6% from £4.1 billion 
at the start of the year. 
We also retained our strategic focus on intermediaries during the 
year. Funds under management in accounts linked to 
independent financial advisers and provider panel relationships 
increased by £1.0 billion during 2017, ending the year at £7.7 billion.

In total, net organic and acquired growth added £1.2 billion to 
Investment Management funds under management in 2017  
(2016: £1.2 billion), representing an underlying rate of total net 
growth of 3.9% (2016: 4.5%). 
As at 31 December 2017, Vision Independent Financial Planning 
advised on client assets of £1.4 billion, up 35.9% from 2016. 
Average investment returns across all Investment Management 
clients were positive and outper formed the MSCI WMA Balanced 
Index by 1.8%. This outperformance was generated across  
both UK and overseas equities as the global markets rallied on  
US President Trump’s potential fiscal stimulus, stronger European 
economic data and the dollar trending lower throughout the year. 
Our overweight position in UK equities generated the greatest 
outperformance for 2017. Overall performance against other 
competitor indices, such as the Private Client Indices published  
by ARC, was robust.

1. Based on the corresponding valuation dates for billing 
In 2017, net commission income of £38.7 million was broadly 
consistent with 2016. Higher trading volumes offset the impact of 
the greater number of accounts operating on a fee only tariff. 
Net interest income of £11.6 mi llion in the year was unchanged 
from 2016. The impact of lower base rates during much of 2017 
was offset by a higher balance of cash in client portfolios over the 
course of the year. Cash held at the Bank of England grew from  
£1.1 billion at 31 December 2016 to £1.4 billion at the end of 2017. 
The Investment Management loan book grew to £120.5 million by 
the end of the year and contributed £3.1 million to net interest 
income in 2017 (2016: £3.0 million). Also included in net interest 
income is £1.3 million (2016: £1.3 million) of interest payable on the 
Tier 2 notes which are callable in August 2020. 
As shown in table 7, the average net operating basis point return 
on funds under management has fallen by 1.5 bps to 72.7 bps in 
2017. This largely reflects the changes in business mix and the fee 
tiering impact of higher market levels.

Fees from advisory services an d other income increased 18.4%  
to £14.8 million. This largely reflects a higher level of advisory fees 
earned by Vision, following a slower period of activity last year  
as the business completed a comprehensive file review exercise, 
and growth in in-house financial planning revenues. 
Underlying operating expenses in Investment Management for 
2017 were £177.8 million, compared to £160.1 million in 2016, an 
increase of 11.1%. This is highlighted in table 8.

Fixed staff costs of £59.5 million increased by 3.3% year-on-year, 
principally reflecting a 5.9% increase in average headcount and 
salary inflation. 
As results improved, variable staf f costs, also increased by 24.1% 
reflecting both the higher profitability in the period and an 
improved investment performance element for growth awards. 
Other operating expenses of £78.1 million include property, 
depreciation, settlement, IT, finance and other central support 
services costs. The year-to-year increase of £8.0 million (11.4%) 
reflects increased investment in the business, recruitment and 
higher variable awards in support departments in line with overall 
business performance.

Net retail sales in the asset management industry of 
approximately £47 billion were up around £40 billion on 2016,  
as reported by the Investment Association (IA). The IA pointed 
specifically to substantial growth of inflows into ethical funds,  
with sustainable investment becomi ng an “increasing priority for 
today’s investors”. The industry funds under management total 
reached a record £1.2 trillion by the end of the year, up around 15% 
on the total at the end of 2016. 
In total, the IA sectors in which we manage funds saw net inflows 
of £11.9 billion, compared to net outflows of £6.1 billion in 2016. 
Gross sales in those sectors were up 31.7% at £99.8 billion in 2017. 
In line with these trends, positive momentum in sales of our funds 
continued through 2017, with gross sales up 30.8% in the year to 
£1.7 billion. Redemptions also re mained elevated in 2017 at  
£0.9 billion (2016: £0.7 billion), reflecting the increased levels  
of disinvestment seen across the industry. This level of net sales 
put us in the top 20 fund managers for 2017, according to the 
Pridham Report. 
Net inflows of £0.9 billion (2016: £0.6 billion) continued to be 
spread across the range of funds, although the Ethical Bond Fund 
saw particularly strong net flows in the year, nearly doubling in 
size to £1.1 billion by the end of the year. As a result, Unit Trusts 
funds under management closed the year up 32.5% at £5.3 billion 
(see table 10). 
At 31 December 2017, we managed £428 million via the 
Luxembourg-based feeder funds, up 95.4% from £219 million  
at the end of 2016.

During the year, the retail and multi asset funds delivered strong 
positive returns and a solid perf ormance against their relevant 
benchmarks. The Global Opportunities Fund benefited from a 
high exposure to US equities and a substantial weighting to 
technology stocks. Both fixed in come funds delivered excellent 
returns and effectively managed volatility, with the Ethical Bond 
Fund recording the best return of any fund in its sector. The UK 
Opportunities Fund’s exposure to mid- and small-cap names 
contributed to a top quartile performance.

Whilst the Income and Blue Chip Funds generated positive 
returns over the year, both under-performed compared to other 
funds in the UK equity income sector due to the more defensive 
positioning of the portfolios and a small number of stock-specific 
issues. The multi asset range of funds outperformed their risk 
adjusted benchmarks and added value through their increased 
exposure to direct equities.

As at 31 December 2017, 88% of holdings in Unit Trusts retail funds 
were in institutional units (31 December 2016: 85%). 
During 2017, the total number of investment professionals in 
Unit Trusts decreased to 13 at 31 December 2017 from 14 at the 
end of 2016. 
Financial performance 
Unit Trusts income is primarily derived from: 
— annual management charges, which are calculated on the daily 
value of funds under management, net of rebates and trail 
commission payable to intermediaries 
— net dealing profits, which are earned on the bid-offer spread 
from sales and redemptions of units and market movements 
on the stock of units that are held on our books overnight. 
Net annual management charges increased 30.2% to £28.0 million 
in 2017, driven principally by the rise in average funds under 
management. Net annual management charges as a percentage 
of average funds under management fell to 60 bps (2016: 62 bps), 
reflecting the strong growth in the Ethical Bond Fund, which levies 
a lower rate of annual management charges.

In 2017, the cost of Unit Trusts compliance team was absorbed  
into the central compliance function and recharged as an  
inter-segment charge. 
Variable staff costs of £7.2 mill ion were 35.8% higher than the  
£5.3 million in 2016 as higher profitability and growth in gross  
sales drove increases in profit share and sales commissions.  
Other operating expenses have increased by 31.3% to £10.5 million, 
reflecting an increase in third party administration costs in line 
with growth in the business and higher inter-segment charges for 
the central compliance and distribution teams.

Capital resources 
Rathbones is classified as a banking group for regulatory capital 
purposes and is therefore required to operate within the 
restrictions on capital resources and banking exposures prescribed 
by the Capital Requirements Regulation, as applied in the UK by 
the Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA). 
At 31 December 2017, the group’s regulatory capital resources 
(including verified profits for the year) were £216.8 million (2016: 
£174.2 million).

1. Net book value of goodwill, client rela tionship intangibles and software are 
deducted directly from capital resources 
Common Equity Tier 1 capital (CET1) resources increased by  
£43.6 million during 2017, largely due to the inclusion of verified 
profits for the 2017 financial year, net of dividends paid in the year, 
and post-tax actuarial gains of £14.4 million arising from the 
remeasurement of defined benefit pension schemes. 
The CET1 ratio has grown to 20.7% from 17.7% at the previous year 
end in line with the growth in CET1 resources. Our consolidated 
CET1 ratio is higher than the banking industry norm, reflecting the 
low risk nature of our banking activity.  
The leverage ratio was 7.8% at 31 December 2017, up from 6.6% at 
31 December 2016. The leverage ratio represents our CET1 capital 
as a percentage of our total assets , excluding intangible assets, plus 
certain off balance sheet exposures. 
The business is primarily funded by equity, but also supported by 
£20 million of 10-year Tier 2 subordinated loan notes. The notes 
introduce a small amount of gearing into our balance sheet as a 
way of financing future growth in a cost-effective and capital-
efficient manner. They are repayable in August 2025, with a call 
option for the issuer in August 2020 and annually thereafter. 
Interest is payable at a fixed rate of 5.856% until the first call  
option date and at a fixed margin of 4.375% over six-month 
London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) thereafter (note 26). 
The consolidated balance sheet remains healthy with total equity 
of £363.3 million at 31 December 2017, up 11.9% from £324.8 million 
at the end of 2016, primarily reflecting retained profits for the year 
and an improvement in the reported position of our defined 
benefit pension schemes.

Own funds and liquidity requirements 
As required under PRA rules, we perform an Internal Capital 
Adequacy Assessment Process (ICAAP) and Internal Liquidity 
Adequacy Assessment Process (ILAAP) annually, which include 
performing a range of stress tests to determine the appropriate 
level of regulatory capital and liquidity that we need to hold. In 
addition, we monitor a wide range of capital and liquidity statistics 
on a daily, monthly or less frequent basis as required. Surplus 
capital levels are forecast on a monthly basis, taking account of 
proposed dividends and investment requirements, to ensure that 
appropriate buffers are maintained. Investment of proprietary 
funds is controlled by our treasury department. 
We are required to hold capital to cover a range of own funds 
requirements, classified as Pillar 1 and Pillar 2. 
Pillar 1 – minimum requirement for capital 
Pillar 1 focuses on the determinat ion of risk-weighted assets and 
expected losses in respect of the group’s exposure to credit, 
counterparty credit, market and operational risks and sets a 
minimum requirement for capital. 
At 31 December 2017, the group’ s risk-weighted assets were  
£977.2 million (2016: £892.7 million). 
Pillar 2 – supervisory review process 
Pillar 2 supplements the Pillar 1 minimum requirement with a 
firm-specific Individual Capital Guidance (Pillar 2A) and a 
framework of regulatory capital buffers (Pillar 2B). 
The Pillar 2A own funds requirement (which is set by the PRA) 
reflects those risks, specific to the firm, which are not fully 
captured under the Pillar 1 own funds requirement. 
Our Pillar 2A own funds requirement was reviewed by the PRA 
during 2017 and we have agreed a revised requirement. This 
includes the incorporation of a higher Pillar 2A requirement in 
respect of pension risk. 
Pension obligation risk 
The potential for additional unplanned capital strain or costs  
that the group would incur in the event of a significant 
deterioration in the funding position of the group’s defined  
benefit pension schemes. 
Interest rate risk in the banking book 
The potential losses in the no n-trading book resulting from 
interest rate changes or widening of the spread between Bank  
of England base rates and LIBOR rates. 
Concentration risk 
Greater loss volatility arising from a higher level of loan default 
correlation than is assumed by the Pillar 1 assessment. 
The group is also required to maintain a number of Pillar 2B 
regulatory capital buffers, all of which must be met with  
CET1 capital. 
Capital conservation buffer (CCB) 
The CCB is a general buffer, designed to provide for losses in the 
event of a stress and is being phased in from 1 January 2016 to  
1 January 2019. As at 31 December 2017, the buffer rate was 1.25%  
of risk-weighted assets. On 1 January 2018, it increased to 1.875%  
of risk-weighted assets and it wi ll finally increase to 2.5% of  
risk-weighted assets from 1 January 2019. 
Countercyclical capital buffer (CCyB) 
The CCyB is designed to act as an incentive for banks to constrain 
credit growth in times of heighten ed systemic risk. The amount of 
the buffer is determined by reference to rates set by the Bank of 
England Financial Policy Commi ttee (FPC) from time-to-time, 
depending on prevailing market conditions, for individual 
countries where the group has credit risk exposures.  
The buffer rate is currently set at zero for the UK. However, non-
zero rates for Norway, Sweden and Hong Kong, where the group 
has small relevant credit risk exposures, result in an overall rate of 
0.01% of risk-weighted assets for the group as at 31 December 2017. 
The FPC has announced the rate for UK exposures will increase to 
0.5% with effect from June 2018 and to 1.0% with effect from 
November 2018. 
PRA buffer 
The PRA also determines whether any incremental firm-specific 
buffer is required, in addition to the CCB and the CCyB. The PRA 
requires any such buffer to remain confidential between the group 
and the PRA.

The surplus of own funds (including verified profits for the full 
year) over total Pillar 1 and 2A own funds requirements and CRD 
IV buffers was £74.0 million, up from £63.3 million at the end  
of 2016. 
In managing the group’s regulatory capital position over the next 
few years, we will continue to be mindful of: 
— future volatility in pension scheme valuations which affect 
both the level of CET1 own funds and the value of the Pillar 2A 
requirement for pension risk 
— the staged introduction of incremental CRD IV buffers over the 
next two years 
— regulatory developments 
— the demands of future acquisitions which generate intangible 
assets and, therefore, direct ly reduce CET1 resources. 
We keep these issues under constant review to ensure that any 
necessary capital raising activities are carried out in a planned and 
controlled manner.  
The group’s Pillar 3 disclosures are published annually on our 
website (rathbones.com/investor-relations/results-and-
presentations) and provide further details about regulatory capital 
resources and requirements. 
Total assets 
Total assets at 31 December 2017 were £2.7 billion (2016: £2.4 
billion), of which £2.2 billion (2016: £1.9 billion) represents the cash 
element of client portfolios that is held as a banking deposit. 
Treasury assets 
As a licensed deposit taker, Rathbone Investment Management 
holds our surplus liquidity on its balance sheet together with 
clients’ cash. Cash in c lient portfolios as held on a banking basis of 
£2.2 billion (2016: £1.9 billion) represented 6.4% of total investment 
management funds at 31 December 2017, compared to 6.3% at the 
end of 2016. Cash held in client money accounts was £4.5 million 
(2016: £4.5 million). 
The treasury department of Rathbone Investment Management, 
reporting through the banking commi ttee to the board, operates in 
accordance with procedures set out in a board-approved treasury 
manual and monitors exposure to market, credit and liquidity risk 
as described in note 31 to the financial statements. It invests in a 
range of securities issued by a relatively large number of 
counterparties. These counterparties must be single ‘A’-rated or 
higher by Fitch and are regula rly reviewed by the banking 
committee. During the year, we increased the share of treasury 
assets held with the Bank of Englan d to £1.4 billion from £1.1 billion 
at 31 December 2016, reflecting the increase in the level of cash 
held in client portfolios over the period and a consistent appetite 
for credit risk. 
Loans to clients 
Loans are provided as a service to Investment Management 
clients who have short- to medi um-term cash requirements. Such 
loans are normally made on a fully-secured basis against portfolios 
held in our nominee name, requiring two times cover, and are 
usually advanced for up to one year (see note 16 to the financial 
statements). In addition, charges may be taken on property held 
by the client to meet security cover requirements. 
All loans (and any extensions to the initial loan period) are subject 
to review by the banking committee. Our ability to provide such 
loans is a valuable additional service, for example, to clients who 
require bridging finance when moving home. 
Loans advanced totalled £120.5 million at the end of 2017  
(2016: £106.3 million). 
  
40 Rathbone Brothers Plc Report and accounts 2017 rathbones.com  41  
Intangible assets 
Intangible assets arise principally from acquired growth in funds 
under management and are categorised as goodwill and client 
relationships. At 31 December 2017, the total carrying value of 
intangible assets arising from acquired growth was £151.7 million 
(2016: £160.7 million). During the year, client relationship intangible 
assets of £2.7 million were capitalised (2016: £7.9 million). No goodwill 
was acquired during 2017 (2016: £nil). 
Client relationship intangibles are amortised over the estimated 
life of the client relationship, generally a period of 10 to 15 years. 
When client relationships are lost, any related intangible asset is 
derecognised in the year. The total amortisation charge for client 
relationships in 2017, including the impact of any lost relationships, 
was £11.4 million (2016: £11.7 million).  
Goodwill which arises from business combinations is not 
amortised, but is subject to a test for impairment at least annually. 
During the year, the goodwill relating to the trust and tax business 
was found to be impaired as the gr owth forecasts for that business 
have not kept pace with cost inflation. An impairment charge of 
£0.3 million was recognised in relation to this element of goodwill 
(2016: £0.1 million). Further detail is provided in note 21 to the 
financial statements. 
As described in note 1.3 to the financial statements, the adoption of 
IFRS 15 in 2018 requires us to change the accounting policy for 
these awards. Currently, the cost of awards for funds introduced 
by investment managers who have been in situ for more than  
12 months are charged to profit or loss (2017: £5.1 million).  
Under the new accounting standard, these amounts will also be 
capitalised and amortised over the life of the client relationship. 
Capital expenditure 
During 2017, we have continued to invest for future growth with 
capitalised expenditure on our premises and systems totalling 
£11.3 million (2016: £15.1 million). As noted above, capital 
expenditure in 2016 included £9.9 million for the fit out of the new 
London head office. Further costs of £2.8 million were incurred to 
complete this in 2017. 
Investment in new systems accelerated in 2017 with the 
development of a new client relationship management (CRM) 
system. Total costs of £7.1 million for the purchase and 
development of software were incurred in 2017 (2016: £2.9 million). 
Excluding the London office fit-out costs, new investment 
accounted for approximately 79% of capital expenditure in 2017 
(2016: 67%), with the balance be ing maintenance and replacement 
of existing software and equipment. This is more weighted to new 
investment than in prior years due to the development of the 
CRM system and improvements relating to the introduction of 
MiFID II (Markets in Financial Instruments Directive) and the 
General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). 
Defined benefit pension schemes 
We operate two defined benefit pension schemes, both of which 
have been closed to new members for several years. With effect 
from 30 June 2017, we closed both schemes, ceasing all future 
benefit accrual and breaking the link to salary. The closure of the 
schemes resulted in a £5.5 mill ion improvement in the reported 
position of the schemes. 
The member consultation to close the scheme coincided with a 
period of historically exceptiona lly low yields on the government 
bonds that are used to derive cash equivalent transfer values 
(CETVs) for members wishing to ex it the scheme, increasing the 
value of these CETVs markedly. Th is resulted in a significant 
increase in the number of members seeking to transfer their 
benefits out of the scheme by taking a cash lump sum and over 
the course of 2017, members transferred benefits with cumulative 
CETVs of £60.6 million out of the scheme. This reduced the 
accounting value of the liabilities of the Laurence Keen Scheme by 
17% and the Rathbone 1987 Scheme by 29% compared to the 
position at 31 December 20 16 and helped support an 
improvement in the schemes’ deficit and funding levels. 
As a result of the large value of transfers out, the accounting 
valuation of the schemes’ liabilities has also fallen. At 31 December 
2017 the combined schemes’ liabilities, measured on an 
accounting basis, had fallen to £164.1 million, down 29.4% from 
£232.4 million at the end of 2016. Reflecting the performance of the 
schemes’ assets over the course of the year, the reported position 
of the schemes at 31 December 2017 was a deficit of £15.6 million 
(2016: deficit of £39.5 million). 
Triennial funding valuations form the basis of the annual 
contributions that we make in to the schemes. During 2017, 
funding valuations of the schemes as at 31 December 2016 were 
being carried out. We have agr eed with the trustees of the 
Rathbone 1987 Scheme to put in place a funding deficit reduction 
plan, which requires annual contribu tions of £2.75 million, so long 
as that scheme remains in deficit. The funding valuation for the 
Laurence Keen Scheme has not yet been finalised but we do not 
expect that it will result in a material funding deficit reduction plan.

Net change in cash and cash equivalents 304.7 559.5 
Fee income is largely collected directly from client portfolios and 
expenses, by and large, are predic table. Consequently, we operate 
with a modest amount of working capital. Larger cash flows are 
principally generated from banking and treasury operations when 
investment managers make asset allocation decisions about the 
amount of cash to be held in client portfolios. 
As a bank, we are subject to the PRA’s ILAAP regime, which 
requires us to hold a suitable Li quid Assets Buffer to ensure  
that short-term liquidity requirements can be met under certain 
stressed scenarios. Liquidity ri sks are actively managed on  
a daily basis and depend on operational and investment 
transaction activity. 
Cash and balances at central banks was £1.4 billion at 31 December 
2017 (2016: £1.1 billion). 
Cash and cash equivalents, as defined by accounting standards, 
includes cash, money market funds and banking deposits, which 
had an original maturity of less than three months (see note 36 to 
the financial statements). Consequently, cash flows, as reported in 
the financial statements, include the impact of capital flows in 
treasury assets. 
Net cash flows from operating activities include the effect of a 
£282.6 million increase in banking client deposits (2016: £486.0 
million increase) and a £16.6 million increase in the component of 
treasury assets placed in term deposits for more than three 
months (2016: £16.8 million decrease). 
Offsetting this, cash flows included a net outflow of £4.0 million 
from the purchase of longer-dated certificates of deposit (2016: 
£7.0 million net inflow from the maturity of longer-dated 
certificates of deposit), which is shown within investing activities 
in the consolidated statement of cash flows. 
The most significant non-operating cash flows during the year 
were as follows. 
— outflows relating to the payment of dividends of £29.4 million 
(2016: £26.5 million) 
— outflows relating to payments to acquire intangible assets 
(other than as part of a business combination) of £11.9 million 
(2016: £14.0 million) 
— £4.2 million of capital expenditure on property, plant and

rathbones.com  43  
 
 
Chief executive’s annual statement on 
corporate responsibility 
Rathbones’ corporate responsibility strategy aims to ensure that 
social, environmental and ethical considerations are taken into 
account throughout the business. With regard to environmental, 
social and governance (ESG) matters as they affect our business, 
the board believes that the soci al and environmental committee 
(SEC) has identified and assessed the significant risks to the 
company. The SEC focuses not only on potential risks but also on 
opportunities for the company to play its part as a good employer 
and as a contributor to the environment and communities in 
which we work and our clients live. This report provides an 
overview of our activities – more information can be found on  
our website. 
As reported in last year’s report, 2017 marked the firm’s ten-year 
anniversary for reporting on carbon footprint and a review  
was conducted to align our environmental and sustainability 
objectives with the broader commercial goals of the business.  
The objective of this review was to set the framework for the firm’s 
corporate social responsibility (CSR ) strategy for the long term  
and develop key initiatives to ensure the sustainability of the firm. 
You will find further details below. 
Responsible investing  
The concept of stewar dship and responsible investment (SRI) 
means focusing on the client and ensuring an active approach to 
the ownership of securities. Implem enting effective stewardship is 
integral to our investment proces s as a means of protecting and 
enhancing value for clients, often through encouraging high 
standards of corporate governance. During 2017, we reviewed and 
updated our policies in this area and are pleased to report on our 
progress below. Also, we remain a constituent company of the 
FTSE4Good Index series and a signatory to the UN–backed 
Principles for Responsible Investment (PRI). 
Our employees 
Our business success is depend ent upon delivering a highly 
professional and personal service to our clients and we believe  
this can only be achieved by having engaged and motivated 
employees with a diverse rang e of skills and experience.  
Our employee strategy, policies and investment plans are all 
designed to achieve th ese goals. Members of staff have access to 
management and leadership courses, continuous professional 
development (CPD) programmes to achieve continuous learning 
and agreed career development programmes to enable 
progression within the firm.  
Charities and communities  
The Rathbone Brothers Foundations have continued to support 
small local charities where its donations can make a real 
difference. During the year, each office across the firm created a 
foundation in order to be able to donate to and support local 
charities. The overall charitable objective of the firm is to support 
small, locally-based charities that help to improve the lives of 
young people. Further information on our various initiatives can 
be found below.  
In 2017, Rathbones was lead sponsor of the FIL Rathbones 
Women’s Lacrosse World Cup, the largest international women’s 
sporting event in the UK that ye ar. As well as supporting and 
highlighting the importance of women’s sport, we used the 
opportunity to encourage young women in particular to get 
involved in sport through the tournament’s legacy programme 
and our ongoing partnerships with English Lacrosse and Lacrosse 
Scotland. Through our sponsorship of the Rathbones Folio Prize, 
we were also involved in the establishment of a mentoring 
programme for young writers.

Environmental reporting 
Despite the continued growth in our business, total carbon 
emissions were reduced to 2,553 tCO2e (‘tonnes carbon dioxide 
equivalent’), 9% lower than reported in 2016 and 10% lower than 
our baseline. Emissions from buildings energy consumption fell 
by 14% due to reduced energy use and the continued 
decarbonisation of the UK grid . Following a 17% increase in 
headcount, our business travel emissions increased slightly by 2%, 
despite a 7% reduction in emissions from flights. For further details 
of our carbon footprint, please read the environmental impact 
section of this report. 
This year also marks the 10-year anniversary of Rathbones 
reporting on its environmental impacts. In recognition of this 
milestone, we completed several initiatives in 2017 to improve  
our performance and further enhance our knowledge and 
management of environmental issues. We conducted an in- 
depth review of our wider sustainability strategy, improved our 
environmental management and reporting processes and 
completed our move to an award-winning, energy-efficient head 
office building at Finsbury Circus.

Our approach 
Rathbones’ corporate responsibility approach can be summarised 
as follows: 
— Investing for clients 
— Considering corporate responsibility and governance issues in 
the companies in which we inve st on behalf of our clients 
— Developing our employees 
— Motivating and rewarding our employees appropriately, 
encouraging their development 
— Working with communities 
— Engaging in the communit ies in which we operate 
— Being aware of our environment 
— Managing our environmental impact and reducing our carbon 
footprint by the efficient use of resources 
Responsible investment 
Rathbones specialises in discretionary private client investment 
management. We manage assets for clients based on their goals. 
Central processes provide guidance on equity analysis and 
strategic asset allocation advice and are shared by the group. But it 
is central to our business model that investment managers retain 
their independence to buy and sell securities for clients. Therefore, 
a top-down responsible investment framework is provided whilst 
maintaining investment flexibility for investment managers.  
Nonetheless, we are long-term investors and ESG factors form a 
key part of our equity analysis. To this end, in 2016, we formalised 
our approach to the long-term stew ardship of our clients’ assets 
with the approval of a group stewardship policy, which was 
approved by the board in 2017. The concept of our stewardship 
policy means taking a client first, active approach to the ownership 
of securities. Implementing effective stewardship is integral to our 
investment process as a means of protecting and enhancing value 
for clients. The core principles that we follow are:  
1 Materiality  
We recognise that governance and stewardship risks can be 
material to the performance and valuation of companies.  
2 Active voting  
We actively consider proxy votes for client holdings.  
3 Engagement  
Active engagement with companies on governance issues is 
an important adjunct to voting activities.  
4 Transparency  
We report annually on our stewardship activities.  
In addition, the issue of governance as a risk factor is covered by the 
work of our stewardship committee, recognising that governance 
44 Rathbone Brothers Plc Report and accounts 2017 rathbones.com  45  
issues can be material in the compan ies in which we invest on behalf 
of our clients. As well as conducting our own in-house analysis, we 
subscribe to specialist providers of ESG research as part of our 
research budget. Governance risk scoring is now integrated into the 
work of various investment committees. Social, environmental and 
ethical considerations are also taken into account for specific 
mandates throughout the group, particularly those managed by our 
specialist ethical investment unit, Rathbone Greenbank Investments, 
and a number managed by our charities team.  
Through Rathbone Greenbank Investments and Rathbone Unit 
Trust Management’s Ethical Bond Fund, the company is able to 
provide investment services tailored to clients’ interests in the area 
of socially responsible or sustainable investment. Where 
appropriate, the company is also able to participate in new share 
issues offered by companies th at provide environmentally or 
socially beneficial products or services. As at 31 December 2017, 
Rathbone Greenbank Investments had £1.1 billion of funds under 
management, equivalent to 2.52% of Rathbone Investment 
Management’s funds under management. The Rathbone Ethical 
Bond Fund had £1.1 billion of funds under management. 
Affiliations 
The firm has the following affiliations and accreditations:  
— CDP (Carbon Disclosure Project) as well as being a signatory to 
the CDP sister programmes on water disclosure and forests 
— UN-backed PRI. We also play an active role in the PRI 
Collaboration Platform. Out of over 1,800 members of this leading 
initiative, Rathbones was named as one of the top 20 most active 
and influential members of the PRI Collaboration Platform in 2015 
and 2016, a significant achievement given our size relative to other 
PRI members. In 2017, we launc hed our stewardship policy and 
moved into the ‘A’ band in the Strategy & Governance module of 
the UN PRI’s annual reporting framework 
— UK Sustainable and Investment Finance Association (UKSIF) 
and the Ecumenical Council for Corporate Responsibility. 
Rathbone Greenbank Investments is also a leading member of 
the Institutional Investors Group on Climate Change (IIGCC) 
Voting 
The cornerstone of all responsible investment is an active and 
considered approach to proxy voting. Since 2010, the group’s 
voting activity has been coordinated by a dedicated committee, 
established in line with Rathbones’ obligations under the PRI, and 
pays heed to the Financial Reporting Council’s (FRC) UK 
Stewardship Code. Composed of investment managers and other 
representatives from across the business, and supported by a 
permanent stewardship director, the committee maintains general 
group policy on corporate governance. Advice and research 
received by the committee supplements the analysis carried  
out internally as part of the investment process. The committee 
issues voting recommendations based on best practice which 
establishes a baseline for consideration by the major holders of the 
companies in question. Our investment managers retain the 
ability to vote independently of this advice if appropriate.  
Rathbone Investment Management exercises the voting rights 
attached to its largest holdings, covering the most widely-held 
stocks across the business. Voti ng is also undertaken on any 
company if requested by an underlying shareholder.  
Rathbone Unit Trust Management, as an institutional investor, 
meets its obligations as a signatory to the Stewardship Code and 
was classified as a Tier 2 signator y by the FRC in 2016. In addition 
to expanding the scope of proxy voting in 2015 and now 
employing ISS to vote actively on all of its holdings, Rathbone Unit 
Trust Management has recently clarified its policy on stewardship 
and company engagement in line with the demand of regulators.  
Votes are entered in line with UK corporate governance best 
practice, overseen by the stewardship director and fund managers 
and investment managers. During 2017, the committee oversaw 
active proxy voting on 5,046 resolutions at 398 company 
meetings. Voting on these resolu tions includes consideration of 
such issues as executive remuneration, auditor independence, 
appointment of directors and non-financial reporting. 
Case study – Smith & Nephe w 
Our major issues with variable pay come when the experience 
of management and shareholders becomes misaligned. It is 
vital that remuneration policies be desi gned in such a way that 
investors can have confidence that exceptional variable pay 
will only come under certain prescribed circumstances, 
meeting performance conditions which are unambi guous and 
easily understood. However, most companies equip their 
remuneration committees with discretion to make awards 
even where performance conditions have not been met. In 
the year in question, the remuneration committee at the 
company exercised discretion to provide for elements of a 
Long Term Incentive Plan to vest despite targets on Total 
Shareholder Return not being met. 
We wrote to the company expressing our concern over the 
use of discretion and the lack of convincing rationale for doing 
so. The performance targets were set by the remuneration 
committee, with full knowledge of the market conditions, and 
we consider it a matter of sound precedent that the company 
should be prepared to accept the outcome of the structure an d 
incentives that it has chosen. Given the company’s relative 
size and standing, we viewed th e use of discretion in such a 
manner to fall short of best practice. 
We are committed to transparency in this area and 
regularly report on our activities via our corporate website. 
A more detailed assessmen t of our votes against 
management can be found in our review of Stewardship 
and Proxy Voting which can be found on our website.

Engagement 
Engagement with companies on ESG matters is largely 
undertaken by Rathbone Greenbank Investments’ ethical research 
team and the stewardship director on behalf of the stewardship 
committee. Engagement may occur as a result of fundamental 
analysis of companies’ ESG reporting or through collaborative 
efforts initiated by interest groups such as CDP, UKSIF or the PRI 
Collaboration Platform. It covers a wide range of themes spanning 
the whole of the environmental, social and governance spectrum. 
In 2017, we joined the steering committee for the PRI-coordinated 
engagement on cyber security. 
Employees 
Our approach 
We are firmly committed to evolving our people policies and 
practices and having continued high levels of employee 
engagement in line with our corp orate values. Our goal continues 
to be the delivery of the highest possible quality of service to our 
clients through talented and professional employees. Rathbones 
has over 1,100 staff in 16 locations in the UK and Jersey. We 
promote a culture where we recrui t and retain individuals whose 
values match those of the business. To promote engagement with 
our values, we actively encourage employees to become involved 
in the financial performance of the group through our all 
employee SIPs (UK Share Incentive Plan and International Share 
Incentive Plan) and SAYE (Save As You Earn share option plan).  
We also encourage our employees to become financially aware 
and offer discounted independent financial advice. We have 
offered share ownership plans to our employees since 1996 and 
now have 55% in our SAYE and 87% in our SIP plans. 
Employee statistics

Learning 
We continue to support the development of all our employees 
and have maintained our average investment per person at a 
significant level of £783 (2016:£6 34) and an average of two days’ 
training per year. These figures are a very conservative estimate 
because there is much more employee development that has no 
direct cost and is conducted at the desk.  
Our aim when delivering high-quality programmes is to ensure 
that employees have the best opportunity to put their learning 
into practice. We do this by engaging with line managers and other 
stakeholders in the business to ensure that the opportunity and 
support is in place for employees to use new skills. We regularly 
implement new initiatives across the group to ensure that all 
employees have access to the de velopment they need for their 
current and possible future roles.

Leadership and management development  
We have developed a comprehensive suite of management and 
leadership courses. These are desi gned to enable the business to 
identify high-potential employees and progress them through key 
stages of learning from being highly effective team members to 
ultimately growing into senior leadership roles. The leadership 
programme continued successfully throughout the year and the 
programme again involved senior managers focusing on how to 
lead their teams to achieve corporate goals. The programme 
culminates in a presentation ab out leadership changes and the 
value of the learning. This format will continue to cascade through 
the firm during 2017 to build leadership and management skills 
across the group. 
We have aligned some of our management development to 
formal qualifications. A number of managers have successfully 
achieved a level 5 qualificat ion awarded by the Chartered 
Management Institute. This included a module on managing 
operational risk which was tailor ed to the specific issues in 
Rathbones. We will continue to support this type of development 
where the formal recognition of learning is appropriate. 
Continuing professional development (CPD) 
Our client-facing employees contin ue to meet and mostly exceed 
the required CPD targets set by our regulators. Investment 
managers have the opportunity to further improve their technical 
and management skills to ensure that the highest levels of client 
service are maintained. 
Talent development  
Rathbones is keen to develop a pipeline of high-calibre talent to 
ensure appropriate skills and succession planning for the future. 
Our third apprenticeship programme is well underway with 11 
participants and, in light of the ongoing success of this programme, 
a further group will be recruited in 2018. Our continued 
commitment to developing younger talent means that the 
existing graduate development programme will be completed in 
March 2018 and a new programme started in September. The 
programme sees the trainees participate in a variety of placements 
around the firm to gain a broad range of experience. 
Career development and performance management 
We have further developed our career frameworks to help 
employees see their future pathway for progression within the 
organisation. There is further work to do in this area and there is a 
commitment to help employees and managers with the skills 
required for career management. A leadership framework has 
been developed that we inte nd to incorporate into our 
management training and promotion processes in 2018. 
The performance management process is reviewed on an ongoing 
basis and, in 2017, we have launched an online performance 
management tool to help us better support both line managers 
and employees. 
Diversity and inclusion 
Rathbones is an equal opportunities employer and it is our policy 
to ensure that all job applicants and employees are treated fairly 
and on merit regardless of race, sex, marital/civil partnership 
status, age, disability, religious belief, pregnancy, maternity, gender 
reassignment or sexual orientation. 
We have two female directors out of seven and have thus 
achieved our commitment to meet Lord Davies’ target of 25% 
female board representation. We are working towards achieving 
the adjusted target of 33% of female board representation for FTSE 
350 companies by 2020 and are deve loping a policy aligned to the 
recommendations published in the Hampton-Alexander review in 
November 2017. 
Historically, women have been less well represented in the 
investment management industry and addressing this imbalance 
is a key priority. We are working hard to bring in more women in 
graduate trainee positions (our graduate and apprenticeship 
programmes currently comprise broadly equal numbers of men 
and women) and by encouraging more applications from women 
to our work experience and fi nancial career programmes.  
We continue to target the progression and development of 
existing female employees with opportunities for leadership and 
management programmes. After engaging with our recently 
returned maternity leavers in 2016, we undertook a 
comprehensive review of our fam ily leave policies. In 2017, we 
implemented significant improvements to our maternity, 
adoption and paternity policies. We also introduced group 
coaching and online support for working parents. 
We have started a training pr ogramme covering diversity, 
inclusion and unconscious bias. Our executive committee were 
amongst the first to participate and are actively supporting the roll-
out to all managers across the firm. 
Rathbones prides itself on being a ‘real Living Wage’ employer and 
pays Living Wage Foundation rates of pay to sub-contractor staff 
and internal employees. 
Modern slavery 
Rathbones is committed to maintaining and improving our 
practices to tackle slavery and human trafficking violations with 
respect to our own operations, our supply chain and our services. 
We welcomed the introduction of the Modern Slavery Act in 2015 
and used this as an opportunity to build on our existing policies 
and develop a focused approach to addressing the risk of modern 
slavery. Rathbones already has a rang e of relevant policies in place 
such as our policy on stewardship, being a living wage employer, 
equal opportunities and whistle bl owing. To further develop our 
approach, we set ourselves a set of objectives over the next three 
years. These include: carrying ou t a third-party risk assessment, 
developing prioritised actions base d on the results, introducing  
a modern slavery screening process, training our staff and 
communicating what we are doing.

Strategic report Corporate responsibility report continued 
48 Rathbone Brothers Plc Report and accounts 2017 
This year we engaged a third-party sustainability consultancy, 
Carbon Smart, to carry out a modern slavery risk assessment of 
our operations and supply chain. This was important to us 
because, although we are a professional services business in a 
highly regulated market and therefore low risk, we do know that 
no supply chain is risk free. Carbon Smart mapped our annual 
supplier spend based on sector an d location to identify areas of 
elevated risk in our su pply chain. The majority of our spend is in 
the UK with a small proportion in the US and Canada and the 
majority is with professional services, which is low risk. However, 
the risk assessment did show that there was an elevated risk, 
although still below the UK average and well below the global 
average in the following sectors:  
— Construction – refurbishment of our buildings  
— Paper – the stationery that we buy 
— Chemicals – cleaning chemicals that we purchase  
With an understanding of our level of risk and the relevant sectors, 
we were able to develop a risk-bas ed approach which allows us to 
focus our attention and resources where it matters the most. In the 
event our staff wish to procure products or services from the 
above sectors, additional checks must be performed. All new 
suppliers in the above categories must share with us their modern 
slavery statements. In addition to this, we have engaged with all 
our current suppliers to understand the due diligence they have in 
place to mitigate the risk of modern slavery in their supply chains. 
This year our focus is on embe dding the due diligence checks.  
Our key staff will receive modern slavery training to ensure that 
they understand how modern slavery may manifest itself and 
what they can do to mitigate the risk when engaging with 
suppliers. To raise awareness, we will also communicate to  
wider staff what we are doing in this space. At the end of the  
year, we also plan to review the due diligence checks we have 
carried out to understand the effe ctiveness of our approach and 
update accordingly. 
Anti-bribery policy 
As a firm we value our reputation for ethical behaviour and 
upholding the utmost integrity and we comply with the Prudential 
Regulation Authority (PRA) and the Financial Conduct Authority 
(FCA) clients’ best interests rule. We understand that in addition to 
the criminality of bribery and corruption, any such crime would 
also have an adverse effect on our reputation and integrity. 
Rathbones has a zero tolerance approach to bribery and 
corruption and we ensure all our employees and suppliers are 
adequately trained as to limit our exposure to bribery by: 
— setting out clear anti-bribery and corruption policies 
— providing mandatory training to all employees 
— encouraging our employees to be vigilant and report  
any suspected cases of bribery in accordance with the 
specified procedures 
— escalating and investigating in stances of suspected bribery  
and assisting the police or othe r appropriate authorities in  
their investigations. 
Gender pay reporting 
The firm will be preparing and submitting its data on gender pay 
to the government and will ensure it’s available on the website 
ahead of the deadline of 4 April 2018. 
Performance and reward 
We offer a comprehensive remuneration package which is 
regularly reviewed to ensure that our employees are fairly 
rewarded. This is supported by challenging objective-setting and 
appraisal processes to align reward to corporate goals and 
motivate and encourage high performance. 
All employees have the opportunity to participate in a pension 
arrangement and are eligible to re ceive at least a 3% contribution 
from the company to a group personal pension arrangement, 
rising to 10% with additional employee contributions. In 2017, we 
concluded a consultation with members of the company defined 
benefit pension scheme and this resulted in closure of the 
Rathbones 1987 defined benefit pension scheme to future accrual 
in June 2017. Going forward, we have provided members of this 
scheme with access to the same pens ion benefits provided to all of 
our other employees.  
We provide a wide range of core benefits such as private medical 
cover, income protection insurance and life assurance. All 
employees are eligible for an annual medical examination funded 
by the company. 
  
48 Rathbone Brothers Plc Report and accounts 2017 rathbones.com  49  
Employees are encouraged to identify with and benefit from the 
financial performance of the group through share-matching 
within the SIP, free shares and SAYE schemes. 
We have a continued focus on employee wellbeing. Employees 
have access to an employee assist ance programme (EAP) offering 
confidential advice and support to them and their families. We 
have rolled out a number of training and drop-in sessions on 
wellbeing-related topics. 
Our people can also take advantage of the vast range of  
voluntary benefits available such as the cycle to work scheme, 
childcare vouchers, flexible holidays, voluntary leave and 
discounts on products and services through our ‘Reward Board’  
benefits platform. 
Employee relations 
Engagement with our employees is crucial to the continuing 
success of the group. We communicate regularly and openly with 
them on matters affecting them and on the issues that have an 
impact on the performance of the group and actively seek their 
feedback on these matters. After the success of the engagement 
survey run in 2016, we will be running a second employee survey 
in 2018 in order to asse ss employee engagement.  
Rathbones recognises the importance of an appropriate work-life 
balance, both to the health and welfare of employees and to the 
business. Holiday entitlement begins at 25 days per annum for all 
employees, increasing to 30 days after five years’ service, with the 
opportunity to buy up to five additional days of flexible leave  
each year. 
Communities 
Donations and fundraising 
During the year, the group made total charitable donations of 
£378,000, representing 0.70% of group pre-tax profits  
(2016: £353,000, representing 0.6% of group pre-tax profits). It  
also included the matching of employee donations made through 
the tax efficient Give As You Earn (GAYE) payroll giving scheme. 
In 2017, Rathbones’ employees made payments totalling £225,000 
(2016: £196,000) through this scheme, which is administered by 
the Charities Aid Foundation. The company matched staff 
donations of up to £200 per month made through GAYE and,  
in 2017, donated £161,000 (2016: £164,000) to causes chosen by 
employees through this method. 
During 2017, the Rathbone Brothers Foundations across the 
country considered many requests for assistance and met a 
number of charities. Significant donations were made to and 
volunteering activities organised for the following organisations: 
— The Rathbones Winchester office staff chose to do their annual 
volunteering week at Shepherd’s Down school. The team 
helped improve the outdoor envi ronment of the school that 
provides care and education to children with special needs 
— Enabling Enterprise is an award-winning not-for-profit social 
enterprise, set up by a team of teachers in 2009. Their mission 
is to equip young people with the skills, experiences and 
aspirations they need to succeed in life. The Liverpool team 
hosted children from Blessed Sacrament Primary School. 
Guided by Rathbones employees, the children took part in a 
fun activity where they played the role of stock market traders 
who had to evaluate potential investments and make 
decisions on behalf of their clients. The London office hosted 
children from years four and six of Holly Park Primary School 
and St Francis de Sales. The same challenge applied and gave 
the kids a great opportunity to use their imaginations, work in 
teams and give a presentati on at the end of the day 
— Clearvision is a lending library that adds Braille to children’s 
books, before loaning them to visually impaired children.  
The charity’s library is well established and serves over 1,000 
families, schools, Vision Support Services and public libraries. 
The London Rathbone Brothers Foundation has donated 
money for the past three years  
— The Teapot Trust is a children’s charity which uses art therapy 
as a way of helping young people cope with long-term medical 
conditions. The Edinburgh office supported the charity 
through its annual in-house art exhibition. Over 200 Rathbones 
guests attended the exhibition, which was held across two 
evenings in November, showcasing local artists  
— The Cambridge office supports two local charities: the 
Cambridge Central Aid Society, which offers rapid financial 
help to individuals and families in Cambridge who are in need; 
and the Connections Bus Project, a charity providing youth 
work services across Cambridgeshire, delivering youth clubs, 
training courses and consultations and support for smaller 
community youth projects.  
Investing in brighter futures  
The FIL Rathbones Women’s Lacrosse World Cup was the largest 
women’s international sporting event in the UK in 2017. As lead 
sponsor of the tournament, Rathbones put on and supported 
many activities throughout the year to highlight the importance, 
and encourage the advancemen t, of women’s sport.  
Rathbones has been a strong suppor ter of lacrosse in the UK since 
2011 through our partnerships with English Lacrosse and Lacrosse 
Scotland. Our focus for these programmes has been on 
encouraging girls to play sport, as we acknowledge the value of 
sport in the lives of young people in teaching key life skills.  
The Rathbones Financial Awareness programme is another 
significant element of our investment in young people. 
Investment managers deliver presentations to 16–25-year-olds 
within our offices and at schools around the UK. The programme 
aims to equip those attending with the necessary information to 
take ownership of their finances at a young age. In 2017, the 
programme was delivered to nearly 2,000 young people.

Rathbones also supports the arts through the Rathbones Folio 
programme. The pinnacle of the programme is the Rathbones 
Folio Prize, a prize awarded to the best English language book 
across all genres. However, just as important are the other parts of 
the programme, which include the Rathbones Folio Mentorship 
for aspiring young writers and the Rathbones Folio Sessions, 
which encourage thought and stimulate debate at literary festivals 
throughout the country. 
Environmental impact 
This year marks the tenth year in which Rathbones has reported 
its carbon footprint. As a respon sible investor, Rathbones leads by 
example in our approach to environmental matters, striving to 
understand the environmental impacts of our business activities 
and, wherever possible, act to reduce them. In 2017, we enhanced 
our environmental monitoring and reporting process, thereby 
improving our performance management capabilities. Key 
benefits of the revised approach include the alignment of our 
carbon footprint reporting with Rathbones’ financial year
1
 and an 
improved ability to assess and influence environmental 
performance throughout the year.  
Our 2017 carbon footprint 
We are pleased to report a 9% reduction in our overall emissions  
to 2,553 tCO2e, down from 2,798 tCO2e in 2016. Furthermore,  
our emissions intensity has also reduced by over 20% following 
continued growth in both headco unt and funds under management. 
These reductions are primarily at tributable to reduced energy 
consumption across our offices, reduced emissions from flights, 
paper and waste, and the continued decarbonisation of the UK’s 
electricity supply. Notably, our new head office building in 
Finsbury Circus has proved significantly less energy intensive 
than our previous Curz on Street location. 
Building energy emissions arising from energy consumption at 
our offices and data centres were 1,484 tCO 2e in 2017, down 14% 
from 1,730 tCO 2e in 2016. 
Business travel emissions increased to 716 tCO 2e, up 2% from 699 
tCO2e last year, despite a reported 7% reduction in emissions from 
flights. Our travel emissions rose largely due to a 17% increase in 
headcount and increased use of employee-owned cars for 
business purposes. 
Emissions from other resources , namely paper, waste and 
refrigerants, were 353 tCO 2e, down 4% from 369 tCO 2e in 2016, 
following reductions in paper and waste emissions.

Key achievements in 2017 
Rathbones completed several important initiatives in 2017 to mark the tenth anniversary of our reporting on environmental impac ts. 
Our new head office 
In February 2017, we completed our move to 8 Finsbury Circus, a building which has achieved a Building Research Establishment 
Environmental Assessment Method (BREEAM) ‘Excellent’ rating in recognition of its performance and facilities across a range of 
environmental criteria. Although our new head office provides over 50% more fl oor area, it used 20% less energy in 2017 than Cu rzon 
Street in the previous year. Fu rthermore, it enables Rathbones to reduce enviro nmental impacts through the provision of 160 cyc le spaces, 
photovoltaics, and a green roof grey water recycling system. 
Improved performance management and reporting  
Having reported Rathbones’ environmental impacts on an annual basis over the last 10 years, in 2017 we increased the focus and 
frequency of this process to provide quarterly performance updates, analysis and trending information throughout the year.  
This has delivered the following key benefits to management: 
— More timely provision of environment data, enabling the alignmen t of carbon footprint reporting with Rathbones’ financial year 
— Improved data quality and accuracy, reducing the number of estimations required due to unavailable or incomplete data 
— Intra-year visibility of environmental performance, thereby creating capacity for the management team to identify actions durin g the 
year that will influence year-end performance. 
Compliance with regulations 
Rathbones complies with the regulations for reporting greenhouse gas emissions. Following an operational control approach to de fining 
our organisational boundary, our 2017 greenhouse gas emissions from business activities amounted to:  
— 321 tCO 2e resulting from the combustion of fuel and the operation of any facilities (classified as Scope 1 in this report) 
— 851 tCO 2e from the purchase of elec tricity by the company for its own use (classified as Scope 2 in this report).  
In February 2017, we moved to our new head office location in Finsbury Circus, which increased our reporting boundary. It was n ot 
possible to obtain consumption data during the fit-out period in 2016 and so these emissions were excluded from last year’s report. This 
data has now been obtained and included within our rebaselining of 2016 data. It has not been practical to gather data on energy use at our 
Lymington office and we have used typical energy consumption benchmarks to calculate the energy use at this site based on floor area.  
The methodology used is in accordance with the requirements of the fo llowing standard: The World Re sources Institute Greenhouse Gas 
Protocol (revised version). This includes best practice Scope 2 guidance using the ma rket-based method: ‘Environmental Reportin g 
Guidelines: including mandatory greenhouse gas emissions reporting guidance’ (Defra, October 2013) and ISO 14064 – part 1.

Rebaselining 
Rathbones’ reporting period for greenhouse gas emissions is now 1 January to 31 December, aligned to our financial year. The re porting 
period was previously offset by three months to allow additional time for data collation. To ensure comparability of 2017 perfo rmance 
against previous years, we have rebaselined emissions back to 2013. Variations in seasonal co nsumption and emissions factors pr oduced 
several minor variations as detailed below.

Carbon Smart opinion statement 
This statement provides Rathbones and its stakeholders with a third-party assessment of the quality and reliability of Rathbone s’ carbon 
footprint data for the reporting period 1 January 2017 to 31 De cember 2017. It does not represent an independent third-party as surance of 
Rathbones’ management approach to sustainability.  
Carbon Smart has been commissioned by Rathbones for the tenth co nsecutive year to calculate Rathbones’ carbon footprint for all offices 
for its 2017 annual report. Through this engagement, Carbon Smart has assured Rathbones that the reported carbon footprint is 
representative of the business and that the data presented is credible and compliant with the appropriate standards and industr y practices. 
Data has been collected and calculated foll owing the ISO 14064 – part 1 standard and verified against the WRI GHG Protocol prin ciples of 
completeness, consistency and accuracy. Carbon Smart’s work has included interviews with key Rathbones personnel, a review of i nternal 
and external documentation, interrogation of source data and data collection systems, including comparison with the previous ye ars’ data. 
Carbon Smart has concluded the points listed below. 
Relevance 
We have ensured the GHG inventory appropriately reflects the GHG emissions of the company and serves the decision-making needs of 
users, both internal and external to the company. 
Completeness 
Rathbones continues to use the operational control approach to define its organisational boundary. Rathbones calculates total direct 
Scope 1, 2 and major Scope 3 emissions. Reported environmental data covers all employees and all entities that meet the criteri a of being 
subject to control or significant influence of the reporting organisation.  
Consistency  
To ensure comparability, we have used the same calculation methodologies and assumptions as for the previous year. In 2017, pre vious 
years’ emissions have been rebaselined to align with Rathbones’ financial year. 
Transparency  
Where relevant, we have included appropriate references to the accounting and calculation methodologies, assumptions and 
recalculations performed. 
Accuracy 
To our knowledge, data is considered accurate within the limits of the quality and completeness of the data provided.

CSR strategy review 
During 2017, Rathbones undertook an in-depth review of CSR with the aim of developing a framework for promoting sustainability across 
the business and ensuring good corporate citizenship. Through consultation with key stakeholders, we considered material sustai nability 
issues alongside key drivers for our business. This review was an important first step towards the definition of a longer-term roadmap to 
sustainability and identified the following four ‘pillars’ as most relevant to our business. 
Employees 
Rathbones began life as a family business. Many of our employees are also shareholders and the success of our business is intri nsically 
linked to our people. We recognise that ev ery person around the world deserves to be treated with dignity and equality and our 
responsibility to respect the human rights of our direct employees and those within our supply chain. 
Governance and stewardship 
At Rathbones, we believe in the importance of adopting best practice corporate governance standards and managing companies and 
investments in the long-term interests of shareholders. As with good governance and responsible stewardship, sustainability, at its heart,  
is about promoting long-term success. 
Environment 
For the last 10 years, Rathbones has reported its environmental impacts and acted to reduce them. No w more than ever, we recogn ise the 
importance of tackling environmental issues and that every business, regardless of sect or, must act to reduce its ecological footprint. 
Social and community 
Rathbones is part of an increasingly interconnected global commun ity. We recognise the importance of acting to promote wellbein g and 
maximise the positive impacts of our business in the societies and communities within which we operate. By promoting the succes s of 
those around us, we can help to generate the co nditions for sustainable growth in our business.

Strategic report Corporate responsibility report continued 
52 Rathbone Brothers Plc Report and accounts 2017 
Looking forward 
Rathbones’ continued action on CSR is driven by the following co nsiderations. Firstly, it is our longstanding and collective de sire to be a 
good corporate citizen. We recognise that acting on sustainability issues is the right thing to do. Over the next 10 years, we fully expect the 
importance of acting sustainably to increa se for our business and its stakeholders – the clients we serve, our employees, the local and 
global communities within which we operate and our suppliers and delivery partners. 
Secondly, we recognise this increasing focus on sustainability issues as one of several leading trends that will impact and def ine businesses 
in every sector the over the coming years. Already we see a growth in related regulation and the need for transparency on socia l and 
environmental issues. The advent of millenni als as employees and customers of our busi ness will serve to accelerate interest bo th in 
acting responsibly as a business and in responsible investme nt opportunities. 
For these reasons, Rathbones will continue to increase its focus on sustainability issues. In 2018, we will further develop our programme of 
action across the four pillars identified above and, by 2020, we will produce a dedicated, standalone report on our CSR perform ance.

Governance Corporate governance report 
58 Rathbone Brothers Plc Report and accounts 2017 
 
I am pleased to introduce the co rporate governance report for 
2017, which includes commenta ries from me and the other 
committee chairmen. The report explains how we applied the 
principles of good governance including the provisions of the 2016 
edition of the Financial Reporting Council’s (FRC) UK Corporate 
Governance Code (‘the Code’)
1
.  
The board recognises and champions the benefits of good 
governance across the firm. We understand that a good 
governance framework creates a solid foundation which  
enables us to act in the best interests of our clients, shareholders 
and other stakeholders.  
Culture 
The board places great importance on the firm’s culture which has 
developed over many years and represents a key competitive 
advantage. The firm’s client focus and integrity is fundamental to 
achieving the best results for clients and shareholders over the 
long term.  
In order to assess the firm’s culture, a fundamental review was 
conducted in 2016 and the findings were discussed at length by 
the board and executive committee. A number of metrics were 
agreed, with ongoing monitoring by the conduct risk committee 
and quarterly board updates. In addition, a cu lture dashboard 
relating to clients, colleagues and other stakeholders has been 
developed which enables the group risk committee and the board 
to review and monitor key metrics. To provide helpful colour to 
this data, an additional paper is prepared giving illustrative 
examples of good and poor conduc t in the firm. My non-executive 
director colleagues and I have also continued during the year to 
assess the firm’s culture through direct engagement, both formal 
and informal, with in vestment managers and other employees 
throughout the business.  
The biggest challenges to our cult ure include the increase in the 
size of our business and the plethora of new regulation. This brings 
with it the need for greater formalities in processes and for more 
detailed data on clients and their changing circumstances .  
Board and executive succession 
After a rigorous recruitment proce ss, we were delighted to welcome 
Jim Pettigrew to the board in March 2017. A comprehensive and 
tailored induction programme was arranged for Jim to introduce 
him to the business and provide industry context. Additional 
detail of the induction programme is provided later in the report. 
Jim was appointed senior indepe ndent director in May 2017 
following the retirement of David Harrel. 
The board recognises the importance of planning for the future 
and ensuring that succession pl ans are in place and embedded 
throughout the firm. Kathryn Matthews is due to stand down by 
the end of 2018, having served nine years as a director. We have 
engaged independent search consultants to find someone with 
the experience and skills to repl ace Kathryn as chairman of the 
group risk committee. Following a skills audit, which was initiated 
by the nomination committee and presented to the board, 
consideration is being given to recruiting an additional non-
executive director with the aim of bringing new skills to the board, 
taking account of the existing ba lance of knowledge, experience 
and diversity. 
In addition, the board has discussed and approved the 
recommendations from the nomination committee to strengthen 
and formalise executive succession planning and talent 
management processes throughout the firm.

Board meetings 
During the year, the board held seven scheduled meetings and 
met formally and informally on many occasions. Prior to each 
scheduled board meeting, I meet with the non-executive directors 
to discuss any significant matters arising from the board papers 
and the focus of any challenges. We receive written reports on the 
development of the business and key performance indicators, 
together with detailed updates on the progress of agreed strategic 
initiatives. Each board meeting is attended for relevant items by 
members of the executive committee so that we can discuss their 
respective areas of responsibility in depth.  
In between board meetings, I main tain frequent contact with the 
executive team and, in particular, the chief executive who keeps 
me apprised of progress and key developments. Philip and I also 
discuss how to bring issues to th e board in the most effective  
way. Our senior independent direct or, Jim Pettigrew, and I are in 
frequent contact and I often discuss with him my thinking on 
significant board issues. Jim and I are also in regular dialogue with 
our other non-executive colleagues to ensure that any areas of 
concern are aired. 
Board effectiveness 
As it had been three years since our last external board evaluation, 
Independent Audit were appointed during 2017 to conduct a 
review of the board. Their report provided a helpful analysis of the 
board’s strengths and weaknesses and overall was both positive 
and constructive. Further details can be found later in the report.  
Remuneration policy  
We are due to present our remuneration policy for approval at the 
2018 annual general meeting (AGM ), as it has been three years 
since our policy was last approved in 2015. The remuneration 
committee has assessed our policy in the context of a changing 
external environment and the firm’s own requirements. While 
maintaining the principal features of our existing policy, a number 
of small changes have been proposed to align the interests of 
executives and investors more closely. The chairman of the 
remuneration committee, Sarah Gentleman, carried out an 
extensive consultation exercise with our largest shareholders 
before finalising the new policy. Further details about the changes 
to our policy can be found in the remuneration report on page 80.  
Looking forward 
The nomination committee continues to take into consideration 
the recommendations of the Davies report and the McGregor-
Smith initial review on board diversity. Currently, our two female 
directors represent 29% of the total board membership. As a board, 
we acknowledge the importance of board diversity and, looking 
forward, regard will be given to female representation targets 
during the recruitment process. The firm will ensure that there are 
no barriers to women succeeding at the highest levels.

The role of the board 
The board provides the leaders hip and oversight to ensure  
long-term success for the company and its stakeholders.  
To achieve this goal, the board requires a diverse and talented 
membership with a range of skills and experience and the ability 
to challenge and support the executive management. The board 
has a strong non-executive team which currently comprises 
former executives with financial, risk management and 
operational experience drawn from a variety of financial 
institutions. In addition, the broad experience of the non-executive 
directors allows them to understand the challenges and 
opportunities that face the firm and enables them to contribute  
to discussions and decisions.  
Board meetings  
Most scheduled board meetings are preceded by a board dinner, 
which allows for broader discussions on particular topics. The 
board dinners also provide an opportunity for the board to meet 
members of the management team or to receive training. In 
months where no formal board meeting is scheduled, an informal 
meeting of the non-executive directors, the chairman and the 
chief executive is generally held. The non-executive directors also 
have informal meetings without the chairman or chief executive 
present. The roles of the chairman, the chief executive, the senior 
independent director and the non- executive directors have been 
clearly defined and agreed by the board to ensure a separation of 
power and authority.  
At every board meeting, the chief executive updates the board on 
the implementation of strategy and recent developments. The 
finance director reviews the financial performance and forecasts 
against plan and market expectations. The chief risk officer 
updates the board on key risk areas and any emerging regulatory 
issues which impact the busine ss. The board is updated on 
shareholder sentiment and sign ificant changes in the share 
register. In addition, members of the executive committee attend 
meetings as required to presen t and discuss progress in their 
individual businesses and functions. 
Specific areas of focus and major decisions taken by the board 
during the year in line with its ‘matters reserved’ mandate are 
listed below. 
— Reviewed and assessed st rategic initiatives  
— Scrutinised the benefits of, and monitored progress on,  
the proposed merger with Smith & Williamson 
— Approved the firm’s risk framework and appetite 
— Reviewed the firm’s risk management and internal  
controls systems 
— Oversaw financial performance against plan and market 
expectations 
— Focused on management’s delivery of organic growth 
initiatives 
— Assessed and approved the firm’s capital adequacy annual 
budget 
— Monitored and assessed the firm’s culture 
— Approved interim and full year financial statements, interim 
dividend and recommended final dividend 
— Approved the firm’s viability statement and going concern 
disclosure for the year ended 31 December 2016 
— Approved the 2016 report and accounts to shareholders 
against the fair, balanced and understandable criteria. 
Operations of the board 
The board has a rolling agenda which ensures that key matters are 
addressed. The board held seven scheduled meetings during the 
year, a strategy day and had a num ber of additional formal and 
informal meetings. The board also appointed a committee to 
ensure close non-executive di rector involvement in the 
discussions with Smith & Williamson. The chairman and the 
company secretary manage board and committee meetings and 
ensure that the board (and particularly the non-executive 
directors) receive appropriate and balanced information. The 
company secretary manages the timely circulation of information 
to the board. All board papers ar e prepared by executives and 
clearly indicate the action required. As part of the annual board 
evaluation process, board members provided input into the level 
and quality of the information that is provided. In addition, the 
company secretary ensures board procedures are complied with 
and applicable rules are followed. 
The company secretary facilitates the induction process for new 
directors, assists with their professional development and advises 
the board on corporate governance matters and on the rules and 
regulations that affect a UK-listed company. The appointment or 
removal of the company secretary is a matter for the board.

Independence 
The board, on the recommendation of the nomination committee, 
considers that all of the non-exec utive directors are independent. 
All board members are required to disclose any external positions 
or interests which may conflict with their directorship of 
Rathbones prior to their appointment so that any potential conflict 
can be properly assessed. The board has regard to the fact the 
experienced non-executive directors in financial firms are a 
valuable resource and may sit on several boards. Conflicts of 
interest can generally be mana ged by due proc ess and common 
sense. In this regard, the board carefully analysed the regulatory 
and governance risks attached to the appointment of Jim 
Pettigrew since he is chairman of Miton Group. After consulting 
with Jim, and asse ssing his time comm itments, the board 
approved the appointment, but put in place procedures and 
requirements, which need to be observed by Jim. The board  
also considered carefully the risks attached to the proposed 
appointment of Kathryn Matthews to the board of Barclays Bank 
UK Plc. After consulting with Kathryn, and assessing her time 
commitments, the board approved the appointment, but put in 
place procedures and requirements, which Kathryn must observe. 
Board induction 
Our non-executive directors are offered a comprehensive and 
tailored induction programme to introduce them to the business, 
industry and regulatory context. The programme is based on one-
to-one meetings with the executive directors and executive 
committee members, the heads of group functions and the 
company secretary and covers the areas of business outlined

Board development 
The firm is committed to the training and development of all staff 
to ensure professional standards are maintained and enhanced. All 
directors are encouraged to update their skills and any training 
needs are assessed as part of the board evaluation process. Their 
knowledge and the non-executive directors’ familiarity with the 
firm is facilitated by access to senior management and visits to 
teams in London and offices across the country. The company 
secretary assists with profession al development requirements of 
the board. In addition, the boa rd receives mandatory annual 
training on the following areas:  
— CASS 
— SEC obligations 
— ICAAP and ILAAP 
During the year, the board received presentations on the impact  
of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and MiFID II 
(Markets in Financial Instruments Directive) on the firm, including 
the associated change programmes that will be involved. Finally, 
committee members also receive regular updates on technical 
developments at scheduled meetings.  
Governance of the company 
In relation to compliance with the Code, this report, together  
with the directors’ report, states the position at 21 February 2018. 
The Code was updated in April 2016 by the FRC and applies to the 
company’s 2017 financial year. The directors have considered the 
contents and recommendations of the Code and confirm that 
throughout the year the company has applied the main principles 
and complied with the provisions of the Code.  
Board diversity policy 
Diversity, including professional and ethnic diversity, is a key 
factor when assessing the board’s composition. It ensures there is 
the correct balance of skills, ex perience and expertise amongst 
non-executive directors to lead decision-making and assess the 
performance and strategy of the company. 
The board has adopted a board diversity policy to ensure transparency 
and diversity in making appointments to the board on the 
recommendation of the nomination committee. This policy expresses 
our commitment to the principle of non-discrimination and to the 
promotion of fair participation and equality of opportunity for all.  
The gender balance of the board is also taken into consideration 
when recruiting a new non-executive director. This is reflected by 
the current composition of the board.

66 Rathbone Brothers Plc Report and accounts 2017 
Board and board committee evaluation 
The board’s effectiveness, composition and operation are 
reviewed and assessed on an annual basis. Every three years, the 
evaluation is undertaken externally. Accordingly, in 2017, 
Independent Audit Limited were selected to evaluate the board. 
Independent Audit have no connection to the firm.  
This evaluation involved observ ing a board meet ing, reviewing 
board papers and conducting interviews with all board members, 
members of the executive committee who attend board meetings 
and the company secretary. The review covered a number of 
topics, including succession planning, board operations and 
dynamics, governance and compos ition. The evaluation also 
looked at the board committees and how they operated.  
The review concluded that all directors enjoy serving on the board 
and are proud to be associated with Rathbones. The review 
identified a number of strengths but also areas for further 
improvement. All the interviewees described the very high degree 
of integrity shared by all directors, matched by a strong 
commitment to Rathbones and a universal desire to see it flourish. 
The key themes identified in the report were as follows. 
Strengths of the board  
— Board dynamics: the board is not only functioning well but also 
has the capacity and will to improve. Interactions have a 
balance between efficiency and amicability, although there is 
still a need to work on buildin g a more collegiate atmosphere 
and sense of common purpose 
— Risk control: there have been significant improvements in this 
area in recent years. It was widely felt that risks are correctly 
identified and that mechanisms for controlling and mitigating 
them are effective 
— Internal audit: praise for the way audit issues are managed at 
board level 
— Board committees: the board committees were found to be 
operating effectively and were we ll run. There was timely and 
effective reporting to the board 
 Areas for improvement  
— Communication: communication from top management could 
be improved. This is an area where relatively minor changes 
could deliver significant improvement 
— Succession planning: the board should have clearer timelines 
generally and greater visibility of the executive succession 
planning process, including increasing the non-executive 
exposure to senior management below executive  
committee level 
— Board diversity: a need to revi ew the composition of the board 
to ensure that diversity in its br oadest sense (age, outlook, skills 
and ethnicity) is considered 
Overall, the conclusion from th e board evaluation and appraisal 
process was positive, with all directors contributing actively to the 
effective performance of the board and the board committees of 
which he or she is a member. Th e new non-executive director had 
settled in well and felt he had received a comprehensive and 
useful induction. The review confirmed the strengths that had 
been identified in 2014 and identi fied a number of areas of focus 
for further improvement. The board is committed to making 
improvements in these areas.  
In addition to the board evaluation process, the senior 
independent director led a separate performance review in 
respect of the chairman, which involved a review with the  
non-executive directors, excluding the chairman, and a separate 
consultation with the chief executive. The senior independent 
director subsequently provided feedback to the chairman on  
his appraisal, which confirmed his effectiveness.  
Succession planning  
The nomination committee is responsible for both executive and 
non-executive director succession planning and recommends 
new appointments to the board. When making board 
appointments, the board seeks to ensure that there is a diverse 
range of skills, backgrounds and experience, including relevant 
industry experience. Further information is included in the 
nomination committee report.  
Board committees 
Details of the work of the principal board committees are set out in 
the separate reports for each comm ittee, which follow this report. 
Accountability 
The statement of directors’ responsibility for preparing the annual 
report and accounts is set out at the end of this governance 
section. Within this, the director s have included a statement that 
the annual report and accounts present a fair, balanced and 
understandable assessment of the gr oup’s position and prospects. 
To help the board discharge its responsibilities in this area, the 
board consulted the audit committee, which advised on the key 
considerations to comply with best practice and the Code’s 
requirements. Following the committee’s advice, the board 
considered and concluded that: 
— the business model and strate gy were clearly described 
— the assessment of performance was balanced 
— the language used was concise, with good linkages to different 
parts of the document 
— an appropriate forward-looking orientation had been adopted. 
The directors’ report on viability and the going concern basis of 
accounting, which the directors have determined to be 
appropriate, can be found in the strategic report, which also 
describes the group’s perf ormance during the year.

Risk management  
In accordance with the Code, the board is required to monitor the 
firm’s risk management and internal controls systems on an 
ongoing basis. They carry out a re view of their effectiveness and 
report on this review to shareholders. Details of the company’s 
ongoing process for identifying, assessing and managing the 
principal risks faced by the firm are contained in the risk 
management section on pages 21 to 27, together with details of 
those principal risks and their relate d mitigating factors. Whilst the 
board retains overall responsibility for the firm’s risk management 
and internal controls systems, it has delegated oversight to the 
audit and risk committees.  
The group’s financial controls fr amework is designed to provide 
assurance that proper accoun ting records are adequately 
maintained and that financial information used with in the business 
and for external publication is reliable and free from material 
misstatement, thereby safeguarding the company’s assets.  
The board receives regular reports from the chairman of the risk 
committee and chief risk officer on the key risks facing the firm 
that may impact on operational and financial objectives. This 
assessment is completed together with assurance that the level  
of risk retained is consistent with and is being managed in 
accordance with the board’s risk appetite. These reports include 
current and forward-looking assessments of capital and liquidity 
adequacy and a summary ‘risk dashboard’ is presented.  
Also, during the year, the board reviewed and approved the 
operational risk assessment process for the 2017 ICAAP document, 
which includes a capital assessment of financial, conduct and 
operational risks. 
The board assesses the effectiveness of the firm’s internal controls 
on an annual basis an d a report is provided for consideration.  
The report is considered one element of the overall assurance 
processes, and other references for board consideration include 
reports emanating from first line of defence and second line of 
defence assurance teams, including group compliance, anti-
money laundering (AML), as well as the investment risk team and 
information security. 
A one-year risk-based approach drives internal audit coverage and, 
over the course of the year, review work by the function covers all 
material controls across the firm including, compliance, operations 
and financial. The observations arising from this work form the 
basis for the annual internal audit opinion. 
Following these reviews, the board concluded that the firm’s  
risk management processes were effective and there were  
no significant weaknesses or fa ilings in the system of  
internal controls.  
Relations with shareholders  
The board is committed to proactive and constructive 
engagement with the firm’s investors and is keen to develop its 
understanding of shareholder views.  
Effective communication with investors and analysts regarding 
the firm’s strategy and performance is held through regular 
meetings and roadshows by th e chief executive and finance 
director. The board receives and discusses shareholder and 
analyst feedback at each boar d meeting. The chairman and  
non-executive directors are also available to meet with investors  
at the AGM.  
Investor relations activity in 2017 included the following: 
— 2016 year-end results: UK in vestor roadshow and analyst 
presentations 
— Q1 trading update: analyst call 
— Annual general meeting: all directors available for questions 
— 2017 interim results: UK investor roadshow and analyst 
presentations. 
On the initiative of the chairman of the remuneration committee, 
shareholder consultation letters were issued to our 15 largest 
shareholders on our proposed new remuneration policy and 
meetings held with those interested to discuss the proposed 
changes. We will also continue to engage with ISS (Institutional 
Shareholder Services) and the Institutional Voting Information 
Service (IVIS) of the Investment Association and Pensions & 
Investment Research Consultants Ltd (PIRC) before the AGM.  
During 2017, the key areas which the chief executive and finance 
director have discussed wi th investors included:  
— progress on strategic initiatives  
— the proposed merger with Smith & Williamson 
— industry trends including consolidation and the increased use 
of technology  
— upcoming changes to regulation including MiFID II, the FCA 
Asset Management Review and GDPR  
— the closure of our defined benefit pension schemes  
— the London office move to Finsbury Circus and progress on 
the letting of our Curzon Street premises. 
Shareholder meetings 
We welcome shareholders to our AGM in May each year. At every 
AGM, our shareholders are given an overview of the progress of 
the business and outlook for the year. This is followed by the 
opportunity for shareholders to ask questions about the 
resolutions before the meeting and about the business more 
generally. We look forward to meeting shareholders and providing 
a further business update at our 2018 AGM in May this year.

Full terms of reference for the committee are reviewed

Group risk committee chairman’s  
annual statement 
The group risk committee plays a vital part in helping support the 
firm’s governance structure and the ongoing monitoring of the 
firm’s risk management framework. 
During the year, the economic challenges and heavy regulatory 
agenda, coupled with firm-specific risks, have kept the committee 
fully occupied. There have been ongoing enhancements to our risk 
management and risk appetite frameworks and we are satisfied that 
we have the skills and talent across the group to meet the challenges 
and opportunities that lie ahead.  
The committee apportions its time between the planned periodic 
review of key risks and the close scrutiny of topical business risks 
as they develop. This approach allows us to ensure that emerging 
risks can be identified and debated. Details of management risk 
mitigation plans are well understood and appropriate resource is 
provided. The committee saw furt her improvement in the quality 
of the management information that it receives.  
During the year, I met with the Prudential Regulatory Authority 
(PRA) to keep them apprised of our key risks and mitigating 
factors and the impact of the regulatory agenda on the firm.  
Committee meetings  
Our current members are the independent non-executive 
directors, who met on four occasi ons in 2017 (2016: four). Jim 
Pettigrew was appointed to the committee following David 
Harrel’s retirement as a director in May 2017. 
In addition to the members of the committee, standing invitations 
are extended to the chairman, th e executive directors, the chief 
risk officer and the head of internal audit. All attend committee 
meetings as a matter of course and inform the committee’s 
discussions. Other executive committee members and risk team 
members are invited to attend the committee from time-to-time 
as required to present and advise on reports commissioned.  
I regularly meet with the chief risk officer and her risk team in a 
combination of formal and informal sessions an d with senior 
management across all divisions of the group to discuss the 
business environment and to gather their views of emerging risks. 
The committee has an agreed annual standing agenda to cover 
key risk events in the year and are required to be addressed in 
accordance with the terms of refe rence. Prior to each meeting, I 
agree the agenda with the chief risk officer and the company 
secretary to identify key issues impacting on the firm that may 
require the committee’s attention.  
At each meeting, the committee reviews and considers the risk 
and compliance dashboards, which highlight changes in key risks 
impacting on the firm. These dashboards are designed to enable 
the committee to monitor and focus on ongoing or emerging risks. 
In addition, the committee receiv es reports and presentations on 
compliance and anti-money laundering matters, including any 
regulatory changes impacting on the firm.

Finally, the committee conducted ‘d eep dive’ reviews on key risks 
such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), internal 
investment processes and the Internal Liquidity Adequacy 
Assessment Process (ILAAP).  
Committee effectiveness 
A formal and rigorous evaluation of the committee’s effectiveness 
was undertaken during the year as part of the external board 
effectiveness review. The review found that the committee 
operated well and ensured that the firm’s risks were sufficiently 
analysed during the year.  
In addition, the committee is satisfied that it has access to 
sufficient resource to enable it to carry out its duties and continue 
to perform effectively.  
Committee activity in 2017 
Further enhancements were made to the group’s risk management 
framework in 2017, including the co ntinued evolution of the ‘three 
lines of defence’ model to ensure that it remains aligned to industry 
and regulatory standards. The co mmittee also reviewed the risk 
assessment on the firm’s vari ous strategic initiatives.  
A number of areas of operational risk were stressed as part of  
the annual ICAAP. Following robust debate and challenge, the 
committee and board were satisfie d that the group’s business 
model and allocated risk appetite remained appropriate. This is an 
important outcome given the number of change management 
programmes underway across the group, and in our regular 
meetings there is specific focus on the progress of key projects  
and initiatives.  
The list below summarises the key issues that the committee 
considered at each of its meetings during the year in addition to 
standing reports from each control function.

Looking ahead to 2018 
In reviewing the committee’s pr iorities for the coming year, 
consideration will be given to the following areas:  
— Preparation and continued risk assessment of recent and 
upcoming regulatory changes such as GDPR 
— Effective risk management framework for external and internal 
emerging risks 
— Continued assessment of the firm’s risk culture against its  
core values 
— Risk assessment on the impact of technology, Know Your 
Client (KYC) and suitability requirements. 
We are committed to the continuing development of our 
approach to risk management across the three lines of defence.  
In the first line, we expect to se e delivery of a number of projects 
currently underway that should strengthen further the 
sustainability of good client outcomes. We have recently agreed 
several additional resources, which will be used to strengthen the 
second line teams in anticipati on of the likely demands arising 
from the current change agenda. 
We also see further convergence between culture, risk and 
compensation as the risk culture approach in the firm is 
developed and revised compensati on schemes are implemented. 
The group risk committee and remuneration committee will 
continue to work in cooperation to ensure that risk behaviours 
and the management of risk issues over the course of the financial 
year are appropriately reflec ted in decisions taken about 
performance and reward. 
Full details of our risk management framework are included in the 
strategic report on pages 21 to 27.

Audit committee chairman’s  
annual statement 
The audit committee’s key role is to ensure there is confidence in 
the integrity of our processes and procedures as they relate to 
internal financial controls and corporate reporting. The board relies 
on the committee to review financial reporting and to appoint and 
oversee the work of the internal and external auditors.  
During 2017, the external environment and market conditions 
impacted Rathbones, which led to another busy year for the audit 
committee. The committee has considered a wide range of topics 
with a focus on the following areas: 
— analysis of the firm’s financial reporting with particular 
consideration of accounting judgments taken during the 
preparation of the financial statements 
— review of the firm’s client assets sourcebook (CASS) audit and 
submissions  
— impact of the reporting standards relating to IFRS 9 ‘Financial 
Instruments’, IFRS 15 ‘Revenue from Contracts with 
Customers’ and IFRS 16 ‘Leases’. 
In addition, the Financial Reporting Council (FRC) informed the 
company that it had reviewed the presentation of investment 
performance in the annual report for the year ended 31 December 
2016. The FRC stated that th e disclosure on investment 
performance metrics for asset managers should be expanded to 
provide additional information on the quartile rankings for fund 
performance. The firm submitted a response to the FRC, which 
included the information requested and consideration of potential 
disclosure in the future. The FRC confirmed in October 2017 that 
this matter was closed.

Committee meetings  
Our current members are the independent non-executive 
directors who met on six occasions in 2017 (2016: six).  
The board is satisfied that at le ast one member of the committee  
has recent and relevant financia l experience. I am a chartered 
accountant while the other co mmittee members have extensive 
experience of financial matters and of the financial services industry.  
In addition to the members of the committee, standing invitations 
are extended to the chairman, execut ive directors, chief risk officer, 
head of internal audit, financial controller, the external audit 
partner and manager. Other executives and external advisers are 
invited to attend the committee fr om time-to-time as required to 
present and advise on reports commissioned. 
During the year, I have regular meetings with the finance director, 
head of internal audit and the external audit partner to discuss key 
audit-related topics ahead of each meeting.  
Following the publication of the 2016 UK Corporate Governance 
Code (‘the Code’) and revised FRC Guidance for Audit Committees, 
the committee’s terms of reference were updated. The changes 
formalise the committee’s oversight of internal and external  
audit arrangements.  
The committee has an agreed annual standing agenda to ensure 
key areas are covered during the year, which it is required to 
address under its terms of reference. Prior to each meeting, I agree 
the agenda with the finance director and the company secretary. 
Committee effectiveness 
A formal and rigorous evaluation of the committee’s effectiveness 
was undertaken during the year as part of the external board 
effectiveness review. The review found that the committee was 
well run and performed at a high standard. For further 
information, please refer to the corporate governance report.

Financial reporting 
Accounting judgements 
As part of the committee’s role of monitoring the integrity of the 
firm’s financial information contained in the interim and annual 
financial statements, a review of key accounting judgements and 
policies that were adopted by management was conducted and 
assessed. Following discussion with management and the 
external auditors, the committee concluded that these 
judgements were appropriate and proportionate for the firm. 
Details of these key significant judgements can be found in note 2 
of the financial statements on page 126.  
Fair, balanced and understandable statement  
The committee considered whethe r the interim statement and 
report and accounts were fair, balanced and understandable and 
provided the information necessary for shareholders to assess the 
firm’s performance, business model and strategy. The committee 
reviewed the interim and annu al financial statements in 
conjunction with the narrative sections of the reports to ensure 
that there was consistency in the information reported, that 
appropriate weight had been given to both positive and negative 
aspects of business performance and that key messages had been 
presented coherently. The committee concluded that, taken as a 
whole, the interim statement and the annual report and accounts 
were fair, balanced and understandable. 
Viability and going concern 
The committee considered the re quirements contained in the 
Code regarding the company’s viability statement, including the 
proposed three-year assessment period. After significant 
discussion, and having considered the firm’s current position and 
impact of potential risks, the committee concluded that the three-
year assessment period cont inued to be appropriate and 
recommended the draft viability statement (as set out on page 28) 
to the board for approval. The committee also reviewed the going 
concern disclosure (as set out on page 105) and concluded that the 
firm had adequate resources to continue in operational existence 
for the foreseeable future and confirmed to the board that it was 
appropriate for the firm’s financial statements to be prepared on a 
going concern basis. 
The carrying value of assets 
We reviewed the methodology for valuing assets where a 
significant amount of judgement is required, including intangible 
assets, particularly goodwill and client relationships.  
The valuation of defined benefit pension obligations 
We reviewed the key assumptions supporting the valuation of 
defined benefit pension obligations, particularly salary increases, 
investment returns, inflation and the discount rate, which are 
disclosed in note 27 to the financial statements. We reviewed the 
professional advice taken by the company and discussed the 
assumptions used by us and by other companies with the 
external auditors. We satisfied ourselves that the assumptions 
used were reasonable. 
Provisions and contingent liabilities 
The committee discussed provisions totalling £23.7 million,  
which have been summarised in note 25 to the financial 
statements. The main areas of provisions relate to the recognition 
of the onerous lease relating to 1 Curzon Street, deferred payment 
for acquired business and property dilapidation liabilities.  
New accounting standards 
During the year, the committee reviewed three new accounting 
standards that will be implemen ted over the next two years  
and will impact on the financial statements as they will have a 
number of transitional arrangements. The committee looked at 
the following:  
i) IFRS 9 
Following a review of this standard internally and having 
received external advice, the committee ensured that the firm’s 
accounting policies and working models were updated to reflect 
the changes from this standard. It was noted that no material 
changes to the financial statements are anticipated as result of 
adopting this new standard.  
ii)  IFRS 15  
A review was conducted on the impact of this standard and the 
manner in which the firm is required to capitalise earn out 
payments. Following an extensive re view of our contracts, it was 
determined that the net impact of this standard would result in a 
£8 million adjustment to the op ening equity position and is 
disclosed in the financial statements.  
iii) IFRS 16 
A review of the firm’s future lease payments was conducted 
during the year to establish the potential financial liability that 
will need to be recognised on the balance sheet. The firm’s most 
significant property lease cont racts were examined and may 
lead to the firm being required to hold additional capital from 
the inception of the standard from (1 January 2019). 
For further information, please refer to note 1.3 to the financial 
statements on page 118.

Internal audit 
Internal audit plan 
The 2017 internal audit plan was approved by the committee 
ahead of the start of the year with a greater focus on thematic 
work. The internal audit plan is subject to an annual risk-based 
appraisal. In setting audit scope, the internal audit function will 
take into account business strategy and form an independent 
view of whether the key risks to the organisation have been 
identified, including emerging and systematic risks, and assess 
how effectively these risks are being managed. The status of 
scheduled work, and the follow-up of agreed actions arising from 
reviews is reviewed at each meeting, to ensure that agreed 
recommendations are acted upon promptly and regularly 
reported to the committee.  
At each meeting, the committe e reviewed the internal audit 
reports presented by the head of internal audit and monitored 
progress against the 2017 plan. In response to feedback from the 
committee, a number of changes were made to the format of the 
committee report to strengthen the focus on any significant issues 
identified in the audits and highlight any overdue items. Whilst no 
significant weaknesses were identified in any of the internal audit 
reports, a number of improvements to certain processes and 
controls were implemented in response to the recommendations 
put forward.  
Internal audit function 
The internal audit func tion is an independent, objective assurance 
activity designed to add value and improve the organisation’s 
operations by bringing a system atic, disciplined approach to 
evaluating and improving the effe ctiveness of risk management, 
control and governance processes. The internal audit function is 
the third line of defence within the controls framework, providing 
independent assurance to both senior management and the audit 
committee, and reporting to the chairman of the audit committee. 
Deloitte LLP were engaged on 1 July 2015 as a co-source partner 
supplementing the in-house team. Deloitte’s significant resource 
and knowledge base means they ar e able to provide specialist 
assistance supporting the annual internal audit planning process, 
as well as technical input into individual audit reviews. A 
combined assurance map has been developed, linking significant 
risks to first line controls, second line monitoring and oversight 
and internal audit work. 
The committee reviewed the effectiveness of the internal audit 
function during the year to assess whether the function continued 
to meet key stakeholder objectives. The outcome of this review 
indicated that the internal audit function continued to be effective, 
operating in line with profession al standards and well supported 
by Deloitte.  
As well as meetings with management, I have regular meetings  
on a one-to-one basis with the head of internal audit before audit 
committee meetings to ensure that any concerns can be raised  
in confidence. 
External audit 
Audit work 2017 
KPMG present their audit plan to the committee for review each 
year. The committee reviewed and challenged reports from 
KPMG, which outlined their risk assessments and audit plans for 
2017 (including their proposed materiality level for the 
performance of the annual audit), the status of their audit work 
and issues arising from it. Particul ar focus was given to their testing 
of internal controls, their work on the key judgement areas and 
possible audit adjustments. We can confirm that there are no such 
material items remaining unadjusted in the financial statements.  
External audit effectiveness and reappointment  
We place great importance on the quality, effectiveness and 
independence of the external audit process. In order to review the 
external audit process, including the performance of the external 
auditors, feedback is gathered from both committee members and 
management. This process was undertaken by internal audit. We 
also reviewed the annual FRC Audit Quality Inspection report 
prepared on our external auditor and discussed this report with 
the audit partner. The assessment of the auditor’s effectiveness 
forms part of our annual consid eration of whether the auditor 
should be recommended to the board for reappointment. We 
continue to believe that KPMG LL P are performing effectively and 
their reappointment will be recommended to shareholders at the 
2018 annual general meeting (AGM ). There are no contractual or 
similar obligations restricting the firm’s choice of external auditors. 
External audit review  
The committee is responsible for reviewing external audit 
arrangements and for any re commendation to the board 
regarding change of audit firm. This includes consideration of  
the external auditor’s period in office, their compensation and the 
scope, quality and cost-effectiveness of their work. The last audit 
services contract tender proces s was undertaken in June 2009, 
which led to the appointment of KPMG in 2009. We plan to 
undertake an audit services contract tender process and planning 
will commence during 2018. The committee is satisfied that the 
company has complied, during the financial year under review 
and up to the date of this report, with the provisions of the 
Statutory Audit Services for Large Companies Market 
Investigation (Mandatory Use of Competitor Tender Processes 
and Audit Committee Responsibilities) Order 2014. 
Auditor independence and non-audit services  
We discussed the independence of the external auditor, the  
nature of non-audit services supplied by them and non-audit fee 
levels relative to the audit fee. As a result of the EU Audit Directive 
and Audit Regulations, the non-audit services policy was updated 
and approved. The revised policy includes prohibited services  
and sets a fee guide that aims to achieve a target cap of 70% of  
the statutory audit fee in any year by 2019. The committee's  
prior approval is only required where the fee for an individual  
non-audit service is expected to exceed £50,000, and it is on the 
list of pre-approved services.  
74 Rathbone Brothers Plc Report and accounts 2017 rathbones.com  75  
Non-audit fees, excluding services re quired by national legislation, 
payable to the auditor in 2017 were £274,000. This represents 71% 
of the three-year average statutory audit fee of £385,000. Other 
non-audit work undertaken by the auditor in 2017 was largely in 
relation to the potential corporate transaction, pensions advisory 
work and the annual ISAE3402 internal controls report. We 
recognise that, given KPMG’s knowledge of the business, there are 
often advantages in using the external auditor to provide certain 
non-audit services and we are satisfied that their independence 
has not been impaired by provid ing these services. This was the 
case in respect of the work relating to the proposed corporate 
transaction during the year, which resulted in fees slightly 
exceeding the 70% target cap on non-audit services.  
Prior to undertaking any non-audit service, KPMG LLP also 
completes its own independence confirmation processes,  
which are approved by the engagement partner. To provide the 
committee with oversight in this area, it submits six-monthly 
reports on the non-audit services it has provided.  
Following a formal assessment of the external auditor’s 
independence and objectivity, the committee concluded that 
KPMG continued to be independent and objective.  
We agreed the external auditor’s fees (which are shown in note 7 
to the financial statements) and reviewed the audit engagement 
letter. We also had discussions with the external auditor with no 
management present to provide an opportunity for any concerns 
to be raised and discussed. 
Whistleblowing policy 
We annually review the firm’s whistleblowing policy, approve any 
changes to the document and receive details of any reports made. 
As well as meetings with management, I have regular meetings  
on a one-to-one basis with the head of internal audit before audit 
committee meetings to ensure that any concerns can be raised  
in confidence.  
Overview of priorities for 2018 
As well as considering the standing items of business, the 
committee will also focus on the following areas during 2018: 
— Initiation of the external audit tender process 
— Assessment and implementation of new accounting standards 
In light of its work, the committee was content with the 
effectiveness of the group’s processes governing financial and 
regulatory reporting and controls, its ethical standards and its 
relationships with regulators.  
Approval 
This report, in its entirety, has been approved by the committee 
and the board of directors and signed on its behalf by:

Membership and attendance 
Roles and responsibilities 
The responsibilities of the committee include reviewing the 
composition (including the skills, knowledge, experience and 
diversity) of the board and making recommendations to the 
board for the appointment of directors. The board as a whole 
then decides on any such appointment. 
The committee also has wider responsibilities for succession 
planning and the leadership n eeds of the organisation, both 
executive and non-executive, to ensure the continued ability 
of the firm to implement its st rategy and compete effectively 
in the marketplace. 
Full terms of reference for the committee are reviewed 
annually and are available on the company’s website. 
Nomination committee chairman’s  
annual statement  
The nomination committee’s primary focus this year has been on 
succession planning for the board and executive team.  
In April 2017, the committee agreed to recommend to the board that 
Jim Pettigrew be appointed senior independent director following the 
annual general meeting (AGM). In the following months, a number of 
informal discussions were held about the appropriate composition of 
the board in the event of a merger with Smith & Williamson. 
Following termination of these me rger discussions, the committee 
approved the appointment of Independent Audit Limited to carry 
out an external board effectiveness review. This generally positive 
review was discussed at the November nomination committee 
meeting prior to being presented to the board in December. 
A draft skills matrix was presented to the committee in November 
in the context of a wider discussi on about strategy and succession 
planning. As Kathryn Matthews, chairman of the group risk 
committee, will be close to the end of her nine year tenure as a 
director by the end of 2018, a jo b description for an experienced 
replacement non-executive director was approved in November 
and an independent search consultant, Zygos (now part of Russell 
Reynolds), was chosen to undertake the search. It was agreed that 
a second non-executive appointment would be made if an 
appropriate candidate is identified.  
During 2017, a number of discussions have taken place in the 
committee about identifying and developing future leaders  
within the firm. There has historically been a reluctance among 
investment managers to take on management responsibilities. 
The firm is addressing this by developing a broader management 
structure within investment management together, with a 
remuneration structure that encourages investment managers  
to take on management responsibilities.  
Succession planning and talent development 
As mentioned above, a key responsibility of the committee is to 
ensure that the board maintains a balance of skills, knowledge and 
experience appropriate to the operation of the business and 
required to deliver the strategy. During 2017, the committee 
reviewed the composition of the boa rd and considered (a) the core 
skills and experience of each director, (b) the independence of 
each director and (c) the diversity, including age and gender, of the 
board as a whole. This was used to develop a skills matrix which 
will underpin the evolution of the board. 
Following this review the committee was satisfied that the board 
continues to have an appropriate mix of skills, knowledge and 
experience to operate effectively. In addition to their professional 
skills, the directors have collectively many years of experience 
gained in a wide range of businesses and excellent track records in 
a range of sectors. During this process, the committee assessed 
areas which require further development or skills and experience 
that could be addressed through the recruitment of a new non-
executive director.

The committee also takes a keen interest in executive succession 
plans, which include executive directors, the group executive 
committee members and management roles across the business. 
Potential successors have been identified for many senior 
management positions and non-executive directors have met  
key individuals as part of normal board interactions and their  
visits to various teams in London and offices across the country. 
The committee continues to receive reports on the talent pipeline 
which identifies high-calibre individuals with management 
potential. The committee acknowledges that, in a company the 
size of Rathbones, there may no t always be successors for every 
senior role. The committee will continue to focus on this issue  
as a key part of its remit. 
Independence and conflicts of interest 
It is of the utmost importance that the board of a financial services 
firm has high-quality, experience d non-executive directors with 
the skills and integrity to undertake senior management roles.  
At Rathbones, we are fortunate to have such non-executives.  
I maintain a dialogue with each of them on potential conflicts of 
interest and time commitments. I am quite satisfied that in each 
case potential conflicts of interest are likely to be rare and will be 
handled appropriately by the indi vidual concerned. I have also 
been impressed by the whole-hearted commitment of all our non-
executive colleagues to Rathbones during a year in which they 
were often called upon to attend non-scheduled or informal 
meetings at short notice.  
All non-executive directors will be standing for re-election at the 
2018 AGM. 
Board diversity 
The board recognises the importance of diversity and that it is a 
wider issue than gender. We beli eve that members of the board 
should collectively possess a diverse range of skills, expertise, 
industry knowledge, business and other experience necessary for 
the effective oversight of the group. The nomination committee 
considers diversity as one of many factors when recommending 
new appointments to the board. For further information on our 
approach to diversity, please refe r to the corporate responsibility 
report on pages 43 to 56.  
Board effectiveness review  
Full details of the process and outcome of this review are set out 
on page 66. 
Looking forward 
We will continue to keep under review a succession timetable  
for both executives and non-execut ives. We will also monitor the 
development of management talent below board level in light  
of the Hampton Alexander review and encourage greater  
diversity and challenge management to develop the talent that 
exists in the firm.

minuted and copies of the mi nutes are sent to committee 
members and to the board. Ad hoc and informal meetings are held 
as required. 
Non-committee members are regularly invited to attend part  
of a meeting to report on a part icular aspect of our business and 
non-executive directors may also attend meetings. 
The committee has an agreed annual standing agenda to cover 
key areas in the year. Prior to ea ch meeting, I agree the agenda 
with the company secretary.  
What we have done 
Our main focus is on the implementation of the agreed strategy 
and on the day-to-day manageme nt of the group. We review 
and discuss the annual business plan and budget prior to 
its submission to the board for approval. We discuss the 
management and performance of the operating businesses 
(including their results compar ed to the budget, risks and 
regulatory compliance) and growth initiatives such as possible 
acquisitions and new products and services.  
Items of particular focus in 2017 were as follows:  
— Implementation of the strategic initiatives relating to Rathbone 
Financial Planning  
— Development of intermediary distribution channel 
— The move to new London premises 
— Implementation of an IT transformational programme 
— Implementation of regulatory changes relating to the General 
Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and MiFID II (Markets in 
Financial Instruments Directive) 
— Review of investment processes and development of the  
client journey 
— Review and assessment of annual budget

Our people are our main asset and so human resources (HR) 
matters and learning and development are important agenda 
items. The maintenance of, and improvement in, our core IT and 
operations infrastructure are key to the continuing success of the 
business and are subject to close scrutiny.  
The chief risk officer reports on the work of the risk and 
compliance teams and updates us on risk and internal control 
matters, as well as on industry developments. We receive updates 
from internal audit on their work schedule and discuss any 
significant issues they raise following their work. The head of 
internal audit may attend any meeting. We also have oversight of 
business units, banking matters, marketing, social and 
environmental matters, business continuity and investor relations. 
Overview of priorities for 2018 
As well as considering the standing items of business, the 
committee will also focus on the following areas during 2018: 
— Implementation of planned enhancements to our investment 
process 
— Implementation of our IT transformation programme  
— Implementation of new regulatory regimes including MiFID II 
and GDPR 
— Delivery of our strategic growth projects  
— Formulation of the next five-year strategic plan  
— Sub-let of our former Curzon Street premises

Remuneration committee chairman’s 
annual statement 
On behalf of the board, I am pleased to present my first directors’ 
remuneration report as chairman, having been appointed 
following the 2017 annual general meeting (AGM). I would like to 
thank my predecessor, David Harr el, for his contribution to the 
committee and support throughout my transition to this role. 
2017 has been a busy year for the remuneration committee. In 
addition to the committee’s usual activities, we have undertaken 
an extensive review of the remune ration policy, which applies to 
executive directors in order to ensure that it remains fit for 
purpose, aligned to our business strategy and supportive of the 
interests of shareholders and clients. We have also ensured that 
the key principles of the remuneration policy are consistently 
applied to executive committee members. 
As part of this process, I had the opportunity to meet with a 
number of our larger shareholders to discuss our proposed 
revisions to our remuneration policy that will apply for the next 
three years. I would personally like to thank them all for their 
valuable and considered input into this process. Their feedback 
has been very helpful in info rming the committee’s view.  
2017 performance and remuneration outcomes  
Our remuneration framework is closely aligned with the financial 
performance of the group, which has been strong in 2017 as 
continued growth and robust investment markets helped funds 
under management reach £39.1 billion at 31 December 2017. This 
performance is reflected in the 17.6% growth in 2017 profit before 
tax to £58.9 million and an underlyi ng operating margin of 30.6%.  
Consequently, these financial outc omes are directly reflected in 
the respective elements of the Executive Incentive Plan (EIP), 
which delivered above target performance in respect of three-year 
return on capital employed (ROCE) , annual profit before tax and 
underlying operating margin. Due largely to the non-underlying 
costs associated with the relocation of our London office, 
threshold performance in respect of earnings per share (EPS) was 
not achieved. Similarly, whilst th e total net organic growth of our 
Investment Management and Unit Trusts businesses in 2017 was 
5.2%, this was not enough to meet the 5.5% threshold.  
Positive progress was made during the year on the non-financial 
objectives which cover critical project performance, stakeholder 
measures and client experience. We have set out in more detail 
the EIP results for 2017 on page 95. 
80 Rathbone Brothers Plc Report and accounts 2017  rathbones.com  81  
A new remuneration policy for 2018 
In line with our now established three-year cycle, a new 
remuneration policy is being put forward to our shareholders  
for approval at our AGM in May 2018. In setting this policy,  
the priorities for the committee have been to ensure that 
remuneration structures and performance measures: 
— support the future strategy of ou r business, reflecting the need 
for investment at different times in the market cycle and the 
opportunities for inorganic growth that may arise 
— align the reward received by our executive directors and the 
experience and interests of our shareholders 
— continue to comply with regulations and industry best practice. 
A summary of the proposed changes to our policy is set out below, 
with further details presented on pages 86 and 87. 
1. There are no material changes to the EIP structure, but we have 
increased the level of disclosure 
We operate one single incentive plan for executive directors, 
the EIP (which combines both short and long term metrics) 
and recognise that it is atypical in the market. We believe, 
however, that it continues to work well in incentivising 
positive business and financial performance and aligning the 
interests of executive directors with our shareholders and 
clients. We therefore propose to retain the EIP structure in its 
current form. 
The committee has, however, recognised that market 
practice has moved on since the policy was last approved. 
From a shareholder perspective, the key difference in our 
approach when compared with a more traditional annual 
bonus and long-term incentive construct, is the additional 
disclosure of long-term performance metrics that accompany 
separate long-term incentive schemes. This year, therefore, 
we will disclose, on a forward-looking basis, the long-term 
performance ranges against which we will be assessing 
performance. This aims to improve transparency for 
shareholders as to the performa nce ranges that will apply to 
the long-term elements of our plan. The long-term targets for 
the 2018–2020 cycle are disclosed on page 87 of this report.  
2. Increase the maximum opportunity under the EIP from 200% 
to 300% of salary and retained holding restrictions 
Our existing remuneration policy was introduced at a time 
when there was significant regulatory uncertainty as to 
whether smaller banks would be required to comply with 
new bonus capping requirements introduced under the 
Capital Requirements Directive. 
In response to this uncertainty, and anticipating that this 
would be likely to become requir ed practice across the sector, 
a maximum 200% cap was included in our remuneration 
policy (which was approved in advance of any clarification 
from the regulator regarding its expectation). Our approach, 
however, reserved the firm’s position regarding fixed salaries 
until the regulations became clearer. 
The UK regulator has since confirmed that it does not expect 
smaller banks, including Rathbones, to comply with this 
capping requirement. In reviewing our remuneration policy, 
the committee has concluded that this cap has reduced total 
remuneration levels to an uncompetitive level when 
compared to peers, who, as non-banks, did not (and were not 
required to) apply the cap in a similar way.

Governance Remuneration committee report continued 
82 Rathbone Brothers Plc Report and accounts 2017 
The committee discussed at length the appropriateness of 
increasing the maximum opportunity of the EIP in the 
current environment, recognising the wider sensitivities and 
market focus on executive pay and the award quantum at 
this time. We placed considerable emphasis on the 
importance to shareholders an d stakeholders of ensuring 
that the remuneration arrangements we have in place were 
sufficiently competitive and appropriate both for current and 
any future executives.  
In order to increase alignment with performance, it was 
determined that any increase should be applied to the 
incentive element of the plan (as opposed to fixed pay). In 
setting the quantum of the award, the committee observed 
that the proposed package for the executive directors was 
consistent with the lower quartile of our competitive market. 
This reflected the committee’s de sire to balance the need for 
an award increase with any concerns on pay ratcheting 
and/or excessive focus on benchmarking. The committee 
reaffirmed the current five-year holding and vesting 
provisions associated with all deferred share awards to 
ensure that executive director interests were aligned  
for the longer term. 
Recognising the wider sensitivities to increasing quantum, 
the committee was very keen to test the proposal with 
shareholders as part of a consultation process before 
finalising its decision. The committee gained a high level of 
confidence from this process as a significant majority of the 
shareholders consulted (which covered 50% of our register) 
understood the changes and were very supportive, noting 
the context of current relatively modest salary levels and 
lower leverage compared to other listed peers. 
3. Increase in the weighting of pe rformance metrics linked to both 
the long-term and financial performance, whilst removing 
personal objectives 
In the consultation process, some shareholders did highlight  
a desire for a greater proportion of the EIP to be based on 
financial metrics only, to ensure that only a similar proportion 
of the total EIP award as a percentage of base salary could be 
earned from the non-financ ial components. We have 
accordingly amended the weightings of our performance 
measures to reduce the non-financial weighting and have 
removed the personal component altogether. 
The personal objective element (20%) has been replaced with  
a 5% increase in the strategic element, a 5% increase to the 
short-term financial metrics and a 10% increase to the long-
term financial metrics. Overall, this means the EIP will be 80% 
weighted towards financial metrics, of which 50% are 
weighted to long-term. This, combined with the five-year 
deferral and full restriction on share sales over this period, 
means a significant portion of this plan is measured over 
eight years. In removing the personal element, the committee 
noted the tension between investors’ desire for less 
subjectivity and the desire of UK regulators to align conduct 
with remuneration. 
Our policy requires that a minimum of 70% of the EIP will  
be based on financial performance measures. This is to 
ensure that the committee has maximum flexibility to 
change the weightings of these different elements as 
appropriate. This is importan t, recognising that we are 
coming towards the end of our current five-year strategy 
planning period and require an incentive structure which can 
support any refinements of our strategy in 2019. We would 
consult with shareholders before making any changes to the 
weightings as they have been implemented for 2018. 
82 Rathbone Brothers Plc Report and accounts 2017  rathbones.com  83  
4. Other changes  
In order to align to best practice and the expectations of our 
shareholders, the current shareholding requirements applied 
to our executive directors will increase to 200% from the 
current 100% of base salary. In addition, new post-cessation 
holding requirements will also apply, requiring our executive 
directors to continue to meet the shareholding requirements 
in full for at least one year post-cessation, and to continue to 
meet 50% of the shar eholding requirements for the second 
year post-cessation. 
In light of other changes, the committee felt it appropriate to 
reduce the maximum policy level of pension contributions 
for the executive directors from 14% of base salary to 12%. 
This change aligns more closely to the maximum level of 
pension contributions of the majority of our wider workforce. 
Our new remuneration policy will have immediate effect, 
subject to approval from our shareholders. 
Further detail on the new remuneration policy and more 
detail on these changes can be found on pages 86 and 91, 
respectively. 
 
Fees and salaries 
The 2018 budget for salary increa ses across the company is set at 
around 3.5%. In setting directors’ remuneration, the committee 
takes into account the pay and employment conditions of all our 
employees, the performance of the firm and the views of 
shareholders and their representatives. Remuneration 
arrangements at other firms of similar size and complexity are also 
reviewed for guidance. The commi ttee will continue to use a 
number of reference points to determine future pay structure, 
quantum and peer group positioning for executive directors and 
members of the executive committee. 
Conclusion 
I hope that you find the information in this letter and sections  
of the directors remuneration report clear and useful. The 
remuneration landscape continues to be the subject of many 
political and regulatory policy changes and, as these evolve, the 
committee will ensure that our policy and practices change to be 
compliant, balancing the need to remain performance-driven and 
competitive. I welcome any feedback you may have during the 
year and hope to receive your support for the approval of the 
remuneration policy.

Directors’ remuneration policy 
The directors’ remuneration policy (‘Policy’) outlined below includes the proposed changes set out in the remuneration committe e 
chairman’s annual statement, and describes the policies, principles and structures that guide the remuneration committee’s decisions on 
executive remuneration. If approved at the AGM in May 2018, it will apply for a period of three years from the date of the 2018 AGM unless 
a revised Policy is put to shareholders before then. 
Executive directors 
Base salary 
Purpose and link to strategy Operation Opportunity Applicable performance measures Recovery 
The core, fixed component 
of the package designed to 
enable the recruitment and 
retention of high-calibre 
individuals. 
Base salaries are reviewed 
annually on 1 January and 
are compared to salaries in 
other companies of similar 
size and complexity to 
ensure that a competitive 
rate is being paid. 
Adjustments may be made 
at other times to reflect a 
change of responsibility. 
There is no maximum base 
salary, but percentage 
increases will normally be no 
higher than the general level 
of increase for the wider 
employee population, unless 
there are special 
circumstances such as a 
material change of 
responsibilities or where a 
salary is significantly below 
market median and is being 
brought into line. 
Not applicable. Not applicable. 
Benefits 
Purpose and link to strategy Operation Opportunity Applicable performance measures Recovery 
Benefits are typically 
provided to directors to be 
generally consistent with 
other employees and to 
complement the 
remuneration package to 
ensure that it is sufficiently 
competitive. 
Benefits are set by the 
committee and may include, 
for example: 
— private medical 
insurance for directors 
and their dependants 
— death in service cover 
— Share Incentive Plan 
free and matching 
shares 
— Save As You Earn

— annual medicals 
— limited legal and

Executive Incentive Plan  
Purpose and link to strategy Operation Opportunity Applicable performance measures Recovery 
The EIP rewards short-term 
performance, the 
achievement of corporate 
and individual goals and 
aligns the interests of 
shareholders and directors 
in creating long-term 
shareholder value.  
The performance measures 
as described have been 
selected to support the 
controlled delivery of our 
business strategy as set out 
in the strategic report. 
EIP awards are paid in cash 
(40%) and deferred 
Rathbones shares (60%), 
which vest over a five-year 
period in equal tranches of 
20% per annum. A full five-
year sale restriction period 
will operate from the date of 
the award and will continue 
to operate for directors who 
have left the company. 
Directors will not be 
permitted to sell shares 
during the sale restriction 
period except for the 
purpose of meeting tax 
liabilities on vesting. 
Deferred awards are 
increased by notional 
adjustments for dividends 
paid until vesting, calculated 
using shares held at the 
record date. 
The committee has the 
discretion to make changes 
to its EIP policy where 
required under regulations. 
The maximum EIP award is 
300% of base salary. 
Target performance is 60% 
of maximum.  
Threshold performance is 
25% of maximum. 
Actual awards for 
performance above or 
below target performance 
are calculated on a straight-
line basis between threshold 
and maximum. 
The EIP is based on the 
remuneration committee’s 
assessment of financial and 
non-financial performance 
against a balanced 
scorecard of measures, 
which are aligned to the 
company’s strategy. 
No less than 70% of the EIP 
will be based on financial 
measures. The remainder 
will be based on non-
financial performance 
measured against strategic 
objectives. 
At least 50% of the EIP will 
be based on long-term 
financial performance. 
The performance metrics 
and range of outcomes for 
each financial measure (one 
year and three year trailing) 
are set by the committee 
and reviewed annually. 
Additional considerations 
The remuneration 
committee may make an 
adjustment when 
determining the overall 
award, including to zero if 
appropriate, to take account 
of any of the following 
material events: 
— underlying financial 
performance 
— risk management or 
regulatory compliance 
issues 
— personal performance. 
All unvested awards will 
normally lapse on termination 
of office unless the 
termination was as a ‘good 
leaver’. A good leaver is a 
director who leaves on 
retirement, due to injury or 
disability, on the sale of the 
business or in any other 
circumstances where the 
committee determines good 
leaver treatment is 
appropriate in relation to the 
malus/clawback there is a 
slight misalignment between 
the policy and the provisions 
of the rules. The rules provide 
that malus/clawback can be 
applied at any time up to 7 
years from the date of grant in 
the case of share awards and 
7 years from the payment of 
cash on cash awards. The 
vesting schedule for the share 
awards is 20% p.a. over 5 
years. The policy provides that 
clawback can be applied up to 
3 years from vesting.  
In all but the 5th tranche of 
share awards, the rules grant 
the power to effect the 
clawback in line with the 
terms of the policy (the rules 
actually give more power but 
the remuneration committee 
could choose not to exercise it 
if to do so would be more 
onerous than the policy). The 
last tranche of the share 
awards could, in theory (under 
the policy), be clawed back up 
to 8 years from the date of 
award. This is wider than the 
power given under the rules 
so it would be necessary to 
change the rules to ensure 
that the policy could be 
complied with. As this would 
be a detrimental change to 
participants, it could be made 
without shareholder approval 
being required.

Key changes to the remuneration policy 
The new Policy for which approval is being sought at the AGM in May 2018 is similar in structure to the Policy that was previou sly 
approved by shareholders at the 2015 AGM. As such, we propose to maintain the structure of our variable award, but as amended by the 
changes set out in the table below. 
Remuneration 
elements Aspect Overview of changes Rationale 
Executive 
Incentive Plan  
Maximum opportunity  Increase from 200% to 300% To ensure that maximum opportunity levels of 
the current executive directors remain 
competitive following the clarification of UK 
bank regulations. 
Executive 
Incentive Plan 
Nature of performance 
measures 
Weightings of 
performance measures 
Removal of the personal performance element, to be 
replaced with a 5% increase to the strategic element,  
a 5% increase to the short-term financial metrics and  
a 10% increase to the long-term financial metrics 
Performance weightings are now 80% derived from 
financial outcomes (was 65%), with the remaining 
20% assessed against strategic objectives. 
To orientate awards more objectively towards 
financial performance overall with now a 50% 
weighting linked to the longer term. 
Pension 
contributions  
Maximum opportunity  Reduction from 14% to 12% To align the Policy more closely with the 
majority of other employees. 
Shareholding 
requirements 
Level of shareholding Increased from 100% to 200% To align to emerging best practice and to 
increase alignment with shareholder interests. 
Shareholding 
requirements 
Post-cessation holding Introduced for the first time. A requirement for 
executive directors to retain 200% of base salary in 
the first year post-cessation in shares and 100% of 
base salary in the second year post-cessation. 
To align to emerging best practice and to 
increase alignment with shareholder interests. 
Definition of performance metrics 
The EIP performance metrics chosen by the committee are key indicators of performance used by the business and shareholders whi ch 
are detailed below. 
a) One-year financial measures: incentivises the delivery of strong 
financial performance for our shareholders in the relevant 
financial year 
b) Three-year financial measures: aligns the delivery of strong, 
sustainable financial performance for our shareholders over the 
longer term 
c) Non-financial measures: links executive performance to the 
delivery of key strategic initiatives and projects that support the 
firm’s business plan 
The committee reviews the specific choice of performance metrics fo r the EIP on an annual basis at the beginning of each financ ial year to 
ensure that the nature and weighting of th ese remain appropriate to ensure alignment between the interests of our executive dir ectors, 
our business strategy and the interests of our clients and shareholders. Further detail on how the specific choice of measures for the 2018 
EIP links to our strategic goals is provided on page 87. 
The targets for these measures are considered annually by the committee and are set to encourage stretching levels of performan ce 
without inadvertently motivating inappropriate behavior. Rathbones will prospectively disclose the target ranges for three-year financial 
measures, but will not disclose any of the one-year measures on a prospective basis as these are considered commercially sensit ive 
(however actual performance against these will be retrospectively disclosed).

92 Rathbone Brothers Plc Report and accounts 2017 
The use of discretion 
The committee may make minor amendments to the Policy set 
out above (for regulatory, exchange control, tax or administrative 
purposes or to take account of a change in legislation) without 
obtaining shareholder approval for that amendment. In relation to 
the EIP, the committee retains discretion when selecting 
participants, determining the treatment of leavers, agreeing the 
timing of awards and reviewing the balanced scorecard of 
performance measures, targets and weightings. The committee 
reserves the right to adjust retrospectively performance measures 
and targets if events (for example, a major acquisition) make them 
inappropriate. Adjustments will not be made to make the 
conditions materially easier to satisfy.  
The committee reserves the right to make any remuneration 
payments, and payments for loss of office (including exercising 
any discretions available to it in connection with such payments), 
notwithstanding that they are not in line with the Policy where  
the terms of the payment were agreed (i) before the Policy came 
into effect or (ii) at a time when the relevant individual was not  
a director of the company and, in the opinion of the committee, 
the payment was not in consideration for the individual becoming 
a director of the company. For these purposes, payments include 
awards of variable remuneration and, in relation to an award  
over shares, the associated terms agreed at the time the award  
is granted. 
Consultation 
The company consulted extensively with major shareholders and 
their representative bodies on re muneration issues, including in 
the development of this new directors’ remuneration Policy. While 
we did not consult explicitly with employees on this new Policy, 
the committee took account of remuneration policies elsewhere 
in the group. 
Appointment of new directors 
For new executive and non-executive directors, the structure of 
the package offered will mirror that provided to current directors 
under the new directors’ remuneration Policy. The package 
quantum will depend on the role and the experience and 
background of the new director. Advice from our remuneration 
consultants will be taken to ensure that the package is in line  
with median market levels for companies of similar size and 
complexity. Any future variable award will be made within the 
300% maximum (subject to shareholder approval). 
The company may pay compensation to new directors for 
remuneration the individual has forfeited in order to take up the 
role with Rathbones. Rathbones will ensure that these awards are 
no more generous in either amount or terms than the awards they 
replace. These awards may be structured differently from awards 
made under our standard directors’ remuneration Policy in order 
to best reflect the remuneration being forfeited. 
Service contracts 
It is company policy that service contracts should not normally 
contain notice periods of more than 12 months. Details of the 
notice periods in the contracts of employment of executive 
directors serving during the year are as shown below. 
Executive director Date of contract Notice period
P L Howell 12 Feb 2013 12 months
R P Stockton 14 Oct 2011 6 months
There are no provisions within the contracts to provide automatic 
payments in excess of payment in lieu of notice upon termination 
by the company and no predetermined compensation package 
exists in the event of terminatio n of employment. Payment in lieu 
of notice would include basic salary, pension contributions and 
benefits. There are no provisions for the payment of liquidated 
damages or any statements in respect of the duty of mitigation. In 
the event of entering into a termination agreement, the board will 
take steps to impose a legal obliga tion on the director to mitigate 
any loss incurred. There are no clauses in contracts amending 
employment terms and conditions on a change of control. 
Executive directors’ contracts of service, which include details of 
remuneration, are available for inspection at the company’s 
registered office and will be available for inspection at the AGM. 
Non-executive directors have a letter of appointment rather than a 
contract of employment and these are available for inspection at 
the AGM. As with all other directors, they are required to stand for 
re-election annually in accordance with the UK Corporate 
Governance Code. The effectiveness of the non-executive 
directors is subject to an annual assessment. Any term beyond six 
years is subject to particularly rigorous review and takes into 
account the need for progressive refreshing of the board. The 
executive directors are responsible for determining the fees of the 
non-executive directors.  
92 Rathbone Brothers Plc Report and accounts 2017  
 rathbones.com  93  
Payments for loss of office 
Compensation payments will be determined on a case-by-case 
basis in the light of current market practice. Compensation will 
include loss of salary and other co ntractual benefits, but mitigation 
will be applied where appropriate. 
Any entitlement to EIP awards will depend on whether the 
individual is treated as a good or bad leaver, in line with the  
table below. 
Status Definition  Treatment
Good leaver Leave for reasons including 
retirement, ill health, sale  
of the business and any 
other reason as the 
committee determines. 
 All unvested awards 
will be delivered in 
line with the existing 
vesting schedule. 
Awards in the year of 
departure will be 
made at the 
discretion of the 
committee 
depending on the 
circumstances at 
the time and, if 
made, will be 
reduced to reflect 
time served 
Bad leaver Leave for other reasons 
unless the committee 
determines otherwise. 
 All unvested awards 
will normally lapse. 
Other directorships 
The board believes that the firm can benefit from experience 
gained when executive directors hold non-executive 
directorships. Executive directors are permitted to hold external 
appointments and to receive payments, provided such 
appointments are agreed by the board in advance, there no 
conflicts of interests and the appointment does not lead to 
deterioration in the executive’s performance. 
Consideration of remuneration across the firm 
The committee provides oversight of remuneration structures 
across the firm, including members of the group executive 
committee, material risk takers and the risk and compliance teams. 
In addition, the committee reviews on an annual basis total 
remuneration costs across the firm in light of its short- and  
longer-term financial targets and ongoing sustainability. 
The committee is well aware of the remuneration structures 
across the firm and takes these into consideration when taking 
decisions on remuneration for executive directors. 
Legacy arrangements 
Authority is given to the committee to honour previous 
remuneration awards or arrangements entered into with current 
or former directors (such as th e payment of a pension or the 
unwinding of legacy share schemes). Details of any payments will 
be set out in the annual report on remuneration as they arise. 
Difference between directors’ remuneration policy  
and other employees 
All employees, including executive directors, benefit from fixed 
and variable pay, pension and non-cash benefits. The company 
operates a number of variable remuneration schemes within the 
group, some fully discretionary, others with mechanistic elements 
in addition to a discretionary element. Membership of such 
schemes is defined by status and job type. Only executive 
committee members are eligible to benefit from membership  
of an EIP.

Annual report on remuneration 
This part of the directors’ remuneration report explains how we 
have implemented our remuneration policy during the year in line 
with the remuneration policy that was approved by shareholders 
at the 2015 AGM. This annual report on remuneration will be 
subject to an advisory vote at the 2018 AGM. The financial 
information in this part of the directors’ remuneration report has 
been audited where indicated.  
Role of remuneration committee 
The role of the committee is to set the overarching principles of 
the remuneration Policy and provide oversight on remuneration 
across the firm. Details of the committee’s responsibilities and 
composition are detailed above. At the invitation of the committee 
chairman, the chief executive, finance director and the head of 
strategy and organisation development attend some or all of each 
meeting. The chief risk officer also advises the committee on 
matters relating to remuneration and attends meetings as 
required. The company secretary acts as secretary and, with the 
chairman, agrees the agenda for each meeting.  
At the end of each meeting, there is an opportunity for private 
discussion between committee members without the presence of 
management. No committee member or attendee is present when 
matters relating to his or her own remuneration are discussed.

Relative importance of spend on pay 
The chart below shows the relationship between total employee 
remuneration, profit after tax and dividend distributions for 2017 
and 2016. The reported profit afte r tax has been selected by the 
directors as a useful indicato r when assessing the relative 
importance of spend on pay.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Implementation of the remuneration 
policy in 2018 
In 2018, the remuneration policy will be applied in a similar way  
to 2017, albeit with the changes to reflect the new directors’ 
remuneration policy outlined above if approved. Salary 
adjustments awarded to executive directors for 2018 are  
noted below. 
Salary 
The executive directors’ salaries for 2018 is noted below. These are 
in line with the awards made to the general employee base. Paul

Pensions and benefits 
Pensions and benefits will be delivered in line with the 
remuneration policy. Pension benefits for the year will be 12%, 
which is in line with the new maximum opportunity of 12%. 
EIP 2018 – forward looking targets 
The 2018 EIP (which would be awarded in 2019), subject to 
performance, will be delivered in line with the new remuneration 
policy, which allows for a maximum award level of 300% of base 
salary. While the committee is able to make awards up to this new 
maximum award level, actual award levels will continue to be 
determined by the committee base d on a robust assessment of 
performance during the 2018 performance year. 
Incentive awards under the EIP will continue to be linked to a 
scorecard of short and longer term financial metrics, and annual 
objectives covering financial and non-financial criteria. Annual 
targets set for 2018 will take into account the amount of 
expenditure and investment approv ed by the board in the 2018 
budget to develop the business and support its growth initiatives. 
The committee will not, at this time, disclose any of the remaining 
one year measures on a prospective basis as these are considered 
commercially sensitive (however actual performance against 
these will be disclosed). 
Whilst recognising the potentia l volatility associated with 
investment markets and its direct impact on the financial 
outcomes for Rathbones, the committee believes earnings per 
share and underlying ROCE measures continue to be appropriate 
measures to use when assessing lo nger term performance targets.  
Long term targets for the 2018-20 award period, have accordingly 
been set as outlined in the ta ble below. When establishing 
performance ranges for these ta rgets, the committee has been 
particularly mindful of the historic performance of the business in 
different market conditions, the continuing need for investment in 
the business and the increase in regulatory capital buffers in 2018 
and 2019 required by Capital Requ irements Regulations (see pages 
38 to 41).  
Performance measure Threshold  Maximum 
Three year CAGR EPS 5% 15%
Three year underlying average ROCE 14% 20%
In respect of the two open-award years to 31 December 2019, the 
committee has set a threshold and maximum of 4% to 14% 
respectively for the three year EPS performance measure, and 14% 
to 20% for three year underlying ROCE. The committee may also 
make adjustments to performance targets to reflect significant 
one-off events (e.g. a material transaction), where considered 
appropriate and reasonable. Clear disclosure will be provided in 
this instance regarding the nature and materiality of any change in 
the directors’ remuneration report for the relevant financial year.

line with the growth of the busine ss over each econom ic cycle. This 
means that there may be periods where the dividend is maintained 
but not increased and periods wher e profits are retained rather 
than distributed to maintain re tained reserves and regulatory 
capital at prudent levels through troughs and peaks in the cycle. 
Share capital 
The company’s share capital comprises one class of ordinary 
shares of 5p each. At 31 December 2017, 51,302,074 shares were in 
issue (2016: 50,682,679). No shares were held in treasury (2016: 
8,979). Details of the movements during the year are set out in 
note 28 to the financial statements. The shares carry no rights to 
fixed income and each share carries the right to one vote at 
general meetings. All shares are fully paid. 
There are no specific restrictions on the size of a shareholding or 
on the transfer of shares, which are both covered by the provisions 
of the Articles of Associatio n and prevailing legislation. 
New issues of share capital 
Under section 551 of the Companies Act 2006, the board currently 
has the authority to allot 16,894,680 shares (approximately one 
third of the issued share capital at 31 March 2017). The existing 
authorities given to the company at the last annual general 
meeting (AGM) to allot shares will expire at the conclusion of the 
forthcoming AGM. Details of the resolutions renewing these 
authorities are included in the Notice of AGM. 
Awards under the company’s employee share plans are satisfied 
from a combination of shares held either in treasury or in the 
employee benefit trust and by ne wly issued shares. During the 
year, the company transferred 8,979 shares out of treasury for a 
total consideration of £160,000, issued 181,712 shares to satisfy 
share awards and issued 437, 683 shares to the company’s 
employee benefit trust, to satisfy future awards under the group’s 
share-based payment schemes. 
Purchase of own shares 
Following the 2017 AGM, resolution to purchase own shares,  
the board currently has the authority to buy back up to  
2,500,000 shares under certain stringent conditions. During the 
year, the company did not utilise this authority but the board 
considers it would be appropriate to renew it. We intend to  
seek shareholder approval for the continued authority to  
purchase own shares at the fo rthcoming AGM in line with  
current investor sentiment.  
Details of the resolution renewing the authority are included in  
the Notice of AGM.

Auditor 
The audit committee reviews the appointment of the external 
auditor and their relationship with the group, including monitoring 
the group’s use of the auditor for non-audit services. Note 7 to the 
financial statements sets out details of the auditor’s remuneration. 
Having reviewed the independence and effectiveness of the external 
auditor, the audit committee has recommended to the board that the 
existing auditor, KPMG LLP, be reappointed and a resolution 
appointing KPMG LLP as auditor and authorising the directors to set 
their remuneration will be pr oposed at the 2018 AGM. 
The directors in office at the date of signing of this report confirm 
that, so far as they are aware, there is no relevant audit information 
of which the auditor is unaware and that each director has taken 
all steps that he or she ought to have taken to make him or 
herselfaware of any relevant audit information and to establish 
that the auditor is awar e of that information. 
Going concern 
Details of the group’s business ac tivities, results, cash flows and 
resources, together with the risks it faces and other factors likely  
to affect its future development, performance and position are set 
out in the chairman’s statement, chief executive’s review, strategic 
report and group risk committee report. In addition, note 1.5 to the 
financial statements provides further details. 
The group companies are regulated by the PRA and FCA and 
perform annual capital adequacy assessments, which include the 
modelling of certain extreme st ress scenarios. The company 
publishes Pillar 3 disclosures annually on its website, which 
provide detail about its regulatory capital resources and 
requirements. In July 2015, Rathbone Investment Management 
issued £20 million of 10-year subo rdinated loan notes to finance 
future growth. The group has no other external borrowings. 
In 2017, the group has continued to generate organic growth in 
client funds under management and this is expected to continue. 
The directors believe that the comp any is well placed to manage 
its business risks successfully de spite the continuing uncertain 
economic and political outlook. As the directors have a reasonable 
expectation that the co mpany has adequate resources to continue 
in operational existence for the foreseeable future, they continue 
to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing the 
annual financial statements.  
Political donations 
No political donations were made during the year (2016: nil). 
Post-balance sheet events 
Details of post-balance sheet events are set out in note 37 to the

adopted by the European Union (IFRS as adopted by the EU) and 
applicable law and have elected to prepare the parent company

operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.  
The directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting 
records that are sufficient to show and explain the parent 
company’s transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at 
any time the financial position of the parent company and enable 
them to ensure that its financial statements comply with the

Financial statements Independent auditor’s report to the members of Rathbone Brothers Plc 
108 Rathbone Brothers Plc Report and accounts 2017

We have audited the financial statements of Rathbone Brothers 
Plc for the year ended 31 December 2017 which comprise the 
consolidated statement of comprehensive income, consolidated 
statement of changes in equity , consolidated balance sheet, 
consolidated statement of cash flows, company statement of 
changes in equity, company balance sheet and company 
statement of cash flows, and the related notes, including the 
accounting policies in note 1 and 39.  
In our opinion:  
— the financial statements give a true and fair view of the state  
of the group’s and of the parent company’s affairs as at  
31 December 2017 and of the group’s profit for the year  
then ended;  
— the group financial statements have been properly prepared  
in accordance with International Financial Reporting 
Standards as adopted by the Eu ropean Union (IFRS as adopted 
by the EU);  
— the parent company financial statements have been properly 
prepared in accordance with IFRS as adopted by the EU and as 
applied in accordance with the provisions of the Companies 
Act 2006; and  
— the financial statements have been prepared in accordance 
with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 and,  
as regards the group financial statements, Article 4 of the  
IAS Regulation.  
Basis for opinion  
We conducted our audit in accordance with International 
Standards on Auditing (UK) (‘ISAs (UK)’) and applicable law. Our 
responsibilities are described in the next paragraph. We believe 
that the audit evidence we have obtained is a sufficient and 
appropriate basis for our opinion. Our audit opinion is consistent 
with our report to the audit committee. 
We were appointed as auditor by the shareholders on 9 June 
2009. The period of total uninterrupted engagement is for the nine 
financial years ended 31 December 2017. We have fulfilled our 
ethical responsibilities under, and we remain independent of the 
group in accordance with, UK ethical requirements including the 
FRC Ethical Standard as applied to listed public interest entities. 
No non-audit services prohibited by that standard were provided. 
2 Key audit matters: our assessment of 
risks of material misstatement  
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional 
judgement, were of most significance in the audit of the financial 
statements and include the most significant assessed risks of 
material misstatement (whether or not due to fraud) identified by 
us, including those which had the greatest effect on: the overall 
audit strategy, the allocation of resources in the audit and directing 
the efforts of the engagement team. We summarise below the key 
audit matters, in decreasing order of audit significance, in arriving 
at our audit opinion above, together with our key audit procedures 
to address those matters and, as required for public interest 
entities, our results from those procedures. These matters were 
addressed, and our results are base d on procedures undertaken, in 
the context of, and solely for the purpose of, our audit of the 
financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion 
thereon, and consequently are incidental to that opinion, and we 
do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. 
Recognition and impairment of client relationship 
intangibles. Amount capitalised during the year 
£2,743,000 (2016: £7,926,000), amount expensed as 
capitalisation criteria not met £5,094,000 (2016: 
£4,005,000) and carrying balance of client relationship 
intangible £88,511,000 (2016: £97,201,000)  
Risk vs 2016:  
Refer to page 73 (audit committee report), page 124 (accounting 
policy) and pages 126 and 14 0 (financial disclosures). 
The risk – accounting application in relation to recognition of client 
relationship intangibles 
The group has capitalised sign ificant amounts as client 
relationship intangibles, including both those purchased 
individually (initially recognised at cost) and those acquired as part 
of a business combinat ion (initially recognised at fair value). 
  
108 Rathbone Brothers Plc Report and accounts 2017  
  Rathbone Brothers Plc Report and accounts 2017 109 
The key judgement areas our audit concentrated on were: 
— The group makes contractual payments to its investment 
managers for introducing new client relationships. For newly 
recruited managers, the group capitalises payments that are 
deemed to represent the transfer of existing client relationships 
already held by the investme nt manager. The group has 
determined the appropriate accounting policy is to capitalise 
payments made to investment managers in respect of 
previously held client relationships transferred to the group 
during the 12 month period after the conclusion of any ‘non-
compete’ arrangements between an investment manager and 
their previous employer. The capitalisation period is extended 
beyond 12 months in exceptional circumstances, where 
management consider that the investment manager is 
introducing previously held client relationships beyond that 
period; during the year payments were capitalised outside the 
12 month earn-out period. There is a risk that payments are 
inappropriately capitalised outside of the 12 month period or 
that they do not relate to client relationships previously held by 
the investment manager. 
The risk – accounting application in relation to impairment of client 
relationship intangibles 
— For client relationship intangib les, the group assesses whether 
there is an indication of impairment considering a range of 
impairment triggers. Where such an indication exists, the group 
considers whether the ongoing benefits offered by the 
capitalised client relationship intangibles are greater than their 
carrying value and, if not, an impairment provision is recorded. 
There is a risk that a client relationship intangible was impaired 
but the group did not record an impairment provision because 
the impairment trigger remained undetected. 
Our response  
In this area our procedures included:  
Accounting application in relation to recognition of client relationship 
intangibles 
— Methodology implementation: we considered whether the 
payments capitalised fell within the relevant 12 month period 
by comparing the dates of client transfer and employment 
contract of the investment manager.  
— Tests of details: in respect of those instances where payments 
were capitalised beyond the 12 month period, for each 
significant addition we confirmed whether these relationships 
were held by the investment manager in a previous 
employment, challenged the group on the nature of the 
relationship and obtained documentary evidence. 
— Independent re-performance: we performed a recalculation of 
new client relationship intangibles recognised in the year and 
assessed whether the amounts capita lised were in line with the 
contractual agreements with the investment manager.  
— Tests of details: on a sample basis we tested that such costs 
related to relationships already held by the investment 
manager by obtaining relevant documentation evidencing 
previous relationship.  
Accounting application in relation to impairment of client relationship 
intangibles 
— Independent re-performance: for the element of the client 
relationship intangibles previously capitalised under IFRS 3 
Business Combinations we have critically assessed the group’s 
own review of the client relationship intangibles against 
impairment triggers. 
— Tests of details: in considering the adequacy of the impairment 
assessment performed by the group to support the carrying 
value of client relationship intangibles previously capitalised, 
we assessed the population for cl osed client accounts or non-
income generating clients to assess whether they were 
appropriately derecognised. 
Assessing transparency: we have also considered the adequacy of 
the group’s disclosure in respect of intangible assets. 
Our results – we found the recognition and carrying value of client 
relationship intangibles to be acceptable.  
Valuation of defined benefit pension deficit 
£15,600,000 (2016: £39,455,000)  
Refer to page 73 (audit committee report), page 125 (accounting 
policy) and pages 126, 143 to 148 (financial disclosures). 
The risk – subjective valuation 
The group and parent company has recognised a pension deficit 
of £15.6 million as at 31 December 2017.  
— The valuation of the defined benefit pension deficit depends 
on a number of judgemental assumptions and estimates, 
including: the discount rate used to calculate the current value 
of the future payments the group expects to pay pensioners, 
the rate of inflation that must be incorporated in the estimate of 
the future pension payments, the life expectancy of pension 
scheme members and the number of members who will 
transfer out of the schemes. The valuation is an important 
judgement as this balance is volatile and impacts the parent 
company’s distributable reserves.  
Uncertainty arises as a result of estimates made in respect of 
long term trends and market conditions to determine the value 
based on the group’s expectations of the future. As a result, the 
actual surplus or deficit realised by the group may be 
significantly different to that recognised on the balance sheet 
since small changes to the assumptions used in the calculation 
materially affect the valuation.

2 Key audit matters: our assessment  
of risks of material misstatement 
continued 
— The plan assets are not subject to significant risk of 
misstatement, but due to their ma teriality in the context of the 
group’s financial statements, they are considered to be part of 
this key audit matter. 
Our response – our procedures include: 
— Our actuarial expertise: we used our own actuarial specialists 
to challenge key assumptions and estimates used in the 
calculation of the pension deficit. The key assumptions and 
estimates we tested included the number of members who 
transfer out of the schemes, the discount rate, RPI inflation and 
life expectancy that were applied to the valuation.  
— Benchmarking assumptions: we performed a comparison of 
key assumptions against externally derived data and our 
benchmark ranges for similar schemes. 
— Methodology choice: we considered the group’s judgement in 
selecting its assumptions and whether there were any 
indicators of management bias. 
— Comparing valuations: we obtained a breakdown of assets held 
in both defined benefit pension schemes. We used our own 
valuation specialists to independently verify the value of a 
sample of the assets held within both schemes.  
— Assessing transparency: we considered the adequacy of the 
group’s disclosure in respect of the defined benefit pension 
deficit and the assumptions used which is set out in note 27 to 
the financial statements.  
Our results – we found the valuation of defined benefit pension 
deficit to be acceptable.  
(New) Measurement of Onerous Lease Provision 
£11,478,000 (2016: nil)  
Risk vs 2016:  
Refer to page 73 (audit committee report), page 131 (accounting 
policy) and pages 126 and 141 to 142 (financial disclosures). 
The risk – subjective estimate 
The measurement of the onerous lease provision depends on a 
number of assumptions and estimates. In particular, the value of 
the provision is sensitive to the underlying key assumptions 
around future cash flows and discount rates. The key assumptions 
applied by the group are: 
— the discount rates applied; 
— the estimated period of time the property remains empty  
(‘void period’); 
— the period of time a rent-free agreement is offered (‘rent-free 
period’); and 
— the level of sub-lease income and the adjustment made in 
relation to the risk of uncertainty. 
In determining the provision, the group obtained advice from 
independent property specialists. These are estimates made in 
respect of current market trends and conditions, and the value of 
the provision is determined by the group’s known future costs for 
the premises and expectations of the potential rental income.  
Our response – our procedures included: 
— Our property valuation expertise: we used our own property 
specialists to challenge key assumptions and estimates used in 
the calculation of the onerous lease provision. This included 
comparing these assumptions against our specialist’s own 
knowledge of property lettings in the industry, and assessing 
the reasonableness of the group’s assumptions against their 
benchmark ranges for similar properties in the area.  
— Test of details: we tested the accura cy and completeness of 
key data inputs by reviewing documentation in relation to 
signed lease agreements.  
— Our sector experience: we assessed the reasonability of the 
discount rate used for both certain and uncertain cash flows. 
— Methodology choice: we considered the group’s judgement in 
selecting its assumptions and whether there were any 
indicators of management bias. 
— Assessing transparency: we considered the adequacy of the 
group’s disclosure in respect of the onerous lease provision.  
Our results – we found the measurem ent of the onerous lease 
provision to be acceptable.

3 Our application of materiality and an 
overview of the scope of our audit 
Materiality for the group financial statements as a whole was set at 
£3.6 million (2016: £2.8 million), determined with reference to a 
benchmark of group profit before tax, normalised to exclude the 
loss on recognition of the onerous lease for the year of £16.1 million 
(as disclosed in note 25) and the credit of £2.0 million in relation to 
the rent-free accrual (as disclosed in note 9), a credit of £5.5 million 
relating to the plan amendment gain for the defined benefit 
pension scheme (as disclosed in note 27), as well as expense of 
£4.9 million relating to an aborted acquisition during the year  
(as disclosed in note 8). These are one-off expenses and not 
considered to be part of the normalised profit before tax. 
Materiality represents 5% (2016: 5%) of the normalised group  
profit before tax. 
Materiality for the parent company financial statements as a 
whole was set at £2.9 million (2016: £2.2 million). This is lower than 
the materiality we would otherwise have determined by reference 
to net assets, and represents 1.4% of the parent company’s net 
assets (2016: 1.2%).  
We agreed to report to the audit committee any corrected or 
uncorrected identified misstatements exceeding £180,000  
(2016: £140,000), in addition to other identified misstatements that 
warranted reporting on qualitative grounds. 
Of the group's eight (2016: eight) reporting components, we 
subjected eight (2016: eight) to full scope audits for group 
purposes. The audit work for eigh t (2016: six) was performed by 
the group team to materiality levels set individually for each entity 
which ranged from £0.03 million to £2.9 million (2016: £0.2 million 
to £2.2 million), having regard to the mix of size and risk profile of 
the group across the components. 
The group team performed proced ures on the items excluded 
from normalised group profit before tax.  
The components scoped in for group reporting purposes 
accounted for 100% of total group revenue, group profit before tax 
and total group assets. 
4 We have nothing to report on going 
concern  
We are required to report to you if: 
— we have anything material to add or draw attention to in 
relation to the directors’ statement on page 121 of the financial 
statements on the use of the go ing concern basis of accounting 
with no material uncertainties that may cast significant doubt 
over the group and company’s use of that basis for a period of 
at least twelve months from the date of approval of the 
financial statements; or  
— the same statement under the List ing Rules set out on page 105 
is materially inconsistent with our audit knowledge.  
We have nothing to report in these respects.  
5 We have nothing to report on the 
other information in the Annual 
Report and Accounts  
The directors are responsible for the other information presented 
in the annual report together with the financial statements. Our 
opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other 
information and, accordingly, we do not express an audit opinion 
or, except as explicitly stated below, any form of assurance 
conclusion thereon.  
Our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, 
consider whether, based on our financial statements audit work, 
the information therein is materi ally misstated or inconsistent 
with the financial statements or our audit knowledge. Based solely 
on that work we have not identified material misstatements in the 
other information.  
Strategic report and directors’ report  
Based solely on our work on the other information:  
— we have not identified material misstatements in the strategic 
report and the directors’ report;

Disclosures of principal risks and longer-term viability  
Based on the knowledge we acquired during our financial 
statements audit, we have noth ing material to add or draw 
attention to in relation to:  
— the directors’ confirmation wi thin viability statement on  
page 28 that they have carried out a robust assessment of the 
principal risks facing the group, including those that would 
threaten its business model, future performance, solvency  
and liquidity;  
— the risk management disclosure s describing these risks and 
explaining how they are being managed and mitigated; and  
— the directors’ explanation in the viability statement of how  
they have assessed the prospects of the group, over what 
period they have done so and why they considered that  
period to be appropriate, and their statement as to whether 
they have a reasonable expectat ion that the group will be  
able to continue in operation and meet its liabilities as they  
fall due over the period of their assessment, including any 
related disclosures drawing attention to any necessary 
qualifications or assumptions.  
Under the Listing Rules we are required to review the viability 
statement. We have nothing to report in this respect.  
Corporate governance disclosures  
We are required to report to you if:  
— we have identified material inconsistencies between the 
knowledge we acquired during our financial statements audit 
and the directors’ statement that they consider that the annual 
report and financial statements taken as a whole is fair, 
balanced and understandable and provides the information 
necessary for shareholders to a ssess the group’s position and 
performance, business model and strategy; or  
— the section of the annual report describing the work of the 
audit committee does not a ppropriately address matters 
communicated by us to the audit committee. 
We are required to report to you if the corporate governance 
report does not properly disclo se a departure from the eleven 
provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code specified by  
the Listing Rules for our review.  
We have nothing to report in these respects.  
 
6 We have nothing to report on the 
other matters on which we are 
required to report by exception  
Under the Companies Act 2006, we are required to report to you if, 
in our opinion:  
— adequate accounting records have not been kept by the parent 
company, or returns adequate for our audit have not been 
received from branches not visited by us; or  
— the parent company financial statements and the part of the 
directors’ remuneration report to be audited are not in 
agreement with the accounting records and returns; or  
— certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration specified by law 
are not made; or  
— we have not received all the in formation and explanations we 
require for our audit.  
We have nothing to report in these respects.  
7 Respective responsibilities  
Directors’ responsibilities  
As explained more fully in their statement set out on page 106,  
the directors are responsible for: the preparation of the financial 
statements including being satisfied that they give a true and fair 
view; such internal control as they determine is necessary to 
enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from 
material misstatement, whether du e to fraud or error; assessing 
the group and parent company’s ability to continue as a going 
concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern; 
and using the going concern basis of accounting unless they either 
intend to liquidate the group or the parent company or to cease 
operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.  
  
112 Rathbone Brothers Plc Report and accounts 2017  
  Rathbone Brothers Plc Report and accounts 2017 113 
Auditor’s responsibilities 
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether 
the financial statements as a whole are free from material 
misstatement, whether due to fraud, other irregularities, or error, 
and to issue our opinion in an auditor’s report. Reasonable 
assurance is a high level of assura nce, but does no t guarantee that 
an audit conducted in accordance wi th ISAs (UK) will always detect 
a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise 
from fraud, other irregularities or error and are considered material 
if, individually or in aggregate, they could r easonably be expected  
to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis  
of the financial statements. The ri sk of not detecting a material 
misstatement resulting from fraud or other irregularities is higher 
than for one resulting from error, as they may involve collusion, 
forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override 
of internal control and may involve any area of law and regulation 
not just those directly affecting the financial statements. 
A fuller description of our responsibilities is provided on the FRC’s 
website at www.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities.  
Irregularities – ability to detect 
We identified relevant areas of laws and regulations that could 
have a material effect on the fina ncial statements from our sector 
experience, through discussion with the directors and other 
management (as required by auditing standards), and from 
inspection of the group’s regulatory correspondence. 
We had regard to laws and regulations in areas that directly affect 
the financial statements including financial reporting (including 
related company legislation) and taxation legislation. We 
considered the extent of compliance with those laws and 
regulations as part of our procedures on the related financial 
statements items.  
In addition we considered the impact of laws and regulations in 
the specific areas of regulatory capital and liquidity, conduct, 
financial crime including money laundering, sanctions list and 
market abuse regulations recognising the financial and regulated 
nature of the group’s activities. With the exception of any known 
or possible non-compliance, an d as required by auditing 
standards, our work in respect of these was limited to enquiry of 
the directors and other management and inspection of regulatory 
correspondence. We considered the effect of any known or 
possible non-compliance in these ar eas as part of our procedures 
on the related financial statements items.  
We communicated identified laws and regulations throughout our 
team and remained alert to an y indications of non-compliance 
throughout the audit.  
As with any audit, there remained a higher risk of non-detection of 
irregularities, as these may involv e collusion, forgery, intentional 
omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal controls.  
8 The purpose of our audit work and to 
whom we owe our responsibilities  
This report is made solely to the company’s members, as a body, 
in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 
2006. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state 
to the company’s members those matters we are required to state 
to them in an auditor’s report and for no other purpose. To the 
fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume 
responsibility to anyone ot her than the co mpany and the 
company’s members, as a body, for our audit work, for this report, 
or for the opinions we have formed.

Consolidated financial 
statements Notes to the consolidated financial statements 
118 Rathbone Brothers Plc Report and accounts 2017 
1 Principal accounting policies 
Rathbone Brothers Plc (‘the company’) is a public company 
incorporated and domiciled in England and Wales under the 
Companies Act 2006. 
1.1 Basis of preparation 
The consolidated and company financial statements have been 
prepared in accordance with In ternational Financial Reporting 
Standards (IFRS) as adopted by the EU. The company financial 
statements are presented on pages 114 to 117.  
The financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost 
basis, except for certain financial instruments that are measured at 
fair value (notes 1.12 and 1.16). The principal accounting policies 
adopted are set out in this note and, unless otherwise stated, have 
been applied consistently to all periods presented in the 
consolidated financial statements. 
1.2 Basis of consolidation 
The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial 
statements of the company and entities controlled by the 
company (its subsidiaries), together ‘the group’, made up to 31 
December each year. 
The group controls an entity when it is exposed to, or has rights to, 
variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the 
ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity. 
Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date on which control 
is obtained, and no longer consolidated from the date that control 
ceases; their results are included in the consolidated financial 
statements up to the date that control ceases. Intercompany 
transactions and balances between group companies are 
eliminated on consolidation. 
1.3 Developments in reporting standards 
and interpretations  
Standards and interpretations affecting the reported results or the 
financial position 
In the current year, the group has adopted the amendments to IAS 
7 ‘Statement of Cash Flows’, wh ich improves disclosures on net 
debt in these financial statements. The group now provides a 
reconciliation between the opening and closing balances for 
liabilities arising from financial activities (see note 36).  
No other standards or interpretations, new or revised, have been 
adopted that have had a significant impact on the amounts 
reported in the financial statements. 
Standards not affecting the reported results or the 
financial position 
The following new and revised standards and interpretations have 
been adopted in the current year . Their adoption has not had any 
significant impact on the amounts reported in these financial 
statements but may impact the accounting for future transactions 
and arrangements: 
– Recognition of Deferred Tax Assets for Unrealised Losses 
(Amendments to IAS 12) 
Future new standards and interpretations 
A number of new standards and amendments to standards  
and interpretations will be effective for future annual periods 
beginning after 1 January 2017 and, therefore, have not been 
applied in preparing these consol idated financial statements.  
The effects of IFRS 9 ‘Financial Instruments’, IFRS 15 'Revenue 
from Contracts with Customers' and IFRS 16 ‘Leases’ on  
the consolidated financial statements of the group are  
discussed below. 
IFRS 9 'Financial Instruments'  
IFRS 9 is effective for periods commencing on or after 1 January 
2018. The standard was endorsed by the EU during 2016. The 
group has not adopted this standard in preparing these 
consolidated financial statements. 
IFRS 9 governs the accounting treatment for the classification and 
measurement of financial instruments and the timing and extent 
of credit provisioning. The standard replaces IAS 39. 
Classification of financial assets 
The basis of classification for financial assets under IFRS 9 is 
different from that under IAS 39. Financial assets will be classified 
into one of three categories: amortised cost, fair value through 
profit or loss (FVTPL) or fair value through other comprehensive 
income (FVOCI). The held to maturity, loans and receivables  
and available for sale categories available under IAS 39 have  
been removed. 
The classification criteria for allocating financial assets between 
categories under IFRS 9 requir es the group to document the 
business models under which its assets are managed, 
distinguishing whether they are: 
– held-to-collect; 
– both held-to-collect and for sale; or 
– another type of business model (e.g. trading). 
The group is also required to review contractual terms and 
conditions to determine whether the cash flows arising on these 
assets are solely payments of principal and interest. 
  
118 Rathbone Brothers Plc Report and accounts 2017  
rathbones.com 119 
The group has not iden tified any material differences from the 
classification of financial assets under the new standard. Debt 
securities currently classified as held to maturity will be classified 
as amortised cost. Other assets cu rrently carried at amortised cost 
such as cash with central banks (including deposits held with the 
Bank of England) and loans and advances to banks and customers 
will also continue to be classified as such. Investments in money 
market funds, which are currently classified as available for sale, 
will be classified as FVTPL as they are equity instruments. The 
group does not intend to make the FVOCI election. Under this 
classification, fair value gains and losses will be recognised in profit 
or loss. 
Impairment of financial assets 
Under IFRS 9, an expected cred it loss (ECL) model replaces the 
incurred loss model, meaning there no longer needs to be a 
triggering event in order to reco gnise impairment losses. A credit 
loss provision must be made for the amount of any loss expected 
to arise, whereas under IAS 39, credit losses are recognised when 
they are incurred. 
Under the ECL model, a dual measurement approach applies 
whereby a financial asset will attract a loss allowance equal  
to either: 
– 12 month expected credit losses: losses resulting from possible 
defaults within the next 12 months; or 
– lifetime expected credit losses: losses resulting from possible 
defaults over the remaining life of the financial asset. 
The latter applies if there has been a significant deterioration in the 
credit quality of the asset, albeit lifetime ECLs will always be 
recognised for assets without a significant financing component. 
The group has developed a detailed model for calculating ECLs on 
its treasury book and investment management loan book. This 
requires considerable judgement in developing different 
economic scenarios and probability -weighting them accordingly. 
The economic scenarios in the model are based on the projections 
of GDP, inflation, unemployment rates, house price indices, 
financial markets and interest ra tes as set out in the banking 
system stress testing scenario published annually by the PRA. In 
addition, management prepare ‘better’ and ‘worse’ case economic 
forecasts by adjusting the projections for the economic variables. 
Under each resultant scenario, an expected credit loss is forecast 
for each exposure in the treasury book and investment 
management loan book. The expected credit loss is calculated 
based on management’s estimate of the probability of default, the 
loss given default and the exposure at default of each exposure 
taking into account industry credit loss data, the group’s own 
credit loss experience, the expected repayment profiles of the 
exposures and the level of collateral held. Industry credit loss 
information is drawn from data on credit defaults for different 
categories of exposure publishe d by the Council of Mortgage 
Lenders and Standard & Poor’s. 
The model adopts a staging allo cation methodology, primarily 
based on changes in the internal and/or external credit rating of 
exposures to identify significant increases in credit risk since 
inception of the exposure. 
The group’s trade receivables (i ncluding trust and financial 
planning debtors) are generally short term and do not contain 
significant financing components. Therefore, the group expects to 
apply a practical expedient by using a provision matrix to calculate 
lifetime expected credit losses. 
Classification of financial liabilities 
The basis of classification for financial liabilities under IFRS 9 
remains unchanged from that under IAS 39. The two categories 
are amortised cost or fair value through profit or loss (either 
designated as such or held for trading). 
The group does not curr ently designate any liab ilities as fair value 
through profit or loss, and does no t anticipate doing so. Therefore, 
under IFRS 9, the group expects to classify all financial liabilities as 
amortised cost, with no material impact on measurement. 
Transition 
In adopting IFRS 9, the group plans to take advantage of the 
exemption from having to restate comparative information, 
instead recognising any differences between the previous and the 
new carrying amounts in opening equity and reserves. 
Estimated impact of adoption of IFRS 9 
The group has assessed the estimated impact that the initial 
application of IFRS 9 will have on its consolidated financial 
statements, based on the profile of its financial instruments as at 
the balance sheet date. From the work completed to date, the 
group estimates that adoption of IFRS 9 will not result in any 
material adjustments to opening equity, or the carrying amount of 
financial assets and liabilities recognised on the balance sheet. 
Additional expected credit loss provisions recognised under IFRS 
9 are expected to be immaterial, refl ecting the high cr edit quality of 
instruments in the treasury book, the high level of security held 
against the investment management loan book and relatively low 
value of trade receivables. 
IFRS 15 'Revenue from Contracts with Customers'  
IFRS 15 is effective for periods commencing on or after 1 January 
2018 and replaces existing revenue recognition guidance, in 
particular under IAS 18. The standard was endorsed by the EU 
during 2016. The group has not ad opted this standard early in 
preparing these consolidated financial statements. 
IFRS 15 changes how and when revenue is recognised from 
contracts with customers and the treatment of the costs of 
obtaining a contract with a customer. The standard requires that 
the recognition of revenue is linked to the fulfilment of identified 
performance obligations that are enshrined in the customer 
contract. It also requires that the incremental cost of obtaining a 
customer contract should be capitalised if that cost is expected to 
be recovered.

Consolidated financial 
statements Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 
120 Rathbone Brothers Plc Report and accounts 2017 
1 Principal accounting policies 
continued 
The group has considered the impact of adopting the standard, on 
its existing revenue streams, as well as on its policy of capitalising 
the cost of obtaining customer contracts. 
Net fee and commission income 
Included within net fee and commission income are initial fees, 
charged by a number of group companies in relation to certain 
business activities. Under IFRS 15, the group is required to make an 
assessment as to whether the work performed to earn such fees 
constitutes the transfer of services and, therefore, fulfils any 
performance obligation(s). If so, then these fees can be recognised 
when the relevant performance obligation has been satisfied; if 
not, then the fees can only be reco gnised in the period the services 
are provided. 
We have not identified any inst ances where the recognition of 
revenue will change materially from the current treatment in the 
consolidated financial statements. 
Contract costs 
Under the group’s current policy for capitalising contract costs, 
incremental payments that are made to secure investment 
management contracts are capitalised as client relationship 
intangibles if they are separable, reliably measurable and expected 
to be recovered. The period during which such payments are 
capitalised is typically 12 months, as explained in note 2.1. 
Under IFRS 15, the scope requirements are broader such that costs 
to obtain any contract with a customer should be capitalised if 
those costs are incremental and the entity expects to recover them. 
The group has assessed its current policy and expects to remove 
the 12 month limit on capitalisation of payments to newly 
recruited investment managers under the new standard. The 
policy will be unchanged in all other respects. 
The group has also identified a number of other schemes where 
awards are linked to obtaining client contracts and has considered 
whether any meet the new criteria for capitalising costs under 
IFRS 15. The group does not believe that the adoption of the new 
standard will result in any awards made under these schemes 
being capitalised. 
Transition 
The group plans to adopt IFRS 15 using the cumulative effect 
method, with the effect of initially applying the standard 
recognised at the date of initial ap plication, with no restatement of 
the comparative period. 
Estimated impact of adoption of IFRS 15 
The group has assessed the estimated impact that the initial 
application of IFRS 15 will have on its consolidated financial 
statements. 
From the work completed to date, the group estimates that it will 
recognise a pre-tax adjustment of approximately £8 million to 
opening equity, with a correspo nding adjustment to client 
relationship intangibles, in respec t of the additional capitalisation 
of payments made to investment managers. 
IFRS 16 'Leases' 
IFRS 16 is effective for periods commencing on or after 1 January 
2019. The standard was endorsed by the EU during 2017. The 
group has not adopted this standard early. 
IFRS 16 eliminates the classificati on of leases as either operating 
leases or finance leases. The group will be required to recognise all 
leases with a term of more than 12 months as a right-of-use lease 
asset on its balance sheet; the grou p will also recognise a financial 
liability representing its obligation to make future lease payments. 
Transition 
Definition of a lease 
On transition to IFRS 16, the group can choose whether to:  
– apply the new definition of a lease to all its contracts as if  
IFRS 16 had always applied; or  
– apply a practical expedient and retain its previous assessments 
of which contracts contain a lease.  
The group intends to apply the practical expedient and therefore 
will not be reassessing those contracts that are not deemed to 
contain a lease prior to the date of adoption. 
Retrospective approach 
As a lessee, the group can either apply the standard using a: 
– retrospective approach; or  
– modified retrospective approach with optional 
practical expedients.  
The group has assessed the impact of both approaches in relation 
to its existing lease contracts, and plans to apply the modified 
retrospective approach. 
Potential impact 
The group has conducted an initial quantification of the impact 
of adopting the standard, based on its existing lease contracts.  
The group’s total assets and total liabilities will be increased by 
the recognition of lease assets an d liabilities. The lease assets will 
be depreciated over the shorter of the expected life of the asset 
and the lease term. The lease liability will be reduced by lease 
payments, offset by the unwinding of the liability over the 
lease term. 
  
120 Rathbone Brothers Plc Report and accounts 2017  
rathbones.com 121 
The most significant impact is in respect of its London head office 
premises. As at 31 December 2017, the group’s future minimum 
lease payments under non-cancella ble operating leases amounted 
to £90,602,000, on an undiscounted basis, of which £75,946,000 
relates to its 8 Finsbury Circus office (see note 33). 
On the group’s statement of comprehensive income, the profile of 
lease costs will be front-loaded, at least individually, as the interest 
charge is higher in the early years of a lease term as the discount 
rate unwinds. The total cost of the lease over the lease term is 
expected to be unchanged. 
In addition to the above impacts, recognition of lease assets will 
increase the group’s regulatory capital requirement. 
Lessor accounting 
The group is not required to make any adjustments for leases in 
which it is a lessor except where it is an intermediate lessor in a 
sub-lease. The work to quantify the impact of being an 
intermediate lessor remains ongoing.  
1.4 Business combinations 
Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition 
method. The consideration for each acquisition is measured at 
the aggregate of the fair values (at the date of exchange) of 
assets given, liabilities incurred or assumed and equity 
instruments issued by the group in exchange for control of the 
acquiree. Acquisition-related costs are recognised in profit or 
loss as incurred. 
Where applicable, the consideration for the acquisition includes 
any asset or liability resulting from a contingent consideration 
arrangement, measured at its acquisition date fair value. 
Subsequent changes in such fair values may arise as a result of 
additional information obtained after this date about facts and 
circumstances that existed at the acquisition date. Provided they 
arise within 12 months of the acquisition date, these changes are 
measurement period adjustments and are reflected against the 
cost of acquisition. Changes in the fair value of contingent 
consideration resulting from events occurring after the acquisition 
date are charged to profit or lo ss or other comprehensive income, 
except for obligations that are classified as equity, which are not 
remeasured. Such changes are irresp ective of the 12 month period 
from acquisition. 
1.5 Going concern 
The directors have, at the time of approving the financial 
statements, a reasonable expectation that the company and the 
group have adequate resources to continue in operational 
existence. In forming this view, the directors have considered the 
company’s and the group’s prospe cts for a period exceeding 12 
months. Thus they continue to adopt the going concern basis of 
accounting in preparing the financial statements. 
1.6 Foreign currencies 
The functional and presentational currency of the company and 
its subsidiaries is sterling.  
Transactions in currencies other than the relevant group entity’s 
functional currency are recorded at the rates of exchange 
prevailing on the dates of the transactions. At each balance sheet 
date, monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in 
foreign currencies are retranslated at the rates prevailing on the 
balance sheet date. Gains and losses arising on retranslation are 
included in profit or loss for the year. 
1.7 Income 
Net interest income 
Interest income or expense from interest-bearing financial 
instruments, except those classi fied as held for trading, is 
calculated using the effective interest method and recognised 
within net interest income. Dividends received from money 
market funds are included in net interest income when received. 
The effective interest method is the method of calculating the 
amortised cost of a financial asset or liability (or group of assets 
and liabilities) and of allocating the interest income or interest 
expense over the relevant period. The effective interest rate is the 
rate that exactly discounts the expected future cash payments or 
receipts through the expected life of the financial instrument, or 
when appropriate, a shorter period, to the net carrying amount of 
the instrument. The application of the method has the effect of 
recognising income (or expense) receivable (or payable) on the 
instrument evenly in proportion to the amount outstanding over 
the period to maturity or repayment. In calculating effective 
interest, the group estimates cash flows considering all contractual 
terms of the financial instrument but excluding the impact of 
future credit losses. 
Net fee and commission income 
Portfolio or investment management fees, commissions 
receivable or payable and fees from advisory services are 
recognised on a continuous basis over the period that the related 
service is provided. 
Commission charges for executing transactions on behalf of 
clients are recognised when the transaction is dealt.  
Initial charges receivable from the sale of unit holdings in the 
group’s collective investment schemes and related rebates are 
recognised at the point of sale. 
Dividend income 
Dividend income from final dividends on equity securities is 
accounted for on the date the security becomes ex-dividend. 
Interim dividends are recognised when received.

1.8 Operating leases 
Lease agreements which do not transfer substantially all of the 
risks and rewards of ownership of the leased assets to the group 
are classified as operating leases. Payments made under operating 
leases are recognised in profit or loss on a straight line basis over 
the term of the lease. The impact of any lease incentives is spread 
over the term of the lease. 
1.9 Share-based payments 
The group engages in equity-settl ed and cash-settled share-based 
payment transactions in respect of services received from  
its employees.  
Equity-settled awards 
For equity-settled share-based pa yments, the fair value of the 
award is measured by reference to the fair value of the shares or 
share options granted on the grant date. The cost of the employee 
services received in respect of th e shares or share options granted 
is recognised in profit or loss over the vesting period, with a 
corresponding credit to equity. 
The fair value of the awards or options granted is determined 
using a binomial pricing model, which takes into account the 
current share price, the risk-free interest rate, the expected 
volatility of the company’s share price over the life of the option or 
award, any applicable exercise pr ice and other relevant factors. 
Only those vesting conditions that include terms related to market 
conditions are taken into account in estimating fair value. Non-
market vesting conditions are taken into account by adjusting the 
number of shares or share options included in the measurement 
of the cost of employee services so that, ultimately, the amount 
recognised in profit or loss reflec ts the number of vested shares or 
share options, with a corresponding adjustment to equity. Where 
vesting conditions are related to market conditions, the charges for 
the services received are recognised regardless of whether or not 
the market-related vesting condition is met, provided that any 
non-market vesting conditions are also met. Shares purchased and 
issued are charged directly to equity. 
Cash-settled awards 
For cash-settled share-based paymen ts, a liability is recognised for 
the services received to the balance sheet date, measured at the 
fair value of the liability. At each subsequent balance sheet date 
and at the date on which the liability is settled, the fair value of the 
liability is remeasured with any changes in fair value recognised in 
profit or loss. 
1.10 Taxation 
Current tax 
Current tax is the expected tax payable or receivable on net 
taxable income for the year. Current tax is calculated using tax 
rates enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date, 
together with any adjustment to tax payable or receivable in 
respect of previous years. 
Deferred tax 
Deferred tax is accounted for under the balance sheet liability 
method in respect of temporary differences using tax rates (and 
laws) that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the 
balance sheet date and are expected to apply when the liability is 
settled or when the asset is realised. Deferred tax liabilities are 
recognised for all temporary differences and deferred tax assets 
are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits 
will be available against which deductible temporary differences 
may be utilised, except where the temporary difference arises: 
– from the initial recognition of goodwill;  
– from the initial recognition of other assets and liabilities in a 
transaction, which affects neither the tax profit nor the 
accounting profit, other than in a business combination; or 
– in relation to investments in subsidiaries and associates, where 
the group is able to control the reversal of the temporary 
difference and it is the group’s intention not to reverse the 
temporary difference in the foreseeable future. 
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when they relate to 
income taxes levied by the same taxation authority and the group 
intends to settle its current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis. 
1.11 Cash and cash equivalents 
Cash comprises cash in hand. 
Cash equivalents comprise mo ney market funds which are 
realisable on demand and loans and advances to banks with a 
maturity of less than three months from the date of acquisition. 
For the purposes of the consolidated statement of cash flows, cash 
and cash equivalents consist of cash and cash equivalents as 
defined above, net of outstanding bank overdrafts. 
1.12 Financial assets 
Initial recognition  
Financial assets are initially recognised at fair value. 
Classification and subsequent valuation 
Financial assets are classified in the following categories: 
– at fair value through profit or loss 
Financial instruments are classified in this category if they are 
held for trading, or if they are designated in this category by the 
group. Financial assets held at fair value through profit or loss 
are carried at fair value, with gains and losses arising from 
changes in fair value taken directly to profit or loss. 
122 Rathbone Brothers Plc Report and accounts 2017  
rathbones.com 123 
– Loans and receivables 
Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with 
fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an 
active market. They arise when the group provides money, 
goods or services to a debtor or purchases a loan or other 
debtor with no intention of trading the receivable. Loans and 
receivables are measured at amortised cost using the effective 
interest method (note 1.7), less any impairment. 
If the fair value of the loan on initial recognition is lower than 
the amount advanced, the shortfall is charged to profit or loss. 
– Held to maturity 
Held to maturity investments are non-derivative financial 
assets with fixed or determinable payments and fixed 
maturities (other than those that meet the definition of loans 
and receivables or that the group has classified as available for 
sale or fair value through profit or loss) that the group has the 
positive intention and ability to hold to maturity. Held to 
maturity investments are measur ed at amortised cost using 
the effective interest method (note 1.7), less any impairment. 
– Available for sale 
Available for sale financial assets are non-derivative 
financial assets that are either designated in this category or 
not classified in any of the other categories. Available for sale 
investments are those intended to be held for an indefinite 
period of time, and which may be sold in response to needs 
for liquidity or changes in inte rest rates, exchange rates or 
equity prices.  
Available for sale financial assets are subsequently carried at 
fair value. Gains and losses arising from changes in the fair 
value of available for sale financial assets are recognised in 
other comprehensive income and presented in the available 
for sale reserve in equity. When the financial asset is sold, 
derecognised or impaired, the cumulative gain or loss 
previously recognised in equity is recycled to profit or loss. 
Trade date accounting 
Financial assets, excluding loans and receivables, are recognised 
on trade date, being the date on which the group commits to 
purchase the asset. Loans and receivables are recognised when 
cash is advanced to the borrowers. 
Financial assets are derecognised when the rights to receive cash 
flows have expired or the group has transferred substantially all 
the risks and rewards of ownership. 
Fair value measurement 
The fair values of quoted financial instruments in active markets 
are based on current bid prices. If an active market for a financial 
asset does not exist, the group establishes fair value by using 
valuation techniques. These include the use of recent arm’s  
length transactions, discounted cash flow analysis, option pricing 
models and other valuation techniques commonly used by 
market participants. 
The group recognises transfers between levels of the fair value 
hierarchy at the end of the reporting period during which the 
change has occurred. 
Impairment of financial assets 
– Financial assets carried at amortised cost 
If there is objective evidence that a financial asset carried at 
amortised cost, or a group of such financial assets, has suffered 
an impairment loss, the recovera ble amount of the asset, or 
group of assets, is estimated in order to determine the extent of 
the impairment loss. The group measures the amount of the 
impairment loss as the diff erence between the carrying 
amount of the asset, or group of assets, and the present value of 
estimated future cash flows from the asset, or group of assets, 
discounted at the effective interest rate of the asset, or group of 
assets, at initial recognition. The present value of estimated 
future cash flows excludes the impact of future credit losses 
that have not been incurred. Any impairment loss is 
recognised in profit or loss. 
All impairment losses are reviewed at least at each reporting 
date. If subsequently the amount of the loss decreases as a 
result of a new event, the relevant element of the outstanding 
impairment loss is reversed through profit or loss. 
Interest on impaired financial assets is recognised at the 
original effective interest rate applied to the carrying amount as 
reduced by an allowance for impairment. 
– Financial assets carried at fair value 
When a decline in the fair value of a financial asset classified as 
available for sale has been recognised in other comprehensive 
income and there is objective evidence that the asset is 
impaired, the cumulative loss is removed from equity and 
recognised in profit or loss. The loss is measured as the 
difference between the amortised cost of the financial asset 
and its current fair value. Impairment losses on available for 
sale equity instruments are not re versed through profit or loss, 
but those on available for sale debt instruments are reversed, if 
there is an increase in fair value that is objectively related to a 
subsequent event. 
1.13 Property, plant and equipment 
All property, plant and equipment is stated at historical cost, which 
includes directly attributable acquisition costs, less accumulated 
depreciation and impairment losses. Depreciation is charged so as 
to write off the cost of assets to their estimated residual value over 
their estimated useful lives, using the straight line method, on the 
following bases: 
– leasehold improvements:  over the lease term; and 
– plant, equipment and computer hardware: over three to 
10 years. 
The assets’ residual lives are reviewed, and adjusted if appropriate, 
at each balance sheet date. Gains and losses on disposals are 
determined by comparing proceeds with the carrying amount  
and these are included in profit or loss.

continued 
1.14 Intangible assets 
Goodwill 
Goodwill arises through business combinations and represents 
the excess of the cost of acquisition over the group’s interest in the 
fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent 
liabilities of a business at the date of acquisition.  
Goodwill is recognised as an asse t and is allocated to groups of 
cash generating units. Cash generating units are identified as the 
smallest identifiable group of a ssets that generates cash inflows 
that are largely independent of the cash inflows from other assets 
or groups of assets. 
On disposal of a subsidiary the attributed amount of goodwill that 
has not been subject to impa irment is included in the 
determination of the profit or loss on disposal. 
Goodwill arising on acquisitions before 1 January 2004, being 
the date of the group’s transition to IFRS, has been retained at 
the previous UK GAAP carrying amounts and is tested for 
impairment annually. 
Client relationships 
Client relationships acquired as part of a business combination are 
initially recognised at fair value (note 1.4). Determining whether a 
transaction that involves the purchase of client relationships is 
treated as a business combinatio n or a separate purchase of 
intangible assets requires judgement. The factors that the group 
takes into consideration in making this judgement are set out in 
note 2.1. 
Individually purchased client relationships are initially recognised 
at cost. Where a transaction to acquire client relationship 
intangibles includes an element of variable deferred consideration, 
an estimate is made of the value of consideration that will 
ultimately be paid. The client relationship intangible recognised on 
the balance sheet is adjusted for any subsequent change in the 
value of deferred consideration. Note 2.1 sets out the approach 
taken by the group where judgement is required to determine 
whether payments made for the introduction of client 
relationships should be capitalised as intangible assets or charged 
to profit or loss. 
Client relationships are subsequently carried at the amount 
initially recognised less accumulated amortisation, which is 
calculated using the straight line method over their estimated 
useful lives (normally 10 to 15 years, but not more than 15 years).  
Computer software and software development costs 
Costs incurred to acquire and bring to use computer software 
licences are capitalised and amortised through profit or loss over 
their expected useful live s (three to four years). 
Costs that are directly associated with the production of 
identifiable and unique software products controlled by the group 
are recognised as intangible assets when the group is expected to 
benefit from future use of the software and the costs are reliably 
measurable. Other costs of producing software are charged to 
profit or loss as incurred. Comp uter software development costs 
recognised as assets are amortised using the straight line method 
over their useful lives (not exceeding four years).  
1.15 Impairment of goodwill and intangible assets 
At each balance sheet date, th e group reviews the carrying 
amounts of its intangible assets to determine whether there is any 
indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss. If 
any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is 
estimated in order to determine the extent of the impairment loss 
(if any). Where the asset does no t generate cash flows that are 
independent from other assets, the group estimates the 
recoverable amount of the cash generating unit to which the asset 
belongs. The recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less 
costs to sell and value-in-use. In assessing value-in-use, the 
estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value 
using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market 
assessments of the time value of money.  
Goodwill is tested for impairment at least annually. For the 
purposes of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to the 
group’s cash generating units. The carrying amount of each cash 
generating unit is compared to its value-in-use, calculated using a 
discounted cash flow method. If the recoverable amount of the 
cash generating unit is less than the carrying amount of the unit, 
the impairment loss is allocated first to reduce the carrying 
amount of the unit and then to the other assets of the unit pro-rata 
on the basis of the carrying amount of each asset in the unit. 
Client relationship intangibles are tested for impairment by 
comparing the fair value of funds under management for each 
individually acquired client relationship (or, for client relationships 
acquired with a busine ss combination, each acquired portfolio of 
clients) with their associated amortised value. An example of 
evidence of impairment would be lost client relationships. In 
determining whether a client relationship is lost, the group 
considers factors such as the level of funds withdrawn and the 
existence of other retained family relationships. When client 
relationships are lost, the full amount of unamortised cost is 
recognised immediately in profit or loss and the intangible asset 
is derecognised. 
If the recoverable amount of any asset other than client 
relationships or goodwill is estimated to be less than its carrying 
amount, the carrying amount of the asset is reduced to its 
recoverable amount. 
Any impairment loss is recognised immediately in profit or loss.

1.16 Financial liabilities  
Financial liabilities are initially recognised at fair value and 
classified as fair value through profit or loss (if designated as such 
or if held for trading) or at amortised cost. The group derecognises 
financial liabilities when its contractual obligations are discharged 
or cancelled, or expire. 
The group has not designated any liabilities as fair value through 
profit or loss and holds no liabilities as held for trading.  
Deposits and borrowings 
After initial recognition, deposits and borrowings, except deposits 
on demand, are subsequently measured at amortised cost using 
the effective interest rate method through net interest income 
(note 1.8). Amortised cost is calculated by taking into account any 
issue costs and any discounts or premiums on settlement. 
Deposits on demand continue to be held at face value. 
1.17 Provisions and contingent liabilities 
Provisions are recognised when the group has a present obligation 
(legal or constructive) as a result of a past event and it is probable 
that an outflow of economic benefits, that can be reliably 
estimated, will occur. Provisions are measured at the present value 
of the expenditures expected to be required to settle the 
obligation, discounted using a pre-tax rate that reflects current 
market assessments of the time value of money and the risks 
specific to the obligation. 
Contingent liabilities are possible obligations that depend on the 
outcome of uncertain future events or those present obligations 
where the outflows of resources are uncertain or cannot be 
measured reliably. Contingent liabilities are not recognised in the 
financial statements but are disclosed unless the likelihood of 
crystallisation is judged to be remote. 
1.18 Retirement benefit ob ligations on retirement 
benefit schemes 
The group’s net liability in respect of defined benefit pension plans 
is calculated separately for each plan by estimating the amount of 
future benefit that employees have earned in return for their 
service in the current and prior years; that benefit is discounted to 
determine its present value, and the fair value of any plan assets 
(at bid price) are deducted. An y asset resulting from this 
calculation is limited to the present value of available refunds and 
reductions in future contributions to the plan. 
The cost of providing benefits under defined benefit plans is 
determined using the projected unit credit method, with 
actuarial valuations being carried out at each balance sheet date. 
Net remeasurements of the defined benefit liability are 
recognised in full in the period in which they occur in other 
comprehensive income. 
Past service costs or gains are recognised immediately in the 
period of a plan amendment. 
The amount recognised in the balance sheet for death in service 
benefits represents the present va lue of the estimated obligation, 
reduced by the extent to which any future liabilities will be met by 
insurance policies. 
The company determines the net interest on the net defined 
benefit liability for the year by applying the discount rate used to 
measure the defined benefit obligati on at the beginning of the year 
to the net defined benefit liability. 
Contributions to defined contribution retirement benefit schemes 
are charged to profit or loss as an expense as they fall due. 
1.19 Segmental reporting 
The group determines and presents operating segments based on 
the information that is provided internally to the group executive 
committee, which is the group’s chief operating decision maker. 
Operating segments are organised around the services provided to 
clients; a description of the servic es provided by each segment is 
given in note 3. No operating segments have been aggregated in 
the group’s financial statements.  
Transactions between operating se gments are reported within the 
income or expenses for those segments; intra-segment income 
and expenditure is eliminated at group level. Indirect costs are 
allocated between segments in proportion to the principal cost 
driver for each category of indirect costs that is generated by 
each segment. 
1.20 Fiduciary activities 
The group commonly acts as trustee and in other fiduciary 
capacities that result in the holding or placing of assets on behalf 
of individuals, trusts, retirement benefit plans and other 
institutions. Such assets and income arising thereon are excluded 
from these financial statements, as they are not assets of the 
group. Largely as a result of cash and settlement processing, the 
group holds money on behalf of some clients in accordance with 
the Client Money Rules of the Financial Conduct Authority, the 
Jersey Financial Services Commission and the Solicitors’ Accounts 
Rules issued by the Solicitors Regulation Authority, as applicable. 
Such monies and the corresponding amounts due to clients are 
not shown on the face of the balance sheet as the group is not 
beneficially entitled to them. 
1.21 Financial guarantees 
The group provides a limited nu mber of financial guarantees, 
which are backed by assets in clients’ portfolios. Financial 
guarantees are initially recognised in the balance sheet at fair 
value. Guarantees are subsequently measured at the higher of the 
best estimate of any amount to be paid to settle the guarantee and 
the amount initially recognised less cumulative amortisation, 
which is recognised over the life of the guarantee.

2 Critical accounting judgements 
and key sources of estimation 
and uncertainty  
The group makes estimates and assumptions that affect the 
reported amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial 
year. Estimates and judgements are continually evaluated and are 
based on historical experience and other factors, including 
expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable 
under the circumstances.  
2.1 Client relationship intangibles (note 21) 
Client relationship intangibles purchased through corporate 
transactions 
When the group purchases c lient relationships through 
transactions with other corporate entities, a judgement is made as 
to whether the transaction should be accounted for as a business 
combination or as a separate purchase of intangible assets. In 
making this judgement, the group assesses the assets, liabilities, 
operations and processes that were the subject of the transaction 
against the definition of a business in IFRS 3. In particular, 
consideration is given to the scale of the operations subject to the 
transaction, whether ownership of a corporate entity has been 
acquired and to whom any amounts payable under the 
transaction are payable, among other factors. 
Payments to newly recruited investment managers 
The group assesses whether paym ents made to newly recruited 
investment managers under contractual agreements represent 
payments for the acquisition of client relationship intangibles or 
remuneration for ongoing services provided to the group. If the 
client relationships introduced are judged to be capable of being 
sold separately and th e corresponding payments are judged to be 
reliably measurable and have a high probability of recoverability 
then they are capitalised as cl ient relationship intangibles. 
Otherwise, they are judged to be in relation to the provision of 
ongoing services and are expensed in the period in which they are 
incurred. Upfront payments made to investment managers upon 
joining are expensed as they are not judged to be incremental 
costs for acquiring the client relationships. 
The group determines a suitable period during which awards 
accruing to new investment managers are capitalised. Typically, 
this will be for the period ending up to 12 months after the 
cessation of any non-compete peri od. After the defined period has 
elapsed, any payments made are charged to profit or loss. 
During the year the group capitalised £2,743,000 of payments 
made to investment managers and expensed £5,094,000  
(2016: £7,926,000 capitalised and £4,005,000 expensed).  
A reduction in the capitalisation period by one month would 
decrease client relationship inta ngibles by £281,000 and decrease 
profit before tax for the year by £281,000 (2016: £617,000 and 
£617,000 respectively). 
Amortisation of client relationship intangibles 
The group makes estimates as to th e expected duration of client 
relationships to determine the period over which related 
intangible assets are amortised. The amortisation period is 
estimated with reference to historical data on account closure 
rates and expectations for the fu ture. During the year client 
relationship intangible assets were amortised over a 10 to 15 year 
period. Amortisation of £11,433,000 (2016: £11,594,000) was 
charged during the year. A reduction in the average amortisation 
period of one year would increase the amortisation charge by 
approximately £1,076,000 (2016: £1,1 00,000). At 31 December 2017, 
the carrying value of client relationship intangibles was 
£88,511,000 (2016: £97,201,000). 
2.2 Retirement benefit obligations (note 27) 
The group makes estimates about a range of long term trends and 
market conditions to determine the value of the surplus or deficit 
on its retirement benefit sc hemes, based on the group’s 
expectations of the future and advice taken from qualified 
actuaries. Long term forecasts an d estimates are necessarily highly 
judgemental and subject to risk that actual events may be 
significantly different to those forecast. If actual events deviate 
from the assumptions made by the group then the reported 
surplus or deficit in respect of retirement benefit obligations may 
be materially different.  
The principal assumptions underlying the reported deficit of 
£15,600,000 (2016: £39,455,000 deficit) and information on the 
sensitivity of the retirement benefit obligations to changes in 
underlying estimates are set out in note 27. 
2.3 Head office relocation (notes 9 and 25) 
During the year, the group moved its head office to 8 Finsbury 
Circus, vacating 1 Curzon Street but retaining lease commitments 
until September 2023. This triggered recognition of a provision for 
the net cost of the surplus property at 1 Curzon Street until the end 
of the existing leases. 
The value of the onerous lease provision is dependent on 
assumptions about the amount and timing of the cash flows to be 
received under any sublet agreement or assignment of the leases. 
During the year, the group recognised an onerous lease provision, 
including the effect of discounting, of £16,265,000 (2016: £nil).  
At 31 December 2017, the outstanding provision stood at 
£11,478,000. Allowing for alte rnative assumptions about the 
duration of any void period, any rent-free periods offered and  
any discount on the passing rent, the onerous lease provision  
at 31 December 2017 could reasonably fall within the range of 
£7,600,000 to £15,100,000.

3 Segmental information 
For management purposes, the group is organised into two operating divisions: Investment Management and Unit Trusts. Centrally 
incurred indirect expenses are allocated to these operating segments on the basis of the cost drivers that generate the expenditure; 
principally, the headcount of staff directly involved in providing those services from which the segment earns revenues, the value of 
funds under management and the segment's total revenue. The allocati on of these costs is shown in a separate column in the tabl e 
below, alongside the information presented for internal reporting to the group executive committee, which is the group’s chief operating 
decision maker.

9 Head office relocation 
On 6 January 2016, the group exchanged contracts for five 17-year leases for a total of 75,000 sq ft of office space at 8 Finsbury Circus.  
The group began recognising costs relating to rent and dilapidation s on the new premises from the date the leases began, 13 May 2016. 
The move to the 8 Finsbury Circus office concluded on 13 February 2017, which triggered recognition of a provision for the net cost of the 
surplus property at 1 Curzon Street until the end of the existing lease (see note 25). 
During the year ended 31 December 2017, incremental costs of £16,248,000 (2016: £7,031,000) were incurred as a result of the de cision to 
move the head office to 8 Finsbury Circus . These incremental costs were as follows:

The recoverable amounts of the CGUs to which goodwill is allocated are assessed using value-in-use calculations. The group prep ares cash 
flow forecasts derived from the most recent financial budgets approved by the board, covering the forthcoming and future years. The key 
assumptions underlying the budgets are that organic growth rates, revenue margins and profit margins are in line with recent hi storical 
rates and equity markets will not change significantly in the fo rthcoming year. Budgets are extrapolated for up to 10 years bas ed on annual 
revenue growth for each CGU (see table below); as well as the group's expectation of fu ture industry growth rates. A 10 year ex trapolation 
period is chosen based on the group's assess ment of the likely associated duration of client relationships. The group estimates discount 
rates using pre-tax rates that reflect current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the CGUs . 
The pre-tax rate used to discount the forecast cash flows for each CGU is shown in the table below; these are based on a risk-a djusted 
weighted average cost of capital. The grou p judges that these discount rates appropri ately reflect the markets in which the CGU s operate 
and, in particular, the relatively small size of the trust and tax CGU. 
  Investment Management Trust and tax Rooper & Whately
At 31 December 2017 2016 2017 2016 2017 2016 
Discount rate 11.1% 9.3% 13.1% 11.3% 11.1% 9.3% 
Annual revenue growth rate 5.0% 4.0% (1.0)% (1.0)% 0.0% 0.0% 
At 30 June 2017, the group recognised an impairment charge of £283,000 in relation to goodwill allocated to the trust and tax CGU.  
An impairment was recognised, as the recove rable amount of the CGU at 30 June 2017 was £864,000, which was lower than the carry ing 
value of £1,147,000 at 31 December 2016. The recoverable amount was calculated based on forecast earnings for 2017, extrapolate d over  
10 years based on a decrease in revenues of 1.0% per annum. The pre-tax rate used to discount the forecast cash flows was 14.0%. The 
impairment was recognised in the Investment Management segment in the segmental analysis. No further impairment was recognised at 
31 December 2017. 
Based on the assumptions in the table above, the calculated recoverable amount of the trust and tax CGU at 31 December 2017 was 
£1,181,000; this was higher than its carrying value of £864,000. Reducing the assumed growth rate for income in the trust and t ax CGU by 
one percentage point would reduce the calculated recoverable amount of the CGU to £828,000. No reasonably foreseeable changes t o the 
assumptions used in the value-in-use calcul ation for the investment management CGU would result in an impairment of the goodwill 
allocated to it.

Purchases of client relationships in the year relate to payments made to investment managers and third parties for the introduc tion of 
client relationships. 
The total amount charged to profit or loss in the year, in relation to goodwill and client relationships, was £11,716,000 (2016 : £11,735,000).  
A further £5,094,000 (2016: £4,005,000) was expensed as staff costs during the year, representing amounts due for client relationships 
introduced more than 12 months after the cessation of non-compete periods (note 2.1). 
Purchased software with a cost of £18,069,000 (2016: £14,117,000) has been fully amortised but is still in use. 
22 Deposits by banks 
On 31 December 2017, deposits by banks included overnight ca sh book overdraft balances of £1,338,000 (2016: £294,000). 
The fair value of deposits by banks was not materially different to their carrying value. Fair value has been calculated as the discounted 
amount of estimated future cash flows expect ed to be paid using current market rates.

Deferred, variable costs to acquire client relationship intangibles 
Deferred, variable costs to acquire client relationship intangible s of £2,743,000 arose during the year, in relation to deferre d payments to 
investment managers and third parties linked to the value of clie nt funds introduced (2016: £7,8 20,000). These amounts have bee n 
capitalised (see note 21). 
Deferred and contingent consideration in business combinations 
Deferred and contingent consideration of £1,220,000 (2016: £1,136,000) is the present value of amounts payable at the end of 20 19 in 
respect of the acquisition of Vision Independent Financial Planning and Castle Investment Solutions. 
Legal and compensation 
During the ordinary course of business the group may, from time-to-time, be subject to complaints, as well as threatened and ac tual legal 
proceedings (which may include lawsuits brought on behalf of clients or other third parties) both in the UK and overseas. Any s uch 
material matters are periodically reassessed, with the assistance of external professional advisers where appropriate, to deter mine the 
likelihood of the group incurring a liabilit y. In those instances where it is concluded that it is more likely than not that a payment will be 
made, a provision is established to the grou p’s best estimate of the amount required to settle the obligation at the relevant b alance sheet 
date. The timing of settlement of provisions for client compensation or litigation is dependent, in part, on the duration of ne gotiations with 
third parties. 
Property-related 
Property-related provisions of £1 3,743,000 relate to dilapidation and onerous leas e provisions expected to arise on leasehold p remises held 
by the group (2016: £2,798,000 dilapidations). 
The move to the 8 Finsbury Circus office was completed on 13 February 2017, which triggered the recognition of a provision for the net 
cost of the surplus proper ty at 1 Curzon Street until the end of the existing leases. The ultimate amount of the provision is d ependent on 
the timing of any subletting or assignment arrangements and the associated terms negotiated with prospective third parties. Based on 
management's expectations of future costs for the premises and potential rental income, and timings thereof, the group recognis ed a 
provision of £16,265,000. The group utilised £4,787,000 (2016: £nil) of the onerous lease provision during the year, being the payment of 
rent, rates and service charge. 
Dilapidation provisions are calculated using a discounted cash flow model; during the year ended 31 December 2017, dilapidation 
provisions decreased by £533,000 (2016: increased £1,003,000). The group utilised £802,000 (2016: £nil) of the dilapidations pr ovision held 
for the surplus property at 1 Curzon Street during the year. The impact of discounting led to an additional £82,000 (2016: £1,0 03,000) being 
provided for over the year. 
Amounts payable after one year 
Property-related provisions of £7,949,000 are expected to be settled within 19 years of the balance sheet date, which correspon ds to the 
longest lease for which a dilapidations provision is being held. Provisions for deferred and contingent consideration in busine ss 
combinations of £1,220,000 are expected to be settled within two years of the balance sheet date. Remaining provisions payable after one 
year are expected to be settled within three years of the balance sheet date.

Subordinated loan notes consist of 10-year Tier 2 notes ('Notes'), which are repayable in August 2025, with a call option in Au gust 2020 and 
annually thereafter. Interest is payable at a fixed rate of 5.856% until the first call option date and at a fixed margin of 4. 375% over 6 month 
LIBOR thereafter. An interest expense of £1,276,000 (2016: £1,269,000) was recognised in the year (see note 4). 
27 Long-term employee benefits 
The group operates a defined contribution group personal pens ion scheme and contributes to various other personal pension 
arrangements for certain directors and employees. The total of contributions made to these schemes during the year was £6,213,0 00 (2016: 
£4,595,000). The group also operates a defined contribution scheme for overseas employees, for which the total contributions we re 
£47,000 (2016: £40,000). 
The group operates two defined benefit pension schemes; the Rathbone 1987 Scheme and the Laurence Keen Retirement Benefit 
Scheme. The schemes are currently both clients of Rathbone Invest ment Management, with investments managed on a discretionary 
basis, in accordance with the statements of investment principles agreed by the trustees. Scheme assets are held separately fro m those of 
the group. 
The trustees of the schemes are required to act in the best interest of the schemes' beneficiaries. The appointment of trustees is 
determined by the schemes’ trust documentation and legislation. The group has a policy that one third of all trustees should be nominated 
by members of the schemes. 
The Laurence Keen Scheme was closed to new entrants and future accrual with effect from 30 September 1999. Past service benefit s 
continue to be calculated by reference to final pensionable salaries. From 1 October 1999, all the active members of the Lauren ce Keen 
Scheme were included under the Rathbone 1987 Scheme for accrual of retirement benefits for further service. The Rathbone 1987 S cheme 
was closed to new entrants with effect from 31 March 2002. 
With effect from 30 June 2017, the link between past service benefit and pensionable salaries was broken for both schemes and t he 
Rathbone 1987 Scheme was closed to future accrual from this da te. This resulted in a plan amendment gain of £5,523,000 being recognised 
in operating income on that date. 
The group provides death in service benefi ts to all employees through the Rathbone 1987 Scheme. Third party insurance is purcha sed for 
the benefits where possible and £1,167,000 of related insurance premiums were expensed to profit or loss in the year (2016: £1,134,000). 
The estimated present value of the uninsured death in service benefi ts is included in long term employee benefits liabilities. 
The schemes are valued by independent actuaries at least every three years using the projected unit credit method, which looks at the 
value of benefits accruing over the years following the valuation date based on projected salary to the date of termination of services, 
discounted to a present value using a rate that reflects the characteristics of the liability. The valuations are updated at ea ch balance sheet 
date in between full valuations. The latest full actuarial valuations were carried out as at the following dates: 
Rathbone 1987 Scheme 31 December 2013 
Laurence Keen Scheme 31 December 2013 
During 2017, triennial valuations of both schemes as at 31 Decemb er 2016 were being carried out. These valuations are yet to be formally 
finalised. 
The assumptions used by the actuaries, to estimate the schemes' liabilities, are the best estimates chosen from a range of possible actuarial 
assumptions. Due to the timescale covered by the liability, these assumptions may not necessarily be borne out in practice.

Average age of members at date of transferring out (years) 52.5 52.5 52.5 52.5
* Inflation assumptions are based on the Retail Price Index 
Over the year, the financial assumptions have been amended to reflect changes in market conditions. Specifically: 
1. the discount rate has been decreased by 0.15% to reflect a decrease in the yields available on AA-rated corporate bonds at a 
term consistent with the average duration of the liabilities; 
2. the assumed rate of future inflation is unchanged and reflects expectations of long-term inflation as implied by changes in the 
fixed-interest and index-linked gilts market; 
3. the assumed rates of future increases to pensions in payment are unchanged, consistent with the assumed rate of future 
inflation. 
Over the year the demographic assumptions adopted remain unchanged, other than updating the CMI model used to project future 
improvements in mortality from the 2013 version to the 2016 version. 
The assumed duration of the liabilities for the Laurence Keen Scheme is 16 years (2016: 20 years) and the assumed duration for the 
Rathbone 1987 Scheme is 20 years (2016: 24 years). 
The normal retirement age for members of the Laurence Keen Scheme is 65 (60 for certain former directors). The normal retiremen t age 
for members of the Rathbone 1987 Scheme is 60 for service prior to 1 July 2009 and 65 thereafter, following the introduction of pension 
benefits based on Career Average Revalued Earnings (CARE) from that date. The assumed life expectancy for the membership of bot h 
schemes is based on the S2NA actuarial ta bles (2016: S2NA tables). The assumed life expectations on retirement were:

The statements of investment principles set by the trustees of both schemes were revised in 2015 . They require that the assets of the 
schemes are invested in a diversified portfolio of assets, split between return seeking assets (primarily equities) and safer a ssets (gilts, 
index-linked gilts, corporate bonds and other fixed income investme nts) with a switch to a greater percentage of safer assets over time as 
the schemes mature.  
In the Rathbone 1987 Scheme, the target date for the 100% allocation to safer assets is 31 December 2048. The scheme also seeks to hedge 
around 50% of its interest rate an d inflation risk by using Liability Driven Investment (LDI) strategies. 
In the Laurence Keen Scheme the target date for the 100% allocation to safer assets is 31 December 2040.  
The expected asset allocations at 31 December 2017 as set out in the statements of investment principles are as follows:

During 2017, the Rathbone 1987 Scheme held shares in real time inflation-linked interest rate swap funds, which had a fair valu e of 
£20,222,000 at the year end (2016: £17,365,000). The value of thes e investments is expected to increase when the value of the s cheme's 
liabilities increase (and vice versa). They therefore act to reduce the group's exposure to changes in net defined benefit pens ion obligations 
arising from changes in interest rates and inflation. The funds ar e selected so that their average duration is intended to broa dly align with 
the duration of the scheme's liabilities. 
All equity and debt instruments have quoted prices in active markets. The majority of government bonds are issued by government s of 
the United Kingdom, the United States of America and Germany all of which are rated AAA, AA+ or AA, based on credit ratings awa rded by 
Fitch Ratings Limited (Fitch) or Moody’s Corp oration (Moody’s) as at the balance sheet date. Other sche me assets comprise commo dities 
and property funds, both of which also have quoted prices in active markets. 
The key assumptions affecting the results of the valuation are the discount rate, future inflation, mortality, the rate of memb ers transferring 
out and the average age at the time of transferring out. In order to demonstrate the sensitivity of the results to these assump tions, the 
actuary has recalculated the defined benefit obligations for each scheme by varying each of these assumptions in isolation whil st leaving 
the other assumptions unchanged. For example, in order to demons trate the sensitivity of the results to the discount rate, the actuary has 
recalculated the defined benefit obligations for each scheme using a discount rate that is 0.5% higher than used for calculatin g the 
disclosed figures. A similar approach has been taken to demonstr ate the sensitivity of the results to the other key assumptions . A summary 
of the sensitivities in respect of the total of the two schemes’ defined benefit obligations are set out below.

The total regular contributions made by the group to the Rathbone 1987 Scheme during the year were £856,000 (2016: £2,558,000) based 
on 20.3% of pensionable salaries (2016: 20.3%). Additional lump sum contributions of £2,838,000 were paid in 2017 (2016: £2,917 ,000). The 
group is not committed to making any further deficit reduction contributions as at the year end. As part of the ongoing trienni al valuation, 
the group has agreed with the trustees of the Rathbone 1987 Scheme to put in place a funding deficit reduction plan, which requires 
annual contributions of £2,750,000, so long as that scheme remains in defi cit. The deficit funding plan will be reviewed follow ing the next 
triennial valuation, as at 31 December 2019. 
The total contributions made by the group to the Laurence Keen Sc heme during the year were £nil (2016: £nil). No additional lum p sum 
contributions were paid in 2017 (2016: £nil), and the group has no commitment to make further contributions. Regular contributi ons to  
the Laurence Keen Scheme stopped with effect from 1 January 2015. Although the funding valuation for the Laurence Keen Scheme a s at 
31 December 2016 has not yet been finalised, the group does not expect that material funding deficit contributions will be requ ired.

Share Incentive Plan 
The group operates a Share Incentive Plan (SIP), which is available to all employees. Employees can contribute up to £150 per m onth to 
acquire partnership shares, which are purchased or allotted twice a year at the end of six month accumulation periods. The grou p 
currently matches employee contributions on a one-for-one basis to acquire matching shares. 
The group also provides performance-related free shares, with eligible employees receiving shares valued at the rate of £100 pe r 1% real 
increase in earnings per share up to a maximum of £3,000 per annum. 
For UK employees, SIP dividends are reinvested and used to purchase di vidend shares, whilst for Jersey employees dividends are paid 
in cash. 
As at 31 December 2017, the trustees of the SIP held 1,092,120 (2016: 1,243,979) ordinary shares of 5p each in Rathbone Brother s Plc with a 
total market value of £28,330,000 (2016: £24,668,000). Of the to tal number of shares held by the trustees, 263,165 (2016: 294,680) have 
been conditionally gifted to employees and 10,777 (2016: 1,525) remain unallocated. Dividends on the unallocated shares have be en waived 
by the trustees. 
Savings-related share option or Save As You Earn (SAYE) plan 
Under the SAYE plan, employees can contribute up to £500 per month to acquire shares at the end of a three or five year savings period. 
Options with an aggregate estimated fair value of £625,000, determined using a binomial valuation model including expected divi dends, 
were granted on 28 April 2017 to directors and staff under the SAYE plan. The inputs into the binomial model for options grante d during

Executive Incentive Plan 
Details of the general terms of this plan are set out in the remuneration committee report on page 86. 
Under the remuneration policy, 40% of the total award will be given in cash with the remaining 60% of the award granted in shar es. The 
group treats the cash element of the award as an employee benefit under IAS 19 and the share element of the award as an equity- settled 
share-based payment under IFRS 2. 
Other schemes 
The group operates a number of other plans for rewarding employees. Participants are granted awards under these plans in the fo rm of 
options, which vest automatically on an anniversary of the grant date (generally between one and five years). As the intention is to settle 
the options in such plans in shares, the awards are treated as equity-settled share-based payments under IFRS 2. 
The group recognised total expenses of £3,871,000 in relation to share-based payment transactions in 2017 (2016: £5,201,000) (s ee note 10).

31 Financial risk management 
The group has identified the financial, business and operational risks arising from its activities and has established policies and procedures 
to manage these items in accordance with its risk appetite, as described in the group risk commi ttee report on pages 68 to 69.  
The group categorises its financial risks into the following primary areas: 
(i) credit risk (which includes counterparty default risk); 
(ii) liquidity risk;  
(iii) market risk (which includes fair value interest rate risk, cash flow interest rate risk, foreign exchange risk and price risk); and 
(iv) pension risk. 
The group's exposures to pension risk are set out in note 27. 
The group’s financial risk management policies are designed to identify and analyse the financia l risks that the group faces, to set 
appropriate risk tolerances, limits and controls and to monitor the financial risks and adherence to limits by means of reliabl e and up-to-
date information systems. The group regularly reviews its financia l risk management policies and systems to reflect changes in the 
business, counterparties, markets and the range of financial instruments that it utilises. 
The treasury department, reporting through the banking committee, has principal responsibility for monitoring exposure to credi t risk, 
liquidity risk and market risk. Procedures and delegated authorit ies are documented in a group tr easury manual and policy docum ents 
prescribe the management and monitoring of each type of risk. Th e primary objective of the group’s treasury policy is to manage  
short term liquidity requirements whilst maintaining an appropriate level of exposure to other financial risks in accordance wi th the 
group’s risk appetite. 
(i) Credit risk 
The group takes on exposure to credit risk, which is the risk that a counterparty will be unable to pay amounts in full when due, through its 
banking, treasury, trust and financial planning activities. The principal source of credit risk arises from placing funds in the money market 
and holding interest-bearing securities. The group also has exposu re to credit risk through its client loan book and guarantees given on 
clients’ behalf. 
It is the group’s policy to place funds generated internally and from deposits by clients with a range of high-quality financia l institutions 
and the Bank of England. Investments with financial institutions are spread to avoid excessive exposure to any individual count erparty. 
Loans made to clients are secured against clients’ a ssets that are held and managed by group companies. 
Exposure to credit risk is managed through setting appropriate ratings requirements and lending limits. Limits are reviewed reg ularly, 
taking into account the ability of borrowers and potential borrowers to meet repayment obligations. 
The group categorises its exposures based on the long term ratings awarded to counterparties by Fitch or Moody’s. Each exposure is 
assessed individually, both at inception and in ongoing monitoring. In addition to formal external ratings, the banking committ ee also 
utilises market intelligence information to assist its ongoing monitoring. 
The group's financial assets are categorised as follows: 
Balances with central banks (note 14) 
The group has exposure to central banks through its deposits held with the Bank of England. 
Settlement balances 
Settlement risk arises in any situation where a payment in cash or transfer of a security is made in the expectation of a corre sponding 
delivery of a security or receipt of cash. The majority of transactions are carried out on a delivery versus payment basis, whi ch results 
in securities and cash being exchanged within a very close timeframe. Settlement balances outside standard terms are monitored on a 
daily basis. 
The Investment Management and Unit Trusts segments have exposure to market counterparties in the settlement of trades. 
Settlement balances arising in the Investment Management segment are primarily in relation to client trades and risk of non-set tlement 
is borne by clients.

(i)  Credit risk continued 
Loans and advances to banks (note 15) and debt and other securities (note 17) 
The group has exposures to a wide range of financial institutions through its treasury portfolio, which includes bank deposits, certificates of 
deposit, money market funds and treasury bills. These exposures principally arise from the placement of clients' cash, where it is held 
under a banking relationship, and the group’s own reserves. 
The group’s policy requires that all such exposures are only taken with counterparties that have been awarded a minimum long te rm 
rating of single A by Fitch or equivalent rating by Moody’s. Co unterparty limits are also in place to limit exposure to an indi vidual 
counterparty or connected group of counterparties. Counterparty exposures are monitored on a daily basis by the treasury depart ment 
and reviewed by the banking committee on a monthly basis, or more frequently when necessary. The banking committee may suspend 
dealing in a particular counterparty, or liquidate specif ic holdings, in light of adverse market information. 
Loans and advances to customers (note 16) 
The group provides loans to clients through its investment manage ment operations ('the investment management loan book'). The g roup 
is also exposed to credit risk on overdrafts on clients' investment management accounts, trade debtors arising from the trust, tax and 
financial planning businesses ('trust and financial planning debtors') and other debtors. 
(a) Overdrafts 
Overdrafts on clients’ investment management accounts arise from time-to-time due to short term timing differences between the 
purchase and sale of assets on a client's behalf. Overdrafts are actively monitored and reported to the banking committee on a 
monthly basis. 
(b) Investment management loan book 
Loans are provided as a service to investment management clients who are generally asset rich but have short to medium term cas h 
requirements. Such loans are normally made on a fully secured ba sis against portfolios held in Rathbones’ nominee name, and som e 
loans may be partially secured by property. Extensions to the in itial loan period may be granted subject to credit criteria. 
At 31 December 2017, the total lending exposure limit for the investment management loan book was £175,000,000  
(2016: £150,000,000), of which £120,433,000 had been advanced (2016: £106,276,000) and a further £30,025,000 had been  
committed (2016: £31,642,000). 
(c) Trust and financial planning debtors 
Trust and financial planning debtors relate to fees which have been invoiced but not yet settled by clients. The collection and ageing of 
trust and financial planning debtors are reviewed on a monthly basis by the management committees of the group’s trust and fina ncial 
planning businesses. Impairment provisions are made for any debts which are considered to be doubtful for collection. 
(d) Other debtors 
Other loans and advances to customers re late to management fees receivable. 
Impairment and provisioning policies 
Impairment provisions are recognised for financial reporting purposes only for losses that have been incurred at the balance sh eet date, 
based on objective evid ence of impairment. 
All credit exposures are reviewed individually, at least annually , or more regularly when individual circumstances require. Imp airment 
allowances on credit exposures are determined by an evaluation of the incurred loss at the balance sheet date on a case by case basis. The 
assessment considers, where applicable, the value of any security and/or collateral held, any changes to the external credit ra ting and the 
anticipated receipts for each individual exposure. 
Impairment provisions for credit risk, which relate solely to trust and financial planning debtors, are set out in note 16.

* Cash held within the Employee Benefit Trust 
The credit quality of loans and advances to customers that were neither past due nor impaired at 31 December 2017, which are al l 
externally unrated, is analysed between those loans that are subject to standard lending criteria, which are described on page 152, and, 
where applicable, those loans for which there are no standard lending criteria. At 31 December 2017, all loans are subject to s tandard 
lending criteria (2016: all loans). An exposure is reported as past due when the contractual due date for settlement has passed and the 
balance has not been repaid, except in the case of trust and financial planning debtors, where a normal settlement period of up to 30 
days is expected. 
(b) Past due but not impaired 
Loans and advances that are past due are assessed for impairment and provided against where objective evidence of impairment 
exists. Trust and financial planning debtors may be outstanding fo r some time before collection, but this is not necessarily an indication 
that the debt will not ultimately be collected. At 31 December 2017 and 2016, no overdrafts, loans and other debtors were past due but 
not impaired. The gross amounts of trust and financial planning debtors that were past due but not impaired were:

Concentration of credit risk 
The group has counterparty credit risk within its treasury assets in that exposure is to a number of similar credit institution s. The banking 
committee actively monitors counterparties and may reduce risk by either suspending dealing or liquidating investments in light of 
adverse market information, for example in anticipation of or in response to any formal Fitch or Moody’s rating downgrade. This may 
happen in relation to specific banks or banks within a particular country or sector. 
(a) Geographical sectors 
The following table analyses the group’s credit exposures, at their carrying amounts, by geographical region as at the balance sheet date.

(ii) Liquidity risk 
Liquidity risk is the risk that the group will encounter difficulty in meeting obligations associated with financial liabilitie s that are settled by 
delivering cash or another financial asset. 
The primary objective of the group’s treasury policy is to manage short to medium term liquidity requirements. In addition to s etting the 
treasury policy, Rathbone Investment Management ('the Bank') pe rforms an annual assessment of liquidity adequacy in accordance with 
the regulatory requirements of the Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA) (our Individual Liquidity Adequacy Assessment). The Ba nk 
faces two principal risks, namely that a significant proportion of client funds are withdrawn over a short period of time (reta il funding risk) 
and the risk that marketable assets may not be capable of being realised in the time and at the value required (marketable asse ts risk). 
Retail funding risks are monitored by daily cash mismatch analyses and Basel Committee ratios using expected cash and asset mat urity 
profiles and regular forecasting work. This is supported by stress tests which cover firm-specific idiosyncratic scenarios and/or the effects 
of unforeseen market wide stresses. Market able assets risk is primarily managed by holding cash and marketable instruments whic h are 
realisable at short notice. The group operates strict criteria to ensure that investments are liquid and placed wi th high-quality 
counterparties. A minimum liquid assets buffer (to be held in eligible liquid assets) is set by the board at least annually in conjunction with 
an amount prescribed by the PRA. 
Non-derivative cash flows

Liabilities which do not have a contractual maturity date are categorised as 'on demand'. Included within the amounts due to cu stomers 
on demand are balances which historical experience shows are unli kely to be called in the short term. A prudent level of highly liquid 
assets is retained to cover reasonably foreseeable short term ch anges in client deposits. All debt securities are readily marketable and can 
be realised through disposals.  
The group holds £2,565,000 of equity investments (2016: £1,864,000) which are subject to liquidity risk but are not included in the table 
above. These assets are held as available for sale securities and have no fixed maturity date; cash flows arise from receipt of dividends or 
through sale of the assets.

(iii) Market risk 
Interest rate risk 
Cash flow interest rate risk is the risk that the future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market 
interest rates. Fair value interest rate risk is the risk that the value of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of ch anges in market 
interest rates. 
The group’s principal exposure to cash flow interest rate risk arises from the mismatch between the repricing of its financial assets and 
liabilities. In particular, customer accounts and loan balances are repriced very shortly after changes in base rates, whereas the yield on the 
group’s interest-bearing assets is correlated to the future expe ctation of base rates and varies depending on the maturity prof ile of the 
group’s treasury portfolio. The average maturity mismatch is controlled by the banking committee, which generally lengthens the 
mismatch when the yield curve is rising and sh ortens it when the yield curve is falling. 
The table below shows the consolidated repricing profile of the group’s financial assets and liabilities, stated at their carry ing amounts, 
categorised by the earlier of contractual repricing or maturity dates.

Interest rate repricing gap (243,309) 153,758 325,000 (19,590) –  (27,618) 188,241 
The banking committee has set an overall pre-tax interest rate ex posure limit of £6,000,000 (2016: £6,000,000) for the total po tential profit 
or loss resulting from an unexpected immediat e and sustained 2% movement in sterling interest rates for the Bank, the principal operating 
subsidiary. The potential total profit or loss is calculated on the basis of the average number of days to repricing of the int erest-bearing 
liabilities compared with the period to repricing on a corresponding amount of interest-bearing assets. 
At 31 December 2017, the Bank had a net present value sensitivity of £4,310,000 (2016: £3,696,000) for an upward 2% shift in ra tes.  
The group held no forward rate agreements at 31 December 2017 (2016: none).  
Foreign exchange risk 
The group is exposed to translational foreign exchange risk as it undertakes transactions in foreign currencies and is therefor e exposed to 
foreign exchange rate fluctuations. The group monitors its currency exposures that arise in the ordinary course of business on a daily basis 
and significant exposures are managed through the use of spot cont racts, from time-to-time, so as to reduce any currency exposu re to a 
minimal amount. The group has no structural foreign currency exposure.

A 10% weakening of the US dollar against sterling, occurring on 31 December 2017, would have increased equity and profit after tax by 
£86,000 (2016: reduced by £124,000). A 10% weakening of the euro against sterling, occurring on 31 December 2017, would have re duced 
equity and profit after tax by £104,000 (201 6: reduced by £30,000). A 10% strengthening of the US dollar or euro would have had an equal 
and opposite effect. This analysis assume s that all other variables, in particular other exchange rates, remain constant.

Price risk 
Price risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market  prices 
(other than those arising from interest rate risk or foreign exchange risk). The group is exposed to price risk through its holdings of equity 
investment securities, which are reported at their fair value (note 17). 
At 31 December 2017, the fair value of equity securities recognised on the balance sheet was £2,565,000 (2016: £1,864,000). A 1 0% fall in 
global equity markets would, in isolation, result in a pre-tax decrease to net assets of £133,000 (2016: £110,000); there would be no impact 
on profit after tax. A 10% rise in global markets would have had an equal and opposite effect. 
Fair values 
The table below analyses financial instruments measured at fair value into a fair value hierarchy based on the valuation techni que used to 
determine the fair value. 
– Level 1: quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. 
– Level 2: inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directl y or indirectly. 
– Level 3: inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data.

The group recognises transfers between levels of the fair value hierarchy at the end of the reporting period during which the c hange has 
occurred. There have been no transfers between levels during the year (2016: none). 
The fair value of listed equity securities is their quoted price. Money market funds are demand securities and changes to estim ates of 
interest rates will not affect their fair value. The fair va lue of money market funds is their daily redemption value. 
The fair values of the group’s other financial assets and liabilities are not materially different from their carrying values, with the exception 
of the following: 
– Held to maturity investment debt securities (note 17) comprise bank and building society certific ates of deposit, which have fi xed 
coupons. The fair value of debt securities at 31 December 2017 was £704,002,000 (2016: £704,815,000) and the carrying value was 
£701,966,000 (2016: £700,000,000). Fair value for held to maturity assets is based on market bid prices, and hence would be 
categorised as level 1 within the fair value hierarchy. 
– Subordinated loan notes (note 26) comprise Ti er 2 loan notes. The fair va lue of the loan notes at 31 December 2017 was £20,478, 000 
(2016: £19,578,000) and the carrying value was £19,695,000 (2016: £19,590,000). Fair value of the loan notes is based on discou nted 
future cash flows using current market rates for debts with similar remaining maturity, and hence would be categorised as level 2 in the 
fair value hierarchy.

32 Capital management 
Rathbone Brothers Plc's capital is defined for accounting purposes as total equity. As at 31 December 2017 this totalled £363,2 78,000 (2016: 
£324,813,000). 
Rathbone Investment Management has issued 10 year subordinated Tier 2 loan notes (note 26). As at 31 December 2017, the carryin g value 
of the notes was £19,675,000 (2016: £19,590,000). From time-to-ti me, the group also runs small overnight overdraft balances as part of 
working capital. 
The group’s objectives when managing capital are to: 
– safeguard the group’s ability to continue as a going concern so that it can continue to provide returns for shareholders and benefits for 
other stakeholders; 
– maintain a strong capital base in a cost-efficient manner to be able to support the development of the business when required; 
– optimise the distribution of capital across group comp anies, reflecting the requirements of each business; 
– strive to make capital freely transferable across the group where possible; and 
– comply with regulatory requirements at all times. 
Rathbones is classified for capital purposes as a banking group an d performs an Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process  ( ICAAP), 
which is presented to the PRA on an annual basis. Regulatory capital resources for ICAAP purposes are calculated in  accordance with 
published rules. These require certain adjustments to and certain deductions from accounting capital, the latter largely in res pect of 
intangible assets. The ICAAP compares regulatory capital resources against regulatory capital requirements derived using the PR A’s Pillar 1 
and Pillar 2 methodology. The group has adopte d the standardised approach to calculating its Pillar 1 credit risk component and the basic 
indicator approach to calculating its operational risk component. Capital management  policy and practices are applied at both group and 
entity level. 
At 31 December 2017 the group’s regulatory capital resources, including retained earnings for 2017, were £216,838,000 (2016: £1 74,192,000). 
The increase in reserves during 2017 is du e an increase in the group's retained earnin gs on account of profits generated in the year and the 
gain on remeasurement of the defined benefit liabilities.  
In addition to a variety of stress tests performed as part of the ICAAP process, and daily reporting in respect of treasury act ivity, capital 
levels are monitored and forecast on a monthly basis to ensure that dividends and investment requirements are appropriately man aged 
and appropriate buffers are kept ag ainst adverse business conditions. 
No breaches were reported to the PRA during the financial years ended 31 December 2016 and 2017.  
33 Contingent liabilities and commitments 
(a) Capital expenditure authorised and contracted for at 31 December 2017 but not provided in the financial statements amounted to 
£48,000 (2016: £4,430,000). 
(b) The contractual amounts of the group’s commitments to extend credit to its clients are as follows: 
  
2017 
£’000 
2016
£’000 
Guarantees 117  117 
Undrawn commitments to lend of 1 year or less 20,985  25,661 
Undrawn commitments to lend of more than 1 year 9,040  5,981 
  30,142  31,759 
The fair value of the guarantees is £nil (2016: £nil).

(c) The group leases various offices and other assets under non-cancellable operating lease agreements. The leases have varying ter ms 
and renewal rights. At 31 December 2017, the group’s agreements to lease space at 8 Finsbury Circus had remaining lease terms o f 15 
years; total payments due over this period are £75,946,000. The leases provide for rent reviews every 5 years.

The above table excludes total lease payments of £18,124,000, at 31 December 2017, under the group’s agreement for leased space at 1 
Curzon Street, as these payments are included as part of the cash flows that comprise the onerous lease provision for that prop erty 
(see note 25). These cash flows have been included in ‘Other financial liabilities’ in note 31. 
(d) The arrangements put in place by the Financial Services Compensation Scheme (FSCS) to protect depositors and investors from los s 
in the event of failure of financial institutions has resulted in significant levies on the industry in recent years. The financial impact of 
unexpected FSCS levies is largely out of the group’s control as they result from other industry failures. 
There is uncertainty over the level of future FSCS levies as they depend on the ultimate cost to the FSCS of industry failures. The 
group contributes to the deposit class, investment fund manageme nt class and investment intermediation levy classes and accrues 
levy costs for future levy years when the obligation arises.

Other related party transactions 
The group’s transactions with the pension funds are described in note 27. At 31 December 2017, no amounts were outstanding with either 
the Laurence Keen Scheme or the Rathbone 1987 Scheme (2016: £nil). 
One group subsidiary, Rathbone Unit Trust Management, has authority to manage the investments within a number of unit trusts. 
Another group company, Rathbone Investment Management International, acted as investment manager for a protected cell company 
offering unitised private client portfolio services. During 2017, the group managed 25 unit trusts, Sociétés d'Investissement à Capital 
Variable (SICAVs) and open-ended investme nt companies (OEICs) (together, 'collectives') (2016: 25 unit trusts and OEICs). 
The group charges each fund an annual management fee for these services, but does not earn any performance fees on the unit trusts.  
The management charges are calculated on the bases published in the individual fund prospectuses, which also state the terms an d 
conditions of the management contract with the group. 
The following transactions and balances relate to the group’s interest in the unit trusts:

Total management fees are included within 'fee and commission income' in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income. 
Management fees owed to the group are included within 'accrued income' and holdings in unit trus ts are classified as 'available for sale 
equity securities' in the consolidated balance sheet. The maximum exposure to loss is limited to the carrying amount on the bal ance sheet 
as disclosed above. 
All amounts outstanding with related parties are unsecured and will be settled in cash. No guarantees have been given or receiv ed.  
No provisions have been made for doubtful debts in respect of the amounts owed by related parties. 
35 Interest in unconsolidated structured entities 
As described in note 34, at 31 December 2017, the group owned un its in collectives managed by Rathbone Unit Trust Management wi th  
a value of £2,565,000 (2016: £1,864,000), representing 0.05% (2016: 0.05%) of the total value of the collectives managed by the group.  
These assets are held to hedge the group's exposure to de ferred remuneration schemes fo r employees of Unit Trusts. 
The group's primary risk associated with its interest in the unit trusts is from changes in fair value of its holdings in the f unds. 
The group is not judged to control, and therefore does not consol idate, the collectives. Although the fund trustees have limite d rights to 
remove Rathbone Unit Trust Management as manager, the group is exposed to very low variability of returns from its management a nd 
share of ownership of the funds and is therefore judged to act as an agent rather than having control under IFRS 10.

38 Country-by-country reporting 
Introduction 
HM Treasury has transposed the requirements set out under Capi tal Requirements Directive IV (CRD IV) and issued the Capital 
Requirements Country-by-Country Reporting Regulations 2013, effective 1 January 2014. The legislation requires Rathbone Brother s Plc 
(together with its subsidiaries, ‘the group’) to publish certain additional information, on a consolidated basis, for the year ended  
31 December 2017. 
Basis of preparation: 
Country In most cases, we have determined the country by reference to the country of tax residence. Where an 
entity is not subject to tax (e.g. a partnership) we have considered the location of management or the 
jurisdiction in which the revenues are generated. In these cases it is possib le that tax is paid in a different 
country to the one in wh ich profits are reported. 
Nature of activities The nature of activities within the United Kingdom are described within our services on page 2 to 5. 
Discretionary investment management is the sole activity which occurs in Jersey. 
Turnover Turnover is defined as operating income. As the cons olidated results are split by country, there is an 
element of double counting when inter-jurisdictional transactions (for example, the payment of dividends) 
occur. The entries to eliminate this double counting are included at the bottom of the table to enable the 
disclosed figures to agree to the published consolidated accounts of the group. 
Profit/(loss) before taxation These are accounting profits. As with turnover some double counting may arise and again this has been 
eliminated at the bottom of the table. The majority of the total relates to the elimination of inter-
jurisdictional dividends which are reflected as profits in the United Kin gdom. 
Tax paid This column reflects corporation tax actually paid in the year. Note that it is rare that tax paid in any given 
year relates directly to the profits earned in the same period. 
Public subsidies received The group received no public subsidies in the year.
Number of employees The number of employees reported is the average number of full time employees who were permanently 
employed by the group, or one of its subsidia ries, during the year. Contractors are excluded. 
Subsidiaries A list of the subsidiaries of the group, including their main activity and country of incorporation, is shown 
within note 43.

Deferred, variable costs to acquire client relationship intangible s of £2,743,000 arose during the year, in relation to deferre d payments to 
investment managers and third parties linked to the value of client funds introduced (2016: £7,820,000). 
Deferred and contingent consideration of £1,220,000 (2016: £1,136,000) is the present value of amounts payable at the end of 20 19 in 
respect of the acquisition of Vision Independent Financial Planning and Castle Investment Solutions. 
Property-related provisions of £1 3,639,000 relate to dila pidation and onerous lease provisions expected to arise on leasehold p remises held 
by the company (2016: £2,705,000). Dilapidation provisions are calculated using a discounted cash flow model; during the year, provisions 
have decreased by £544,000 (2016: increased by £964,000) due to the utilisation of the dilapidation provision held for surplus property at  
1 Curzon Street during the year. 
Provisions payable after one year are expect ed to be settled within two years of the balance sheet date (2016: three years), except for the 
property-related provisions of £7,845,000 (2016: £1,413,000). These are expected to be settled within 19 years of the balance s heet date 
(2016: 20 years).

51 Financial instruments 
The company's risk management policies and procedures are integrated with the wider Rathbones group's risk management process. The 
Rathbones group has identified the risks arising from all of its activities, including those of the company, and has established policies and 
procedures to manage these items in accordance with its risk appetite. The company categorises its financial risks into the following 
primary areas: 
(i) credit risk; 
(ii) liquidity risk;  
(iii) market risk (which includes fair value interest rate risk, cash flow interest rate risk, foreign exchange risk and price risk); and 
(iv) pension risk. 
The company's exposures to pension risk are set out in note 27 to the consolidated financial statements. 
The sections below outline the group risk appetite, as applicable to the company, and explain how the company defines and manag es 
each category of financial risk. 
The company’s financial risk management policies are designed to identify and analyse the financial risks that the company face s, to set 
appropriate risk tolerances, limits and controls and to monitor the financial risks and adherence to limits by means of reliabl e and up-to-
date information systems. The company regularly reviews its financ ial risk management policies an d systems to reflect changes i n the 
business and the wider industry. 
The company’s overall strategy and policies for monitoring and management of financial risk are set by the board of directors ( the board). 
The board has embedded risk management within the business through the executive committee and senior management. 
(i) Credit risk 
The company takes on exposure to credit risk, which is the risk that a counterparty will be unable to pay amounts in full when due, 
through its trading activities. The principal sources of credit risk arise from depositing funds with banks and through providi ng long term 
and working capital financing for subsidiaries.  
The company's financial assets are categorised as follows: 
Trade and other receivables 
Trade and other receivables relate to amounts placed with subsid iaries, loans provided to subsidiaries and derivative financial instruments. 
The collection and ageing of trade and other receivables are reviewed on a periodic basis by management. Impairment provisions are 
made for any debts which are consider ed to be doubtful for collection. 
The company places surplus funds with its banking subsidiary, which operates under the group's credit risk management policies. Group 
policy requires that funds are placed with a range of high-quality financial institutions. Investments are spread to avoid exce ssive exposure 
to any individual counterparty. 
For the purposes of financial reporting the company categorises it s exposures based on the long term ratings awarded to counter parties 
by Fitch or Moody’s.  
Cash and cash equivalents (balances at banks) 
The company has exposure to financial institutions through its bank deposits (reported within cash equivalents).  
Impairment and provisioning policies 
Impairment provisions are recognised for financial reporting purposes only for losses that have been incurred at the balance sh eet date, 
based on objective evid ence of impairment. 
All credit exposures are reviewed individually, at least annually or more regularly when individual circumstances require. Impairment 
allowances on credit exposures are determined by an evaluation of the incurred loss at the balance sheet date on a case by case basis.  
No impairment losses arose during the year or in 2016.

Included within trade and other pa yables disclosed above are balances that are repayable on demand or that do not have a contractual 
maturity date, which historical experience shows are unlikely to be called in the short term. 
Included within other financial liabilities disclosed above are cash flows for lease payments under the company’s agreement for leased 
space at 1 Curzon Street. These contractual payments comprise part of the onerous lease provision for that property (see note 2 5). 
The company holds £2,565,000 of equity inve stments (2016: £1,864,000) which are subject to liquidity risk but are not included in the table 
above. These assets are held as available for sale securities and have no fixed maturity date; cash flows arise from receipt of dividends or 
through sale of the assets. 
Off-balance sheet items 
Cash flows arising from the company’s off-balance sheet financial liabilities arise solely from operating leases (note 53) and are 
summarised in the table below. Future minimum lease payments under non-cancellable operating leases are reported by their 
contractual payment dates.

(iii) Market risk 
Interest rate risk 
Cash flow interest rate risk is the risk that the future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market 
interest rates. Fair value interest rate risk is the risk that the value of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of ch anges in market 
interest rates. 
The company’s principal exposure to cash fl ow interest rate risk arises from the mismatch between the repricing of its financia l assets 
and liabilities. 
The table below shows the repricing profile of the company’s financial assets and liabilities, stated at their carrying amounts , categorised by 
the earlier of contractual repricing or maturity dates.

A 10% weakening of the US dollar against sterling, occurring on 31 December 2017, would have reduced equity and profit after ta x by 
£20,000 (2016: £21,000). A 10% strengthening of the US dollar woul d have had an equal and opposite effect. This analysis assume s that all 
other variables, in particular other exchange rates, remain constant. 
Price risk 
The group's exposure to price risk, all of which is through the company's holdings of equity in vestment securities, is describe d in note 31. 
Fair values 
The table below analyses financial instruments measured at fair value into a fair value hierarchy based on the valuation techni que used to 
determine the fair value. 
— Level 1: quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. 
— Level 2: inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directl y or indirectly. 
— Level 3: inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data.

The company recognises transfers between levels of the fair value hierarchy at the end of the reporting period during which the change 
has occurred. There have been no transfers between levels during the year (2016: none). 
Details of the methods and assumptions used to determine the fair values of the financial assets in the above table, along with how 
reasonably possible changes to the assumptions affect these fair values, are provided in note 31 to the consolidated financial statements. 
The fair values of the company’s financial assets and liabilities are not materially different from their carrying values, with the exception of 
equity investments in subsidiaries, which are carried at historical cost (note 43).

52 Capital management 
The company’s objectives when managing capital are to:  
— safeguard the company’s ability to continue as a going concern so that it can continue to provide returns for shareholders and  benefits 
for other stakeholders; and 
— maintain a strong capital base to support the developmen t of its business. 
For monitoring purposes, the company defines capital as distributa ble reserves (see note 42). The company monitors the level of 
distributable reserves on a monthl y basis and compares this to forecast dividends. Capital is distributed to the company from  operating 
subsidiaries on a timely basis to ensure sufficient capital is maintained. The board of directors considers the level of capital  held in relation 
to forecast performance, dividend payments and wider plans for the business, although formal quantitative targets  are not set. 
There were no changes in the company’s approach to capital management during the year. 
53 Contingent liabilities and commitments 
The group leases various offices and other assets under non-cancellable operating lease agreements. The leases have varying ter ms and 
renewal rights. At 31 December 2017, the company’s agreements to lease space at 8 Finsbury Circus had remaining lease terms of 15 years; 
total payments due over this period are £75,946,000. The leases provide for rent reviews every five years.
