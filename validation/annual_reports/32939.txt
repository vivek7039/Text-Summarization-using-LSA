ability to roam across multiple networks on 
a single SIM, intelligently seeking out the 
best signal and the most commercially attractive 
network. This is supported by a flexible ‘Service 
Management Platform’ to enable strategic 
partners real time control of tariffs, provisioning 
and usage control. The proposition is especially 
attractive to customers where mobile 
connectivity is critical for the delivery of an 
end service such as Lone Working, Alarm 
Monitoring and Telehealth. Increasingly, we 
see demand in growing ‘Internet of Things’ 
sectors such as logistics, transport, security 
monitoring, utilities and energy.

mainland Europe, the USA, and the UK, we 
provide extremely competitive solutions for 
every type of business enterprise looking

for 2017, with stable trading performance and strong 
underlying cash flow which continues to support our 
progressive dividend policy.
chairman’s statement
Our core business continues to 
perform solidly. As announced 
previously, revenue levels in 2017 were 
impacted by customer consolidation 
in our Data Centre operations during 
2016 and the rescheduling of our 
directory distribution. This revenue 
reduction was offset in part through 
continued growth in our Global 
Solutions business, driven by our 
Strongest Signal Mobile solution, 
M2M, and international traveller 
propositions. The agreement signed 
with China Unicom in December 
2016 to provide connectivity for 
China Unicom’s UK based Mobile 
Virtual Network Operator (MVNO) 
service grew slowly in 2017, due 
to technological challenges which 
have now been addressed, and  
we expect this agreement to bring 
further growth in 2018.
Our Transformation Programme, 
launched in October 2016, 
is progressing well with the 
implementation of IT systems 
and improvements in our internal 
processes and organisational 
structure. The associated costs 
are on track and the programme 
is due to complete in 2018.
Vannin Ventures was launched 
in 2016 to create future medium- 
term growth opportunities for the 
Company. Following on from its 
acquisition of Partitionware in 2016, it 
acquired a second company, Goshawk 
Communications Limited, a business 
focused on services to help the hard 
of hearing.
The Isle of Man economy remains 
stable and resilient with unemployment 
at only 0.8%. We continue to work 
with the Isle of Man Government on 
attracting business to the Island, and 
our telecommunications infrastructure 
and services play an important part 
in the Island’s continued success.
Dividend
The Board has declared a final 
dividend of 7.5p per share to be paid 
on 29 June 2018. This will bring the 
full year dividend to 11.4p (2016: 10.9p). 
The shares will trade ex-dividend on 
24 May 2018 and will have a record 
date of 25 May 2018.
Outlook
The Company’s strategy continues 
to focus on both maintaining our core 
market position on the Isle of Man 
through high quality customer service 
enhanced by our Transformation 
Programme, and seeking on- and 
off-island growth by leveraging our 
mobile infrastructure and exploring 
new innovative products and services 
for our customers.

We expect that our core domestic

will be supported by continued 
improvement in our on-island network 
infrastructure, resulting in overall stable 
revenues in our core lines of business.
We remain positive about the future 
progress in our Global Solutions 
business, building upon the successes 
of 2017 and with new opportunities 
also starting to contribute revenue. 
Following the return to growth within 
our Data Centre business in H2 2017, 
we expect this area of the business will 
continue to grow in 2018, supported 
by new product development.
The recent acquisitions of 
Partitionware in 2016 and Goshawk 
in 2017 by our business incubator, 
Vannin Ventures, are exciting 
opportunities that we expect 
will contribute to the Group’s 
growth strategy.
Our net debt/underlying EBITDA 
ratio of 2.1x (2016: 1.9x) and £10m 
of committed and unutilised loan 
facilities at year end means that 
we are well capitalised.
The Group’s excellent cash conversion 
enables us to support our ongoing 
Transformation Programme and our 
progressive dividend policy.

investment case
Strong core market position
Manx Telecom is the leading communications 
solutions provider on the Island with market 
share positions in mobile, broadband, data centre 
and fixed-line segments. We have a 128-year 
heritage and own the entire copper network, 
most of the fibre network, and have invested 
over £100m in the last 12 years to grow our  
position. We have a strong affiliation with the 
Isle of Man Government and a relationship with 
nearly every business and consumer on the Island.
Favourable 
macro backdrop
The Isle of Man is a leading 
international business centre renowned 
for innovation, professionalism, and 
a policy of positive engagement with 
other jurisdictions. Best known for its 
financial services industry, the Island 
has successfully diversified across 
sectors including e-business, e-gaming 
and high-tech manufacturing. As such, 
the Isle of Man is a growing, affluent, 
low tax economy keen to embrace 
new technology.
Differentiated and 
competitive offering
Manx Telecom focuses on providing a 
superior network and customer service 
and with it, a reliable and trustworthy 
reputation, competing on value rather 
than price alone. We are especially 
proud of the fact that after 10 years of 
competition in the local mobile market, 
we have retained a market share of 
over 70%. This has been underpinned 
by investment in a world-class 4G 
network providing 99% population 
coverage on the Island.

Exploiting new market 
growth opportunities
Off-Island, Manx Telecom has successfully 
developed its Global Solutions business, such that 
it now represents c.20% of revenues. We utilise 
our domestic mobile technology platform and 
international roaming agreements to offer a range 
of SIM-based solutions to UK and international 
partners. This strategy was supplemented in 2016 
by the creation of Vannin Ventures, a 100%-owned 
business incubator targeting new innovative 
technologies and opportunities.
Progressive dividend 
policy backed by strong 
free cash flow
Since its admission to AIM in 2014, Manx Telecom 
has recorded stable trading performance and 
strong underlying cash flow. Our Transformation 
Programme will help to ensure this is maintained, 
and an experienced management team is in place 
to drive further efficiencies and growth in free 
cash flow, especially. This supports our progressive 
dividend policy, which has been maintained since 
admission at an annual increase of c.5%.

manx telecom plc
annual report and accounts 2017
Change is a constant in the telecoms industry, which 
means we are challenged daily to grow our revenue 
profitably and sustainably. Here we review some of the 
market trends affecting us.
market review
So-called ‘over-the-top’ (OTT) 
providers such as WhatsApp, 
Facebook, Google and Apple have 
redefined the customer experience 
in messaging and video services. 
Increasingly sophisticated smartphones 
have become the focus and customer 
control-point for these services. 
Consumers and businesses have 
embraced the value and utility in these 
applications, which has had a direct 
impact on legacy telecommunications 
services, and a positive impact on our 
industry as a whole.
Like all operators, we have seen 
a sustained decline in the use of 
traditional fixed line and mobile 
calling and text usage on our network. 
However, this has been more than 
offset by growth in the use of 
connectivity and data, the driving force 
behind many new applications. In 2017 , 
we saw a 43% increase in data usage 
on our fixed line network and a 89% 
increase in data usage on our 
mobile network.
The long-term growth in data demand 
from our customers has fundamentally 
impacted our capital investment 
strategy over recent years. Our 4G 
mobile network was specified to the 
highest levels of quality and provides 
99% population coverage on the Isle 
of Man. For our fixed line network, 
we have adopted twin strategies of 
increased Fibre to the Cabinet (FTTC) 
roll-out, supported by the introduction 
of direct Fibre to the Premise (FTTP) 
connectivity. Mobile or fixed, we 
are well placed to meet the Island’s 
growing demand for high-speed 
and low-latency data services.
‘Machine to machine’ communication 
is becoming instantaneous, 
continuous and cheap. It’s also at the 
very heart of the Internet of Things 
(IoT) market, in which almost anything 
– processes, machines and everyday 
objects – can automatically exchange 
data. In doing so, this is creating new 
opportunities, new ways of doing 
things, new revenue streams, and in 
some cases entirely new products, 
services and sectors. Some market 
estimates predict over 50 billion 
devices will be connected worldwide 
by 2020. Smart cities and connected, 
driverless cars are regularly quoted as 
examples of major initiatives falling 
within the scope of the IoT market.
By working with a network of UK and 
internationally based partners who 
specialise in extracting maximum 
value from the opportunities that 
the IoT market affords, our smart SIM 
technology provides the connectivity 
necessary for any organisation to 
begin to transform the way they 
do business. Our Global Solutions 
business is well placed to capitalise 
on the opportunities in the IoT market, 
and we’re already seeing huge 
potential for example in the logistics, 
transport, security monitoring, 
utilities and energy sectors.
 
The telecoms 
market
The telecommunications 
industry is continuing to change 
at breakneck speed, especially 
as data-hungry customers 
with smart devices consume 
even more bandwidth. The 
smartphone revolution has 
triggered a growth in mobile 
applications which has seen a 
range of disruptive players enter 
the industry. The markets we 
operate in are characterised by:
 – regular technology changes.
 – product convergence.
 – increasing competition.
 – falling prices.
 – rapid changes in customer 
behaviour.
 – a widening digital ecosystem.
 – shortening product life cycles.
 
In our home market, we 
are well placed to act as a 
catalyst of transformation in 
a fast-changing digital society. 
We do this by paying close 
attention to the changes we 
see in our industry and adapting 
our strategies and behaviour 
to ensure we stay relevant to 
the businesses and consumers 
we serve.

Delivering a high-quality customer 
experience is one of our top goals – 
it’s already a cornerstone of our brand 
reputation. We aim to put customers 
at the front and centre of everything 
they do, which means we have to be 
even more agile, efficient and focused 
on network quality – and must have 
differentiators in a world where our 
customers have an ever-widening set 
of relationships with Manx Telecom 
and a range of digital newcomers.
A new generation of ‘millennial’ 
customers have different and higher 
expectations from a service provider 
such as Manx Telecom. These 
customers have never lived in a world 
without digital. As such, they expect 
seamless online and offline interactions 
and will quickly make their voices heard 
should convenience and quality fail to 
live up to their expectations.
Investment in IT systems and process 
improvement is a fundamental 
pre-cursor to an improved digital 
customer experience, and is a major 
part of our own transformation 
programme. Higher levels of support, 
more personalised services and 
greater adoption of online ‘self-care’ 
services are all goals we are striving 
to attain to unlock a new experience 
for the businesses and consumers 
we serve.
Analytics-based insights and virtualised 
networks and IT are arguably the top 
drivers of innovative capabilities in the 
telecommunications market. Analytics 
is widely perceived as being mainly 
about gaining a deeper understanding 
of customers, whereas virtualisation is 
technology that allows the creation of 
IT services that are traditionally bound 
to hardware.
We were one of the first operators 
in the world to embrace virtualisation, 
when we migrated our entire fixed line 
customer base onto a software based, 
cloud computing fixed line platform, 
which, in the longer term, will make 
it possible to introduce new services 
faster for consumers and businesses. 
It means that we’re now a world leader 
in the evolution of fixed line network 
technology and a great example of 
continued investment and innovation 
enabling the Isle of Man to keep up 
with the ever-increasing advancements 
in communications technology.
We’re also determined to bring 
the benefits of virtualisation to our 
customers with products such as 
Virtual Desktop Infrastructure (VDI), 
which effectively removes and hosts 
the application software for a regular 
business desktop in the Manx Telecom 
Cloud, providing cost and efficiency 
benefits with no loss of capability.

customers to upgrade. Our mobile Smartroam 
packages, offering inclusive roaming to UK and 
EU destinations, have proved especially popular 
amongst consumers and will be rolled out to 
businesses in 2018. Our core domestic business 
performed to expectation, contributing to a 
strong underlying cash flow.
We launched our Transformation programme 
in October 2016 with the aim of improving 
competitiveness and our front-line customer 
experience. The programme progressed well in 
2017, with the first major stage of the programme 
being a review of our business processes and 
organisational structure. The implementation 
of new IT systems to underpin the goals of the 
programme is well underway, and we expect 
to see the benefits of this investment coming 
onstream through 2018. Wherever possible, 
we have taken the opportunity to introduce 
proprietary established vendor software  
to replace in-house customised systems  
to improve functionality and efficiency.
Several strategies to pursue new growth were 
established and operational in 2017. As well 
as pursuing opportunities closely aligned 
to our Global Solutions business – such as the 
partnership with China Unicom to facilitate its 
‘CUniq’ service – we were able to explore several 
new opportunities through our Vannin Ventures 
standalone business incubator. In 2017, we 
successfully acquired a 67% shareholding 
in Goshawk Communications, and significant 
progress was made towards our objective of 
launching this service to the wider UK market.

I am very pleased to report a solid performance for 2017. 
The dedication and hard work of our people has been 
outstanding during 2017 and is the reason we have delivered 
a very good result in a period of significant change during 
our Transformation Programme.
ceo’s review
Our core business has 
remained stable, with 
a solid performance in 
Fixed Line, Broadband 
and Data Services, Mobile 
and further growth in our 
Global Solutions business.
Overview
The Company has had a busy 
year operationally, and continues 
to provide a wide range of 
telecommunications services to 
consumers, businesses and the 
public sector on the Isle of Man 
as we continue to demonstrate 
our commitment to the Island 
community. Our core domestic 
business performance in Fixed 
Line, Broadband, Data and Mobile 
remained solid during the year. 
Availability and take-up of high- 
speed broadband services continues 
to increase, and the introduction 
of our Smartroam tariffs has been 
a success, with a positive take-up 
by our post-pay customer base. 
Our 4G network is performing well, 
supporting our significant market 
share of mobile subscribers.
Our International Global Solutions 
business performed well during the 
year, with continued year-on-year 
growth across the majority of the 
product portfolio.
Results overview
Revenue was lower than 2016 due to 
the previously noted consolidation of 
some of our Data Centre customers 
and rescheduling of the directory 
distribution, partially offset by 
continued growth in Global Solutions.
Cash performance in the year has 
been exceptionally strong as a result 
of tight control of our working capital 
and capital expenditure, and 
continues to support our progressive 
dividend policy for 2017.
Underlying EBITDA declined slightly 
to £27.1m (2016: 27.7m). Reported 
EBITDA was up for the year at 
£23.1m (2016: 22.7m) as a result of a 
reduction in the costs relating to the 
Transformation Programme compared 
with 2016 and a lower impairment 
charge for obsolete assets. The cash 
performance triggered the provision 
for incentive payments, resulting in a 
moderately lower underlying EBITDA, 
while decreased revenues were offset 
by cost saving initiatives made 
throughout the year.
Underlying profit after tax decreased 
to £15.1m (2016: £16.3m), as a result 
of a lower underlying EBITDA and 
increased depreciation. Underlying 
diluted earnings per share was 
therefore reduced to 13.15p (2016: 
14.26p). Reported profit after tax 
increased year-on-year to £11.9m 
(2016: £8.8m), primarily due to a 
non-recurring £1.3m loss on the 
revaluation of property costs in

overview strategic report governance report financial statements other
the prior year and a £0.8m profit on 
interest rate swaps (2016: £1.2m loss).
In 2017, the Company continued to 
invest in its infrastructure, specifically 
in the mobile network, increasing 
the availability of our VDSL high 
speed broadband network, and 
in key back office systems as part 
of the Transformation Programme.
Fixed, Broadband and 
Data services
Fixed, Broadband and Data services 
provide fixed line voice, broadband 
and connectivity services for 
customers, connecting approximately 
37,000 homes and 4,000 businesses 
on the Isle of Man. Fixed, Broadband 
and Data is our largest business, 
representing 40% of all company 
revenues. In 2017 revenue was stable, 
at £31.5m (2016: £31.6m).
Take up of our high-speed broadband 
services, known as Ultima and Ultima 
plus, delivered Broadband revenue 
growth of 2.2% during 2017 to £9.3m. 
During 2017 , we commenced our trial 
rollout of our fibre to the premises 
(FTTP) programme, with the first 
businesses and consumers expected 
to be serviced in H1 2018. Our planned 
investment in FTTP for 2018 is included 
in our 2018 capital expenditure 
budget, and is expected to result in 
ARPU accretion as customers upgrade 
to the new service.
In May 2017, we introduced changes 
to our Fixed Line and Broadband Tariff 
Charges. The price changes increased 
fixed line rental charges, but offered 
the opportunity to deliver greater 
value for money to customers who 
subscribe to multiple services.
Mobile
Our Mobile business performed well 
with encouraging revenues following 
successful Christmas promotions 
and well-received additional 
complementary products, offset by 
the anticipated impact on revenues 
from our roaming proposition 
(Smartroam). In August 2017, we 
launched inclusive roaming usage 
for our post-pay customers, and 
reduced roaming rates to all our 
mobile customers; a first for the Isle 
of Man market. These price reductions 
were supported by improved cost 
control and have proved popular with 
our customer base.
Our award-winning 4G network, which 
provides 99% population coverage at 
speeds of up to ten times faster than 
3G services, continues to perform well 
and enable us to defend our mobile 
subscribers market share.
Data Centre

three data centres at Douglas North, 
Douglas Central and Greenhill Data 
Centre (‘GDC’). The data centres at 
GDC and Douglas North are Tier 3 
designed data centres providing high 
standards of data security, resilience, 
and expandable hosting capacity, 
including business continuity and 
distributed denial of service 
protection (‘DDoS’).
Following a decline in Data Centre 
revenue last year due to customer 
consolidation, it is good to see 
underlying growth for the year. 
H2 saw improved performance, 
with revenues up 4.9% compared 
with H1. This growth was primarily 
due to recurring revenues from  
a good uptake of our intelligent  
cloud services and from some 
non-recurring sales. We continue  
to be responsive in seeking to 
re-populate capacity in our data 
centres, with a focus on managed 
service business, to better  
utilise our investment, as well  
as through new complimentary 
product offerings.
Global Solutions
The Global Solutions business 
generates revenue from services 
which run on our domestic mobile 
technology platform and utilise our 
international roaming agreements. 
This enables us to offer a variety of 
products to UK and international 
partners who use our Global  
Solutions SIM cards. There are  
four key revenue areas: wholesale  
SMS and voice, international traveller 
market, M2M and strongest signal 
mobile (branded ‘Chameleon’).
Global Solutions continues to perform 
well with increased year on year 
revenues, up 6.2% during the year 
to £16.5m (2016: £15.6m), with most 
of the product portfolio enjoying 
growth, in particular M2M and the 
international traveller market.
In 2016, we signed an agreement 
with China Unicom Global Limited, 
a subsidiary of China Unicom Group, 
the world’s fourth largest mobile 
service provider by subscriber base, 
to provide the connectivity to facilitate 
China Unicom’s ‘CUniq’ UK mobile 
and roaming product. Whilst there 
were some delays in the project in the 
first half of 2017 (as explained at the 
half year), the partnership performed 
better in H2. We remain excited about 
the potential of this collaboration and 
other growth opportunities for the 
Global Solutions business in 2018.
Other revenues
Other revenues include the advertising 
revenue from our telephone 
directory, hardware equipment sales, 
interconnection fees and managed 
services. Other revenue also includes 
our revenues from our standalone 
business, Vannin Ventures and 
its subsidiaries.
Other revenue decreased in line with 
management’s expectations by 23% 
during the year to £5.9m (2016: £7 .6m) 
due to the rescheduling of the directory 
distribution and lower kit sales.
In August 2016, we launched Vannin 
Ventures, a standalone business 
established to support the Company’s 
long-term growth strategy. Wholly 
owned by Manx Telecom, its purpose 
is to identify new and promising 
business opportunities in the telecoms 
and technology sectors, acting 
as an incubator to bring innovative 
products and services to market. 
There is a dedicated team behind 
the new business with a view to 
fostering a creative environment 
and an entrepreneurial ethos.
The acquisition of Partitionware, 
an Isle of Man software developer 
specialising in telecommunication 
platforms, at the end of 2016 has 
proven successful, with Partitionware 
supporting Vannin Ventures 
throughout the year as it seeks to 
acquire new businesses in line with 
our transformational growth strategy.
In May 2017, the Group acquired a 67% 
interest in Goshawk Communications 
UK Limited (‘Goshawk’). Goshawk is 
a UK-based company which develops 
and exploits technology-based 
solutions that enhance audio quality. 
Goshawk was acquired in order to 
support the Group’s growth strategy 
by developing disruptive technologies 
and bringing innovative products 
and services to the market.
Transformation Programme
In October 2016, the Company 
launched a two-year programme 
aimed at improving the experience 
it delivers to customers.
Vannin Ventures, our business incubator, has successfully 
integrated Partitionware following its acquisition in 
December 2016, and has acquired a majority stake 
in Goshawk Communications, a provider of technology 
for those with hearing loss, bringing exciting growth 
potential in the medium term. 19

CEO in touch with the business
The programme progressed well 
in 2017 with the introduction of new 
IT systems supporting improvements 
in processes and organisational 
structure. We are still on track to incur 
exceptional costs of approximately 
£10m over a 24-month period with 
£8.2m recognised up to the year end 
(2017: £3.9m, 2016: £4.3m), in addition, 
capital expenditure of £3.2m has been 
incurred to date (2017: £3.2m, 2016: nil) 
over the course of the programme. 
The cash cost of the programme 
in 2017 was £8.9m (2016: £0.5m).
We remain confident in 
the outlook for the Group, 
which is reflected in the 
maintenance of our 
progressive dividend policy. 
The strong underlying 
cashflow performance 
during the year reflects our 
focus on working capital 
and control over capital 
expenditure, and enables 
us to create value for our 
shareholders and invest in 
our network infrastructure 
in the Isle of Man.”

maximising 
mobile value 
and market share
In August 2017 we became the first and only 
local operator to offer consumers inclusive 
UK and EU roaming allowances, helping 
retain and deliver excellent value to our 
mobile users.
Offering bundled roaming 
allowances is accepted 
practice for EU operators 
and their customers, but 
much more demanding 
for operators such as 
Manx Telecom which 
sit outside the EU.
Indeed, wholesale roaming rates 
made it especially challenging 
to deliver the value we knew our 
customers craved, alongside an 
acceptable margin. At the end 
of an 18-month period, leveraging 
over 400 roaming agreements and 
ensuring our IT and billing systems 
were adapted to fulfil the new 
requirements, we launched our 
‘Smartroam’ tariffs, providing more 
freedom for our customers to use 
their mobile in the UK and across 
EU without having to worry so much 
about roaming charges.
With four levels of tariffs to choose 
from, maximum value is achieved 
by those customers opting for our 
‘Smartroam Unlimited’ tariff – the 
Isle of Man’s first truly unlimited 
on-island tariff for minutes, texts and 
data usage, in addition to allowances 
of 500 minutes, 500 texts and 5GB 
of UK and EU inclusive roaming.
The response was hugely positive. 
Many of our customers switched to 
an equivalent or higher cost monthly 
Smartroam tariff to date, retaining 
their loyalty for up to 24-month terms, 
and upgrading to the new benefits.
Following the success of our consumer 
Smartroam proposition, a corporate 
equivalent was launched in Q1 2018, 
including the additional benefit of 
shared allowances across multiple users. 22

Transforming for 
a future-proof 
customer experience
Following the launch of our Transformation 
Programme, several supporting workstreams 
ran throughout 2017 with the overall 
objective of delivering outstanding internal 
and external customer experience.
Driven by changes  
in customer demands,  
new disruptive 
competition and 
technology, and the 
continual need to  
invest in our people, 
working environments,  
IT systems and processes, 
our Transformation 
Programme is quite  
simply the largest  
change programme  
in the Company’s  
128-year history.
A significant slice of the 
transformation budget was allocated 
to IT projects that, from 2017 through 
to mid-2018, will serve to replace 
legacy in-house platforms with 
proprietary ‘as-a-service’ alternatives. 
This will deliver a new ‘systems 
architecture’ with enhanced scalability, 
self-serve functionality and flexible 
integration with other applications.
Headcount was reduced in Q1 2017 
by nearly 15% following a carefully 
considered voluntary redundancy 
programme that will deliver net cost 
savings from 2018 onwards. Our 
ageing vehicle fleet was refreshed, 
changing from an outright ownership 
model to a new leased agreement, 
also delivering more fuel-efficiency 
and fewer environmental emissions. 
Working spaces have also been 
re-designed to be more modern, 
open and productive – the first being 
completed in December 2017 for our 
Customer Experience Team.
Most importantly, we have defined 
new target operating models 
for key functions that define a 
Manx Telecom that is more agile, 
creative and effective in its ability 
to rapidly take advantage of market 
opportunities and deliver a superior 
customer experience.
The Transformation Programme 
is due to complete in 2018 and 
transition towards an Operational 
Excellence function – supported by 
a new in-house team – that will deliver 
continuous improvement across the 
Company thereafter. 24

Award-winning 
and life-changing 
help for millions 
with hearing loss
 
A majority shareholding in Goshawk 
Communications is now primed for 
penetrating new growth markets 
amongst 1 in 6 hearing loss sufferers.
In May 2017, Vannin 
Ventures – the growth 
incubating wholly-owned 
subsidiary of Manx Telecom 
– acquired a 67% 
shareholding in a new 
Isle of Man company, 
Goshawk Communications 
Limited, that will provide 
pioneering technology to 
help mobile phone users 
with hearing loss.
In the UK alone, nine million people 
experience varying degrees of hearing 
loss, affecting their ability to use voice 
services on mobile phones. Using 
personalised auditory profiles that are 
created for each user, the new company 
combines intellectual property with 
the commercial and technological 
capability of Vannin Ventures.
Clinical trials conducted over the 
last 24 months have shown that the 
technology can have a transformative 
effect in improving communication for 
those suffering from hearing loss. One 
trialist said “It changed my life, I was 
no longer afraid to use the phone.”
Goshawk Communications Limited
CEO Matthew Turner said: “We are 
really proud to see our technology 
become part of something that has 
all the ingredients and potential to 
improve the lives of millions of global 
users. As a hearing impaired person 
myself, I am passionate about the 
benefits this technology can bring. 
I am particularly impressed with 
the Isle of Man as an international 
business centre, and look forward  
to the future success of this venture.”
In November, the new company 
was recognised at The Isle of Man 
Newspapers Awards for Excellence as 
winner in the category of ‘Excellence 
in the use of Technology’.

Revenues resulted in £78.5m for the year (2016: £80.8m).  
In underlying terms, our EBITDA was £27.1m (2016: £27.7m) 
and our profit after tax was down 7.4% to £15.1m. After 
our Transformation Programme and after other charges, 
our reported profit after tax was £11.9m (2016: £8.8m).
financial review
The Fixed Line, Broadband and Data 
business continues to perform solidly, 
with a small decrease in revenue of 
0.5% to £31.5m (2016: £31.6m). As 
expected, the Data Centre business 
saw a decrease in revenue to £4.7m 
(2016: £5.9m), due to the previously 
reported consolidation and from 
lower kit sales than in previous years.
Mobile revenues declined as expected 
to £19.9m (2016: £20.2m) due to a 
reduction in retail roaming revenues 
resulting from the introduction of 
our Smartroam tariffs. Smartroam is 
our roaming proposition in response 
to the changes to EU Roaming 
regulations. Excluding retail roaming, 
Mobile revenues were up 3.1%.
Global Solutions performed well,  
with full year revenue of £16.5m (2016: 
£15.6m), a 6.2% increase year-on-year, 
driven by continuous growth in our 
Strongest Signal Mobile solution 
(branded Chameleon), M2M, and 
international traveller propositions.
Other revenues declined by 23% to 
£5.9m (2016: £7.6m), back in line with 
2015 levels due to the rescheduling of 
our directory distribution and one-off 
revenues for hardware equipment 
sales which have not repeated.
The Group generated £27.1m of 
underlying EBITDA (2016: £27.7m) 
which was marginally lower year-on-
year due to certain incentive payments 
being triggered by the Group’s 
excellent cash conversion. Reported 
EBITDA for the year was £23.1m 
(2016: £22.7m). The Group’s underlying 
EBITDA margin was slightly higher 
at 34.5% (2016: 34.2%), as reduced 
revenue was offset by a reduction 
in costs across the business.
Depreciation and amortisation 
increased in the year to £9.7m 
(2016: £9.1m), impacted by prior-year 
investment in billing platforms with 
shorter economic lives.
Underlying operating profit declined 
to £17.4m (2016: £18.5m) as a result 
of an increase in depreciation and 
amortisation and lower underlying 
EBITDA. Reported operating profit 
was £13.4m (2016: £13.6m).
Reported profit before tax increased 
from the prior year to £11.9m (2016: 
£8.8m) due to favourable movements 
on interest swaps in 2016, including  
a £1.3m loss on revaluation of 
properties. Underlying profit before 
tax decreased to £15.1m (2016: £16.3m) 
as a result of decreased underlying 
EBITDA and increased depreciation.

Underlying diluted EPS was lower at 
13.15p (2016: 14.26p). Reported diluted 
EPS was 10.40p (2016: 7.72p).
The Company paid an interim 
dividend of 3.9p per share in October 
2017 and declared a final dividend for 
2017 of 7.5p per share on 15 March 
2018, resulting in a full year dividend 
for 2017 of 11.4p per share, a 4.6% 
increase from 2016.
Costs
Reduced Cost of Sales and 
Administrative expenses in the 
year contributed to an improved 
underlying EBITDA margin, from 
34.2% to 34.5%.
Energy costs were down 9% during 
2017 due to a full year of customer 
consolidation in our Data Centre 
business. Mobile handset costs were 
up 16% due to successful Christmas 
promotions and the introduction of 
Smartroam, supporting an increase 
in post-paid contract subscribers and 
upsell of customers on legacy tariffs 
to the new Smartroam tariffs.
Administrative expenses decreased 
by 3.7% to £33.7m (2016: £35.0m), 
as a result of cost saving initiatives 
throughout the year, offset in part by 
increased depreciation. Administrative 
expenses excluding depreciation were 
down 7.1%. The main component of 
administrative costs is staff, the cost 
of which decreased by 2.2% in the 
period. This was partly as a result of 
the reduction in costs for part of the 
year after voluntary redundancies 
under the Transformation Programme.
Net finance costs
Net finance costs increased to 
£2.4m (2016: £2.3m). Included in this 
figure is the cost of interest at £2.0m 
(2016: £2.1m).
We recorded an unrealised gain of 
£0.8m on interest rate swaps (2016: 
£1.2m loss), resulting from changes 
in market interest rates. No swaps
have been exited during the year, 
therefore there are no realised gains 
or losses. This charge does not form 
part of the underlying results and has
no impact on cash.
Taxation
There is no corporate taxation payable 
on our profits for either 2017 or the 
comparative year. We have the benefit 
of an Isle of Man 0% corporate tax rate.
The main component of 
administrative costs is staff, 
the cost of which decreased 
by 2.2% in the period. This

Cash flow
Underlying cash flow from operations 
increased by 17.3% to £26.5m (2016: 
£22.6m) due to tight control of 
working capital. Reported cash flow
from operations decreased by 8.8% 
from £22.0m to £20.0m.
Underlying free cash flow, which 
excludes Transformation Programme 
cash outflows of £8.9m (2016: £0.5m) 
and acquisition cash outflows of 
£2.0m (2016: £1.8m), was up 22.1% at 
£20.0m (2016: £16.4m). Reported free 
cash flow decreased to £9.1m (2016: 
£14.1m), primarily as a result of the 
restructuring costs associated with 
the Transformation Programme paid 
during the year.
Capital expenditure
Capital expenditure in 2017, including 
intangibles, was £8.6m (2016: £6.7m), 
of which a significant portion (£3.2m) 
was related to the Transformation 
Programme, including £2.0m of 
improvements to our information 
systems and £0.7m of property 
renovation costs. Of the remainder, 
we invested £0.7m in our broadband 
network to increase the reach of our 
VDSL high‐speed broadband, and a 
further £0.7m in our mobile network. 
The remaining capital expenditure 
was spread across a number of 
business areas, including network 
development for our Global
Solutions products, off‐island 
connectivity, and a Data Centre 
maintenance capital spend.
Balance sheet
Property, plant and equipment 
decreased during the year by £1.0m 
to £59.3m (2016: £60.3m). Capital 
additions were £8.5m (2016: £6.7m), 
as described above. Depreciation 
increased to £9.4m (2016: £8.9m) due 
to prior year investment in billing 
platforms with shorter economic lives.
We retain goodwill of £87.9m on the 
balance sheet; £84.3m arising from 
the purchase of Manx Telecom from 
Telefónica in 2010, and £3.6m from 
the purchase of Partitionware Limited 
in 2016, both of which are robustly 
supported by current valuations.
The Group operates two pension 
schemes, a defined benefit scheme, 
and a defined contribution plan. 
During 2014 the defined benefit 
scheme was closed to future accruals, 
and all current members transferred 
to a defined contributions scheme. In 
2016, the Group completed a triennial 
revaluation of the scheme and, as 
part of this process, agreed reduced 
annual funding obligations to the 
scheme for 2017 onwards, down from 
£1.2m per annum to £0.6m per annum. 
Under accounting standard IAS 19, the 
defined benefit scheme is shown as 
a net liability of £3.8m (2016: £5.4m 
net liability); there was a 5.5% return 
on scheme assets during the period. 
Scheme liabilities decreased by £0.4m, 
mainly due to a decrease in the 
discount rate tied to deteriorating 
corporate bond yields.
Current assets increased to £41.7m 
(2016: £40.8m). Cash held at the 
end of the period decreased to 
£12.3m (2016: £16.7m) following 
£8.5m of payments in relation to 
the Transformation Programme, 
offset by tight working capital and 
capital expenditure. Trade and other 
receivables increased by £5.4m, of 
which other receivables increased 
by £3.2m, due to an increase 
in roaming discount receivables 
compared to the prior year. A large 
outstanding amount of the roaming 
discount receivables was settled 
in January 2018.
Current liabilities increased to £30.9m 
(2016: £30.6m), due to an increase in 
trade payables of £3.3m and £0.3m 
of the interest rate swaps the Group 
has entered into that mature within 
12 months of the financial year 
end. These increases were offset 
by £3.3m of provisions against 
the Transformation Programme 
being utilised.
Non‐current liabilities reduced to 
£73.9m (2016: £76.3m) as a result of 
a £1.6m reduction in the net defined 
benefit pension scheme liability and 
a £0.8m reduction in the interest rate 
swap liability. Interest bearing loans 
and borrowings were relatively 
unchanged at £69.3m (2016: £69.0m).
Our loan facility matures on 30 June 
2020. On 28 December 2017, Lloyds 
Bank plc as arranger, novated its 
portion of the loan to DNB Bank 
ASA whilst remaining agent and

The Group has entered into two 
interest rate swaps, one maturing in 
June 2018 and one maturing in June 
2020. As at 31 December 2017, the 
fair value of the interest rate swap 
maturing in June 2018 was a £0.3m 
liability (2016: £0.9m), while fair value 
of the interest rate swap maturing in
June 2020 was a £0.9m liability (2016: 
£1.0m liability). During the year, the 
portion of the swap held with Lloyds 
changed counterparty to DNB
Bank ASA.
Net debt for the year increased 
to £56.9m (2016: £52.4m) as a result 
of the Transformation Programme 
cash outflows of £8.9m paid during 
the year, offset in part by strong 
underlying cash generation. Period 
end Net Debt was equivalent to 2.1x 
underlying EBITDA (2016: 1.9x).
Alternative Performance Measures
The Directors of the Group have 
presented a number of additional 
performance measures which 
they believe are relevant to an 
understanding of the Group’s financial 
performance but which are not defined 
in IFRS and are therefore termed 
‘non-GAAP’ measures. The Group’s 
definition of these terms may not 
be comparable with similarly titled 
performance measures and disclosures 
by other entities. Such non-GAAP 
measures should not be viewed in 
isolation or as an alternative to the 
equivalent GAAP measure.
Reconciliations from these non 
GAAP measures to the most 
directly comparable IFRS measure 
have been provided within this 
Financial Review and within note 
29 of Financial Statements.

Our risk management process aims to support the 
delivery of the Board’s strategy by managing the risk 
of failing to achieve our business objectives.
risk management 
approach
Trading Ltd, reviews summary reports 
based on the information submitted 
by the operational and functional leads 
from each area, each of whom perform 
a detailed risk review exercise and 
update the Group risk register. 
The register ensures consistency of 
approach in reporting of risks and 
requires management to:
 – identify and classify each risk as 
financial, operational or strategic;
 – assess the inherent risk impact and 
likelihood;
 – identify mitigation measures;
 – allocate an owner who has 
responsibility for the timely 
implementation of the agreed action 
plan; and
 – report on implementation of 
strategies to address residual  
risk exposures.
Principal risks
We acknowledge that our processes 
can only provide reasonable assurance 
that the principal risks facing the 
business are identified and that we can 
subsequently manage these risks so 
that any potential impacts are reduced 
appropriately. We recognise that we 
cannot guarantee that all risks are 
identified, or that the nature of 
identified risks will remain constant.
The main focus of the Board is on 
ensuring that the response to the 
key risks is appropriate and ensuring 
that the Group’s residual risk position 
is within its risk appetite.
Risk management & principal risks
Our risk management process aims 
to support the delivery of the Board’s 
strategy by managing the risk of failing 
to achieve our business objectives. By 
focusing our risk management system 
on the early identification of key risks, 
we are able to consider the existing 
level of mitigation and the management 
actions required to avoid, reduce, 
tolerate or share the risk. Where the 
reduction or removal of the risk is not 
possible, the Group formulates a 
management action plan to respond to 
the risk should the risk materialise (e.g. 
the Business Continuity Plan). The Board 
agrees the appetite for risk, and 
endorses that of the Executive Team.
While the Board has the ultimate 
responsibility, the Audit Committee, 
as described in the Audit Committee 
Report, is charged with ensuring that 
appropriate measures are in place to 
validate the strength of internal controls.
Ongoing monitoring
The Board performs regular reviews of 
the most significant risks, with interim 
updates from management if significant 
issues arise. It evaluates key areas of risk 
through a series of presentations from 
management and functional leads on 
matters most relevant to the organisation 
e.g. regulation, pensions, cyber-attacks 
and information security, technology and 
the competitive environment.
The quality and consistency of risk 
reporting is supported through a 
number of other monitoring and 
reporting processes including:
 – annual group strategy process and 
Board presentations;
 – monthly Chief Executive business 
review reports of key financial and 
operational performance levels 
within each area of the business; and
 – monthly detailed finance reviews.
Group Operating Executive and 
Senior Leadership Team
There are also defined roles within 
the process for the Group Operating 
Executive and the Group Senior 
Leadership Team.

robust control framework, with 
reviews performed by management. 
The result is high levels of assurance 
over internal controls, including the 
financial reporting process and 
financial and general IT controls.
Management oversight
Risk management activities of 
management, which includes 
controls self-assessment, are 
supplemented by the oversight of 
the control framework by the Board 
and committees of the Board.

principal risks
Operational
The Board has identified the following 
as the principal operational risks the 
Group faces.
Risk
Underlying 
risk level Impact Mitigation Changes in the year
Cyber Increasing The nature of our network 
and infrastructure creates a risk 
of cyber threat and telephony 
fraud. In the event of breaches 
in our information security 
systems from cyber-attacks, 
the impact is likely to be felt 
beyond any initial revenue 
loss. It is also likely to extend 
to reputational damage and 
a loss of customer confidence, 
with the attendant impact on 
future business.
The cyber strategy places 
significant emphasis on 
information security systems 
and mitigating the risk of 
cyber-attacks and other 
threats to confidential data.
We have continued to 
implement a programme of 
information security measures 
and controls to mitigate the 
threat of cyber attacks and 
other threats to data. In 
particular, a number of cloud 
based technologies have  
been implemented during  
the year, each with their  
own security arrangements.
Our ISO27001:2013 certification 
was also re-validated during 
the year. A number of security 
technical controls (part of our 
cyber security programme) will 
be delivered during Q1 2018.
Technology Stable The market in which the Group 
operates creates a high reliance 
on technology for the provision 
of services to our customers. In 
the event that elements of the 
service provision fail as a result 
of failures in our network, it is 
likely to be impacted by initial 
revenue loss, which is likely 
to extend to reputational 
damage and loss of customer 
confidence, with the attendant 
impact on future business.
The technology strategy 
focuses on network resilience, 
future-proofing wherever 
possible, decreasing the 
dependency on a single 
supplier, and the use of ‘off 
the shelf’ technologies rather 
than bespoke solutions.
Further investment has been 
made during the year, directed 
towards meeting the objectives 
of the IT Transformation 
project, continuing the  
trend of reducing key  
supplier and bespoke 
technology dependency.
The ongoing IT Transformation 
delivered some key functionality 
and business benefits towards 
the end of 2017 . The remainder 
of the IT Transformation 
function and benefits will 
land during 2018.
Pension 
fund
Stable The Group supports a defined 
benefit pension scheme for 
some employees. Changes 
to investment returns  
and actuarial assumptions 
could cause an increase in 
funding requirements.
Regular review of the Scheme’s 
funding strategy provides an 
opportunity to ensure that the 
Scheme operates efficiently, 
and that any issues that arise 
can be addressed in a timely 
manner. The Trustees are 
provided with support to 
ensure that the Scheme 
continues to deliver the 
necessary returns to fund 
its ongoing liabilities.
After a detailed review of the 
Scheme’s investment strategy 
during 2016, undertaken 
by external consultants and 
supported by the Group, the 
recommended strategy was 
implemented during Q3 2017.
The new strategy aims to 
further reduce exposure 
to equity market risks. 33
manx telecom plc 
annual report and accounts 2017
overview strategic report governance report financial statements other
Commercial and strategic
The Board has identified the following 
as the principal commercial and strategic 
risks the Group faces.
Risk
Underlying 
risk level Impact Mitigation Changes in the year
Regulation Stable Manx Telecom operates under 
a licence from the Isle of Man 
Communications Commission, 
which regulates the telecoms 
market on the Island. An 
adverse change to our licence 
or in the focus of regulation 
remains a principal risk to 
the business.
We remain committed to open 
dialogue and transparent 
reporting with the regulator 
so that we can work to  
support the continuing  
growth of the economy.
We provide the regulator with 
annual separated accounts 
based on a bottom-up cost 
model that was developed 
with the assistance of an 
independent consultant and 
ensures that they have a proper 
assessment of our portfolio 
pricing and margins.
The regulatory environment 
has not changed significantly 
during the year.
The Director of the 
Communications Commission 
stepped down. A replacement 
is being sought.
Competition Stable Competition in the domestic 
and wider markets has the 
potential to significantly 
impact our revenue streams.
The Group regularly 
benchmarks product pricing 
against domestic competition, 
and against other markets, 
to ensure that our strategy 
remains effective.
We also recognise the 
importance of key customers 
to our business and apply 
ourselves to developing 
relationships to ensure that we 
can understand and support 
their strategic objectives.
Our principal competitors have 
continued to focus their efforts 
on gaining market share through 
pricing. Expansion to our 
network and products, including 
the introduction of Vectoring 
and VPlus to our DSL portfolio 
and new Carrier Ethernet 
Services during the year.
These developments, along with 
the continued Transformation 
Programme, reinforce the Group 
strategy of focusing on customer 
service and value-added 
propositions across the portfolio 
of our products, enabling us to 
maintain market share and build 
customer loyalty, rather than 
trying to compete purely on price.
Legislative 
Change
Stable Current corporate tax 
arrangements make the Isle 
of Man an attractive economy 
in which to invest and do 
business. The Group benefits 
from this environment both 
directly, from the 0% corporate 
tax rate, and from the wider 
economic benefit that arises 
from a growing economy. 
Significant changes to 
legislation both on the Isle of 
Man and further afield could 
result in a deterioration of 
the economy.
The Group has limited 
opportunity to directly 
influence Government policy 
or legislation, although we 
communicate our position 
through regular discussion with 
members of the legislature.
The principal legislation 
affecting the Group has 
not changed. However,  
a new Telecommunications 
Bill is making its way  
through legislative process 
following consultation.
Brexit has generated some 
discussion around possible 
changes to corporation tax  
in the UK and perhaps in the 
Isle of Man. We continue to 
monitor developments. 34
manx telecom plc

Communities on 
the Isle of Man share 
a heightened sense 
of national pride 
and ‘belonging’  
that binds us all 
tightly together .
For over 125 years, Manx Telecom 
has played and continues to play a 
role in making this happen every day, 
not just through telecommunications, 
but also through a wide range of 
activities, charitable donations and 
sponsorships. Wherever possible, 
we use our technology – and our 
skills and expertise in deploying it – 
to underpin and shape our support 
for the community.
In total, in 2017 over 40 organisations 
benefitted from over £100,000 of 
our support – here are just some 
that make us particularly proud  
to be ‘Manx’.

those expressed or implied by these forward-looking 
statements and forecasts. Nothing in this Annual Report  
to shareholders should be construed as a profit forecast.

Isle of Man Companies Act 2006) in respect of any liabilities

Restrictions on the transfer of shares and voting rights 
attaching to shares
There are no restrictions on the transfer of the ordinary 
shares other than:
 – awards made at Admission under the co-investment plan 
are conditional upon there being only limited disposals 
by the participants of their own investment shares;
 – where, from time to time, certain restrictions may 
become imposed by laws and regulations (for example, 
insider trading laws); and
 – pursuant to the Listing Rules of the Financial Conduct 
Authority whereby certain directors, officers and 
employees of the Company require the approval of the 
Company to deal in the ordinary shares.
No shareholder holds securities carrying special rights as  
to the control of the Company. There are no limitations on 
the holding of securities. There are no restrictions on voting 
rights or any arrangements by which, with the Company’s 
cooperation, financial rights carried by securities are held 
by a person other than the holder of the securities. There 
are no agreements between holders of securities that are 
known to the Company which may result in restrictions 
on the transfer of voting rights.
Authority to purchase own shares
The Directors have been authorised to purchase up 
to 10% of the Company’s issued ordinary share capital 
as at the Annual General Meeting held on 14 June 2017. 
This authority will expire at the Annual General Meeting 
in 2018 at which a resolution to renew the authority for 
a further year will be proposed. Further to the shareholders 
resolution dated 15 June 2016, the Company purchased 
29,670 ordinary shares with a nominal value of £59 and 
representing 0.03% of the Company’s called up ordinary 
share capital, for a consideration of £58,451. The reason 
for the purchase was to satisfy employee bonus awards  
and as such all shares were immediately transferred.
As at 31 December 2017 and 25 April 2018, being the  
latest practicable date prior to the publication of this  
report, the Company did not hold any shares in treasury.
Appointment and replacement of directors
Unless determined by ordinary resolution of the 
Company, the number of directors shall not be less than 
two. A director is not required to hold any shares in the 
Company by way of qualification.
The Board may appoint any person to be a director and 
such director shall hold office only until the next AGM,  
when he or she shall be eligible for appointment by the 
shareholders. The Articles provide that at each AGM, one 
third of the Directors for the time being (or, if their number 
is not a multiple of three, then the number nearest to but 
not exceeding one third) shall retire from office. A director 
who retires at any AGM shall be eligible for reappointment. 
In addition, any director appointed by the Board shall hold 
office only until the next following AGM and shall then be 
eligible for appointment.
Articles of Association
The Articles of Association (‘Articles’), adopted on 
3 February 2014, may only be amended by special resolution 
of the shareholders. A copy of the Articles is available 
on request from the Company Secretary.
Share capital: structure, rights and restrictions
Details of the Company’s share capital are set out in note 
17 to the financial statements on pages 91 and 92. The 
Company has a single class of share capital divided into 
114,847,637 ordinary shares of £0.002 each. The rights and 
obligations attaching to these shares are governed by Isle 
of Man law and the Company’s Articles.
Voting rights attaching to shares
Ordinary shareholders are entitled to receive notice and to 
attend and speak at any general meeting of the Company. 
On a show of hands every shareholder present in person 
or by proxy (or being a corporation represented by a duly 
authorised representative) shall have one vote, and on a poll 
every shareholder who is present in person or by proxy shall 
have one vote for every share of which he is the holder. The 
Notice of Annual General Meeting specifies deadlines for 
exercising voting rights and appointing a proxy or proxies.
Deadlines for exercising voting rights attaching 
to shares
The Articles provide a deadline for the submission of proxy 
forms (whether by an instrument in writing or electronically) 
of not less than 48 hours before the time appointed for the 
holding of the meeting or the adjourned meeting.
Shares in uncertificated form
Directors may determine that shares may be held in 
uncertificated form and title to such shares may be 
transferred by means of a relevant system, or that shares 
should cease to be so held and transferred.
Variation of rights attaching to shares
The Articles provide that rights attached to any class of 
shares may be varied with the written consent of the holders 
of not less than three quarters in nominal value of the issued 
shares, or with the sanction of a special resolution passed at 
a separate general meeting of the holders of those shares. 
At every such separate general meeting, the quorum shall 
be two persons holding or representing by proxy at least 
one third in nominal value of the issued shares (calculated 
excluding any shares held in treasury). The rights conferred 
upon the holders of any shares shall not, unless otherwise 
expressly provided in the rights attaching to those shares, 
be deemed to be varied by the creation or issue of further 
shares ranking pari passu with them. 41

Power of directors
Subject to the Articles, the Isle of Man Companies Act 2006 
and any directions given by special resolution, the business 
of the Company shall be managed by the Board, which may 
exercise all the powers of the Company to, for example: 
borrow money, mortgage or charge any of its undertakings, 
property and uncalled capital; and issue debentures and 
other securities, whether outright or as collateral security 
for any debt, liability or obligation of the Company.
Political donations
The Company has made no political donations during the 
year and intends to continue its policy of not doing so for 
the foreseeable future.
Post-balance sheet events
Post-balance sheet events are set out in note 28 to the 
financial statements on page 106.
Major interests in shares
As at 25 April 2018, the Company had been advised, in 
accordance with the Disclosure and Transparency Rules of 
the Financial Conduct Authority, of the following notifiable 
interests (whether directly or indirectly held) in 3% or more 
of its voting rights:
%
Standard Life Aberdeen Limited 16.92
AXA Investment Managers UK Limited 6.46
Unicorn Asset Management Limited 5.54
Hargreave Hale Limited 3.56
Number of securities in issue – 114,847,637. AIM securities 
not in public hands – 17.55%.
Going concern
After making enquiries, the Directors have a reasonable 
expectation that the Group has adequate resources 
to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable 
future. In making this assessment they have considered the 
Company and Group budgets, and cash flow forecasts for 
the period to December 2019. The Group has considerable 
financial resources, minimal liquidity risk and is operating 
within a sector that is experiencing relatively stable demand 
for its products. The Directors therefore have a reasonable 
expectation that the Company and the Group have 
adequate resources to continue in operational existence 
for the foreseeable future. Thus they continue to adopt the 
going concern basis of accounting in preparing the annual 
financial statements.
Audit information
Each of the Directors at the date of the approval of this 
report confirms that: so far as he is aware, there is no 
relevant audit information of which the Company’s auditors 
are unaware; and he has taken all the reasonable steps that 
he ought to have taken as a director to make himself aware 
of any relevant audit information and to establish that the 
Company’s auditors are aware of the information.
Registered agent
The registered agent of the Company at 31 December 
2017 was Estera Trust (Isle of Man) Limited, which served 
throughout the year and has continued to date.
Auditors
The auditors, KPMG Audit LLC, have indicated their 
willingness to continue in office and a resolution 
seeking to reappoint them will be proposed at the 
Annual General Meeting.
Annual General Meeting
The Company’s Annual General Meeting will be held at 
the Company’s main office at the Isle of Man Business Park, 
Cooil Road, Braddan, Isle of Man IM99 1HX on 13 June 2018 
at 9am. Details of the meeting venue and the resolutions 
to be proposed are set out in a separate Notice of Meeting.
The Directors’ Report has been approved by the Board 
of Manx Telecom plc.

Dear Shareholder
Principles of corporate governance
As a Board, we recognise that applying sound governance 
principles in running the Company is essential to provide 
a solid platform for growth and to maintain the trust of 
our stakeholders. The Directors have decided to apply 
the principles set out in the QCA Code, which is a similar 
but simplified version of the UK Corporate Governance 
Code (‘the Code’). The Directors also acknowledge the 
importance of the principles set out in the Code and, 
although adherence to the Code is not compulsory, 
the Directors aim for the Company to apply the Code 
to a greater extent, relative to its size.
The Board
The Board has arranged a schedule of meetings to consider 
strategy, performance and the framework of internal controls. 
We have a Board that has and will support and challenge 
management to deliver its objectives. The Company 
has established Audit, Remuneration and Nomination 
Committees of the Board with formally delegated duties 
and responsibilities. To enable the Board and its committees 
to discharge their duties, all directors receive appropriate 
and timely information. Briefing papers are distributed to all 
directors in advance of Board meetings. All directors have 
access to the advice and services of the Company Secretary, 
who is responsible for ensuring that the Board procedures 
are followed and that applicable rules and regulations are 
complied with.
As Chairman, I would like to state my full commitment to 
maintaining high standards of corporate governance and 
to being transparent about our arrangements.
Kevin Walsh
Chairman
Operation of the Board and its committees
The role of the Board
The Board has an approved Schedule of Matters Reserved 
for the Board which sets out the Board’s responsibilities. 
The key tasks of the Board are:
 – setting the Company’s values and standards;
 – approving of the Group’s strategic aims and objectives;
 – approving of operating and capital expenditure budgets;
 – overseeing operations ensuring adequate systems 
of internal controls and risk management are in place; 
ensuring maintenance of accounting and other records 
and compliance with statutory and regulatory obligations;
 – reviewing performance in light of strategy and budgets 
ensuring any necessary corrective actions are taken; and
 – approving the financial statements, Annual Report 
and Accounts, material contracts and major projects;
 – approving dividend policy;
 – implementing changes to the structure, size and 
composition of the Board;
 – determining remuneration policy for directors and senior 
executives and the remuneration 
of the Non-Executive Directors; and
 – approving communications with shareholders and 
the market.
Composition of the Board
The Board comprises four directors; one is an Executive 
Director and three are Non-Executive Directors, reflecting a 
blend of different experience and backgrounds. Gary Lamb 
and Chris Hall are resident on the Isle of Man. The Chief 
Financial Officer, Paul Tierney, attends Board meetings. 
Details of each of the Directors’ experience and background 
is given in their biographies on page 38.
Appointments to the Board and re-election
Kevin Walsh will stand for re-election at the 2018 Annual 
General Meeting. The process for re-election of directors 
of the Company is governed by its Articles. At each 
Annual General Meeting of the Company, one third of  
the Directors, who are subject to retirement by rotation  
or, if their number is not three or a multiple of three, the 
number nearest to but not exceeding one third, shall retire 
from office. If there are fewer than three directors who are 
subject to retirement by rotation, one director shall retire 
from office. Under the Articles, the Board has the power 
to appoint a director during the year, but any person so 
appointed must stand for election at the next Annual 
General Meeting. 43

Division of responsibilities
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
The division of responsibilities between the Chairman and 
Chief Executive Officer has been agreed by the Board.
Senior Independent Director
The Senior Independent Director is Jeffrey Hume, who is 
available to shareholders as an additional communication 
channel if required.
Non-Executive Directors
The Non-Executive Directors’ letters of appointment set 
out the duties and commitment expected of directors. 
Non-Executive Directors are appointed for an initial 
three-year term with typical expected tenure of two 
three-year terms, subject to re-election by the shareholders. 
They are expected to commit at least 24 days per annum 
to their role. Key elements of a Non-Executive Director’s 
role are:
Strategy – to constructively challenge and develop proposals.
Performance – to scrutinise the performance of 
management in meeting agreed goals and objectives 
and monitor the reporting of performance.
Risk – Non-Executive Directors should satisfy themselves 
on the integrity of financial information and that financial 
controls and systems of risk management are robust.
People – to determine appropriate levels of remuneration 
of Executive Directors and play a prime role in appointing 
Executive Directors and planning succession.
Development, information and support
Directors are encouraged to attend training and continuing 
professional development courses as required. All directors 
have access to company operations and staff.
Sally Lawrence is the Company Secretary and supports 
the Chairman in ensuring that the Board members receive 
the information and support they need in order to carry out 
their roles. She has access to Prism CoSec, the Company’s 
adviser. All directors have access to services of the 
Company Secretary, who is responsible for ensuring  
Board procedures are complied with.
Conflicts of interest
A process has been developed to identify any directors’ 
potential or actual conflicts of interest. This includes 
declaring any new conflicts before the start of each 
Board meeting.
Performance evaluation
An internal performance evaluation of the Board and  
its committees was carried out and the results analysed 
in order to identify areas for improvement. The outcome 
of the review indicated that the Board and its committees 
were effective in carrying out their duties.
Stakeholder engagement
The Company holds scheduled bi-annual meetings with 
analysts and shareholders, in addition to adhoc meetings 
as requested. We also hold a number of meetings each 
year with both members of the Isle of Man Government and 
the regulator (The Communications Commission) in order to 
maintain a constructive dialogue. The Customer Experience 
Team has enhanced engagement with retail customers 
through more surveys, leading to an improvement in service 
provided by the team as described in the strategy in action 
section on page 23.
Board and committee attendance
The number of formal scheduled Board and committee 
meetings held and attended by directors during the year

report of the  
audit committee
Dear Shareholder
I am pleased to set out below an account of our role and 
activities during 2017 and up to the publication of this 
Annual Report.
The primary responsibilities of the Audit Committee are 
to provide effective governance over the appropriateness 
of the Group’s financial reporting including the adequacy 
of related disclosures, the judgement whether the Annual 
Report as a whole is ‘Fair, Balanced and Understandable’, 
the performance of both Internal Audit and the External 
Auditor, and the management of the Group’s systems of 
internal control and business risks.
The Board has ultimate responsibility for determining the 
nature and extent of the significant risks facing the business, 
and for ensuring that risks are managed effectively across 
the Group. Risk management is a regular agenda item 
at Board and Audit Committee meetings and the Board 
considers the impact of the Group’s principal risks in detail 
during the annual Group strategy process. In addition, 
bi-annual Board risk meetings commenced in 2017 to bring 
focus to key risks facing the business.
As part of this the Company has further developed 
its mapping of key risks in terms of gross impact and 
probability together with the residual position after 
mitigation, plus its Risk Assurance mapping including the 
Three Lines of Defence. This is designed to ensure that 
the Board and Audit Committee understand the key risks 
within the business and the methods by which these risks 
are managed.
The Committee will continue with these priorities during 
the following year.
Jeffrey Hume
Chairman of the Audit Committee
Who we are
The Audit Committee consists entirely of independent 
Non-Executive Directors:
 – Jeffrey Hume (Chairman)
 – Kevin Walsh
 – Chris Hall
The Board has determined that Jeffrey Hume has the 
recent and relevant financial experience, which would be 
required under the Corporate Governance Code, to chair 
this Committee. He is also a Fellow of both the Institute of 
Chartered Accountants and the Association of Corporate 
Treasurers. The Committee has relevant Telecoms 
competence as described on page 38 of this annual report.
How we meet
The Committee met three times during 2017, and has 
so far met once in 2018. KPMG Audit LLC, our External 
Auditor, attended each of these meetings as has the 
Company Secretary.
The Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer and 
the Head of Internal Audit also attended Committee 
meetings by invitation. The Committee sought the views 
of the External Auditor and the Head of Internal Audit, 
each without the other or any executives present.
What we have been asked to do
The Board has set Terms of Reference for the Committee 
which require us:
a) to monitor the integrity of the financial statements of 
the Company, including its annual and interim reports;
b) to review and challenge where necessary any changes 
to, and consistency of, accounting policies, whether the 
Company has followed appropriate accounting standards 
and made appropriate estimates and judgements, taking 
into account the views of the External Auditor, the going 
concern assumption, and all material information 
presented with the financial statements;
c) to keep under review the effectiveness of the Company’s 
internal control systems (including financial, operational 
and compliance controls and risk management) and  
to review and approve the statements to be included  
in the Annual Report concerning internal controls and 
risk management;
d) to review the appointment or termination of the Head 
of Internal Audit, the Internal Audit programme and 
monitor and review the effectiveness of the Group’s 
internal audit function;
e) to consider and make recommendations to the Board, 
to be put to shareholders for approval at the Annual 
General Meeting, in relation to the appointment, 
reappointment and removal of the Company’s  
External Auditor;
f) to oversee the relationship with the External Auditor, 
including approval of their remuneration, approval 
of their terms of engagement, assessment annually of 
their independence and objectivity taking into account 
relevant professional and regulatory requirements, and 
the relationship with the auditor as a whole, including the 
provision of any non-audit services; 46
manx telecom plc
annual report and accounts 2017
g) to meet regularly with the External Auditor and, at least once a year, without any Executive Director or other member 
of management present, to discuss any issues arising from the audit;
h) to review and approve the annual external audit plan and review the findings of the audit; and
i) to review the adequacy and security of the Company’s arrangements for its employees and contractors to raise concerns 
in confidence about possible improprieties in financial reporting or other matters, the Company’s procedures for 
detecting fraud and the Company’s anti-bribery procedures.
Key accounting matters
The Committee members reviewed the 2017 Preliminary Results announcement and Annual Report, the 2017 Interim Results 
announcement and reports from the external auditor, KPMG Audit LLC, on the planning for and outcome of their reviews and audit.
We considered key accounting matters in relation to the Group’s financial statements and disclosures. The primary areas 
in relation to the 2017 accounts and how these were addressed:
Key Accounting Matter Audit Committee Response
Revenue
KPMG Audit LLC shared their audit approach in a detailed 
audit plan before commencement of the audit fieldwork, 
which identified the significant risks of misstatement in relation 
to revenue as:
a) presumed risk of fraud; and
b) accuracy of revenue recorded.
This is a recurring key accounting matter.
The Committee is satisfied that the internal control environment 
is appropriately designed and implemented to enforce the 
segregation of duties, supported on an ongoing basis by Internal 
Audit, and to ensure the correct capture of billing events.
We also interrogated management reports on the ageing 
and content of debtor balances and formed a judgement that 
provision levels held against these balances were appropriate.
As a result, the Committee is satisfied with the accuracy and 
appropriateness of the revenue recognised in this Annual Report.
Property Plant and Equipment
Judgements in the timing of assets in the course of construction 
and the determination that expenditure meets the requirements 
for capitalisation as contained in IAS 38.
The Group holds its Land and Buildings on the Statement of Assets 
and Liabilities at Fair Value, being a combination of Market values 
and Value in use. An annual assessment is required to update those 
of the valuations
This is a recurring key accounting matter.
The Committee satisfied itself on the key projects, and in 
particular the IT improvements within the ongoing Transformation 
Programme, that only the appropriate expenditure had been 
capitalised and that depreciation had commenced when the 
assets had been put into use.
We also received and interrogated a management report on 
a comprehensive fixed asset review which had been performed. 
including details of a number of assets which required impairment.
The Committee received and reviewed detailed reporting from 
management setting out the bases for these valuations and 
challenged the appropriateness of the assumptions including 
market movements since the last triennial external valuation, 
the income forecasts utilised for assets held at value-in-use, 
the discount rates then applied and the physical condition 
of those properties.
Defined Benefit Pension Scheme
Whilst the valuation of the Scheme is, for accounting purposes, 
only a small net Retirement benefit liability, the valuation of the 
gross liability is large, complex and involves key assumptions 
as to the future.
This is a recurring key accounting matter.
The Committee noted that the valuation had been performed 
by AON Hewitt using scheme specific assumptions derived by 
it as an independent expert. It also considered the reasons for 
the relatively small changes in assumptions since 2016 and heard 
from KPMG as to its benchmarking against other companies.
The Committee noted that changes made to the scheme during 
the year and in connection with the triennial actuarial valuation had 
increased the matching of assets with liabilities to reduce volatility. 
The exercise had necessitated a greater degree of analysis before 
implementation, giving further comfort.
Consequently, the Committee became satisfied that the scheme 
had been appropriately valued in this Annual Report.
Intercompany Balances
Material intercompany balances are payable to the Parent 
Company from subsidiaries.
This is a recurring key accounting matter.
The Committee is satisfied that the going concern assessment over 
the Group provides sufficient comfort surrounding the 
recoverability of the intercompany balances.
report of the audit committee continued 47
manx telecom plc 
annual report and accounts 2017
overview strategic report governance report financial statements other
In respect of Alternative Performance Measures, the Committee carefully examined and agreed the case for and means of 
publishing underlying profitability results. In particular it focussed on the treatment of expenditure under the Transformation 
Programme including its timing and materiality.
Corporate Governance
The Board asked the Committee to formally consider whether the Annual Report, taken as a whole, is fair, balanced and 
understandable, and also that it provides the information necessary for shareholders to assess the Company’s position and 
performance, business model and strategy.
Committee members were provided with a draft copy of the Annual Report early in the drafting process in order to assess 
the broad direction and key messages being communicated. Committee members provided feedback highlighting any 
areas where they believed further clarity was required. This feedback was incorporated into the draft report provided to the 
Audit Committee meeting for final comment and approval and the External Auditor was given an opportunity to comment. 
The Committee was able to give the Board the requested assurance.
External audit
The effectiveness of the external audit process is dependent on appropriate audit risk identification at the start of the 
audit cycle. We received from KPMG Audit LLC a proposed audit plan which identified their assessment of the key risks. 
The audit plan set out the scope of the audit, areas to be targeted and the audit timetable. This plan was reviewed and 
agreed in advance by the Audit Committee and KPMG Audit LLC and subsequently presented their report on their findings 
to the Audit Committee for discussion.
The Audit Committee monitored the relationship with KPMG Audit LLC to ensure that auditor independence and 
objectivity were maintained. Our assessment was primarily based upon the reports we received, how our challenges were 
met, the enquiries we made into their work, and the insights they were able to contribute. We also received feedback from 
the management team. As part of its review, the Committee monitored the provision of non-audit services by KPMG Audit 
LLC, which were small in comparison to the audit fee.
Having reviewed the auditor’s independence and performance, the Audit Committee is recommending that KPMG Audit 
LLC be reappointed as the Company’s auditor at the 2018 Annual General Meeting.
Internal Audit
The Audit Committee monitored and reviewed the scope, extent and effectiveness of the activity of Internal Audit. 
Reports from Internal Audit routinely include updates on audit activities, progress on the audit plan, management action 
plans to address areas requiring improvement, and the changing resource requirements of the Internal Audit department. 
The Committee discussed the implications of these reports with management and ensured that the recommendations and 
agreed actions received proper focus. The Committee Chairman oversaw the recruitment of a new Head of Internal Audit 
and Revenue Assurance.
Internal controls and risk management
The Company has in place a system of internal financial controls appropriate to its current size and activities, which 
is designed to ensure that the possibility of misstatement or loss is kept to a minimum. A suite of internal policies and 
procedures has been compiled and is subject to continuous review and amendment. These procedures include the 
preparation of management accounts, forecast variance analyses, and other ad hoc reports. There are clearly defined 
authority limits throughout the Group, including those matters which are reserved specifically for the Board. These are 
reviewed by the Board on an annual basis. Risks throughout the Group are considered and reviewed on a regular basis. 
Risks are identified and mitigating actions put into place as appropriate. The principal risks identified are set out in the 
Strategic Report on pages 30 to 33.
Further governance
The Committee conducted a formal evaluation of its effectiveness including taking the views of management and the 
external auditors. All members of the Board participated and it was determined that the Audit Committee has been effective 
in performing its duties as determined by the Terms of Reference. 48

directors’ remuneration 
report
Chairman’s statement
On behalf of the Board, I am pleased to present the 
Directors’ Remuneration Report for the year ended 
31 December 2017. This is my first time of writing to you 
as Chair of the Remuneration Committee, having taken 
over from Kevin Walsh on 1 June 2017.
This report is divided into two parts: the first describes 
our directors’ remuneration policy, and the second 
describes how we intend to implement our policy for  
2018 and, separately, the basis for the remuneration  
paid to directors in respect of 2017. We will once again  
be submitting the report for shareholder approval at this 
year’s Annual General Meeting, via an advisory resolution, 
to ensure that there is accountability to shareholders for 
the policy and its implementation.
Our level of disclosure and accountability on directors’ 
pay significantly exceeds the reporting and voting 
requirements for an AIM-listed company, in line with 
the Board’s commitment to high standards of corporate 
governance transparency.
Our remuneration policy is aligned with our strategy 
of generating shareholder returns, maintaining our core 
market position while exploiting new market opportunities, 
and operating a progressive dividend policy. Alignment 
with our strategy is achieved through incentive plans that 
are growth focused, targeting short and longer-term 
improvements in profitability, cash generation, and revenue 
growth. We also have a bias towards delivering variable pay 
earned in company shares, with part deferral of annual 
bonus into shares, and through our share-based long-term 
incentive plan. Our plans also include recovery and 
withholding provisions in the event of an overpayment, 
and we have minimum share ownership guidelines in 
place for the executives. This ensures that management 
and shareholders are aligned over the longer term.
Application of remuneration policy in 2017
The base salaries of the Executive Directors were not 
increased in 2017, and no changes were made to the annual 
bonus structure. As in prior years, bonuses were eligible 
to be earned based on performance against challenging 
Underlying EBITDA, Free Cash Flow and revenue growth 
targets. The choice of bonus metrics reflects the Company’s 
focus on delivering profitable growth, generating increased 
Free Cash Flow, delivering against the Transformation 
Programme, and operating a progressive dividend policy.
However, the Committee did refine the operation of 
the long-term incentive plan in 2017. The Committee 
reviewed the ongoing appropriateness of granting long-
term incentive awards against EPS and cumulative Free 
Cash Flow targets, and concluded that the awards in 2017 
would be granted 50% subject to the level of cumulative 
Free Cash Flow achieved over the period through to 
31 December 2019 and 50% based on Manx’s relative 
TSR performance versus the FTSE All Share constituents 
(excluding Investment Trusts) over the same period. The 
Committee considered that the use of growth in Free Cash 
Flow and delivering above median TSR directly aligns 
the executive team with the Board’s strategy of creating 
an above median rate of total return underpinned by 
profitable, cash generative, growth.
2017 performance related pay
Stretching performance conditions were set at the 
start of the year for the annual bonus plan, and the solid 
performance delivered resulted in an annual bonus payable 
to the Chief Executive Officer of 36.8% of salary out of the 
maximum opportunity of 100% of salary.
May 2018 will mark the third anniversary of the awards 
granted under the Company’s long-term incentive plan 
in 2015. Subject to remaining in employment, these awards 
are eligible to vest in May, based on the extent to which 
challenging Earning Per Share (EPS) and Cash Flow targets 
were met over the three years to 31 December 2017. With 
the Company achieving 2.81% compound annual growth in 
EPS over the period, and generating cumulative Free Cash 
Flow of £52.0m, the awards are expected to vest at 55.3%  
of the maximum, based on the performance achieved 
relative to the targets originally set.
The Committee believes that the overall remuneration 
delivered in relation to 2017 represents a fair outcome for 
the recipients and for the Company’s shareholders and wider 
stakeholders, given the financial performance of the Company, 
which has been delivered in challenging market conditions  
and during a period of significant change for the Group.
Application of remuneration policy in 2018
The Committee has reviewed the operation of the policy 
in advance of the current financial year. The base salaries 
of the Chief Executive Officer will be the subject of review 
with effect from 1 April 2018.
The annual bonus plan was subject to a review during the 
year and the Committee concluded that while the maximum 
bonus opportunity remained appropriate, revisions should 
be made to the performance metrics to better align the 
2018 scheme with the Company’s current strategic priorities. 
Accordingly, the 2018 annual bonus will include targets 
relating to improving our customers’ experiences and 
how effective we are at engaging our people in addition 
to delivering against our plans for underlying EBITDA,  
Free Cash Flow and Revenue. As in prior years, payment  
of any bonus will rely on threshold levels of financial 
performance being achieved.
Following a review of the metrics applying to long-term 
incentives in 2017 (as detailed above), the Committee 
concluded that the same general approach (granting 
awards subject to cumulative Free Cash Flow and relative 
TSR) will be retained for the awards to be granted in 2018. 
Further details are included in page 52.
I trust that shareholders will support the resolution 
to approve this report.

Part 1 – Remuneration policy for Executive Directors
The objective of the Company’s remuneration policy for Executive Directors is to ensure that it supports the long-term 
strategy of the business and provides a strong alignment of interest between executives and shareholders.
The total remuneration package is structured so that a significant proportion is linked to performance conditions measured 
over both the short term and longer term. A high proportion of the potential remuneration is paid in shares, thereby ensuring 
that executives have a strong ongoing alignment with shareholders through the Company’s share price performance.
When setting the levels of short-term and long-term variable remuneration and the balance of cash and share-based 
elements, consideration is given to obtaining the appropriate balance so as not to encourage unnecessary risk-taking, 
whilst ensuring that performance hurdles are suitably challenging.
The table below summarises the key aspects of the Company’s remuneration policy for directors:
Element Purpose and link to strategy Operation Maximum opportunity
Base salary To recruit and reward 
executives of a suitable 
calibre for the role and 
duties required.
Reviewed annually by the Committee, 
taking account of company performance, 
individual performance, changes in 
responsibility and levels of increase for 
the workforce generally.
Reference is also made to comparator 
benchmarks from time to time.
The Committee considers the impact 
of any basic salary increase on the total 
remuneration package.
In relation to the policy for salary 
increases, there is no prescribed 
maximum annual increase. The 
Committee is guided by movements 
in market rates, the performance of the 
business and the general salary increase 
for the broader employee population, 
but on occasions may need to recognise, 
for example, development in role, 
change in responsibility, and/or specific 
retention issues.
Benefits To provide 
market-competitive 
benefits and to ensure the 
well-being of employees.
The Company typically provides:
 – car allowance
 – medical insurance
 – death and disability insurance
 – other ancillary benefits, including 
relocation expenses (as required)
 
In addition, the Company operates 
a share save scheme.
Executive Directors are also entitled 
to 30 days’ leave per annum.
Car allowance is determined by seniority. 
The value of other benefits is based  
on the cost to the Company and is  
not predetermined.
Pension To provide 
market-competitive 
benefits and to assist 
post-retirement 
financial planning.
A company contribution to a money 
purchase pension scheme or provision 
of cash allowance in lieu of pension 
at the request of the individual.
Up to 10% of base salary.
Annual bonus To encourage and reward 
delivery of the Company’s 
operational objectives.
The annual bonus is based on 
performance against a range of the 
Company’s key performance indicators.
One third of any bonus earned will be 
paid in shares, which must be held for 
at least two years.
A recovery and withholding mechanism 
applies in the event of a material 
misstatement of the Group’s Financial 
Statements and also for other  
defined reasons.
100% of salary at stretch performance.

Element Purpose and link to strategy Operation Maximum opportunity
Long-term 
incentives 
(‘LTIP’)
To encourage and reward 
delivery of the Company’s 
long-term strategic 
objectives and provide 
alignment with 
shareholders through 
the use of share- 
based remuneration.
Annual awards of performance shares.
Awards are released subject to 
continued employment and satisfaction 
of challenging performance conditions 
measured over three years.
A recovery and withholding mechanism 
applies to all participants in the event 
of a material misstatement of the 
Group’s accounts and also for other 
defined reasons.
The maximum limit in the plan rules 
is 150% of salary (face value of shares 
at grant). The current policy within 
the plan limit is up to 100% of base 
salary. 25% of the award is payable  
for threshold performance.
Dividends that would be payable on  
the share awards are rolled up and paid 
out (in cash or shares) at the end of the 
vesting period based on the proportion 
of the award that actually vests.
Non-Executive 
Director fees
To attract and retain a 
high-calibre Chairman and 
Non-Executive Directors 
by offering a market- 
competitive fee level.
Fees are reviewed periodically.
Fee levels are set as appropriate for  
the role and responsibility for each NED 
position and with reference to market 
levels in comparably sized public 
companies. Fees are paid in cash.
The Chairman is paid a single fee for all 
his responsibilities. The Non-Executives 
are paid a basic fee. The Senior 
Independent Director and Chairmen 
of both the Audit and Remuneration 
Committees receive an additional fee 
to reflect extra responsibilities.
There is no prescribed maximum 
annual increase. Any increases to fee 
levels are guided by movements in 
market rates, the performance of the 
business and the general salary increase 
for the broader employee population, 
but on occasions may need to recognise, 
for example, change in responsibility, 
and/or time commitments.
Service contracts and payments for loss of office
The Remuneration Committee reviews the contractual terms for new Executive Directors to ensure that these reflect 
best practice.
Service contracts normally continue until the Director’s agreed retirement date or such other date as the parties agree. 
The service contracts contain a provision for early termination subject to six months’ notice from either the Company  
or the Executive Director.
A director’s service contract may be terminated without notice and without any further payment or compensation, except for 
sums accrued up to the date of termination, on the occurrence of certain events such as gross misconduct. If the employing 
company terminates the employment of an Executive Director in other circumstances, compensation is limited to salary due 
for any unexpired notice period and any amount assessed by the Remuneration Committee as representing the value of 
other contractual benefits (including pension) which would have been received during the period. Payments in lieu of notice 
are not pensionable. In the event of a change of control of the Company there is no enhancement to contractual terms.
Service contracts are available for inspection at the Company’s registered office.
Part 2 – Annual remuneration report
How the remuneration policy will be applied in 2018
2018 salary review
The salary level for Gary Lamb is currently £290,000. The next review date will be April 2018. In deciding whether to award 
any increase the Committee will consider movements in market rates, the performance of the business, the general salary 
increase for the broader employee population, and whether there is a need to recognise any change in responsibility and 
development in role. 52

Performance targets for the 2018 annual bonus
As noted in the Chairman’s statement, the annual bonus has been the subject of review. The conclusion was that the  
metrics we target for improvement in 2018 should be broadened to better reflect our current strategic priorities. As a result,  
the metrics and weightings we are to operate in relation to the 2018 annual bonus for Executive Directors are as follows:
Metric Weighting
Underlying EBITDA 20%
Underlying Cash Flow 20%
Revenue 20%
Customer Experience 20%
People Engagement 20%
In all cases a threshold level of financial performance (based on predetermined levels of EBITDA and cash flow) must 
be achieved before bonuses are eligible to become payable.
The 2018 targets are structured using sliding scales that have been set around our internal plans. The Customer and 
People targets are based on our Net Promoter scores (which include data collated externally). Improving customer 
satisfaction and employee engagement are core priorities in 2018 and, in tandem with our financial targets, support 
our overall objectives of delivering profitable growth and generating the cash flow to support our progressive dividend 
policy and investment objectives.
The specific targets for the 2018 annual bonus are not disclosed prospectively in this report as they are considered to be 
commercially sensitive. However, it is our intention that details of the target ranges, and achievement against them, will be 
set out in next year’s report.
Bonuses will be capped at 100% of base salary, with two thirds payable in cash. One third of a bonus earned must be 
invested in shares and held for two years.
LTIP awards to be granted in 2018
LTIP awards will be made over shares worth up to 100% of base salary. Consistent with the approach taken in 2017, the 2018 
long-term incentive awards will be granted subject to cumulative Free Cash Flow and relative TSR targets. The Committee 
remains comfortable that focusing on delivering growth in Free Cash Flow and above median TSR is directly aligned with 
the Company’s strategy.
The actual targets (tested over the three financial years ending 31 December 2020) are set out below:
For the 50% of the award subject to cumulative Free Cash Flow (FCF):
Cumulative CF for financial years 2018, 2019 and 2020 Percentage of the half of the award subject to the FCF condition that vests

2. Danny Bakhshi’s employment terminated in October 2017. In addition to the 2017 remuneration detailed above for Danny Bakhshi, he also received a payment 
totalling £38,000 which related to 2 months’ pay in lieu of notice. The payment included £35,000 in relation to 2 months’ base salary and £3,000 in relation to 
2 months’ pension and benefits. The payment, restricted to 2 months, was well within the contractual notice period of 6 months. Danny Bakhshi remained in 
employment during the period he received payment, and no further payments will be made in connection with his termination. His entitlement to a £100,000 
recruitment award; all outstanding long-term incentive awards and, entitlement to 2017 annual bonus lapsed on termination of employment. In relation to his 
2016 annual bonus, he is expected to hold the deferred shares for the full two-year period as required by the Company’s remuneration policy. No further payments 
will be made in connection with his departure.
3. This relates to the payment of the annual bonus for the year ending 31 December 2017 set out in the annual bonus pay outcome for 2017 on page 53. The annual 
bonus is subject to a mandatory deferral policy as set out in the policy table on page 50.
4. Further information regarding the vesting of the 2015 long-term incentive award is set out on page 54 below. Details of the 2016 long-term incentive vesting 
(under the CIP) was set out in last year’s Remuneration Report on page 44.
5. The 2016 remuneration of Sir Miles Walker relates to his role as an Independent Director up to 15 June 2016.
6. For Jeffrey Hume, included in the number were additional fees of £8,000 payable for chairing the Audit Committee and £5,000 payable for the role of Senior 
Independent Director.
7. The 2016 remuneration of Chris Hall relates to his role as an Independent Director from 15 June 2016. Chris was appointed as Chairman of the Remuneration 
Committee with effect from 1 June 2017 and included in the 2017, number are fees of £4,667 for his role as Chairman of the Committee. Kevin Walsh did not  
receive any additional fees beyond his fee for Chairing the Board while chairing the Remuneration Committee.

annual report and accounts 2017
Danny Bakhshi was not eligible for a bonus based on 2017 performance following his cessation of employment during the year.
The maximum annual bonus that the Chief Executive was eligible to earn was 100% of salary. The actual bonus payable, 
as detailed above, was 36.8% of salary. This compared to a formulaic bonus outcome of 40%. The difference is the result of 
the application of individual performance multiples across the Company, which may increase or reduce an individuals bonus 
entitlement. The application of these multiples cannot increase the total company bonus outturn. Although these multiples 
do not formally apply to Executive Directors, in order to hold total bonus spend constant there was a proportional scaling 
of all individual bonus awards. One third of the bonus earned must be invested in shares and held for two years.
The Committee has the discretion to adjust the final outcome upwards or downwards in the event that an exceptional event 
outside the Executive Directors’ control occurs which, in the Committee’s opinion, materially affects the bonus outcome. 
There were no such events during 2017.
Both cash and share elements of the bonus are subject to clawback.
2015 long-term incentive plan award
The LTIP awards granted on 11 May 2015 and 28 January 2016 are eligible to vest on 11 May 2018, subject to continued 
employment and satisfying the relevant performance conditions. The performance conditions relating to these awards were 
50% based on Underlying EPS performance and 50% based on cumulative Free Cash Flow (i.e. the sum of the Free Cash 
generated in 2015, 2016 and 2017).
The performance conditions, and the Company’s performance against them, are set out below. The value included in the

Directors’ shareholding and share interests to 31 December 2017
To align the interests of the Executive Directors with shareholders, participating executives are required to build up 
shareholdings through the retention of shares vesting under the Company’s share plans. The Executive Directors are 
required to build up a shareholding equivalent to at least 100% of salary, to be achieved through retaining at least 50% of 
their net of taxes gain arising from any shares vesting or acquired under the long-term incentive share plans, until such time 
as the share ownership target has been met. The Chairman and Non-Executive Directors are encouraged to hold shares in 
the Company but are not subject to a formal shareholding guideline. Details of the Directors’ interests in shares are shown 
in the table below:

statement of directors’ 
responsibilities in respect 
of the annual report and 
the financial statements
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report 
and the Group and Parent Company financial statements 
in accordance with applicable law and regulations.
As required by the AIM Rules of the London Stock Exchange 
they are required to prepare the Group financial statements 
in accordance with International Financial Reporting 
Standards as adopted by the EU (IFRSs as adopted by the 
EU) and applicable law. They have elected to prepare the 
Parent Company financial statements on the same basis.
The financial statements are required to give a true and fair 
view of the state of affairs of the Group and Parent Company 
and of the profit or loss of the Group for that period.
In preparing each of the Group and Parent Company 
financial statements, the Directors are required to:
 – select suitable accounting policies and then apply 
them consistently;
 – make judgements and estimates that are reasonable, 
relevant and reliable;
 – state whether they have been prepared in accordance 
with IFRSs as adopted by the EU;
 – assess the Group and Parent Company’s ability to 
continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, 
matters related to going concern; and
 – use the going concern basis of accounting unless 
they either intend to liquidate the Group or the Parent 
Company or to cease operations, or have no realistic 
alternative but to do so.
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate 
accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain 
the Parent Company’s transactions and disclose with 
reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position 
of the Parent Company. They are responsible for such 
internal control as they determine is necessary to enable 
the preparation of financial statements that are free from 
material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, 
and have general responsibility for taking such steps 
as are reasonably open to them to safeguard the 
assets of the Group and to prevent and detect fraud 
and other irregularities.
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and 
integrity of the corporate and financial information included 
on the Company’s website. Legislation governing the 
preparation and dissemination of financial statements 
may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.

auditor’s report
1. Our opinion is unmodified
We have audited the financial statements of Manx Telecom 
plc (“the Company”) for the year ended 31 December 2017 
which comprise the Consolidated Statement of 
Comprehensive Income, the Consolidated and Parent 
Company Statements of Financial Position, the 
Consolidated and Parent Company Statements of Changes 
in Equity and the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows, 
and the related notes, including the accounting policies in 
note 1.
In our opinion the financial statements:
 – give a true and fair view of the state of the Group’s 
and of the Parent Company’s affairs as at 31 December 
2017 and of the Group’s profit for the year then ended;
 – have been properly prepared in accordance with 
International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted 
by the European Union (IFRSs as adopted by the EU), 
as applicable to an Isle of Man Company; and
 – the financial statements have been prepared in 
accordance with the requirements of the Isle of Man 
Companies Act 2006.
Basis for opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International 
Standards on Auditing (UK) (“ISAs (UK)”) and applicable law. 
Our responsibilities are described below. We have fulfilled 
our ethical responsibilities under, and are independent of 
the Group in accordance with, UK ethical requirements 
including the FRC Ethical Standard. We believe that the 
audit evidence we have obtained is a sufficient and 
appropriate basis for our opinion.

2. Key audit matters: our assessment of risks of material misstatement
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in the audit of the financial 
statements and include the most significant assessed risks of material misstatement (whether or not due to fraud) identified 
by us, including those which had the greatest effect on: the overall audit strategy; the allocation of resources in the audit; 
and directing the efforts of the engagement team. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial 
statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. In 
arriving at our audit opinion above, the key audit matters, in decreasing order of audit significance, were as follows 
(unchanged from 2016):
The risk Our response
Revenue – All captions
(£78 million; 2016: £81m)
Refer to page 45 (Audit Committee Report), 
page 73 (accounting policy) and page 79 
(financial disclosures).
Processing error:
Manx Telecom has multiple systems which 
are used to collect usage data and record 
revenue. There is thus an inherent risk over 
the accuracy of revenue recorded.
Effect of irregularities:
There is a risk that management could 
manipulate financial records in order to 
overstate revenue due to the following 
factors:
 – Incentives & Pressures to meet analyst 
expectations to grow revenue, EBITDA 
and dividends;
 – Directors participate in Share Based 
Payments programs and are thus 
incentivised to increase share price
Our procedures included:
 – Control design and operation: We 
tested General IT Controls over Billing 
Systems and General Ledger and the 
operating effectiveness over 
reconciliation controls between billing 
systems and general ledger;
 – Outsourcing controls: We assessed the 
control environment and controls within 
the service organisation based on reports 
from other auditors;
 – Data comparisons: We re-performed 
the reconciliations between billing 
systems and the general ledger and 
followed up on any reconciling 
differences;
 – Expectation vs outcome: We performed 
substantive trend analysis over revenue 
streams. Where unusual movements were 
identified, we corroborated these 
through inspection of supporting 
documentation and inquiry; and
 – Tests of details: We assessed 
recoverability of trade debtors through 
an inspection of ageing and subsequent 
receipts testing.
We selected a sample of revenue 
transactions and agreed these to source 
documentation.
We selected a sample of accrued income 
and agreed these to post year-end billing.
Property, plant and equipment 
(‘PPE’)
(£59 million; 2016: £60m)
Refer to page 45 (Audit Committee Report), 
page 69 (accounting policy) and page 82 
(financial disclosures).
The Group operates in a competitive 
environment which is subject to rapid 
technological advances, creating an 
increased risk of obsolescence of PPE.
Subjective valuation:
The following management judgment 
impacts the carrying amount of property, 
plant and equipment and intangible assets:
 – Identification of impairment indicators; 
and
 – Selection of model and assumptions 
used to determine recoverable amount 
of relevant assets with an impairment 
indicator or fair value for assets held at 
fair value.
Our procedures included:
 – Benchmark model and assumptions: 
We assessed the model and assumptions 
used in the valuation. The model was 
assessed against generally accepted 
valuation models. Market assumptions 
were agreed to external independent 
information and subjective assumptions 
were assessed for basis; and
 – Historical comparison: We evaluated 
the track-record of future assumptions to 
actual performance.

The risk Our response
Property, plant and equipment 
(‘PPE’) continued
(£59 million; 2016: £60m)
Refer to page 45 (Audit Committee Report), 
page 69 (accounting policy) and page 82 
(financial disclosures).
Subjective estimate:
The following management judgements 
impact the carrying value of PPE:
 – The decision to capitalise or expense costs;
 – The timeliness of the transfer from assets in 
the course of construction; and
 – Expected completion date and benefits 
from the Transformation Programme.
Our procedures included:
 – Tests of detail: We selected a sample of 
project additions and agreed these to 
business case/budget for management 
authority, invoice and employee 
timesheet, as appropriate, to test that 
costs are capital in nature. We assessed 
expenditure to-date to confirm that the 
project was within budget. Where over 
budget, we challenged management to 
consider whether the asset is impaired. 
We also challenged management as to 
why open projects had not yet been 
brought into use and depreciated; and
 – Tests of detail: We selected a sample of 
assets transferred from AICC to PPE and 
inspected authority for capitalisation 
from the project manager. We then 
confirmed that the transfer to PPE and 
commencement of depreciation 
occurred during the next month after 
project manager authorisation.
 – Assessing transparency: Assessing the 
adequacy of the Group’s disclosures in 
respect of PPE.
Gross Pension liability
(£95.9 million; 2016: £96.3m)
Refer to page 45 (Audit Committee Report), 
page 71 (accounting policy) and page 87 
(financial disclosures).
General Note: Net liability recorded on 
balance sheet taking into account pension 
assets is £3.8 million; (2016: £5.4m)
Subjective valuation:
The valuation of the defined benefit liability 
is complex and involves actuarial valuation 
models and assumptions in respect of future 
events. There is a risk that the correct 
valuation methodology may not be followed 
or that assumptions may not be correct.
Our procedures included:
 – Assessing valuer’s credentials: We 
evaluated the competence and 
independence of the external actuary 
engaged by the Group;
 – Methodology choice: We used our own 
actuarial specialist to assess that the 
model and methodology used in the 
valuation is consistent with that specified 
by IFRS as adopted by the EU; and
 – Benchmarking assumptions: We used 
our own actuarial specialist to benchmark 
the assumptions used against market 
data.
 – Assessing transparency: Assessing the 
adequacy of the Group’s disclosures in 
respect of the Gross pension liability.
Parent Company’s balances due 
from related parties (subsidiaries)
(£95.8 million;2016: £94.6m)
Refer to page 45 (Audit Committee Report), 
page 68 (accounting policy) and page 98 
(financial disclosures).
Low risk, high value
The carrying amount of the debtor balances 
due from related parties represents 97% 
(2016: 98%) of the Parent Company’s total 
assets. Their recoverability is considered to 
be at a lower risk of significant misstatement 
or subject to significant judgement. 
However, due to their materiality in the 
context of the Parent Company financial 
statements, this is considered to be the area 
that had the greatest effect on our overall 
Parent Company audit.
Our procedures included :
 – Tests of detail: Assessing 100% of debtor 
balances due from related parties to 
identify, with reference to the relevant 
debtors’ balance sheet, whether they have 
a positive net asset value and therefore 
coverage of the debt owed, as well as 
assessing whether those debtor 
companies have historically been 
profit-making. 60

3. Our application of materiality and an overview 
of the scope of our audit
Group Materiality
Materiality for the Group financial statements as a whole 
was set at £0.6m (2016: £0.6m), determined with reference to 
a benchmark of Total Revenue, of which it represents 0.8% 
(2016: 0.7%).
We consider Total Revenue to be the most appropriate 
benchmark as it provides a more stable measure year on 
year than Group profit before tax.
Parent Company Materiality
Materiality for the Parent Company financial statements was 
set at £0.6m (2016: £0.6m), determined with reference to a 
benchmark of Total assets, of which it represents 0.61% 
(2016: 0.62%).
We design our procedures for both the Group and Parent 
Company financial statements to detect errors at a lower 
level of precision, set at £0.42m (2016: £0.42m).
We agreed to report to the Board of Directors any corrected 
or uncorrected identified misstatements exceeding £0.03m 
(2016: £0.03m) in addition to other identified misstatements 
that warranted reporting on qualitative grounds.
Scope
The work on the Group and its subsidiaries, including the audit 
of the Parent Company, was performed by the Group team.

4. We have nothing to report on going concern
We are required to report to you if we have concluded that 
the use of the going concern basis of accounting is 
inappropriate or there is an undisclosed material uncertainty 
that may cast significant doubt over the use of that basis for 
a period of at least twelve months from the date of approval 
of the financial statements. We have nothing to report in 
these respects.
5. We have nothing to report on the other information 
in the Annual Report
The Directors are responsible for the other information 
presented in the Annual Report together with the financial 
statements. Our opinion on the financial statements does 
not cover the other information and, accordingly, we do not 
express an audit opinion or, except as explicitly stated 
below, any form of assurance conclusion thereon.
Our responsibility is to read the other information and,  
in doing so, consider whether, based on our financial 
statements audit work, the information therein is materially 
misstated or inconsistent with the financial statements or 
our audit knowledge. Based solely on that work we have not 
identified material misstatements in the other information.
Directors’ report
Based solely on our work on the other information:
 – we have not identified material misstatements  
in the strategic report and the directors’ report;
 – in our opinion the information given in those reports for  
the financial year is consistent with the financial statements;
6. Respective responsibilities
Directors’ responsibilities
As explained more fully in their statement set out on page 56, 
the Directors are responsible for: the preparation of the 
financial statements including being satisfied that they give a 
true and fair view; such internal control as they determine is 
necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements 
that are free from material misstatement, whether due to 
fraud or error; assessing the Group and Parent Company’s 
ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as 
applicable, matters related to going concern; and using the 
going concern basis of accounting unless they either intend 
to liquidate the Group or the Parent Company or to cease 
operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.
Auditor’s responsibilities
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about 
whether the financial statements as a whole are free from 
material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and  
to issue our opinion in an auditor’s report. Reasonable 
assurance is a high level of assurance, but does not 
guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs 
(UK) will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. 
Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are 
considered material if, individually or in aggregate, they could 
reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions 
of users taken on the basis of the financial statements.
A fuller description of our responsibilities is provided on the 
FRC’s website at www.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities.
7. The purpose of our audit work and to whom we owe 
our responsibilities
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a 
body, in accordance with Section 80(c) of the Isle of Man 
Companies Act 2006. Our audit work has been undertaken 
so that we might state to the Company’s members those 
matters we are required to state to them in an auditor’s 
report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent 
permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility 
to anyone other than the Company and the Company’s 
members, as a body, for our audit work, for this report,  
or for the opinions we have formed.

for the year ended 31 december 2017
1 Accounting policies
Manx Telecom plc (‘the Company’) is a company incorporated and domiciled in the Isle of Man in accordance with the Isle of 
Man Companies Act 2006.
The Group financial statements consolidate those of the Company and its subsidiaries (together referred to as ‘the Group’). 
The Parent Company financial statements present information about the Company as a separate entity.
The principal accounting policies adopted are set out below.
Basis of preparation
The consolidated and company financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial 
Reporting Standards (‘IFRS’) as adopted by the European Union. Where necessary, comparative figures have been adjusted 
to conform to changes in presentation for the current year.
Going concern
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the going concern basis. The Group is profit making, 
generates cash inflows from operating activities, and is in a net asset and net current asset position. The Group has 
considerable financial resources, minimal liquidity risk and is operating within a sector that is experiencing relatively stable 
demand for its products.
The Group utilises secured lending facilities which require compliance with certain financial covenants. The Group has  
not breached any such financial covenants during the year or post year end, and had significant headroom within its 
requirements at year end as detailed in note 13. Under the terms of the secured bank facility, the Group also has the ability  
to draw a further £10m of funding, though currently it has no intention of drawing on this facility.
Alongside the factors noted above, the Directors have considered the Group’s forecasts and budgets, including cash flow 
forecasts, together with a reasonably possible risk sensitivity analysis. The Directors are satisfied that the forecasts, alongside 
the Group’s current and undrawn lending facilities, show that the Group will continue to be able to meet cash funding 
requirements as they fall due and operate for the foreseeable future.
Accordingly, after making enquiries, the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Company and the Group have 
adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future. Thus, they continue to adopt the going 
concern basis of accounting in preparing the annual financial statements.
1 . 1  M easure me nt con v e nt ion
The financial statements are prepared on the historical cost basis except for the revaluation of certain properties and 
financial instruments that are measured at revalued amounts or fair values at the end of each reporting period, as explained 
in the accounting policies below.
1.2 Basis of consolidation
Subsidiaries
The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the Company and entities controlled by the 
Company (its subsidiaries) made up to 31 December each year. Control is achieved when the Company has the power over 
the investee, is exposed to, or has rights, to variable return from its involvement with the investee and has the ability to use 
its power to affect its returns. In assessing control, the Group takes into consideration potential voting rights that are 
currently exercisable. The acquisition date is the date on which control is transferred to the acquirer. The financial statements 
of subsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date that control commences until the date 
that control ceases. Losses applicable to the non-controlling interests in a subsidiary are allocated to the non-controlling 
interests even if doing so causes the non-controlling interests to have a deficit balance. The investments in subsidiaries are 
held at cost.
1.3 Foreign currency
The individual financial statements of each group company are presented in the currency of the primary economic 
environment in which it operates (its functional currency). For the purposes of the consolidated financial statements,  
the results and financial position of each group company are expressed in pounds sterling, which is the functional currency  
of the Company and the presentational currency for the consolidated financial statements. 68

annual report and accounts 2017
notes continued
1 Accounting policies continued
1.3 Foreign currency continued
Transactions in foreign currencies are translated to the respective functional currencies of group entities at the foreign 
exchange rate ruling at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at  
the balance sheet date are retranslated to the functional currency at the foreign exchange rate ruling at that date. Foreign 
exchange differences arising on translation are recognised in the income statement. Non-monetary assets and liabilities  
that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are not retranslated. Non-monetary assets and liabilities 
denominated in foreign currencies that are stated at fair value are retranslated to the functional currency at the foreign 
exchange rates ruling at the dates the fair value was determined.
1.4 Non-derivative financial instruments
Non-derivative financial instruments comprise investments in equity and debt securities, trade and other receivables, cash and 
cash equivalents, amounts due to/from the Group and related companies, loans and borrowings, and trade and other payables.
Debt and equity instruments are classified as either financial liabilities or equity in accordance with the substance of the 
contractual arrangement.
The Group initially recognises financial assets such as loans and receivables and deposits on the date that they are 
originated. All other financial assets (including assets designated at fair value through profit or loss) are recognised initially 
on the trade date at which the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.
The Group derecognises a financial asset when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the asset expire, or it transfers 
the rights to receive the contractual cash flows on the financial asset in a transaction in which substantially all the risks and 
rewards of ownership of the financial asset are transferred. Any interest in transferred financial assets that is created or 
retained by the Group is recognised as a separate asset.
The Group initially recognises financial liabilities such as payables and liabilities designated at fair value through profit or loss 
on the trade date at which the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.
The Group derecognises a financial liability when, and only when, the Group’s obligations are discharged, cancelled or expire. 
Any interest in transferred financial liabilities that is created or retained by the Group is recognised as a separate liability.
Transaction costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition or issue of financial assets and financial liabilities (other than 
financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss) are added to or deducted from the fair value of the 
financial assets or financial liabilities, as appropriate, on initial recognition. Transaction costs directly attributable to the 
acquisition of financial assets or financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss are recognised immediately in profit or loss.
Fair value
Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between 
market participants at the measurement date, regardless of whether that price is directly observable or estimated using 
another valuation technique. In estimating the fair value of an asset or liability, the Group takes into account the 
characteristics of the asset or liability at the measurement date. Fair value for measurement and/or disclosure purposes in 
these consolidated financial statements is determined on such a basis, except for share-based payments within the scope of 
IFRS 2, leasing transactions that are within the scope of IAS 17, and measurements that have some similarities to fair value but 
are not fair value, such as net realisable value in IAS 2 or value in use in IAS 36.
In addition, for financial reporting purposes, fair value measurements are categorised into Level 1, 2 or 3 based on the 
degree to which the inputs to the fair value measurements are observable and the significance of the inputs to the fair value 
measurements are observable and the significance of the inputs to the fair value measurement in its entirety, which are 
described as follows:
 – Level 1: quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities;
 – Level 2: inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly 
or indirectly; and
 – Level 3: inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data.
Trade and other receivables
Trade and other receivables are recognised initially at fair value. Subsequent to initial recognition, they are measured at 
amortised cost using the effective interest method, less any impairment losses. 69

1 Accounting policies continued
1.4 Non-derivative financial instruments continued
Trade and other payables
Trade and other payables are recognised initially at fair value. Subsequent to initial recognition, they are measured at 
amortised cost using the effective interest method.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise deposits with banks and highly liquid financial assets subject to an insignificant risk  
of changes in their fair value and which are used by the Group in the management of short-term commitments.
Interest-bearing borrowings
Interest-bearing borrowings are recognised initially at fair value less attributable transaction costs. Subsequent to initial 
recognition, interest-bearing borrowings are stated at amortised cost using the effective interest method. Changes in 
expected cash flows due to changes in applicable interest rates will be accounted for through an adjustment of the carrying 
amount of the liability using the original effective interest rate.
When the Group exchanges with the existing lender one debt instrument into another one with substantially different terms, 
such exchange is accounted for as an extinguishment of the original financial liability and the recognition of a new financial 
liability. Similarly, the Group accounts for substantial modification of terms of an existing liability or part of it as an 
extinguishment of the original financial liability and the recognition of a new liability. It is assumed that the terms are 
substantially different if the discounted present value of the cash flows under the new terms, including any fees paid net of 
any fees received and discounted using the original effective rate is at least 10% different from the discounted present value 
of the remaining cash flows of the original financial liability.
Equity instruments
An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of an entity after deducting all of its 
liabilities. Equity instruments issued by the Group are recognised at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
Repurchase of the Company’s own equity instruments is recognised and deducted directly in equity. No gain or loss is 
recognised in profit or loss on the purchase, sale, issue or cancellation of the Company’s own equity instruments.
Own shares
Own shares represent shares in the Company held by the Group employee benefit trust and are recorded at cost deducted 
from equity. When shares vest unconditionally or are cancelled, they are transferred from the own shares reserve to retained 
earnings at their weighted average cost. Other assets and liabilities of the employee benefit trust are consolidated within the 
assets of the Group.
1.5 Derivative financial instruments
The Group enters into derivative financial instruments to manage its exposure to interest rate risk. Further details of derivative 
financial instruments are disclosed in note 18(d). Derivative financial instruments are recognised at fair value and classified as held 
for trading. Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value at the date a derivative contract is entered into, and are subsequently 
remeasured to their fair value at each balance sheet date. The resulting gain or loss is recognised in profit or loss immediately. 
A derivative with a positive fair value is recognised as a financial asset whereas a derivative with a negative fair value is recognised 
as a financial liability. A derivative is presented as a non-current asset, or a non-current liability if the remaining maturity of the 
instrument is more than 12 months and it is not expected to be realised or settled within 12 months. Other derivatives are 
presented as current assets or current liabilities. Any interest expense arising on derivative financial instruments is recognised 
separately from the fair value movement and is included in finance costs in the statement of comprehensive income.
1.6 Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment is stated at historical cost less depreciation and accumulated impairment losses except for 
land and buildings which have been revalued to fair value. Revaluations are performed with sufficient regularity such that the 
carrying amount does not differ materially from that which would be determined using fair values at the balance sheet date.
Any gain arising on the remeasurement of land and buildings is recognised in profit or loss to the extent that it reverses a previous 
impairment loss on the specific property, with any remaining gain recognised in other comprehensive income and presented in 
the revaluation reserve. The cost of property, plant and equipment includes directly attributable incremental costs incurred in their 
acquisition and installation. Depreciation on revalued land and buildings is charged to the statement of comprehensive income.
Subsequent costs are included in the asset’s carrying amount or recognised as a separate asset, as appropriate, only when  
it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to the Group and the cost of the item can be 
measured reliably. 70

annual report and accounts 2017
notes continued
1 Accounting policies continued
1.6 Property, plant and equipment continued
Property, plant and equipment in the course of construction are carried at cost, less any recognised impairment loss. 
Depreciation of these assets commences when the assets are ready for their intended use.
Depreciation is provided on property, plant and equipment from the date they are brought into use, in equal instalments 
over their estimated useful lives. The lives assigned to property, plant and equipment are:
 – Facilities (including property) 40 years
 – Network assets 5 to 20 years
 – Plant and machinery 4 to 10 years
 – Computers, software and office equipment 3 to 10 years
 – Motor vehicles 7 years
The estimated useful economic lives, residual value and depreciation method are reviewed at the end of each reporting 
period, with the effect of any changes in estimate accounted for on a prospective basis.
No depreciation is provided on freehold land or assets in course of construction. Assets in the course of construction are 
carried at cost, less any recognised impairment loss. Depreciation of assets in the course of construction commences when 
the assets are ready for their intended use.
Where there is evidence of impairment, fixed assets are written down to recoverable amounts. Any such write-down is 
charged to operating profit as an impairment loss and separately disclosed if material.
Assets held under finance leases are depreciated over the shorter of their expected useful economic lives on the same basis 
as owned assets or, where shorter, over the term of the relevant lease.
An item of property, plant and equipment is derecognised upon disposal or when no future economic benefits are expected 
to arise from the continued use of the asset. The gain or loss arising on the disposal or scrappage of an asset is determined 
as the difference between the sales proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset and is recognised within the statement of 
comprehensive income. When revalued assets are sold, the amounts included within the revaluation reserve are transferred 
to retained earnings.
1.7 Intangible assets and goodwill
Goodwill
Goodwill is stated at cost less any accumulated impairment losses. Goodwill is allocated to cash-generating units and is  
not amortised but is tested annually for impairment by completing a goodwill assessment at the reporting date, or more 
frequently, when there is an indication that the unit may be impaired. An impairment loss recognised for goodwill is not 
reversed in a subsequent period. In respect of equity-accounted investees, the carrying amount of goodwill is included  
in the carrying amount of the investment in the investee.
Other intangible assets
Software
Non-current assets which incorporate both tangible and intangible elements are assessed to determine whether they should 
be classed as an intangible asset or as property, plant and equipment. The treatment is determined by an assessment of 
which element is more significant.
Acquired software is capitalised on the basis of the costs incurred to acquire and bring into use the specific software.  
These costs are amortised over their estimated useful lives of three to five years. Amortisation is charged to cost of sales  
in the statement of comprehensive income on a straight-line basis.
Domain names
Domain names are not amortised but are assessed for impairment on an annual basis.
An intangible asset is derecognised on disposal, or when no future economic benefits are expected from use or disposal. 
Gains or losses arising from derecognition of an intangible asset, measured as the difference between the net disposal 
proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset, are recognised in profit or loss when the asset is derecognised. 71
manx telecom plc 
annual report and accounts 2017
overview strategic report governance report financial statements other
1 Accounting policies continued
1.8 Inventories
Inventories mainly comprise items of equipment held for sale or rental and consumable items. They are stated at the  
lower of cost, including appropriate overheads, and estimated net realisable value. Where necessary, provisions are made  
for obsolete, slow-moving and defective inventories. Inventories are shown net of any provisions made. Cost is calculated 
using the first-in-first-out method.
1.9 Impairment excluding inventories
Financial assets
A financial asset not carried at fair value through profit or loss is assessed at each reporting date to determine whether  
there is objective evidence that it is impaired. A financial asset is impaired if objective evidence indicates that a loss event 
has occurred after the initial recognition of the asset, and that the loss event had a negative effect on the estimated future 
cash flows of that asset that can be estimated reliably.
An impairment loss in respect of a financial asset measured at amortised cost is calculated as the difference between its 
carrying amount and the present value of the estimated future cash flows discounted at the asset’s original effective interest 
rate. Interest on the impaired asset continues to be recognised through the unwinding of the discount. When a subsequent 
event causes the amount of impairment loss to decrease, the decrease in impairment loss is reversed through profit or loss.
The carrying amount of the financial asset is reduced by the impairment loss directly for all financial assets with the  
exception of trade receivables, where the carrying amount is reduced through the use of an allowance account. When  
a trade receivable is considered uncollectible, it is written off against the allowance account. Subsequent recoveries of 
amounts previously written off are credited against the allowance account. Changes in the carrying amount of the allowance 
account are recognised in profit or loss.
Non-financial assets
The carrying amounts of the Group’s non-financial assets, other than inventories, are reviewed at each reporting date to 
determine whether there is any indication of impairment. If any such indication exists, then the asset’s recoverable amount  
is estimated. For goodwill, and for intangible assets that have indefinite useful lives or that are not yet available for use,  
the recoverable amount is estimated each year at the same time.
The recoverable amount of an asset or cash-generating unit is the greater of its value in use and its fair value less costs to 
sell. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount 
rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset. For the purpose 
of impairment testing, assets that cannot be tested individually are grouped together into the smallest group of assets that 
generates cash inflows from continuing use that are largely independent of the cash inflows of other assets or groups of 
assets (the ‘cash-generating units’, ‘CGUs’). The goodwill acquired in a business combination, for the purpose of impairment 
testing, is allocated to CGUs where appropriate.
An impairment loss is recognised if the carrying amount of an asset or its CGU exceeds its estimated recoverable amount. 
Impairment losses are recognised in profit or loss. Impairment losses recognised in respect of CGUs are allocated first to 
reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the units, and then to reduce the carrying amounts of the other 
assets in the unit (group of units) on a pro rata basis.
An impairment loss in respect of goodwill is not reversed. In respect of other assets, impairment losses recognised  
in prior periods are assessed at each reporting date for any indications that the loss has decreased or no longer exists.  
An impairment loss is reversed if there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the recoverable amount.  
An impairment loss is reversed only to the extent that the asset’s carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount  
that would have been determined, net of depreciation or amortisation, if no impairment loss had been recognised.
1.10 Employee benefits
Employee benefits – pension obligations
The Group operates two pension arrangements. The Manx Telecom Trading Limited Combined Pension Scheme is a defined 
benefit scheme and the Manx Telecom Employee Retirement Plan is a defined contribution plan.
A defined contribution plan is a post-employment benefit plan under which the Group pays fixed contributions into  
a separate entity and will have no legal or constructive obligation to pay further amounts. Obligations for contributions  
to defined contribution pension plans are recognised as an expense in the income statement in the periods during which 
services are rendered by employees. 72
manx telecom plc 
annual report and accounts 2017
notes continued
1 Accounting policies continued
1.10 Employee benefits continued
For the defined contribution plan, the Group pays fixed contributions to a privately administered pension plan on behalf  
of employees. The Group has no further payment obligations once the contributions have been paid. The contributions  
are recognised as an employee benefit expense when they are due. Prepaid contributions are recognised as an asset  
to the extent that a cash refund or a reduction in the future payments is available.
A defined benefit scheme is a pension scheme that sets the amount of pension benefit that an employee will receive on 
retirement, usually dependent on one or more factors such as age, years of service and compensation.
The defined benefit obligation is calculated annually by independent actuaries using the projected unit credit method.  
The present value of the defined benefit obligation is determined by discounting the estimated future cash outflows using 
interest rates of high-quality corporate bonds that are denominated in the currency in which the benefits will be paid, and 
that have terms to maturity approximating to the terms of the related pension liability.
Remeasurements of the net defined benefit asset/liability comprising actuarial gains and losses, the effect of the asset 
ceiling (if applicable) and the return on scheme assets (excluding interest) are recognised immediately in the balance sheet 
with a charge or credit to the statement of comprehensive income in the period in which they occur. Remeasurement 
recorded in the statement of comprehensive income is not recycled.
Past service cost is recognised in profit or loss in the period of a plan amendment. Net interest is calculated by applying the 
discount rate at the beginning of the period to the net defined benefit liability or asset. Defined benefit costs are 
categorised as follows:
 – Service cost (including current service cost, past service cost, as well as gains and losses on curtailments and settlements).
 – Net interest expense or income.
 – Remeasurement.
The Group presents the first two components of defined benefit costs in profit or loss in the line item ‘Administrative 
expenses’. Curtailment gains and losses are accounted for as past service costs. Net interest expense or income is 
recognised within finance costs (see note 5).
The asset or liability recognised in the statement of financial position in respect of the defined benefit pension plan is the 
present value of the defined benefit obligation at the period end date less the fair value of plan assets. Any surplus resulting 
from this calculation is limited to the present value of any economic benefits available in the form of refunds from the scheme 
or reductions in future contributions to the scheme.
The assets of the schemes are held independently of the Group’s finances.
Short-term benefits
Short-term employee benefit obligations are measured on an undiscounted basis and are expensed as the related service  
is provided. A liability is recognised for the amount expected to be paid under short-term cash bonus or profit-sharing plans 
if the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation to pay this amount as a result of past service provided by the 
employee and the obligation can be estimated reliably.
Share-based payments
Equity-settled share-based payments to employees and others providing similar services are measured at the fair value of 
the equity instruments at the grant date. The fair value excludes the effect of non-market-based vesting conditions. The 
grant date fair value of share-based payment awards granted to employees is recognised as an employee expense, with a 
corresponding increase in equity. The fair value determined at the grant date of the equity-settled share-based payments is 
expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on the Group’s estimate of the equity instruments that will 
eventually vest. Fair value is measured using either a Black-Scholes or Monte Carlo method, whichever is most appropriate  
to the share-based payment arrangement.
At each balance sheet date, the Group revises its estimate of the number of equity instruments expected to vest as a result 
of the effect of non-market-based vesting conditions. The impact of the revision of the original estimates, if any, is 
recognised in profit or loss such that the cumulative expense reflects the revised estimate, with a corresponding adjustment 
to equity reserves.
For share-based payment awards with non-vesting conditions, the grant date fair value of the share-based payment is 
measured to reflect such conditions, and there is no true-up for differences between expected and actual outcomes. 73

1 Accounting policies continued
1.10 Employee benefits continued
Awards that lapse – or are forfeited – result in a credit to the income statement (reversing all previously recognised charges) 
in the year in which they lapse or are forfeited. SAYE share options granted to employees are treated as cancelled when 
employees cease to contribute to the scheme. This results in accelerated recognition of the expenses that would have  
arisen over the remainder of the original vesting period.
For cash-settled share-based payments, a liability is recognised for the goods or services acquired, measured initially at  
the fair value of the liability. At each balance sheet date until the liability is settled, and at the date of settlement, the fair 
value of the liability is remeasured, with any changes in fair value recognised in profit or loss for the year.
1.11 Provisions
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of past events, it is probable 
that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate of the amount can be made.
A restructuring provision is recognised when the Group has developed a detailed formal plan for the restructuring and  
has raised a valid expectation in those affected that it will carry out the restructuring by starting to implement the plan  
or by announcing its main features to those affected by it. The measurement of a restructuring provision includes only  
the direct expenditures arising from the restructuring, which are those amounts which are both necessarily entailed by  
the restructuring and not associated with the ongoing activities of the entity.
1.12 Revenue
Revenue comprises the value of services provided, equipment sales and other revenue. Revenue is measured at the fair  
value of the consideration received or receivable and represents amounts receivable for goods and services provided in the 
normal course of business, net of discounts, VAT and other sales-related taxes. Revenue is reduced for estimated customer 
returns, rebates and other similar allowances.
Revenue is recognised on a gross basis where the Group’s role is that of principal in a transaction. The gross basis  
represents the gross value of the billing to the customer after trade discounts, with any related costs being charged to 
operating expenses. Where the Group acts as agent in a transaction, the net revenue earned is recognised as revenue.
Revenue from telecommunications services provided to customers, which include Mobile, Fixed Line, Broadband and  
Data Services, as well as Global Solutions services, is recognised once the service is provided over the Group’s network, 
regardless of whether the customer pays in advance or is billed in arrears. Prepayments made by customers are recorded  
in deferred income and recognised in revenue as and when usage occurs.
Inbound roaming revenue, earned from other mobile operators whose customers roam onto the Group’s network, and 
outbound roaming revenue, earned from customers roaming outside their domestic coverage area, is recognised upon usage.
Subscription fees are recognised evenly throughout the periods to which they relate. Hardware revenue principally  
consists of revenue from the sale of wireless mobile devices. The revenue associated with the sale of wireless handsets  
and accessories is recognised when the products are delivered and accepted by the customer. The amount of revenue 
recognised is the value of the cash received from the sale.
In revenue arrangements including more than one deliverable, the arrangements are divided into separate units  
of accounting. Deliverables are considered separate units of accounting if the following two conditions are met:  
(1) the deliverable has value to the customer on a standalone basis; and (2) there is evidence of the fair value of the  
item. The arrangement consideration is allocated to each separate unit of accounting based on its relative fair value.
Revenue from Data Centre services, which include co-location, managed hosting, cloud and disaster recovery services, is 
recognised on a straight-line basis over the term of the contract. Power usage is recognised as the power is used by the customer. 
When services are required before related co-location services can be provided, these are recognised as they are provided.
Other revenue comprises managed services, equipment sales and revenue from the provision of mobile telecommunications 
software. All revenue is recognised when the goods and services have been provided and accepted by the customer.  
The value recognised for equipment sales is the value of the cash received from the sale. Managed service revenues  
are recognised in the period to which the services relate.

1.13 Expenses continued
Operating lease payments
Leases where a significant portion of the risks and rewards of ownership are retained by the lessor are classified as operating 
leases. Rentals under operating leases are charged to the statement of comprehensive income on a straight-line basis over 
the term of the lease. In the event that lease incentives are received to enter into operating leases, such incentives are 
recognised as a liability. The aggregate benefit of incentives is recognised as a reduction of rental expense on a straight-line 
basis over the lease term, except where another systematic basis is more representative of the time pattern in which 
economic benefits from the leased asset are consumed.
Finance lease payments
Leases are classified as finance leases whenever the terms of the lease transfer substantially all the risk and rewards of 
ownership to the lessee. Assets held under finance leases are recognised as assets of the Group at their fair value or, if lower, at 
the present value of the minimum lease payments, each determined at the inception of the lease. Minimum lease payments are 
apportioned between the finance charge and the reduction of the outstanding liability. The finance charge is allocated to each 
period during the lease term so as to produce a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability.
Financing income and expenses
Financing expenses comprise interest payable, loan repayment fee costs, finance charges on shares classified as liabilities, 
finance leases recognised in profit or loss using the effective interest method, unwinding of the discount on provisions, and 
net foreign exchange losses that are recognised in the income statement (see note 1.3).
Borrowing costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of an asset that takes a 
substantial time to be prepared for use are capitalised as part of the cost of that asset. All other borrowing costs are 
recognised in profit or loss in the period in which they are incurred.
Loan arrangement fees are capitalised and amortised over the loan term.
Finance income comprises interest receivable on funds invested, dividend income and net foreign exchange gains. Interest 
income and interest payable is recognised in profit or loss as it accrues, using the effective interest method.
Dividend income is recognised in the income statement on the date the entity’s right to receive payments is established. 
Foreign currency gains and losses are reported on a net basis.

1.14 New currently effective requirements and forthcoming requirements continued
The Directors do not expect that the adoption of the Standards and Interpretations listed above will have a material impact 
on the financial statements of the Group in future periods, with the exception of IFRS 15 and IFRS 16, of which the impacts 
have been outlined below.
1.14.1 Estimated impact of the adoption of IFRS 15 and IFRS 16
The Group is required to adopt IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with customers from 1 January 2018 and has elected to early 
adopt IFRS 16 Leases from 1 January 2018. The Group continues to refine its procedures in applying IFRS 15 and IFRS 16 and 
has not yet finalised the testing and assessment of controls over its new processes for collating the necessary data required. 
As a result of this ongoing work, it is possible that there may be some changes to the anticipated impact summarised below.
1.14.2 IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers
IFRS 15 establishes a single comprehensive framework for entities to use in accounting for revenue arising from contracts 
with customers. IFRS 15 will supersede the current revenue recognition guidance including IAS 18 Revenue, IAS 11 
Construction Contracts and the related interpretations when it becomes effective.
The core principle of IFRS 15 is that an entity should recognise revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services 
to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those 
goods or services. Specifically, the Standard introduces a 5-step approach to revenue recognition:
Step 1: Identify the contract(s) with a customer
Step 2: Identify the performance obligations in the contract
Step 3: Determine the transaction price
Step 4: Allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract
Step 5: Recognise revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation is satisfied i.e. when ‘control’ of the 
goods or services underlying the particular performance obligation is transferred to the customer.
Prescriptive guidance has been provided by IFRS 15 for specific scenarios and extensive disclosures are required.
The Group has performed a preliminary assessment of the impact of adoption of IFRS 15 on each of the revenue streams, 
affected cost areas and Statement of Financial Position and summarised the main impacts below. The Group’s detailed 
assessment and testing over its new processes for collating the data required to account for revenue under IFRS 15 is 
ongoing, therefore it is possible that there could be differing impacts than summarised below.
i. Core Services
For Core Service revenues, based on its assessment to date, the Group has identified two main areas where the accounting 
treatment will change upon application of IFRS 15.
The main impact will be in relation to the provision of broadband routers within broadband service contracts. Under the 
current accounting policy, revenue recognised in relation to the provision of such assets is based on the corresponding 
customer charge when the asset is transferred to the customer. Generally, these assets are provided for free. Under IFRS 15, 
additional revenue will be allocated to all routers with reference to the asset’s relative standalone value within the contract, 
regardless of contract pricing. As a result, on adoption of IFRS 15, there will be an acceleration of revenue for these items, 
with a corresponding reduction in ongoing service revenue over the contract period. The difference between the revenue 
and the customer charge will be recognised as a contract asset on the balance sheet.
For connection fee income associated with Fixed Line Services, Data Services and Broadband Services, the Group has 
preliminary assessed that such connection fees are not separate from the provision of the underlying service, accordingly, 
revenue will be recognised for this single performance obligation when control over the service is transferred to the customer.
The term in which connection fees are deferred over will differ from the current accounting treatment. Connection fee 
income is currently deferred over a period judged to equate to the average life of a customer. On application of IFRS 15, 
connection fee income will be deferred over the contract term, where there are enforceable rights and obligations held by 
the customer and the Group respectively. 76

1.14.2 IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers continued
ii. Mobile
For Mobile revenues, based on its assessment to date, the Group expects the application of IFRS 15 to have a significant 
impact in this area.
The most significant impact is in relation to the provision of handsets or other related hardware items within post pay 
contracts. Under the current accounting policy, revenue recognised in relation to the provision of such assets is based on the 
corresponding customer charge when the asset is transferred to the customer. Generally, these assets are either provided 
for free or for a small upfront charge. Under IFRS 15, additional revenue will be allocated to all handsets and related hardware 
items with reference to the asset’s relative standalone value within the contract, regardless of contract pricing. As a result,  
on adoption of IFRS 15, there will be an acceleration of revenue for these items, with a corresponding reduction in ongoing 
service revenue over the contract period. The difference between the revenue and the customer charge will be recognised 
as a contract asset on the balance sheet.
iii. Global Solutions
For revenues arising from the Global Solutions revenue stream, based on its assessment to date the Group expects there to 
be no significant impact on application of IFRS 15.
The Directors have considered the entity’s contracts in the context of the new guidance within IFRS 15 specifically around 
principal versus agent considerations. It is concluded that in these arrangements the entity is principal which is consistent 
with the current accounting treatment.
iv. Data Centre
For Data Centre revenues, based on its assessment to date, the Group expects there to be no significant impact on 
application of IFRS 15.
The main area to be impacted is within managed service contracts which contain provision of hardware. For these contracts 
it is considered that the hardware does not constitute a separate performance obligation and therefore the associated 
revenue should be recognised over the contract term.
v. Other Revenues
For revenues included within the Other Revenue stream, based on its assessment to date, the Group does not expect there 
to be a significant impact on the Group’s financial statements on application of IFRS 15.
The main consideration for this revenue stream is around the provision of hardware to customers. Such contracts will be 
reviewed on a contract by contract basis to consider the guidance offered by IFRS 15 in relation to principal versus agent.  
It is expected that there will be a change in accounting for some contracts where the current accounting policy would be to 
recognise the sale and associated cost on a gross basis with the entity as principal in the arrangement. Application of IFRS 15 
may result in the entity being recognised as agent in the arrangement with the net revenue recognised in the Group’s 
financial statements.
vi. Commission expenses
Under the Group’s current accounting policy, sales commission costs directly related with obtaining a contract are expensed 
when incurred. However, IFRS 15 requires the recognition of an asset for those costs that are incremental to obtain a contract 
and to be subsequently amortised over the associated contract term.
vii. T ransition
IFRS 15 allows for two transition methods, either the full retrospective method or the modified retrospective method with the 
cumulative effect from initial application recognised as an adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings at the 
date of initial application. The Directors intend to use the modified retrospective method of transition to IFRS 15.
The process of implementing the new requirements involves changes within the Group’s current accounting processes and 
systems. The above disclosure of expected changes in accounting policies are based on assessments undertaken to date 
and are subject to change until the Group presents its first financial statements under IFRS 15 as the Group finalises its 
detailed assessment and refines its processes and controls. 77

1.14.3 IFRS 16 Leases
IFRS 16 introduces a comprehensive model for the identification of lease arrangements and accounting treatments for both 
lessors and lessees. IFRS 16 replaces existing leases guidance, including IAS 17 and the related interpretations when it 
becomes effective.
The standard is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2019. Early adoption is permitted for entities that 
apply IFRS 15 at or before the date of initial application of IFRS 16. The Group has elected to early adopt the standard being 
effective from reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018.
IFRS 16 distinguishes leases and service contracts on the basis of whether an identified asset is controlled by a customer. 
Distinctions of operating leases (off balance sheet) and finance leases (on balance sheet) are removed for lessee accounting, 
and is replaced by a model where a right-of-use asset and a corresponding liability have to be recognised for all leases by 
lessees (i.e. all on balance sheet) except for short-term leases and leases of low value assets.
The right-of-use asset is initially measured at cost and subsequently measured at cost (subject to certain exceptions) less 
accumulated depreciation and impairment losses, adjusted for any remeasurement of the lease liability. The lease liability is 
initially measured at the present value of the lease payments that are not paid at that date. Subsequently, the lease liability is 
adjusted for interest and lease payments, as well as the impact of lease modifications, amongst others. Furthermore, the 
classification of cash flows will also be affected as operating lease payments under IAS 17 are presented as operating cash 
flows; whereas under the IFRS 16 model, the lease payments are split into a principal and an interest portion which will be 
presented as financing and operating cash flows respectively.
Extensive disclosures are required by IFRS 16.
The Group has completed an initial assessment of the potential impact on its consolidated financial statements but has not 
yet completed its detailed assessment. It is anticipated that there will be a significant impact on the accounts recognised in 
the Group’s financial statements. The Group will recognise new assets and liabilities for its site sharing arrangements, car 
parking sub-leases and shop premises. As at 31 December 2017, the Group’s future minimum lease payments under non-
cancellable operating leases amounted to £3,146,000 (2016: £3,247,000) on an undiscounted basis (see note 19).
In addition, the nature of expenses related to those leases will now change as IFRS 16 replaces the straight-line operating 
lease expense with a depreciation charge for right-of-use assets and interest expense on lease liabilities.
The Group does not expect the adoption of IFRS 16 to impact its ability to comply with the revised maximum leverage 
threshold loan covenant described in Note 13.
As a lessee, the Group can either apply the standard using a:
 – retrospective approach; or
 – modified retrospective approach with optional practical expedients.
The lessee applies the election consistently to all of its leases.
The Group plans to apply IFRS 16 initially on 1 January 2018, using the modified retrospective approach. Therefore, the 
cumulative effect of adopting IFRS 16 will be recognised as an adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings  
at 1 January 2018, with no restatement of comparative information.
When applying the modified retrospective approach to leases previously classified as operating leases under IAS 17, the 
lessee can elect, on a lease-by-lease basis, whether to apply a number of practical expedients on transition. The Group  
is assessing the potential impact of using these practical expedients.
The Group is continuing its analysis of the expected impacts of the transition to IFRS 16.
Beyond the information above, it is not practicable to provide a reasonable estimate of the effect of these Standards until  
a detailed review has been completed. 78

1.15 Government grants
Government grants are recognised where there is a reasonable assurance that the grant will be received and all attached 
conditions complied with. When the grant relates to an expense item, it is recognised as income over the period necessary 
to match the grant on a systematic basis to the costs that it is intended to compensate.
Where the grant relates to an asset, it is recognised as a reduction in the carrying amount of the asset. The grant is then 
recognised as income over the useful life of a depreciable asset by way of a reduced depreciation charge.
1.16 Subscriber acquisition costs
Subscriber acquisition costs, which include the commission costs associated with acquiring new subscribers and other 
incremental costs of customer acquisition, are charged to the statement of comprehensive income as incurred.
1.17 Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty
In the application of the Group’s accounting policies, the Directors are required to make judgements, estimates and 
assumptions about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. The estimates 
and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and other factors that are considered to be relevant. Actual 
results may differ from these estimates.
The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are 
recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period, or in the period of the 
revision and future periods if the revision affects both current and future periods.
Management consider the key estimates and judgements used in the preparation of these financial statements to be:
 – Pension scheme assumptions used in the actuarial valuation prepared by independent actuaries Towers Watson for the 
financial year ended 31 December 2017 (and 31 December 2016). During 2011, the Isle of Man Government confirmed the 
use of CPI as the base index for pension scheme increases where the scheme provisions make direct reference to UK (as 
opposed to Isle of Man) statutory pension increase provisions. After taking legal advice, the trustees made the decision  
to reference CPI for pension increases in deferment for all sections, reference CPI for A/B section pension increases and 
reference RPI for section C pension increases. The Group’s defined benefit obligation is discounted at a rate set by 
reference to market yields at the end of the reporting period on high quality corporate bonds. Significant judgement is 
required when setting the criteria for bonds to be included in the population from which the yield curve is derived. The 
most significant criteria considered for the selection of bonds include the issue size of the corporate bonds, the quality  
of the bonds, and the identification of outliers which are excluded.
 – Recoverability of receivables (for further details on credit risk related to trade receivables see note 18(b), for details of 
provisions in respect of doubtful debts see note 11).
 – Useful lives for property, plant and equipment. Property, plant and equipment represents 32% (2016: 32%) of the Group’s 
total assets; estimates and assumptions made regarding their useful economic lives may have a material impact on their 
carrying value and related depreciation charge. The depreciation charge for an asset is derived using estimates of its 
useful economic life and expected residual value, which are reviewed annually and changed when necessary to reflect 
current thinking on the remaining lives in light of technological change, network investment plans and the condition  
of the assets concerned.
 – Impairment of goodwill arising on acquisition of Manx Telecom Trading Limited. The Group has only one cash-generating 
unit to which goodwill has been allocated, the investment in Manx Telecom Trading Limited. The recoverable amount  
of the investment in Manx Telecom Trading Limited has been determined based on an estimate of the fair value of Manx 
Telecom Trading Limited less costs of disposal. The key assumptions and estimates used in performing the annual 
impairment review are disclosed in note 3.
 – Fair value measurements and valuation processes. Some of the Group’s assets and liabilities are measured at fair value for 
financial reporting purposes. In estimating the fair value of an asset or liability the Group uses market observable data to the 
extent it is available. Where level 1 inputs are not available, the Group engages third party valuers to perform the valuation. 
Further information about the fair value assumptions are included in the following notes:
 – Note 7 – Property, plant and equipment.
 – Note 18 – Financial instruments (derivative financial instruments).
 – Note 23 – Share-based payments. 79

1.18 Business combinations
The Group accounts for business combinations using the acquisition method when control is transferred to the Group. The 
consideration transferred in the acquisition is generally measured at fair value, as are the identifiable net assets acquired. Any 
goodwill that arises is tested annually for impairment. Any gain on a bargain purchase is recognised in profit or loss immediately.
Transaction costs are expensed as incurred, except if related to the issue of debt or equity securities.
The consideration transferred does not include amounts related to the settlement of pre-existing relationships. Such 
amounts are generally recognised in profit or loss.
Any contingent consideration is measured at fair value at the date of acquisition. If an obligation to pay contingent 
consideration that meets the definition of a financial instrument is classified as equity, then it is not remeasured and 
settlement is accounted for within equity. Otherwise, other contingent consideration is remeasured at fair value at each 
reporting date and subsequent changes in the fair value of the contingent consideration are recognised in profit or loss.
2 Operating segments
The Group has five reportable revenue segments which management report on and base their strategic decisions on:
Group 
2017 
£’000
Group 
2016 
£’000
Fixed Line, Broadband and Data 31,476 31,633
Mobile 19,878 20,155
Global Solutions 16,533 15,565
Data Centre 4,748 5,862
Other 5,856 7,608
78,491 80,823
The segmental analysis shows revenue classified according to market source. However, the Group is not structured on a 
divisional basis, and has functional departments, processes, assets and obligations which serve each of these revenue streams. 
These are not allocated in the financial reports received by the Board, and its decisions are not routinely based on any such 
identification. Consequently, the analysis shown above does not extend to any segmentation of profits and net assets.
The products and services included within each of the five segments are as follows:
Fixed Line, Broadband and Data includes revenues from ADSL and VDSL rental and connection charges, fixed line call 
charges, fixed line rental and connection charges, and private circuit rental and connection charges.
Mobile includes revenues from mobile calls, SMS and data charges, mobile rental charges, mobile handset and accessory 
sales, and roaming.
Global Solutions includes revenues from mobile termination, products such as Chameleon, strongest signal mobile, and 
M2M (machine to machine).
Data Centre includes revenues from hosting services provided.
Other includes kit sales, directory revenues, managed service rental charges and revenue from the provision of 
telecommunications software. 80

Carrying amount
As at 31 December 2017 87,911
As at 31 December 2016 87,911
On 29 June 2010, the Group acquired all of the ordinary shares in Manx Telecom Trading Limited for £133,800,000 satisfied 
in cash, giving rise to goodwill of £84,277,000.
On 1 December 2016, the Group acquired all of the ordinary shares in Partitionware Limited for £4,007,000 satisfied in cash, 
giving rise to goodwill of £3,634,000.
Goodwill is deemed to have an indefinite life and so is not subject to amortisation. An impairment review was undertaken 
as at the reporting date to determine whether any impairment has occurred. Upon review, the Board deemed that no 
impairment was necessary (2016: nil).
Goodwill is considered to be impaired if the carrying amount exceeds the recoverable amount. The recoverable amount of 
an asset is considered to be the higher of its fair value less costs of disposal and its value in use. The Group has performed 
its impairment review based on an assessment of the fair value less costs of disposal.
The key assumptions for the value in use calculations are those regarding the discount rate, growth rates and expected 
changes to selling prices and direct costs in the period.
The discount rate used reflects current market assessments of the time value of money. The growth rate used reflects 
an assessment of the long term growth prospects of the market the CGU’s operate in.
There is significant headroom in the Manx Telecom Trading Limited and Partitionware Limited. It is the Directors view that in 
the next financial year no reasonably possible changes in the key assumptions would cause the carrying amounts to exceed 
the recoverable amount.
Manx Telecom Trading Limited
The CGU to which goodwill has been allocated is the operations of Manx Telecom Trading Limited in its entirety due to the 
structure of the Company, which operates as one telecommunications business.
In 2017, the fair value less costs of disposal of Manx Telecom Trading Limited has been determined on a market approach 
by reference to the enterprise value of Manx Telecom plc, excluding the Fair Value less costs of disposal of Partitionware 
Limited (see below). The enterprise value of Manx Telecom plc is based on the market capitalisation of Manx Telecom plc 
as at 31 December 2017 (using the year end share price and shares in issue) plus debt. The enterprise value of Manx Telecom 
plc, adjusted for Partitionware Limited, is considered to provide a value comparable to that of Manx Telecom Trading Limited 
as, excluding Partitionware Limited, all the revenue-generating operations of the Group are contained within Manx Telecom 
Trading Limited. Using this methodology, fair value less costs to sell were considered to be higher than the total asset value, 
therefore no impairment was required. Management also performed an assessment of the fair value determined based on 
an income approach, using cash flows projected over a 20-year period, a growth rate of 1% per annum and an 7% discount 
rate. This approach also indicated that there was no impairment of goodwill. In 2016, the impairment review took the same 
approach, which also indicated that there was no impairment of goodwill.
Partitionware Limited
The CGU to which goodwill has been allocated is the operations of Partitionware Limited in its entirety due to the structure 
of the Company, which operates as one telecommunications solutions business. The fair value less costs of disposal of 
Partitionware Limited has been determined on an income approach using cash flows projected over a 20-year period, a 
growth rate of 1% per annum and an 7% discount rate. Using this methodology, fair value less costs to sell were considered 
to be higher than the total asset value, therefore no impairment was required. In 2016, the impairment review took the same 
approach, which also indicated that there was no impairment of goodwill. 81

6 Taxation
The Company’s profits are charged at the Isle of Man standard rate of 0% for 2017 (2016: 0%). Therefore, no provision has 
been made for taxation for 2017 (2016: £nil). Whilst the Group is required to apply Isle of Man Retail Tax to Isle of Man retail 
activity, profits from this revenue stream are not substantial enough to meet the taxable threshold. 82

The Group’s freehold land and buildings are stated at their revalued amounts, being the fair value at the date of revaluation, 
less any subsequent accumulated depreciation. A formal independent valuation of the four main properties and various 
telephone exchange sites owned by the Group was undertaken in 2016 by Black Grace Cowley, independent valuers not 
related to the Group. Black Grace Cowley are RICS Registered Valuers and have appropriate qualifications and recent 
experience in the fair value measurement of properties in the Isle of Man. Their valuation conforms to RICS Valuation – 
Professional Standards (January 2014, revised April 2015) including UKVS1, Valuation of Real Property, Plant and Equipment 
for Financial Statements and International Financial Reporting Standards. The fair value of the freehold land and buildings 
was determined based on the market comparable approach that reflects recent transaction prices for similar properties. 
Changes in these market conditions could have a corresponding impact on the fair value of the properties held. 83

7 Property, plant and equipment – Group continued
As at the end of the reporting period, the Group performed an assessment of the estimated fair value of land and buildings, 
using the valuation techniques described above, which estimated that the fair value did not materially differ from the 
carrying value and, as such, a revaluation of the land and buildings was not required. There has been no change to the 
valuation techniques used during the year. A full, independent third party valuation was not undertaken as at 31 December 
2017 following the fair value estimates made by the Group.
The carrying value of land and buildings held by the Group under the revaluation model is the same as if it were held under 
the historical cost model.
In 2017, following continued investment in the Group’s mobile network and equipment and platforms used to support Data 
Centre services, the Group made impairments of certain property, plant and equipment no longer in use with a net book 
value of £102,000 (2016: £464,000).
In 2017, the Group made a net profit on disposal of certain fixed assets of £100,000 (2016: £36,000).
The accounting policies set out in note 1.6 are applicable to assets under construction, and the capital commitments in 
respect of assets under construction are detailed in note 22.

During the current year, the investment by the Company in Trafford Shareholder Debtco Limited increased by £303,000 
(2016: £889,000) due to capital contributions made in respect of share-based payments to be settled in the equity 
instruments of the Company for services received by Manx Telecom Trading Limited, which resulted in capital contributions 
being made to subsidiaries throughout the Group structure.
On 5 May 2017, the Group’s subsidiary, Goshawk Communications Limited, a company incorporated in the Isle of Man, 
acquired 100% of the issued share capital of Goshawk Communications (UK) Limited (“Goshawk”) in exchange for 33% of the 
issued share capital of Goshawk Communications Limited. As a result of the share for share exchange, the Group has a 67% 
shareholding in Goshawk Communications Limited, which in turn owns 100% of Goshawk (see note 26 for further information).

In connection with the Admission on 10 February 2014, Manx Telecom Holdings Limited and Manx Telecom Trading Limited 
entered into an £80m revolving credit facility agreement on 3 February 2014 with Barclays Bank plc, Lloyds Bank plc and  
The Royal Bank of Scotland plc as arrangers and Lloyds Bank plc as agent and security agent (‘the Facility Agreement’). 86
manx telecom plc 
annual report and accounts 2017
notes continued
13  Interest-bearing borrowings – Group continued
The proceeds of the first drawdown under the Facility Agreement of £70m were used to (among other things) refinance  
the indebtedness existing at 31 December 2013 and to pay fees, costs and expenses in relation to the Admission process 
and the debt refinancing. Additional amounts may be drawn under the Facility Agreement for general corporate purposes 
and/or working capital purposes and the payment of fees, costs and expenses.
The loan is secured by way of a debenture in favour of the security agent providing a fixed and floating charge over certain  
of the Group’s assets, including the shares of Manx Telecom Holdings Limited and Manx Telecom Trading Limited and the 
property, plant and equipment of the Group.
On 30 June 2015, the Group extended the term of the revolving credit facility agreement by a further two years, from  
30 June 2018 to 30 June 2020. In connection with the modification to the lending arrangements, the Group also negotiated  
a reduction in the applicable margin range, based on the ratio of total net debt to adjusted EBITDA, from 2.0% p.a. to 3.5% 
p.a., to 1.5% p.a. to 3% p.a. As at 31 December 2016 and 31 December 2017, the margin applicable to the interest rate on  
the facility was 1.5%. The amended terms of the lending arrangement were not considered to be substantially different from 
the original terms, and, as such the Group did not treat the modification as an extinguishment of the original financial liability 
and the recognition of a new liability, in line with its accounting policy (see note 1.4).
On 28 December 2017, Lloyds Bank plc, as arranger, novated its portion of the loan to DNB Bank ASA whilst remaining agent 
and security agent.
Transaction costs incurred as part of the debt financing are amortised over the period of the loan. Transaction costs of 
£1,475,000 were capitalised in 2014 and will be amortised over the loan period (as amended from 30 June 2015). Transaction 
costs incurred due to amendment to the facility in 2015 of £438,000 were capitalised in 2015, and these expenses, together 
with the remaining unamortised element of the initial capitalised expenses, will be amortised over the amended loan term.
To mitigate the Group’s exposure to interest rate risk, the Group has entered into interest swap agreements. See note 18(d) 
for further details of the interest swap agreements.
Amounts drawn under the Facility Agreement are to be repaid on the last day of each applicable interest period unless the 
relevant borrower elects otherwise, and amounts repaid will (subject to certain drawdown conditions) remain available for 
redrawing unless cancelled. The Facility Agreement will terminate, and all amounts outstanding must be repaid, on 30 June 2020.
The Facility Agreement also provides for the payment of a commitment fee, agency fee and arrangement fee, and contains 
certain undertakings, guarantees and covenants (including financial covenants) and provides for certain events of default. During 
both the current and prior periods, the Group has not breached any financial covenants contained within the Facility Agreement.

During 2016, the Group committed to a plan to restructure the business as part of the Transformation Programme. The 
restructuring provision relates to employee termination benefits, consulting fees and other costs of the Transformation 
Programme. Estimated costs were based on the terms of relevant contracts. As at 31 December 2017, 99% of affected 
employees had left the Group’s employment.
16  Retirement benefit obligations – Group
The Group operates two pension schemes. The Manx Telecom Limited Combined Pension Scheme is a defined benefit 
scheme that is closed to new entrants, and the Manx Telecom Employee Retirement Plan is a defined contribution plan.
Defined benefit plan
The Manx Telecom Limited Combined Pension Scheme (‘the Scheme’) provides benefits based on final pensionable salary. 
The assets of the Scheme are managed by independent Trustees and are held separately from those of the Group with 
managed portfolios with Legal and General and Invesco. The Scheme also utilises cash deposits.
The Isle of Man does not have minimum funding requirements. The only requirement is for a Schedule of Contributions, 
agreed between the Company and the Trustees, to be put in place after each actuarial valuation that is deemed by the 
Actuary to be sufficient to cover any shortfall revealed by the triennial actuarial valuation.
The contributions relating to the Scheme have been assessed in accordance with the advice of independent qualified 
actuaries, and are funded by the Group. Independent actuarial valuations are carried out on a triennial basis by Towers 
Watson (formerly Watson Wyatt LLP), Actuaries and Consultants. The last such full valuation was carried out at 31 March 2016 
and, in accordance with IAS 19, the defined benefit liabilities were measured using the ‘projected unit method’.
The Group paid contributions of £600,000 (2016: £1,203,000) with employee contributions of £nil (2016: £nil) to the Manx 
Telecom Combined Pension Scheme for the financial year ended 31 December 2017.
With effect from 1 October 2009 the Scheme changed to a career average revalued earnings basis for benefits earned from 
that date. Members had the option of choosing between a normal retirement age of 62 with an 8% employee contribution 
rate, or a normal retirement age of 65 with a 6% employee contribution rate. No changes were made to benefits earned 
before 1 October 2009. The Scheme was closed to new entrants in 2002.
On 31 August 2014, the Manx Telecom Combined Pension Scheme closed to future accrual. Under the terms of the plan 
amendment to close the Scheme to future accrual, participants in the Scheme were provided with a choice of three options 
regarding transition to the Manx Telecom Employee Retirement Plan.
The actuarial valuation of the Manx Telecom Limited Combined Pension Scheme as at 31 March 2016 has been updated  
to 31 December 2017. Scheme assets are stated at fair value. 88

The main assumptions adopted for the Scheme under IAS 19 (per annum) are as follows:
2017 
%
2016 
%
Nominal rate of increase for in-payment benefits 2.25-3.00 2.35-3.05
Nominal rate of increase for deferred benefits 2.25 2.35
Average longevity of a member at age 60 now (years) – males 27.4 27.3
Average longevity of a member at age 60 now (years) – females 29.6 29.4
Average longevity of a member at age 60 in 20 years – males 29.7 29.6
Average longevity of a member at age 60 in 20 years – females 32.0 31.9
Discount rate 2.40 2.55
Retail Price Index (‘RPI’) 3.25 3.35
Consumer Price Index (‘CPI’) 2.25 2.35
Rate of salary increase N/A N/A
During 2011, the Isle of Man Government confirmed the use of CPI as the base index for pension scheme increases 
where the scheme provisions make direct reference to UK (as opposed to Isle of Man) statutory pension increase provisions. 
After taking legal advice, the trustees made the decision to reference CPI for pension increases in deferment for all sections, 
reference CPI for A/B section pension increases, and reference RPI for section C pension increases.
The risks associated with the actuarial assumptions include longevity, inflation, interest rate and market (investment) risks. 
The Scheme is not exposed to any unusual, entity or scheme-specific risks.
Each year, the trustees of the Scheme review the strategic investment policies of the Scheme in terms of the risk and return 
profiles. The main strategic choices that are formulated are the asset mix. The Scheme does not utilise annuities or swaps 
to manage risk in relation to asset liability matching.
The Scheme holds a large proportion of equities which are expected to outperform bonds in the long term but give 
exposure to volatility and risk in the short term. The Trustees are responsible for investment strategy, and a reasonable 
proportion of equity investment is justified, given the time horizon of the Scheme and in order to provide a reasonable 
long-term return. If equity investments were to fall by 20%, the fair value of the Scheme’s assets would reduce by 
approximately £4,600,000 which would result in a net defined benefit liability of £8,400,000.
However, a fall in equity prices would be associated with a fall in the value of corporate bonds and a rise in corporate 
bond yields. The former would lead to a further reduction in Scheme assets, around £9,100,000 of which were invested 
in corporate bonds at 31 December 2017. However, the increase in corporate bond yields, which are used to determine 
the value of the defined benefit obligation, would lead to a reduction in liabilities, which would partially or wholly offset 
the impact of the fall in asset values on the reported pension liability. 89

Service cost N/A N/A N/A N/A N/A
Net interest cost +100 –600 +200 N/A +100
Changes are marked ‘N/A’ above as there would be no financial impact if the salary escalation assumption is varied, given 
the Scheme is closed to future accrual. Similarly, there would also be no financial impact on the service cost.
In presenting the sensitivity analysis above, the present value of the defined benefit obligation has been calculated using  
the projected unit method, which is the same as that applied in calculating the defined benefit obligation liability recognised  
in the statement of financial position. The sensitivity analysis was conducted by altering and measuring the impact each 
assumption had on the level of expected future cash flows and discounting back to the valuation data.
There was no change in the methods and assumptions used in preparing the sensitivity analysis from prior years with  
the exception of the mortality assumption, which is updated to reflect the latest available published tables and future 
projections to mortality. The sensitivity analysis presented above may not be representative of the actual change in  
the defined benefit obligation, as it is unlikely that the change in assumptions would occur in isolation of one another,  
as some of the assumptions may be correlated. Extrapolation beyond the sensitivity figures shown may not be appropriate. 90

On 3 July 2017 , £18,343,000 of investments were transferred from Legal and General to Invesco Perpetual. Therefore, as at 
31 December 2017 , assets of the scheme are held within managed portfolios with Legal & General and Invesco Perpetual and 
are therefore indirectly invested in assets in quoted markets with active prices. The assets held directly with Invesco Perpetual 
and Legal & General are invested in funds for which regular quoted prices are readily available and for which transactions 
regularly occur and are therefore classified as level 1 instruments in the fair value hierarchy (see note 1.4 for further information 
on the fair value hierarchy).

Benefits paid (4,295) (2,700)
At end of year 92,105 90,900
The defined benefit scheme’s impact on the Group’s future cash flows is affected by:
 – Funding policy and arrangements – the Isle of Man does not have minimum funding requirements. A Schedule of 
Contributions is agreed between the Group and the Trustees and put in place following each successive actuarial 
valuation that is deemed by the actuary to be sufficient to cover any shortfall revealed by the triennial valuation.
 – Contributions to the Scheme for the next annual reporting period – expected employer contributions for the year  
ended 31 December 2017 are £600,000, and expected benefit payments from Scheme assets are £2,200,000.
 – Timing of benefit payments and duration of the defined benefit obligation – the weighted average duration of the 
defined benefit obligation is 22.0 years (2016: 22.0 years), and benefit payments are expected as set out in the below 
maturity profile.

payments to shareholders, return capital to shareholders, or issue new shares. The Group ensures that banking covenants 
are met as part of its capital management; see note 13 for further details of the Group’s lending arrangements, including

Financial risk management
The Group’s operations expose it to a variety of financial risks, including credit risk, currency risk, interest rate risk and 
liquidity risk. The Group’s overall risk management policies focus on the unpredictability of financial markets and seek 
to minimise potential adverse effects on the Group’s financial performance and net assets. 94
manx telecom plc 
annual report and accounts 2017
notes continued
18  Financial instruments continued
The principal financial risks of the Group and how the Group manages these risks are discussed below.
18(b) Credit risk
Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its 
contractual obligations, and arises principally from the Group’s receivables due from customers and cash and cash equivalents.
Trade receivables are presented in the statement of financial position net of allowances for doubtful receivables, estimated 
by the Group’s management based on prior experience and their assessment of the current economic environment. 
Management has a credit policy in place, and the exposure to credit risk is monitored on an ongoing basis using credit 
checks. The Group manages its exposure to credit risk on cash and cash equivalents by only placing its financial assets 
with reputable financial institutions with strong credit ratings.
At the reporting date, there were no significant concentrations of third-party credit risk, with exposure spread over a large 
number of counterparties and customers. The maximum exposure to credit risk is represented by the carrying amount of 
each financial asset, including derivative financial instruments, in the statement of financial position. The Group does not 
require collateral in respect of financial assets.
The carrying amount of financial assets represents the maximum credit exposure. Therefore, the maximum exposure to 
credit risk at 31 December 2017 was £40,867,000 (2016: £39,904,000), being the total of the carrying amount of cash and cash 
equivalents, trade and other receivables and related party receivables.
The aging of trade receivables, including trade receivables past due but not impaired, is as follows:
Overdue on the reporting date

For those debtors which are not impaired and which are overdue at the reporting date, there has been no indication that 
their payment obligations will not be met.
18(c) Liquidity risk
Prudent liquidity risk management implies maintaining sufficient cash for the Group to meet its obligations. The Group aims to 
maintain appropriate liquidity through the regular monitoring of its actual and projected cash position. Mitigation of liquidity risk  
is also provided by the undrawn amount of £10,000,000 under the revolving credit facility described in note 13, and by the use of 
interest rate swaps to partially offset interest rate movements impacting variable rate loans and borrowings. 95

18(d) Market risk
Market risk is the risk that changes in market prices, such as foreign exchange rates, interest rates and equity prices, will 
affect the Group’s income or the value of its holdings of financial instruments.
The Group incurs foreign currency risk on purchases that are denominated in currency other than sterling. However, the 
Group’s exposure to currencies other than sterling is not considered to be material.
The Group’s exposure to the risk of changes in market interest rates relates primarily to bank loans borrowed at floating 
interest rates. The terms of the bank loans and interest rates are disclosed in note 13.
Market risk – interest rate risk

Group agrees to exchange floating interest rates for fixed interest rates on agreed notional principal amounts. 96

Lloyds Bank PLC 1.698 30/06/2020 50,000 (960)
(1,912)
The net movement in unrealised gains/(losses) on interest rate swaps in the year gave rise to a gain of £777,000 in the current 
year (2016: loss of £1,238,000). 
Sensitivity analysis
If interest rates had been 100 basis points higher, the Group’s profit for the year ended 31 December 2017 would have 
increased by £916,000 (2016: increase £1,447,000). If interest rates had been 100 basis points lower, the Group’s profit for the 
year ended 31 December 2017 would have decreased by £916,000 (2016: decrease £1,447,000). This calculation assumes that 
the change occurred across the whole period and had been applied to risk exposures existing at the year end which were 
either not fixed or had not been mitigated by interest rate swaps.
This analysis assumes that all other variables, in particular foreign currency rates, remained constant, and considers the effect 
of financial instruments with variable interest rates and financial instruments at fair value through profit or loss (the fixed rate 
element of interest rate swaps).
Fair value hierarchy
The table below analyses financial instruments carried at fair value, grouped into Levels 1 to 3 based on the degree to 
which the fair value is observable (as described in the accounting policy in note 1.4). Interest rate swaps are valued using 
discounted cash flows, under which future cash flows are estimated based on forward interest rate yields (from observable 
yield curves at the end of the reporting period) and contract interest rates.

Co-investment plan (‘CIP’)
Under the CIP established in connection with the Admission, on 10 February 2014 the Executive Directors of the Company 
received a total of 538,114 conditionally awarded shares, and other directors of Manx Telecom Trading Ltd (classified under  
IAS 24 as ‘Key Management’) received a total of 376,773 conditionally awarded shares, in both cases on the basis of a matching 
award of one share for every two invested shares then held by them. Such matching shares will only vest to the extent that  
the individual remains employed by the Group and that invested shares remain held by the participant on 10 February 2017 , 
and are also subject to satisfaction of a three-year relative Total Shareholder Return performance condition.
On 9 February 2015, the terms of the three-year relative Total Shareholder Return performance condition were modified to 
align the opening share price to the IPO placed at £1.42p per share. This will give rise to a total additional expense of £180,000 
over the vesting period. On 4 June 2015, the service conditions of the award previously made to Mike Dee as Chief Executive 
Officer were modified such that the total award was reduced by one third as a consequence of his retirement, while retaining 
the existing performance conditions.
On 10 February 2017 , on satisfaction of the service and performance conditions including modifications, 756,350 shares vested.
The total expense recognised by the Group in respect of the CIP for the year ended 31 December 2017 was £26,000 
(2016: £236,000).
Long-term incentive plan (‘LTIP’)
In 2015, the Group established an LTIP for Key Management of the Group. On 11 May 2015, 288,532 share awards were 
granted under the plan. Executive Directors of the Company received a total of 95,576 share awards. The share awards  
will only vest to the extent that the individual remains employed by the Group on 10 May 2018, and are also subject to the 
Group results satisfying three-year cumulative non-market performance conditions.
The estimated fair value of options granted in 2015 was £1.905 per share. The aggregate of the estimated fair value  
of the options granted in 2015 under the LTIP , which is to be recognised on a straight line basis over the vesting period,  
was £550,000. Due to forfeiture of awards, and based on a reduced vesting percentage as a result of non-market performance 
conditions, the revised estimate at 31 December 2017 was £240,000.
On 28 January 2016, 62,732 share awards were granted under the plan. Executive Directors of the Company received a total  
of 56,361 share awards. The share awards will only vest to the extent that the individual remains employed by the Group  
on 27 January 2019, and are also subject to the Group results satisfying three-year cumulative non-market performance 
conditions. The estimated fair value of the options granted was £2.035, and the aggregate of the estimated fair value of the 
options, which will be recognised over the vesting period was £128,000. Due to forfeiture of awards, and based on a reduced 
vesting percentage as a result of non-market performance conditions, the revised estimate at 31 December 2017 was £62,000.
On 4 July 2016, 457 ,922 share awards were granted under the plan. Executive Directors of the Company received a total of 
250,374 share awards. The share awards will only vest to the extent that the individual remains employed by the Group on 
11 July 2019, and are also subject to the Group results satisfying three-year cumulative non-market performance conditions. 
The estimated fair value of the options granted was £1.98, and the aggregate of the estimated fair value of the options, which 
will be recognised over the vesting period. was £907 ,000. Due to forfeiture of awards, the revised estimate at 31 December 2017 
was £510,000.
On 4 July 2017, 480,832 share awards were granted under the plan. Executive Directors of the Company received a total  
of 265,017 share awards. The share awards will only vest to the extent that the individual remains employed by the Group on 
6 July 2020, and are also subject to the Group results satisfying three-year cumulative market and non-market performance 
conditions. The estimated fair value of the options granted was £1.88, and the aggregate of the estimated fair value of the 
options to be recognised over the vesting period, was £590,000. Due to forfeiture of awards during the year, the revised 
estimate at 31 December 2017 was £365,000.
The fair value of the awards, with the exception of those granted in 2017, has been estimated using a Black-Scholes method, 
the inputs for which are detailed below. Awards granted in 2017 have been estimated using both a Black-Scholes method 
and a Monte Carlo method; 50% of the shares are subject to a market-based performance condition and 50% of the shares 
are subject to a non-market performance condition.
The total expense recognised by the Group in respect of the LTIP for the year ended 31 December 2017 was £76,000  
(2016: £373,000). As at 31 December 2017, the LTIP awards had a weighted average remaining contractual life of 1.51 years 
(2016: 1.51 years). 101

Save as you earn (‘SAYE’)
In October 2014, the Group established a SAYE scheme for employees of the Group based in the Isle of Man. The scheme 
was open for a limited period only during the year, and permits the granting of options to Isle of Man resident employees of 
the Group linked to a bank SAYE contract for a term of three years. Contributions from employees range from £10 to £500 
per month. Options may be exercised at the end of the three-year period at an exercise price of £1.40 per share if individuals 
continue to be employed by the Group at the maturity of the savings contract. The SAYE scheme contains provisions for 
‘good leavers’ as defined in the SAYE scheme, which enable ‘good leavers’ to exercise options under the savings contract at 
the date the participant ceases to hold employment with the Group. The options must be exercised within six months of the 
maturity of the savings contract, otherwise they lapse and the savings are returned to employees.
On 11 July 2016, a further 566,826 share options were granted under the scheme. These options may be exercised at the end 
of the contract term of three years, at an exercise price of £1.592 per shares.
On 1 December 2017 , the share options issued in 2014 vested, and 834,395 shares options were exercised, including those under 
good leaver provisions (2016: 13,570 share options under good leaver provisions), and 91.521 were forfeited (2016: 167 ,407 share 
options). In 2017 , 32,441 options were exercised under good leaver provisions in respect of the options issued in 2016, and 
109,058 options were forfeited.
At 31 December 2017, the options had a weighted average remaining contractual life of 1.01 years (2016: 1.41 years).
The estimated fair value of options granted in 2014 was £0.35 per share. The aggregate of the initial estimated fair value of 
the options granted in 2014 under the SAYE scheme was £422,000. The actual expense to have been recognised on a 
straight line basis over the vesting period is £370,000. The estimated fair value of options granted in 2016 was £0.37 per 
share. The aggregate of the initial estimated fair value of the options granted in 2016 under the SAYE scheme was £189,000, 
due to forfeiture of awards the revised estimate at 31 December 2017 was £130,000, which will be recognised on a straight-
line basis over the vesting period (subject to further revisions for the estimated number of shares expected to vest and 
cancellations). The fair value has been estimated using a Black-Scholes method, the inputs for which are detailed below.
The total expense recognised by the Group in respect of the SAYE scheme for the year ended 31 December 2017 was 
£149,000 (2016: £157,000).
An equivalent share option scheme for non-Isle of Man resident employees was established in 2015; see below.
Shadow save as you earn (‘Shadow SAYE’)
In 2015, the Group established a Shadow SAYE for employees of the Group based in the United Kingdom. The Shadow SAYE 
mirrors the terms of the SAYE. On 1 February 2015, 18,000 share options were granted. The estimated fair value of the 
options granted was £0.387 per share. During 2017, no shares were fortified (2016: 6,429 shares were forfeited). On 1 August 
2016, 2,827 shares options were granted, mirroring the terms of the SAYE options granted on 11 July 2016. No shares were 
fortified over 2017 or 2016. The estimated fair value of the options granted was £0.413 per share. The fair value has been 
estimated using a Black-Scholes method, the inputs for which are detailed below. At 31 December 2017, the options had a 
weighted average remaining contractual life of 0.38 years (2016: 1.38 years). The aggregate of the initial estimated fair value 
of the options granted in 2014 under the Shadow SAYE scheme was £7,000; due to forfeiture of awards, the revised estimate 
at 31 December 2017 was £4,000 which will be recognised on a straight-line basis over the vesting period. The aggregate of 
the initial estimated fair value of the options granted in 2016 under the Shadow SAYE scheme was £1,000, which will be 
recognised on a straight-line basis over the vesting period.
The total expense recognised by the Group in respect of the Shadow SAYE scheme for the year ended 31 December 2017 
was £2,000 (2016: £1,000). 102

Share incentive plan (‘SIP’)
In October 2014, the Group established a SIP for employees of the Group based in the Isle of Man. Under the SIP , all 
permanent Isle of Man resident employees of the Group as at 17 October 2014 were invited to receive 500 free shares 
each. 275 employees accepted the offer, resulting in 137,500 share options being granted on 1 December 2014.
The shares granted were issued and transferred by the Company to the Manx Telecom plc Share Incentive Plan Trust for nil 
consideration. The Manx Telecom plc Share Incentive Plan Trust is an employee benefit trust established by the Company 
to hold shares awarded under the SIP for the benefit of employees of the Group.
Options granted under the SIP may be exercised on 30 November 2017 if individuals either continue to be employed by the 
Group at that date or are considered to be ‘good leavers’ as defined in the SIP , at which point shares will be released from the 
Manx Telecom plc Share Incentive Plan Trust to the employee. During 2017 , 31,500 shares were exercised under good leaver 
provisions (2016: 500 shares), and 82,500 shares were exercised by individuals who continued to be employed by the Group.
On 7 November 2017, all permanent Isle of Man resident employees of the Group as at 6 November 2017 were invited 
to receive 250 free shares each. 258 employees accepted the offer, resulting in 62,801 share options being granted on 
4 December 2017.
The shares granted were issued and transferred by the Company to the Manx Telecom plc Share Incentive Plan Trust  
for nil consideration. Options granted under the SIP will be exercised on 3 December 2020 by individuals who continue  
to be employed by the Group at that date or are considered to be ‘good leavers’ as defined by the SIP , at which point the 
shares will be released from the Manx Telecom plc Share Incentive Plan Trust to the employee. During 2017, there were  
no shares exercised under good leaver provisions.
As at 31 December 2017, the aggregate of the estimated fair value of the options granted under the SIP was £325,000  
(2016: £208,000), which has been recognised on a straight-line basis over the vesting period. The fair value has been 
estimated using a Black-Scholes method, the inputs for which are detailed below.
The total expense recognised by the Group in respect of the SIP for the year ended 31 December 2017 was £57,000 
(2016: £74,000).
An equivalent cash settled share option scheme for non-Isle of Man resident employees was established in 2015, see below.
Recruitment Award
Pursuant to his employment contract, on 1 February 2016 an Executive Director of the Company became entitled to an 
award in respect of 49,140 ordinary shares of the Company. The award will only vest to the extent that the individual remains 
employed by the Group on 31 January 2018. During the year, the service condition was not met and, as a result, all share 
options were forfeited. The total expense reversal recognised by the Group in respect of the recruitment award was £46,000 
(2016: £46,000 expense).
Cash-settled share-based payments
In 2015, the Group established a shadow share incentive plan (‘Shadow SIP’) for employees of the Group based in the  
United Kingdom. The Shadow SIP mirrors the terms of the SIP , except that employees will be issued with the cash equivalent  
of 500 shares each on the vesting date. On 1 February 2015, 2,000 share options were granted. The estimated fair value  
of options granted was £1.815 per share. The fair value has been estimated using a Black-Scholes method, the inputs for 
which are detailed below. At 31 December 2017 , the options had a weighted average remaining contractual life of 0.08 years 
(2016: 1.08 years). The total expense in respect of cash-settled share-based payments for the year ended 31 December 2017  
was £1,000 (2016: £1,000).

1. Valuation model also used for the grant of additional shares on 4 June 2015.
2. A combination of Black-Scholes and Monte Carlo valuation methods has been used due to the existence of both market and non-market performance conditions.
Expected volatility would normally be determined by reference to share price movements (with dividends reinvested) over a 
period of time commensurate with the remaining performance period immediately prior to the date of grant. However, given 
that the Company was listed on 10 February 2014, there is insufficient data to calculate the volatility of the Company’s share 
price. Therefore, a proxy volatility figure has been used. The proxy volatility figure has been derived from the median 
volatility of the 11 companies in the comparator group for the TSR performance condition in the CIP (as at the grant date) 
over the relevant period.
A risk-free rate of 0% has been used for the CIP , LTIP , SIP and Shadow SIP , as the valuation of awards with no exercise price  
is not affected by the risk-free rate input, as no investment is required by the recipient and therefore no gain could be 
derived elsewhere.
The dividends that would be paid on a share in the period between grant and vesting reduce the fair value of an award if, in not 
owning the underlying shares, a participant does not receive the dividend income on these shares during the vesting period. An 
expected dividend yield of 0% has been used in respect of the CIP , LTIP , SIP and Shadow SIP as under these plans participants 
are entitled to receive an amount equal to the dividends payable to the vesting date. Accordingly, the dividend yield input has 
been set at nil so as not to discount for the loss of dividends. The expected yield used for the 2014 SAYE and 2015 Shadow SAYE 
schemes has been based on the share price on the grant date and the Company’s intention to maintain a dividend yield of 7%  
on the Admission placing price of £1.42 per share. The expected yield used for the 2016 SAYE and 2016 Shadow SAYE schemes 
has been based on the share price on the grant date and the annual dividend per share at the grant date.

The own shares held as detailed in note 17 are excluded from the calculation of the weighted average number of shares.
None of the instruments noted above which potentially dilute earnings per share have any effects recorded within profit or 
loss which may be saved upon exercise, therefore no adjustments to earnings have been made in the calculation of diluted 
earnings per share.
24.1 Reported earnings per share
The calculation of the reported earnings per share has been based on the weighted average number of shares outstanding 
during the period (as above) and the Profit/(loss) for the period after tax attributable to the owners of the Group (‘Earnings’).

after the reporting period and has not been included as a liability in these financial statements. The final dividend is payable 
to all shareholders on the Register of Members on 24 May 2018. The total dividend to be paid is 7.5p per share. The payment 
of this dividend will not have any tax consequences for the Group.
26  Acquisition of subsidiaries
On 5 May 2017, the Group’s subsidiary, Goshawk Communications Limited, a company incorporated in the Isle of Man, 
acquired 100% of the issued share capital of Goshawk Communications (UK) Limited (“Goshawk”) in exchange for 33%  
of the issued share capital of Goshawk Communications Limited.
As a result of the share for share exchange, the Group has a 67% shareholding in Goshawk Communications Limited,  
which in turn owns 100% of Goshawk.
Goshawk is a company which develops and exploits technology-based solutions that enhance audio quality. Goshawk  
was acquired in order to support the Group’s transformational growth strategy by developing disruptive technologies  
and bringing innovative products and services to the market. 105

– 1,668
The gain on bargain purchase arising from the acquisition of Goshawk is the result of nil consideration transferred and the 
fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired.
Acquisition related costs incurred in the period related to the acquisition of Goshawk (included in administrative expenses) 
amounted to £30,000. Acquisition related costs incurred in 2016 related to the acquisition of Partitionware (including 
administrative expenses) amounted to £161,000.
Goshawk contributed nil revenue and £111,000 of losses to the Group’s consolidated profit for the period between the date 
of acquisition on 5 May 2017 and the balance sheet date of 31 December 2017.
If the acquisition of Goshawk had been completed on the first day of the financial period, group revenues for the year to 
31 December 2017 would have been £20,000 more and group profit would have been £15,000 less. 
During the year, the Group paid £2,007,000 of deferred consideration in relation to the acquisition of Partitionware Limited  
in 2016.

28  Post-balance sheet events
The following significant events occurred after the year end date of 31 December 2017 and prior to the signing of this  
Annual Report on 2 May 2018:
 – a final dividend for the year ended 31 December 2017 was declared, as detailed, in note 25;
 – on 24 April 2018, the Remuneration Committee of the Company approved a fourth Long Term Incentive Plan for  
the Executive Directors of the Company and directors of the subsidiary Manx Telecom Trading Limited; and
 – on 7 March 2018, the Remuneration Committee of the Company approved a fourth Save As You Earn share option  
scheme for employees of the Group.
Other than as noted above, there are no events after the balance sheet date which require disclosure.
29  Alternative performance measures
The Directors of the Group have presented a number of additional performance measures which they believe are relevant  
to an understanding of the Group’s financial performance which are not defined in IFRS and are therefore termed ‘non-GAAP’ 
measures. The Group’s definition of these terms may not be comparable with similarly titled performance measures and 
disclosures by other entities. Such non-GAAP measures should not be viewed in isolation or as an alternative to the 
equivalent GAAP measure.
EBITDA
EBITDA is defined as the Group profit or loss before depreciation, amortisation, net finance expense and taxation. 
Underlying EBITDA is defined as EBITDA, adjusted for the specific items listed below. EBITDA is a common measure  
used by investors and analysts to evaluate the operating financial performance of companies, particularly in the 
telecommunications sector. The Directors consider EBITDA and underlying EBITDA to be useful measures of operating 
performance. This presentation is consistent with the way that financial performance is measured by management and 
reported internally and assists in providing a meaningful analysis of the trading results of the Group.

both of which are captions which exist on the statement of financial position. Net debt provides a single measure of the 
Group’s indebtedness and an indication of overall balance sheet strength.
A reconciliation from loans and other borrowings and cash and cash equivalents, the IFRS measures used to calculate Net

Underlying earnings per share
Earnings per share, both basic and diluted, are terms which are defined in IFRS. Underlying earnings per share, both basic and 
diluted are not terms defined by IFRS. They are calculated based upon underlying profit before tax (defined above) and the 
basic and diluted number of shares as determined for use in the terms defined in IFRS. Note 24.2 provides the components 
used in the calculation.
Specific items
Specific items are identified by virtue of their size, nature or incidence. In determining whether an event or transaction is 
specific, management considers quantitative as well as qualitative factors such as the frequency or predictability of occurrence.
Adjusting measures for specific items assists with the comparability of measures between reporting periods, as well as with 
removing volatility or distortions from significant events.
The adjustments made to reported profit before tax and operating profit are income and charges that are unpredictable in nature, 
significant, and distort the Group’s underlying performance. For the year ended 31 December 2017 , these adjustments included:
 – Transformation Programme. In 2016, the Group commenced a programme to transform the business, aimed at improving 
competitiveness and the customer experience by reshaping the organisation, streamlining processes, and investing in 
supporting technology. As part of this programme, costs of £3,863,000 were incurred to 31 December 2017 (2016: £4,335,000) 
relating to employee termination benefits, consulting fees and other programme-related costs.
 – Acquisition costs. Costs of £30,000 (2016: £161,000) were incurred in the acquisition of Goshawk Communications (UK) Limited 
in May 2017 and the acquisition of Partitionware in December 2016.
 – Loss on property revaluation. During 2016, the Group revalued land and buildings, with the revaluation of some properties 
resulting in a loss on revaluation of £1,274,000. There has been so such loss in the current year.
 – Unrealised gains and losses on interest rate swaps. In 2017 , the Group made an unrealised gain on interest rate swap fair value 
movements of £777 ,000 (2016: £1,238,000 loss).
 – Impairment of property, plant and equipment. Following continued investment in the Group’s mobile network and equipment 
and platforms used to support Data Centre services, the Group made impairments of certain property, plant and equipment 
no longer in use, resulting in an expense of £102,000 (2016: £464,000).
Additionally, there are the following adjustments to reported cash flows from operating activities and free cash flow that are 
unpredictable in nature, significant and distort the Group’s underlying performance:
 – Transformation Programme. The Group made cash outflows of £8,899,000 (2016: £495,000) in relation to the 
Transformation Programme costs described above.
 – Acquisition of subsidiary. The net cash outflow on the acquisition of Partitionware Limited was £2,007,000 (2016: 
£1,668,000), as detailed in note 26. In addition, the Group also made cash outflows of £30,000 in relation to acquisition 
costs (2016: £161,000). overview strategic report financial statements governance report other
