@DixonsCarphone  “This has been a terrific first year for Dixons Carphone. We have seen excellent increases  
in both sales and profitability and we have made very encouraging progress with the 
tricky job of integrating these two great companies. At the same time, we have continued 
to generate strong customer satisfaction numbers, made significant strides in our  
Connected World Services business including our agreement with Sprint, and launched  
a brand new mobile network. 
The job is far from done. I am acutely aware that there is no room for complacency  
in a sector which has seen unprecedented change, bringing both opportunities and  
challenges. We have set ourselves ambitious goals, not only financial, but also in terms  
of driving customer happiness, building a completely integrated company and delivering  
a brand new global services business with CWS. To achieve these, we will need to  
exhibit creativity, energy, resilience and toughness of purpose. Nevertheless we are very  
optimistic about the road ahead, and Dixons Carphone is lucky to have such a fantastic 
team of people – in every part of the business – to deliver these goals. My sincere  
thanks to them for everything that has been done so far.”

Chairman’s Statement 
4 
I am pleased to be reporting on a very encouraging first year 
since the merger of Carphone Warehouse and Dixons Retail. 
We have had a strong start, with pro forma Headline profit 
before tax rising 21% to £381 million. Progress has been good 
across the board and in virtually all territories, with excellent 
market share gains in all core countries in all key categories, 
and record customer satisfaction numbers. Some important 
strategic goals have also been achieved, most notably the 
disposals of non-core operations in France, Germany, the 
Netherlands and Portugal. In addition, it is good to see real 
traction with some key new clients in our Connected World 
Services business including our agreement with Sprint. In 
short, it has been a good year and the Board is pleased to 
recommend a final dividend of 6.0p per share to be paid on  
25 September 2015. 
At the same time, the team have made really good progress in 
bringing our two great companies together. Much has been 
achieved on this vital journey and, in particular, It gives me 
enormous pleasure to see so many fully-functioning Carphone 
Warehouse stores doing so well inside CurrysPCWorld stores 
up and down the country. I believe that the team are doing 
something that is both hard to do and relatively rare: creating  
a genuine merger of equals where the best parts of each 
company are preserved. 
While this is very encouraging so far, I am also aware that 
getting this right is not optional. We brought the businesses 
together because we believed that increasingly interconnected 
customers were going to require something new from us: a 
powerful partner to help them navigate these new technologies. 
Over the last year we have started to think about our customer 
needs very hard and how we will address them going forward 
– not only through the products that we offer, but also through 
the services that we believe will bring these products to life. 
This is a long-term strategy but I am convinced that it will  
bear fruit in the end and it is exciting to be at the forefront  
of these developments. 
In recent years we have experienced unprecedented changes 
in our marketplace, and this year is not shaping up to be an 
exception. There is no doubt that technology is evolving, 
consumer behaviour is shifting, the supplier landscape is 
changing and, of course, in the telecommunications world, that 
there are a number of important M&A transactions pending. 
We believe that change creates opportunity for us as 
consumers turn more and more to those who can offer 
genuine impartial advice and service at very competitive prices, 
and as suppliers rely more and more on us to tell their stories 
fairly and well to their customers. It is our job to make 
customers' lives better through technology, and, if we are 
successful, this will lead to continued growth and success for 
Dixons Carphone.  
Finally, I am conscious that all we have achieved – and all of 
our future – is down to the skills and commitment of our 
people. On behalf of the Board and our shareholders, I would 
like to thank them for their hard work and dedication.

Group Chief Executive’s Statement 
5 
I am very proud to be reporting on the first year of the newly 
merged Dixons Carphone Group. In eleven months we have 
established the new organisational structures of the Group,  
UK & Ireland, and Sweden, rolled out almost 250 Carphone 
Warehouse SWAS, exited retail operations in Germany and the 
Netherlands, signed material contracts in Connected World 
Services, and launched a new MVNO in the UK under the iD 
brand. More importantly, during this time we have also 
delivered very strong trading, taken market share in all 
territories and delivered record customer satisfaction right 
across the business. 
The business has also had a strong first year financially. We 
have delivered PBT ahead of guidance, increasing pro forma 
Headline PBT from £316 million to £381 million, resulting in  
an increase in pro forma Headline basic EPS from 20.5p to 
25.5p. Pro forma net debt is also lower than expectation at 
£260 million. 
In the UK & Ireland, like-for-like sales were up 8% (13% in Q4) 
and EBIT grew by 26% to £306 million, reflecting strong 
performances in both electricals and mobile. In electricals, 
white goods and TVs sold particularly well with customers 
responding to our range, pricing and - above all - service 
initiatives. Our mobile business in the UK & Ireland also saw 
very encouraging sales growth. Postpay volumes and market 
share continued to grow year-on-year in relatively quiet 
markets as the business benefited from the exit of Phones 4u 
and successful product launches. We are also - cautiously - 
encouraged by the impact on ARPU from higher levels of  
data usage.  
Also in the UK, we launched our new MVNO, iD, in May. 
Enabled by an innovative IT platform, it will target a number  
of specific customer segments, with a particular focus on 
personalising plans with flexible tariffs and introducing shared 
data tariffs, market-leading roaming and the re-introduction of - 
already very popular - 12 month contracts. iD will also be 
launching in Ireland later in the summer.  
Our Nordics business had a good year with like-for-like sales 
up 4%. EBIT declined in sterling by 16% to £86 million but this 
was largely due to the devaluation of the Norwegian Kroner 
(£11 million). We have a very strong business in the Nordics and 
continue to gain share in all key markets. We continue to focus 
on pricing and new product and service offerings, such as our 
‘epoq’ kitchen range and the rollout of KNOWHOW. In Sweden 
we are building a cutting edge small box distribution centre to 
support the growth of multi-channel throughout the Nordics 
and across the region we are expanding our range of private 
label products. We believe that these and many other initiatives 
will continue to drive profitable growth in the years to come. 
Like-for-like sales in Southern Europe were down 5%, but 
exited the year up 8% in Q4. EBIT grew 40% to £14 million.  
As you are aware, this has been a time of some fluidity in the 
political and economic situation in Greece. Nevertheless, 
Kotsovolos gained significant market share and exited the year 
back in profitability for the first time in 5 years. What the future 
holds in the immediate term is necessarily less certain, but with 
a really excellent team and a strong market position, we feel 
that this situation may end up proving the aphorism that all 
crisis leads to opportunity.  Meanwhile, the market in Spain 
remains tough, but our stores saw improved trading during  
the final quarter boosted by the distribution of Movistar quad 
play offerings.  
In December we announced that we plan to deliver at least our 
synergy target of £80 million by financial year 2016/17- one 
year ahead of plan. The integration continues to progress well. 
During the year we have announced our joint UK head office 
and moved into one head office in both Sweden and Ireland, 
integrated most support functions, begun consultations on 
moving our logistics and our repair centres and opened almost 
250 Carphone Warehouse SWAS. We have opened a number 
of co-branded Elgiganten Phone House stores in Sweden and 
launched the Phone House in Norway. In both cases the 
performance of these stores has been very encouraging. 
The Connected World Services management team have put in 
place a newly-configured organisational structure to deliver on 
an already strong pipeline and we now have the sales team to 
develop our pipeline. Post the year end we were very pleased 
to announce a partnership with Sprint in the US, and subject to 
the successful completion of a pilot phase, we will open up to 
500 new stores, as well as a separate agreement to provide 
services to support their existing retail business. In addition, 
following the success of honeyBee in the UK, we are also 
preparing for launch in Canada. 
Our focus on markets where we have scale and relevance led 
to the decision to exit from our retail businesses in Germany 
and the Netherlands, whilst retaining long-term contracts for 
the provision of insurance services in these markets through 
CWS. On 16 July 2015 we also announced plans to dispose  
of our operations in Portugal.  
A great deal has been achieved this year, but there is still  
much to do. Delivery options, IT investment, extending our  
free warranty programme, further training for our colleagues, 
completion of the integration, building on our MVNO and CWS 
businesses, creating a new services business and even 
stronger pricing in some territories are just some of the 
initiatives in our sights to build on our long-term sustainability 
and grow the value of the Company.    Dixons Carphone plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014/15

The consumer electronics and mobile phone landscapes  
are in a constant state of flux – and never more so than today. 
This creates challenges of course, but also some exciting 
opportunities. The growth of smartphones, tablets and the 
speed of internet access both in and out of the home, together 
with an increasing number of connected devices, are changing 
the way people live their lives, communicate, and use 
technology. This has made a number of new markets available 
to Dixons Carphone, including wellness, security, content and 
home management. We are focused on building strong 
positions in these markets in the next few years. 
On top of this, the growing complexity and interconnectivity  
of products means that customers are increasingly demanding 
help and support throughout a product’s lifecycle, from 
choosing the right product at the outset through to installation, 
connection, and repair. This provides an increasing opportunity 
for our Geek Squad and KNOWHOW services, as customers 
ask for help in getting their products working – and keeping 
them working.  
Behind our end-to-end service operation we have a 
comprehensive - and unique - infrastructure, including 
technical support, delivery, installation, repair and recycling. 
We plan to leverage this infrastructure to widen our services 
customer base right across our core markets.  
Finally, every team and every individual will have been affected 
by the many changes that the organisation has navigated this 
year. I began by listing some of the many achievements we 
have accomplished in the year, but to do all this whilst ensuring 
we did not take our eye off the ball is a testament to the 
creativity, skill, fortitude and hard work of the very talented 
men and women that make up Dixons Carphone. I would like 
to take this opportunity to offer my humble and heartfelt thanks 
to them.

Our markets 
7 
The integration of connectivity, products and services was 
central to the Merger rationale for Carphone Warehouse and 
Dixons Retail into Dixons Carphone, and we operate across  
a variety of distinct marketplaces such as mobile; consumer 
electronics; and business to business operations via the 
Connected World Services division. 
In mobile, the Group is well placed, in particular in the UK,  
to offer impartial advice on a vast array of propositions. The 
markets in which the Group operates are served by mobile 
network operators and independent and generalist retailers. 
 In the UK we have seen a major market withdrawal with the 
exit of Phones 4u. As a result our market share improved, in 
particular in the higher value post-pay segments. The Group  
is positioned to improve this further, as the only nationwide 
independent channel with multi-year contracts with all the 
major MNOs. 
Mobile telephony has evolved rapidly, from simple mobile 
devices to sophisticated hardware with advanced computing 
functionality. There is a wide choice of operating platforms and 
network options for customers, which makes the Group’s 
expert and impartial proposition particularly relevant. 
MNOs across Western Europe have been investing 
significantly in the development of their 4G network 
infrastructures. 4G technology facilitates much faster 
downloads, providing comparable levels of performance to 
many Wi-Fi networks, and providing a much better platform for 
streaming than 3G. MNOs have seen significantly increased 
levels of data usage, a trend which we see continuing as 
network quality improves, and more and more devices become 
capable of communicating with one another. MNOs will 
continue to roll out their 4G networks, with nationwide 
coverage expected in the UK by the end of 2015.  
To benefit from 4G services, customers need 4G-enabled 
devices and as 4G network coverage improves in Western 
Europe, there is an incentive for customers to upgrade their 
services, providing a stimulus to the replacement cycle as 
penetration of 4G devices and tariffs increase. After several 
years of downward pressure on ARPU, increased data usage 
provides an exciting opportunity for MNOs. 
The internet plays an important part of customers' purchasing 
journey for mobile. The majority of customers research online 
before making a purchase. Online sales continue to grow as a 
proportion of sales and represent between 5% and 20% of 
total retail sales for the Group’s markets. Customers continue 
to value the advice available within stores, on the many 
choices open to them. 
The electrical retail market can be split between specialist 
electrical retailers, such as Dixons Carphone, and general 
retailers which sell certain electrical goods as part of a wider 
offering. The market can also be broken down into two distinct 
distribution channels: ‘assisted’ and ‘unassisted’. In the 
assisted channel, specialist retailers, such as Dixons 
Carphone, help customers through the buying process in the 
form of product advice, add-on services, delivery and 
installation. The unassisted channel, which includes single 
channel internet retailers as well as general retailers, tends not 
to offer all of these services. 
Specialist electrical retailers are the predominant destination 
for customers in the European consumer electrical market. 
Buying groups, general merchants and independents also have 
a retail presence through stores and / or online. The market is 
served by a relatively small number of global manufacturers 
supplying goods to local, regional, national and international 
electrical retailers. 
We have seen some significant shifts in capacity in many of  
our markets in recent years with some mass merchandisers 
reducing space for electrical products, some single channel 
internet operators de-emphasising certain segments, as well 
as some specialists exiting the market. These shifts have 
helped us to gain market share and it underpins our view that  
a strong service led multi-channel operation satisfies both 
customer and supplier needs while delivering a sustainable 
business as customer shopping habits continue to evolve. We 
believe further consolidation will occur in some of our markets. 
The internet has established itself as a fundamental part of the 
retail landscape. It brings enhanced product information as 
well as price comparability. It is becoming an important part of 
the buying process for customers, particularly for large ticket 
discretionary products. Larger retailers, with an integrated 
multi-channel ‘bricks and clicks’ offer, with scalable distribution 
and systems, together with proven after sales service and 
support are increasingly attractive to customers. Our 
collect@store service, where customers can order on the 
internet and collect from a convenient store at a time to suit 
them, and our pay&collect service, where customers can 
access a wider range of products than is typically available in 
their local store for either home delivery or later collection from 
the store, are both proving to be increasingly popular. 
The UK and Nordic markets have high broadband penetration 
and a maturing online sales platform. The increase in online 
penetration provides us with the opportunity to increase both 
the range of goods on offer and the availability of product 
information. Our multi-channel approach is well placed to 
exploit synergies between our internet sites and stores. 
Innovation brings new products with improved functionality 
that drive sales growth. These include 4K Ultra High Definition 
and Smart TVs, wearable technology, tablets as well as 
converging products that combine the flexibility of a tablet with 
a keyboard. Content, such as social media, apps, digital media 
and cloud computing, also help to drive hardware innovation 
and replacement. Product sales are driven by structural shifts, 
such as analogue to digital and standard format through to 
Ultra HD television. In addition, innovation drives new service 
requirements, including TV installation, data backup, computer 
set up and instructional Showhow teach-ins. In this 
increasingly complex world we believe our assisted sales 
model is best placed to help customers navigate the market 
and to help them choose a complete solution that best meets 
their needs.   Dixons Carphone plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014/15 
Strategic report
Our markets 
8 
Electrical products, and in particular ‘brown goods’, are 
predominantly discretionary purchases. However, increasing 
penetration of digital technology in the home drives faster 
replacement cycles as these products become less 
discretionary. The economic backdrop also determines 
whether customers trade up or down. Accordingly, the 
electrical market tends to grow at a rate which is at or 
exceeding the economy during years of economic growth. 
While the opposite can be true during a downturn, this may  
be influenced by new innovation and products. 
The rapid innovation cycle may lead to price deflation in ‘brown 
goods’ and computing, but also drive volume as products 
become more affordable and replacement cycles accelerate. 
For larger ticket items, the low frequency of purchases limits 
the impact of price deflation on total market sales as 
consumers typically trade up to higher specification products. 
Our ‘Customer Journeys’ are designed to explain the features 
and benefits of the latest technology to customers and help 
them understand the reasons for trading up to these newer 
technologies. 
The sale of ‘white goods’ is underpinned by the replacement 
cycle. Due to higher costs of repair, it often makes better 
economic sense for consumers to replace ‘white goods’ 
outright rather than to arrange for their repair. The sale of ‘white 
goods’ is also driven by the dynamics of the housing market  
as new construction, house sales and refurbishment trigger 
new purchases.  
We are one of the largest specialist electrical retailing and 
services companies in Europe with leading market shares in 
the UK, Ireland, the Nordic region and Greece. We benefit from 
long established and widely recognised brands. In each of our 
markets there are varying numbers of specialist retailers who 
compete in the assisted market. While we do compete against 
general retailers, this is usually limited to certain lower price 
categories as these retailers do not offer the full range of 
products, assisted sale or the other services we are able  
to provide. 
Technology and the digitised world increasingly embed 
themselves into our customers’ lives through social media, 
online gaming, watching movies on the move, sharing pictures 
with others, backing up files in the cloud or controlling energy 
efficiency. The latest technology allows our customers to do  
all this and more with tablets, Smart TVs and apps. The 
ecosystems behind the current digital revolution are simplifying 
our customers’ lives. Customers come to us not just for the 
enabling technology, but to find a solution. 
Developments in mobile broadband technology will continue to 
transform lives and current industry developments suggest that 
everyday objects will increasingly be connected to the internet, 
in an ‘Internet of Things’. The 'Internet of Things' means that 
people can manage home security or heating, or domestic 
electronics through their smartphones. This phenomenon will 
not only drive mobile data growth, but also machine-to-
machine data growth. With smartphones at the heart of this 
evolution we believe that the Group is well placed. 
Selling connected devices requires a range of experience and 
processes that many retailers find impossible to emulate. It can 
be an expensive, complicated and difficult process. The Group 
combines the connectivity and product expertise of the two 
former businesses at a crucial stepping-stone in the 
development of the ‘Internet of Things’. 
Connected World Services aims to leverage the specialist 
skills, operating processes and technology of the business to 
provide services to third parties looking to develop their own 
connected world solutions. CWS already provides managed 
services to a number of businesses and is actively exploring 
further opportunities. Connected retailing has become one of 
the five areas of expertise, along with services and support, 
technology platform, product solutions and MVNO.

Strategy and business model 
10 
The Merger of Carphone and Dixons brought two market 
leading businesses together with an unrivalled offer for the  
new connected world, as mobile, electricals and connectivity 
increasingly integrate. The Group now has a unique 
independent position in the UK for mobile telephones, offering 
impartial and personal service via the pioneering tablet based 
assisted sales tool Pin Point. 
Furthermore, as evidenced by recent announcements in 
Germany, the Netherlands and Portugal, we continue to be 
relentless in managing our business portfolio, focusing on 
territories in which we are the market leader and growing 
market share. 
This enables us to drive the Group forward from a position  
of strength with a focus on four strategic priorities. By focusing 
on these we can deliver not only a better business for our 
customers and colleagues, but also better returns for 
shareholders.  
The strategic priorities are: 
1. Continue to enhance and drive successful  
and sustainable retail business models in a  
multi-channel world; 
2. Complete the integration process and achieve  
our synergy targets; 
3. Leverage our scale, our knowhow, and our unique 
asset base to drive growth in new product areas 
including growth in services; and 
4. Continue to develop the Connected World  
Services model and establish it as a material 
contributor to earnings. 
Looking at each of these in turn: 
1. Continue to enhance and drive successful  
and sustainable retail business models in a  
multi-channel world 
The way in which customers shop continues to evolve.  
Our customers tell us that they want advice, to experience 
products and services and to ensure they are making the right 
choices, particularly as these are often major purchases and, in 
the case of ‘white’ and ‘brown goods’, that the customer will 
own for several years. The internet empowers customers with 
greater access to information including product knowledge 
and price transparency. In mobile, we are uniquely positioned 
in the UK to provide independent advice, meeting customer 
requirements for impartiality, comparability and flexibility, both 
online and in-store with the Pin Point tool. In consumer 
electronics, single channel internet operators have a different 
model whose principal advantage is structurally lower costs 
and which have historically been able to offer competitive 
prices versus store based operators. By focusing on those 
aspects that we, as a multi-channel specialist, can offer 
customers and suppliers we can eliminate the cost advantage 
that pure play internet operators have historically enjoyed. As  
a result we are able to offer customers very competitive prices 
against our competitor set and still be more profitable.  
There are four distinct activities that we believe are the key 
strengths of our multi-channel, service-based model and which 
will support our competitive advantage going forward: 
i. Work closely with suppliers to harness benefits available  
to our business model: Suppliers want to ensure that 
customers not only choose their brands, but also 
experience the benefits of the latest products. As a  
multi-channel operator we work with our suppliers to 
ensure we can explain the benefits of these products and 
demonstrate them to customers in our stores and our 
suppliers support us in this work in a variety of ways. 
ii. Focus on complete solutions for customers: The Pin Point 
tool enables the personalisation of the mobile customer 
experience. Using tablets in store, we ask customers a few 
simple questions to help them find the right deal. The tool 
will identify the preferred network via its coverage checker, 
handset and operating system, check bundle options 
including data requirements and ensure this is future 
proofed. In consumer electronics, customers buy products 
in order to achieve something, such as washing clothes, or 
entertaining the children. This does not just mean buying 
the hardware, but increasingly includes delivery, 
explanation and peace of mind through product support 
and after sales services, as well as accessories and 
eventually, recycling. The conversations our colleagues 
have in store with customers gives us an opportunity to 
explain the benefits of these solutions and sell more of 
them than our single-channel competition.  
iii.  Drive our service proposition: We need to be able to stand 
shoulder to shoulder with our customers and for them to 
know they can come to our stores and get knowledgeable 
advice and great service to help them buy the right 
product. They need to be confident that we will solve their 
problem quickly and efficiently. Geek Squad and 
KNOWHOW in the UK offer customers services and 
technical support that can help them with their product 
throughout its lifetime.  
iv. Reduce costs: The scale of our operations across stores, 
ranges, logistics, distribution, repairs and services means 
that we can continually improve processes to reduce 
costs. We have removed a considerable amount of cost 
from the business over the last few years by making the 
business simpler, easier to operate and more efficient and 
we remain relentlessly focused on managing costs to make 
our business more efficient.    Dixons Carphone plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014/15

2. Complete the integration process and achieve  
our synergy targets 
At our interim results we were pleased to announce that our 
synergies plan was firmly on track. We confirmed the total 
figure of £80 million and that this would be achieved a year 
earlier than anticipated in 2016/17. 
We are acutely aware that the bulk of the synergies are to be 
realised over the course of the coming two years. Whilst we 
have made fantastic progress, including our head office 
integrations in the Group / UK, Ireland and Sweden as well as 
the rollout of the SWAS programme we continue to implement 
our plans to achieve our synergy targets. 
3. Leverage our scale, our knowhow, and our unique 
infrastructure to drive growth in new product areas 
including growth in services 
The Merger allows us to expand and strengthen our 
proposition to customers, our service capability and our 
relationship with suppliers to underpin and drive even greater 
advantage in the markets in which we operate. 
The Group has many best practices in each of its business 
divisions and we are sharing them across the Group, such as 
the co-branded Elgiganten / Phone House stores in Sweden, 
new store formats, use of Pin Point, supplier relationships and, 
to a limited degree, own brands.  
Growing complexity and interconnectivity of products means 
that customers are increasingly demanding help and support, 
not just in choosing the right product, but also installation, 
connection, support and repair. Our Geek Squad and 
KNOWHOW services are at the forefront of this in the UK and 
we have started to roll out our KNOWHOW services across the 
Nordics.  
We must continue to innovate new services to help customers 
and to remain relevant to the way products and connectivity is 
evolving. Behind our end-to-end service operation we have a 
comprehensive infrastructure, including technical phone 
support, delivery, installation, repair and recycling. We can 
leverage this infrastructure to widen our customer base either 
to customers who bought their products through a third party 
(for example, our fault&fix computer service), or for business 
customers. By doing this we can increase the efficiency of 
using this infrastructure and deliver even better value services 
to our customers.  
4. Continue to develop the Connected World  
Services model and establish it as a material 
contributor to earnings 
We can leverage the specialist skills, operating processes, 
technology and infrastructure of the enhanced group to 
provide services to third parties to support their connected 
world solutions. 
The consumer electronics and mobile phone retail landscapes 
have evolved significantly over the last few years. In particular, 
the growth of smartphones, tablets and the speed of internet 
access both in and out of the home, together with an 
increasing number of connected devices, are altering the way 
people live their lives, communicate and use technology. This 
applies to a number of market segments, including health, 
security, content and home management. Linked to this 
market development will be a need for a raft of new services 
that will ensure that these technologies work.

Strategy and business model

Business model 
Our business model, driven by customer insight, comprises 
three pillars underpinned by a low cost operating model.  
In order to ensure we understand what products and services 
our customers want, how they use the products they buy from 
us and what they think of the service they get from us, we use 
extensive customer insight. This includes discussions at 
customer panels, interviews, home visits and detailed surveys. 
We use this information to build our ranges, improve our stores 
and services and for other business decisions. This is 
supported by mystery shoppers, exit surveys and customer 
feedback. During the year our UK and Nordics businesses 
made considerable progress in customer satisfaction metrics 
as we continue to improve the business. 
Taking each of the three pillars in turn, our model can be 
described as follows: 
Multi-channel 
The shopping trip for customers is constantly evolving.  
Our objective is to provide our customers with a seamless  
and personalised experience where convenience, ease of 
navigation and simplicity are key in attracting customers to 
shop with us whether it is online, in-store or a combination  
of both.  
We constantly aim to develop and improve our customer 
journey whether via our assisted sales tool Pin Point or by 
improving stores, making them easier to shop in, with for 
example, improved navigation, better signage, enabling 
customers to interact with products before they buy, as well  
as good advice on features and benefits from our colleagues. 
Our websites are an integral part of the customer shopping 
journey. In recognition of how customer trends are evolving we 
have made it easier for our colleagues, in particular within our  
CurrysPCWorld stores, to access products and extended 
ranges in store. 
Our training programmes combined with our product learning 
centres and customer journeys provide our colleagues with the 
right tools to understand customers’ needs and to provide 
them with the complete solution to properly meet those needs. 
We will continue to improve the training of our colleagues and 
the ways in which we can make them experts in the products 
we sell. For example they have recently undertaken a new 
training programme focusing on selling multi-play. 
Products 
Combining our customer insight with our market strength we 
can make sure we have the right range of products and 
services in our stores to suit customers’ needs. Our scale and 
relationships with suppliers means that we can work with them 
to showcase the latest technology, connectivity and products 
in our stores with areas dedicated to key suppliers. 
In consumer electronics, own-brand products enable us to 
offer customers greater choice and access to a range of 
products at competitive prices. We have defined a clear  
‘good, better, best’ brand range including: Currys and PC 
World Essentials; Logik; iWantit; Advent; Goji; and Sandstrøm 
brands. We see particular opportunities in the area of 
accessories and essentials with, for example, our own range  
of Sandstrøm cables. 
After sales services and support 
Our customers need help with their products, whether it be 
delivery and installation, help keeping their products up and 
running or repair should things go wrong. Our business in the 
UK & Ireland sets the benchmark for our services infrastructure 
under our Geek Squad and KNOWHOW brands, the latter of 
which is also available across the Nordics. 
We operate the largest network of two-man deliveries in the 
UK with an average of 50,000 deliveries per week enabling us 
to provide customers with the convenience of next day delivery 
in a four hour time slot or the option of a free delivery at a later 
date. We repair more than 1 million handsets per year and 
provide over 11 million insurance or service agreements, carry 
out approximately 500,000 computing set-ups per year and 
take 125,000 technical support calls each week. 
Our Geek Squad and KNOWHOW teams in stores, in our call 
centres as well as field technicians, can provide set-up and 
upgrade services and online fix and back up services. Our 
market leading range of help and support services ensure a 
customer has the backing of expertise and support that keeps 
their technology up and running. Our state of the art repair 
facility in Newark is able to repair and return a laptop in seven 
days. Our network of field technicians offer ‘white goods’  
repair in a market we estimate to be worth around £500 million 
a year.  
Through ownership of the service infrastructure we can ensure 
the quality of service delivered to customers. This, we believe, 
provides us with a significant competitive advantage in 
meeting the needs of our customers, as well as a revenue 
stream not readily available to single channel online and mass 
market competitors.

Customers 
We are driven to provide unparalleled expertise and services to 
help customers and businesses navigate the new digital era 
and one of our key values is: we put the customer first, always.  
To deliver on this value and to ensure we continue to respond 
to customers’ needs, we must listen and respond effectively  
to them. We have comprehensive customer research 
programmes spanning a variety of tools including exit surveys, 
mystery shoppers and focus groups as well as effective data 
gathering through, for example, our ‘Happy or Not’ tools 
launched in our Elkjøp business and now introduced to 
CurrysPCWorld. Within our Carphone Warehouse stores,  
our Each and Every Customer Counts programme and Net 
Promoter Scores (NPS) are integral to our internal reward 
system. We are pleased that customer satisfaction scores 
across the business are at record levels. 
Through this research, managed internally and reviewed daily, 
weekly and monthly, we have developed a clear and detailed 
understanding of what we are doing well and more importantly 
of where we can target further improvements. Customers tell 
us that they need us to deliver a strong combination of ‘Value, 
Choice and Service’ across all our shopping channels and it is 
clear from their feedback that more and more, they recognise 
that we are doing this. We will continue to deliver easier, more 
exciting places to shop for customers whether that be in store, 
online or a multi-channel combination of both.  
Listening to customers extends into how we approach the 
sales process in store. Our unique training programmes 
combined with our customer journeys, including Pin Point,  
are designed to ensure customers leave our stores with a 
complete solution that is right for them. Doing this is a key  
part of our ongoing strategy and delivery of a sustainable 
business model, as well as enabling us to differentiate our  
offer from competitors. 
By maintaining our absolute focus on the customer and 
delivering what they want in a retail environment that is 
constantly evolving, we will continue to attract new  
customers and retain existing ones. 
People 
Dixons Carphone is an organisation spanning Europe, with 
over 40,000 colleagues in over 2,300 stores, offices, call 
centres and distribution centres and one of our key priorities 
following the Merger has been to build one culture, one vision 
and one future. 
To support this we have launched our company values: 
• We put the customer first, always 
• We stand together as one 
• We act bravely, challenge convention and do the right thing 
• We know everyone can make a difference 
• We believe anything is possible 
This supports a ‘culture of discovery’ and faces head on the 
changing environment in which we operate and supports us in 
cultivating a high performance environment where each 
employee performs to the best of their ability, working together 
to achieve to their fullest potential. Our people are key to our 
success and it is essential that colleagues are innovative and 
creative, customer-focused and great at building relationships.  
We are focused on improving every possible aspect of the 
shopping journey, we want our colleagues to become famous 
for service and retain customers for life by having exciting  
new stores, the best range at great prices and untangling  
the shopping trip. We are making good progress, however,  
we must never be satisfied and we can and must make  
further improvements to delight customers and to outpace  
the competition. 
We are focusing on building a career development framework 
that rewards customer centric behaviour and instils a sense of 
pride in our colleagues. We now provide tailor-made 
development programmes and support further education 
qualifications for our colleagues throughout the business.  
Our development programmes use modules, training 
workshops and a dedicated e-learning intranet service that 
helps provide the skills colleagues need to succeed at every 
level and career stage. We are also launching a dedicated 
training academy later in the year. 
We use our sophisticated tracking and measuring processes, 
including regular mystery shops and exit surveys, to measure 
individual and store performance, and to ensure we reward 
appropriate behaviours. We also use a balanced scorecard 
approach, based on the belief that engaged teams deliver 
great service, which, in turn, delivers results for the business. 
We measure the people element of our scorecard using a 
colleague engagement survey, which runs twice a year. 
During the year we launched the first Dixons Carphone 
Sharesave scheme giving employees the chance to own  
a part of the Company and share in its success. 
Suppliers 
With our market-leading positions, growing reputation and 
being increasingly seen as the ‘go to’ location for all the latest 
technology, our relationship with suppliers becomes ever more 
important as well as ever stronger. Product sourcing offices 
continually monitor current and future product cycles with 
existing and potential suppliers. 
In a complex multi-channel environment, suppliers trust us  
with their new product releases and stock allocations, as they 
appreciate the superior service and advice offered by our 
stores and indeed our websites, as well as the exciting   Dixons Carphone plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014/15 
Strategic report
Our resources 
14 
environments offered by our transformed stores in which 
customers can experience their brands and products. 
We work closely with suppliers of all sizes to help them deliver 
the right product for customers, through the forecasting and 
planning stages to ensure we deliver the right levels of stock 
for customers at the right time. Both the mobile and electrical 
industries are characterised by a number of large global 
manufacturers, who account for a large proportion of our sales. 
However, we also source products from a large number of 
smaller suppliers. We seek to maintain strong relationships 
with all of these suppliers, not just to source the right product 
for customers, but also to ensure the Group can purchase  
the appropriate level of stock on favourable terms. While we 
utilise the Group’s scale and buying power through an 
international buying team, we also maintain strong 
relationships at a local level. 
We continue to refine our own-brand ranges to suit all budgets 
and tastes. Our most notable successes have been the launch 
of our own Sandstrøm cables brand alongside our Essentials 
ranges as key entry level products in our ‘good, better, best’ 
line-up. These products are sourced by the Group’s teams 
based in the UK and Hong Kong in collaboration with 
manufacturers in, for example, Asia. 
Distribution and logistics 
The Group sees distribution as one of the keys to success in 
maintaining highly competitive margins and delivering 
outstanding, market beating service to customers. We operate 
a centralised system of distribution centres for each of the 
regions in which we operate. This delivers significant 
competitive advantages, including reduced operating costs, 
reduced supplier delivery costs, reduced stock volumes in 
store, increased flexibility as to where to deliver and when,  
and a more efficient home delivery network for both us and  
our customers. 
While continuing to reduce costs, we are also constantly 
raising the bar, both in terms of successful delivery and 
installation rates, but also the range and quality of services  
we offer customers nationwide. In our Nordic operations 
(Jönköping, Sweden) and the UK (Newark), we operate two of 
the largest distribution centres of their kind in Europe. In the 
UK alone we now make 50,000 deliveries per week, including 
some 500,000 installations per year. 
Store portfolio 
We operate a wide variety of stores to suit the local customer 
demographics. We operate many high street locations, small, 
very popular outlets in airport locations and ‘megastores’ up to 
60,000 sq ft, in out-of-town locations. 
We constantly review our store portfolio to ensure we have  
the right store for customers in the most competitive locations. 
As part of this ongoing review and following the rollout of 
Carphone Warehouse SWAS, in the UK & Ireland we are 
currently trialling 3-in-1 stores to help determine the end state 
property portfolio. Separately we also continue to transition 
Currys and PC World stores to a 2-in-1 format in the UK & 
Ireland. These stores allow us to offer the best of both worlds 
to customers, attracting new footfall and often at a lower cost. 
In the Nordic region as well as Greece and Spain we also 
operate a number of franchise stores. This arrangement allows 
our brands to be present in a wider range of catchments, while 
increasing the volume of purchases and therefore buying 
power of the Group.  
Intellectual property 
Within our Connected World Services division we have 
developed our pioneering multi-channel assisted sales tool  
Pin Point powered by honeyBee. We are also utilising our 
intellectual property to assist third parties, such as Samsung 
and now Sprint, in connected retailing. 
In the UK & Ireland we operate through Carphone Warehouse, 
Currys and PC World brands, in the Nordics through its 
various Elkjøp and Phone House brands and in Greece 
through Kotsovolos and in Spain through Phone House. 
These brands are extremely well-established and respected  
in their markets. The Group also has two strong service 
businesses, KNOWHOW and Geek Squad, aiming to delight 
customers from end to end while generating significant new 
business opportunities. 
As well as our retail and service brands outlined above, we also 
sell a range of own brand products such as Sandstrøm, Goji, 
Logik, Essentials and Advent. Each of these brands have 
specific target markets defined in conjunction with our 
customer research findings.  
Energy 
Saving energy is good for the business, good for customers 
and of course good for the environment. We take energy 
efficiency extremely seriously and whilst we have already made 
progress in a number of areas, we are investing in a wider 
range of initiatives to significantly reduce our consumption 
going forward. These include Variable Speed drives to optimise 
the efficiency of in-store heating, ventilation and air 
conditioning systems and new efficient fluorescent lighting in  
a number of stores. Efficient LED lighting has been trialled in 
back of house areas which we intend to roll out to further 
stores and the 65,000 sq ft Customer Call Centre in Sheffield 
has been upgraded to LED lighting throughout. 
Cash and capital 
It remains the Group’s policy to maintain a strong capital base 
so as to maintain investor, creditor and market confidence and 
to sustain the future development of the business. Through 
careful working capital and balance sheet management, a 
focus on cost reduction as well as efficient use of capital, 
management is focused on ensuring we deliver a sustainable 
business with strong cash generation. 
As a Group we need to make the right choices as to how each 
division utilises or preserves cash, whether it be in determining 
ranges and stock held in store, growing mobile share with 
accompanying working capital utilisation or managing returns 
and related processes.    Dixons Carphone plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014/15

Principal risks to achieving the Group’s objectives 
16 
The Group recognises that taking risks is an inherent part of doing business and that competitive advantage can be gained 
through effectively managing risk. The Group continues to develop robust risk management processes, integrating risk 
management into business decision making. Risks have evolved for the Group as a result of the Merger. A comprehensive post 
Merger risk assessment has been undertaken resulting in a revised set of principal risks. The principal risks and uncertainties, 
together with their potential impacts, are set out in the tables below along with an illustration of what is being done to mitigate 
them. The Group’s overall risk environment is relatively unchanged since last year, notwithstanding changes to specific risks.  
Specific risks and potential impacts 
Principal risk Specific risks Potential impacts 
1. Dependence on 
networks and key 
suppliers 
• The Group is dependent on relationships with key suppliers  
to source products on which availability may be limited  
• Changes in Mobile Network Operator (MNO) strategies in  
relation to the Group, or more generally, and / or their performance, 
could materially affect the revenues and profits of the business 
 
• Reduced revenue and profitability 
• Deteriorating cash flow 
• Reduced market share 
 
2. Consumer environment 
and sustainable  
business model 
• Failure to respond with a business model that enables the  
business to compete against a broad range of competitors on  
service, price and / or range in a changing economy 
• Failure to respond effectively to changes in the industry,  
economic and / or competitor landscape 
• Failure to accommodate changes in consumer preferences  
and behaviours 
• Some markets may not have the scale required to compete  
effectively against increased competition, although we are  
exiting from some of these 
 
 
 
 
 
• Reduced revenue and profitability 
• Deteriorating cash flow 
• Reduced market share 
• Loss of competitive advantage 
 
3. Greek Exit from  
the Euro 
• Possible exit of Greece from the Euro could lead to a deterioration

Basis of preparation – pro forma information 
On 26 June 2013 the Carphone Warehouse Group plc acquired the 50% of CPW Europe which it did not already own from Best Buy Co. Inc., 
and on 6 August 2014 an all share merger of Carphone Warehouse and Dixons Retail plc (the Merger) took place. The information in the 
highlights and performance review sections refer, unless otherwise stated, to pro forma Headline
(1)
 information for continuing businesses, 
reflecting the results of both Carphone Warehouse and Dixons Retail throughout both the current and comparative periods as if the CPW  
Europe Acquisition and the Merger had occurred at the start of the comparative period. 
 
The Group has changed its year end to be the Saturday closest to 30 April. The current year end therefore comprises the 13 months to 2 May 
2015 for the Carphone Warehouse business with a comparative period of the 12 months ended 29 March 2014 in line with previously reported 
results. As such the current year includes an additional five weeks of results from the Carphone Warehouse business. The prior period results  
of Carphone Warehouse have been restated to exclude the results of its retail operations in France, Germany, the Netherlands and Portugal 
which are treated as discontinued operations following the decision to exit these businesses.  
 
Prior year comparatives for Carphone Warehouse have also been restated to reclassify the unwind of discounts for the time value of money  
on network commissions receivable from pro forma Headline EBIT to interest, in line with the treatment in the current period and with the 
classification in the statutory results. This item had a value of £9 million for the prior year and the reclassification has the impact of reducing  
pro forma Headline EBIT. 
 
Current period pro forma results for the Dixons Retail business comprise the 12 months ended 2 May 2015 with a comparative period of the  
12 months ended 30 April 2014. 
 
Notes 
(1) Headline results exclude amortisation of acquisition intangibles, merger integration and transaction costs, CPW Europe Acquisition related 
items, Phone House France operating and closure costs whilst it formed part of the CPW Europe joint venture, net interest on defined 
benefit pension schemes and discontinued operations (comprising Virgin Mobile France and Phone House operations in France,  
Germany, the Netherlands and Portugal). Such excluded items are described as ‘Non-Headline’. For further details see notes 4 and  
24 to the Group financial statements. 
(2) Pro forma EPS has been calculated assuming the number of shares existing at 2 May 2015, adjusted for the number of shares held by the 
Group ESOT, apply from the start of the current and comparative periods. 
(3) Like-for-like sales are calculated based on Headline store and internet sales using constant exchange rates. New stores are included where 
they have been open for a full financial year both at the beginning and end of the financial period. Sales from franchise stores are excluded 
and closed stores are excluded for any period of closure during either period. Customer support agreement, insurance and wholesale 
revenues along with revenue from Connected World Services and other non-retail businesses are excluded from like-for-like calculations. 
Revenue from Carphone Warehouse SWAS are included in like-for-like. Like-for-like revenue reflects performance for the Carphone 
Warehouse business for the 13 months to 2 May 2015 compared to the 13 months to 3 May 2014 and for the Dixons Retail business for  
the 12 months ended 2 May 2015 compared to the 12 months ended 30 April 2014. 
(4) UK & Ireland comprises operations in the UK and Ireland and the Dixons Travel business. 
(5) Nordics comprises operations in Norway, Sweden, Finland, Denmark, and Iceland. Prior to the announced disposals of operations in 
Germany and the Netherlands which previously formed part of this segment, it was named Northern Europe. 
(6) Southern Europe comprises operations in Spain and Greece. This now excludes the results of Portugal which are presented as  
discontinued operations. 
(7) Connected World Services comprises the Group’s B2B operation which leverages the specialist skills, operating processes and technology 
of the Group to provide managed services to third parties looking to develop their own connected world solutions. 
(8) Pro forma net debt reflects the consolidated net debt of the Group at 2 May 2015 including net funds recognised within assets held for sale 
of £53 million.  Dixons Carphone plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014/15

Performance review 
22 
Group 
Group pro forma Headline revenue was up 2% to  
£9,936 million (2013/14: £9,752 million) and up 6% on a  
local currency basis, with both including a 2% benefit due to 
an extra five weeks of trading from the Carphone Warehouse 
business. Like-for-like revenue growth was 6% reflecting 
growth in our UK & Ireland, Nordic and Greek businesses, 
partially offset by performance in the Spanish market. The 
difference between the total revenue growth on a local 
currency basis (adjusted for the additional weeks from the 
Carphone Warehouse business) and like-for-like is 
predominantly due to a reduction in stores. 
Despite operating in a highly competitive market place, the 
Group has continued to grow market share and maintain stable 
gross margin across the year. 
Pro forma Headline EBIT was up 15% to £414 million (2013/14: 
£359 million) driven by the strong operating performance in  
the UK & Ireland. Pro forma Headline profit before tax was 
£381 million (2013/14: £316 million) reflecting the improved 
EBIT and a lower interest charge year-on-year following the 
redemption of the bonds previously held by Dixons Retail in 
August 2014. 
As a part of the Merger we carried out a thorough analysis of 
the opportunities that combining the two businesses could 
bring and, as previously communicated, our stated target of a 
minimum £80 million of synergies by 2017/18 has now been 
brought forward by one year to 2016/17. Integration of the two 
businesses continues to progress well with 244 new Carphone 
Warehouse SWAS now open and our head office teams 
combined and operating as one. We are also rationalising 
down to one single head office location in each of the UK, 
Ireland and Sweden and we have announced the integration  
of our UK logistics and repair centres to the legacy Dixons 
Retail site in Newark.  
UK & Ireland 
The UK & Ireland had a very strong year with pro forma 
revenue up by 7% to £6,451 million (2013/14: £6,011 million) 
including a 2% benefit of the additional five weeks of trading 
from the Carphone Warehouse business. Like-for-like revenue 
for the year was up 8% reflecting strong performances in both 
electricals and mobile and the roll-out of the Carphone 
Warehouse SWAS which have delivered strong revenue 
growth on existing floor space, contributing 1% of the like-for-
like increase. The difference between the total revenue growth 
(as adjusted for the additional five weeks of trading from the 
Carphone Warehouse business) and like-for-like predominantly 
reflects a reduction in stores. 
Pro forma Headline EBIT up 26% versus last year, to  
£306 million. The business continued to gain market share  
with strong sales driving increased profitability. 
The electricals business had a very positive year supported by 
record advocacy and customer net promoter scores and our 
pricing being at its most competitive ever. The peak period, 
which now stretches six weeks from ‘Black Friday’ into the 
new year, was particularly strong with both small and large 
white goods, as well as large screen TVs, selling very well.  
Our mobile business in the UK & Ireland also performed well. 
Postpay volumes and market share continued to grow year-
on-year, driven by the exit of Phones 4u and some very 
successful product launches. During the year all the major 
networks have moved the majority of their customers onto  
4G tariffs. These factors have helped drive a better customer 
experience and have led to higher data usage. 
In May 2015, the Group launched iD, a new mobile network 
focused on providing users with increased contract flexibility, 
greater access to free data roaming and competitively priced 
4G tariffs. The initial performance of iD and the customer 
response, so far, has been very promising indeed.  
Nordics 
Nordics revenue, expressed in Sterling was affected by a 
significant movement on foreign exchange rates in the region. 
As a result pro forma Headline revenue in the Nordics was 
down 6% to £2,718 million (2013/14: £2,895 million). Pro forma 
Headline revenue on a local currency basis was up 4%. 
Nordics pro forma Headline EBIT was £86 million (2013/14: 
£102 million) reflecting a negative impact of foreign exchange 
of £11 million and the investments noted below.  
The Nordics business has had a sound year, continuing to 
consolidate and grow its position as market leader in all of the 
countries in which it operates. The business has invested in 
various areas during the year to strengthen its market position 
further and drive customer satisfaction which is at an all-time 
high in each of its countries. 
The team has launched co-branded Elgiganten Phone House 
stores with very positive results. In addition the ‘Epoq’ kitchen 
business has provided very encouraging results with strong 
revenue growth, driving market share and appliance sales.  
We expect that this operation will also provide opportunities  
in smart home and integrated products. 
The Phone House operations in Sweden encountered tough 
trading conditions during the year, but its integration with the 
Elgiganten business has been swift, driving synergy savings 
and we expect both the businesses to benefit greatly from  
the Merger.  Dixons Carphone plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014/15
Strategic report
 
 
23 
Southern Europe 
Revenue expressed in Sterling was affected by a significant 
movement on foreign exchange rates in the region. Pro forma 
revenue on a local currency basis was down 10% including  
a 3% benefit of the additional five weeks of trading from the 
Phone House Spain business. The difference between the  
local currency revenue growth and like-for-like predominantly 
reflects the closure of stores in Spain explained below. 
Southern Europe pro forma Headline EBIT was £14 million 
(2013/14: £10 million).  
The business in Greece delivered strong like-for-like revenue 
growth during the year, with most categories performing well, 
in particular large screen TVs. The strong performance in this 
market saw the business return to profitability during the year. 
We do however remain very mindful of the uncertain economic 
and political situation in the country and the effect this may 
have on our business. The team have been very active in 
planning for every contingency. 
Our business in Spain continues to operate in a tough 
marketplace. Although it has been negatively impacted by 
these pressures, we have a strong management team in place, 
which continues to innovate and develop the business. During 
the year we reached agreement with Telefonica to distribute 
the products and services of Movistar in our stores which has 
been a positive force. We have also focused the business 
model to a greater extent on franchise operations and reduced 
our own store portfolio. In total we closed a net 35 stores 
during the year reflecting an increase of 20 franchise stores 
and a reduction in own stores of 55. These activities resulted  
in restructuring costs and the disposal of some non-core 
assets all of which have been included within pro forma 
Headline results.
Connected World Services  
Connected World Services (CWS) pro forma Headline revenue 
was £130 million (2013/14: £78 million) with the increase 
predominantly reflecting the revenue from our Samsung 
Experience Stores which launched at the end of last year, in 
addition to the benefit of the additional five weeks of trading 
from the legacy Carphone Warehouse business. Pro forma 
Headline EBIT was £8 million (2013/14: £5 million). 
The CWS management team has worked hard during the year 
to grow its strong pipeline and to build on relationships with 
blue-chip partners including Samsung, Aviva, RBS and 
TalkTalk. It has also continued to develop its omni-channel 
platform, honeyBee. 
On 2 July 2015, CWS announced that it had entered into an 
agreement with Sprint Corporation, a leading US mobile 
network operator, to open and manage Sprint-branded stores 
in the US. CWS will supply retail expertise to Sprint who will 
initially open around 20 retail stores, and if this trial is 
successful, the parties will progress to a second phase which 
will involve CWS investing equally with Sprint in a joint venture 
to support roll-out plans of up to 500 stores in the US. During 
the second phase, Dixons Carphone has agreed to invest up to 
$32 million to obtain a 50% interest in the new venture. Dixons 
Carphone will also provide support across the whole of the 
Sprint estate as part of a wider know-how sharing 
arrangement. We believe this is a very exciting opportunity  
for the future and provides a platform for the Group to return  
to the US marketplace.  Dixons Carphone plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014/15

Net finance costs 
Pro forma Headline net finance costs were £33 million 
(2013/14: £43 million). The reduction in financing costs was 
primarily due to the redemption of the bonds previously held 
by Dixons Retail on 21 August 2014. 
Tax 
The Headline pro forma rate of tax for the full year is 23% 
(2013/14: 25%). This rate is higher than the UK statutory rate of 
21% predominantly reflecting higher statutory rates in the 
Nordics and certain non-deductible costs primarily in the UK. 
Statutory results 
The explanation of the Group’s results presented above is on a 
pro forma basis as if the group structure following the CPW 
Europe Acquisition and the Merger had been in place 
throughout the current and comparative periods. Group results 
as reported in the financial information are prepared on a 
statutory basis, consolidating the results of CPW Europe from 
26 June 2013 and Dixons Retail from 6 August 2014. These 
results are summarised below:

(1) Results for 2013/14 have been restated to reclassify the results  
of the operations in Germany, the Netherlands and Portugal as 
discontinued operations. 
 
Headline profit before tax increased from £128 million to  
£376 million predominantly reflecting the inclusion of a full 
period of earnings from CPW Europe and the inclusion of 
Dixons Retail results from 6 August 2014. The tax charge 
increased from £25 million to £91 million reflecting the higher 
pre-tax earnings described above. 
This in turn resulted in an increase in basic Headline EPS from 
18.6p to 29.7p for the period. This EPS reflects the growth in 
profit after tax explained above but also the fact that the 
number of shares in issue approximately doubled following  
the Merger. 
Non-Headline items 
Headline profit before tax is reported before Non-Headline 
charges of £89 million (2013/14: £51 million). These charges 
are analysed below and are reported on a statutory basis with

of the Merger on 6 August 2014.

Costs incurred in relation to the Merger include transaction 
costs of £9 million, predominantly reflecting banking and 
professional fees, and merger integration costs of £32 million 
primarily being professional fees, employee severance and 
property costs associated with the integration process. Further 
integration costs will be incurred during 2015/16 as the 
integration of the two businesses continues. 
The charge for the amortisation of acquisition intangibles was 
£35 million (2013/14: £13 million) with the current period 
including a full 13 months of amortisation of intangible assets 
recognised following the CPW Europe Acquisition and, since  
6 August 2014, the amortisation of intangible assets 
recognised as a result of the Merger. 
Net pension interest was £13 million reflecting the charge 
incurred in relation to the Dixons Retail UK pension scheme 
following completion of the Merger. 
Non-Headline items included within Dixons Retail total  
results in the period prior to the Merger comprised £11 million 
in respect of the acceleration of share-based payment  
charges which vested on the Merger, £12 million of merger 
related professional fees and £5 million of merger integration 
planning costs committed to prior to completion of the Merger, 
£42 million of debt restructuring costs in respect of early 
repayment of the bonds previously held by Dixons Retail,  
£5 million of provision releases relating to discontinued 
operations and £4 million of pension interest costs. As these 
items were incurred prior to the Merger they do not form part 
of the Group’s consolidated results.   Dixons Carphone plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014/15

Discontinued operations 
On 16 May 2014 the Group announced that it had entered into 
an agreement to sell its interest in Virgin Mobile France and 
completed the disposal on 4 December 2014 for gross 
consideration of £104 million and generated a profit of  
£87 million. 
Following the Merger, the Group put in place a strategy of 
focusing on market leadership positions, while engaging in 
other markets through partnerships with its Connected World 
Services division. The Group carried out detailed strategic 
assessments of its Phone House operations, which led to the 
decision to exit certain markets. 
• On 15 April 2015, the Group announced that it had agreed to 
the sale of its operations in Germany to Drillisch AG, a 
leading mobile virtual network operator in Germany. The sale 
completed on 5 May 2015. 
• On 24 April 2015, the Group entered into an agreement to 
dispose of a majority stake (83%) in its operations in the 
Netherlands to Relevant Holdings BV, a company set up by 
the shareholders of Optie1 which has extensive telecom 
retailing experience in the Dutch market. The sale completed 
on 30 June 2015. 
• On 16 July 2015, the Group announced its commitment to 
dispose of its operations in Portugal following the 
completion of a strategic review during 2014/15. 
Discussions, which commenced with potential acquirers 
during 2014/15, are advanced and an announcement 
confirming details of the disposal is expected in due course.  
The closure of the Phone House operations in France, which 
was announced in 2013/14, was completed during the year 
ended 2 May 2015 and is therefore now treated as a 
discontinued operation. 
Prior to the Merger, Dixons Retail agreed to sell its  
operations in the Czech Republic and Slovakia (Central 
Europe). The net assets held for sale associated with this 
business were included within the fair value of assets and 
liabilities acquired through the Merger and the sale completed 
on 11 August 2014. 
The above businesses have been treated as discontinued

Cash and movement on net funds 
The information provided below is on a pro forma basis and 
aggregates the net funds / (debt) and cash flows of the Group, 
Dixons Retail and CPW Europe, as though Dixons Retail and 
CPW Europe had been 100% owned by the Group throughout 
the current and prior periods, to enable a complete

Pro forma Free Cash Flow before restructuring was an outflow

experienced a working capital outflow of £366 million (2013/14: 
inflow of £5 million) on a pro forma basis with the year-on-year 
increase largely reflecting timing issues associated with the 
change of year end and the day on which month end fell, as 
well as the unwind of certain supplier funding arrangements 
previously in place. 
Capital expenditure in the period was £186 million on a pro 
forma basis (2013/14: £142 million), with the year-on-year 
increase reflecting significant capital expenditure on honeyBee 
and investment in relation to merging the two businesses. 
Restructuring costs in 2014/15 relate to Merger integration 
costs and primarily reflect professional fees and employee 
severance costs.

Performance review 
26 
At 2 May 2015 the Group had pro forma net debt of  
£260 million compared to prior period pro forma closing net 
funds of £63 million. Pro forma net debt at the end of April 
2014 for both businesses was £181 million.  
Free cash flow was an outflow of £112 million (2013/14: inflow 
of £280 million) for the reasons described above. 
Merger transaction costs reflect professional and banking fees, 
the cash cost of share option exercises as a result of the 
Merger and the cost of redeeming the bonds previously held 
by Dixons Retail. 
Net cash outflows from acquisitions and disposals in the 
current year were £41 million reflecting the first payment of 
deferred consideration for the CPW Europe Acquisition and 
cash outflows in discontinued operations. Cash flows in the 
prior period were £441 million predominantly reflecting cash 
flows associated with the CPW Europe Acquisition, as well as 
those associated with discontinued operations.  
The Group has a total of £875 million of committed borrowing 
facilities comprising: i) a £625 million multi-currency term and 
revolving credit facility; and ii) a £250 million revolving credit 
facility, both of which mature in April 2017. The £625 million 
facility is split into two tranches: a £400 million revolving 
tranche and a term loan tranche of £225 million. The term loan 
was amortised by £25 million during the period and is due to 
reduce by a further £50 million on 30 June 2016. These 
facilities mature in 2017 and we expect to complete refinancing 
of our facilities during 2015/16. 
Goodwill 
The goodwill of £2,629 million arising from the Merger reflects 
the fact that the value of Dixons Retail is based on its cash 
generating potential rather than its existing assets and the fact 
that many of its key strengths, such as its scale and expertise, 
do not represent intangible assets as defined by IFRS. 
Pensions 
The IAS 19 accounting deficit of the defined benefit section  
of the UK pension scheme of Dixons Retail amounted to  
£486 million at 2 May 2015 compared to £429 million at the 
date of the Merger on 6 August 2014. The assumptions  
used for determining the accounting valuation use a consistent 
basis to that adopted within the financial statements of Dixons 
Retail for the year ended 30 April 2014 and which build from 
the most recent actuarial valuation as at 31 March 2013, which 
was completed during the period being reported. Contributions 
during the period under the terms of the deficit reduction  
plan amounted to £28 million on a pro forma basis  
(2013/14: £20 million).  
The deficit has increased largely as a result of the changes in 
financial assumptions which determine liabilities, partially offset 
by an increase in the asset values.  
Dividends 
The Board declared an interim dividend of 2.5p per share, up 
from 2.0p per share last year. The interim dividend was paid  
on 23 January 2015. 
We are proposing a final dividend of 6.0p per share, taking the 
total dividend for the year to 8.5p per share, a 42% increase on 
the previous year (2013/14: 6.0p). The final dividend is subject 
to shareholder approval at the Company’s forthcoming Annual 
General Meeting. The ex-dividend date is 27 August 2015,  
with a record date of 28 August 2015 and an intended final 
dividend payment date of 25 September 2015. 
Going concern 
A review of the Group’s business activities, together with the 
factors likely to affect its future development, including 
consideration of the continuing uncertainty in Greece, 
performance and position, are set out within this Strategic 
report, including the risk management section. The financial 
position of the Group, its cash flows, liquidity position and 
borrowing facilities are shown in the balance sheet, cash  
flow statement and accompanying notes to the Group  
financial statements. 
The directors have reviewed the future cash and profit 
forecasts of the Group, which they consider to be based on 
prudent assumptions. Based on these forecasts, the directors 
consider that it is appropriate to prepare the Group financial 
statements on the going concern basis.

Corporate responsibility

Dixons Carphone is committed to high standards of 
corporate and social responsibility across the Group. 
We recognise good sustainability practices make sound 
business sense, helping us to achieve our corporate 
objectives, fulfil our business plan and minimise costs. 
For Dixons Carphone, sustainability is about strengthening our 
business by way of meaningful engagement with stakeholders, 
reducing our impact on the environment and benefiting the 
communities in which we operate. As we grow we will continue 
to listen to, and learn from our stakeholders and strive to 
reward them with consistently transparent and positive 
outcomes and experiences. 
What we care about 
Our priorities are to: 
• Provide a safe and healthy environment for employees, 
customers and visitors to our sites;  
• Engage colleagues through rewarding workplace 
environments and careers; 
• Continually improve customer service and satisfaction levels; 
• Improve operational energy efficiency;  
• Reduce our impact on the environment;  
• Cut costs and raise revenue through improved waste 
recycling; 
• Enhance and promote our customer proposition in relation 
to product reuse and recycling; 
• Monitor and reduce carbon emissions; 
• Offer safe and reliable own-brand products achieved as  
a result of our expert technical knowledge with products 
sourced from manufacturers which are audited against  
our ethical requirements; and

activity and charitable causes. 
Our approach to sustainability means taking business 
decisions that reflect these priorities, based on our values  
and guided by our values and code of business ethics.  
People 
Good people are pivotal to our success and therefore our 
biggest investment. They are both the foundation and face of 
our business and key to continued innovation and delivering 
excellent service to our customers. 
We place a huge emphasis on attracting and retaining the right 
people. We listen to, and work with, employees to help them 
reach their full potential while building a diverse, rewarding 
environment where they feel empowered and inspired to help 
us grow and succeed. 
We are working to be recognised as an employer of choice 
and aim to reward colleagues fairly, providing equal 
opportunities, personal development and training.  
Our employee benefits packages are regularly reviewed to 
remain attractive and conducive to the recruitment and 
retention of talented individuals. Colleagues are encouraged  
to participate in our SAYE Scheme to build a personal stake  
in the business. Our first combined Dixons Carphone SAYE 
scheme in the UK and Ireland was launched with 20% of 
colleagues electing to join. 
We work to achieve high standards in employment practices 
and have a comprehensive suite of employment policies and 
procedures, which we regularly review. These policies include 
guidance on being family friendly through to colleague dispute 
management, diversity and equal opportunities. 
We have a dedicated Corporate Responsibility function and 
are a member of the UK Government’s All-Party Parliamentary 
Corporate Responsibility Group.  
Our Values 
Our culture supports the discovery of new and better ways of 
working, two-way communication and the speedy resolution of 
concerns and queries.  
We are cultivating a high performance environment where each 
employee performs to the best of their ability, working together 
to achieve untold possibilities.

Corporate responsibility 
28 
The Dixons Carphone Ethical Conduct Policy applies to all 
employees and relevant managers are required to sign an 
annual statement to confirm their compliance. 
Our employees’ performance and engagement is measured via 
a balanced scorecard, and alongside our values and strategy, 
this scorecard is used to run our business, help us to make the 
right decisions and recognise success. This is done at a 
company, market and on an individual level.  
One Dixons Carphone Team 
One of our key priorities post-Merger is to build one culture, 
one vision and one future. A major step towards this is locating 
support centre colleagues in one site. 
The decision to choose Acton as our main support function 
site was made based on a set of criteria which included square 
footage, car parking facilities and access to public transport.  
We will relocate up to 1,000 colleagues from our Hemel 
Hempstead site by November 2015, before the site closes on 
31 December 2015.  
Our Acton site remains fully functional while refurbishment 
work takes place. This is aided by the introduction of Smart 
Working - a flexible approach to time spent in the office, 
designed to drive greater efficiency and effectiveness as well 
as creating a more fluid working environment. We are building 
a workplace tailored for the needs of our people.  
‘Change Champions’ for each function have been identified  
to help the move run smoothly and all colleagues have been 
surveyed for their input and are being communicated with 
throughout the process. 
We are working to achieve the following design principles: 
• One Dixons Carphone Team  
• Tech Enabled colleagues 
• Flexibility and Healthy Work-Life Balance  
• Improved facilities 
• A vibrant working environment.  
Colleague Communications 
We run a comprehensive colleague engagement programme 
based on our belief that an engaged workforce will deliver a 
great customer experience, resulting in strong financial results. 
Our key aims for this programme are to fully integrate our 
workforce and instil pride in working for Dixons Carphone.  
September will see the launch of a colleague engagement 
survey across the Group, administered by an external provider. 
Colleagues will have the opportunity to say how they feel about 
working for Dixons Carphone and this feedback will be used  
to develop initiatives to ensure our company is a great place  
to work.  
In the UK & Ireland we are continuing to integrate online 
communications channels to provide modern and effective 
platforms with an emphasis on collaboration and peer-to-peer 
communication. We will continue to produce ‘Connected’, a 
hard copy employee magazine, which launched on the day of 
the Merger and is a key channel for sharing news and 
company progress. 
Strengthening Capabilities 
To help our people to grow their careers at Dixons Carphone 
and develop the skills needed to perform well in their role and 
help to grow our business we provide formal training, on the 
job experience and management coaching. 
We have a learning strategy to support our business strategy 
and individuals have regular one-to-ones and a formal review 
twice a year with their manager to assess their performance 
and set clear goals and development plans for the year ahead.  
Across Dixons Carphone around 96,000 learning hours were 
recorded last year with over 80% of this learning completed 
online. This year, we launched our Retail Academy for all new 
store colleagues joining our business. We also run talent and 
leadership development programmes to develop high 
achievers and to improve leadership skills across our 
management population. 
Health and Wellbeing  
Through the promotion of employee wellbeing, we aim to 
create a happier, healthier and more productive workforce,  
at the same time as reducing time off through sickness and 
ensuring optimum levels of energy and resilience. 
Healthy living is encouraged through a number of initiatives 
and facilities. On-site gyms are available in many of our main 
support centres and a new fitness centre is planned as part of 
the refurbishment of our Head Office building in North Acton. 
Relaxation rooms where employees can watch TV, play pool, 
play video games or take time out are provided in Support 
Functions along with on-site restaurants offering a range of 
foods, which are reviewed regularly to ensure they offer a 
balanced menu. 
Our Employee Assistance Programme, which is available 24/7, 
is available to all our employees and offers a range of 
information about issues such as stress and nutrition.  
A number of products and services are also available to 
support employees, such as private medical insurance. This is 
also available to their close family at subsidised rates. Dental 
insurance and a Health Cash Plan are also available at special 
corporate rates for employees who wish to participate.  
Specific areas of the business also offer support in other ways 
too. For example, at our Support Centre in Acton a 
physiotherapist comes in regularly and offers treatments to 
employees at reduced rates.    Dixons Carphone plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014/15

 Average to Awesome 
 This wellbeing initiative focused on twelve employees from 
our UK business with the aim of transforming their overall 
aptitude to health and fitness. With the help of a dedicated 
personal trainer and tailored nutrition plan, we recorded their 
combined weight loss at 30.7kg over the 12 week period. 
These employees developed a strong bond and have 
continued positive changes to their lifestyle habits, resulting 
in the easing of conditions such as breathlessness and type 
2 diabetes in individuals, while all twelve are enjoying 
increased energy levels and enhanced performance. We are 
repeating this programme again in 2015 introducing the 
latest wearable technology. 
Equal Opportunities 
The Group is committed to equality of opportunity across all of 
its employment practices throughout the Group. We strive to 
prevent unlawful discrimination in the workplace on the 
grounds of sex, race, disability, sexual orientation, religion or 
religious belief, age, marriage and civil partnership, gender 
reassignment, pregnancy and maternity. We promote an 
honest and open environment and encourage colleagues with 
concerns to report issues to us either directly through line 
managers or via an independent, confidential integrity line. 
Disability 
We are committed to providing colleagues with equal 
opportunities, from recruitment to training and development. 
We encourage applications from individuals with disabilities 
who can do the job and candidates will be considered for  
each role they apply for. Every effort is made to retain  
disabled colleagues in our employment including making  
any reasonable readjustments to their jobs, workplace  
or environment. 
Diversity 
We appreciate the benefits a diverse workplace brings, 
including, but not restricted to gender diversity and the 
importance diversity plays in achieving the right mix of skills, 
knowledge and experience our organisation needs to reach  
its potential.  
Diversity in terms of age and gender remains a key 
performance indicator. Statistics for the UK, Ireland and 
Nordics are as follows: 
 All employees Senior managers Directors

Female 11,157 29% 99 28% 3 23% 
 
Customers  
Every decision we make is driven by our ambition to provide 
unparalleled expertise and services to help customers and 
businesses navigate the new digital era. 
Each and Every Customer Counts programme 
Our Each and Every Customer Counts (EECC) programme is 
supported by a full suite of customer insight measures, driving 
daily, weekly and monthly improvements in our customer 
experience. Each employee is accountable on some level for 
our lead customer measure. Our NPS features in all our internal 
reward schemes and is central to our company balanced 
scorecard. We have seen NPS improvements of 9% year  
on year to March 2015. 
We run a weekly and monthly EECC dash board with key 
measures and targets laddering up to NPS and completing our 
omni-channel customer journey. Our customer insight 
programme collects feedback from over 850,000 customers 
per year via each of our channels and touch points. Feedback 
mechanisms include mystery shopping, exit surveys and SMS 
feedback via text messages immediately following a customer 
purchase. This programme allows us to track a further 15 
customer KPIs, out of which seven hit or exceeded targets for 
the year and a further four showed improvement.  
Our governance programme for customer experience sits at 
executive and senior level within our business, underlining its 
importance to our strategy and day to day thinking. Weekly 
Voice of the Customer meetings are used to implement 
improvement plans when performance targets are not  
being reached.  
We want to be the preferred brand and within our key target 
market we have seen an 8% improvement year on year for the 
three months to April 2015. Our ultimate goal is to drive both 
preference and real loyalty with our customers. Improving 
customers’ value for money is also critical in a highly 
competitive market and again we have seen significant 
improvements on value for money ratings across the year 
within our key target customers, with a 16% improvement  
year on year.   Dixons Carphone plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014/15

Customer retention is another measure we take very seriously, 
reflected by beating our target by 6%. Our customer 
experience plan has identified key areas for improvement and 
we have invested heavily to fix these. We constantly 
communicate with customers through dedicated panels and 
every new initiative starts with customer insight. This year we 
ran over 100 customer focus groups using a combination of 
qualitative focus groups and co-creation sessions. Large 
quantitative and online surveys are also run for additional data 
and customer review sites are tracked and used to inform how 
we can continually improve.  
We have been recognised by customers and independent third 
parties for the customer experience we strive to create for each 
and every customer. Our rating on Trust Pilot is now 7.2/10 
and is the highest in the mobile industry. 
Carphone Warehouse Customer Service Awards include

KNOWHOW  
At the KNOWHOW Contact Centre in Sheffield we support  
the UK & Ireland retail customer base on behalf of both the 
Currys and PC World brands in every step of their journey  
with our business. 
Prior to purchase our Sales team support with product 
selection and advice, post purchase we have teams to support 
every step of the way from Delivery enquiries to Technical 
advice including our dedicated Careplan Team. 
Our team of over 1,300 colleagues support customers seven 
days a week, with our Technical homeworking team covering 
365 days around the clock for support with PC and 
connectivity issues. Across the teams in our busiest week this 
year we handled enquiries from over 300,000 customers and 
have significantly improved our response times across all  
areas of contact, with particular focus on our Social Media  
and Email channels. 
We offer a great career path across Home Services, with 
Apprenticeships in our Technical team, through to a Pathway 
programme for all colleagues, giving all of our team an 
opportunity to develop their career, through to becoming an 
expert colleague, before moving into coaching and line 
management roles. Many of our First Line Managers, 
Customer Operations Managers and indeed our leadership 
team have followed a career in such a way, there are no limits 
to a career across our business. 
 
We ask our team to work with a simple three stage process: 
1. Understand the customer need or concern 
2. Propose a solution product or service 
3. Thank you and feedback 
We work to ensure we are fair and reasonable in all proposed 
solutions for our customers and ask our team to always 
consider how we can improve our process to deliver clear and 
consistent responses. 
Across our E-Commerce and Insight teams we work with 
Reevoo, one of the leading independent Customer Review 
sites to share customer reviews of our services and over the 
past 6 months we have scored 78% for Customer Service 
from over 18,000 customer reviews. 
 
Contact Centres are known for working within a framework 
built upon Average Handling Time for a response and within 
the KNOWHOW site we have changed the way we look at this 
‘AHT’ measure. We coach our colleagues on taking the 
Appropriate Handling Time with every customer, allowing us to 
train our colleagues to handle customers more personally as 
we strive to never leave a customer to fend for themselves. 
We also provide SMS surveys to our customers across our 
sites to define the Advocacy, Care and Knowledge scores for 
our colleagues and use these as critical KPIs to improve 
process and performance for the future. 
This year KNOWHOW and Carphone Warehouse colleagues 
will work closely to understand their strengths and define the 
future support modelling for our new business across our 
entire Contact Centre Portfolio. We now have over 2,500 
Contact Centre colleagues supporting our customers. 
Information Security 
The Group is committed to protecting both electronic and 
physical information from unauthorised access, processing, 
modification or destruction. There are a number of pieces of 
legislation relevant to information security to which the Group 
adheres, including the Data Protection Act 1998 and EU’s Data 
Protection Directive 95/46/EC. The Group has a dedicated 
information security team. Security controls and awareness 
remain an area of significant focus for the Board.  
Data protection 
The Group has a responsibility to ensure all information is 
collected, stored, processed and disposed of in a secure way. 
In the UK, we are required to adhere to the UK Data Protection 
Act 1998. This legislation was enacted to bring UK law in line 
with the EU Data Protection Directive, which is applicable to 
the rest of the Group’s European markets. The European 
Commission is in the process of implementing a European 
Data Protection Regulation which will supersede the Directive. 
Ahead of the adoption of the new regulation, the business is 
working closely with the Group Data Protection Officer to 
prepare for the changes in this area. The Group is committed 
to the on-going monitoring of its data protection policies  
and procedures, and the implementation of improvements 
where necessary.   Dixons Carphone plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014/15

Environment  
Energy Management 
Dixons Carphone continues its advanced activities surrounding 
energy efficiency. Our portfolio continues to be predominantly 
supplied through half hourly metering which allows us to 
monitor our sites accurately, minimise wastage, optimise  
our efficiency and invest with energy efficiency projects in 
targeted areas.  
As we move into 2015/16, we are working to extend this  
half hourly monitoring programme to over 600 Carphone 
Warehouse stores. 
To realise immediate benefits, our energy efficiency 
programme continues to utilise internal capital expenditure 
funding for energy efficiency projects. We continue to explore 
new technologies and advanced strategies to assist in our 
programme of energy reduction and through 2014/15, a further 
£1.4 million has been invested in new energy efficiency 
initiatives including: 
1. Variable Speed drives have rolled out to a further 80 Currys 
and PC World superstores to optimise the efficiency of 
their heating, ventilation and air conditioning systems 
2. New efficient fluorescent lighting has been fitted in  
27 large Currys and PC World superstores. 
3. Energy-efficiency projects have been completed in an 
additional 26 stores to further optimise our energy usage  
which include fine adjustments to temperature set points, 
controlled heating and lighting strategies and the 
installation of lighting controls. 
4. Efficient LED lighting has been trialled in back of house 
areas which we intend to roll out to further stores. 
5. The 65,000 sq ft Customer Call Centre in Sheffield has 
been upgraded to LED lighting throughout. 
The resulting reduction in our energy consumption from the 
above initiatives will be approximately 7,000 mWh per annum 
and will reduce our carbon emissions by over 3,500 tonnes of 
CO2 in the next year. 
 
 
 
 
 
 Energy Efficiency Initiative 
 Dixons Carphone is delighted to have been selected to 
participate in the Department of Energy & Climate Change – 
EDR (Energy Demand Reduction) pilot scheme. This initiative 
is linked to the large scale rollout of energy efficient LED 
lighting to one of our 750,000 sq ft National Distribution 
Centre buildings in Newark. It represents our largest 
investment in a single energy efficiency project to date and  
is on schedule to complete by September 2015. 
Our water leak detection programme continues through 
consumption analysis to highlight irregularities and ensures 
optimum efficiency. 
Carbon Management 
During Phase 2, year 1 of the Carbon Reduction Commitment 
(CRC) energy efficiency scheme, Dixons Carphone combined 
reported emissions show a reduction against 2013/14 of 
approximately 7% which represents a reduction in excess of 
9,000 tonnes of CO2. 
Dixons Carphone will merge its reporting against the Carbon 
Reduction Commitment (CRC) energy efficiency scheme for 
2015/16. Reporting for 2014/15 will be completed in line with 
previous years under Dixons Retail plc (CRC registration 
number 8584817) and Carphone Warehouse Group plc  
(CRC registration number 6030144). 
 Green Energy in the Nordics 
 We have made the decision to implement the exclusive  
use of ‘Green Energy’ produced by hydropower and wind 
turbines across our sites in the Nordics. At present, energy is 
derived from nuclear and oil (fossil) sources which generate a 
CO2 output of 42,604 tonnes per annum. This initiative will 
dramatically reduce this figure. Each store will receive a 
certificate as proof of the environmental contribution and we 
will use this in national, regional and local media to promote 
our green profile. 
Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP) – due to the merger and the 
associated challenges of identifying a complete baseline year, 
the Group will not be participating in the Carbon Disclosure 
Project for 2014/15. We are currently considering whether to 
respond to the CDP Climate Change Information Disclosure 
questionnaire and the CDP Road to Paris 2015 Commitments 
in 2015/16.    Dixons Carphone plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014/15

(1) Exclusions comprise: Franchises as they do not fall directly under 
the Group’s operational control. Emissions from Carphone 
Warehouse’s retail operations in France have been excluded as an 
agreement in principle has been reached for the sale of Dixons 
Carphone’s operations in this territory. Following Dixons 
Carphone’s announcements on 15 April and 24 April, business 
interests in Germany and the Netherlands have been included  
in this 2014/15 GHG reporting, however will be excluded from 
future reporting. 
(2) Emissions generated within properties occupied by the Group 
 but operated by the relevant landlord and refrigerant data from 
Nordics are excluded as data was not available (although this  
is estimated to be approximately 1% of total emissions for  
the Group). 
(3) Emissions from the combustion of fuel comprises an increased 
data set due to identified wider scope from 2013/14. 
(4) Overall floor area of the Dixons Retail business is estimated to be 
16,845,934 sq ft (2013/14: 17,052,000 sq ft) and the calculations 
use the methodology set out in DEFRA’s updated greenhouse gas 
reporting guidance, Environmental Reporting Guidelines (ref. PB 
13944), issued in June 2013. 
(5) We have synchronised the emissions intensity measure for the 
Carphone Warehouse portfolio to tonnes CO2 emitted per  
1,000 sq ft of floor area for this reporting year. As such,  
an intensity measure comparison against last year would be 
difficult, however, this will allow data to be merged in future. 
Overall floor area of the Carphone Warehouse business is 
estimated to be 2,106,753 sq ft and as with Dixons Retail, the 
calculations use the methodology set out in DEFRA’s updated 
greenhouse gas reporting guidance, Environmental Reporting 
Guidelines (ref. PB 13944), issued in June 2013.  
(6) 2014/15 Carphone Warehouse GHG reporting includes emissions 
from directly owned and leased vehicles, company cars, and 
delivery fleets which were not included in 2013/14. 
 
Waste and recycling  
We have driven sustainability and efficiencies through refuse 
and recycling across the Group. In the last year, 75% of 
material generated by our stores now goes to recycling 
schemes and not into landfill.  
We now backhaul our recyclables from 386 CurrysPCWorld 
stores, an increase of 239 stores year on year, to our recycling 
machinery in Newark. Stores return these recyclable materials 
via the return leg of the delivery vehicles. In addition to 
cardboard, polythene and expanded polystyrene we recycled 
from our stores last year, we have extended the programme to 
include paper recycling. As a group we are now one of the 
UK’s single biggest recyclers of expanded polystyrene.  
We have increased the volume of card, expended polystyrene 
and polythene recyclate processed from our customer service 
centres and Newark sites by 25% or 1,347 tonnes. 
In the Nordics we participate in national take-back schemes,  
in addition to handling waste at store and home deliveries. 
There are also strict procedures in place for sorting and 
reporting in all markets. 
Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment (WEEE) 
Over 66,000 tonnes of WEEE was recycled in 2014/15, which 
is an increase of 5,000 tonnes (8%) on 2013/14. Our volume 
represents over 15% of the total UK WEEE market. We 
recycled over 1.2 million white goods last year and backfilled 
over 10,000 trailers that would have returned to base empty.  
We have allowed a wide range of re-use companies and FRN 
charities access to all 16 of our CSC depots to select white 
goods units they feel are reuseable resulting in over 60,000 
units last year being diverted from a scrap yard for destruction 
to be cleaned, refurbished and reused, for example, by low 
income families in many different regions of the UK. Not only  
is there a social benefit to reuse, it also has an environmental 
benefit and saved around 6,000 tonnes of carbon.   Dixons Carphone plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014/15
Strategic report
 
33 
The Group processed 16,381 handsets and 248 non-mobile 
items, with the proceeds paid into the CPW Foundation to 
support charitable activity.  
The total WEEE collected in the Nordics is 93,606 tonnes with 
a recovery rate of 77% material, 22% thermic / incineration 
and 1% landfill.  
Transport and Delivery 
Our Home Delivery Fleet continues to grow in response to 
increasing demand. We carried out 1,426,577 deliveries in 
2014/15 by our operated fleet compared to 957,630 in 
2013/14. The fleet covered 19,871,184 km which is an increase 
of 32.6% year on year, with CO2 emissions at 9,311 tonnes, an 
increase of 44% on last year. These increases are due mainly 
to the higher proportion of deliveries carried out on our own 
operated fleet versus fleet operated by our franchises, in 
comparison to last year.  
We took delivery of a further fifty 7.5 tonne Euro 5 vehicles – 
the last batch we will procure before switching to the new Euro 
6 vehicles in line with new emissions legislation. These vehicles 
have been fitted with forward facing cameras and tracking 
which has also been rolled out to our white goods repair vans 
to help us with accident reduction initiatives. Also this year, we 
consolidated the Carphone Warehouse branch delivery fleet 
with a specific element of the Currys and PC World branch 
delivery network utilising the existing fleet, enabling us to 
realise some of the benefits of the combined network. 
Combined DHL Fleet 
Although our carbon emissions are up year on year, we have 
driven efficiencies on the combined DHL fleet. 
Fleet emissions are at 16,311 tonnes for 2014/15, this is an 
increase of 11% year on year with miles driven also up 11%  
at 14,041,859. Transported volume is up by 12% year on year 
and 31% over two years. Cube delivered per mile driven has 
decreased by 1.14%. Overall combined trailer fill is up by 
1.03m
3
 per vehicle year on year or 1.79%. This efficiency has 
saved an additional 500 road trips. 
For 2015/16, we will look to capitalise on year on year and two 
year performances and progress. A complete review of the 
existing tractor and trailer fleet has been undertaken and we 
will remove and replace older trailers. We will also introduce 
more premium cube trailers into the network with a greater 
carrying capacity and are involved in on-going discussions  
in relation to tractor units. As part of our on-going Network 
Design review for 2015/16, strategic locations will be 
introduced to allow us to reduce our stem mileage from  
the central distribution point in Newark. 
In the Nordics, the number of kilometres driven from our 
Nordic Distribution centre to stores is 11.85 million which  
is up 2.5%. 
Supplier relationships 
We are committed to upholding and respecting human  
rights. While we do not operate a separate human rights policy, 
these values are reflected in our equal opportunity practices 
throughout the Group and in our ethical policies and 
processes. We expect all our suppliers to operate in a fair  
and honest way towards their employees and those with 
whom they do business. 
Charity and Community  
We aim to be a responsible member of every community  
we do business in, whether it’s by match-funding employee 
fundraising, community initiatives or charity partnerships, we 
will implement new ideas to make a positive impact locally.  
The business contributed a total of £935,000 to charitable 
causes in the UK & Ireland and a further NOK 1.9 million 
(£154,000) in the Nordics.  
Get Connected 
Dixons Carphone continued Carphone Warehouse’s long term 
support of Get Connected. This registered charity is the UK’s 
only free, confidential helpline for under 25s who need help 
with any issue, providing support and counselling for those 
experiencing problems with mental and emotional health. 
Young people can access Get Connected by phone, email, 
web-chat or text. They may also use WebHelp 24/7, the online 
help directory.  
Last year we raised £323,000 for Get Connected through 
activities such as Carphone Warehouse Race to the Stones,  
a supplier quiz, Give As You Earn and individual colleague 
fundraising. The majority of these funds were raised through 
the Dixons Carphone Charity Dinner and Auction.  
In 2014/15 Dixons Carphone also contributed £160,000  
to accommodate the Get Connected helpline service in  
office space.  
We have worked closely with Get Connected to reduce their 
dependency on our business. As a result, the charity has 
secured funding from The Cabinet Office and The Department 
of Education and continues to grow its trading income.  
In response to business demand, Get Connected now offer 
remote helpline volunteering opportunities for local 
communities and employees, including those with mobility 
restrictions who are prevented from participating in many 
traditional forms of volunteering.  
In 2014/15, Get Connected helped 250,000 children and young 
people in crisis which is an increase of 100,000 year on year. 
 Dixons Carphone Foundation Charity Dinner and Auction 
 March 2015 saw our first joint fundraising event in aid of our 
new Dixons Carphone Foundation. This event was supported 
and attended by suppliers and partners from across the 
business, raising a record breaking net total of £427,000.  
This figure includes a donation of £213,000 by Dixons 
Carphone after we pledged to triple the income taken  
during the live Auction.  
 From these proceeds, Get Connected received £214,000, 
Tablets for Schools will receive £200,000 with £14,000 being 
paid into the Foundation to support causes that leverage 
technology to address social issues.    Dixons Carphone plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014/15

Tablets for Schools 
We believe the use of technology in education can inspire 
children with a lifelong love of learning, motivate them to know 
more and empower independent thinking. Tablets for Schools 
is a registered charity behind the largest independent research 
programme in the world into the use of 1:1 technology to 
transform education.  
The real benefits have been defined, the major issues for 
schools uncovered and robust data around pedagogy, 
attainment, cost savings and the impact on behaviour / 
attendance is being gathered.  
In 2014/15 Dixons Carphone continued its support of the work 
of this charity, donating a total of £210,000. The Company also 
made the charity a loan of £150,000 in lieu of income from our 
Charity Dinner and Auction.  
In January 2015, Tablets for Schools relaunched as 
Techknowledge for Schools with the aim of helping schools  
by providing a united vision and blueprint for the successful 
deployment of technology in education to transform  
learning outcomes. 
The Dixons Carphone Foundation 
The Foundation is a fundraising account established under the 
Charities Aid Foundation (registered charity number: 268369) 
for the benefit of the charity or charities selected by Dixons 
Carphone and approved by the Charities Aid Foundation. 
This account was set up in March 2015 to deliver our ambition 
of making lives better through technology. The Dixons 
Carphone Foundation will also facilitate employee match-
funding applications and one off donations to emergencies and 
disaster funds. 
Through the Dixons Carphone Foundation, employees can 
apply for support with sponsorship. The Foundation will match 
the amount an employee has raised for their chosen charity by 
up to £100 or £300 for a team fundraising for the same event. 
In 2013/14 we donated £36,000 to a variety of causes through 
the CPW Foundation. 
We are in the process of closing the CPW Foundation and 
transferring the balance of £41,000 to the new Dixons 
Carphone Charities Aid Foundation (CAF) Account.  
 
 
The DSG international Foundation  
The DSG international Foundation is a charity in its own right, 
registered with the Charities Commission. For the time being  
we will continue to operate charitable activities through our 
new CAF account Dixons Carphone Foundation. 
During 2014/15, a total of £73,000 was transacted through the 
DSG international Foundation for Children in Need. The 
balance of this account stands at £18,000.  
Give As You Earn 
We encourage employees to contribute to charities of their 
choosing through our payroll giving scheme. In 2014/15 Dixons 
Carphone employees donated a combined total of £49,000 
benefitting a wide range of causes. 
Other charitable support  
Dixons continued their support of Children in Need enabling 
colleagues across our store, service and logistics networks  
to get behind fundraising efforts for a nationally branded 
fundraising event that supports causes across the UK and 
local to their places of work. As a result of a number of 
activities, total fundraising and donations to Children in  
Need were £75,000.  
Senior Dixons Carphone executives took to the tennis courts 
for a charity tennis tournament at The Queens Club raising 
£50,000 for the Dallaglio Foundation and their work to inspire 
and change the lives of young people through sport. 
Our Sheffield Contact Centre supported the live Comic Relief 
television appeal by taking donation calls. 150 colleagues, 
friends and family gave up their free time to take £62,000  
in pledges. 
The Company responded to the Ebola Crisis at the request of 
the World Health Organisation (WHO) through the provision  
of 200 fully functioning smartphones, allowing WHO field 
operatives to collect key data in real time in Sierra Leone, 
Guinea and Liberia. The gift in kind value to our business  
was £20,000.  
 Carphone Warehouse Race to the Stones 
 On 19 and 20 July 2014 over 1,600 public participants ran, 
trekked or walked 100km from Chinnor in Oxfordshire along 
the Ridgeway to the ancient stone circle in Avebury. This was 
the first time Carphone Warehouse sponsored a charity 
sporting event and over 130 employees signed up to get fit 
and raise over £45,000 for our charity partner, Get 
Connected. Sponsorship of this event continues for 2015  
as the Dixons Carphone Race to the Stones. Over 250 
employees from across Dixons Carphone will take part,  
many of them trialling wearable technology for training.    Dixons Carphone plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014/15

Spring Online  
This initiative run by the charity Digital Unite, aims to help the 
6.4 million people who are digitally excluded in the UK. 
Carphone Warehouse’s sponsorship in 2014 enabled this work 
to continue and amplified the work of the charity resulting in  
a 426% increase (32,800 views) in traffic to our branded 
smartphone and tablets area of the Digital Unite website.  
We saw a five-fold increase in store participation year on year 
providing us with the opportunity to engage with the over 50’s 
and establish trust in a rapidly expanding market with no 
previous brand loyalty. The Spring Online taster sessions 
created a unique way in which to show prospective customers 
how to use products through employee engagement and 
initiated an advocacy through staff, attendees, event holders 
and communities across the UK.  
Outside the UK 
Elkjøp continues to support the Red Cross Water for Life  
(Vann for Livet) project and donated approximately NOK  
1.9 million (£154,000) to the Red Cross Water for Life Project 
during 2014/15. 
Key Performance Indicators 
The performance criteria reported above are largely focused  
on the Group’s UK & Ireland and the Nordics businesses which 
represent 92% of the Group revenues from continuing 
operations in the period.

Chairman’s introduction 
It is with great pleasure that I present to you my introduction  
to the Corporate Governance section of the first Annual Report 
and Accounts as Dixons Carphone plc. The bringing together 
and alignment of two great businesses with a joint strategy and 
direction is truly exciting but it is never more important than 
now, in this time of change, that our corporate governance 
practices and procedures are well designed and implemented. 
It is my intention to set out how the Company has embraced 
good corporate governance practice and how we will use  
this to form a stable foundation to the building of  
shareholder value. 
Corporate Governance 
Good corporate governance is at the heart of any well-run 
business. We receive a corporate governance update at every 
other board meeting from our internal experts and have 
reviewed and updated our policies and procedures, following 
the Merger, to comply with the latest best practice standards. 
We have clearly differentiated the roles of Group Chief 
Executive (to run the business) and Chairman (to run the 
Board). Our role descriptions (including that of the Senior 
Independent Director) and our other board policies, such as 
diversity, time commitment, external appointments and 
external advice have all been renewed and refreshed. The 
Board will look to adopt the 2014 version of the UK Corporate 
Governance Code and will report against it in its 2015/16 
annual report and accounts. The Board, in conjunction  
with the Audit Committee, is considering the business  
viability statement.  
Board composition and role 
The members of the Board were announced at the time of the 
Merger and remain the same except for the departure of John 
Allan. Consideration is currently being given to replacement for 
John Allan as Senior Independent Director and the Board will 
update shareholders once a decision has been taken. The 
resignation of the Senior Independent Director (SID), coming 
swiftly as it did following the Merger, has illustrated the need 
for succession planning which will have an increased focus 
over the next year. 
The Nominations Committee reviews each year the 
composition of the Board, including the independence and 
commitment to the Company shown by the non-executive 
directors during the year. That review also includes gender, 
professional and international diversity. The Board has three 
female directors, one of whom is based out of the UK and 
provides strong support on matters relating to the European 
business. Following this year’s review it was concluded that 
the Board had all necessary skills and experience to discharge 
its duties fully and to challenge management effectively  
where necessary.  
As part of the annual reviews, the non-executive directors were 
asked to confirm that they continue to have enough time to 
dedicate to company business and all have formally done so. 
As a unitary board the directors acknowledge their joint 
responsibility for our success. We have clearly differentiated 
the roles between executive management running the business 
and our non-executives, who provide the appropriate level of 
scrutiny. In this way, the Board works together to challenge 
and interrogate as well as support each other with the aim 
being effective decision making, leadership and accountability 
for all aspects of the business.  
Induction 
Following the Merger, each director was given the opportunity 
to get to know each side of the business, through a 
combination of formal presentations, store visits and informal 
discussions. The Audit Committee had its own induction 
process including access to auditor’s reports and full 
supporting documentation for both sides of the business which 
provided an excellent understanding of the inherited position.  
Board evaluation 
The Board agreed that an internal review would be appropriate 
for the Board evaluation this year. It was conducted by the 
Company Secretary and took the form of a questionnaire 
completed by all Directors on several aspects of the Board and 
its organisation. The main finding was that the Board had 
come together well in support of the business and that there 
was an atmosphere of openness enabling effective challenge 
and debate. In 2016 the external board evaluation is due for 
Dixons Carphone. This timing will provide the newly merged 
Board and its procedures ample time and opportunity to 
embed fully, with the next evaluation process providing 
valuable insight and results which will be reported to 
shareholders in the 2015/16 annual report and accounts. 
Committee structure 
The main board committees are the Audit, Nominations and 
Remuneration Committees, and a section of this report is 
dedicated to each of them. Beneath Board level there are 
further management level committees which report back to  
the Board as necessary. 
Conclusion 
We have a strong, balanced board supported by sound 
policies and procedures and I believe it is well placed to  
take the opportunities that the future will bring. I look  
forward to meeting you, along with my fellow directors,  
at this year’s Annual General Meeting.

Corporate Governance statement 
The Board confirms that during the period ended 2 May 2015 
and as at the date of this Annual Report and Accounts, the 
Company has, except to the extent stated below, been in 
compliance with the 2012 UK Corporate Governance Code 
(the Code).  
It is noted that the Company has not had a named director 
operating as Senior Independent Director (SID) since the 
resignation of John Allan. During that time the remaining 
independent directors have all been available to discuss items 
with the Chairman as necessary and to discuss matters with 
shareholders should this be required. The Company is 
currently considering the replacement for John Allan and  
will update shareholders once the ongoing exercise has  
been completed. 
This report, together with the Directors’ report and the reports 
from the Audit, Nominations and Remuneration Committees 
together provide details of how the Company has applied the 
principles and complied with the provisions of the Code during 
the year. The Code can be obtained from the Financial 
Reporting Council’s website, www.frc.org.uk. 
Board responsibilities 
The overriding responsibility of the Board is to provide clear, 
entrepreneurial and responsible leadership to the Group within 
a framework of efficient and effective controls so as to allow 
the key issues and risks facing the business to be assessed 
and managed. 
Composition of the Board 
The Board has 13 members, six of whom are considered by 
the Company to be independent non ‑executive directors. 
These directors are John Gildersleeve, Andrea Gisle Joosen, 
Tim How, Jock Lennox, Baroness Morgan of Huyton and Gerry 
Murphy. Half the directors excluding the Chairman are 
therefore considered to be independent in accordance  
with the Code.  
It is noted that John Gildersleeve was a non-executive director 
of Old Carphone Warehouse for more than nine years but the 
Board does not believe this affects his independence having 
given detailed consideration to his performance and the extent 
to which he has shown himself to be independent of 
management in thought and action during the period under 
review. As a result, the Company confirms that John 
Gildersleeve continues to show independence in his  
scrutiny and challenge to the Company and directors and 
therefore continues to be classified as an independent non-
executive director. 
Each of the directors will stand for election / re-election at the 
Company’s Annual General Meeting. Biographical information 
is shown on pages 36 and 37. 
The division of responsibility between the Chairman and the 
Group Chief Executive is formally defined, set out in writing 
and is reviewed by the Board on an annual basis, as it was on 
9 March 2015. The Chairman is responsible for the overall 
operation, leadership and governance of the Board. The Group 
Chief Executive is responsible for the executive management 
of the Group’s business and for implementing the Group’s 
strategic and commercial objectives. 
The role of the SID is to support the Chairman and be available 
for approach or representation from shareholders who feel they 
are unable to raise issues with the Chairman directly. Since the 
resignation of John Allan the Board has operated without a 
SID. The Board has a strong line up of independent non-
executive directors who have all been available for the 
shareholders to contact in absence of a formal SID. Under the 
role of the SID, which is clearly defined, set out in writing and 
reviewed annually by the Board, the SID also discusses, with 
the Chairman the results of his performance review. This role 
was undertaken by Jock Lennox for the 2015 review.    Dixons Carphone plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014/15

Board governance matters 
The Chairman is responsible for ensuring that all directors are 
properly briefed on issues arising at Board meetings and that 
they have full and timely access to relevant information. The 
Company uses an electronic board paper system which 
enables the fast dissemination of quality information in a safe 
and secure manner. All Board papers are sent out on a timely 
basis with sufficient information for the directors to be able to 
discharge their duties. Formal minutes of the Board and 
Committee meetings are prepared by the Company Secretary 
and approved by the Board / Committees at their next meeting. 
The Chairman meets regularly with all the non-executive 
directors, usually on an evening prior to a Board meeting when 
board dinners are held. This provides the opportunity to 
discuss amongst other matters, corporate strategy and 
business performance. 
The Board holds meetings at a variety of the Group’s locations 
to help all Board members gain a deeper understanding of the 
business. This also provides senior management from across 
the Group with the opportunity to meet the Board. Whilst no 
visits took place for the period under review, in May 2015, the 
Board held a meeting at its distribution centre in Newark and in 
June 2015 held another meeting at its headquarters in Norway. 
This enabled the Board to meet members of the team and 
senior management and to visit stores and other elements of 
the Group’s business. 
New directors appointed to the Board receive a tailored 
induction programme, together with guidance and training 
appropriate to their level of previous experience. Each director 
is given the opportunity to meet with senior management and 
store colleagues and to visit the Group’s sites both in the UK 
and overseas. This enables familiarisation with the businesses, 
operations, systems and markets in which the Group operates. 
New directors are also encouraged to meet with the Group’s 
auditor and advisors. 
The Board receives an update on corporate governance best 
practice at every other meeting. 
Performance evaluation  
The internal annual review of Board effectiveness and the 
balance of skills, knowledge and experience of the directors 
was conducted as usual during the period under review. In 
addition, the Code recommends that the performance of the 
Board be reviewed externally every three years. The last 
external review of the Company was carried out by NJMD 
Corporate Services in May 2013; therefore the next external 
evaluation is due in 2016. 
The internal review this year involved: 
• individual directors responding to separate questionnaires 
which were collated by the Company Secretary. The results 
were then presented to and discussed by the Board and a 
plan of action established to address any areas of 
improvement. The areas covered included, but were not 
limited to, the roles of the executive and non-executive 
directors, the Board, Board Committees, the Chairman, 
preparation for and performance at meetings, the 
effectiveness of each director, leadership, culture and 
corporate governance. As part of this evaluation, the 
Chairman discussed any personal development needs  
that were identified with each director;  
• In the absence of a SID at the time of the performance 
evaluation, Jock Lennox reviewed the results of the 
performance evaluation questionnaire completed by all of 
the directors apart from the Chairman on the Chairman’s 
performance. He then discussed the results of that review 
with the Chairman and an action plan was prepared. The 
Board is of the opinion that the Chairman had no other 
significant commitments during the year that adversely 
affected his performance in his role and that he continues to 
lead the Board effectively whilst creating an atmosphere of 
Committee members 
There are three main Board Committees: Audit, Nominations and Remuneration. The Committees are provided with sufficient 
resources via the Company Secretary and, where necessary, have direct access to independent professional advisors to 
undertake their duties.

open discussion where challenge and debate is welcomed; 
and 
• The Committees each performed a self-evaluation of their 
obligations on the basis of a detailed questionnaire relating 
to each area of responsibility. No major areas for action were 
identified. 
Following the results of the evaluation, the Board confirms that 
all directors continue to be effective and demonstrate a 
commitment to the role, including having time to attend all 
necessary meetings and to carry out other appropriate duties. 
It was noted that one area for greater emphasis coming out of 
this review was succession planning. At the time of the Merger 
careful consideration was given to what skills were needed to 
best lead the Group during this period of integration. The 
Board was appointed accordingly. With the integration well 
underway, the evaluation found that more emphasis now 
needs to be placed on succession planning for these critical 
board roles.  
Capital and constitutional disclosures 
Information on the Company’s share capital and constitution 
required to be included in this Corporate Governance 
statement are contained on page 45 of this report. Such 
information is incorporated into this Corporate Governance 
statement by reference and is deemed to be part of it.  
Risk and internal controls 
Risk management 
The Group has established a risk management programme 
that assists management to identify, assess and mitigate 
business, financial, operational and compliance risks. The 
Board views risk management as integral to good business 
practice and protecting the best interests of shareholders. 
Executive management of the Group has direct responsibility 
for the risk management programmes of their businesses. The 
Board’s focus is primarily on reviewing the effectiveness of 
these processes, rather than involving itself in the processes 
themselves. Specific controls and processes are detailed 
further below. 
The Group’s risk management framework aims to: 
• assist management to implement effective means of risk 
identification, assessment and mitigation; 
• instil a risk-based approach and awareness into the Group’s 
culture; 
• encourage accountability for identifying and managing the 
risks specific to line managers’ respective areas of the 
business; and 
• create and implement risk management strategies which 
address all types of risks. 
The Group maintains a risk register the principal risks of which 
are set out on pages 16 to 19. Senior managers within the 
business are responsible for managing and monitoring the 
risks identified within their areas, and identifying new risks as 
they arise. Each risk identified is ranked according to a score 
based on the likelihood of an event occurring and its impact  
on the business should it occur due to either failure or absence 
of mitigating controls. Mitigating controls in place are also 
documented. 
Internal control 
As in any business, the Group faces a number of risks and 
uncertainties on a daily basis, and a detailed internal control 
framework exists so as to mitigate these risks and protect the 
interests of shareholders. The directors have overall 
responsibility for the Group’s systems of internal control and 
for reviewing effectiveness, and they discharge this 
responsibility by performing the following: 
• determining the Group’s risk appetite and tolerance; 
• overseeing the risk management strategy; and 
• ensuring that management implements effective systems  
of risk identification, assessment and mitigation. 
The Board delegates to executive management the 
responsibility for designing, operating and monitoring these 
systems. The systems are based on a process of identifying, 
evaluating and managing significant risks and include the risk 
management processes set out above. 
The systems of internal control described in this report were in 
place throughout the period under review and up to the date of 
approval of the annual report and financial statements. The 
effectiveness of these systems is periodically reviewed by the 
Audit Committee in accordance with the Code, and the other 
good practice guidance issued by the FRC in relation to 
internal control. These systems are also refined as necessary 
to meet changes in the Group’s business and associated risks. 
They can only provide reasonable and not absolute assurance 
against material errors, losses, fraud or breaches of laws  
and regulations. 
The Company has conducted an annual review of the 
effectiveness of the systems of risk management and internal 
control in operation during the year and up to the date of the 
approval of the Annual Report and Accounts which was 
approved by the Audit Committee and the Board.  
At each of its meetings the Audit Committee reviewed and 
considered reports on the status of the Group’s risk 
management systems, findings from reviews of internal 
controls and reports on the status of any weaknesses in 
internal controls identified by the internal or external auditors.   Dixons Carphone plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014/15
Corporate Governance
 
43 
Internal audit 
The Group has an internal audit department which conducts 
reviews of selected business processes each year. The internal 
audit programme for 2014/15 consisted of reviews across a 
range of areas documented and prioritised in the Group’s 
internal audit plan, which was prepared and approved with 
input from management and the Audit Committee. The plan is 
designed each year to test the robustness of mitigating 
controls and procedures are designed to identify any areas of 
improvement. Part of the approval process of this plan involves 
the Audit Committee’s consideration of alignment of the plan 
with the principal risks faced by the Group. As such this plan 
was revised and re-presented to the Audit Committee again 
following the Merger to capture the key risks of the  
combined Group. 
The Audit Committee Chairman receives and reviews all 
reports from the internal audit department detailing its material 
findings from testing performed and any recommendations for 
improvement. The Audit Committee receives a summary of 
these reports at each meeting, with the full reports available to 
all members on request. The progress and implementation of 
ensuing action plans are tracked to completion by the internal 
audit department, and follow up procedures performed where 
additional controls have been put in place to ensure that the 
new controls have been implemented effectively.  
The Audit Committee considered the effectiveness of the 
internal audit department through holding discussions with 
management, considering the quality of reports submitted to 
the Committee, the timeliness of the clearance of action points, 
and the perceived impartiality of the audit team itself. The 
Committee concluded that the internal audit department has in 
all respects been effective during the period under review. 
Authorisation of conflicts of interest 
The Company has procedures in place to identify, authorise 
and manage conflicts of interest which have operated 
effectively. Potential conflicts are approved by the Board or 
two independent directors where authorisation is needed 
quickly and then reported to the main Board at its next 
meeting. A register of directors’ conflicts is maintained.  
Communication with investors 
The Board supports the initiatives set out in the Code and  
the Stewardship Code and actively encourages engagement 
with major institutional investors and other stakeholders. It 
believes that it is important to explain business developments 
and financial results to the Company’s shareholders and  
to understand shareholder concerns. The principal 
communication media used to impart information to 
shareholders are news releases (including results 
announcements), investor presentations and  
company publications. 
The Group Chief Executive has lead responsibility for investor 
relations. He is supported by a dedicated investor relations 
department that, amongst other matters, organises 
presentations for analysts and institutional investors. There  
is a full programme of regular dialogue with major institutional 
shareholders and potential shareholders as well as sell-side 
analysts. In all such dialogue, care is taken to ensure that no 
price sensitive information is released.  
The Chairman ensures that the Board receives regular updates 
at Board meetings on investor relations matters. The Board 
also receives periodic reports on investors’ views of the 
performance of the Company. The Chairman and non-
executive directors, are available to meet with major 
shareholders, if such meetings are required and the Chairman 
of the Remuneration Committee communicates with major 
shareholders on matters of remuneration and has conducted 
various remuneration consultations during the period under 
review. For more information on the remuneration 
consultations, please refer to the Remuneration report  
on pages 54 to 74. 
The Company is committed to communication with all of its 
members, whether institutional investors, private or employee 
shareholders. The Company reports formally to its members 
when its full year and half year results are published. These 
results are posted on the investor relations part of the 
corporate website in addition to other external announcements 
and press releases.  
The Company also communicates with shareholders through 
the annual general meeting, at which an account of the 
progress of the business over the last year is given in addition 
to a review of current issues. This also provides the opportunity 
for shareholders to ask questions. The directors, including the 
chairmen of the Audit, Nominations and Remuneration 
Committees attend the annual general meeting. In accordance 
with the Code, formal notification of the Company’s annual 
general meeting is sent to shareholders at least 20 working 
days in advance of the meeting.  
Further financial and business information is available on the 
Group’s corporate website.

in relation to the Merger up to an aggregate nominal amount  
of £576,067.77. 
The directors have no present intention to issue ordinary 
shares, other than pursuant to obligations under employee 
share schemes. This resolution remains valid until the 
conclusion of this year’s Annual General Meeting when  
a resolution will be proposed to renew the authority. 
Authority was given by the shareholders at the 2014 annual 
general meeting to purchase a maximum of 57,606,776 shares, 
such authority remaining valid for 15 months or until the 
conclusion of the Company’s 2015 Annual General Meeting.

renewal of this authority at the forthcoming Annual General 
Meeting but has no current intention to make such purchases.   Dixons Carphone plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014/15

Chairman’s statement 
Introduction 
I present to you the report of the Audit Committee, the first of 
the merged Carphone Warehouse and Dixons Retail. In this 
covering letter I have set out our key areas of activity within  
our overarching objective of ensuring that the systems and 
controls relating to the financial management and reporting  
of Dixons Carphone plc are appropriate. 
The Merger has been a significant undertaking. The activities of 
integration to create the new organisation have had a major 
bearing on our work. We have focused on ensuring that, 
notwithstanding the significant change that has been taking 
place, the Group has the appropriate internal control and risk 
management systems in place to satisfy the financial reporting 
and management requirements. We are grateful to our financial 
management and internal and external auditors for the 
unstinting efforts they have made in this regard. 
Merger and induction 
All members of the Audit Committee were previously members 
of the Carphone Warehouse or Dixons Retail audit committees. 
We have therefore had the benefit of significant experience of 
the legacy businesses. 
We recognised that we needed to inform the committee 
members about the entire merged group so embarked upon 
an early induction process. This involved sharing papers on 
key judgements and significant accounting policies in the 
legacy businesses; arranging briefings with management on 
topics relating to ‘the other side’; and participating in broader 
induction activities on strategy, store visits and the like. Each 
committee member was encouraged to request any further 
induction information that they required. 
Key activities 
In addition to assimilating the various sources of information on 
the Group, the Audit Committee’s work included the following:  
• considered reports by management on how the financial 
organisation would be structured and how the financial 
reporting would be prepared in the short and longer term; 
• debated the accounting and financial reporting for the 
Merger, receiving reports from financial management and 
the external auditor to support the conclusions reached; 
• approved the formation of the merged internal audit group 
and the plan of work; 
• requested and considered a review by internal audit, 
supported by the appropriate commercial management,  
on the supplier rebate terms and processes across the 
Group; the review concluded that the accounting being 
adopted is satisfactory; 
• received presentations from management on topics from  
the risk agenda including IT strategy (including security and 
control) and HR; and 
• considered the various corporate transactions that have 
taken place in addition to the Merger, the accounting for 
these and overall that the financial reporting for the Group  
is fair, balanced and understandable. 
Looking ahead 
It has been a busy year for the Group with much of the 
financial reporting priority being on the Merger itself and the 
need to maintain a controlled environment across the legacy 
businesses.  
The Group’s activity will now turn to building the longer term 
systems, processes and organisation as well as conforming 
with the new requirements of the 2014 UK Corporate 
Governance Code and the FRC Guidance on Risk 
Management, Internal Control and Related Financial and 
Business Reporting. This will include adopting the longer term 
viability statement for the first time. The development of the IT 
strategy and control framework will remain an area of focus for 
the committee in the year ahead. 
I will be in attendance at the Annual General Meeting and will 
be available to talk to you then. In the meantime if you have 
any questions please do get in touch.

Audit Committee report

The Board is satisfied that the Chairman of the Committee, a 
member of the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Scotland, 
meets the requirement for recent and relevant financial 
experience. The Company Secretary acts as Secretary to the 
Committee and attends all meetings. The Committee’s 
deliberations are reported by its Chairman to the following 
Board meeting and the minutes of each meeting are circulated 
to all members of the Board following approval.  
At each meeting there may be a discussion between the 
Committee members and the external auditor without the 
presence of management in order to allow discussion of 
private matters which the auditor may wish to raise. 
Occasionally a discussion may be held between Committee 
members, the external auditor and the Group Director of 
Internal Audit if appropriate.  
In undertaking its duties the Committee has access to the 
services of the Group Finance Director, his team and the 
Company Secretary, as well as external professional advice  
as necessary. In addition the Chairman meets with the  
external auditor outside of formal meetings and without 
management present. 
External advice 
The Board makes funds available to the Committee to enable it 
to take independent legal, accounting or other advice when the 
Committee believes it necessary to do so. 
Responsibilities 
The Committee assists the Board to fulfil its oversight 
responsibilities by acting independently from the executive 
directors. There is an annual schedule of items which are 
shared across the meetings during the year to ensure the 
Committee covers fully those items within its terms of 
reference. These items are supplemented throughout the year 
as key matters arise.  
The Committee has the following principal duties: 
• monitoring the integrity of the half year and full year financial 
statements and any formal announcements relating to the 
Group’s financial performance; 
• review the results and conclusions of work performed by the 
external auditor; 
• advising the Board on whether, as a whole, the Annual 
Report and Accounts is fair, balanced and understandable; 
• reviewing significant financial reporting judgements; 
• reviewing the Group’s financial controls and internal control 
and risk management systems; 
• monitoring and reviewing the effectiveness of the 
Company’s internal audit function; 
• making recommendations to the Board in relation to the 
appointment of the external auditor; 
• reviewing and monitoring the relationship with the external 
auditors, including their independence, objectivity, 
effectiveness, remuneration and terms of engagement; 
• considering whistleblowing arrangements by which 
employees may raise concerns about possible improprieties 
in matters of financial reporting or other matters; 
• any specific topics as defined by the Board; and 
• referring matters to the Board which, in its opinion, should 
be addressed at a meeting of the Board. 
The terms of reference of the Audit Committee are reviewed 
annually by the Board and are available on the Group’s 
corporate website (www.dixonscarphone.com). 
Key matters considered during the year 
Accounting and financial reporting matters  
The Committee is responsible for monitoring the integrity of the 
half year and annual financial statements in conjunction with 
both senior management and the external auditor. Following 
the Merger, management presented the Committee with the 
accounting policies and practices of both legacy businesses. 
These were then debated and a combined set of policies and 
practices agreed with no significant adjustments required in 
respect of either business. During the period ended 2 May 
2015 consideration was given to the following matters: 
• the suitability of the Group’s accounting policies and 
practices; 
Members 
In compliance with the Code, the Committee comprises 
exclusively non-executive directors, who, along with their 
attendance at scheduled meetings, are set out in the table 
below.  
Meetings 
The Committee met three scheduled times with one 
additional ad-hoc meeting called during the period. Since 
the year end there have been two further Committee 
meetings. All eligible members attended each of the 
meetings during which they were a member of the 
Committee, except as outlined below. The Group Chief 
Executive, Group Finance Director, Group Director of 
Internal Audit, other senior management and 
representatives of the Company’s external auditor (Deloitte 
LLP) attended the Audit Committee meetings by invitation.

• compliance with financial reporting and governance 
standards; 
• areas where significant levels of judgement have been 
applied or items which have been discussed with the 
external auditor; 
• updated accounting and corporate governance regulations; 
and 
• whether the Annual Report and Accounts, taken as a whole, 
is fair, balanced and understandable and provides sufficient 
information necessary for shareholders and other users of 
the accounts to assess the Group’s performance, business 
model and strategy. To assist with discharging these 
responsibilities, the Committee considers documents 
prepared by management and reports received from the 
external auditor on the outcomes of their annual and half 
year audit procedures.  
 
The Committee received reports and recommendations from management and the external auditor setting out the significant 
accounting issues and judgements applicable to the following key areas. These were discussed and challenged, where 
appropriate, by the Committee. Following debate, the Committee concurred with management’s conclusions: 
Matters of significance and  
areas of judgement How the issue was addressed by the Committee 
Revenue recognition Revenue recognition is considered to be a critical accounting policy and the judgements are set out in 
note 1 u) of the Group financial statements. Key components of judgement are in relation to the 
recognition of network commission receivable and also in relation to customer support agreements.  
The Committee reviewed management’s assessment of these policies with reference to contractual 
terms, the Group’s historical experience of customer behaviour and information received from third 
parties as well as historical claims data in respect of customer support agreements. 
Accounting for the Merger The Committee discussed, challenged and assessed the assumptions made in relation to valuing the 
assets and liabilities acquired as part of the Merger which concluded in net liabilities acquired of  
£647 million. In addition, the Committee reviewed the consideration for the Merger transaction and the 
allocation of goodwill between the different Cash Generated Units acquired.  
This valuation exercise included external as well as internal valuations which incorporated management 
judgement. The Committee reviewed and, where relevant, challenged the methodologies used in 
calculating the fair values which have been recognised as set out in note 23 to the Group financial 
statements. 
Disposal accounting The Committee reviewed the judgements taken in the calculation of gains and losses made in respect of 
the disposal transactions of Virgin Mobile France as well as the operations in Germany, the Netherlands 
and Portugal. The Committee also assessed the appropriateness of their treatment as assets held for 
sale then further as discontinued operations as concluded by management, as set out in note 24 to the 
Group financial statements.  
Supplier funding A number of arrangements exist relating to supplier funding across the Group, including promotional 
support and volume rebates. This topic received increased focus by management which culminated in  
a presentation to the Committee from the Group Director of Internal Audit. Additional testing in this area  
was also carried out by the external auditor. The Committee challenged and debated with management  
its approach to supplier funding and its recognition and accounting treatment and no major issues were 
noted. Further information in relation to supplier funding can be found in note 1 u) to the Group financial 
statements. 
Inventory provisioning Inventory is a significant balance for the Group, as set out in note 12 to the Group financial statements 
and contains managerial judgement for such items as obsolescence and shrinkage. As part of the 
general committee procedures managerial judgement was assessed and no major issues noted. 
Impairment testing of goodwill and 
intangible assets 
Significant goodwill and acquisition intangibles were recognised as part of the accounting for the Merger 
which comprised goodwill of £2,629 million and acquisition intangibles of £373 million. The Committee 
considered the judgements which had been made in relation to the values held in the balance sheet, in 
addition to the methodology used in assessing the supportability of the year end goodwill balance and 
assessing for any potential impairment. A sensitivity analysis was then reviewed regarding the impact  
of a reasonably possible change in the key assumptions. These assumptions are set out in note 9 to the 
Group financial statements.

Matters of significance and  
areas of judgement How the issue was addressed by the Committee 
Fair, balanced and understandable  As part of this assessment, as well as evaluating the narrative reporting attributable to the Headline 
results and financial position of the Group, the Committee reviewed the key judgement concerning the 
classification of items between Headline and Non-Headline, including consideration of the £89 million 
pre-tax Non-Headline charges. This assessment considered whether items fell within the Group’s 
definition of Non-Headline as well as the consistency of treatment of such items year on year.  
This assessment was central to the Committee’s consideration of the integrity and sufficiency of 
information disclosed in the Annual Report and Accounts along with other salient matters to ensure that, 
taken as a whole, it is fair, balanced and understandable and explains the Group’s performance, 
business model and strategy. This included an assessment of narrative reporting to ensure consistency 
with the financial reporting section. 
Taxation The Group operates across multiple tax jurisdictions. The complex nature of tax legislation in certain 
jurisdictions can necessitate the use of judgement. In addition, management also uses assumptions and 
judgements to assess the likelihood of utilisation of available tax losses.  
The Committee also reviewed judgements and assumptions concerning any significant provisions, 
including progress made on matters being discussed with tax authorities and where applicable advice 
provided by external advisors. 
Going concern The Committee was presented with an assessment of the Group’s future cash forecasts and profit 
projections, available facilities, facility headroom, banking covenants and the results of a sensitivity 
analysis performed, including having regard to the current uncertainties in the Greek economy. The 
Committee discussed this with management in addition to management’s analysis which was performed 
with reference to budgeted revenue and earnings levels for the coming years. The Committee was 
satisfied that the going concern basis of preparation continues to be appropriate for the Group. 
 
Internal control and risk management 
The Committee is responsible for reviewing the Group’s 
internal control and risk management systems. In order to 
discharge its responsibilities in this area, in addition to its other 
responsibilities, the Committee reviewed the following key 
items: 
• the annual Audit Committee agenda; 
• common control themes identified throughout the business, 
including key management dependencies. Where this was 
identified subsequent action has been taken to minimise  
the risk; 
• the assessment of the Group’s response to information 
security and data protection risks; 
• the combined Group’s responsibilities relating to those 
aspects of the Group that are regulated; 
• the financial controls framework and its subsequent 
assessment by internal audit; and 
• the new governance and risk management framework put  
in place throughout the merged Group. 
Internal audit  
The Committee is also responsible for monitoring and 
reviewing the effectiveness of its internal audit function. During 
the period the following significant risk areas of the business 
were included within internal audit reviews:  
• information security and data protection; 
• IT governance and IT risk management; and  
• business continuity.  
 
In addition, as part of a three year rolling programme, audits 
were performed over the following financial processes to 
provide assurance to the Audit Committee that controls were 
operating within these areas:  
• supplier funding;  
• payroll;  
• procurement and purchase to pay. 
In addition to considering any significant issues arising from 
the results of the audits shown above, the Committee also 
formally reviewed the effectiveness of internal audit and the 
adequacy of its resources. 
External audit  
The external auditor is appointed by shareholders to provide 
an opinion on the financial statements and certain disclosures 
prepared by Group management. Deloitte LLP acted as the 
external auditor to the Group throughout the year. The 
Committee is responsible for oversight of the external auditor, 
including approving the annual audit plan and all associated 
audit fees. 
The key matters in relation to external audit that were 
considered by the Committee were: 
• the annual audit plan; 
• the annual audit fee and fees for non-audit services which 
are set out in note 3 to the Group financial statements, with 
due regard to the balance between audit and non-audit fees  
and the policy for approval of non-audit fees paid to the 
Group’s auditor; 
 
   Dixons Carphone plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014/15
Corporate Governance
 
51 
• the effectiveness of the external auditor. Feedback on the 
effectiveness of the audit process in addressing areas of  
key audit risk was obtained from members of the Audit 
Committee and regular attendees, members of the finance 
team and senior management within the businesses via a 
specifically designed questionnaire. The responses were 
then considered by the Committee in conjunction with the 
outputs received and responsiveness of the auditor during 
the audit process. The results showed a positive view of the 
audit process and of Deloitte as the external auditor, 
specifically in relation to the high quality and integrity of the 
team, the constructive relationship and effectiveness of the 
communication. Following due consideration the Committee 
continues to be satisfied with the quality and effectiveness  
of the audit; and 
• significant issues and areas of judgement arising from 
reports from the external auditor, which in addition to those 
matters referred to above, included IT controls and risks. 
These areas were set out in the reports from the external 
auditor and were discussed with the Committee. The 
Committee concluded that the judgements taken and 
assumptions made were all fair and reasonable. 
Provision of non-audit services provided by the 
external auditor 
The Committee has a formal policy on auditor independence 
which specifies the types of work from which the external 
auditor is excluded and those which the auditor may perform. 
In July 2015 the Audit Committee approved a change to this 
policy, further restricting non-audit services, so that after a 
short transitional period the only services permitted by the 
external auditor will be audit services and certain other audit 
related services (primarily those related to the role of reporting 
accountant and or audit reports on financial information 
provided by the Group). All non-audit fee proposals are subject 
to pre-approval and must be submitted to the Group Financial 
Controller. Where assignments are expected to generate fees 
of over £100,000, approval must be obtained from the Audit 
Committee in advance. 
During the period under review, the non-audit services 
performed by the external auditor primarily related to activities 
in relation to the Merger, assignments which were closely 
related to the annual audit or work of such a nature that a 
detailed understanding of the Group was necessary. The Audit 
Committee reviewed the services performed by the external 
auditor during the year and are satisfied that these services did 
not prejudice the external auditor’s independence and that it 
was appropriate for them to perform these services.  
The level of non-audit fees paid to the external auditor, which 
was approved by the Committee is set out in note 3 to the 
Group financial statements and amounted to £1.9 million 
compared to £2.0 million of audit fees. Excluding the effect of 
acting as reporting accountants for the Merger, the proportion 
of non-audit fees vs audit fees was 28%. 
Due to the change in the auditor independence policy  
detailed above, and following the completion of the Merger, 
non-audit fees incurred by the Group are expected to reduce  
in the future.  
Consideration of auditor appointment and independence 
On an ongoing basis the Committee considers the 
appropriateness of the re-appointment of the external auditor, 
including rotation of the audit partner. Deloitte LLP has been 
the external auditor since the Group’s formation in 2010 
(following the demerger of TalkTalk Group). Deloitte LLP was 
also the external auditor of Dixons Retail. The current lead 
audit partner has been in place for four years (partner rotation 
is required on a five yearly basis).  
The Committee will continue to consider the requirements  
of the Code and also the recent Competition & Markets 
Authority’s Final Order which is now designed to align with the 
new European Union Regulation 547/2014 (which allows 
companies greater flexibility) on audit tendering and rotation 
timings. Under current guidance Deloitte can continue to be 
reappointed for year ends beginning before June 2023, at 
which point we would be required to change. A tender process 
would then be undertaken and a proposal made accordingly. 
In addition to this, the Group will consider retendering the 
external audit at each partner rotation. 
In light of the assessments and review undertaken, the Audit 
Committee recommended to the Board that Deloitte LLP be 
retained as auditors of the Company. This recommendation 
was endorsed by the Board.

Chairman’s overview 
The Nominations Committee has an important role in the 
Dixons Carphone plc structure, evaluating the skills required to 
lead the business effectively and ensuring the right talent and 
experience is available. In order to ensure continuity of purpose 
and effective leadership it is important to ensure succession 
planning obligations are met. Since the Merger the Committee 
has met once to perform a thorough review of the balance of 
the Board and its Committees and other governance 
obligations.  
At Merger a thorough review of the Board structure and 
membership was performed. Also at the year end the 
Committee performed a further review of the skills required to 
successfully lead the Company and matched those skills to the 
current Board membership. No further need for appointments 
were identified other than an appointment of a Senior 
Independent Director. More about this process is shown below 
along with further details on the Nominations Committee and 
its position in the Company’s governance framework.

Succession planning 
At the time of the Merger consideration was given to creating  
a talented board with appropriate experience and expertise  
to lead the Company in its strategy. The Board has been 
successful in coming together but over the next year or so 
emphasis will be placed on ensuring that a full succession 
planning exercise is performed to ensure continuity.  
Diversity 
The Board recognises the importance of diversity, including 
but not limited to gender, in achieving the right mix of skills, 
knowledge and experience in order to help the organisation 
reach its potential. Currently 23% of the Board and 25% of  
the Group Executive team are female.  
The Board does not set out a target on gender balance as it 
believes that candidates should be appointed on merit. The 
Board will take opportunities to increase diversity as suitable 
candidates present themselves. For more information on 
employee diversity see page 29. 
In performing its annual review the Board also looks at other 
aspects of diversity relevant to the Group. For example, with  
a large proportion of the business in the Nordics, we have a 
Swedish non-executive director on the Board to provide 
knowledge of these international markets. 
Re-election 
All directors will present themselves for election or re-election 
at the Annual General Meeting. Each of the directors are being 
unanimously recommended by the other members of the 
Board due to their experience, knowledge and wider 
management and industry experience, continued effectiveness 
and commitment to their role.

Chairman’s statement 
The period since we last reported has seen significant change 
especially in relation to the Merger. The Prospectus and 
Circular have already set out details in respect of the existing 
incentive schemes of Carphone Warehouse Group plc and 
Dixons Retail plc and how these were impacted by the Merger. 
This Remuneration report sets out the Group’s proposed future 
Remuneration policy of the new combined Company which is 
broadly in line with the Remuneration policy approved by 
shareholders in 2014.  
We have used the opportunity of the Merger to review our 
approach to remuneration to ensure it is aligned to our 
strategic direction, appropriate for a FTSE 100 company and 
focused on driving superior shareholder returns. 
After careful consideration we have decided to continue to 
align our executive pay structure for the combined Group to a 
more leveraged approach focused on creating shareholder 
value. This is reflected in our long term incentive plans (LTIPs) 
and our shareholding policy, which was strengthened to 
require executive directors to hold 200% of their base salary  
in the Company’s shares. 
We have also maintained our approach of providing a strong 
link between our levels of annual bonus with the performance 
and delivery of our strategic priorities. When setting targets for 
our annual bonus and our LTIPs, we start with the strategy of 
the business and the behaviours we want to encourage and 
design metrics around them. In order to keep overall 
remuneration weighted towards variable pay that incentivises 
outperformance we are providing a modest level of benefits. 
In order to harmonise we have had to adjust some elements of 
pay for all executive directors, such as reducing the annual 
bonus which existed previously within Carphone from 200% of 
base salary to 125% and reducing pension contributions for 
the former Dixons executive directors from 20% to 10%. 
At the time of the Merger we gained, by special resolution, 
shareholder agreement to make adjustments to existing 
awards and grant additional awards under our long term 
incentive plans. This was to ensure the existing participants 
were no better or worse off following the Merger and to make 
awards to the new executive directors and other senior 
leaders. These plans align the interests of our management 
with our shareholders, providing the opportunity for them to 
earn significant value but only if superior shareholder returns 
are delivered.  
We have also responded to the feedback received on the 
policy during 2014 and have excluded the executive directors 
from being eligible to participate in the mid term incentive plan 
introduced following the Merger. 
Although no substantial changes have been made to the 
remuneration policy following the Merger, we have taken the 
opportunity to make some administrative changes, such as 
updating the provisions in our LTIPs to include the ability for 
the Remuneration Committee to apply malus and clawback 
conditions in certain specified circumstances. 
Due to the changes made to the components of the 
remuneration packages of the executive directors at the time  
of the Merger, no further changes are proposed to base 
salaries as part of the annual pay review process this year. 
Bonus payments this year will reflect the positive business 
performance and will be paid at 125% of base salary. No  
LTIPs vested during the year for executive directors serving  
on the Board. 
We are also acutely aware that our success is largely down to 
the dedication and hard work of all our employees and that it is 
vital that they continue to feel fairly and appropriately rewarded 
and that they are able to share in the success of the business. 
We are therefore very pleased this year to have been able to 
launch a combined Dixons Carphone plc Sharesave plan for  
all UK and Ireland employees, which has enjoyed a take-up 
rate of approximately 20% of the combined UK and  
Ireland workforce. 
The proposed Remuneration policy set out in this Annual 
Report and Accounts will be put to shareholders for approval in 
a binding vote at the Annual General Meeting on 10 September 
2015 where they will be asked to approve the policy for a 
period of three years.

Introduction 
The purpose of these reports is to inform shareholders of the 
Company’s directors’ remuneration for the period ended 2 May 
2015 and the Remuneration policy for subsequent years. This 
report is divided into two sections: 
• the Remuneration Policy report; and 
• the Annual Remuneration report  
The remuneration policy set out will be put to shareholders  
for approval in a binding vote at the Annual General Meeting on 
10 September 2015 and the policy will be effective from that 
date. Shareholders will be asked to approve the policy for a 
period of three years starting from the effective date. The 
Annual Remuneration report will also be put to an advisory 
vote at the Annual General Meeting. 
The role of the Remuneration Committee (the Committee) is to 
determine on behalf of the Board a remuneration policy for 
executive directors and senior management in order to attract 
and retain executives who have the ability, experience and 
dedication to deliver outstanding returns for our shareholders.  
The Committee has adopted the principles of good 
governance relating to directors’ remuneration as enshrined in 
section D of the Code and has complied with those principles 
in the year under review unless otherwise noted. 
These reports have been prepared by the Committee on behalf 
of the Board in accordance with the Companies Act 2006, 
Schedule 8 to the Large and Medium-sized Companies and 
Groups (Accounts and Reports) Regulations 2008 (as 
amended) and the Listing Rules of the Financial Conduct 
Authority. The Remuneration Policy report (which is not subject 
to audit) details the role of the Committee, the principles of 
remuneration and other matters. The Annual Remuneration 
report (elements of which are audited) details the directors’ and 
former directors’ fixed and variable pay, share awards, share 
options and pension arrangements.

Remuneration Committee objectives 
The Board has delegated to the Committee responsibility for 
determining policy in relation to the remuneration packages  
for executive directors and other senior management. This 
delegation includes their terms and conditions of employment 
in addition to the operation of the Group’s share based 
employee incentive schemes. The Committee has clearly 
defined terms of reference which are available on the 
Company’s corporate website. 
Remuneration strategy 
Put simply, our aim is to generate superior returns for our 
shareholders and the key to achieving this is our people. Our 
remuneration strategy is therefore designed to motivate high 
performing people to deliver our business strategy. 
The objectives of our Remuneration strategy are to:  
• attract, motivate and retain high quality talent; 
• be transparent and align the interests of senior management 
and executive directors with shareholders, by encouraging 
management to have a significant personal stake in the long 
term success of the business; 
• weight remuneration to variable pay that incentivises 
outperformance over the short and long term whilst 
discouraging inappropriate risk taking; 
• ensure that superior rewards are only paid for exceptional 
performance against challenging targets; 
• apply policies consistently across the Group to promote 
alignment and teamwork; 
• recognise the importance of delivering across a balanced set 
of metrics to ensure the right behaviours are adopted and 
the long term health of the business is protected; and 
• avoid rewarding failure. 
In developing its policy the Committee has regard to: 
• the performance, roles and responsibilities of each executive 
director or member of senior management; 
• arrangements which apply below senior management levels, 
including average base salary increases; 
• information and surveys from internal and independent 
sources;  
• the economic environment and financial performance of the 
Company; and 
• corporate governance good practice. 
Guidelines on responsible investment disclosure 
In line with the Investment Association Guidelines on 
responsible investment disclosure, the Committee is satisfied 
that the incentive structure and targets for executive directors 
do not raise any environmental, social or governance risks by 
inadvertently motivating irresponsible or reckless behaviour. 
The Committee considers that no element of the remuneration 
package will encourage inappropriate risk taking by any 
member of senior management.

Remuneration policy table 
The individual elements of the remuneration packages offered to executive directors are summarised in the following table: 
Base Salary (fixed pay) 
• Purpose and link to strategy To aid the recruitment, retention and motivation of high-performing people. 
To reflect their experience and importance to the business. 
• Operation Reviewed annually.
The review reflects a range of factors including merit levels, internal relativity and cost. 
Our overall policy, having due regard to the factors noted, is normally to target salaries 
up to the median level. 
Salaries for new appointments as executive directors will be set in accordance with the 
Recruitment Policy set out on page 63 of this Remuneration Policy report. 
The Committee takes into consideration the impact of base salary increases on the 
package as a whole, as bonuses as well as some other elements of pay (such as 
pension contributions) are generally worked out based on a percentage of salary. 
• Maximum opportunity Ordinarily, increases for executive directors will be in line with increases across the 
Group. Increases beyond those granted across the Group may be awarded in certain 
circumstances such as changes in responsibilities, progression in the role and significant 
increases in the size, complexity or value of the Group. 
Salary levels for current directors are shown in the Annual Remuneration report. 
• Performance assessment / targets Salaries are reviewed annually by the Committee at the appropriate meeting having due 
regard to the individual’s experience, performance and added value to the business. 
Benefits (fixed pay) 
• Purpose and link to strategy In line with the Company’s strategy to keep remuneration weighted to variable pay that 
incentivises outperformance, a modest range of benefits is provided. 
Benefits may vary based on the personal choices of the director. 
Provision of relocation or other related assistance may be provided to support the 
appointment or relocation of a director. 
• Operation Executive directors are entitled to a combination of benefits which include, but are not 
limited to:  
• car allowance; 
• private medical cover; 
• long term incapacity cover; 
• life assurance; 
• holiday and sick pay; and 
• a range of voluntary benefits including the purchase of additional holidays. 
Should an executive director be recruited from or be based in a non-UK location, 
benefits may be determined by those typically provided in the normal country of 
residence. 
Relocation or other related assistance could include, but is not limited to, removal and 
other relocation costs, tax equalisation, tax advice and accommodation costs. 
• Maximum opportunity The cost to the Group of providing such benefits will vary from year to year in 
accordance with the cost of providing such benefits, which is kept under regular review. 
• Performance assessment / targets Not applicable.

Pension (fixed pay) 
• Purpose and link to strategy A pension is provided which is consistent with that provided to managers across the 
Group and in line with our strategy to keep remuneration weighted to variable pay that 
incentivises outperformance. 
• Operation Defined contribution plans are offered to all employees. A defined benefit pension plan 
continues in operation for Dixons’ longer serving employees, which is now closed to 
new participants and future accrual. 
Executive directors may choose to receive a cash allowance in lieu of pension 
contributions. 
• Maximum opportunity Company pension contribution of up to 10% of base salary, which can be taken in 
whole or in part as a cash allowance in lieu of pension. However a greater contribution of 
up to 20% may be made where necessary to recruit or retain an executive director. 
• Performance assessment / targets Not applicable.
Annual performance bonus (variable pay) 
• Purpose and link to strategy Annual performance bonuses are in place to incentivise the delivery of stretching, near
term business targets based on our business strategy.  
These bonuses provide a strong link between reward and performance and drive the 
creation of further shareholder value. 
The principles and approach are consistently applied across the Group ensuring 
alignment to a common vision and strategy. 
They are based on a balanced approach ensuring appropriate behaviours are adopted 
and encouraging a longer term focus. 
• Operation Bonus payments are determined after the year end and subject to a minimum profit 
threshold being achieved before payment is due. 
For threshold level of performance a bonus of 25% of base salary is payable. A sliding 
scale determines payment between the minimum and maximum bonus payable. 
The annual bonus is typically paid in July / August in cash and is non-pensionable, 
based on the audited performance over the previous financial year. 
The annual bonus can instead be settled in shares or a mixture of cash and shares 
which could be deferred, at the discretion of the Remuneration Committee. 
Performance is reviewed by the Committee using its judgement where necessary to 
assess the achievement of targets. The Committee retains the discretion to adjust 
downwards bonus payments where achievement of targets would result in a payment  
of a bonus at a level which would not be consistent with the interests of the Company 
and its shareholders. 
Clawback and malus provisions apply for material misstatement, misconduct and 
reputational damage enabling performance adjustments and / or recovery of sums 
already paid. 
• Maximum opportunity Maximum annual bonus potential for all executive directors is 125% of base salary. 
No bonus is payable if the minimum profit threshold is not achieved. 
• Performance assessment / targets All measures and targets are reviewed and set by the Committee at the beginning of 
the financial year with a view to supporting the achievement of the Group strategy. 
The bonus scheme has targets based on a balanced scorecard. The balanced 
scorecard may include both financial and non-financial measures, such as employee, 
customer and strategic measures. The weighting of measures will be determined by the 
Committee each year. Financial measures (such as profit and cash) will represent the 
majority of the bonus, with other measures representing the balance.

Long term incentive schemes (variable pay): Share Plan 
• Purpose and link to strategy Long term incentive schemes are transparent and demonstrably aligned with the 
interests of shareholders over the long term. 
The Share Plan is designed to reward and retain executives over the longer term whilst 
aligning an individual’s interests with those of shareholders and in turn delivering 
significant shareholder value. 
• Operation The executive directors participate in the Dixons Carphone (formerly Carphone 
Warehouse Group plc) Share Plan approved by Carphone Warehouse shareholders.  
The intention is to use this plan for the most senior management of the Company. 
New executive directors appointed from time to time may participate in the Dixons 
Carphone Share Plan or the Share Option Plan described on page 59. 
Participants acquire at market value participation shares in a subsidiary company that 
holds the Company’s interests in the Group’s main operating businesses. The Group 
grants loans to participants at a commercial rate of interest to acquire the shares.  
Loans are ordinarily repayable in full if performance conditions are met.  
The performance of the plan will ordinarily be measured at the end of the performance 
period (in or around July 2017 for the current participants), when 60% of the shares vest, 
with 40% deferred for a further year. When the awards vest, the value of the shares held 
by participants will be based on the incremental value (if any) of Dixons Carphone plc in 
excess of the opening valuation together with the minimum return on invested capital. 
These shares will then be purchased by the Company for cash and / or the Company’s 
ordinary shares. 
A ‘bad leaver’ will be required to transfer the participation shares to such party as the 
Company designates for an amount equal to the total amount outstanding under the 
loan (and any accrued interest). If the market value of the shares is less than the amount 
of the outstanding loan (and any accrued interest) then the participant may be required 
to repay up to 20% of the shortfall out of their own resources. 
A participant shall only be a ‘good leaver’ at the sole discretion of the Committee  
and may be permitted to retain an award notwithstanding the termination of their 
employment.  
The Committee has the ability to apply malus and clawback provisions to any awards 
made after March 2015. 
The mechanics of the plan may be varied by the Committee if necessary to ensure that 
participants are neither advantaged nor disadvantaged by a variation of the share capital 
of the Company, bona fide merger, reconstruction or similar reorganisation.  
Further details on the operation of the Share Plan following the Merger are provided  
in note (1) below this policy table. 
• Maximum opportunity The total pool for distribution to participants is subject to a cap of 4% of the total issued 
share capital of the Company on the measurement date. 
Under the Share Plan there are now two pools, one for the original grant in December 
2013 and one for the second grant in September 2014, each being subject to a cap of 
2% of the total issued share capital of the Company. 
The allocation for the Group Chief Executive is 11% of the pool created by the second 
set of awards. 
The allocations for other executive directors are set out in the Annual Remuneration 
report. 
• Performance assessment / targets The Share Plan is designed to share 10% of the incremental value created in Dixons 
Carphone in excess of an opening valuation (assessed over an appropriate period) and 
beyond an annual rate of return of 7% on invested capital. The plan is also underpinned 
by a minimum annual compound TSR growth of 5% and outperformance of the median 
TSR of the FTSE 250.

Long term incentive schemes (variable pay): Share Option Plan 
• Purpose and link to strategy Long term incentive schemes are transparent and demonstrably aligned with the 
interests of shareholders over the long term. 
The Share Option Plan is designed to reward and retain executives over the longer term 
whilst aligning an individual’s interests with those of shareholders and in turn delivering 
significant shareholder value. 
• Operation Discretionary awards of either nil-priced or market priced options are granted over 
Dixons Carphone plc shares. Approved options may be granted subject to HMRC limits. 
The current strategy is to grant a single award of share options with phased vesting 
rather than annual grants, but the Committee reserves the right to change this approach. 
The level of vesting is dependent on achievement of performance targets, usually over  
a three year period from the date of grant. 
Awards do not vest until the third anniversary of the date of grant and may have a 
deferral element. 
The Committee has applied malus and clawback provisions to awards made after 
March 2015. 
If employment ceases during the vesting period, awards will ordinarily lapse in full, 
unless the Committee exercises its discretion. 
No executive director currently holds any interest in the share option plan.  
There is currently no intention to grant any options under this plan to executive directors 
whilst they participate in the Share Plan, but the share option plan may be used for 
recruitment purposes for any executive directors should this be necessary or desirable. 
• Maximum opportunity Grants under the Dixons Carphone Share Option Plan are subject to overall  
dilution limits. 
The maximum grant per participant in any financial year is a market value of 200% of 
base salary. However in exceptional circumstances an award of up to 300% of salary 
may be granted. 
• Performance assessment / targets Performance targets are reviewed by the Committee prior to each grant. 
The Committee determines the targets from a range of measures, including but not 
limited to absolute TSR and TSR relative to an appropriate comparator group. 
The current metrics in use are a combination of absolute TSR performance and relative 
TSR performance against either the FTSE 250 or the FTSE 350. 
All Employee Share Plans including SAYE 
• Purpose and link to strategy Encourages employees to make a long term investment in the Company’s shares and 
therefore be aligned to the long term success of the Company. 
• Operation Executive directors are eligible to participate in any all employee share plans operated 
by the Company which have been approved by shareholders. 
A new grant under the Dixons Carphone HMRC approved SAYE scheme was made  
in the UK and Ireland in February 2015. 
• Maximum opportunity Participants can save up to £500 per month for either three or five years, and in return 
receive a share option granted at up to 20% discount to the market price at the time of 
the invitation.  
The Committee reserves the right to increase this savings limit for future schemes in 
accordance with the statutory limits in place from time to time. 
• Performance assessment / targets The performance of the scheme will be determined by the share price of the Company 
at the end of the relevant savings period.

Share ownership guidelines 
• Purpose and link to strategy Provides close alignment between the longer term interests of executive directors and 
shareholders in terms of the Company’s growth and performance. 
• Operation The Company requires executive directors to retain a certain percentage of base salary 
in the Company’s shares. Directors have a five year period to reach these limits. 
The shares which count towards this requirement are unfettered, beneficially owned 
shares only. 
• Maximum opportunity Not applicable.
• Performance assessment / targets The Company requires all executive directors to retain 200% of base salary in the 
Company’s shares. 
Non-Executive Directors and Chairman / Deputy Chairman fees. 
• Purpose and link to strategy To provide a competitive fee for the performance of non-executive director duties, 
sufficient to attract high calibre individuals to the role. 
• Operation The fees are set to align with the duties undertaken, taking into account market rates, 
and are reviewed on an annual basis. Factors taken into consideration include the 
required time commitment and specific experience. 
Additional fees are payable for acting as Chair of any Board committee, or for acting as 
the Senior Independent Director. 
Non-executive directors do not participate in the annual performance bonus or the long 
term incentive plans, however, a historical arrangement exists for Roger Taylor who 
continues to receive private medical insurance. 
• Maximum opportunity Aggregate annual limit of £2,000,000 imposed by the Articles of Association for 
directors’ fees (not including fees in relation to any executive office or Chairman, 
Committee Chair or Senior Independent Director fees). 
• Performance assessment / targets Not applicable.
 
Notes: 
(1) Long term incentives - Share Plan: The first awards under the Share Plan were made in December 2013 and further awards were made in 
September 2014 after the Merger. At the same time adjustments were made to the first awards to ensure participants were no better or 
worse off as a result of the Merger. The two sets of awards have different opening valuations reflecting the value of the Company at 
appropriate times prior to the grants. Each set of awards has its own pool, which are each subject to a cap of 2% of the total issued share 
capital of Dixons Carphone. The total pool for distribution to all of the participants remains subject to an overall cap of 4% of the total issued 
share capital of the Company on the measurement date.  
 
 There are no plans to issue further awards under this Share Plan until such time as these awards vest when the Committee will review the 
programme of long term incentives for the Group. 
 
(2) The following changes have been made to the Remuneration Policy in order to align the pay of executive directors following the Merger and 
to reflect the remuneration strategy of the new combined Group: 
• reducing the annual bonus which existed previously within Carphone from a maximum of 200% of base salary to 125% of base salary; 
• reducing the pension contributions for the Dixons executive directors from 20% to 10% of base salary; 
• strengthening our shareholding policy to require executive directors to hold 200% of their base salary in the Company’s shares; 
• excluding the executive directors from being eligible to participate in the mid term incentive plan introduced following the Merger; and 
• including the ability for the Remuneration Committee to apply malus and clawback conditions in certain specified circumstances.

Illustration of remuneration policy  
The remuneration policy scenario chart below illustrates the level and mix of potential total remuneration the current executive 
directors could receive under the remuneration policy at four levels of performance including an annualised potential payout for 
the Share Plan. As described in the policy table above, our long term incentive arrangements are designed to align executives’ 
interests with those of shareholders and incentivise and reward for the delivery of significant shareholder value. Our 
arrangements are intentionally more leveraged than a standard UK performance share plan: no payouts would be due at a 
threshold level of performance and the higher payout levels would result only where significant shareholder value had been 
created (for example, £1.6 billion of incremental shareholder returns at the Maximum level). 
Remuneration policy scenario chart 
 
The assumptions underlying the chart in respect of the percentage of maximum opportunity payable are set out below: 
Notes: 
(1) Fixed pay comprises basic salary, taxable benefits and pension contributions. 
(2) Annual variable pay represents the annual bonus entitlement. No bonus is assumed at the minimum performance level. Threshold 
performance assumes a payment of 25% of base salary, super stretch performance a payment of 75% of base salary and maximum 
performance a payment of 125% of base salary. 
(3) Long term incentives relate to the Share Plan, in which the executive directors participate. These are illustrative amounts and the actual 
outcomes may differ depending on share price growth. 
(4) The Share Plan vests partly in 2017 and partly in 2018 and therefore the total value of the scheme has been annualised over the 
performance period which is five years for the first set of awards, and four years for the second set of awards made following the Merger. 
For Sebastian James, Humphrey Singer and Katie Bickerstaffe the Share Plan has been annualised over four years. Andrew Harrison and 
Graham Stapleton were granted a second set of awards to align their overall awards with other Dixons participants and therefore the Share 
Plan has been partially annualised over five years and partially over four years. 
(5) No Share Plan payout is assumed at the minimum performance level. Threshold performance for the Share Plan is an annual rate of return 
of 7% on invested capital and therefore there will be no payout at threshold. Super stretch performance reflects the generation of £1 billion 
of incremental shareholder returns over the term of the scheme. Maximum performance is fixed at the point at which the overall dilution  
cap of 4% is expected to apply (each set of awards being subject to a 2% dilution cap), representing £1.6 billion of incremental  
shareholder returns. 
(6) The value of the Share Plan at vesting has been reduced by the value of the loan outstanding (excluding interest payments).

Remuneration Committee discretions 
The Committee retains discretion consistent with market 
practice over a number of areas relating to the operation and 
administration of the bonus plans and long term incentive 
share plans. These include but are not limited to: 
• entitlement to participate in the plan; 
• when awards or payments are to be made; 
• size of award and / or payment (within the rules of the plans); 
• determination of a good leaver for incentive plan purposes 
and the appropriate treatment based on the rules of each 
plan; 
• discretion as to the measurement of performance conditions 
and pro-rating in the event of a change of control; 
• any adjustment to awards or performance conditions for 
significant events or exceptional circumstances; and 
• the application of clawback and malus provisions. 
Shareholder and employee consultation 
The Committee has a policy to consult with its major 
shareholders when making any significant changes to the 
remuneration policy of the Company. Any feedback received is 
taken into consideration when determining future policy. For 
example, in contemplation of the Merger in 2014 a consultation 
took place with major shareholders on various amendments to 
the remuneration policy. As a direct result of that consultation, 
the executive directors were removed from the mid term 
incentive plan. Prior to this, in 2013 an extensive consultation 
exercise took place with the shareholders to seek their views 
on the Carphone Warehouse Share Plan and as a result a 
number of changes were made to the scheme design, 
including the introduction of a cap.  
The Committee also takes into consideration remuneration 
guidance issued by large investor bodies in addition to the 
principles of good governance relating to directors’ 
remuneration as set out in the Code. 
Whilst employees are not formally consulted on executive 
remuneration a number of them are shareholders and as such 
are able to exercise their influence. We also monitor our 
employee discussion boards and employee forums to ensure 
employee feedback in general is considered in all our strategy 
execution. The Company also conducts regular employee 
surveys throughout the business. 
Remuneration policy for the wider workforce 
Dixons Carphone employs a large number of people across 
different countries. Our reward framework is structured around 
a set of common principles with adjustments made to suit the 
needs of the different businesses and employee groups. 
Reward packages differ for a variety of reasons including the 
impact on the business, local practice, custom and legislation. 
In determining salary increases to apply across the wider 
workforce, the Company takes into consideration company 
performance and other market metrics as necessary. When 
setting the policy for executive directors the Committee takes 
into consideration salary increases throughout the Company  
as a whole. 
Discretionary share plans are extended to both senior 
management and other key members of the workforce,  
as the Company feels that it is important to incentivise and 
retain these employees in order for the Company to continue 
to grow.  
The Group’s UK and Irish employees who meet the eligibility 
criteria are also invited to join the Company’s UK and Ireland 
approved SAYE.  
Recruitment or promotion policy 
On appointment or promotion, base salary levels will be set 
taking into account a range of factors including market levels, 
experience, internal relativities and cost. If an individual is 
appointed on a base salary below the desired market 
positioning, the Committee retains the discretion to re-align 
base salary over one to three years, contingent on individual 
performance, which may result in an exceptional rate of 
annualised increase above ordinary levels. If the Committee 
intends to rely on this discretion, it will be noted in the first 
remuneration report following an individual’s appointment. 
Other elements of annual remuneration will be in line with the 
policy set out in the Policy Table. As such, short term variable 
remuneration will be capped as set out in the Policy Table.  
The following exceptions will apply: 
• in the event that an internal appointment is made or an 
executive director joins as a result of a transfer of an 
undertaking, merger, reconstruction or similar 
reorganisation, the Committee retains the discretion to 
continue with existing remuneration provisions, including 
pension contributions and the provision of benefits; 
• as deemed necessary and appropriate to secure an 
appointment, the Committee retains the discretion to make 
additional payments linked to relocation; and 
• the Committee retains the discretion to provide an 
immediate interest in Company performance by making a 
long term incentive award on recruitment in accordance with 
the Policy Table under its existing long term incentive 
schemes or such future schemes as may be introduced by 
the Company with the approval of its shareholders. The 
Committee will determine the level of the award, the 
performance conditions and time horizon that would apply 
to such awards at the time of award, taking into account the 
strategy and business circumstances of the Company. 
Service contracts will be entered into on terms similar to those 
for the existing executive directors, summarised in the 
Recruitment table. However, the Committee may authorise the 
payment of a relocation and / or repatriation allowance, as well 
as other associated international mobility terms and benefits, 
such as tax equalisation and tax advice.    Dixons Carphone plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014/15
Corporate Governance
 
63 
In addition to the annual remuneration elements noted above, 
the Committee may consider buying out on a like-for-like basis 
bonuses and / or incentive awards that an individual forfeits in 
accepting the appointment. The Committee will have the 
authority to rely on Listing Rule 9.4.2(2) or exceptional limits 
within the existing shareholder approved Share and Share 
Option Plans to make awards. If made, the Committee will be 
informed by the structure, time horizons, value and 
performance targets associated with any forfeited awards 
while retaining the discretion to make any payment or award 
deemed necessary and appropriate. The Committee may also 
require the appointee to purchase shares in the Company in 
accordance with its shareholding policy. 
With respect to the appointment of a new Chairman or non-
executive director, terms of appointment will be consistent  
with those currently adopted. Variable pay will not be 
considered and as such no maximum applies. With respect  
to non-executive directors, fees will be consistent with the 
policy at the time of appointment. If necessary, to secure  
the appointment of a new Chairman not based in the UK, 
payments relating to relocation and / or housing can  
be considered. 
Elements of remuneration on appointment are set out in  
the Recruitment table. 
A timely announcement with respect to any director’s 
appointment and remuneration will be made to the  
regulatory news services and posted on the Company’s 
corporate website.

 Benefits and allowances • The Committee retains the discretion to provide additional benefits as 
reasonably required. These may include, but are not restricted to, 
relocation payments, housing allowances and cost of living allowances. 
 
Policy on loss of office 
Service contracts contain neither a liquidated damages nor  
a change of control clause. 
The Company shall have a right to make a payment in lieu of 
notice in respect of basic salary, benefits including car 
allowance and pension contributions only for the director’s 
contractual period of notice or, if termination is part way 
through the notice period, the amount relating to any unexpired 
notice to the date of termination. There is an obligation on 
directors to mitigate any loss which they may suffer if the 
Company terminates their service contract. The Committee will 
take such mitigation obligation into account when determining 
the amount and timing of any compensation payable to any 
departing director. 
A director shall also be entitled to a payment in respect of 
accrued but untaken holiday and any statutory entitlements on 
termination. No compensation is paid for dismissal, save for 
statutory entitlements. 
A director shall be entitled to receive a redundancy payment in 
circumstances where in the judgement of the Committee they 
satisfy the statutory tests governing redundancy payments. 
Any redundancy payment shall be calculated by reference to 
the redundancy payment policy in force for all employees in 
the relevant country at the time of the redundancy.    Dixons Carphone plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014/15 
Corporate Governance
Remuneration Policy report 
64 
If a director’s employment terminates prior to the relevant 
annual bonus payment date, ordinarily no bonus is payable for 
that financial year. The Committee shall retain discretion to 
make a pro-rated bonus payment and / or payment of a 
retention bonus in circumstances where it would be 
appropriate to do so having regard to the contribution of the 
director during the financial year, the circumstances of the 
departure and the best interests of the Company.  
Any entitlements under long term incentive schemes operated 
by the Company shall be determined based on the rules of the 
relevant scheme. The default position under the Dixons 
Carphone Share Plan is that awards will lapse on the 
termination of employment unless the Committee exercises the 
discretion set out in the scheme rules. The Committee retains 
the discretion to prevent awards from lapsing depending on 
the circumstances of the departure and the best interests of 
the Company.  
The Committee shall be entitled to exercise its judgement with 
regard to settlement of potential claims, including but not 
limited to wrongful dismissal, unfair dismissal, breach of 
contract and discrimination, where it is appropriate to do so in 
the interests of the Company and its shareholders.  
In the event that any payment is made in relation to termination 
for an executive director, this will be fully disclosed in the 
following Annual Remuneration report. 
A timely announcement with respect to the termination of any 
director’s appointment will be made to the regulatory news 
service and posted on the Company’s corporate website. 
Service agreements 
Service agreements for executive directors 
Each of the executive directors’ service agreements  
provides for: 
• the reimbursement of expenses incurred by the executive 
director in performance of their duties; 
• 25 days paid holiday each year for Sebastian James, 
Humphrey Singer and Katie Bickerstaffe (full time 
equivalent); 27 days for Andrew Harrison and Graham 
Stapleton;  
• sick pay; and 
• notice periods whereby Sebastian James, Humphrey Singer 
and Katie Bickerstaffe each have a notice period of  
12 months from the Company and six months from the 
director. Andrew Harrison has a notice period of 12 months 
and Graham Stapleton six months from either party. 
In situations where an executive director is dismissed, the 
Committee reserves the right to make additional exit payments 
where such payments are made in good faith, such as: 
• in discharge of a legal obligation; and 
• by way of settlement or compromise of any claim arising in 
connection with the termination of the director’s office and 
employment. 
Letters of appointment 
Each of the non-executive directors has a letter of 
appointment. The Company has no age limit for directors. 
Non-executive directors derive no other benefit from their 
office, except that the Committee retains the discretion to 
continue with existing remuneration provisions, including 
pension contributions and the provision of benefits, where an 
executive director becomes a non-executive director. It is 
Company policy not to grant share options or share awards to 
non-executive directors. The Chairman, Deputy Chairman and 
the other non-executive directors have a notice period of three 
months from either party. 
Appointments are reviewed annually by the Nominations 
Committee and recommendations made to the Board 
accordingly.  
External appointments 
The Board supports executive directors taking non-executive 
directorships as a part of their continuing development, and 
has agreed that the executive directors may retain their fees 
from one such appointment. Further details on current external 
directorships and fees can be found in the Annual 
Remuneration report. 
Availability for inspection 
The service agreements for the executive directors and the 
letters of appointments for the non-executive directors are 
available for inspection at the Company’s registered office and 
at the venue for the Annual General Meeting, 15 minutes prior 
to and during the meeting. 
Legacy arrangements 
For the avoidance of doubt, in approving the Remuneration 
Policy report, authority is given to the Company to honour  
any commitments previously entered into with the current or 
former directors which have been disclosed previously to 
shareholders.

Annual Remuneration report

Only members of the Committee are entitled to attend 
Committee meetings but the Group Chief Executive and  
Group Finance Director (or other senior management)  
may attend meetings by invitation and in an advisory  
capacity only. Meetings are also regularly attended by the 
Company Secretary (who acts as Committee secretary), 
Deputy Company Secretary and the Group Human  
Resources Director. 
No director participates in discussions about their own 
remuneration.  
Responsibilities 
Responsibility for the establishment of an overall remuneration 
policy for the Group lies with the Board. The Remuneration 
Committee has the following principal duties: 
• making recommendations to the Board on the Company’s 
framework of executive remuneration; 
• determining the fees of the Chairman and Deputy Chairman; 
• considering and making recommendations to the Board on 
the remuneration of the executive directors and senior 
management relative to performance and market data; 
• approving contracts of employment which exceed defined 
thresholds of total remuneration or have unusual terms or 
termination periods; 
• considering and agreeing changes to remuneration policy  
or major changes to employee benefit structures; and 
• approving and operating employee share based incentive 
schemes and associated performance conditions  
and targets. 
Advice 
The Committee retained Towers Watson throughout 2014/15 
as independent advisors. Towers Watson is engaged to 
provide advice to the Committee and to work with the directors 
on matters relating to the Group’s executive remuneration and 
its long term incentives. Towers Watson is a member of the 
Remuneration Consultants Group and operates under its code 
of conduct in relation to the provision of executive 
remuneration advice in the UK. Towers Watson has confirmed 
that it adhered to the Code throughout 2014/15 for all 
remuneration services provided to the Group. Towers Watson 
received fees of £82,000 (2013/14: £84,000) in relation to the 
provision of those services. Towers Watson also provided 
actuarial services on behalf of the defined benefit pension 
scheme; however, the Committee has satisfied itself that 
Towers Watson’s advice was objective and independent.  
The Committee may also take external legal advice, where 
required, to assist it in carrying out its duties. 
External directorships 
The policy relating to external directorships is outlined in the 
Remuneration Policy report. For 2014/15, the following external 
directorships were undertaken and the fees retained by the 
executive directors: 
• Sebastian James was appointed a non-executive director of 
Direct Line Insurance Group plc on 28 August 2014 and was 
paid a fee of £53,000 from appointment to 2 May 2015. 
• Katie Bickerstaffe has been a non-executive director of 
Scottish and Southern Energy plc during 2014/15 and was 
paid a fee of £57,000 for the period to 2 May 2015. 
How the remuneration policy will be applied in 2015/16 
Executive directors 
i) Base Salary 
The Committee reviewed the executive directors’ salaries in 
2014 as part of the Merger. Where individuals were appointed 
to new roles, in line with our recruitment policy, base salary 
levels were set taking into account a range of factors including 
market levels, experience and internal relativities.  
Due to the changes in base pay at Merger, no changes are 
proposed to the base salaries of the executive directors  
during 2015/16.

ii) Pension Contributions 
Company Contributions or allowance in lieu will continue in 
2015/16 at their current levels of 10% for Sebastian James, 
Humphrey Singer and Katie Bickerstaffe and 5% Andrew 
Harrison and Graham Stapleton. 
iii) STIP (Annual performance bonus) 
The maximum annual bonus for 2015/16 will be 125% of base 
salary and will operate on a similar basis as for the previous 
year. That is, the measures have been selected to reflect our 
key strategic objectives and are aligned to our Group balanced 
scorecard, with a minimum profit gate that must be achieved 
before any bonus is paid out. The proposed target levels for 
the year have been set to be challenging relative to the 
business plan. The Committee feels that specific targets 
relating to the 2015/16 bonus scheme are currently 
commercially sensitive and as such will not be disclosed. 
However, retrospective disclosure of the targets and 
performance against them will be provided in next year’s 
Remuneration report to the extent that they do not remain 
commercially sensitive at that time.   Dixons Carphone plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014/15

competitors. The Company’s performance up until the period 
ended 29 March 2014, which was prior to the Merger, relates

(1) Remuneration is shown for the period served on the Board. The following directors were appointed on 6 August 2014: Sebastian James, 
Humphrey Singer, Katie Bickerstaffe, Graham Stapleton, Andrea Gisle Joosen, Tim How and Jock Lennox. Remuneration / fees for these 
directors is shown from appointment to 2 May 2015. John Allan was appointed to the Board on 6 August 2014 and resigned on 17 February 
2015 and the fees shown are for this period. Nigel Langstaff and John Allwood resigned from the Board on 6 August 2014 and remuneration 
/ fees are from 1 April 2014 to date of leaving. 
(2) Pension contributions comprise the Company’s contribution or allowance in lieu together with the salary supplement which is based on the 
difference between basic salary and the scheme earnings cap set by the Company. This additional amount was 10% for Sebastian James, 
Humphrey Singer and Katie Bickerstaffe and 5% for Andrew Harrison, Nigel Langstaff and Graham Stapleton.  
(3) Annual bonus for Graham Stapleton and base salary and annual bonus for Andrew Harrison represents the amount earned over 13 months 
following the alignment of the financial year end. Annual bonuses for Sebastian James, Humphrey Singer and Katie Bickerstaffe represent 
the amount earned over the 12 months to 2 May 2015, which includes the period prior to the Merger. All bonuses are calculated based on 
the directors’ annual salary as at 2 May 2015. 
(4) Taxable benefits include private medical insurance, car allowance and Sharesave gains of £4,000 for Sebastian James, Humphrey Singer 
and Katie Bickerstaffe in respect of options granted on 26 February 2015 as set out in the table on page 72. 
(5) LTIP payments would comprise amounts under the Share Plan, however, the vesting periods end in July 2017 and July 2018. 
(6) In addition to the above remuneration and subsequent to resigning from the Board on 6 August 2014, Nigel Langstaff received a 
redundancy payment of £247,000 upon leaving the business in December 2014. Nigel also received £350,000 as a payment in lieu of notice 
in respect of basic salary, £19,700 in respect of benefits (including car allowance, permanent health insurance and life cover) and £17,500 in 
respect of pension contributions. There was no payment for accrued holiday untaken. These amounts were in line with contractual 
entitlements and the Group’s redundancy payments policy and no discretion was applied in their determination. The Committee determined

(1) Pension contributions comprise the Company’s contribution to a defined contribution pension scheme or allowance in lieu of contribution to 
a pension scheme. This additional amount was 5%.  
(2) LTIP payments would comprise amounts under the Share Plan, however, the vesting periods end in July 2017 and July 2018. 
(3) Andrew Harrison joined the Board on 24 July 2013 and the remuneration shown is for the period he was a director. 
(4) Sir Charles Dunstone and Roger Taylor were employed by the Company during this period and their pay was reviewed by the Remuneration 
Committee. 
(5) Roger Taylor’s remuneration relates to his tenure both as an executive director until 24 July 2013 and subsequently as Deputy Chairman. 
(6) No payments were made to former directors and no payment for loss of office were made during the year. 
 
Long term incentive plans (LTIP) 
The Share Plan awards made during 2014/15 vest in July 2017 (60%) and July 2018 (40%).  
Details of the awards made and the loans granted to the directors to enable them to subscribe for shares under the Share Plan 
are detailed later in this report. 
No LTIPs have vested during the year for the directors whilst serving on the Board. Nigel Langstaff’s share entitlements under 
the Share Plan lapsed on leaving the Group. 
Annual bonus for 2014/15 
During the year the maximum bonus opportunity for all executive directors was aligned to 125% of base salary. In addition, due 
to the Merger and the change to the financial year end the annual bonus measures and targets were reset (as shown below) to 
reflect the new merged business. All targets are expressed and will be measured on a pro forma basis, as though the Merger 
had occurred at the beginning of the financial year, and reflecting the respective 12 and 13 month periods for Dixons and 
Carphone, respectively.  
The Committee determined at the beginning of the year that the disclosure of performance targets were commercially sensitive 
and these were therefore not disclosed. This was because targets were set within the context of a longer term business plan and 
this disclosure could give information to competitors to the detriment of business performance. The Committee has however 
disclosed in the table below the targets on a retrospective basis and the actual performance against these. 
Bonus payments will be at maximum levels and will be paid at 125% of base salary. The bonus amounts to be paid to the 
executive directors in respect of 2014/15 are set out in the directors’ remuneration table on page 68.   Dixons Carphone plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014/15

The maximum annual bonus of 125% of base salary is payable at the maximum level of performance and 75% of base salary

Non-executive directors’ and chairman’s fees 
The fees for the independent non-executive directors are determined by the Board (excluding non-executive directors) after 
considering external market research and are reviewed on an annual basis. Factors taken into consideration include the required 
time commitment, specific experience and / or qualifications. A base fee is payable and additional fees are paid for chairing and 
membership of committees. The Chairman is not involved in the setting of his own salary which is dealt with by the 
Remuneration Committee annually. The Deputy Chairman’s fee is set by the Remuneration Committee with the Deputy 
Chairman being absent. Non-executive directors receive no variable pay and receive no additional benefits, except in situations 
where an executive director becomes a non-executive director and benefit and pension arrangements continue.  
For 2015/16, independent non-executive directors will receive a basic fee of £60,000 (2014/15: £45,000) and additional fees as 
set out in the table below for chairing or membership of committees. The increase in fees paid to non-executive directors reflects 
the increased size and complexity of the Group following the Merger.

Directors’ interests in shares 
Share ownership guidelines 
The Company has a policy of encouraging executive directors to build shareholdings in the Company. Following the Merger the 
Committee reviewed the shareholding policy and as a result all executive directors are required within five years to build up 
200% of their salary as a holding in the Company. Other key senior management roles are required to build up 100% of salary. 
The actual shareholdings of the executive directors are set out in the Directors’ shareholding table below. 
Directors’ interests in the Share Plan 
The table below shows the allocation to the executive directors of participation shares in the subsidiary, New CPW Limited, in 
relation to the Share Plan, together with details of the loans issued to enable the directors to subscribe to the participation 
shares. As set out in the policy table there are two pools under the share plan, one for the original grant in December 2013 and 
one for the second grant post Merger. The calculation of the pools is set out on pages 58 and 60 of the Policy Table and in 
particular the performance period ends in July 2017, when 60% of the shares vests with 40% being deferred for a further year.

Financial statements
Statement of Directors’ responsibilities 
75 
The directors are responsible for preparing the annual report and the financial statements in accordance with applicable law  
and regulations. 
Company law requires the directors to prepare financial statements for each financial year. Under that law the directors are 
required to prepare the consolidated financial statements in accordance with IFRS and Article 4 of the IAS Regulation and have 
elected to prepare the Company financial statements in accordance with UK GAAP. Under company law the directors must not 
approve the accounts unless they are satisfied that they give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Company and the 
Group and of the profit or loss of the Company and the Group for that period.  
In preparing the Company financial statements, the directors are required to: 
• select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently; 
• make judgements and accounting estimates that are reasonable and prudent; 
• state whether applicable UK GAAP has been followed, subject to any material departures disclosed and explained in the 
financial statements; and 
• prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Company will 
continue in business. 
In preparing the consolidated financial statements, IAS 1 ‘Presentation of Financial Statements’ requires that directors: 
• properly select and apply accounting policies; 
• present information, including accounting policies, in a manner that provides relevant, reliable, comparable and 
understandable information;  
• provide additional disclosures when compliance with the specific requirements in IFRS are insufficient to enable users to 
understand the impact of particular transactions, other events and conditions on the Group’s financial position and financial 
performance; and 
• make an assessment of the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern. 
The directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain the Company’s 
transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the Company and the Group and enable 
them to ensure that the financial statements comply with the Companies Act 2006. They are also responsible for safeguarding 
the assets of the Company and the Group and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and 
other irregularities. 
The directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the corporate and financial information included on the 
Group’s website. Legislation in the United Kingdom governing the preparation and dissemination of financial statements may 
differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.  
Responsibility statement 
We confirm that to the best of our knowledge: 
• the financial statements, prepared in accordance with the relevant financial reporting framework, give a true and fair view of 
the assets, liabilities, financial position and profit or loss of the Company and the undertakings included in the consolidation 
taken as a whole; 
• the Strategic report includes a fair review of the development and performance of the business and the position of the 
Company and the undertakings included in the consolidation taken as a whole, together with a description of the principal 
risks and uncertainties that they face; and 
• the annual report and financial statements, taken as a whole, are fair, balanced and understandable and provide the 
information necessary for shareholders to assess the Group and the Company’s performance, business model and strategy.

Opinion on the financial statements of Dixons Carphone plc  
In our opinion,  
• the financial statements give a true and fair view of the state of the Group's and of the parent Company's affairs as at 2 May 
2015 and of the Group's profit for the period then ended; 
• the Group financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards 
(IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union; 
• the parent company financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with United Kingdom Generally 
Accepted Accounting Practice (UK GAAP); and 
• the Group financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 and, as 
regards the Group financial statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation. 
The financial statements comprise the consolidated income statement, the consolidated statement of comprehensive income, 
the consolidated balance sheet, the consolidated statement of changes in equity, the consolidated cash flow statement and the 
related notes 1 to 30, and the parent Company balance sheet and the related notes C1 to C12. The financial reporting framework 
that has been applied in the preparation of the Group financial statements is applicable law and IFRSs as adopted by the 
European Union. The financial reporting framework that has been applied in the preparation of the parent Company financial 
statements is applicable law and United Kingdom Accounting Standards (UK GAAP). 
Separate opinion in relation to IFRSs as issued by the IASB  
As explained in note 1 to the Group financial statements, in addition to complying with its legal obligation to apply IFRSs as 
adopted by the European Union, the Group has also applied IFRSs as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board 
(IASB). 
In our opinion the Group financial statements comply with IFRSs as issued by the IASB.  
Going concern 
As required by the Listing Rules we have reviewed the Directors’ statement contained on page 26 that the Group is a going 
concern. We confirm that: 
• we have concluded that the directors' use of the going concern basis of accounting in the preparation of the financial 
statements is appropriate; and 
• we have not identified any material uncertainties that may cast significant doubt on the group's ability to continue as a going 
concern. 
However, because not all future events or conditions can be predicted, this statement is not a guarantee as to the Group’s ability 
to continue as a going concern. 
Our assessment of risks and material misstatement 
The assessed risks of material misstatement described below are those that had the greatest effect on our audit strategy, the 
allocation of resources in the audit and directing the efforts of the engagement team. The key risks we identified are: 
• Acquisition accounting; 
• Impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets; 
• Assets held for sale, discontinued operations and disposal accounting; 
• Revenue recognition - network commissions; 
• Supplier funding; 
• Inventory provisioning; and 
• Taxation.

Risk How the scope of our audit responded to the risk  
Acquisition accounting 
The identification and determination of the fair value of 
intangible assets arising from the acquisition of Dixons 
Retail plc and the recognition of fair value adjustments 
through the associated purchase price allocation 
process involves complex accounting considerations. 
Management engaged external valuation experts in 
relation to this process. £3,002 million of intangible 
assets, including brand names of £365 million, customer 
relationships of £8 million and goodwill of £2,629 million 
have been recognised in the period. The intangible asset 
identification and valuation process requires 
management judgement in respect of estimates of future 
cash flows and associated discount rates in addition to 
economic lives.  
Fair value adjustments, in particular those arising from 
property, plant & equipment, pre-existing intangible 
assets and property operating leases, require significant 
judgement in relation to fair value at the date of 
acquisition, for which management also engaged 
external valuation experts.  
Further information in relation to this area is discussed in 
notes 1u) and 23 to the Group financial statements. 
We tested the design and implementation of the controls around 
management’s process for both the identification and valuation of 
intangible assets and fair value adjustments. We used our internal 
valuation specialists to consider and evaluate the appropriateness of 
the methodologies applied and to test the inputs to the valuation 
models used to determine the value of the intangible assets, including 
the discount rates, growth rates and useful economic lives, through 
comparing these against industry benchmarks on similar assets and 
our understanding of the future prospects of the business. We also 
tested the appropriateness of the cash flow projections used in  
the valuations. 
For the other significant fair value adjustments, we obtained 
appropriate support for the adjustments, reviewed any assumptions 
against relevant industry and company data to assess the 
appropriateness of the adjustments, and utilised internal valuation 
specialists where appropriate. 
 
 
 
Impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets 
The Group has significant acquisition related intangible 
assets, including goodwill, (£3,351 million at 2 May 2015 
including £2,989 million of goodwill and £362 million of 
acquisition intangibles, related to the CPW Europe 
Acquisition in the prior year and in the current year the 
acquisition of Dixons Retail plc). The Group’s 
assessment of impairment of acquisition related 
intangible assets, primarily arising from the CPW Europe 
and Dixons Retail plc acquisitions, is a judgemental 
process which requires estimates concerning the future 
cash flows and associated discount rates and growth 
rates based on management’s projections of future 
business performance and prospects. The key 
judgements and estimates involved are described in 
more detail in notes 1l), 1m) and 1u) to the Group 
financial statements. 
We assessed the assumptions used by management in the 
impairment models for goodwill and acquisition related intangible 
assets, including the allocation to cash generating units described in 
note 9 to the Group financial statements, and more specifically the 
cash flow projections, discount rates (utilising the assistance of our 
valuation specialists), and long term growth rates used against 
historical performance, our understanding of the future prospects of 
the business and comparison against market rates and the prevailing 
Group cost of capital at the year end. We have audited the mechanics 
of the impairment models prepared by management. 
Assets held for sale, discontinued operations and 
disposal accounting  
The classification and valuation of net assets in the 
Phone House operations in the Netherlands, Germany 
and Portugal as held for sale at the balance sheet date is 
a key area of management judgement. In addition, the 
classification of these businesses as discontinued 
operations must be carefully considered in line with the 
relevant accounting standard. Further information is 
included in note 24 to the Group financial statements. 
We tested the design and implementation of controls which 
management have in place around planned and completed  
disposal activities. 
We challenged management’s judgement on the classification and 
valuation of assets held for sale through understanding the status of 
the sales process and reviewing correspondence from purchasers and 
prospective purchasers. This included consideration of any relevant 
disposal provisions with reference to the sales agreements and 
supporting documentation. We also assessed the classification of 
disposed businesses and other assets held for sale as discontinued 
operations against the relevant criteria in the accounting standard.

Risk How the scope of our audit responded to the risk  
Revenue recognition – network commissions  
Commission receivable on sales, being commission 
which is contractually committed, and for which there 
are no ongoing performance obligations, is dependent 
on customer behaviour beyond the point of sale. 
Management is therefore required to exercise 
judgement in respect of the level of customer default 
within the contract period, expected levels of customer 
spend and customer behaviour beyond the initial 
contract period. The key judgements and estimates 
involved are described in more detail in notes 1d) and 
1u) to the Group financial statements. 
We evaluated the design and implementation of both the manual and 
automated controls over the revenue recognition process in respect  
of commissions receivable, utilising IT specialists to assist with testing 
of automated controls. In addition we tested that these controls were 
operating effectively throughout the period.  
We have tested the valuation of revenue recognised through review  
of the Group’s contractual arrangements, substantive testing of 
management assumptions including tenure, line rental, and churn to 
third party network data and testing of subsequent cash receipts.  
We have also assessed any changes in estimate in comparison to the 
prior year and reviewed year on year movement in key assumptions. 
Supplier funding 
The Group holds a number of significant funding 
arrangements with suppliers. Agreements in relation to 
supplier funding are based predominantly on volume-
related targets, for both purchases and sales, and are 
most commonly agreed as a fixed percentage of targets 
upfront. These targets are generally a mix of quarterly 
and annual targets and are mostly coterminous with the 
Group’s year end. The timing of recognition of this 
income is sometimes judgemental, in particular where 
the target period for measuring achievements spans the 
year end and it is necessary to ensure there is sufficient 
formal documentation justifying recognition. As a result, 
and given the increased focus on this area by 
management and investors, we have elevated the 
treatment of supplier funding to be a significant risk  
area this year. The key judgements and estimates 
involved are described in more detail in note 1u) to the 
Group financial statements. 
We obtained an understanding of the key supplier funding 
arrangements across the Group. As part of this, we met with the key 
commercial and finance process owners, we tested the design and 
implementation of the Group’s key controls in operation, principally 
focused on those that determine the appropriate timing of recognition 
for supplier funding balances, and we performed an analytical 
assessment of movements in supplier funding throughout the  
current year to historical trends.  
To ensure there is sufficient evidence to support the recognition  
of supplier funding, we substantively tested and recalculated a  
sample of amounts with reference to third party contracts. We  
also obtained confirmations received following circularisation of  
a sample of suppliers. 
Inventory provisioning 
Inventory is a significant balance for the Group  
(£920 million at 2 May 2015) and there are a number  
of judgemental areas including obsolescence and 
shrinkage provisioning. This risk has a significant effect 
on our audit strategy, the allocation of resources in the 
audit and directing the efforts of the engagement team  
in the legacy Dixons side of the business only, given the 
nature and relative significance of the inventory balances 
within each part of the Group. Further information in 
relation to this area is discussed in notes 1q) and 1u)  
to the Group financial statements. 
We have performed testing of the operating effectiveness of controls 
around the inventory business cycle and attended a sample of 
inventory counts at 31 stores and distribution centres across the UK 
and Nordics, including visiting the Group’s main distribution centre in 
Newark on five separate occasions, which enables us to assess 
management’s processes for monitoring inventory. We performed 
audit tests to assess whether inventory is valued at the lower of cost 
and net realisable value. We reviewed, recalculated and assessed the 
inventory ageing and provisioning for reasonableness, including 
challenging the appropriateness of provisioning with reference to both 
historical and post year end performance and a review of the provision 
as a percentage of gross stock year on year. We have also considered 
the impact of range changes and other specific known areas of over-
stock on the required provision calculation. 
Taxation 
The Group operates in a number of different tax 
jurisdictions. The nature of the Group’s operations and 
related transactions can give rise to uncertain tax 
treatments, including with respect to transfer pricing, 
thereby requiring the use of estimates and assumptions 
which may be subsequently challenged by the relevant 
tax authorities.  
Further information in relation to this area is discussed  
in notes 1k) and 1u) to the Group financial statements. 
We used our internal tax specialists to evaluate and test 
management’s assumptions in respect of tax related provisions, 
including assessment against local tax legislation and review of 
supporting documentation.

Last year our report included one other risk which is not included in our report this year and related to the Group’s 
announcement of its planned exit from the French retail market in April 2013. The Dixons Retail plc audit report also included 
risks related to non-underlying items, defined benefit pension assumptions and customer support agreement revenue 
recognition. In the new enlarged Group, these risks do not represent areas that had the greatest effect on our audit strategy,  
the allocation of resources in the audit and directing the efforts of the engagement team. 
The description of risks above should be read in conjunction with the significant issues considered by the Audit Committee 
discussed on page 49 and 50. 
Our audit procedures relating to these matters were designed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, 
and not to express an opinion on individual accounts or disclosures. Our opinion on the financial statements is not modified with 
respect to any of the risks described above, and we do not express an opinion on these individual matters. 
Our application of materiality 
We define materiality as the magnitude of misstatement in the financial statements that makes it probable that the economic 
decisions of a reasonably knowledgeable person would be changed or influenced. We use materiality both in planning the scope 
of our audit work and in evaluating the results of our work. 
We determined materiality for the group to be £14.0 million, which is below 5% of adjusted Headline profit before tax, and below 
1% of equity. In using adjusted headline profit before tax, we have followed the Group’s definition of Headline results in note 1a) 
and adjusted this to include the impact of the amortisation of acquisition intangibles and pension finance costs due to their 
recurring nature. We have assessed the use of a Headline measure to be appropriate as this continues to be a key driver of 
business value, is a critical component of the financial statements and the main measure which management uses to monitor  
the performance of the business and communicate this to shareholders. 
In 2013/14 materiality was £6.0 million, below 5% of Headline profit before tax and below 2% of equity.  
We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to the Committee all audit differences in excess of £500,000  
(2013/14: £120,000), as well as differences below that threshold that, in our view, warranted reporting on qualitative grounds.  
We also report to the Audit Committee on disclosure matters that we identified when assessing the overall presentation of the 
financial statements. 
An overview of the scope of our audit  
We have reassessed our group audit scope following the acquisition of Dixons Retail plc and accordingly have no longer 
performed full scope audits in Portugal or Ireland.  
Our group audit was scoped by obtaining an understanding of the Group and its environment, including group-wide controls, 
and assessing the risks of material misstatement at the group level. Based on that assessment, we focused our group audit 
scope primarily on the audit work of the retail operations operating under the Dixons and Carphone brands in the UK, and those 
operations in the Nordics, Germany, Spain and the Netherlands. Each of these components requires a local statutory audit. 
These locations represent the principal business units and account for approximately 93% of the Group’s revenue arising from 
continuing operations (2013/14: 95%). In addition, an audit of specified account balances was performed in Greece. Each 
location was selected to provide an appropriate basis for undertaking audit work to address the risks of material misstatement 
identified above. Our audit work at these locations was executed at a level of materiality applicable to each individual entity 
which was lower than group materiality and ranged from £1.0 million to £8.0 million. 
At the Dixons Carphone plc parent entity level we also tested the consolidation process and carried out analytical procedures to 
confirm our conclusion that there were no significant risks of material misstatement of the aggregated financial information of the 
remaining components not subject to audit or audit of specified account balances. 
The Group audit team is closely involved in the audit of the two UK components, being the largest part of the Group, throughout 
the year including attendance at key audit planning and closing meetings. In addition, the Group audit team continued to follow a 
programme of planned visits to overseas components that has been designed so that a senior member of the Group audit team 
visits the most significant locations each year. For the period ended 2 May 2015, a senior member of the Group audit team 
visited Norway, Spain, and Germany. In years when we do not visit a particular significant component we will include the 
component audit team in our team briefing, discuss their risk assessment, and review documentation of the findings from  
their work.   Dixons Carphone plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014/15

Opinion on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006 
In our opinion: 
• the part of the Directors' Remuneration report to be audited has been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies 
Act 2006; and 
• the information given in the Strategic report and the Directors' report for the financial year for which the financial statements 
are prepared is consistent with the financial statements. 
Matters on which we are required to report by exception  
Adequacy of explanations received and accounting records  
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if, in our opinion: 
• we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit; or 
• adequate accounting records have not been kept by the parent company, or returns adequate for our audit have not been 
received from branches not visited by us; or 
• the parent company financial statements are not in agreement with the accounting records and returns. 
We have nothing to report in respect of these matters. 
Directors’ remuneration  
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are also required to report if in our opinion certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration 
have not been made or the part of the Directors’ Remuneration report to be audited is not in agreement with the accounting 
records and returns. We have nothing to report arising from these matters.  
Corporate Governance statement  
Under the Listing Rules we are also required to review the part of the Corporate Governance statement relating to the company’s 
compliance with 10 provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code. We have nothing to report arising from our review. 
Our duty to read other information in the Annual Report and Accounts 
Under International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland), we are required to report to you if, in our opinion, information in the 
Annual Report and Accounts is: 
• materially inconsistent with the information in the audited financial statements; or 
• apparently materially incorrect based on, or materially inconsistent with, our knowledge of the Group acquired in the course  
of performing our audit; or 
• otherwise misleading. 
In particular, we are required to consider whether we have identified any inconsistencies between our knowledge acquired 
during the audit and the directors’ statement that they consider the annual report is fair, balanced and understandable  
and whether the Annual Report and Accounts appropriately discloses those matters that we communicated to the Audit 
Committee which we consider should have been disclosed. We confirm that we have not identified any such inconsistencies  
or misleading statements. 
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditor 
As explained more fully in the Statement of Directors’ responsibilities, the directors are responsible for the preparation of the 
financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view. Our responsibility is to audit and express an 
opinion on the financial statements in accordance with applicable law and International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland). 
Those standards require us to comply with the Auditing Practices Board’s Ethical Standards for Auditors. We also comply with 
International Standard on Quality Control 1 (UK and Ireland). Our audit methodology and tools aim to ensure that our quality 
control procedures are effective, understood and applied. Our quality controls and systems include our dedicated professional 
standards review team and independent partner reviews. 
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 
2006. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the Company’s members those matters we are required to 
state to them in an auditor’s report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume 
responsibility to anyone other than the company and the company’s members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for 
the opinions we have formed.

Scope of the audit of the financial statements  
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give reasonable 
assurance that the financial statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. This includes an 
assessment of: whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the Group’s and the parent Company’s circumstances and 
have been consistently applied and adequately disclosed; the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by the 
directors; and the overall presentation of the financial statements. In addition, we read all the financial and non-financial 
information in the Annual Report to identify material inconsistencies with the audited financial statements and to identify any 
information that is apparently materially incorrect based on, or materially inconsistent with, the knowledge acquired by us in the 
course of performing the audit. If we become aware of any apparent material misstatements or inconsistencies, we consider  
the implications for our report.

Notes to the Group financial statements 
87 
1 Accounting policies 
a) Basis of preparation 
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared on 
a going concern basis in accordance with IFRS as adopted  
by the EU, IFRS issued by the International Accounting 
Standards Board, those parts of the Companies Act 2006 
applicable to those companies reporting under IFRS and 
Article 4 of the IAS Regulation. 
The financial statements have been presented in UK Sterling, 
the functional currency of the Company, and on the historical 
cost basis except for the revaluation of certain financial 
instruments, as explained below. All amounts have been 
rounded to the nearest £1 million, unless otherwise stated.  
The principal accounting policies adopted are set out below. 
As described in note 23, on 6 August 2014, the Group 
completed the merger of Dixons and Carphone, which was 
implemented by way of a scheme of arrangement of Dixons. 
The Company has been renamed Dixons Carphone plc. Under 
the terms of the Merger, Dixons Shareholders received 0.155 
of a new Dixons Carphone Share in exchange for each Dixons 
share. In accordance with the criteria set out in IFRS 3 
‘Business Combinations’ it has been determined that 
Carphone acquired Dixons. 
Certain line item descriptions within the income statement and 
balance sheet have been adapted to better represent the 
newly merged group and are intended to be presented on this 
basis going forwards. 
Historically, the Group prepared its financial statements to the 
Saturday closest to its accounting reference date of 31 March. 
Following the Merger, the Group changed its accounting 
reference date to 30 April which was the accounting reference 
date of Dixons, but will continue to draw up accounts to the 
nearest Saturday. Accordingly the current financial period is for 
the 13 months ended 2 May 2015 whilst the comparative 
period is for the 12 month period ended 29 March 2014. 
The Group’s income statement and segmental analysis identify 
separately Headline performance and Non-Headline items. 
Headline performance measures reflect adjustments to total 
performance measures. The directors consider ‘Headline’ 
performance measures to be a more accurate reflection of the 
ongoing trading performance of the Group and believe that 
these measures provide additional useful information for 
shareholders on the Group’s performance and are consistent 
with how business performance is measured internally. 
Headline results are stated before the results of discontinued 
operations or exited / to be exited businesses, amortisation of 
acquisition intangibles, any exceptional items considered so 
one off and material that they distort underlying performance 
(such as reorganisation costs, impairment charges and other 
non-recurring charges) and net pension interest costs. 
Businesses exited or to be exited are those which the Group 
has exited or committed to or commenced to exit through 
disposal or closure but do not meet the definition of 
discontinued operations as stipulated by IFRS and are  
material to the results and operations of the Group. 
Non-Headline items in the current and prior year comprise 
amortisation of acquisition intangibles, Merger integration and 
transaction costs, CPW Europe Acquisition related items, 
Phone House France operating and closure costs whilst it 
formed part of the CPW Europe joint venture, net interest on 
defined benefit pension schemes and discontinued operations 
(comprising Virgin Mobile France and Phone House operations 
in France, Germany, Netherlands and Portugal). A 
reconciliation of Headline profit and losses to total profits and 
losses is shown in note 2. Items excluded from Headline 
results can evolve from one financial year to the next 
depending on the nature of exceptional items or one-off type 
activities described above and the exclusion of pension 
interest is such an item applicable to the 13 months ended  
2 May 2015. Headline performance measures and Non-
Headline performance measures may not be directly 
comparable with other similarly titled measures or ‘adjusted’ 
revenue or profit measures used by other companies. 
The results for the year ended 29 March 2014 have been 
restated to recognise the results of the operations in France, 
Germany, Netherlands and Portugal as discontinued 
operations. Therefore financial information in the income 
statement, cash flows statement and associated notes have 
been restated to reflect this classification. 
Gains on disposal of non-core businesses in Southern Europe 
have been included in Headline results net of restructuring 
costs. The net impact of these activities totalled £5 million. 
Since the period ended 2 November 2014, the Group applied 
adjustments to the fair values of assets and liabilities acquired 
through the Merger. These adjustments resulted in the fair 
value of identifiable net liabilities acquired reducing from  
£656 million to £647 million resulting in a reduction in the 
goodwill recognised from £2,638 million to £2,629 million. 
Going concern 
The Group’s funding arrangements and processes for 
managing its exposure to liquidity risk are set out in notes  
17 and 25.  
In their consideration of going concern, the directors have 
reviewed the Group’s future cash forecasts and profit 
projections, which are based on market data and past 
experience. This review considered the implications of the 
Merger and the continuing uncertainty in Greece, including the 
effect on forecast cash flows and changes to the Group’s 
financing facilities. The directors are of the opinion that the 
Group’s forecasts and projections, which take into account 
reasonably possible changes in trading performance, show 
that the Group is able to operate within its current facilities and 
comply with its banking covenants for the foreseeable future. 
In arriving at their conclusion that the Group has adequate 
financial resources, the directors were mindful of the level of 
borrowings and facilities as set out in note 17 to the Group 
financial statements and that the Group has a robust policy 
towards liquidity and cash flow management. 
Accordingly the directors have a reasonable expectation that 
the Company and the Group have adequate resources to 
continue in operation for the foreseeable future and 
consequently the directors continue to apply the going 
concern basis in the preparation of the financial statements.    Dixons Carphone plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014/15 
Financial statements
Notes to the Group financial statements 
88 
The principal accounting policies are set out below: 
b) Accounting convention and basis of consolidation 
The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial 
statements of the Company and entities controlled by the 
Company (its subsidiaries). Control is achieved where the 
Company has the power over the investee; is exposed, or has 
rights, to variable return from its involvement with the investee; 
and has the ability to use its power to affects its returns. 
The results of subsidiaries and joint ventures acquired or sold 
during the year are included in the consolidated income 
statement from the effective date of acquisition or up to the 
effective date of disposal as appropriate, which is the date 
from which the power to control passes. Where necessary, 
adjustments are made to the financial statements of 
subsidiaries to bring the accounting policies used into line with 
those used by the Group. All intercompany transactions and 
balances are eliminated on consolidation.  
c) Foreign currency translation and transactions  
Material transactions in foreign currencies are hedged using 
forward purchases or sales of the relevant currencies and are 
recognised in the financial statements at the exchange rates 
thus obtained. Unhedged transactions are recorded at the 
exchange rate on the date of the transaction. Material 
monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign 
currencies are hedged, mainly using forward foreign exchange 
contracts to create matching liabilities and assets, and are 
retranslated at each balance sheet date. Hedge accounting  
as defined by IAS 39 ‘Financial Instruments: Recognition and 
Measurement’ has been applied by marking to market the 
relevant financial instruments at the balance sheet date and 
recognising the gain or loss in reserves in respect of cash  
flow hedges, and through profit or loss in respect of fair  
value hedges. 
The results of overseas operations are translated at the 
average foreign exchange rates for the year, and their balance 
sheets are translated at the rates prevailing at the balance 
sheet date. Goodwill is held in the currency of the operation to 
which it relates. Exchange differences arising on the translation 
of net assets, goodwill and results of overseas operations are 
recognised in the translation reserve. All other exchange 
differences are included in profit or loss in the year in which 
they arise except where the Group designates financial 
instruments held for the purpose of hedging the foreign 
currency exposures that result from material transactions 
undertaken in foreign currencies as cash flow hedges, hedge 
accounting as defined by IAS 39 ‘Financial Instruments: 
Recognition and Measurement’ is applied. The effective 
portion of changes in the fair value of financial instruments  
that are designated as cash flow hedges is recognised in  
other comprehensive income. The gain or loss relating to the 
ineffective portion is recognised in profit or loss. Amounts 
previously recognised in equity are reclassified to profit or  
loss in the periods when the hedged item is recognised in 
profit or loss. 
Where a foreign operation is disposed of, the gain or loss on 
disposal recognised in profit or loss is determined after taking 
into account the cumulative currency translation differences 
that are attributable to the operation. The principal exchange 
rates against UK Sterling used in these financial statements are 
as follows: 
Average Closing
2015 2014 2015 2014
Euro 1.28 1.19 1.35 1.21 
Norwegian Krone 10.86 — 11.51 — 
Swedish Krona 11.85 10.36 12.72 10.82 
 
d) Revenue 
Revenue comprises sales of goods and services excluding 
sales taxes. The following accounting policies are applied to 
the principal revenue generating activities in which the Group  
is engaged: 
• revenue from the sale of goods is recognised at the point of 
sale or, where later, upon delivery to the customer and is 
stated net of returns; 
• revenue earned from customer support agreements is 
recognised over the life of the agreement by reference to the 
stage of completion of the transaction at the balance sheet 
date; 
• revenue arising on services is recognised when the relevant 
services are provided; 
• commission receivable on sales, being commission which is 
contractually committed, and for which there are no ongoing 
performance obligations, is recognised when the sales to 
which the commission relates are made, net of any provision 
for promotional offers and network operator performance 
penalties. Commission includes a share of customer airtime 
spend, to the extent that it can be reliably measured and 
there are no ongoing service obligations. Where the time 
value of money has a material impact, an appropriate 
discount is applied such that revenue is recognised at an 
amount equal to the present value of the future 
consideration to be received; 
• other ongoing revenue is recognised as it is earned over the 
lives of the relevant customers; 
• volume bonuses receivable from network operators are 
recognised when the conditions on which they are earned 
have been met; 
• insurance premiums are typically paid either monthly or 
quarterly in advance. Sales commission paid by third parties 
is recognised when the insurance policies to which it relates 
are sold, to the extent that it can be reliably measured and 
there are no ongoing service obligations. Insurance premium 
income for the provision of ongoing insurance services is 
recognised over the lives of the relevant policies; 
• revenue from the sale of prepaid credits is deferred until the 
customer uses the airtime or the credit expires; and 
• revenue generated from the provision of fixed and mobile 
network services is recognised as it is earned over the lives 
of the relevant customers. 
e) Other income, including non-operating income 
Other income, which is incidental to the Group’s principal 
activities of selling goods and services and accordingly is not 
recorded as part of revenue, is recognised when the Group   Dixons Carphone plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014/15
Financial statements
 
89 
obtains the right to consideration by performance of its 
contractual obligations. Interest income is accrued on a time 
basis, by reference to the principal outstanding and at the 
effective interest rate applicable. 
f) Discontinued operations and assets and liabilities  
held for sale 
A discontinued operation is a component of the Group which 
represents a significant separate line of business, either 
through its activity or geographical area of operation, which 
has been sold, is held for sale or has been closed.  
Where the sale of a component of the Group is considered 
highly probable and the business is available for immediate 
sale in its present condition, it is classified as held for sale. 
Such classification assumes the expectation that the sale will 
complete within one year from the date of classification. Assets 
and liabilities held for sale are measured at the lower of 
carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell. Once 
classified as held for sale, intangible assets and property,  
plant & equipment are no longer amortised or depreciated. 
g) Share-based payments  
Equity settled share-based payments are measured at fair 
value at the date of grant, and expensed on a straight line 
basis over the vesting period, based on an estimate of the 
number of shares that will eventually vest. 
Where share-based payments are subject only to service 
conditions or internal performance criteria (such as EPS 
targets), fair value is measured using either a Binomial model 
or a Black Scholes model. Where share-based payments have 
external performance criteria (such as TSR targets) a Monte 
Carlo model is used to measure fair value. 
For all schemes, the number of options expected to vest is 
recalculated at each balance sheet date, based on 
expectations of leavers prior to vesting. For schemes with 
internal performance criteria, the number of options expected 
to vest is also adjusted based on expectations of performance 
against target. No adjustment is made for expected 
performance against external performance criteria. The 
movement in cumulative expense since the previous balance 
sheet date is recognised in the income statement, with a 
corresponding entry in reserves. 
If a share-based payment scheme is cancelled, any remaining 
part of the fair value of the scheme is expensed through the 
income statement. If a share-based payment scheme is 
forfeited, no further expense is recognised and any charges 
previously recognised through the income statement  
are reversed. 
Charges also arise on loans that are provided to employees to 
fund the purchase of shares as part of long term incentive 
plans. To the extent to which the loans are not, in certain 
circumstances, repayable, the cost of the relevant part of  
such loans is expensed over the course of the relevant 
incentive plans. 
h) Retirement benefit obligations 
Company contributions to defined contribution pension 
schemes and contributions made to state pension schemes  
for certain overseas employees are charged to the income 
statement on an accruals basis when employees have 
rendered service entitling them to the contributions. 
For defined benefit pension schemes, the difference between 
the market value of the assets and the present value of the 
accrued pension liabilities is shown as an asset or liability in the 
consolidated balance sheet. The calculation of the present 
value is determined using the projected unit credit method.  
Actuarial gains and losses arising from changes in actuarial 
assumptions together with experience adjustments and actual 
return on assets are recognised in the consolidated statement 
of comprehensive income and expense as they arise. Such 
amounts are not reclassified to the income statement in 
subsequent years. 
Defined benefit costs recognised in the income statement 
comprise mainly net interest expense or income with such 
interest being recognised within finance costs. Net interest is 
calculated by applying the discount rate to the net defined 
benefit liability or asset taking into account any changes in the 
net defined benefit obligation during the year as a result of 
contribution or benefit payments. 
i) Dividends 
Interim dividends are recognised in the year in which they are 
paid. Final dividends are recognised as a liability in the year in 
which they are approved by shareholders. 
j) Leases 
Leases are classified as finance leases whenever the terms of 
the lease transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of 
ownership to the lessee. The determination of the classification 
of property leases is made by reference to the land and 
buildings elements separately. All leases not classified as 
finance leases are classified as operating leases.  
The Group as a lessor 
Rental income from operating leases is recognised on a 
straight-line basis over the term of the relevant lease. Initial 
direct costs incurred in negotiating and arranging an operating 
lease are added to the carrying amount of the leased asset and 
recognised on a straight-line basis over the lease term. 
The Group as a lessee  
Finance leases 
Assets held under finance leases are capitalised at their fair 
value on acquisition or, if lower, at the present value of the 
minimum lease payments, each determined at the inception of 
the lease and depreciated over their estimated useful lives or 
the lease term if shorter. The corresponding obligation to the 
lessor is included in the balance sheet as a liability. Lease 
payments are apportioned between finance charges and 
reduction of the lease obligation. Finance charges are  
charged to the income statement over the term of the lease  
in proportion to the capital element outstanding.   Dixons Carphone plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014/15 
Financial statements
Notes to the Group financial statements 
90 
Operating leases 
Rental payments under operating leases are charged to the 
income statement on a straight-line basis over the period of  
the lease. Contingent rentals arising under operating leases  
are recognised as an expense in the period in which they  
are incurred.  
Benefits received and receivable as an incentive to enter into 
operating leases are amortised through the income statement 
over the period of the lease.  
k) Taxation 
Current tax 
Current tax, is provided at amounts expected to be paid or 
recovered using the prevailing tax rates and laws that have 
been enacted or substantially enacted by the balance  
sheet date and adjusted for any tax payable in respect of 
previous years. 
Deferred tax 
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for all temporary 
differences between the carrying amount of an asset or liability 
in the balance sheet and the tax base value and represent tax 
payable in future periods. Deferred tax assets are recognised 
to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be 
available against which deductible temporary differences can 
be utilised.  
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary 
differences arising on investments in subsidiaries, except 
where the Group is able to control the reversal of the 
temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary 
difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future. No 
provision is made for tax which would have been payable on 
the distribution of retained profits of overseas subsidiaries or 
associated undertakings where it has been determined that 
these profits will not be distributed in the foreseeable future. 
A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is 
probable that future taxable profits will be available against 
which the asset can be utilised. Current and deferred tax is 
recognised in the income statement except where it relates to 
an item recognised directly in reserves, in which case it is 
recognised directly in reserves. 
Deferred tax is measured at the average tax rates that are 
expected to apply in the years in which the timing differences 
are expected to reverse, based on tax rates and laws that  
have been enacted, or substantially enacted by the balance 
sheet date. 
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset against each other 
when they relate to income taxes levied by the same tax 
jurisdiction and when the Group intends to settle its current tax 
assets and liabilities on a net basis. Deferred tax balances are 
not discounted. 
l) Goodwill  
On acquisition of a subsidiary or associate, the fair value of the 
consideration is allocated between the identifiable net tangible 
and intangible assets and liabilities on a fair value basis, with 
any excess consideration representing goodwill. At the 
acquisition date, goodwill is allocated to each Cash Generating 
Unit (CGU) expected to benefit from the combination and held 
in the currency of the operations to which the goodwill relates. 
Goodwill is not amortised, but is reviewed annually for 
impairment, or more frequently where there is an indication 
that goodwill may be impaired. Impairment is assessed by 
measuring the future cash flows of the CGUs to which the 
goodwill relates. Where the future cash flows are less than the 
carrying value of goodwill, an impairment charge is recognised 
in the income statement. 
On disposal of subsidiary undertakings and businesses, the 
relevant goodwill is included in the calculation of the profit or 
loss on disposal. 
m) Intangible assets  
Acquisition intangibles 
Acquisition intangibles comprise brand names and customer 
relationships purchased as part of acquisitions of businesses 
and are capitalised and amortised over their useful economic 
lives on a straight line basis. These intangible assets are stated 
at cost less accumulated amortisation and, where appropriate, 
provision for impairment in value or estimated loss on disposal.  
In respect of customer relationships, the value attributed is 
based on the future economic benefit that is expected to be 
derived from them, calculated as the present value of future 
cash flows after a deduction for contributory assets.  
Amortisation is provided to write off the cost of assets on  
a straight line basis on the following bases: 
Brands 7% to 20% per annum 
Customer relationships 13% to 50% per annum 
 
Software and licences  
Software and licences include costs incurred to acquire the 
assets as well as internal infrastructure and design costs 
incurred in the development of software in order to bring the 
assets into use.  
Internally generated software is recognised as an intangible 
asset only if it can be separately identified, it is probable that 
the asset will generate future economic benefits which exceed 
one year, and the development cost can be measured reliably. 
Where these conditions are not met, development expenditure 
is recognised as an expense in the year in which it is incurred. 
Costs associated with developing or maintaining computer 
software are recognised as an expense as incurred unless they 
increase the future economic benefits of the asset, in which 
case they are capitalised.  
The expenditure capitalised includes the cost of materials, 
direct labour and an appropriate proportion of overheads. 
Subsequent expenditure is capitalised only when it increases 
the future economic benefits embodied in the specific asset to 
which it relates.  
Software is stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and, 
where appropriate, provision for impairment in value or 
estimated loss on disposal. Amortisation is provided to write 
off the cost of assets on a straight line basis between three and 
eight years.   Dixons Carphone plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014/15
Financial statements
 
91 
n) Property, plant & equipment  
Property, plant & equipment are stated at cost less 
accumulated depreciation and any accumulated impairment 
losses.  
With the exception of land, depreciation is provided to write off 
the cost of the assets over their expected useful lives from the 
date the asset was brought into use or capable of being used. 
Rates applied to different classes of property, plant & 
equipment are as follows: 
Land and buildings 1 ⅔% – 4% per annum 
Fixtures, fittings and equipment 10 – 33 ⅓% per annum 
 
Assets capitalised as finance leases are depreciated over the 
term of the lease. 
Property, plant & equipment are assessed on an ongoing basis 
to determine whether circumstances exist that could lead to 
the conclusion that the net book value is not supportable. 
Where assets are to be taken out of use, an impairment charge 
is levied. Where the property, plant & equipment form part of a 
separate CGU, such as a store or group of stores, and 
business indicators exist which could lead to the conclusions 
that the net book value is not supportable, the recoverable 
amount of the CGU is determined by calculating its value in 
use. The value in use is calculated by applying discounted 
cash flow modelling to management’s projection of future 
profitability and any impairment is determined by comparing 
the net book value with the value in use.  
o) Financial assets and investments 
The Group’s financial assets comprise cash and cash 
equivalents, and those receivables which involve a contractual 
right to receive cash from external parties. Financial assets 
comprise all items shown in notes 13 and 14 with the 
exception of prepayments. Under the classifications stipulated 
by IAS 39, cash and cash equivalents and derivative financial 
instruments, which are further described in notes 1r) and 25, 
are classified as ‘loans and receivables’ and ‘held for trading 
unless designated in a hedge relationship’, respectively. Trade 
and other receivables (excluding derivative financial assets) are 
classified as ‘loans and receivables’. 
Investments, other than subsidiaries and joint ventures, are 
initially recognised at cost, being the fair value of the 
consideration given plus any transaction costs associated with 
the acquisition. Investments are categorised as available-for-
sale and are then recorded at fair value. Changes in fair value, 
together with any related taxation, are taken directly to 
reserves, and recycled to the income statement when the 
investment is sold or determined to be impaired. 
p) Interests in joint ventures 
Interests in joint ventures are accounted for using the equity 
method. The consolidated income statement includes the 
Group’s share of the post-tax profits or losses of the joint 
ventures based on their financial statements for the year. In the 
consolidated balance sheet, the Group’s interests in joint 
ventures are shown as a non-current asset in the balance 
sheet, representing the Group’s investment in the share capital 
of the joint ventures, as adjusted by post-acquisition changes 
in the Group’s share of the net assets or liabilities less 
provision for any impairment. Any associated goodwill is 
included within the carrying value of the investment and is 
assessed for impairment as part of that investment. 
Where a joint venture has net liabilities, any loans advanced to 
it are included in the Group’s equity accounted investment in it. 
Where a joint venture has net assets, any loans advanced to it 
are shown separately in the balance sheet, as a receivable to 
the Group. 
q) Inventories 
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable 
value. Cost incorporates any attributable discounts and 
bonuses received from suppliers in respect of that inventory. 
Cost comprises direct purchase cost and those overheads that 
have been incurred in bringing the inventories to their present 
location and condition. Net realisable value is based on 
estimated selling price, less further costs expected to be 
incurred to disposal. Provision is made for obsolete, slow 
moving or defective items where appropriate. 
r) Cash and cash equivalents  
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash at bank and in 
hand, bank overdrafts and short term highly liquid deposits 
with a maturity of three months or less and which are subject 
to an insignificant risk of changes in value. Bank overdrafts, 
which form part of cash and cash equivalents for the purpose 
of the cash flow statement, are shown under current liabilities. 
s) Borrowings and other financial liabilities 
The Group’s financial liabilities are those which involve a 
contractual obligation to deliver cash to external parties at a 
future date. Financial liabilities comprise all items shown in 
notes 15 to 18 with the exception of other taxation and social 
security, deferred income and other non-financial creditors.  
Borrowings  
Borrowings in the Group's balance sheet represent committed 
and uncommitted bank loans. Borrowings are initially recorded 
at the consideration received less directly attributable 
transaction costs. Transaction fees such as bank fees and 
legal costs associated with the securing of financing are 
capitalised and amortised through the income statement over 
the term of the relevant facility. All other borrowing costs are 
recognised in the income statement in the period in which they 
are incurred.    Dixons Carphone plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014/15 
Financial statements
Notes to the Group financial statements 
92 
Under the classifications stipulated by IAS 39, borrowings, 
finance lease obligations and trade and other payables 
(excluding derivative financial liabilities) are classified as 
‘financial liabilities measured at amortised cost’. Derivative 
financial instruments, which are described further in note 25, 
are classified as ‘held for trading unless designated in a  
hedge relationship’. 
Trade and other payables 
Trade and other payables (excluding derivative financial 
liabilities) are recorded at cost. Derivative financial instruments, 
are initially recorded at fair value and then subsequently 
remeasured to fair value at each balance sheet date and are 
held within assets or liabilities as appropriate. Gains and losses 
arising from revaluation at the balance sheet date are 
recognised in the income statement unless the derivatives  
are designated as hedges and such hedges are proved to  
be effective. 
t) Provisions  
Provisions are recognised when a legal or constructive 
obligation exists as a result of past events and it is probable 
that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the 
obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount 
of the obligation. Provisions are discounted where the time 
value of money is considered to be material. 
Provisions fall into the following categories: 
Reorganisation 
Reorganisation provisions relate principally to the costs  
of onerous leases, redundancy costs and other onerous 
contracts, and are only recognised where plans are 
demonstrably committed and where appropriate 
communication to those affected has been undertaken  
at the balance sheet date.  
Sales 
Sales provisions relate to ‘cash-back’ and similar promotions, 
product warranties, product returns, and network operator 
performance penalties. The anticipated costs of these items 
are assessed by reference to historical trends and any other 
information that is considered to be relevant. 
Other 
Other provisions relate mainly to warranties provided in relation 
to business disposals and provisions in respect of the 
expected costs of insurance claims, contingent liabilities 
recognised through business combinations and costs 
associated with onerous contracts.  
All provisions are assessed by reference to the best available 
information at the balance sheet date. 
u) Critical accounting judgements and key sources of  
estimation uncertainty  
Critical accounting estimates and assumptions used in the 
preparation of the financial statements are continually reviewed 
and revised as necessary. 
Whilst every effort is made to ensure that such estimates and 
assumptions are reasonable, by their nature they are uncertain, 
and as such changes in estimates and assumptions may have 
a material impact. The principal items subject to such 
estimates and assumptions are as follows: 
Revenue recognition  
Commission receivable on mobile phone sales depends for 
certain transactions on customer behaviour after the point of 
sale. Assumptions are therefore required, particularly in relation 
to levels of customer default within the contract period, 
expected levels of customer spend, and customer behaviour 
beyond the initial contract period. Such assumptions are based 
on extensive historical evidence, and provision is made for the 
risk of potential changes in customer behaviour. Changes in 
estimates recognised as an increase to revenue may be made, 
where for example more reliable information is available, and 
any such changes are required to be recognised in the income 
statement. Changes of estimates in relation to commission 
receivable after the initial contract term for sales originating in 
previous years totalled £33 million (2013/14: £18 million). The 
total value of ongoing revenues receivable was £629 million 
(2013/14: £525 million). 
Revenue earned from the sale of customer support agreements 
is recognised over the term of the contracts when the Group 
obtains the right to consideration as a result of performance of 
its contractual obligations. Revenue in any one year is 
recognised to match the proportion of the expected costs of 
fulfilling the Group’s total obligations under the agreements.  
An estimate of the degree of performance of these contractual 
obligations is determined by reference to extensive historical 
claims data.  
For both commission receivable on mobile phone sales and 
revenue from customer support agreements, reliance on 
historical data assumes that current and future experience will 
follow past trends. The directors consider that the quantity and 
quality of data available provides an appropriate proxy for 
current trends. 
Income received from suppliers such as volume rebates 
The Group has provided enhanced disclosure on supplier 
funding following guidance issued by the Financial Reporting 
Council in December 2014. This disclosure is aimed at assisting 
the users of the financial statements in understanding the 
judgements and estimates made in the recognition of supplier 
funding in the Group’s financial statements. 
The Group’s agreements with suppliers contain a price for units 
purchased as well as other rebates and discounts which are 
summarised below: 
Volume Rebates: This income is linked to purchases made from 
suppliers and is recognised as a reduction to cost of goods sold 
as inventory is sold. Unearned rebates that relate to inventory 
not sold are recognised within the value of inventory at the 
period end. Where an agreement spans period ends, judgement 
is required regarding amounts to be recognised. Forecasts are 
used as well as historical data in the estimation of the level of 
income recognised. Amounts are only recognised where the 
Group has a clear entitlement to the receipt of the rebate and a 
reliable estimate can be made. 
Discounts: This income is received from suppliers on a price per 
unit basis. The level of estimation is minimal as amounts are 
recognised as a reduction to cost of goods sold based on the 
agreement terms and only once the item is sold.  
Marketing income: This income is received in relation to 
marketing activities that are performed on behalf of suppliers.   Dixons Carphone plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014/15

Judgement is required to ensure that income is only recognised 
when all performance obligations within the contract have been 
fulfilled and the income is expected to be collected. 
Supplier funding amounts that have been recognised and  
not invoiced are shown within accrued income on the  
balance sheet. 
Inventory valuation  
Inventories are valued at the lower cost and net realisable 
value. Cost comprises direct purchase cost and those 
overheads that have been incurred in bringing the inventories 
to their present location and condition. Net realisable value 
represents the estimated selling price less all estimated and 
directly attributable costs of completion and costs to be 
incurred in marketing, selling and distribution. Net realisable 
value includes, where necessary, provisions for slow moving 
and damaged inventory. The provision represents the 
difference between the cost of stock and its estimated net 
realisable value, based on ageing and other factors. 
Calculation of these provisions requires judgements to be 
made which include forecast consumer demand, the 
promotional, competitive and economic environment and 
inventory loss trends. 
Recoverable amount of non-current assets  
All non-current assets, including goodwill and other intangible 
assets, are reviewed for potential impairment using estimates 
of the future economic benefits attributable to them. Any 
estimates of future economic benefits made in relation to non-
current assets may differ from the benefits that ultimately arise 
and materially affect the recoverable value of the asset. The 
methodology used in assessing the carrying value of goodwill 
is set out in note 9 and in respect of intangible assets and 
property, plant & equipment in note 1n). 
Acquisition accounting  
Accounting for the Merger (2013/14: the CPW Europe 
Acquisition) involved the use of assumptions in relation to the 
future cash flows associated with acquisition intangibles, and 
the use of valuation techniques in order to arrive at the fair 
value of the other non-current assets and liabilities acquired. 
The assumptions applied were based on the best information 
available to management and valuation techniques were 
supported by third party valuation experts. Nevertheless, the 
actual performance of these assets and liabilities may differ 
from the valuations derived through this exercise. 
Discontinued operations and assets held for sale 
The disposal of businesses and the recognition of assets held 
for sale at the lower of cost and fair value less costs to sell will 
often require judgement and estimation in relation to the value 
of expected future consideration and costs associated with the 
disposal. Such estimation will be based on the best information 
available up to the approval of the financial statements, but 
nevertheless the final outcomes may vary from that assumed.  
Trade and other receivables  
Provisions for irrecoverable receivables are based on extensive 
historical evidence and the best available information in  
relation to specific issues, but are unavoidably dependent  
on future events. 
Taxation  
Tax laws that apply to the Group’s businesses may be 
amended by the relevant authorities, for example as a result of 
changes in fiscal circumstances or priorities. Such potential 
amendments and their application to the Group are monitored 
regularly and the requirement for recognition of any liabilities 
assessed where necessary. The Group is subject to income 
taxes in a number of different jurisdictions and judgement is 
required in determining the appropriate provision for 
transactions where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. 
In such circumstances, the Group recognises liabilities for 
anticipated taxes due based on best information available and 
where the anticipated liability is probable and estimable. Where 
the final outcome of such matters differs from the amounts 
initially recorded, any differences will impact the income tax 
and deferred tax provisions in the year to which such 
determination is made. Where the potential liabilities are not 
considered probable, the amount at risk is disclosed unless an 
adverse outcome is considered remote. 
Deferred tax is recognised on taxable losses based on the 
expected ability to utilise such losses. This ability takes 
account of the business plans for the relevant companies, 
potential uncertainties around the longer term aspects of these 
business plans, any expiry of taxable benefits and potential 
future volatility in the local tax regimes. 
Provisions 
The Group’s provisions are based on the best information 
available to management at the balance sheet date. However, 
the future costs assumed are inevitably only estimates, which 
may differ from those ultimately incurred. 
Defined benefit pension schemes 
The surplus or deficit in the UK defined benefit pension 
scheme that is recognised through the consolidated statement 
of comprehensive income and expense is subject to a number 
of assumptions and uncertainties. The calculated liabilities of 
the scheme are based on assumptions regarding salary 
increases, inflation rates, discount rates and member longevity. 
Such assumptions are based on actuarial advice and are 
benchmarked against similar pension schemes.

Notes to the Group financial statements 
94 
v) Recent accounting developments  
The Group adopted the following standards during the year, 
none of which have had a material impact on the disclosures or 
amounts reported in the financial statements: 
• IFRS 10 ‘Consolidated Financial Statements’ 
• IFRS 11 ‘Joint Arrangements’ 
• IFRS 12 ‘Disclosure of Interests in Other Entities’ 
• IAS 27 ‘Separate Financial Statements’ 
• IAS 28 ‘Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures’ 
The following new standards, which are applicable to the 
Group, have been published but are not yet effective and have 
not yet been adopted by the EU: 
• IFRS 9 'Financial Instruments'. This standard is the first step 
in the process to replace IAS 39 'Financial Instruments: 
Recognition and Measurement'. IFRS 9 introduces new 
requirements for classifying and measuring financial assets 
and affects the accounting for financial assets. 
• IFRS 15 'Revenue from Contracts with Customers' provides 
guidance on the recognition, timing and measurement of 
revenue. 
IFRS 9 will affect both the measurement and disclosure of 
financial instruments and IFRS 15 may change revenue 
recognition and related disclosures. It is not practicable to 
provide a reasonable estimate of the effect of IFRS 9 and IFRS 
15 until a detailed review has been completed. 
Certain other new accounting standards, amendments to 
existing accounting standards and interpretations which are in 
issue but not yet effective, either do not apply to the Group or 
are not expected to have any material impact on the Group's 
net results or net assets. 
2 Segmental analysis  
The Group’s operating segments reflect the segments routinely 
reviewed by the Board and which are used to manage 
performance and allocate resources. This information is 
predominantly based on geographical areas which are either 
managed separately or have similar trading characteristics 
such that they can be aggregated together into one segment.  
Following the Merger, the Group operates four operating 
segments as described below. Comparative periods have been 
restated to reflect this change.  
As explained in note 24, Virgin Mobile France, the Phone 
House operations in Germany, the Netherlands, Portugal and 
France as well as Dixons’ operations in Czech Republic and 
Slovakia have been treated as discontinued operations and are 
therefore excluded from this segmental analysis. 
The Group’s reportable segments have been identified  
as follows: 
• UK & Ireland comprises operations in the UK and Ireland as 
well as operations in airports in UK and Ireland. 
• Nordics operates in Norway, Sweden, Finland, Denmark and 
Iceland.  
• Southern Europe comprises operations in Spain and Greece.  
• Connected World Services is the Group’s B2B operation 
which leverages the specialist skills, operating processes 
and technology of the Group to provide managed services 
to third parties looking to develop their own connected  
world solutions. 
UK & Ireland, Nordics and Southern Europe are involved in the 
sale of consumer electronics and mobile technology products 
and services, primarily through stores or online channels. 
Transactions between segments are on an arm’s length basis.

 The CPW Europe Acquisition which occurred on 26 June 2013 gave rise to the following exceptional items in the year ended 
29 March 2014: 
• Professional fees of £7 million, costs of £11 million associated with the early vesting of incentive schemes (of which 
£8 million were cash in nature) and a tax credit of £3 million was recognised in respect of these costs. 
• A gain of £1 million resulting from the requirement of the Group to fair value its existing 50% interest in CPW Europe, 
which was considered to be equal to the £500 million gross consideration for Best Buy’s 50% interest. 
• Arrangements with Best Buy allowed the Group to manage the disposal of the Consideration Shares issued to Best Buy, 
and to benefit from any gain on disposal above a share price of £1.90. The Consideration Shares were placed at a price of 
£2.44, resulting in a net cash gain of £23 million for the Group. The gain implied by comparing the share price at 
completion, being £2.38 and £1.90, was treated as an adjustment to consideration and the remaining gain of £2 million 
was recorded in the income statement.   Dixons Carphone plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014/15

 The Dixons Retail Merger is described further in notes 1 and 23. The Merger has given rise to the following costs which have 
been treated as exceptional items: 
• Merger costs comprise banking and professional fees in relation to the transaction. 
• Merger integration costs relate to the reorganisation of the Group following the Merger and comprise the rationalisation of 
certain operational and support functions. These costs mainly comprise professional fees, employee severance and 
property costs associated with the integration process. 
(iv) Share of joint ventures exited – Businesses exited:  
 In light of an increasingly challenging market, the closure of the Phone House France operations was announced in April 
2013. Prior to the CPW Europe Acquisition, when the French operations were part of the CPW Europe joint venture, 
operating losses of £10 million were incurred and restructuring items comprised asset write-downs of £8 million and 
provisions for exit costs of £32 million principally covering redundancies and lease exit costs. A tax credit of £3 million was 
recognised against these items. The Group’s post-tax share of these losses, asset impairments and restructuring costs was 
£23 million. The results of the Phone House France following the CPW Europe Acquisition on 26 June 2013 have been 
classified as discontinued operations following the completion of the closure during the 13 months ended 2 May 2015. 
(v) Net non-cash financing costs on defined benefit pension schemes:  
 Under IAS 19 ‘Employee Benefits’, the net interest charge on defined benefit pension schemes is calculated by applying the 
corporate bond yield rates applicable on the last day of the previous financial year to the net defined benefit obligation. 
Corporate bond yield rates vary over time which in turn creates volatility in the income statement and balance sheet and 
results in a non-cash remeasurement cost which can be volatile due to corporate bond yield rates prevailing on a particular 
day and is also unrepresentative of the actual investment gains or losses made or the liabilities paid and payable. Consistent 
with a number of other companies, the accounting effects of these non-cash revaluations of net defined benefit pension 
liabilities have been excluded from Headline earnings.   Dixons Carphone plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014/15

b) Share-based payments 
i) Share Plan 
During the year ended 29 March 2014, the Group introduced the Share Plan which allows participants to share 10% of the 
incremental value created in the Group in excess of an opening value (assessed on the value of CPW over a three month period 
prior to approval of the plan by shareholders in June 2013 and, for new entrants during the 13 months ended 2 May 2015, 
assessed on the aggregated value of CPW and Dixons Retail over a three month period prior to the announcement of preliminary 
merger discussions in February 2014) and beyond an annual rate of return of 7% on invested capital. The plan is underpinned by 
a minimum annual compound TSR growth of 5% and outperformance of the median TSR of the FTSE 250.  
Participants acquired at market value participation shares in a subsidiary company that holds the Group’s interests in CPW 
Europe and, since the Merger, Dixons Retail. The Group granted loans to participants at a commercial rate of interest to acquire 
the shares. Loans are ordinarily repayable in full if performance conditions are met.  
The performance of the scheme will ordinarily be measured on or around June 2017, when 60% of the shares vest, with 40% 
deferred for a further year. When the awards vest, the value of the shares held by participants will be based on the incremental 
value (if any) of Dixons Carphone in excess of the opening valuation together with the minimum return on invested capital. These 
shares will then be purchased by the Company for cash and / or the Company’s ordinary shares. 
A ‘bad leaver’ will be required to transfer the participation shares to such party as the Company designates for an amount equal 
to the total amount outstanding under the loan. If the market value of the shares is less than the amount of the outstanding loan 
(and any accrued interest) then the participant may be required to repay 20% of the shortfall out of their own resources. 
A participant shall be a ‘good leaver’ at the sole discretion of the Remuneration Committee and may be permitted to retain an 
award notwithstanding the termination of their employment.  
The mechanics of the plan may be varied by the Remuneration Committee if necessary to ensure that participants are neither 
advantaged nor disadvantaged by a variation of the share capital of the Company, bona fide merger, reconstruction or similar 
reorganisation. 
ii) Share option schemes 
During the year ended 29 March 2014, the Group introduced a share option scheme which allows nil-priced options to be 
offered to senior employees who are not participants in the Share Plan.  
Options were first granted under the scheme in January 2014. The options are subject to continuing employment and are subject 
to performance conditions based on a combination of absolute TSR performance and relative TSR performance against the 
FTSE 250 or FTSE 350. 
Following the Merger with Dixons Retail plc on 6 August 2014, the Company assumed the obligation to satisfy outstanding 
Dixons share options awarded under the Retail Employee Share Option Scheme and Executive Share Option Plan, with 
employees eligible to acquire 0.155 Dixons Carphone shares for each Dixons option held. All outstanding Dixons awards had 
vested before the Merger, and were exercisable within six months post Merger. 
Prior to the CPW Europe Acquisition, CPW Europe had a share option scheme, under which participants received options over  
A shares in New CPW and each of Best Buy and the Company had an obligation to acquire 50% of these shares at a value 
based on the Headline PBT of CPW Europe over the vesting period. The pool was based on earnings in excess of minimum 
growth targets, against the earnings for the year ended 31 March 2009. The Company and Best Buy agreed a minimum value  
of the pool, in recognition of the value that had already accrued in the scheme in relation to Best Buy Mobile. 
In order to align the interests of participants with those of the Company, the value of the A shares in New CPW were assessed at 
defined points during the vesting period, and nil-priced options over shares in the Company were granted to participants through 
the Participation Plan to match this value, so that participants benefited from any growth in the market capitalisation of the 
Company during the vesting period. 
Further to the CPW Europe Acquisition the Remuneration Committee allowed the scheme to vest based on performance 
achieved to 31 March 2013. In addition to the Group’s obligations under the scheme the Group also agreed to satisfy Best  
Buy’s obligations under the scheme. During the year ended 29 March 2014, the Company issued 14 million shares in relation  
to these obligations.    Dixons Carphone plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014/15

iii) SAYE scheme 
During the year ended 29 March 2014, the Group introduced a SAYE scheme which allows participants to save up to £500 per 
month for either three or five years. At the end of the savings period participants can purchase shares in the Company based on 
a discounted share price determined at the commencement of the scheme.  
Participants in the Dixons Retail plc SAYE scheme had the opportunity to rollover their awards into options over shares in the 
merged entity, Dixons Carphone, on completion of the Merger. Employees who chose to rollover received 0.155 options in 
Dixons Carphone in exchange for each Dixons option held. The savings period and exercise date of these options remains 
unchanged. If employees chose not to rollover their options, they could exercise the value saved within six months of the Merger 
in return for 0.155 Dixons Carphone shares for each Dixons option held.

b) Share-based payments continued 
iv) Joint venture incentive schemes 
Virgin Mobile France issued market-priced and nil-priced share options in Virgin Mobile France to certain employees of the 
business. These options vested over periods of two to four years. Prior to completion of the disposal of Virgin Mobile France  
on 4 December 2014, these share options were exercised. 
v) Fair value model 
The fair value of options with external performance targets was estimated at the date of grant using a Monte Carlo model.  
The model combines the market price of a share at the date of grant with the probability of meeting performance criteria, based 
on the historical performance of Carphone Warehouse and Old Carphone Warehouse shares and, for options issued subsequent 
to the Merger on 6 August 2014, the historical performance of Dixons. 
The weighted average fair value of options granted during the period was £1.62 (2013/14: £0.84). The following table lists the

vi) Charge to the income statement and entries in reserves  
During the 13 months ended 2 May 2015, the Group recognised a non-cash accounting charge to profit and loss of £10 million 
(2013/14: £4 million) in respect of equity settled share-based payments, which is offset by an entry through reserves. This entry  
is offset in reserves by the non-recourse element of loans provided to participants in the Carphone Warehouse Share Plan.

The effective tax rate on Headline earnings of 24% (2013/14: 20%) has increased compared to the prior year due mainly to an 
increase in the proportion of taxable profits arising in higher rate jurisdictions, predominantly the Nordics. 
Items attracting no tax relief or liability relate primarily to non-deductible lease exit costs (2013/14: related primarily to French 
operations).

b) Goodwill impairment testing  
As required by IAS 36, goodwill is subject to annual impairment reviews. These reviews are carried out using the following 
criteria: 
• business acquisitions generate an attributed amount of goodwill;  
• the manner in which these businesses are run and managed is used to determine the CGU grouping as defined in IAS 36 
‘Impairment of Assets’; 
• the recoverable amount of each CGU group is determined based on calculating its value in use (VIU); 
• the VIU is calculated by applying discounted cash flow modelling to management’s own projections covering a five year 
period; 
• cash flows beyond the five year period are extrapolated using a long term growth rate equivalent to long term forecasts of 
Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth rates for the relevant market; and 
• the VIU is then compared to the carrying amount in order to determine whether impairment has occurred.  
The key assumptions used in calculating value in use are: 
• management’s projections; 
• the growth rate beyond five years; and  
• the pre-tax discount rate.  
The long term projections, which have been approved by management, have been prepared using three year strategic plans as  
a base extrapolated to five years and which have regard to the relative performance of competitors and knowledge of the current 
market together with management’s views on the future achievable growth in market share and impact of the committed 
initiatives. The cash flows which derive from these five year projections include ongoing capital expenditure required to develop 
and upgrade the store network in order to maintain and operate the businesses and to compete in their markets. In forming the 
five year projections, management draws on past experience as a measure to forecast future performance. 
Key assumptions used in determining the five year projections comprise the growth in sales and costs over this period. The 
compound annual growth rate in sales and costs can rise as well as fall year on year depending not only on the year five targets,  
but also on the current financial year base. These targets, when combined, accordingly drive the resulting profit margins and the 
profit in year five of the projections which is in turn used to calculate the terminal value in the VIU calculation. Historical amounts  
for the businesses under impairment review as well as from other parts of the Group are used to generate the values attributed  
to these assumptions. 
The value attributed to these assumptions for the most significant components of goodwill are as follows:

Nordics 4.9% 4.8% 2.2% 8.5% — — — — 
 
Growth rates used were determined based on third party long term growth rate forecasts and are based on the GDP growth rate 
for the territories in which the businesses operate. The pre-tax discount rates applied to the forecast cash flows reflect current 
market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the CGUs. 
c) Goodwill impairment sensitivity analysis  
A sensitivity analysis has been performed on each of the base case assumptions used for assessing the goodwill with other 
variables held constant. Consideration of sensitivities to key assumptions can evolve from one financial year to the next.  
The directors have concluded that there are no reasonably likely changes in key assumptions which would cause the carrying 
amount of goodwill to exceed its value in use.    Dixons Carphone plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014/15

Freehold land and buildings predominantly comprise the Group’s investment property. The fair value of investment property was 
determined by an external, independent property valuation expert as £14 million (2014: £22 million). The valuation expert has 
appropriate recognised professional qualifications as well as recent experience in the location and category of the properties 
being valued. The valuation of properties was performed by reference to appropriate yield rates and market evidence of recent 
transactions. Future minimum lease income in respect of the Group’s investment properties are set out in note 29.

Committed facilities 
Until the Merger, the Group had a £650 million multi-currency term and revolving credit facility which matured in April 2017. This 
facility was split into two tranches: a £400 million revolving tranche and a term loan tranche of £250 million. The term loan facility 
reduced by £25 million during the year ended 2 May 2015 and amortises by a further £50 million on 30 June 2016. 
These facilities were amended on completion of the Merger for specific requirements of Dixons, a temporary loosening of certain 
covenants and some other provisions specific to the Merger, but which otherwise remained on the same terms as previously 
agreed and will still mature in April 2017. In addition, the Company arranged a new £250 million revolving credit facility maturing 
on 29 April 2017.  
The rate of interest payable on borrowings is a margin of 1.5% to 2.25% per annum over LIBOR or EURIBOR. 
The facilities require guarantees to be provided by certain Group entities under the facilities. 
Bank overdraft and other uncommitted facilities  
The Group has overdraft and uncommitted money market facilities totalling approximately £157 million (2014: £95 million).

Retirement benefit obligations – UK 486 — 
    – Nordics 3 — 
 489 — 
 
The Group operates a defined benefit and a number of defined contribution schemes which were acquired as part of the Dixons 
Retail Merger. 
The principal scheme which operates in the UK includes a funded defined benefit section whose assets are held in a separate 
trustee administered fund. The scheme is valued by a qualified actuary at least every three years and contributions are assessed  
in accordance with the actuary’s advice. Since 1 September 2002, the defined benefit section of the scheme has been closed to  
new entrants and on 30 April 2010 was closed to future accrual with automatic entry into the defined contribution section being 
offered to those active members of the defined benefit section at that time. Membership of the defined contribution section is  
offered to eligible employees. 
In the Nordics division, the Group operates small funded secured defined benefit pension schemes, which are also closed  
to new entrants, with assets held by a life insurance company as well as an unsecured pension arrangement. In addition, 
contributions are made to state pension schemes with defined benefit characteristics. There has been a net movement in  
the obligation since the Merger and this principally relates to an actuarial loss of £1 million. 
a) Defined contribution pension schemes 
The pension charge in respect of defined contribution schemes was £20 million (2013/14: £4 million). 
b) UK Defined benefit pension scheme – actuarial valuation and assumptions 
A full actuarial valuation of the scheme was last carried out as at 31 March 2013 and showed a shortfall of assets compared with 
liabilities of £373 million. A ‘recovery plan’ based on this valuation was agreed with the Trustee post the Dixons Retail Merger 
such that contributions in respect of the scheme year end of 31 March of £25 million were made in 2014/15, rising to £35 million 
for 2015/16. Contributions rise to £47 million by 2024/25. The next triennial valuation will be as at 31 March 2016. 
The principal actuarial assumptions as at 31 March 2013 were: 
  Rate per annum
Discount rate for accrued benefits
†
 – Growth portfolio 5.9% 
 – Matching portfolio 3.8% 
Rate of increase to pensions   0% – 3.8% 
Inflation  3.4% 
 
† The discount rate is based on a linear de-risking methodology which assumes the Scheme’s investment strategy switches investments from 
growth assets (such as equities) to matching assets (such as bonds) over a period of 30 years from 2013 to 2043 so that in 30 years’ time 
the asset portfolio is projected to be 80% invested in matching assets.  
 
At 31 March 2013, the market value of the scheme’s investments was £812 million and, based on the above assumptions,  
the value of the assets was sufficient to cover 69% of the benefits accrued to members with the liabilities amounting to  
£1,185 million.   Dixons Carphone plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014/15

c) UK Defined benefit pension scheme – IAS 19 
The following summarises the components of net defined benefit expense recognised in the consolidated income statement,  
the funded status and amounts recognised in the consolidated balance sheet and other amounts recognised in the statement  
of comprehensive income. The methodologies set out in IAS 19 are different from those used by the scheme actuaries in 
determining funding arrangements. 
(i) Principal assumptions adopted 
The assumptions used in calculating the expenses and obligations are set by the directors after consultation with the 
independent actuaries.

The Group uses demographic assumptions underlying the last formal actuarial valuation of the scheme as at 31 March 2013.  
In particular, post retirement mortality has been assumed to follow the standard mortality tables ‘S1’ All Pensioners tables 
published by the CMI, based on the experience of Self-Administered Pension Schemes (SAPS) with multipliers of 100% for 
males and 105% for females. In addition, an allowance has been made for future improvements in longevity from 2003 by using 
the new CMI 2013 Core projections with a long term rate of improvement of 1.5% per annum for men and 1.25% per annum for 
women. Applying such tables results in an average expected longevity of between 87.1 years and 88.8 years for men and 
between 88.8 years and 90.2 years for women for those reaching 65 over the next 15 years.

20 Retirement and other post-employment benefit obligations continued 
The investment strategy of the scheme is determined by the independent Trustee through advice provided by an independent 
investment consultant. The scheme invests in a diverse range of asset classes as set out above with matching assets primarily 
comprising holdings in inflation linked gilts and corporate bonds. 
Actual return on the scheme assets was a gain of £111 million (2013/14: £nil). 
v) Sensitivities  
The value of the UK defined benefit pension scheme assets are sensitive to market conditions, particularly equity values which 
comprise approximately 67% of the scheme’s assets. Changes in assumptions used for determining retirement benefit costs 
and liabilities may have a material impact on the 2015/16 income statement and the balance sheet. The main assumptions are 
the discount rate, the rate of inflation and the assumed mortality rate. The following table provides an estimate of the potential 
impacts of each of these variables if applied to the current year consolidated income statement and balance sheet.

d) Other post-employment benefits – IAS 19 
The Group offers other post-employment benefits to employees in overseas territories, in particular in Greece. These benefits are 
unfunded. At 2 May 2015 the net obligation in relation to these benefits was £3 million (2014: £nil). The net movement in the 
obligation (since the Merger) is not significant.

23 Merger and acquisition 
2014/15: All-share merger of Dixons and Carphone  
On 6 August 2014, the Group completed an all-share merger of Dixons and Carphone after which the shareholders of Dixons 
and Carphone each held 50% of Dixons Carphone on a fully diluted basis taking into account existing share options and award 
schemes for both companies.  
Under the terms of the Merger, Dixons shareholders received 0.155 of a new Dixons Carphone Share in exchange for each 
Dixons share. In accordance with the criteria in IFRS 3 ‘Business Combinations’ it has been determined that Carphone  
acquired Dixons. 
The merged entity creates a leader in European consumer electricals, mobiles, connectivity and related services. The directors 
believe that the Merger will deliver significant value to shareholders through a combination of enhanced commercial 
opportunities, operating synergies and growth opportunities. The integration of the two businesses is being managed by a 
dedicated integration team, bringing together the best relevant capabilities of both businesses, with the aim of facilitating a 
smooth integration.

sublet to third parties and legal claims. It is anticipated that the majority of any utilisation associated with these contingent liabilities will be 
incurred over the next five years. No utilisation of these provisions has occurred between the acquisition date and 2 May 2015. 
(iv) The finalisation of the fair value of the acquired assets and liabilities will be completed within 12 months of the acquisition and therefore 
remains provisional until 5 August 2015 owing to the extensive nature of the valuation process as well as the requirement to re-assess  
the status of contingent liabilities which have been provided for. It is therefore possible that adjustments to goodwill could arise up until  
5 August 2015.  
(v) The goodwill arising on acquisition is not deductible for income tax purposes. The provisional goodwill of £2,629 million reflects the fact that 
Dixons’ value is based on its cash generating potential rather than its existing assets and the fact that many of its key strengths, such as its 
scale and expertise, do not represent intangible assets as defined by IFRS. The goodwill furthermore reflects the main reasons the directors 
of Dixons and Carphone proposed the Merger, being: 
• The markets in which Carphone and Dixons operate are converging and the combination of the two complementary businesses will create 
the opportunity for compelling end-to-end propositions and long term relationships with customers; 
• The Group will have improved scale and reach; 
• Significant synergies will arise with operating synergies of at least £80 million on a recurring basis expected to be delivered in full by 
2016/17; and 
• The Merger will provide a stronger platform for growth through the provision of services to customers and businesses.  
(vi) On 6 August 2014 the Company issued 574,723,226 shares with a mid-market share price of £3.432 as consideration to Dixons 
shareholders, resulting in an increase to share capital and share premium of £1,972 million. In addition, the Company assumed the 
obligation to satisfy outstanding share options within the Dixons Carphone business for which a fair value of £11 million has been  
included as part of the consideration. This has been partially offset by shares with a value of £1 million included within Dixons Retail 
Employee Share Trust. 
 
b) Other information 
Transaction related charges of £9 million incurred by the Group in respect of the Merger have been included in Non-Headline 
operating expenses as set out in note 4. 
The results of Dixons have been consolidated from 6 August 2014, contributing £5,586 million of revenue and profit after tax  
of £200 million in the period to 2 May 2015. If the acquisition had completed at the beginning of Dixons’ financial year, being  
1 May 2014, the Group’s revenue would have been £9,936 million and the Group’s Headline profit after tax would have been 
£293 million. Non-Headline items included within Dixons results in the period prior to the Merger comprised £11 million in 
respect of the acceleration of share-based payment charges which vested on the Merger, £12 million of merger related 
professional fees, £5 million of merger integration costs, £42 million of debt restructuring costs, £5 million of provision releases 
relating to discontinued operations and £4 million of pension interest costs. A tax credit of £11 million was recognised against 
these charges.   Dixons Carphone plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014/15

2013/14 CPW Europe Acquisition  
On 26 June 2013 the Group completed the CPW Europe Acquisition for a gross consideration of £500 million, bringing the 
Group’s ownership interest to 100%. CPW Europe is one of the largest independent telecommunications specialists in Europe, 
operating retail stores, principally under the Carphone Warehouse and Phone House brands, together with well-developed online 
propositions. CPW Europe is also increasingly focused on leveraging its assets and expertise to provide services to third parties 
through its Connected World Services business. 
The primary reasons for the acquisition were to bring a simplified ownership structure, making day-to-day management easier 
and the strategic decision-making process more streamlined, and enabling the Group to better leverage CPW Europe’s asset 
base and know-how.  
c) Fair value of assets and liabilities 
The fair values of identifiable assets and liabilities of CPW Europe as at the acquisition date were as follows: 
 Notes £million
Intangible assets  120 
Property, plant and equipment  72 
Deferred tax assets  44 
Stock  343

23 Merger and acquisition continued 
2013/14 CPW Europe Acquisition continued 
 (i) The fair value of trade and other receivables represents gross contractual amounts receivable of £1,135 million, less amounts not 
considered collectable of £23 million. 
(ii) Provisions include the recognition of contingent liabilities of £8 million in relation to legal claims and other potential exposures. It is expected 
that any costs associated with these contingent liabilities will be incurred over the next four years. 
(iii) The goodwill of £484 million arising on the acquisition reflects the fact that CPW Europe’s value is based on its cash generating potential 
rather than its existing assets, and the fact that many of its key strengths, such as its scale and expertise, do not represent intangible assets 
as defined by IFRS. None of the goodwill is expected to be deductible for income tax purposes. 
(iv) IFRS 3 ‘Business Combinations’ requires that the Group’s existing 50% interest in CPW Europe be revalued to its fair value as part of the 
acquisition accounting process. The fair value of this interest is considered to be equal to the gross consideration of £500 million paid by the 
Group to acquire Best Buy’s 50% interest in CPW Europe. As the carrying value of the Group’s investment in CPW Europe was £499 million 
at the acquisition date, a gain of £1 million was recognised in Non-Headline operating expenses in respect of this revaluation. 
(v) Gross cash consideration of £370 million was settled on completion, offset by payments from Best Buy of £29 million in respect of the 
prepayment or termination of the Group’s other interests with Best Buy. 
(vi) The £50 million of deferred cash consideration, which bears interest at 2.5% per annum, is payable to Best Buy in two equal instalments of 
£25 million in June 2014 and June 2015. 
(vii) A further £80 million of consideration was provided through the issue on completion of 42.1 million shares to Best Buy, at a price of £1.90 
per share. The Group had the right to place the Consideration Shares on Best Buy’s behalf during the 12 month period to June 2014, and to 
retain any upside on disposal. The value of the Consideration Shares on completion was £101 million, based on a share price at that date of 
£2.38, and this value is recorded as consideration, with the value associated with the right to place the Consideration Shares recognised as 
a derivative financial asset of £21 million. The Consideration Shares were placed in July 2013 at an average price of £2.44, resulting in a net 
cash gain of £23 million for the Group. The difference between the disposal proceeds and the value of the derivative financial asset has 
been recognised as a gain of £2 million in Non-Headline operating expenses. 
 
As part of the transaction, the Group agreed to satisfy Best Buy’s obligations in relation to certain incentive schemes. Shares 
with a value of £12 million were issued in respect of Best Buy’s obligations and have been included in consideration. 
d) Other information 
The results of CPW Europe have been consolidated into the Group’s income statement from 26 June 2013, contributing  
£2,561 million of revenue and a profit before tax of £61 million in the period to 29 March 2014. If the acquisition had completed 
on 1 April 2013, being the first day of the financial year, the Group’s revenue would have been £3,402 million and the Group’s 
profit before tax would have been £46 million. 
Transaction-related charges of £18 million, comprising banking and professional fees of £7 million and cash and non-cash 
charges relating to incentive schemes of £11 million have been included in Non-Headline operating expenses. A tax credit of  
£3 million was also recognised in respect of these costs. 
e) Share of results from joint ventures 
The Group’s share of results of joint ventures within continuing operations relate to CPW Europe prior to its acquisition on  
26 June 2013 and is analysed as follows: 
 
29 March 
2014

† Headline EBIT includes the unwinding of discounting for the time value of money on network commissions receivable over the life of the 
customer. This unwinding had a value of £3 million for the period to 26 June 2013 and is treated as finance income in the joint venture’s 
statutory results.   Dixons Carphone plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014/15

24 Discontinued operations and assets held for sale  
On 16 May 2014 the Group announced that it had entered into an agreement to sell its interest in Virgin Mobile France 
and completed the disposal on 4 December 2014 for gross consideration of £104 million and generated a profit of  
£87 million. 
Following the Merger, the Group put in place a strategy of focusing on market leadership positions while engaging in 
other markets through partnerships with its Connected World Services division. This led the Group to carry out detailed 
strategic assessments of its Phone House operations which concluded in the decision to exit certain markets. 
• On 15 April 2015 the Group announced that it had agreed the sale of its operations in Germany to Drillisch AG, a leading 
mobile virtual network operator in Germany. The sale completed on 5 May 2015. 
• On 24 April 2015 the Group entered into an agreement to dispose of a majority 83% stake in its operations in the Netherlands 
to Relevant Holdings BV, a company set up by the shareholders of Optie1 which has extensive telecom retailing experience in 
the Dutch market. The sale completed on 30 June 2015. 
• On 16 July 2015 the Group announced its commitment to dispose of its operations in Portugal following the completion of a 
strategic review in 2014/15. Discussions which commenced with potential acquirers during 2014/15 are advanced and an 
announcement confirming details of the disposal is expected in due course.  
The closure of the Phone House operations in France, which was announced in 2013/14, was completed during the year 
ended 2 May 2015 and is therefore now treated as a discontinued operation. 
Prior to the Merger, Dixons agreed to sell its operations in the Czech Republic and Slovakia. The net assets held for sale 
associated with this business were included within the fair value of assets and liabilities acquired through the Merger and 
the sale completed on 11 August 2014. 
All businesses noted above have been presented within discontinued operations and the assets and liabilities associated 
with Germany, Netherlands and Portugal have been recognised as held for sale at 2 May 2015. The results of the Phone 
House Germany, Netherlands and Portugal prior to the CPW Europe Acquisition continue to be reported in results of joint 
ventures within Headline continuing operations. The Group’s interest in Virgin Mobile France was presented as an asset 
held for sale as at 29 March 2014 and equity accounting was ceased from this date.

The profit on disposal of Virgin Mobile France comprises consideration of £104 million, £4 million of costs and £13 million of net 
assets disposed. The loss before tax of the operations in Germany, the Netherlands and Portugal include restructuring costs and 
asset impairment charges from reorganisations carried out prior to the businesses being classified as held for sale. Such costs 
include the Non-Headline exceptional restructuring charges of £67 million, of which £35 million relates to goodwill impairment, 
recognised in relation to the Phone House Germany and Netherlands. The impairment losses recognised on classification as 
held for sale on all other businesses reflects the difference between the consideration expected to be received and the net 
assets held for sale including any impairment of assets to their anticipated net realisable value on completion less any accrued 
costs to sell.  Dixons Carphone plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014/15

25 Financial risk management and derivative financial instruments 
Financial instruments that are measured at fair value in the financial statements require disclosure of fair value measurements  
by level based on the following fair value measurement hierarchy: 
• Level 1 – quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets and liabilities; 
• Level 2 – inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability either directly  
(that is, as prices) or indirectly (that is, derived from prices); and 
• Level 3 – inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (that is, unobservable inputs). 
The significant inputs required to fair value all of the Group’s financial instruments are observable. The Group only holds Level 2 
financial instruments. There have also been no transfers of assets or liabilities between levels of the fair value hierarchy. 
Fair values have been arrived at by discounting future cash flows, assuming no early redemption, or by revaluing forward 
currency contracts and interest rate swaps to period end market rates as appropriate to the instrument. 
The directors consider that the book value of financial assets and liabilities recorded at amortised cost and their fair value are 
approximately equal. 
The book value and fair value of the Group’s financial assets, liabilities and derivative financial instruments are as follows: 
 
2 May 
 2015 
£million 
29 March
 2014

a) Financial risk management policies 
The Group’s activities expose it to certain financial risks including market risk (such as foreign exchange risk and interest rate 
risk), credit risk and liquidity risk. The Group’s treasury function, which operates under treasury policies approved by the Board, 
uses certain financial instruments to mitigate potentially adverse effects on the Group’s financial performance from these risks. 
These financial instruments consist of bank loans and deposits, spot and forward foreign exchange contracts, foreign exchange 
swaps and interest rate swaps.  
Throughout the period under review, in accordance with Group policy, no speculative use of derivatives, foreign exchange or 
other instruments was permitted. No contracts with embedded derivatives have been identified and, accordingly, no such 
derivatives have been accounted for separately.   Dixons Carphone plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014/15
Financial statements
 
131 
25 Financial risk management and derivative financial instruments continued 
b) Foreign exchange risk 
The Group undertakes certain transactions that are denominated in foreign currencies and as a consequence has exposure to 
exchange rate fluctuations. These exposures primarily arise from inventory purchases, with most of the Group’s exposure being 
to US Dollar and Euro fluctuations. The Group uses spot and forward currency contracts to mitigate these exposures, with such 
contracts designed to cover exposures ranging from one month to one year.  
The translation risk on converting overseas currency profits or losses is not hedged and such profits or losses are converted into 
Sterling at average exchange rates throughout the year. The Group’s principal translation currency exposures are the Euro and 
Norwegian Krone.  
At 2 May 2015, the total notional principal amount of outstanding currency contracts was £1,540 million (2014: £68 million). 
Monetary assets and liabilities and foreign exchange contracts are sensitive to movements in foreign exchange rates. This 
sensitivity can be analysed in comparison to year-end rates (assuming all other variables remain constant) as follows:

10% movement in the Danish Krone exchange rate — 3 — — 
10% movement in the Norwegian Krone exchange rate — 3 — — 
 
c) Interest rate risk 
The Group’s interest rate risk arises primarily on cash, cash equivalents and loans and other borrowings, all of which are at 
floating rates of interest and which therefore expose the Group to cash flow interest rate risk. These floating rates are linked to 
LIBOR and other interest rate bases as appropriate to the instrument and currency. Future cash flows arising from these financial 
instruments depend on interest rates and periods agreed at the time of rollover. Group policy permits the use of long term 
interest rate derivatives in managing the risks associated with movements in interest rates. 
The effect on the income statement and equity of 1% movements in the interest rate for the currencies in which most Group 
cash, cash equivalents, loans and other borrowings are denominated and on which the valuation of most derivative financial 
instruments is based is as follows, assuming that the year-end positions prevail throughout the year:

d) Liquidity risk 
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will encounter difficulty in meeting the obligations associated with its financial liabilities 
that are settled by delivering cash or another financial asset. The Group manages its exposure to liquidity risk by reviewing 
regularly the long term and short term cash flow projections for the business against the resources available to it.  
In order to ensure that sufficient funds are available for ongoing and future developments, the Group has committed bank 
facilities, excluding overdrafts repayable on demand, totalling £875 million (2014: £650 million). Further details of committed 
borrowing facilities are shown in note 17. 
The table below analyses the Group’s financial liabilities and derivative assets and liabilities into relevant maturity groupings.  
The amounts disclosed in the table are the contractual undiscounted cash flows, including both principal and interest flows, 
assuming that interest rates remain constant and that borrowings are paid in full in the year of maturity.

25 Financial risk management and derivative financial instruments continued 
e) Credit risk 
Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a bank fails to meet its contractual obligations, and arises principally from 
the Group’s receivables from customers. The Group’s exposure to credit risk is regularly monitored and the Group’s policy is 
updated as appropriate.  
The majority of the Group’s trade receivables are balances due from MNOs, which are generally major multi-national enterprises 
with whom the Group has well-established relationships and are consequently not considered to add significantly to the Group’s 
credit risk exposure. The Group's trade receivables also include balances due from equipment manufacturers, dealers and 
Connected World Services customers, business to business customers and consumer credit receivables. Where it is considered 
appropriate, the Group obtains credit insurance on accounts receivable. Provision is made for any receivables that are 
considered to be irrecoverable. Details of trade receivables which are past due but not impaired are provided in note 13. 
The credit risks on cash and cash equivalents and derivative financial instruments are closely monitored and credit ratings are 
used in determining maximum counterparty credit risk.  
The Group’s funding is reliant on its £875 million bank facilities, which are provided by nine banks; these institutions are 
considered to be adequately capitalised to continue to meet their obligations under the facility. 
The carrying amount of financial assets recorded in the financial statements, which is net of impairment losses, represents the 
Group's maximum exposure to credit risk. 
f) Capital risk 
The Group manages its capital to ensure that entities within the Group will be able to continue as going concerns, whilst 
maximising the return to shareholders through a suitable mix of debt and equity. The capital structure of the Group consists of 
cash and cash equivalents, loans and other borrowings and equity attributable to equity holders of the Company, comprising 
issued capital, reserves and accumulated profits. Except in relation to minimum capital requirements in its insurance business, 
the Group is not subject to any externally imposed capital requirements. The Group monitors its capital structure on an ongoing 
basis, including assessing the risks associated with each class of capital. 
g) Derivatives 
Derivative financial instruments comprise forward foreign exchange contracts, foreign exchange swaps and interest rate swaps. 
The Group has designated financial instruments under IAS 39 as follows: 
Cash flow hedges 
At 2 May 2015 the Group had forward and swap foreign exchange contracts in place with a notional value of £1,487 million 
(2014: £nil) that were designated and effective as cash flow hedges. These contracts are expected to cover exposures ranging 
from one month to one year.  
Interest rate swaps 
The Group also held interest rate swaps with a notional value of £280 million (2014: £280 million) whereby the Group receives  
a floating rate of interest based on LIBOR and pays a fixed interest rate. This contract matures in April 2017.

Notes to the Company financial statements 
138 
C1 Accounting policies 
a) Basis of preparation 
The Company is incorporated in the United Kingdom. The financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis 
(see note 1 to the Group financial statements) and in accordance with applicable United Kingdom accounting standards under 
the historical cost convention, as modified by FRS 26 ‘Financial Instruments: Measurement’. 
Historically, the Company has prepared its financial statements to the Saturday closest to its accounting reference date of  
31 March. Following the Dixons Retail Merger, which is described further in note 23 to the Group financial statements, the 
Company has changed its accounting reference date to 30 April which was the pre-existing accounting reference date of Dixons 
Retail plc, but will continue to draw up accounts to the nearest Saturday and accordingly the financial period is for the 13 months 
ended 2 May 2015. The comparative period is for the year ended 29 March 2014.  
The Company has applied the exemption available in FRS 1 ‘Cash Flow Statements’ not to present its own cash flow statement. 
The following principal accounting policies have been applied consistently throughout both financial periods. 
b) Investments 
Investments held in subsidiaries and joint ventures are recognised at cost, being the fair value of consideration, acquisition 
charges associated with the investment and capital contributions by way of share-based payments, less any provision for 
permanent diminution in value. 
Investments where the Company does not have control or significant influence are treated as available-for-sale and recorded at 
fair value. Changes in fair value, together with any related deferred taxation, are taken directly to reserves, and recycled to the 
profit and loss account when the investment is sold or is determined to be impaired. 
c) Share-based payments  
Equity settled share-based payments are measured at fair value at the date of grant and expensed over the vesting period, 
based on an estimate of the number of shares that will eventually vest. 
Fair value is measured by use of a Binomial model for share-based payments with internal performance criteria (such as EPS 
targets) and a Monte Carlo model for those with external performance criteria (such as TSR targets). 
For schemes with internal performance criteria, the number of options expected to vest is recalculated at each balance sheet 
date, based on expectations of performance against target and of leavers prior to vesting. The movement in cumulative expense 
since the previous balance sheet date is recognised in the profit and loss account, with a corresponding entry in reserves. 
For schemes with external performance criteria, the number of options expected to vest is adjusted only for expectations of 
leavers prior to vesting. The movement in cumulative expense since the previous balance sheet date is recognised in the profit 
and loss account, with a corresponding entry in reserves. 
If a share-based payment scheme is cancelled, any remaining part of the fair value of the scheme is expensed through the profit 
and loss account. If a share-based payment scheme is forfeited, no further expense is recognised and any charges previously 
recognised through the profit and loss account are reversed. 
Charges also arise on loans that are provided to employees to fund the purchase of shares in the Group as part of long term 
incentive plans, to the extent to which the loans are not, in certain circumstances, repayable; the cost of the relevant part of such 
loans is expensed over the course of the relevant incentive plans. 
d) Dividends  
Dividends receivable from the Company’s subsidiaries are recognised only when they are approved by shareholders. 
Final dividend distributions to the Company’s shareholders are recognised as a liability in the financial statements in the year in 
which they are approved by the Company’s shareholders. Interim and other dividends are recognised in the year in which they 
are paid. 
e) Foreign currency translation 
Material transactions in foreign currencies are hedged using forward purchases or sales of the relevant currencies and are 
recognised in the financial statements at the exchange rates thus obtained. Unhedged transactions are recorded at the 
exchange rate on the date of the transaction. Material monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are 
hedged, mainly using forward foreign exchange contracts to create matching liabilities and assets, and are retranslated at each 
balance sheet date. Hedge accounting as defined by FRS 26 has been applied in the both years. 
f) Loans and other borrowings 
Bank fees and legal costs associated with the securing of external financing are capitalised and amortised over the term of the 
relevant facility. All other borrowing costs are recognised in the profit and loss account in the period in which they are incurred.   Dixons Carphone plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014/15
Financial statements
 
139 
C1 Accounting policies continued 
g) Provisions 
Provisions are recognised when a legal or constructive obligation exists as a result of past events and it is probable that an 
outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation. 
Provisions are discounted where the time value of money is considered to be material. 
C2 Profit and loss account 
In accordance with the exemption permitted by section 408 of the Companies Act 2006, the profit and loss account of the 
Company is not presented separately. The profit recognised for the 13 months ended 2 May 2015 was £64 million (2013/14:  
£19 million). Information regarding the audit fees for the Group is provided in note 3 to the Group financial statements.

Fixed asset investments comprise investments in subsidiary undertakings, joint venture investments and other minority 
investments. Details of the Company’s investments in subsidiary undertakings are provided in note C12. 
2014/15:  
On 6 August 2014, the Group completed an all-share merger of Dixons and Carphone after which the shareholders of Dixons 
and Carphone each held 50% of Dixons Carphone on a fully diluted basis taking into account existing share options and award 
schemes for both companies.  
Under the terms of the Merger, Dixons shareholders received 0.155 of a new Dixons Carphone Share in exchange for each 
Dixons share. In accordance with the criteria in IFRS 3 ‘Business Combinations’ it has been determined that Carphone acquired 
Dixons and accounts for the majority of the additions listed. Immediately following the Merger, the shareholding in Dixons was 
transferred down to the Company’s immediate subsidiary, New CPW Limited, and this transaction accounts for the majority of 
the disposals. 
2013/14:  
Additions reflected the cost of shares issued to satisfy Best Buy’s obligations in relation to incentive schemes (see note 23 to the 
Group financial statements).   Dixons Carphone plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014/15
