branding and 
relaunch
Stock 84 is one of the flagship brands of 
the Stock Spirits portfolio with over 130 
years of heritage, founded by visionary 
Lionello Stock, who first produced his 
own Italian brandy in 1884. 
Throughout its history, Stock 84 has been available in 24 countries across 
the world, with variations to its range, packaging and branding over time. 
This redesign brings a renewed consistency to the product range globally, 
whilst giving it a fresher and more modern look. 
Stock Spirits conducted exhaustive market research to ensure the redesign 
was in line with consumers’ high expectations for Stock 84, working with 
leading Italian design agencies on the redesign project. The new bottle 
stays faithful to the traditional Stock 84 silhouette, but with a modern 
twist that adds a premium feel.

Strategy in action Looking to the future with 
a stronger base
Chairman’s statement
As Chairman of Stock Spirits Group PLC, I am pleased to present our 
Annual Report and Accounts for the year ended 31 December 2017.
After a year of great change in 2016, the Group 
entered 2017 with a significantly strengthened and 
experienced Board and Executive team who have a 
strong commitment to turning round the fortunes 
of the business. 2017 was a year of stabilisation for 
Stock Spirits, embedding the significant changes 
accomplished in 2016 whilst continuing to address 
the competitive challenges that remain in our 
markets, particularly that of our largest market, 
Poland. We believe we have stabilised in this market 
and the local management team continues to drive 
through change and improvements.
While the Board’s major focus remained on 
returning our Polish business to growth, we also 
considered the Group’s future wider priorities. 
A comprehensive review of the Group’s strategy 
was carried out in the latter half of the year. The 
chief conclusion from this process was that our 
strategy as outlined at the time of the IPO remains 
as relevant as ever. However, to achieve our goals 
we need to respond better to developments and 
changes in our key markets; to execute those 
plans more effectively and to focus more on the 
ultimate consumers of our products, rather than 
just on internal KPIs. The major focus of our 
updated strategy, therefore, is to concentrate on 
our largest value drivers, our brands. Mirek will 
cover the detail of our conclusions and plans more 
thoroughly in his Chief Executive’s Report.
Given our operational progress we are better able 
to return to the other key element of our IPO 
strategy which is growth through mergers and 
acquisitions (M&A).
During 2017, we continued to review ‘bolt-on’ 
opportunities and we were pleased to announce our 
25% investment in premium Irish whiskey brands, 
The Dubliner and The Dublin Liberties in July this 
year. Now that Poland has been stabilised, we return 
to looking at larger, more strategic opportunities to 
deliver enhanced growth and shareholder value for 
the future. More detail about the updated strategy is 
set out on pages 16 and 17.
Dividend
I am also pleased to announce our proposed final 
dividend for the year of 5.72 €cents per share 
(2016: 5.45 €cents per share). This takes the total 
dividends paid for the year to 8.10 €cents per 
David Maloney
Chairman
06
Stock Spirits Group PLC 
Annual Report & Accounts 2017  share (2016: 19.62 €cents per share, which also 
included a special dividend of 11.90 €cents per 
share). The adjusted free cashflow conversion of 
the Company continues to be a strength and at 
86.3% (2016: 94.1%) remains robust. The dividend 
policy has been revisited and the Board is moving 
from the 35% of net free cashflow (free cashflow 
after investments) approach outlined at IPO, in 
favour of progressive dividends where cashflow 
permits. We also reiterate our commitment 
to return surplus cash to shareholders should 
no meaningful capital investment or M&A 
opportunities arise. 
People
At the time of our interim results, we announced 
that Lesley Jackson, our Chief Financial Officer 
(CFO), would be retiring and would be replaced 
by Paul Bal. I would like to personally thank Lesley 
for her hard work and dedication to Stock Spirits; 
she took the Company through the IPO and has 
worked tirelessly over the years. Paul took office in 
November 2017 and has made a great start in the 
Company and I look forward to working with him 
more in the future.
Randy Pankevicz, Non-Executive Director, notified 
the Board of his resignation as a Director of the 
Company to enable him to focus on his personal 
investments. He does not intend to seek re-
election at the forthcoming AGM.
The Board would like to thank Mr Pankevicz for 
his contribution to the Company over the last two 
years and wish him well for the future.
Governance
The retirement of Lesley and the appointment of 
Paul as CFO was the only Board change in the year.
Following the more extensive changes to the Board 
in 2016, the new members have been fully engaged 
not only in the strategic review process but have 
also made significant and valuable contributions in 
all Board matters. I am pleased with the results.  
All Board Committee compositions are fully 
compliant with the Corporate Governance Code. 
See page 55 of this report for further details. 
The Board and its various Committees have met 
regularly throughout the year and an internal 
Board evaluation exercise was undertaken during 
the year (see page 58). 
Looking ahead
As I have mentioned previously, the implications of 
Brexit on the Group are not considered material at 
this stage, but we will continue to monitor progress 
on the negotiations currently taking place. 
With a stable Board, senior management team 
and award-winning brands, I am looking forward 
to delivering on our refreshed strategy to ensure 
growth and increased shareholder returns.

Consumers’ increasing disposable 
income prompts growing demand for 
perceived higher quality, differentiated

categories to provide consumers with 
compelling reasons to pay more and  
to build equity that can withstand  
price competition.

Strategic Review Governance Financial Statements
09 The performance of spirits in our markets, as 
in any other geography, is linked to shifts in 
demographics, fluctuations in the performance 
of local economies with the associated impact on 
consumer confidence and disposable income, plus 
the regulatory environment.
A number of positive underlying macro consumer 
trends, outlined in more detail below, are 
anticipated to contribute to spirits value growth 
in our markets.
In the short term, disposable incomes may 
fluctuate with economic and regulatory 
circumstances, but the long term evolution of 
our markets has seen a progressive growth in 
standards of living and disposable income and with 
them an expansion of consumer choice which is 
positively impacting the demand for higher value 
spirits in the region. 
The sustainable growth of Stock Spirits reflects 
our ability to identify and take advantage of these 
trends by evolving our brand portfolio, supported 
by consistent investment in brand communications, 
innovation and operational capabilities.

Stock Spirits Group PLC 
Annual Report & Accounts 2017  Desire for affordable luxury
As disposable income grows, greater numbers of 
consumers in our markets are able to choose higher 
quality products for which they are prepared to pay 
more. They seek spirits from trustworthy brands of 
better and more consistent quality than they were 
able to purchase historically. This can be through a 
desire to display their own success, expertise, values 
or lifestyle through their choice of brands, but the 
behaviour can also be driven by the desire to retain 
accessible everyday luxuries when economic times 
are challenging. Affordable, perceived high quality 
brands remain the preferred choice and spirits can 
be just such an affordable luxury. 
Diversification of drinking occasions 
The number and variety of drinking occasions in 
our markets is evolving over time, with a gradual 
increase in “on the go” and “out of home” drinking 
occasions accompanying social change.
These drinking occasions are a growing part of 
consumption routines and open up opportunities 
for different formats and pack sizes. At home 
drinking is diversifying, with a move from traditional 
meal associated usage to contemporary needs 
such as connoisseurship, by choosing higher quality 
spirits as a reward at the end of the day.
Increased spirits consumption amongst 
females and young adults
Changes in society in our markets are prompting 
greater consumption by female and young adult 
drinkers and these consumers seek different tastes 
and alcohol by volume to those available historically. 
Flavoured spirits and relatively lower alcohol spirits 
have grown faster than traditional spirits in recent 
years as females and younger adult drinkers seek 
easy drinkability and tastes which appeal to mixed 
gender groups of friends. There is also a growing 
desire for innovation and novelty as these consumers 
see their drinks choice as a means of self-expression 
and want to drink new and different flavours.
Growing confidence in local provenance
Immediately after the collapse of the old regimes 
in Central and Eastern Europe, there was a limited 
number of high quality brands of local provenance 
available, a sense that international brands were 
superior, coupled with a historical suspicion of 
inconsistent quality and counterfeiting. Now that the 
new economies are longer established and memories 
of the old regimes are fading, there is a resurgence of 
pride in local achievements, provenance and culture 
and a dawning recognition that local brands can  
be as good or superior to imported ones. 
The new premiumised 
Božkov Republica launched 
in February 2018
11
Strategic Review Governance Financial Statements Local spirits remain the vast majority of spirits 
volume in Central and Eastern Europe and there 
is a noticeable trend to drink better quality 
exponents of those local spirits from trusted 
brands and manufacturers. The fact that many 
of these markets are “dark”, i.e. marketing 
communications are strictly regulated and limited, 
makes it harder for imported brands to build 
share through the deployment of heavyweight 
advertising investment in the fashion often 
witnessed in other markets. In this context, 
affordable, high quality local brands with 
authenticity and provenance are well placed  
to act as a bridge to the fulfilment of rising 
consumer aspirations. 
Increasing international mobility
Before the fall of the old regimes in Central and 
Eastern Europe and the reunification of Europe, 
international travel was extremely limited for 
the residents of our core markets, as were direct 
encounters with other international cultures. 
There were very limited visits to our markets by 
foreign visitors. The situation is radically different 
today and is likely to remain so going forward.  
A combination of greater numbers of consumers 
in our core markets travelling widely abroad for 
work, education or pleasure, plus hugely increased 
numbers of visitors from abroad visiting our 
markets for the same reasons, is influencing local 
drinking cultures. New usage categories and size 
formats are developing in response to increased 
international mobility.
Raised awareness of health and social 
responsibilities
A combination of government regulation and 
increased consumer awareness of the health and 
social responsibility issues associated with alcohol 
consumption is prompting demand for lower 
alcohol by volume spirits ranges and increased 
consumption of spirits in longer mixed drinks, 
rather than purely as shots, the traditional mode 
of consumption in much of Central and Eastern 
Europe. There is also a growth in consumer 
interest in the use of perceived “natural” rather 
than “artificial” ingredients, sourced where 
possible, from identifiable, trustworthy local 
producers. Spirits brands whose ranges include 
lower alcohol by volume and versatile mixers and 
which use natural ingredients are well placed to 
take advantage of this trend. 
Spirits well placed to grow value sustainably
The combination of our aspirational brands, 
wide range of innovative tastes, breadth of 
options by alcohol content and flexible packaging 
formats, mean Stock Spirits is well placed to grow 
sustainably in our markets by continuing to meet 
these evolving consumer needs.
Macro consumer trends contribute

Amundsen 
Expedition
Stock Spirits saw an opportunity to  
launch a top premium clear vodka with 
multi-national appeal across all of its 
wholly owned sales and marketing 
operations. A great example of leveraging 
Group synergies.
Comprehensive qualitative and quantitative multi-market consumer 
research was conducted to determine the optimal liquid and brand 
proposition to achieve this. The result was Amundsen Expedition vodka.
Amundsen Expedition combines a universally recognisable physical 
benefit – the chilled, pristine purity of glacial water and the South Pole, 
an idea understood by consumers across our markets, with an emotional 
proposition with multi-national appeal, the desire for exploration, 
discovery and new experiences.
Amundsen Expedition is the first Stock Spirits vodka to be distributed 
in all of the markets where we have wholly owned sales and marketing 
operations, and has leveraged Group synergies to enter top premium 
vodka with a unified solution.

Viability statement
The Directors have assessed the viability of the Group 
over a three-year period and confirm that they have a 
reasonable expectation that the Group will continue 
to operate and meet its liabilities, as they fall due. The 
Directors have determined that the three-year period 
to December 2020 is an appropriate period over which 
to provide its viability statement, after taking into 
consideration a number of factors, including that the 
Group’s strategic planning process covers a three-year 
period and that the spirits industry is considered to be 
non-cyclical.
The Directors’ assessment has been made with reference 
to the Group’s current position, the Group’s strategy, the 
Board’s risk appetite and the principal risks facing the 
Group in severe but plausible scenarios, taking account of 
the velocity of the risk impact and the effectiveness of any 
mitigating actions, including insurance, as detailed above. 
The strategy and associated principal risks underpin the 
Group’s three-year plans and scenario testing, which the 
Directors review annually.
This assessment has considered the potential impacts of 
these risks on the business model, future performance, 
solvency and liquidity over the period. Whilst this review 
does not consider all of the risks that the Group may face,  
the Directors consider that this stress-testing based 
assessment of the Group’s prospects is reasonable in  
the circumstances.

Principal risks and uncertainties
Stock Spirits believes the following to be the principal risks facing its 
business and the steps we take to manage and mitigate these risks. 
Risks are identified and assessed through a combined bottom-up and 
top-down robust assessment, as explained in the Corporate governance 
framework section of this Annual Report on page 55. If any of these 
risks occur, Stock Spirits’ business, financial condition and performance 
might suffer and the trading price and liquidity of the shares may 
decline. Not all of these risks are within our control and this list cannot 
be considered to be exhaustive, as other risks and uncertainties may 
emerge in a changing business environment.

Economic and political change, including Brexit
The Group’s results are affected by overall 
economic conditions in its key geographic markets 
and the level of consumer confidence and spending 
in those markets. The Group’s operations are 
primarily in Central and Eastern European markets 
where there is a risk of economic and regulatory 
uncertainty. In the Group’s experience, the 
local laws and regulations in the region where 
it operates are not always fully transparent, can 
be difficult to interpret and may be applied and 
enforced inconsistently. In addition, the Group’s 
strategy involves expanding its business in several 
emerging markets, including in certain Central and 
Eastern European countries that are not members 
of the European Union. Political, economic and 
legal systems and conditions in emerging market 
economies are generally less predictable. 
The extent of the economic and political instability 
created by Brexit remains difficult to predict. 
Brexit uncertainty 
continues, though the 
impact on our business is 
limited so far: the ongoing 
weakening of Sterling 
following Brexit has had 
a favourable impact on 
translation of results of  
our UK business.
We monitor and analyse economic 
indicators and consumer consumption 
trends, which in turn influences our 
product portfolio and new product 
development.
The majority of countries that we 
currently operate in are part of the 
European Union, and therefore are 
subject to EU regulation. We monitor 
the economic conditions within each 
market and review our product portfolio, 
route to market and adjust our position 
accordingly. 
We continue to monitor the impact of 
Brexit and will react promptly as we 
consider appropriate. Given that we do 
not produce or export from the UK, we 
continue to believe the impact of Brexit 
upon the Group will not be significant.
Taxes 
Increases in taxes, particularly increases to excise 
duty rates and VAT, could adversely affect demand 
for the Group’s products.
Demand for the Group’s products is particularly 
sensitive to fluctuations in excise taxes, since excise 
taxes generally constitute the largest component of 
the sales price of spirits. 
The Group may be exposed to tax liabilities resulting 
from tax audits: the Group has in the past faced, 
currently faces and may in the future face, audits and 
other challenges brought by tax authorities. Changes 
in tax laws and related interpretations and increased 
enforcement actions and penalties may alter the 
environment in which the Group does business. In 
addition, certain tax positions taken by the Group 
are based on industry practice and external tax 
advice and/or are based on assumptions and involve 
a significant degree of judgement.
In addition to the ongoing 
tax inspections in Italy, 
Czech and Poland that 
were disclosed in last 
year’s Annual Report & 
Accounts, during 2017 
our German subsidiary 
received notification from 
the German tax authorities 
of the commencement 
of a tax audit covering its 
2014 and 2015 corporate 
income tax return. To date, 
no tax assessment has 
been received in respect  
of this open audit.
Through our membership of local market 
spirits associations we seek to engage 
with local tax and customs authorities as 
well as government representatives and, 
where appropriate, provide informed 
input to the unintended consequences 
of excise increases e.g. growth of illicit 
alcohol and potential harm to consumers.
The Group engages the services of a 
professional global firm of tax advisors 
and undertakes regular audits of our  
own tax processes, documentation  
and compliance. We aim to operate  
the business in a tax-efficient and 
compliant manner at all times. We  
make appropriate provisions where  
tax liabilities appear likely.
Strategic transactions 
Key objectives of the Group are: (i) the 
development of new products and variants; and 
(ii) expansion, in the Central and Eastern European 
region and certain other European countries, 
through the acquisition of additional businesses. 
Unsuccessful launches or failure by the Group to 
fulfil its expansion plans or integrate completed 
acquisitions could have a material adverse effect  
on the Group’s growth potential and performance. 
Our NPD process has 
delivered successful 
innovations, including Black 
Fox herbal bitter liqueur 
in Czech during 2017. 
We continuously seek to 
strengthen our portfolio.
During 2017, we 
acquired a 25% stake in 
Quintessential Brands 
Ireland Whiskey Ltd, 
giving us significant equity 
interest in the fast growing 
Irish Whiskey category. 
We continue to seek value-accretive 
acquisition targets and have an 
experienced management team capable 
of exploring, pursuing and executing 
transaction opportunities swiftly and 
diligently, however the owners of target 
businesses may have price expectations 
that are beyond the valuation that 
we can place on their business. If we 
are unable to complete meaningful 
acquisitions, we will consider distributing 
surplus cash to shareholders.

Consumer preferences
Shifts in consumer preferences may adversely affect 
the demand for the Group’s products and weaken the 
Group’s competitive position. A decline in the social 
acceptability of the Group’s products may also lead to 
a decrease in the Group’s revenue. In some countries 
in Europe, the consumption of beverages with higher 
alcohol content has declined due to changing social 
attitudes towards drinking (see Our Markets section).
Overall, there has 
been little change in 
consumer preferences 
during 2017, although 
our Keglevich 
brand continues to 
suffer from ongoing 
changes in its target 
consumers’ habits 
resulting from poor 
macro-economic 
conditions in Italy. 
The Group undertakes extensive 
consumer research and has a track 
record of successful new product 
development to constantly meet 
changing consumer needs. We have 
developed a range of lower alcohol 
products and feel confident that we have 
the expertise to continue to develop 
products that meet and satisfy consumer 
needs.
Talent
The Group’s success depends substantially upon the 
efforts and abilities of key personnel and its ability to 
retain such personnel. The executive management team 
has significant experience and has made an important 
contribution to the Group’s growth and success. The 
loss of the services of any member of the executive 
management team of the Group or of a company 
acquired by the Group, could have an adverse effect 
on the Group’s operations. The Group may also not be 
successful in attracting and retaining such individuals in 
the future. 
During the year 
we continued to 
strengthen our 
management 
team with new 
appointments in 
digital marketing, 
NPD, operations,  
legal and finance.
The Group operates a competitive 
remuneration policy that aims to retain, 
motivate and, where necessary, attract 
key individuals. We have developed a 
leadership framework to guide our talent 
management and a formal succession 
planning process to mitigate the risk  
of losing key personnel. 
Marketplace and competition
The Group operates in a highly competitive environment 
and faces competitive pressures from both local and 
international spirits producers, which may result in 
pressure on prices and loss of market share. This has 
been particularly evident in Poland historically (see 
Chief Executive’s statement). Changes in the Group’s 
distribution channels may also have an adverse effect on 
the Group’s profitability and business. 
A significant portion of the Group’s revenue is derived 
from a small number of customers. The Group may not be 
able to maintain its relationships with these customers or 
renegotiate agreements on favourable terms, or may be 
unable to collect payments from some customers, which 
will lead to an impact in its financial condition. 
The Group is also dependent on a few key products in a 
limited number of markets which contribute a significant 
portion of its revenue. 
In Poland, we 
continued to respond 
to price reductions 
by competitors and 
demonstrated our 
resilience by growing 
our market share 
in key categories 
without a significant 
impact on our profit 
margins.
The Group has mechanisms and 
strategies in place to mitigate the 
damage of profit erosion but there 
is no assurance they may work in 
the economies and competitive 
environments in which we operate.
We constantly review our distribution 
channels and our customer relationships. 
We understand the changing nature 
of the trade channels and customer 
positions within those channels. We 
trade across all channels and actively 
manage our profit mix by both channel 
and customer. 
We have well-established credit control 
policies and procedures and we put in 
place trade receivables insurance where 
it is cost effective to do so.

Exchange rates
The Group’s business operations and results reported in 
Euros are subject to risks associated with fluctuations in 
currency exchange rates. 
The Group generates revenue primarily in Polish Złoty 
and secondarily in Czech Koruna and a large portion of 
the Group’s assets and liabilities are denominated in Złoty 
and Koruna. 
The Group’s non-trading activities are conducted through 
its Corporate Office in the UK and are mainly transacted 
in GB Pounds.
Additionally, the Group’s financial covenants are tested in 
Euros. Consequently, movement in the other currencies 
in which the earnings, assets and liabilities of the Group’s 
subsidiaries are denominated could adversely impact the 
Group’s ability to comply with these financial covenants.
See Financial Review section for more detail about the 
impact of foreign exchange.
During the year, the 
majority of foreign 
exchange exposure 
reported within 
operating profit arose 
on the devaluation 
of the British Pound, 
which reduced 
corporate office costs 
on a translated basis. 
The Group aims to hedge transaction 
risk by matching cashflows, assets and 
liabilities through normal commercial 
business arrangements where possible. 
For example, all debt is currently drawn 
in local currency by market. 
For locations where we have non-trading 
activities, there is a limitation on the 
natural hedging that is available to cover 
currency exchange risk.
We monitor currency exposure as an 
integral part of our monthly review 
process and, where appropriate, 
implement hedging instruments.
Disruption to operations or systems
The Group’s operating results may be adversely affected 
by disruption to its production and storage facilities, in 
particular its main production facilities in Poland and the 
Czech Republic, or by a breakdown of its information or 
management control systems.
During 2017, 
we experienced 
an equipment 
malfunction in our 
Baltic distillery, 
which resulted in 
the temporary shut 
down of production 
at that site. However, 
contingency plans 
were enacted, and no 
disruption was caused 
to our business.
In addition to holding appropriate 
insurance cover to protect the business 
in the event of a production disruption 
or other business interruption, our two 
primary bottling sites offer sufficient 
flexibility that each site is capable of 
bottling all of our core SKUs.
We also have well-established and 
tested Business Continuity and Disaster 
Recovery policies. Our information and 
management control systems are subject 
to internal audit following a risk-based 
methodology. We also periodically 
engage independent specialists to assess 
and test the security and resilience of 
our network against hacking and other 
cyber threats, which include penetration 
testing.

Laws and regulations
The Group is subject to extensive laws and regulations 
limiting advertising, promotions and access to its 
products, as well as laws and regulations relating to its 
operations, such as health, safety and environmental laws. 
These regulations and any changes to these regulations 
could limit its business activities or increase costs. In 
some cases, such as the recent introduction in Poland of 
restrictions on retailers trading on Sundays, the changes 
in law impact the Group indirectly.
The Group may be affected by litigation directed at the 
alcoholic beverages industry and other litigation such 
as intellectual property disputes, product liability claims, 
product labelling disputes and administrative claims. 
The Group may be exposed to civil or criminal liabilities 
under anti-bribery or anti-trust laws and any violation 
of such laws could have a material adverse effect on its 
reputation and business.
Preparations for 
the implementation 
of the EU General 
Data Protection 
Regulations in May 
2018 are in progress.
The EU is currently 
considering regulatory 
changes that would 
prohibit or restrict 
the use of a particular 
rum aroma that is 
currently used in our 
Božkov tuzemsky 
product in Czech 
Republic. Through 
the Czech spirits 
industry association 
and the relevant 
Czech government 
departments, we have 
closely monitored and 
participated in the 
process and, although 
the final outcome 
is not yet clear, we 
do not anticipate a 
significant impact 
upon our business.
The Group has established clear 
processes and controls to monitor 
compliance with laws and regulations, 
and changes to them, and also any 
litigation action. We operate a detailed 
anti-bribery and anti-trust policy and 
process. Regular update training is 
conducted across the business and we 
undertake regular reviews to assess 
the adequacy and effectiveness of our 
policies and processes.
Supply of raw materials
Changes in the prices or availability of supplies and raw 
materials could have a material adverse effect on the 
Group’s business. Commodity price changes may result 
in increases in the cost of raw materials and packaging 
materials for the Group’s products due to a variety of 
factors outside the Group’s control. The Group may not 
be able to pass on increases in the costs of raw materials 
to its customers and, even if it is able to pass on cost 
increases, the adjustments may not be immediate and 
may not fully offset the extra costs or may cause a decline 
in sales volumes.
Our cost optimisation 
initiatives in 
procurement, 
including more 
centralised 
purchasing, have 
allowed costs of 
goods to remain 
largely flat.
Where possible and appropriate the 
Group will negotiate term contracts for 
the supply of core raw materials and 
services on competitive terms to manage 
pricing fluctuations.

Funding and liquidity
Market conditions could subject the Group to unexpected 
needs for liquidity, which may require the Group to 
increase its levels of indebtedness. Access to financing  
in the longer term depends on a variety of factors  
outside the Group’s control, including capital and  
credit market conditions.
Higher interest rates and more stringent borrowing 
requirements could increase the Group’s financing 
charges and reduce profitability.
Significantly lower 
finance costs 
continued during 
2017 as a result of  
the refinancing of 
bank facilities in 2015.
The Group maintains a strong focus 
on cash, our future requirements for 
funding and the overall external market 
for financing. We undertake regular and 
detailed reviews of both short-term and 
longer-term liquidity requirements by 
market, including our growth ambitions. 
We are confident that we have the 
appropriate processes and relationships 
in place to respond to any unexpected 
liquidity needs and have not only 
secured lower cost and more flexible re-
financing, but have also placed ourselves 
in the best position to access funding in

Stock Spirits Group PLC 
Annual Report & Accounts 2017  Group financial performance
Evidence of stabilisation and turnaround is in 
the results: growth in volume, share, revenues, 
profitability and cashflow. The balance sheet 
strengthened further, as net debt was reduced,  
and financing facilities were extended.
Turnaround in Poland
Our first focus was embedding the changes 
initiated in 2016, chiefly under the “Root & 
Branch review”. This included strengthening 
and optimising our entire business to better 
compete in an intensely competitive market. 
To keep competitive, we had to further engage 
in the pricing re-alignment that the market has 
experienced since 2014, as our primary competitor 
continued an aggressive pricing strategy. Working 
with customers, we adjusted pricing architecture 
on selected products to stay competitive in on-
shelf pricing. This, along with better execution in 
the trade, is the major driver of 2017’s results. 
We continued to grow share in volume and value 
since December 2016, while monitoring the 
clearly divergent strategies, not to mention mixed 
fortunes, of our two main competitors.
Whilst these results are encouraging, we remain 
vigilant and the market, though stable, has yet to  
see upward pricing, as the market leader remains 
highly competitive. 
The economy supported growth, with rising average 
incomes. Though the Government will restrict 
Sunday trading in 2018, we expect limited impact. 
The vodka market continues to grow, and it 
remains, by far, the largest spirits category. Clear 
vodka is the main variant. Despite the aggressive 
pricing in economy and mainstream segments, 
consumers are up-trading to more premium and 
prestige brands, reflecting growing affluence. 
We benefit from this, given our brands’ strong 
positions in premium price segments. Flavoured 
vodka has traditionally seen less premiumisation 
and so represents an opportunity, particularly as it 
grows ahead of the overall vodka category.
The traditional trade remains the key vodka trade 
channel, and one competitor’s effective withdrawal 
from direct involvement in this prominent channel 
presents another opportunity for us.
In terms of our brands, our priority was 
distribution-build and consumer-activation over 
new product development (NPD). Our NPD 
focused on Saska flavour extensions and re-
launching Stock 84 brandy. 
Our biggest brand, Żołᶏdkowa de Luxe, returned 
to growth in sales, out-performing both the overall 
and clear vodka categories. Most of the growth 
came from the traditional trade. Żołᶏdkowa 
Gorzka responded well to activation programmes 
directed at younger adult drinkers. We continue 
to strengthen Stock Prestige, for example with the 
exclusive limited edition Stock Prestige Carbon. 
Above it, in top premium, Amundsen Expedition 
continues to grow. We achieved more effective 
price execution on our economy brands Żubr and 
1906, as well as introducing a 9cl variant. In the 
flavoured vodka sub-category, impressive growth 
from the more premium Stock Prestige flavours 
and Saska could not raise our share given slower 
growth on Żołᶏdkowa Gorzka and the decline in  
Lubelska sales. 
Our distribution arrangement with Beluga Group, 
now in its second year, saw the brand Beluga out-
perform the ultra-premium segment.

Progress in the Czech Republic
Our Czech business delivered another set of 
robust results, extending leadership in the 
overall market. The spirits category continues 
to grow in volume and value, supported by the 
economy performing well, with earnings rising. 
This delivered growth, especially in the premium 
off-trade. The on-trade was impacted by increased 
smoking restrictions.
We see aggressive pricing across some sub-
categories, and monitor positions closely and 
take actions as necessary, for example where 
we strengthened category-management in the 
modern trade.
Božkov returned to growth – strengthened by focus 
and investment, including new Božkov Tradicni 
and Božkov Bily variants providing incremental 
share. The brand won the “Most Trusted Spirits 
Brand” award for the second successive year. It also 
delivered better profitability and share growth.
The Pražská, Nordic Ice and Dynybyl brands 
acquired in 2016, and integrated ahead of plan, 
significantly contributed to our growth in the vodka 
category, as well as our Czech results overall.
The Black Fox launch was a strategic entry 
with a new brand into the premium herbal 
bitters category at a time of intensifying price-
competition. The launch highlights increased use 
of digital marketing in our campaigns.
Our important relationship with Diageo delivered 
well for both partners, and is being extended 
into 2019, with our leading distribution helping 
Diageo to be the 2nd fastest growing spirits 
company in the market. Building on this successful 
relationship, we gained approval to distribute 
Beam-Suntory products and to explore synergies 
that exist between these two complementary 
portfolios. With the Diageo, Beam-Suntory and 
Quintessential Brands Irish Whiskey portfolios 
leveraging our Czech distribution, we will have the 
strongest range of third party brands covering all 
segments of the growing whisky category.
The impact from a possible EU ban on certain 
ingredients in rum ether is being managed, and we 
anticipate limited impact, given our plans in hand.
Challenges in Italy
The Italian market continues to be challenging 
and high young-adult unemployment continues 
to impact our brands, primarily Keglevich, but we 
detect some optimism recently. The overall spirits 
category grew slightly, mainly through limoncello, 
gin and aperitifs, with pricing offsetting flat 
volumes overall.
We launched Syramusa, an ultra-premium  
Limoncé extension to consolidate our leadership  
in limoncello. The iconic Stock 84 brandy was  
re-launched with overt on-trade focus. The premium 
XO variant performs well, enabling us to remain in 
2nd place in the brandy category.
As a result of the challenging environment, the 
Italian business’ value suffered impairment (further 
details are provided by Paul in the Financial 
Review), a risk we had highlighted at the half year. 
Chief Executive’s statement continued

Strategic Review Governance Financial Statements Whilst Keglevich retains leadership in clear vodka 
and it extended its leadship in flavoured vodka, this 
sub-category is declining. In late 2017 we brought 
to market our re-vamped Keglevich fruit variants, 
to better fit the changing preferences of the young 
adult consumers. This was the initial step of a multi-
year program to strengthen the Keglevich brand.
Nuove Distillerie Vicenze, a liqueur business,  
was added as a distribution partner in November, 
as was Nordés Gin. The organisation was further 
restructured, investing more in the salesforce, 
especially in the on-trade. Though we made 
encouraging progress in the modern trade, our 
insufficient scale hampers results.
Strong results in Slovakia
This business delivered to expectation, with 
solid performance by the Golden Ice range 
strengthening our position in the premium fruit 
spirits sub-category.
To penetrate the premium profit pool further,  
we signed a distribution agreement with  
Beam-Suntory here also. Combining our distribution 
capability and Beam-Suntory’s strong investment in 
Jim Beam, we delivered pleasing results. 
With the Jim Beam, Distell and Quintessential 
Brands Irish Whiskey portfolios under our 
distribution, we now have a range of brands 
covering the rapidly growing whisky category.
Our relationship with Beluga continued to deliver 
growth in the ultra-premium vodka sub-category. 
Other markets
There was good performance in Croatia. Our focus 
is in the on-trade and distribution was extended 
beyond the Beam-Suntory relationship to include 
Beluga Group, Bortran rum and Bols.
Stock 84 brandy became the biggest spirits brand 
in Bosnia. It benefitted from the re-vamp, seeing 
growing appeal amongst young adult drinkers, 
especially in the on-trade. Bosnia also benefitted 
from a new Beluga distribution agreement. 
Innovations
The Group's NPD process was strengthened 
during the year in order to help extend our reach in 
premium and higher price segments. The improved 
process aims to reduce the number of new launches 
whilst increasing their impact and speed to market, 
thus providing a better return from investment.
Operations and supply chain
We continue to develop our excellent supply chain 
to further leverage our core competitive strengths of 
productivity, smart cost management and technical 
talent. This delivered further efficiencies and 
effectiveness and contributed to our overall success. 
We invested across people, facilities, processes 
and systems. We are now well-invested, and future 
investment focuses on safety and quality. 
Sales and operations planning development was a 
major enabler of improved performance, integrating 
all disciplines and markets to drive us forward. Our 
operations team won awards in Poland: 
• BRC Food and IFS Food Certification (the first 
spirits producer to gain both accreditations), and 
• ‘Employer – Organiser of Safe Work’ (from PIP, 
the State Labour Inspectorate).
During the year we suffered an equipment failure 
in our Baltic distillery. Though spirits production 
was interrupted for a brief period, our businesses 
were able to operate as normal. The distillery has 
since returned to normal operations.

Stock Spirits Group PLC 
Annual Report & Accounts 2017  Technology
We continue to invest in technology, leveraging 
prior investments made under the “One Network” 
strategy. Our cyber security kept the business 
safe, and we stay focused on security. 
We completed the first phase implementation 
of a software-defined Wide Area Network 
(WAN) which has improved service levels. The 
second phase will deliver a “Tier 3” datacentre to 
house critical technology. As we extend digital 
capabilities across our business, we will have a 
technology base and capability underpinning this.
The group-wide Intranet, StockNet, was launched 
to provide a collaborative platform to quickly 
share and deliver further digitalisation. A unified 
communications suite delivers continued savings in 
travel, whilst enabling more engagement through 
virtual meetings. Progress to a single group-wide 
SAP platform continues.
Our people
StockNet is an effective and exciting mechanism 
engaging and energising us into a more aligned 
workforce. Through this we leverage the full 
power of our people wherever they are. StockNet 
was used to conduct our first ever Employee 
Engagement Survey. We welcomed high 
participation and are studying the feedback. 
Our partners
The Group's partnership with Beam-Suntory 
was extended beyond Poland into the Czech 
Republic and Slovakia and we have mentioned 
our continuing partnership with Diageo. There 
is a new agreement in place with Beluga Group 
to distribute the ultra-premium vodka Beluga in 
Croatia and Bosnia. We also changed our route to 
market in the UK and moved distribution of our 
brands to Distell International. 
Following investment in Quintessential Brands’ 
Irish whiskey business, we have secured the 
right, from the owners of our existing whiskey 
agency brands, to distribute the brands from the 
investment where the brand range will enrich our 
portfolios around the Group.
Our strategy
With the turnaround of our Polish business 
underway, we carried out a comprehensive 
review of the Group's strategy during the latter 
half of the year. We concluded that the strategy 
communicated at the time of the IPO remained 
valid, but that developments in our key markets 
since then mean that there is a greater need than 
ever before to focus on our brands in order to keep 
pace with the changing needs and tastes of our 
end consumers. Our focus now is therefore on four 
pillars of growth: Premiumisation, Millennials, Digital 
and M&A. These are supported by a foundation 
of engaged and empowered talent, effective 
processes, smart resource allocation and world 
class partners bringing complementary strengths. 
Further detail is set out on pages 16 and 17.
M&A
To penetrate faster growing profit pools, a 25% stake 
was taken in Quintessential Brands Ireland Whiskey 
Limited, producer of “The Dubliner” and “The Dublin 
Liberties” whiskies. The former was the world’s 
fastest growing Irish whiskey in 2016. Quintessential 
is the second biggest spirits supplier in the UK and 
has global reach, selling in over 30 countries. We 
expect our investment to be earnings accretive 
by 2021, as their new Dublin distillery becomes 
operational in 2018. 
Outlook 
With a strengthened team and a more resilient 
Polish business, combined with a strong balance 
sheet and cashflow generation, we are 
well placed to exploit opportunities 
to expand our business.

Strategic Review Governance Financial Statements Poland is the Group’s largest market in terms of 
revenue and profit. The success of Stock Polska is 
the highest priority for the Group.
During 2017 the Polish economy grew steadily at 
above 4% and average salaries continued to rise, 
increasing Polish consumers’ purchasing power.
These positive macro trends were reflected in 
continued growth from the vodka category, still by 
far the largest spirits category in Poland (c. 80% 
of total spirits volume

). Total vodka value grew 
+1.7% during 2017, remaining marginally ahead of 
volume growth at +1.5%

Growth was driven by the flavoured sub-category, 
at +9.5% value. Clear vodka’s slight value decline 
continued at -1.0%.
The largest channel, the traditional trade, 
continues to outperform the market, achieving 
+3.2% value growth in marked contrast to the 
modern trade where value declined -1.0%.
The ultra-premium (+25.4%), top international 
premium (+6.5%) and premium vodka segments 
(+2.9%) remained in strong growth ahead of 
the total market, dispelling the myth that vodka 
in Poland has become commoditised. The

prices on the leading mainstream brands have 
switched consumers from economy to higher 
perceived value mainstream, in what is now 
effectively a single price segment.
Core brands 
Stock Polska out-performed the market in the 
clear vodka category, driving progressive share 
gains. A significant contributor was the return 
to growth of our largest core brand by volume, 
Żołądkowa de Luxe, whose total volume grew 
+2.9%, well ahead of the clear vodka category. 
Żołądkowa de Luxe’s volume recovery has been 
driven in the traditional trade, the largest trade 
channel, where at +6.2%, it is well ahead of total 
clear vodka growth at +1.4%
2
.
Żołądkowa Gorzka achieved volume growth 
+2.5%, driven by innovative brand activation to 
expand consumer consumption occasions at peak 
seasonal periods
2
.
A mark of both Żołądkowa Gorzka’s and 
Żołądkowa de Luxe’s continuing appeal was their 
recognition at the “Superbrand: Polish Brand” 
awards in November 2017. 
Whilst Stock Polska grew its total flavoured 
category volume and value versus last year, 
achieving impressive growth on premium-priced 
Stock Prestige Flavours (volume +36.6%) and 
Saska Flavours (+47.2%), a return to growth ahead 
of the flavoured category will require further 
strengthening of our core flavoured critical mass 
brands which, whilst recovering, are still behind 
the market in Żołądkowa Gorzka’s case (+2.5%), 
and still down on Lubelska (-2.5%)
2
.
In the premium segment, we continued to 
strengthen Stock Prestige with consistent consumer 
activation at the point of purchase, including a 
unique Stock Prestige Carbon limited edition, which 
contributed to a +15.0% growth in volume

. 
In top premium vodka, Amundsen Expedition grew 
volume by +35.0%, well ahead of top premium 
segment growth of +8.0% in volume

We revisited our approach to the economy vodka 
segment, closely monitoring price execution on our 
two economy brands Żubr and 1906, as well as 
introducing an innovative 9cl bottle on Żubr instead 
of market standard 10cl. This enabled Stock Polska

Key competitors
In December 2017, Roust changed a number of 
key players in their senior management team, but 
it is too early to assess the impact of this move on 
Company strategy or performance. 
During 2017, Marie Brizard Wines and Spirits 
(MBWS) moved distribution of all their brands 
in the traditional trade channel to Eurocash, 
the largest spirits wholesaler in Poland. The 
move does not appear to have improved their 
performance in the traditional trade to date, where 
they have suffered a value decline of -10.9%
3
. It 
has also experienced senior management changes.
Organisational changes 
After a prolonged period of significant 
organisational and leadership change in Stock 
Polska, a stable management, sales and marketing 
team were in place throughout the year.
The restructuring and strengthening of our 
modern trade sales team has resulted in closer 
cooperation with key customers. We have 
achieved a step-change in the intensity and quality 
of promotional support, with our brands featured 
in almost triple the number of promotional leaflets 
versus last year
4
. 
Future outlook 
The Government approved a law that will gradually 
impose a ban on Sunday shopping and has given 
a right to local councils to forbid alcohol sales in 
designated areas from 10pm to 6am, which might 
have an impact on spirit sales.
2017 has been a year of stabilisation and 
strengthening for our core brands. Our clear vodka 
business is back in growth, with strong gains for 
Stock Prestige and Żołądkowa de L uxe. Our main 
challenge and key area of focus for 2018 is the 
higher-margin flavoured vodka segment, where we 
aim to achieve growth ahead of the category. We 
are well-placed to address this challenge with our 
revised flavoured strategy and plans to increase 
focus on our top flavoured brands, Żołądkowa 
Gorzka and Lubelska, and to drive continued 
growth on Saska.

Saska 
Over many centuries, Polish master distillers 
have perfected the art of manufacturing 
exquisite spirit drinks. The pursuit of 
pleasure is the essence of the Saska range, 
which includes both clear and flavoured 
variants. Saska’s individual, distinctive range 
of tastes have been carefully designed 
for contemporary pleasure seekers, to be 
enjoyed in an unhurried manner, savoured 
rather than shot. 
Flavour experts at our Lublin distillery drew inspiration from historical 
Polish recipes. The range includes an appealing combination of distinctive 
fruit aromas, hints of oak and the taste of the finest Polish vodka. In 2017 
two new flavours, Quince and Cherry with a hint of rum, joined the range.

executed, supporting our growing share in vodka

Future outlook
Debate continues in the EU Commission on the 
continued use of rum ether. If the aroma is to be 
banned from use in domestic rum (tuzemak) it would 
require recipe changes by all suppliers throughout 
the category, with potential cost implications.
Price competition remains strong, with specific

from this restructure have been reinvested 
in the sales team.
Similarly, significant transport cost savings have 
been achieved since switching logistics provider 
at the start of 2017, which again have been

confidence, young adult unemployment fell 
marginally towards the end of 2017 and the 
economy is beginning to show some growth, after 
years of decline.
Consequently the outlook for the Italian spirits

(25%). This may dampen some of the economic 
recovery seen of late.

. Adjusted EBITDA 
has grown by +7% during the year and Slovakia’s 
Adjusted EBITDA margin has improved by just 
under 1% point to over 23%.
In Croatia, volume grew by +6%. This was achieved 
primarily through up-weighted on-trade focus 
supported by the relaunch of Stock 84 and a 
widened range of distribution brands from Beam-
Suntory plus Beluga Group, Bortran Rum and  
Lucas Bols. 
The regional report for “Other” markets includes 
Slovakia, Bosnia, Croatia and our export activities.
In 2017 we maintained Adjusted EBITDA 
performance across our other markets, delivering 
€6.9million.
Revenue was slightly down in the year due to a 
shut down at our Baltic distillery caused by faulty 
equipment. The plant was quickly up and running 
and there was no loss of supply of vodka to our 
operations. The reduction in revenue was due to 
lost revenue from sales to third parties.
Strong growth from Slovakia, where revenues 
were +4% and Adjusted EBITDA +7% versus the 
previous year, was off-set by restructuring costs  
in our export markets.

Strategic Review Governance Financial Statements Responsible business report
We operate our business aware 
of our wider responsibilities
Business and ethics
Our Group Code of Conduct and Ethics (our Code) 
together with our Anti-Corruption and Bribery 
Policy and other related policies, set out the 
ethics, principles and standards that are required 
to be consistently upheld in each business and 
corporate function within the Group. It also 
applies to our business partners: suppliers, agents 
and customers. 
The Group has a Speak-Up hotline available in all 
countries where the Group has operations. The 
Speak-Up line can be used by any employee in 
the Group or by third parties and allows them to 
report any incidents or inappropriate behaviours 
in their own language. The confidentiality of the 
information reported is correctly protected. The 
Group also carries out refreshment training on the 
basic principles of our Code as well as the Speak-
Up line, so it is well known and, in the case of the 
Speak-Up line, can be used as needed, by any 
employee in the organisation. 
Stock Spirits considers that having good corporate 
responsibility is an essential element of achieving 
our overall objectives and acting as a responsible 
organisation. This includes developing strong 
relationships with our suppliers and customers, 
ensuring best-in-class people are joining the 
organisation and our commitment to the 
environment. We are committed to doing business 
responsibly and ensuring a culture of integrity.
Alcohol and society 
We are conscious that our products should be 
enjoyed responsibly by those who choose to  
drink them, and we do not want irresponsible 
drinking to harm the health of our consumers. 
We believe that efforts to reduce the misuse of 
alcohol are most effective if all parties involved 
(including authorities, individuals and producers) 
work together.
Czech Republic and Slovakia 
Our companies in these markets are founding 
members of “Fórum PSR”, which brings together the 
countries’ major spirits producers and distributors 
to work against alcohol abuse. The forum focuses 
primarily on preventive and educational projects 
targeting the serving of alcohol to minors, drink-
driving and excessive drinking. 
Additionally, we actively introduced the “PSR, 
(drink responsibly)” platform within our media, 
in-store and other brand communication. Forum 
members have also pledged to observe a code of 
conduct that strictly regulates their advertising 
activities. Stock Plzeň Božkov is a member 
of the Spirits Trade Association in the Czech 
Republic. This Association was active during 
2017 in supporting the local government in its 
ongoing efforts to implement a strong regulatory 
environment in the spirits industry.

Stock Spirits Group PLC 
Annual Report & Accounts 2017  Poland 
Stock Polska belongs to the Association of 
Employers Polish Spirits Industry (ZP Polski 
Przemysł, Spirytusowy), the trade organisation 
which, as part of its work, promotes responsible 
drinking through educational programmes and 
public campaigns. These include, “Don’t drink 
and drive”; “Pregnant – don’t drink”; “Responsible 
drinking”, an educational programme promoting 
responsible alcohol consumption, including 
guidelines on “How to sell and serve alcoholic 
drinks responsibly”; “Here we check Adulthood”, 
where the campaign’s objective is to reduce 
the availability of alcohol to the underage, by 
encouraging retailers to request identification 
from younger customers; and the most recent 
campaign “Alcohol. Always responsibly” which 
aims at building knowledge that all alcoholic 
beverages contain the same substance, therefore 
they have the same impact and all of them should 
be consumed responsibly. 
Italy
In Italy we are a member of Federvini, the national 
trade association founded in 1917 which, as part 
of its role, promotes responsible drinking using 
educational and informative programmes. 
Environment
Our businesses are fully aware of their 
responsibilities to the environment. In addition 
to mandatory compliance programmes, many 
of our businesses have undertaken a number 
of voluntary initiatives, which demonstrate the 
importance that is given to environmental matters. 
Poland
During 2017, we continued our environmental 
awareness campaign, using the ‘Sztokus’ mascot. 
The aim of the campaign was to raise the 
eco-awareness of Stock Polska personnel and 
employees of external partners and to reduce our 
environmental impact as a business.
The campaign was carried out at several levels:
• Eco-awareness and behaviours;
• Waste segregation and reduction;
• Water, gas and electricity savings initiatives; 
and
• Communication campaigns for environmental 
protection, including posters, banners and 
stickers displayed throughout the business.
In 2017, the Polish team organised several 
environmental initiatives which included: 
encouraging employees to travel to work 
using public transport, bicycles or 
carpooling (sharing their cars with co-
workers); video conferencing rather 
than travelling to meetings and an 
initiative aimed at increasing recycling 
by offering employees a pot plant in 
exchange for their recycling.
43
Strategic Review Governance Financial Statements Responsible business report continued
In 2017, the amount of waste we produced 
increased by 2%. We were able to recycle 89% 
of the waste we produced on site. Electricity 
increased by 4%. Increased use of the rectification 
facility led to 47% higher gas usage, and 14% 
higher water consumption compared to last year.
Czech Republic
In 2017, we improved efficiency of water and 
energy consumption. Water consumption 
decreased by 14% due to the installation of 
two new water treatments (reverse osmosis) in 
production (blending) which increased efficiency of 
water use. Reduction in water was also achieved 
by better planning. Electricity consumption 
decreased by 4% due to several projects including 
the installation of two new highly efficient 
compressors, better control of the compressed air 
leakage, newly installed efficient lights in blending 
premises and improvement of behaviour and 
discipline. Gas consumption decreased by 4% due 
to better planning. We were able to recycle 96% 
of the waste produced through employee training 
and improved processes of waste sorting.
Greenhouse gas emissions
In 2017, the Group’s total Scope 1 (direct) and 
Scope 2 (indirect) Greenhouse Gas (GHG) 
emissions were 31,770 tonnes and 9,001 tonnes 
of CO
2
e respectively (CO
2
e), a total of 40,771 
tonnes. This is a 11.5% decrease compared to 
46,055 tonnes in 2016 (35,955 tonnes of Scope 
1 and 10,100 tonnes of Scope 2 CO
2
e), and is 
due to reduced production and related energy 
consumption at the Baltic distillery because of the 
breakdown of the grain dryer in Q2 and Q3 2017. 
The emissions intensity for 2017 reduced by 
nearly 16% to 367 grams CO
2
e per litre of 
packaged product compared to 436 grams in 
2016. An increase in overall production was offset 
by a lower proportion of total production from 
the Baltic distillery which uses fuel with a high 
emission factor. The Baltic distillery accounted for 
72.8% of Group emissions in 2017 and remained 
the largest single emitter in the Group as its core 
activity is energy intensive rectification. 
As in prior years, we have applied the latest available 
DEFRA UK location based conversion factors (2017) 
to calculate the current year emissions. All data 
capture procedures, conversion and reporting have 
undergone independent limited assurance by ERM 
Certification and Verification Services. 
The Group complies with all current regulations on 
emissions including greenhouse gas emissions, where 
such regulation exists in our markets. We have 
reviewed the impact on the business from the EU 
Energy Efficiency Directive (2012/27/EU), and are 
conducting audits in line with these requirements.
We have reported on all of the emissions sources 
required under the Companies Act 2006 (Strategic 
Report and Directors’ Report) Regulations 2013. 
These sources fall within our consolidated financial 
statements. We do not have responsibility for 
any emission sources that are not included in our 
consolidated financial statements. 
Diversity
The success of a business depends on its people, 
therefore we are committed to providing every 
employee and potential employee with equal 
opportunity in all areas of employment.
The Group recognises the communities in 
which it operates and the benefits of having a 
diverse workforce at all levels. The Group takes 
its responsibilities with regard to equality and 
diversity seriously and expects all colleagues to 
also observe this. 
The senior management teams in our markets 
comprise predominantly of local nationals who 
understand the cultures in which we operate. 
We have an Equality and Diversity policy which 
applies to all colleagues as well as a recruitment 
policy which is inextricably linked to the Equality 
and Diversity policy to ensure that we recruit high 
calibre individuals matched to the requirements of 
the role we wish them to undertake, irrespective 
of gender, age, race, religion, sexual orientation, 
national origin or disability. As a consumer-focused 
business, we recognise the value that a diverse  
mix of employees provides us with, particularly  
in terms of consumer insights.
44
Stock Spirits Group PLC 
Annual Report & Accounts 2017  As an example of our diversity, at 31 December 
2017 we had a diverse mix of age with 18% under 
30 (17% in Poland and 19% in Plzeň) and 12% 
over 50 years old (12% in Plzeň and Poland). In the 
bottling area 3 out of 5 shift leaders in Plzeň and 
3 out of 16 shift leaders in Poland are women. In 
our production plant in Czech Republic 60% of the 
managerial positions are held by women. 
As at 31 December 2017, at Board level, 100% (8 
out of 8) of the Directors are male, while at senior 
management level 91% (10 out of 11) are male 
and across the Group 59% (556 out of 930) of all 
employees are male.
Diversity is key to the success of the Group, with 
emphasis placed not only on gender but also on 
culture, nationality and experience, and our Board 
continues to demonstrate diversity in the wider 
sense, with Directors from Poland, Canada, and 
Italy as well as the UK, bringing a range of both 
domestic and international experience to the 
Board. The Board’s diverse range of experience and 
expertise covers not only a wealth of experience 
of operating in FMCG but also extensive financial, 
marketing and commercial expertise. 
Human rights
The Group strives to comply fully with relevant 
legislation in the countries in which it operates 
and ensures that human rights are protected in all 
the production plants and offices from which the 
Group operates. As mentioned previously, we have 
a Code of Conduct that we ask all our suppliers 
to adhere to. This requires that they and the 
persons acting on their behalf act without regard 
to gender, age, race, religion, sexual orientation, 
national origin or disability in accordance with our 
Equality and Diversity Policy.
Employee involvement and policy 
regarding disabled persons
A description of the action taken by the Group in 
relation to employee involvement, including how 
the Group provides employees with information 
on matters concerning them and the Group, can 
be found on page 31. The Group has an equal 
opportunities policy, and procedures are in place 
that are designed to provide for full and fair 
consideration and selection of disabled applicants to 
ensure they are properly trained to perform safely 
and effectively, and to provide career opportunities 
that allow them to fulfil their potential. Where an 
employee becomes disabled in the course of their 
employment, the Group will actively seek to retain 
them wherever possible by making adjustments to 
their work content and environment, or by retraining 
them to undertake new roles.
Charity
During the year the UK corporate office took part in 
the Macmillan Cancer Support coffee morning which 
raised £400. Lesley Jackson, former CFO, opened 
her garden to the public as part of the National 
Garden Scheme and raised £2,400 for the charity.
The Group has a diverse 
workforce in terms of 
gender and age 
45
Strategic Review Governance Financial Statements Leveraging our balance 
sheet and cashflow strength 
operationally and for M&A
Volume growth at 6.5%, was driven by Poland and 
the Czech Republic. Although revenue per litre 
at €2.33 per litre (2016: €2.35)
2
 was impacted by 
pricing alignment in Poland, cost of goods per litre 
remained at 2016 levels. Therefore whilst overall 
gross profit increased 3.7%, the margin slipped a 
little to 50.0% (2016: 50.7%).
New product development (NPD) was more 
targeted on premiumising selected brands. As 
such, this is reflected in the slight decline in 
selling expenses by €0.5m to €60.8m. 
Other operating expenses increased marginally, 
due to increased people costs, partially offset by 
savings elsewhere. The increase was mostly driven 
by higher staff incentive awards and bonuses 
triggered across the business by the year’s 
stronger performance. 
Much of the cost-saving restructuring initiated 
over recent years impacted corporate costs. 
Consequently, corporate costs include costs  
of restructuring of €1.7m (2016: €3.1m).

Stock Spirits Group PLC 
Annual Report & Accounts 2017  Group tax provisions total €7.5m for the year, an 
increase of €0.2m from 2016, see note 13 for further 
details. Post-IPO, the Group completed corporate 
restructuring transactions involving intangible assets 
which gave rise to a significant deferred tax asset 
which was being amortised over a five-year period. 
Due to tax legislation changes in Poland, from 
1 January 2018, amortisation of these intangible 
assets is no longer deductible for tax purposes. This 
has resulted in an exceptional tax charge of €4.7m.
Exceptional items
Profit for the year at €11.3m (2016: €28.4m) 
declined in the year due to two exceptional items. 
At the interim announcement we referred to 
continuing challenges facing our Italian business, 
namely impacting Keglevich, our vodka-based 
flavoured liqueur brand. Whilst the Group is 
investing in the brand, the continued decline 
of the business has resulted in a non-cash 
impairment charge against the carrying value  
of the Italian business of €14.9m. 
The second exceptional item was the one-off 
deferred tax charge of €4.7m in Poland as  
outlined above.
Both items are non-cash adjustments.
Earnings per share
The basic earnings per share for the year to 
31 December 2017 was €0.06 per share versus 
€0.14 per share in 2016. Adjusted basic EPS, 
eliminating the effect of the exceptional items 
in the year, was €0.16 per share, an increase of 
some 14.3%.
Underlying corporate overheads, excluding PSP, 
share based payments and restructuring costs 
have declined by more than 26% year-on-year 
on a constant currency basis, delivering on 
commitments made previously. 
For performance management purposes, 
the Group uses Adjusted EBITDA as a key 
measure. The combination of improved revenue 
performance and benefits from the restructuring 
initiatives reflect delivery of the turnaround 
plans outlined over the past two years, Adjusted 
EBITDA rose 9.5% to €56.3m (2016: €51.4m). 
Details of the adjustments reconciling Adjusted 
EBITDA to operating profit are in note 7 to the 
consolidated financial statements.
As reported previously, the Group does not 
expect a material impact from the UK’s exit from 
the European Union. This will continue to be 
monitored similar to all primary risks that the 
Group faces (see page 20).
Finance income and expense and taxation
Net finance income and expense was broadly 
similar to the prior year at an underlying cost 
of around €2.6m as the financing facilities are 
unchanged. However, in 2016 there was a foreign 
exchange gain on intercompany loans of €1.4m 
which resulted in the reported net cost of €1.0m. 
The income tax expense, as detailed in note 13 of the 
consolidated financial statements, reflects a number 
of factors, primarily being: the current year tax 
expense, changes in provisions for taxation relating 
to prior years and movements in deferred tax.

Financial review continued
Irish whiskey investment
In July 2017 the Group announced a 25% 
investment in Quintessential Brands Ireland 
Whiskey Limited (QBIWL) for cash consideration 
of up to €18.3m; with €15m paid initially, and 
the balance deferred dependent on certain 
future performance conditions. The deferred 
consideration has been treated as a discounted 
contingent liability, see note 24 to the consolidated 
financial statements. We are pleased to announce 
that we have secured, from the owners of our 
existing whiskey agency brands, the right to 
distribute the QBIWL brands in our markets. 
Cashflow and working capital
The Group continues to generate strong cashflow 
from operating activities. Using a measure by 
which we judge our underlying operational 
cashflow, the Group generated free cashflow 
of €48.6m (2016: €48.3m), representing a 
conversion rate from Adjusted EBITDA of 86.3% 
(2016: 94.1%). The lower conversion rate reflects 
us leveraging our cashflow strength to gain 
competitive advantage in Poland, without which 
conversion would have exceeded 100%. 
As stated in previous years, the peak trading 
period just prior to the year-end can make material 
differences to cashflow. Due to a combination of 
increased trading levels in Poland, and leveraging 
our cashflow capability for commercial advantage, 
we saw increased trade receivables at year-
end. This increase has been largely offset by an 
increase in payables due to a focus on using the 
Group’s scale in negotiating better commercial 
terms with our suppliers everywhere.
Dividend
The Board has proposed a dividend to 
shareholders which represents a progressive 
underlying increase year-on-year. An interim 
dividend was paid in September 2017 of 2.38 
€cents per share, an increase of 4.9% compared 
to the 2016 interim dividend of 2.27 €cents 
per share. A final dividend is proposed of 5.72 
€cents per share in 2017, an increase on the 
2016 final dividend of 5.0% (2016: 5.45 €cents 
per share). The 2017 dividend pay-out represents 
an underlying 4.9% year-on-year increase. Given 
the Irish whiskey investment of €15.0m, a special 
dividend is not proposed this year. Nevertheless, 
the total distribution of 8.10 €cents represents 
almost double the pay-out implied by the 
Group’s dividend reference point since IPO of 
35% of net free cashflow. In the interest of our 
shareholders, the Board has decided to no longer 
consider dividends in such terms, and instead 
pay progressive underlying dividends, subject to 
there being sufficient distributable reserves and 
adequate cash generation.
Net debt and maturity profile
The Group’s revolving credit facility (RCF), which 
was re-financed in 2015, was amended and 
re-stated in 2017, extending the arrangements 
to 2022. Debt can be drawn and repaid at the 
Group’s discretion without penalty or charge. 
Further details can be found in note 23 of the 
consolidated financial statements. At the year-end, 
€14.3m of the RCF is utilised to back excise duty 
guarantees in Italy and Germany.

The continued strong cashflow during the year 
resulted in net debt of €53.1m at the year-end,  
a decrease of €6.6m from December 2016, 
despite the €15.0m investment in Irish whiskey. 
Leverage fell to 0.94x from 1.16x at December 
2016. We also retain a factoring facility of €50m. 
The net debt bridge chart below sets out the 
evolution over 2017. Our relatively low leverage 
combined with the significant headroom in our 
bank facilities leaves us well placed to finance  
our strategic aspirations.
Foreign exchange
The Group remains exposed to the impact of 
foreign currency exchange movements, with the 
major trading currencies remaining the Polish Złoty 
and the Czech Koruna. How the Group manages 
this risk is outlined on page 23. At the year-end, 
there were no formal hedging instruments in 
place, as the arrangements reported at the interim 
results were fully unwound.
A net positive FX gain of €0.4m was reported within 
Adjusted EBITDA during the year. This has arisen 
on the appreciation of the Polish Złoty and Czech 
Koruna. The table on the previous page shows the 
stated currency versus the Euro.
Change of year-end
As already announced, the year-end moves to 
30 September in 2018. Accordingly, the Group 
will report a nine month period for 2018 (from 
1 January to 30 September), and thereafter a 
normal 12 month period, starting from 1 October 
2018 to 30 September 2019. However, in order 
to assist with the understanding of the underlying 
performance, it is intended to include proforma  
12 month reporting (with comparatives) with the 
30 September 2018 results. The interim results for 
the six months to 30 June 2018 will be published 
as usual. Further details are set out in the 2018 
Financial Calendar on page 176. 
Changes in accounting policies
The Group will adopt IFRS 15 (revenue from 
contracts with customers) from 1 January 2018. 
We have made an assessment of the impact of 
this change in accounting policy: if applied in 
2017 there would have been a minor reduction 
in revenue for the Group of approximately -1.7%. 
There is no impact on Adjusted EBITDA and the 
change in Adjusted EBITDA margin would have 
been a small improvement of 36bps.
The Group has adopted IAS 7 (disclosure initiative) 
with a disclosure in note 23, and will adopt IFRS 
9 (financial instruments) from 1 January 2018. 
There is not expected to be any material impact 
from this adoption. The Group will adopt IFRS 16 
(accounting for leases) from 1 October 2019.
Equity structure
There has been no change to the equity structure of 
the business in 2017, which remains at 200 million 
issued shares with a nominal value of £0.10 each.

Strategic Review Governance Financial Statements
53 Chairman’s letter
Dear Shareholders 
I am pleased to present our Corporate Governance report for the year ended 31 December 2017. As you can read in more 
detail in the Audit Committee Report, we have continued to strengthen the governance policies, controls and processes to 
support the growth strategy of the Group during the year, and the years to come.
The Board is firmly committed to ensuring that our corporate governance policies are complied with in all jurisdictions in 
which the Group operates, by setting up proper processes. We are convinced that strong corporate governance is good 
for our business and underpins the delivery of shareholder value. We believe that corporate governance structures and 
processes will help our business to perform in a more efficient and competitive way in the marketplace and will lead to strong 
relationships with all of our stakeholders.
In November 2017, Lesley Jackson (CFO) stepped down from the Board and following an external search process, Paul Bal 
was appointed as CFO in November 2017. Elisa Gomez de Bonilla (Group General Counsel & Company Secretary) decided 
not to return following a period of maternity leave; Steve Weatherley was promoted to Group General Counsel and Sally 
Kenward to Group Company Secretary. 
The Board acknowledges that with the departure of Lesley Jackson in November 2017 there are currently no women on 
the Board. Any future appointments will be made in line with the Board Diversity Policy and will continue to be made on 
merit and take into account diversity, in terms of gender and ethnicity, as well as the appropriate mix of skills, background, 
knowledge, international and industry experience.
As Chairman of the Board, I work with the Company Secretary to set the agenda for Board meetings. These are structured to 
ensure that sufficient time is spent on important matters, and all Directors have the opportunity to contribute. During the year, 
the Board discussed, reviewed and updated the Group’s refreshed strategy. The Board also regularly reviews, among other 
things, the performance of each of the markets and in particular Poland, our largest market and considers the principal risks and 
associated procedures and processes to mitigate them. Further detail on the principal risks can be found on pages 20 to 25.
Another area of focus for the Board was succession planning including actions to strengthen the pipeline through the 
development of the leadership framework. Management continued to work on the pool of emerging talent within the Group 
providing bespoke training and development plans to create a strong pipeline of internal candidates. 
In the second half of the year, an internal evaluation of the Board was carried out to review the performance of the Board, 
its Committees and the individual Directors, including the Chairman. The exercise was facilitated by the Company Secretary 
under my direction and details of the process and outcomes are shown on pages 58 and 59. I believe regular and appropriate 
Board and Committee evaluation is an area that is fundamental to improving Board effectiveness and ensuring objectives 
can be met. It enables us to review the effectiveness of individual Directors, the processes under which the Board operates, 
and the quality, timeliness and appropriateness of information submitted by management. In 2018 we will carry out an 
internal evaluation. 
Your Board regularly meets with Group Management, both at Board and Board Committee meetings 
and in other routine meetings, which enables the Non-Executive Directors (NEDs) to gain a good 
understanding of the business and what is happening on the ground. We believe that this is an 
essential requirement for Directors. We have set out in the following pages, details of how the Company 
has applied the main principles of the 2016 version of the UK Corporate Governance Code  
and its compliance with the various provisions.
David Maloney 
Chairman
7 March 2018

Stock Spirits Group PLC 
Annual Report & Accounts 2017  Introduction 
This report explains key features of the Company’s governance structure to provide a greater understanding of how the main 
principles of the UK Corporate Governance Code, published in 2016 by the Financial Reporting Council (the Code), have 
been applied, and to highlight areas of focus during the year. The report also includes items required by the Disclosure and 
Transparency Rules. A copy of the Code can be obtained at www.frc.org.uk.
Compliance with the UK Corporate Governance Code
The Company has complied with the provisions of the Code in this financial year.
Governance overview
The Board is collectively responsible to the shareholders for the long-term success of the Company. The Board has delegated 
certain responsibilities to Board Committees to assist it with discharging its duties. The Board Committees play an essential 
role in supporting the Board to implement its vision and strategy, and to provide focused oversight of key aspects of the 
business. The full terms of reference for each Committee are available on the Company’s website www.stockspirits.com.
How the Board works
The Board 
The Company is led and controlled by the Board. The names, responsibilities and details of the current Directors  
appointed to the Board are set out on pages 52 and 53. The Board agrees the strategic direction and governance  
structure that will help achieve the long-term success of the Company and deliver shareholder value. The Board takes  
the lead in areas such as strategy, financial policy and ensuring the Company maintains a sound system of internal control.  
The Board’s full responsibilities are set out in the ‘Matters Reserved for the Board’ and are available on the Company’s 
website www.stockspirits.com
Role of the Chairman
The Board is chaired by David Maloney, a NED who met the independence criteria in the Code on his appointment. It is the 
Chairman’s duty to lead the Board and to ensure Directors have sufficient resources available to them to fulfil their statutory 
duties. The Chairman is responsible for setting the Board’s agenda, ensuring adequate time is available for discussion of all 
agenda items and ensuring a particular focus on strategic issues.
The Chairman promotes a culture of openness and debate by facilitating the effective contribution of NEDs in particular, and 
by encouraging constructive relations between Executive Directors and NEDs.
Role of the Chief Executive Officer (CEO)
Mirek Stachowicz is the CEO. Through delegation from the Board, he is responsible for executive management of the Group, 
including the implementation of the Group’s strategic objectives. In fulfilling his duties, the CEO is supported by the senior 
management team, whom he also leads.
Interaction between the Chairman and the CEO
The roles of the Chairman and the CEO are separate, with a distinct division of responsibilities.
The partnership between David Maloney and Mirek Stachowicz is based on mutual trust and is facilitated by regular contact 
between the two. The separation of authority enhances independent oversight of the executive management by the Board 
and helps to ensure that no one individual on the Board has unfettered authority.
Corporate governance framework
Strategic Review Governance Financial Statements
55 Role of the Senior Independent Director (SID)
John Nicolson is the SID and is available to shareholders if they have concerns that the normal channels of Chairman, CEO 
or other Executive Directors have failed to resolve, or for which such channels of communication are inappropriate. The 
SID also acts as an internal sounding board for the Chairman, and serves as intermediary for the other Directors, with the 
Chairman, when necessary. During the year Mr Nicolson consulted with major shareholders to discuss the proposed changes 
to the Directors’ Remuneration Policy both prior to and following the AGM. The role of the SID is considered to be an 
important check and balance in the Group’s governance structure. In accordance with the Code, neither the Chairman nor 
the SID are employed as executives of the Group.
Non-Executive Director independence 
The Board considers and reviews each NED’s independence on an annual basis, as part of the Directors’ performance 
evaluation. In carrying out the review, consideration is given to factors such as their character, judgement, commitment and 
performance on the Board and relevant Committees, and their ability to provide objective challenge to management. The 
Board has considered the findings from the internal Board evaluation exercise and reviewed the independence of each NED. 
The Board is of the view that all were and continue to be, independent in accordance with the provisions of the Code, with 
the exception of Randy Pankevicz, who is considered non-independent. His status does not preclude him from making a full 
contribution to the Board. He has participated in all Board and Board Committee meetings.

3.  Mr Nicolson was unable to attend one Audit Committee and one Nomination Committee due to overseas business commitments
During 2017, certain Executive and Non-Executive Directors who are not Committee members attended Committee 
meetings by invitation (other than meetings where there would be a conflict). These details have not been included in  
the table. 
In addition to the scheduled Board meetings, the Board holds regular meetings by telephone, generally to review the financial results. 
Corporate governance framework continued
56
Stock Spirits Group PLC 
Annual Report & Accounts 2017  In the event that a Director is unable to attend a meeting, they will receive the papers scheduled for discussion at the relevant 
meeting, giving them the opportunity to raise any issues and give any comments to the Chairman in advance of the meeting.
The Board delegates authority to its Committees to carry out certain tasks on its behalf, so that it can operate efficiently 
and give the right level of attention and consideration to relevant matters. The composition and role of each Committee is 
summarised in each of the respective Committee reports.
Board composition, qualification and independence 
The Board is committed to high standards of corporate governance and as such, its composition, members’ experience, 
balance of skills and effectiveness are regularly reviewed to ensure the right mix of people are on the Board and its 
Committees. Following the retirement of Lesley Jackson and the appointment of Paul Bal as CFO, both on 7 November 
2017, the Board continues to comprise eight Directors: a Chairman (who, for the purposes of the Code, was independent on 
appointment); a SID; three Independent NEDs; one Non-Independent NED and two Executive Directors.
The Directors have a wide range of skills and experience including expertise in the food and drinks industry, within Europe 
and beyond.
Appointment and tenure
All NEDs, including the Chairman, serve on the basis of letters of appointment that are available for inspection at the 
Company’s registered office. The letters of appointment set out the expected time commitment of NEDs who, on 
appointment, undertake that they will have sufficient time to meet what is expected of them. 
The Executive Directors’ service contracts are also available for inspection at the Company’s registered office.
The Company does not place a term limit on a Director’s service, as all continuing Directors will present themselves for annual 
re-election by shareholders at the Company’s Annual General Meetings (AGMs).
Director induction and training 
The Chairman, with the support of the Company Secretary, is responsible for the induction of new Directors and the ongoing 
training and development of all Directors. New Directors receive a full, formal and tailored induction on joining the Board, 
designed to provide an understanding of the Group’s business, governance and key stakeholders. The induction process 
includes site visits, meetings with key individuals, and briefings on key business, legal and regulatory issues facing the Group.
As the internal and external business environment changes, it is important to ensure the Directors’ skills and knowledge are 
refreshed and updated regularly. Accordingly the Chairman, with the assistance of the Company Secretary, ensures that 
regular updates on corporate governance, regulatory and technical matters are provided to Directors at Board meetings. 
During the year, operational site visits for the Board were arranged in Poland, Czech Republic and Italy which included 
meetings with the local senior management teams. In this way, Directors keep their skills and knowledge relevant so as to 
enable them to continue to fulfil their duties effectively.
Strategic Review Governance Financial Statements
57 Information and support available to Directors
All Board Directors have access to the Company Secretary, who advises them on Board and governance matters.
The Chairman and the Company Secretary work together to ensure Board papers are clear, accurate, delivered in a timely 
manner to Directors and of sufficient quality to enable the Board to discharge its duties. As well as the support of the 
Company Secretary, there is a procedure in place for any Director to take independent professional advice at the Company’s 
expense in the furtherance of their duties, where considered necessary.
Director re-election 
In accordance with the Code and the Directors’ letters of appointment, the Directors will put themselves forward for annual 
re-election. Following recommendations from the Nomination Committee, the Board considers that all Directors continue to 
be effective, committed to their roles and to have sufficient time available to perform their duties. Accordingly, all Directors 
will seek re-election at the Company’s forthcoming AGM. 
Directors’ conflicts of interest
Directors have a statutory duty to avoid situations in which they have, or may have, interests that conflict with those of the 
Company, unless that conflict is first authorised by the Board. This includes potential conflicts that may arise when a Director takes 
up a position with another company. The Company’s Articles allow the Board to authorise such potential con flicts, and there is a 
procedure in place to deal with any actual or potential con flict of interest. The Board deals with each appointment on its individual 
merit and takes into consideration all relevant circumstances. All potential conflicts approved by the Board are recorded in an 
Interests Register, which is reviewed by the Board at least quarterly to ensure the procedure is working effectively.
Board evaluation and effectiveness 
An internal evaluation of the performance of the Board, its Committees and the Chairman was carried out during the year. 
The process of evaluating the performance was undertaken by the Company Secretary under the direction of the Chairman. 
A tailored, high-level questionnaire was distributed for the Directors to complete. This was structured to provide Directors 
with an opportunity to express their views about: 
• The performance of the Board and its Committees, including how the Directors work together as a whole;
• The balance of skills, experience, independence and knowledge of the Directors; and
• Individual performance, and whether each Director continues to make an effective contribution.
Following evaluation, it was agreed that all Directors contribute effectively, demonstrate a high level of commitment to 
their role, and together provide the skills and experience that are relevant and necessary for the leadership and direction 
of the Company.
The evaluation highlighted that following Mrs Jackson’s departure, the Board is currently lacking in gender diversity, however, 
it is diverse in terms of ethnicity, culture, nationality and international experience. In line with the Board Diversity Policy, 
gender diversity will be considered alongside race, merit, skills, background, knowledge and international and industry 
experience when the next opportunity arises on the Board. 
The responses to the evaluation of the Board and its Committees were reviewed with the Chairman and considered by the 
Board. The results of the evaluation indicated that the Board is working well and that there were no significant concerns 
among the Directors about its effectiveness. It was generally felt that the actions agreed as a result of the previous year’s 
external evaluation had been progressed. These actions included succession planning and promoting a stronger culture of 
value creation in the Board and throughout the Company. For the year ahead, the actions agreed included a continued focus 
on succession planning, continued engagement with the management teams in each market and a focus on improving the 
management information provided to the Board.
Corporate governance framework continued
58
Stock Spirits Group PLC 
Annual Report & Accounts 2017  The results of the evaluation of the Chairman’s performance were considered by the SID and were discussed with the 
Chairman at a separate one-to-one meeting. The performance of individual Directors was evaluated by the Chairman,  
with input from the Committee Chairmen and other Directors. 
For 2018, an internal evaluation of the performance of the Board, its Committees and the Chairman will take place.  
The process of evaluation will be undertaken by the Company Secretary under the direction of the Chairman.
Annual General Meeting (AGM)
The Company’s AGM will take place at 11.30am on Tuesday, 22 May 2018 at the offices of Numis Securities Limited at The 
London Stock Exchange Building, 10 Paternoster Square, London, EC4M 7LT. All shareholders have the opportunity to attend 
and vote, in person or by proxy, at the AGM. The notice of the AGM can be found on our website www.stockspirits.com, and 
in a booklet that is being issued at the same time as this Report. The Notice of the AGM sets out the business of the meeting 
and an explanatory note on all resolutions. Separate resolutions are proposed in respect of each substantive issue.
The AGM is the Company’s principal forum for communication with shareholders. The Chairman of the Board and Directors 
will be available to answer shareholders’ questions at the AGM.
Committees
The Company has established an Audit Committee, a Nomination Committee, a Remuneration Committee and a Disclosure 
Committee. The Board delegated specific responsibilities to these Committees. The role and responsibilities of each Board 
Committee are set out in formal Terms of Reference, which are available on the Company’s website. The Board Committees 
make recommendations to the Board as they see fit, as contemplated by their Terms of Reference.
Shareholder engagement
The Company has regular discussions with and briefings for analysts, investors and institutional shareholders. Primary 
responsibility for shareholder relations rests with Mirek Stachowicz, CEO and Paul Bal, CFO. They ensure there is effective 
communication with shareholders on matters such as governance and strategy, and are responsible for ensuring the Board 
understands the views of major shareholders on such matters.
As part of a comprehensive investor relations programme, formal meetings with investors are scheduled to discuss the 
Group’s interim and final results. In the intervening periods, the Company continues its dialogue with the investor community 
by meeting key investor representatives and attending investor conferences.
During the year, the CFO and CEO met with a number of shareholders and potential shareholders. External presentations are 
posted on the Company’s website at www.stockspirits.com/investors.
The Chairman is always available to meet individual shareholders on request. In addition, all Directors are available to meet 
shareholders at the Company’s AGM.

59 Audit Committee report
I am pleased to report on the role and activities of the Audit Committee for the year
The principal objectives of the Committee are to monitor the Group’s internal controls and financial risk management, to review 
the integrity of the Group’s published financial reports, including the ARA, and to oversee the conduct of the external audit.
The Audit Committee is satisfied that it is in compliance with the provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code in 
relation to Audit Committees and auditors.
The Committee has complied with the Competition and Markets Authority Order on Statutory Audit Services for Large 
Companies for the year ended 31 December 2017, having completed a formal competitive tender process for the 
appointment of the external auditor during the year ended 31 December 2014.
Composition of the Committee
During the year ended 31 December 2017, the Audit Committee held five meetings. The members of the Committee during 
the year were as follows:
Mike Butterworth Chairman and Independent NED
John Nicolson Senior Independent NED
Tomasz Blawat Independent NED
All the members of the Committee are independent and collectively have competence relevant to the beverage sector in which the 
Company operates, in accordance with Provision C.3.1 of the UK Corporate Governance Code. Mike Butterworth is a chartered 
accountant and the Board is satisfied that he brings recent and relevant financial experience to the Committee, as recommended 
by the Corporate Governance Code, having served as CFO of a FTSE 250 company for eight years until December 2012.
Sally Kenward (Company Secretary) served as Secretary to the Committee with the exception of two meetings where Steve 
Weatherley (Group General Counsel) acted as Secretary to the meeting whilst in his capacity as Acting Company Secretary. 
The Chairman of the Company, NEDs not on the Audit Committee, CEO, CFO, Head of Internal Audit, Risk and Compliance, 
and audit engagement partner from our external auditor generally attend our Audit Committee meetings by invitation. We 
also ask other members of senior management to present to the Committee as appropriate. 
Committee meetings are planned so as to enable review of trading statements, the half-yearly report and the ARA, with 
additional meetings taking place as necessary.
Responsibilities and role of the Audit Committee
The Committee’s main responsibilities are to oversee, monitor and make recommendations to the Board on:
• The effectiveness of the Group’s internal control and risk management, including control over 
financial reporting
• The effectiveness of internal audit, including co-ordination with the activities of external audit
• The Group’s policies and procedures relating to business conduct, including whistle-blowing 
arrangements and fraud prevention and detection procedures
• The Group’s overall approach to ensuring compliance with laws, regulations and policies
• The appointment of the external auditor, including a tender selection process, where appropriate, 
as well as terms of engagement and remuneration
• The scope of the external audit, its findings and the effectiveness of the audit process
• The overall relationship with the external audit firm, including the provision of non-audit services 
to ensure that independence and objectivity are maintained
60
Stock Spirits Group PLC 
Annual Report & Accounts 2017  • The integrity of the financial statements, including a review of the significant accounting policies and financial reporting judgements
• Whether, taken as a whole, the ARA is fair, balanced and understandable and provides the information necessary for 
shareholders to assess the Group’s position and performance, business model and strategy.
Risk management and internal control framework
We have a clear framework for identifying, evaluating and managing risk faced by the Group on an ongoing basis, both at an 
operational and strategic level, which has been in place for the year under review and up to the date of this report, and which accords 
with ‘Guidance on Risk Management, Internal Control and Related Financial and Business Reporting’ issued by the Financial Reporting 
Council (FRC). Our risk identification and mitigation processes have been designed to be responsive to the constantly changing 
environment. Our internal control process starts with identifying risks, compliance matters and other issues at a local level in each 
of the Company’s markets, and then consolidates it at a Group level at the Board. We do this through routine reviews carried out by 
process owners and facilitated by relevant dedicated, specialist teams. We record risks in our risk registers, assess the implications and 
consequences for the Group, and determine the likelihood of occurrence. The Group’s risk register is subject to regular review and 
scrutiny by the Board, as well as by the Audit Committee with regards to the financial risks. Appropriate action is taken to manage 
and mitigate the risks identified. The Audit Committee receives an update on risk management and internal controls at every meeting. 
The report includes significant changes in risk registers, personnel and systems changes that may impact upon controls; any detected 
breaches of controls or investigations into possible breaches; and any concerns reported via our speak-up hotline. 
The main features of the Group’s internal control and risk management systems in relation to the process for preparing 
consolidated accounts include:
• Organisational structure, delegations of authority and reporting lines
• Group accounting and control procedures, with a centralised Group finance function that provides direction and support 
to market finance teams as well as managing the Group consolidation and reporting requirements
• Budgetary process and financial review cycle, with a quarterly review of annual budget, business performance and 
assessment of risks
• Risk management through monitoring and maintenance of a risk register for each business unit
• Capital expenditure control
• Internal Audit regular reports on controls
• Competence and integrity of our personnel.
Effectiveness of internal controls
The Committee has reviewed the effectiveness of our risk management and internal control process, including financial 
reporting, to ensure it remains robust. The review covered all material controls, including financial, operational and 
compliance controls, in the financial period to 31 December 2017 and the period to the approval of this ARA. 
The full 'Terms of Reference of the Committee', which have been subject to review and updated during the course of the 
year are available on our website at www.stockspirits.com. 
The Committee’s role is primarily advisory: it reports its findings to the Board. Ultimate responsibility for internal control, the 
ARA, half-yearly reports and trading statements remains with the Board.
Main activities of the Committee during the year
Internal controls and risk management
As part of our continuous monitoring of risk management and internal controls, we receive and review the corporate risk 
register together with a report on changes in significant risks in our main businesses and other control related information on 
a quarterly basis. Over the year, we have reviewed reports from the CEO and the Company Secretary, as well as from other 
members of management and the internal audit team.
Strategic Review Governance Financial Statements
61 Audit Committee report continued
At each meeting, the Committee continued to review progress on a major project that was initiated in 2015, to develop and 
implement more comprehensive controls across the business. This has involved cross functional teams across our principal 
markets challenging and redeveloping procedures and controls to ensure they are effective and not open to misuse. The process 
of implementing and embedding this enhanced internal control framework across all our markets has, following implementation 
in our German distillery, been completed and the ongoing internal audits of compliance with the controls are now producing 
very high pass rates in all markets. With this enhanced control framework now in place in all our principal markets, the focus in 
2017 has been on the extensive auditing of the controls to ensure that they are operating effectively. 
In addition, the Committee reviewed a number of matters relevant to the financial structure of the Group. These included 
the adequacy of the Group’s financing facilities, updates on the Group’s risk management and insurance programmes, the 
availability of distributable reserves within the Company and its ability to pay dividends. 
Internal audit
The remit of internal audit is to undertake financial, operational and strategic audits across the Group using a risk-based 
methodology. During the year, Monika Krenz was appointed as Head of Internal Audit, following the appointment of the 
previous Head of Internal Audit to the role of Group General Counsel, and Deloitte replaced PricewaterhouseCoopers as 
our internal audit service providers. In line with our usual practice, internal audit prepared an inventory of the key auditable 
control and risk areas across the Group, informed by the Principal Risks identified in our ARA and the latest quarterly risk 
registers prepared by our businesses, which drove priorities for the internal audit plan for 2017. This plan contained audits 
and reviews focused on areas identified as having the most risk to the business, covering all parts of the Group down to 
individual sites, processes and activities, and all aspects of the business. 
During 2017, the main focus of internal audit activity continued to be on extensive auditing post-implementation of the 
controls project referred to above in our principal markets, to ensure compliance with controls is fully embedded. The results 
of the post-implementation audits were reported to the Committee, as it continued to provide strong oversight for this 
important project. During the year, the remit of the controls project was extended from its initial focus on the purchase-to-
pay, order-to-cash and hire-to-retire processes, to additionally cover the sales and operations planning process. In addition, 
the Committee received internal audit reports on the design and operating effectiveness of controls around compliance with 
the Listing Rules of the London Stock Exchange and Market Abuse Regulation and health and safety management. In each 
case, the audits confirmed the general adequacy of controls and proposed areas for improvement. Results were graded, and 
where improvements were identified, appropriate remedial actions were agreed with the management concerned, with the 
Committee ensuring that these are followed up. We considered the internal control issues raised in internal audit reports that 
we received during the year, the adequacy of internal audit resources and the effectiveness of the internal audit function. 
The Committee also held a session with the Head of Internal Audit without other members of management being present. 
Whistle-blowing
Part of our remit is to oversee the Group’s processes for handling reports from whistle-blowers. Our Code of Business 
Conduct encourages all employees to report any potential improprieties in financial reporting or other matters. We have 
an independent compliance hotline (Speak-Up) operated by an external agency. This is available to all employees, suppliers, 
customers and other stakeholders, in each of the languages used throughout the Group and, subject to legal requirements, 
callers can remain anonymous if they wish. All contacts received are reported to and reviewed by the Audit Committee. 
Where appropriate, our legal and/or internal audit teams may be asked to investigate issues and report to us on the outcome. 
During 2017, we received only one Speak-Up hotline contact, which related to an alleged conflict of interest between 
an employee in Poland and a supplier. However, when we investigated the allegation, the informant provided no specific 
information and we found no evidence to suggest any wrongdoing.
The Committee also received regular updates from the Group General Counsel on significant litigation and disputes, initiated 
by or against the Company.

Annual Report & Accounts 2017  Review of ARA and preliminary results announcement
The Committee has considered the appropriateness of the accounting policies used. Further, the Committee carried out a 
comprehensive review of the ARA as a whole and considered a number of factors, including the balance between reporting of 
positive and negative aspects, consistency throughout the ARA and the results of enquiries made of business unit managers and 
other relevant management of the most significant challenges, set-backs and achievements during the year. Based on that review, 
the Committee has recommended to the Board that, taken as a whole, the ARA is fair, balanced and understandable, and provides 
the information necessary for shareholders to assess the Group’s position and performance, business model and strategy. 
Significant issues considered in relation to the ARA
In reviewing the financial statements with management and the auditors, the Committee has discussed and debated the 
critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty set out in note 4 to the financial statements. As a 
result of their review, the Committee has identified the following issues that require particular judgement or have significant 
impact on interpretation of this ARA.
Revenue recognition 
In the Group’s main markets, seasonal sales peaks occur around the Christmas period, therefore procedures for appropriate cut-
off and recording of revenue and related rebates to the correct period are important. In line with normal practice, the businesses 
within the Group provide a variety of discounts, rebates, promotions and marketing support to customers across a number of 
geographies. We reviewed the procedures performed by management and the auditors to ensure the accuracy and completeness 
of such reserves at the year-end. The Group’s policy is set out in note 3 to the consolidated financial statements.
Carrying value of intangible assets 
The Group’s policies on accounting for separately acquired intangible assets and goodwill on acquired businesses, are set 
out in note 3 to the consolidated financial statements. The results of this year’s testing showed positive headroom in all 
cash generating units, with the exception of Italy, where the continued low profitability resulted in a deficit of approximately 
€14.9m below the net asset value, requiring an impairment charge which is shown in the financial statements as an 
exceptional item due to its size and infrequent occurrence.
As part of the testing, the Committee has reviewed the key assumptions behind these valuations, notably the expected 
development of future cashflows and the discount rates used, as well as considering reasonable sensitivities to these 
estimates, and concluded that these support the carrying values set out in notes 15 and 16. 
Taxation 
As is normal, the Group has a number of outstanding tax assessments, and regularly undertakes reviews to assess tax risks 
across the Group – for example, risks associated with VAT and transfer pricing. As described in note 13 to the consolidated 
financial statements, we are facing a number of tax investigations at subsidiary level. The Group has undertaken a review of 
potential tax risks and current tax assessments, and while it is not possible to predict the outcome of any pending enquiries, 
the Committee concurs with management’s assessment of the changes to provisions made during the year.
Going concern
In assessing whether the Company is a going concern, and accordingly making our recommendation to the Board, we 
considered a paper prepared by management based on guidance published by the Financial Reporting Council and 
reviewed the findings of the external auditors. The assessment was made for the period of 12 months from the date of this 
report, in accordance with accepted practice. Based on internal forecasts, we reviewed the Group’s debt-maturity profile, 
including headroom and compliance with financial covenants, and its capital structure. We stress-tested this by adjusting 
the Company’s internal full-year forecast cashflow by a combination of the principal risks we have identified – notably an 
economic downturn leading to loss of revenue and customer default (see Principal Risks – Economic and Political Change; 
and Marketplace and Competition). See note 2 to the accounts (Going concern). The Committee concluded that the 
application of the going-concern basis for the preparation of the financial statements remained appropriate.
Strategic Review Governance Financial Statements
63 Changes to accounting standards
The Committee reviewed analysis and proposals from the Group finance team on the implementation of several changes to 
accounting standards starting on or after 1 January 2018. These are outlined in note 3 to the financial statements and the 
Committee concurs with the assessments of the impacts, which are deemed to not be material. 
External audit
During the year, the Audit Committee assessed the ongoing effectiveness and quality of the external audit process on the 
basis of a questionnaire-based internal review completed by members of the Audit Committee, the external auditors and key 
members of the finance team. The Committee concluded that the audit process was effective, while identifying a number of 
learnings that will be applied to future audits as part of our commitment to continuous improvement. 
The Committee maintained a dialogue with our external auditors, KPMG, on the key financial statement risks on which the 
half-year review and full-year audit would focus. KPMG’s approach to materiality informed discussion of the appropriate level 
of materiality for the audit, and the Committee concurred with KPMG’s proposals as set out in their report. The Committee 
continued to meet regularly with the external auditors in the absence of management.
Before concluding our recommendation on the ARA in March 2018, we reviewed a report from KPMG on the findings from their 
audit with particular attention on key issues arising out of the audit, including their views on critical estimates and judgements, key 
assumptions, clarity of disclosures and proposed audit adjustments. We discussed these with management and satisfied ourselves 
that the issues raised had been properly dealt with. We received and considered confirmation of the independence and objectivity 
of the auditors, and reviewed the effectiveness of the audit process by interrogation of management and auditors. The Committee 
also sought assurance from management that all appropriate matters had been brought to the auditors’ attention. 
Non-audit services policy and auditor independence 
We have a policy on non-audit services provided by the external auditors, which was updated in line with EU Regulation No. 
537/2014 on the statutory audit of public interest entities. Specific approval must be sought from the Audit Committee for:
• Single or linked advice from our auditors, the cost of which is likely to exceed €50,000 in the financial year or bring the 
aggregate non-audit fee for that firm over €300,000 in the financial year; and
• Employment into control positions of individuals who have worked directly on the external audit in the previous two years.
Our policy also states that we require annual confirmation of the independence of an audit firm in accordance with its own 
and required regulatory and ethical guidelines. We review a quarterly report from the CFO of the actual level and nature of 
non-audit work and periodic confirmation from KPMG of their independence. 
The total fees paid to KPMG for audit services for the year were €676,000 and audit-related assurance services fees amounted to 
€54,000. The audit-related assurance services work entirely comprised of a half year interim review. We are satisfied that this audit-
related assurance services work did not detract from the objectivity and independence of our external auditors. Further details of the 
fees paid to the external auditors are set out in note 12.
Governance
The Committee has reported in accordance with its Terms of Reference and in particular has recommended to the Board the 
adoption of the ARA and the proposal to reappoint KPMG LLP as independent auditors at the AGM. A formal evaluation of 
the effectiveness of the Committee was carried out during the year (see page 58); based upon the results of that evaluation, 
the Committee believes that it has operated effectively during the year.

Annual Report & Accounts 2017  Nomination Committee report
I am pleased to present the report of the Nomination Committee for 2017. 
Composition of the Committee
The members of the Committee are:
David Maloney Chairman 
John Nicolson Senior Independent NED
Mike Butterworth Independent NED
Diego Bevilacqua Independent NED
Meetings
The Nomination Committee met four times during the year. David Maloney, John Nicolson, Mike Butterworth and Diego 
Bevilacqua met the independence criteria in the Code on appointment. Sally Kenward (Company Secretary) served as 
Secretary to the Committee, except for two meetings where Steve Weatherley (Group General Counsel) acted as Secretary 
whilst in his capacity as Acting Company Secretary. The CEO and NEDs who do not sit on the Committee generally attend 
our Committee meetings by invitation (other than when there would be a conflict). We also ask other members of the senior 
management team, such as the Group HR Director, to present to the Committee during the year. 
Responsibilities and roles of the Committee 
The Nomination Committee is responsible for regularly reviewing the structure, size and composition (including the 
skills, knowledge, independence and experience) required of the Board compared to its current position, and making 
recommendations to the Board with regard to any changes; giving full consideration to succession planning for Directors, 
taking into account the challenges and opportunities facing the Company, and the skills and expertise that will therefore, be 
needed on the Board in the future; and identifying and nominating for the approval of the Board, candidates to fill Board 
vacancies as and when they arise. 
The Nomination Committee takes into account the provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code 2016 (the Code) and 
any regulatory requirements that are applicable to the Company. It ensures that external evaluations of the Board are carried 
out according to the applicable regulations. The full 'Terms of Reference of the Committee' are available on our website  
www.stockspirits.com. 
Main activities of the Committee during the year
The Committee met in March 2017 to determine Directors’ independence or non-independence 
for the purpose of recommending to the Board the reappointment of Directors at the AGM. 
Succession planning and development of senior management pipeline
In June and November 2017 the Committee met to discuss and agree the succession planning 
of senior management, both in terms of permanent succession and also short-term cover 
for senior roles. Succession planning is a key area for the Company and continues to be 
enhanced and developed. Emerging talent within the middle management team was discussed 
and individual development plans have been put in place to strengthen the pipeline for the 
future. Effective succession planning is fundamental to Board effectiveness and ensures there is 
continuous development of talented personnel to provide cover in the short-term and promotion, 
where appropriate, into senior positions in the long term. This approach helps to mitigate the risks 
associated with unforeseen events such as the departure of a key individual, and also assists in 
promoting diversity. 
Strategic Review Governance Financial Statements
65 At the meeting held in January 2017, the Chairman recommended introducing a mentoring programme between the 
NEDs and the senior management team. The programme was established to help the NEDs gain a greater understanding 
of a particular area of the business and to also provide advice to the individual where required. Everyone involved in the 
programme has found the exercise beneficial and the plan is to continue the mentoring programme in 2018. The Committee 
will continue to focus on succession planning and development of both middle and senior management during 2018. 
Board Changes
Following Mrs Jackson’s notification to the Committee that she intended to step down from the Board from November 2017, 
the Nomination Committee conducted an external search through Odgers Berndtson, an international executive search firm, 
who were given a brief to provide a diverse long list of candidates taking into account gender, ethnicity, skill, experience, 
background, knowledge, international and industry experience. The Committee agreed a short list of candidates and a 
number of interviews were conducted by the members of the Nomination Committee and other Board Directors. Following 
the final interviews with candidates, the Nomination Committee proposed to the Board, and the Board unanimously agreed, 
to appoint Paul Bal as CFO of the Company in November 2017. 
Diversity
Following Mrs Jackson’s retirement and Mr Bal’s appointment to the Board, there are currently no females on the Board. The 
Board is diverse in terms of the race, nationality and international experience of its members. The Committee will continue 
to monitor and consider diversity for future Board appointments and it is the Company’s policy to maintain and develop the 
diversity of its Board Directors without compromising on the calibre of new Directors appointed. Appointments to the Board 
will be based on merit while complementing and enhancing the existing diversity of skills, knowledge, and experience of the 
Board as a whole. 
The Nomination Committee will continue to engage with Executive Search firms in a manner which enhances opportunities 
for diverse candidates to be considered for appointment; the Committee will support Board-level diversity throughout 
the Succession Planning process and will support efforts to increase diversity in the senior management pipeline towards 
Executive and Non-Executive Board positions.
In accordance with the recommendation for FTSE 350 companies set out in the Code, all of the Company’s Directors will 
stand for re-election at the forthcoming AGM. The biographical details of the current Directors can be found on pages 52 
and 53. The Committee considers that the performance of each of the Directors standing for re-election continues to be 
effective and that they each demonstrate commitment to their role, including commitment of time for Board and Committee 
meetings and any other duties.
The terms and conditions of appointment of NEDs, including the expected time commitment, are available for inspection at 
the Company’s registered office.

Annual Report & Accounts 2017  I am pleased to present our Remuneration Report for 2017. 
Our Directors’ remuneration policy (the Policy) was approved at the AGM in 2017 with a vote in favour of more than 79%, 
and applied during the year. As noted in the 2016 Directors’ Remuneration Report, we consulted with major shareholders 
and representative bodies in respect of the proposed changes to the Policy and in my position as Chairman of the 
Committee I spoke with a number of the Company's largest shareholders following the AGM. No changes to the Policy  
are proposed for 2018. 
The Annual Report on remuneration (pages 77 to 84) sets out how the Policy was applied in 2017 and details the rewards 
earned by Directors. It also sets out how we intend to apply the Policy in 2018. 
As no changes are proposed to the Directors’ remuneration policy this year, it will not be subject to a vote at the AGM.  
The Annual Report on remuneration will be subject to an advisory vote by shareholders at the AGM. 
The outturn for 2017 can be summarised as follows: 
• Base salary 
  Mirek Stachowicz’s salary for 2017 remained at the level of £425,000 (€482,955) as reported last year. Paul Bal was 
appointed as CFO during the year with a salary of £300,000 (€340,909), which is less than the salary earned by the 
former CFO. Further information in relation to Paul Bal’s remuneration on joining the Company is set out below. 
• Annual bonus
  Mirek Stachowicz’s and Lesley Jackson’s bonus opportunity for 2017 was up to 140% of salary. The bonus was based 
on three performance metrics: (1) EBITDA (50% of the opportunity); (2) cashflow (30% of the opportunity); and (3) 
individual KPIs linked to the financial, strategic and operational performance of the business (20% of the opportunity). 
Performance achieved against the two financial measures of EBITDA and cashflow conversion was between threshold 
and target. This has resulted in an annual bonus being paid to Mirek Stachowicz and Lesley Jackson at 32.1% of salary; 
further information is included on page 78. 25% of the bonus earned by Mirek Stachowicz will be deferred into shares. 
In line with the Directors’ remuneration policy and as agreed in connection with her retirement from the Board,  
all of Lesley Jackson’s bonus will be paid in cash. Paul Bal was not eligible for a bonus in respect of 2017. 
• LTIP (Long Term Incentive Plan)
  The PSP (Performance Share Plan) award granted to Lesley Jackson in 2015 was subject to an EPS performance 
condition (as regards 50% of the award) and a TSR performance condition (as regards 50% of the award). 
Each performance condition was assessed over the three year performance period ended  
31 December 2017; the performance required for threshold vesting was not achieved and  
the award has lapsed. 
Executive Director changes
Lesley Jackson retired from the Board on 7 November 2017 and will leave the Company on  
8 August 2018. The remuneration arrangements in relation to Lesley’s retirement from the 
Board have been determined in accordance with the Policy; further information is set out  
on page 81. 
Paul Bal was appointed as CFO with effect from 7 November 2017. His salary was set at 
£300,000 (€340,909) which is lower than Lesley Jackson’s (£318,000 (€361,364)). We 
agreed to compensate Paul for incentive awards he forfeited in his previous role. Details 
of the compensation award are set out on page 80, the award will vest in December 2020 
and has been granted in the form of an award over the Company’s shares to align his 
interests with those of shareholders. 
Directors’ remuneration report
Strategic Review Governance Financial Statements
67 Remuneration for 2018 
An increase of 3% is proposed for Mirek Stachowicz for 2018 to a level of £437,750 (€497,443), this is in line with the range 
of increases awarded to the wider workforce. No change is proposed to Paul Bal’s base salary for 2018, which will remain at 
the level of £300,000 (€340,909).
The Executive Directors’ annual bonus opportunity and LTIP awards for 2018 will be pro-rated to reflect the shortened 2018 
financial year for the Company.
• The bonus opportunity will be up to 140% of salary earned during the nine month financial year from 1 January 2018 to 
30 September 2018 (i.e. up to 105% of the annualised salary); 25% of any bonus earned will be deferred into shares for 
two years. Further information is given on page 84. 
• PSP awards will be granted at the level of 125% of the pro-rated salary (i.e. 93.75% of the annualised salary). Awards will 
be subject to EPS and cash conversion targets as set out on page 84, and will be subject to a two year holding period 
after vesting. 
No changes are proposed in respect of fees for 2018 for the NEDs or the Chairman.
Because the Policy is not subject to a shareholder vote at the 2018 AGM, we have not included it in full in this year’s 
Directors’ Remuneration Report. We have set out below the parts of the Policy that we consider shareholders will find most 
useful, but with the "Reward Scenarios" on page 73 updated to reflect the application of policy in 2018. The full policy as 
approved at the Company’s Annual General Meeting on 23 May 2017 is set out on pages 77 to 84 of the Company’s 2016 
Annual Report and Accounts, which is available on the Company’s website at: https://www.stockspirits.com/investors/
results_reports_presentations/annual_report_2016.aspx
We remain committed to a responsible approach to executive pay as I trust that this Remuneration Report demonstrates, and 
value all shareholders’ views on our remuneration arrangements.

how each element of the package operates. The Committee ensures that the incentive structure to be applied does not raise 
environmental, social or governance risks by inadvertently motivating irresponsible behaviour.
Element Purpose and link to strategy Operation Maximum opportunity Performance measures
Salary To provide salaries that are 
sufficient to attract and retain 
experienced and capable 
Executives who can drive the 
business forward. In considering 
the base salary (and other 
elements of remuneration) 
of Executive Directors, the 
Committee takes due regard of 
the pay and conditions of the 
workforce generally.
Salaries are paid 
in equal monthly 
instalments and 
are normally 
reviewed on  
an annual basis.
No maximum salary has been set. However, 
any increase will normally be within the range 
of increases (in percentage terms) awarded 
to the wider workforce. Increases may be 
awarded above the level awarded to other 
employees in appropriate circumstances, 
which include but are not limited to:
• A change in the scope of the role
• An increase in the complexity or size of  
the business
• To take account of the individual’s 
performance in the role, which can include 
aligning a newly appointed Executive 
Director’s salary with the market over time 
• To take account of changes in market 
practice.

performance of the 
individual is taken into 
account when determining 
the amount of any increase.

of deferred share 
awards.
The annual bonus may be paid in 
cash or in deferred shares (under 
the DABP). The Committee’s 
current intention is for 25% of any 
bonus to be deferred under the 
DABP. However, under the rules 
of the ABP, the Committee may 
decide to satisfy up to 100% of the 
annual bonus in shares.
Where the amount of the bonus to 
be deferred into shares is less than 
£5,000, the Committee may pay 
the whole bonus in cash.
Any deferred shares will be granted 
in the form of nil (or nominal) cost 
options or conditional awards, 
and will normally be subject to a 
two year vesting period. Dividend 
equivalents may be payable on the 
deferred share awards in respect 
of dividends paid over the period 
from grant of the award to vesting 
calculated on such basis as the 
Committee shall determine, which

deferred share awards, malus 
provisions, will apply as referred 
to below.
Maximum annual bonus 
(including cash and deferred

The performance targets used for 
the annual bonus will be set by 
the Committee at the start of each

weightings used may vary from 
year to year to reflect changing 
business priorities. The measures 
will be based on financial 
performance and the individual 
Key Result Areas (KRAs) for each 
Executive, with at least 50% of 
the bonus opportunity being 
based on financial targets.
In the case of financial 
performance measures, there 
is no minimum bonus payment 
for threshold performance, 
with up to 50% of the maximum 
opportunity paid for target 
performance increasing to the full 
potential being paid for maximum 
performance. In the case of non-

the bonus will be earned between 
0% and 100% based on the

their original purpose.
Performance share awards
The Committee may, acting fairly and reasonably, vary performance conditions applying to existing PSP awards if an event 
has occurred that causes the Committee to consider that it would be appropriate to amend the performance conditions, 
and the varied conditions are not materially less challenging than the original conditions would have been but for the event 
in question.

71 Operation of incentive plans
The Committee has discretion to operate the PSP and DABP in accordance with their rules, including the ability to settle 
awards in cash in appropriate circumstances and to adjust awards in the event of a variation of the Company’s share capital 
or any other relevant event. 
Claw-back provisions
Claw-back provisions may be operated at the discretion of the Committee in respect of awards granted under the ABP, the 
DABP and the PSP in certain circumstances (including where there has been a material misstatement of accounts, an error 
in assessing any applicable performance condition or misconduct on the part of the participant). Claw-back may be operated 
during a period of two years following the vesting of a DABP award, or within two years following the payment of an ABP 
bonus. Claw-back may be applied during a period of two years following the vesting of a PSP award i.e. during the holding 
period. 
Malus provisions
Malus provisions may be operated at the discretion of the Committee in respect of awards granted under the DABP in 
certain circumstances (including where there has been a material misstatement of accounts, an error in assessing any 
applicable condition or misconduct on the part of the participant). Malus may be operated before the vesting of an award.
Differences in policy from the wider employee population
The Company’s approach to annual salary reviews is consistent across the Group. However, there are some differences 
between the policy for Executive Directors as set out above and its approach to payment of employees generally. For 
example, there is an increased emphasis on performance-related pay for Executive Directors through a higher annual 
bonus opportunity and participation in the PSP, plus a higher proportion of their total remuneration is also at risk. The 
Committee has not consulted directly with employees on the Executive remuneration policy, but it takes into account the 
pay and employment conditions of the general workforce when considering any changes to the quantum or structure of the 
Executive remuneration packages.
Non-Executive Directors
Purpose and link to strategy Operation Opportunity
To attract and retain high-calibre 
Non-Executive Directors by  
offering competitive fees.
Fees are paid on a per-annum basis and are not varied 
for the number of days worked. The fees are set 
to take into account the responsibilities of the role, 
the experience of the Chairman and NED and the 
expected time commitment involved.
Additional fees may be paid to reflect extra 
responsibilities such as for the SID or when acting 
as Chairman or a member of any of the Board 
Committees. 
The Chairman and NEDs may also be eligible to 
receive benefits relevant to their role such as travel 
costs and secretarial support, or other benefits that 
may be appropriate. 
The fee levels are usually 
reviewed biannually, and may be 
increased if appropriate to do so. 
The maximum aggregate fee to 
all Directors that may be paid is 
limited to the amount permitted 
under the Company’s Articles of 
Association from time to time.

Annual Report & Accounts 2017  Reward scenarios
The charts below show the potential reward available to the Executive Directors under the Policy, based on the application 
of the Policy in the shortened nine month financial year from 1 January 2018 to 30 September 2018. Although the Executive 
Directors are paid in Sterling, the charts have been presented in Euros using an exchange rate of 0.88, which is the Group’s 
reporting currency. The charts are prepared on the basis of the following assumptions.
• Fixed Pay is:
 – nine months of the € salary for 2018, as referred to on page 83;
 – a pension contribution at 15% of that salary; and
 – benefits calculated in the case of Mirek Stachowicz on the basis of nine months’ worth of his € value benefits for 
2017 as reported in the single figure of remuneration table on page 78 and in the case of Paul Bal nine months’ 
worth of Lesley Jackson’s € value benefits for 2017 as reported in the single figure of remuneration table on page 78 
(recognising that Paul Bal’s benefits figure for 2017 in the single figure of remuneration table is not for a full year).
• Annual Bonus for maximum performance is 140% of nine months of the € salary for 2018, with 50% of this maximum 
vesting for target performance.
• PSP for maximum performance is 125% of nine months of the € salary for 2018, as referred to on page 83, with 25% of 
this maximum vesting for target performance.
• No assumptions have been made as to possible share price growth or dividends earned in relation to shares.

73 Service contracts and letters of appointment
Each Executive Director has been appointed under a service contract. These contracts contain the following obligations on 
the Company that could give rise to, or impact on, remuneration payments or payments for loss of office:
• To provide pay, contributions to a pension scheme (or a cash allowance in lieu) and benefits as specified in the contract
• To give the Executive Director eligibility at the discretion of the Committee to participate in short- and long-term 
incentive plans
• To provide 30 working days’ paid holiday per annum, or pay in lieu of any accrued but untaken holiday on termination 
of employment
• To provide sick pay as specified in the contract
• To terminate the contract on not less than 12 months’ notice by either the Company or the Director or to make a 
payment in lieu of notice equal to value of the base salary either in one lump sum or in phased instalments and reduced 
by amounts earned from alternative remunerative positions obtained during the notice period.
• In the case of Mirek Stachowicz, to receive, subject to the prior agreement of the Company, of up to £4,500 per year in 
respect of legal and tax advice for the duration of his employment and for up to five years thereafter.
Each of the NEDs is appointed by letter of appointment for an initial term of three years. Their appointments may be 
terminated earlier without compensation on three months’ notice and are subject to annual re-election by the shareholders.
The Executive Directors’ service contracts and the NEDs’ letters of appointment are kept available for inspection at the 
Company’s registered office.
Payments for loss of office
In the event of an Executive Director’s departure, the Company will honour the contractual entitlements of that Director. 
The Company’s approach to payments for loss of office will be based on the following principles:
Notice period/pay in lieu
Executive Directors have rolling contracts with 12-month notice periods. The Company may elect to terminate employment 
immediately by making a payment in lieu of notice equivalent to the Executive Director’s salary for the notice period. The 
payment in lieu of notice may be made in monthly instalments, which can be reduced to the extent the Executive Director 
obtains alternative paid employment. All other benefits including pension contributions or allowance (as the case may be) will 
cease on termination, unless the Committee determines otherwise.
The Company may terminate a Director’s employment without notice (or payment in lieu) in certain circumstances, including 
where the Executive commits a serious breach of his or her service agreement or is found guilty of gross misconduct.
Outstanding incentive awards
Leavers
As a general rule, unvested incentive awards (e.g. outstanding PSP and DABP awards and entitlement to annual bonus) will 
lapse on a participant ceasing to hold employment or to be a Director within the Company’s Group.
Directors’ remuneration report continued
74
Stock Spirits Group PLC 
Annual Report & Accounts 2017  Good leavers
However, if the reason for the cessation of employment falls within certain good leaver categories (which include, for 
example, cessation due to a participant’s injury, disability, retirement, redundancy, the employing company or business being 
sold out of the Company’s Group) or in other circumstances at the discretion of the Committee, then the unvested incentive 
award may vest and be payable as set out below:
• PSP: Awards will usually vest on the normal vesting date subject to performance and time pro-rating and be released 
at the end of the originally envisaged holding period. The Committee retains the discretion not to time pro-rate if it 
considers it appropriate to do so. The Committee may allow the outstanding share award to vest and be released early to 
a good leaver and if a participant dies, his or her award will ordinarily vest and be released early (unless the Committee 
decides otherwise)
• Annual Bonus: A good leaver’s annual bonus for the year of cessation will ordinarily be paid in respect of the period 
of service during the year. Any payment will be subject to the performance conditions and be paid at the usual time, 
although the Committee retains discretion to make payments earlier in appropriate circumstances. Bonuses for the year 
of cessation or preceding year may be paid wholly in cash (with no deferral into shares) at the election of the Committee
• DABP: In the case of DABP awards, outstanding awards for a good leaver will vest early to such extent as the Committee 
determines appropriate.
• If a participant ceases employment after a PSP award has vested but during the holding period applying to it for any reason 
(other than summary dismissal, in which case his award will lapse), the holding period will usually continue until its originally 
scheduled end date, although the Committee retains discretion to bring the holding period to an end on cessation. 
Takeovers
In the event of a takeover or winding up of the Company (not being an internal corporate reorganisation), all unvested PSP 
awards will vest early, subject to: (i) performance and (ii) time pro-rating, although the Committee can decide to reduce or 
eliminate the pro-rating of a PSP award or to disapply (or partially disapply) any performance conditions if it regards it as 
appropriate to do so in the particular circumstances.
In the event of a takeover or winding up of the Company (not being an internal reorganisation), vested PSP awards which 
are subject to a holding period, will be released early to the extent already vested. In the event of a takeover or winding up 
of the Company, the Committee may allow bonuses for that financial year to be paid early, subject to: (i) the extent that the 
performance conditions have been satisfied at that time; and (ii) the pro-rating of the bonus to reflect the reduced period of 
time between grant and the date of such event, although the Committee can decide to reduce or eliminate the pro-rating of 
a bonus.
In the event of a takeover or winding up of the Company (not being an internal corporate reorganisation), all DABP awards 
will vest early in full.
Internal corporate reorganisation
In the event of an internal corporate reorganisation, PSP and DABP awards may, at the discretion of the Committee, be 
replaced by equivalent new awards over shares in a new holding company, provided that the Board of Directors of the new 
holding company agrees. If such replacement is not agreed before the internal corporate reorganisation takes place, then the 
PSP and DABP awards will vest on the basis that would apply in the case of a takeover.
Other payments and benefits
Outplacement services may be provided where appropriate and any statutory entitlements, sums to settle or compromise 
claims in connection with a termination would be paid as necessary, along with any accrued but untaken holiday and where 
appropriate, payments in respect of legal fees.
Strategic Review Governance Financial Statements
75 Directors’ remuneration report continued
Recruitment of Directors
Where a new Executive Director is appointed, the principles outlined above in relation to the structure, components and 
maximum opportunities of the existing Executive Directors’ remuneration package and service contract terms will also apply to 
any newly appointed Director. Salaries for new hires will be set to reflect their skills and experience, the Company’s intended 
pay positioning and the market rate for the role. In accordance with the above policy table, the maximum variable pay that may 
be offered is 265% of salary (390% in exceptional circumstances), excluding any “buy-out award” as referred to below.
It may be necessary to buy out incentive awards that would be forfeited on leaving the previous employer. In determining the 
structure of any buy-out award, the Committee will take into account the form of the awards forgone (cash or shares), the 
timing of the awards and their expected value. Replacement share awards, if used, may be granted under the PSP, although 
awards may also be granted outside of this scheme if necessary and as permitted under the Listing Rules.
The Committee may also alter the performance measures, performance period, vesting period and holding period of the 
annual bonus, DABP or PSP if the Committee determines that the circumstances of the recruitment merit such alteration. 
The rationale will be clearly explained in a subsequent Directors’ Remuneration Report. 
In the case of an internal promotion, any outstanding variable pay awarded in relation to the previous role will be allowed to 
pay out according to its terms of grant.
Fees for a new Chairman or NED will be set in line with the approved policy.
Non-Executive positions by Executive Directors
The Company’s policy is to allow the Executive Directors to take only one NED role in another company with prior 
consent from the Board, which cannot be unreasonably withheld. The Committee may permit an Executive Director to 
take on additional roles following the giving of notice to terminate his employment with the Company. During 2017, Mirek 
Stachowicz was a Non-Independent Member of the Supervisory Board of Paged S.A., for which he received a fee of 310,920 
PLN (€43,128).
Consideration of shareholder views
The Committee is committed to open and transparent dialogue with shareholders, and seeks major shareholder views in 
advance of proposing significant changes to its policy. The Committee considers shareholder feedback received in relation to 
the AGM each year plus, any additional feedback received during any meetings from time to time. When there are material 
issues relating to executive remuneration or proposed changes in policy, we engage actively with major shareholders to 
ensure we understand the range of their views.

Annual Report & Accounts 2017  Annual Report on Remuneration
This part of the report provides details of remuneration earned by Executive Directors in respect of 2017 and how the 
Remuneration Policy, which was approved at the 2017 AGM, will be implemented during 2018. It will be put to an advisory 
shareholder vote at the 2018 AGM. The information in this section has been audited where stated.
Role of the Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee determines and agrees with the Board the framework or broad policy for the remuneration of 
the Executive Directors and the senior management team. The remuneration of NEDs is a matter for the Chairman of  
the Board and the Executive Directors, subject to the constraints contained in the Company’s Articles of Association.  
No Director or Manager shall be involved in any decisions as to their own remuneration. 
The Remuneration Committee will determine the policy for and scope of service agreements, termination payments and 
compensation commitments for the Executive Directors and the senior management team. It also ensures that Directors’ 
contractual terms on termination are observed, ‘that failure is not rewarded’ and that the duty to mitigate loss is fully 
recognised. The Remuneration Committee will also agree the policy for authorising claims for expenses from the Directors.
The full Terms of Reference of the Remuneration Committee are available on our website at www.stockspirits.com.
Composition of the Remuneration Committee 
The members of the Remuneration Committee during the year were as follows: 
John Nicolson Chairman and SID
Mike Butterworth Independent NED
Diego Bevilacqua Independent NED
Tomasz Blawat Independent NED
During the year ended 31 December 2017 the Committee held six meetings.
All members of the Committee are independent. 
Sally Kenward (Company Secretary) served as Secretary to the Committee with the exception of two meetings where Steve 
Weatherley (Group General Counsel) served as Secretary whilst in his capacity as Acting Company Secretary. The Chairman 
and CEO generally attend our Committee meetings by invitation, but not for matters that affect them directly. We also asked 
other members of the senior management team (such as the Group HR Director) to present to the Committee during  
the year. 
Advice provided to the Committee
Deloitte LLP acted as adviser to the Committee during 2017. Deloitte is a founding member of the Remuneration Consultants 
Group and adheres to its Code of Conduct in relation to Executive remuneration consulting in the UK. Deloitte’s fees for 
advice to the Committee during 2017 were £21,750 (€24,716) plus VAT. 
The Committee reviewed the potential for conflicts of interest and the safeguards against them, and is satisfied that Deloitte 
does not have any such interests, or connections with the Group, that may impair its independence.

Long term incentives awarded in 2017
As discussed in the Committee Chairman’s statement last year, PSP awards in 2017 were granted at the level of 175% of 
salary. This reflected an “ordinary” grant at the reduced policy level of 125% of salary and an additional grant of 50% of 
salary recognising that awards were not granted in 2016. 
We also granted Paul Bal an award on his recruitment in respect of the 2017 annual bonus and share options he forfeited 
in his previous role. The award has been granted over Company shares to align his interests with those of shareholders. The 
value of the shares subject to the award was calculated by reference to the value of the forfeited remuneration as described 
above. We agreed with Paul that this award would be subject to a three year vesting period.
Paul Bal did not receive a PSP award in respect of 2017.

83 Annual bonus
For the financial year ending 30 September 2018, the Executive Directors’ bonus opportunity will be pro-rated to reflect the 
shortened financial period, so that the bonus opportunity will be up to 140% of the salary earned (i.e. up to 105% of the annualised 
salary). 25% of any bonus earned for 2018 will be paid in the form of deferred shares. The bonus will be based on achievement 
against a range of financial targets and individual KPIs. The KPIs are linked to the financial, strategic and operational performance 
of the business, and include measures relating to business and sales growth, market share, brand-building and organisational 
targets. The annual bonus will be based 50% on achievement of the EBITDA target, 30% on the cash target and 20% on the 
KPIs. These performance targets are the key drivers to sustain the growth of the Group, and the individual KPIs ensure that the 
Executive Directors are committed to the Group’s strategy. The forward-looking targets are deemed to be commercially sensitive. 
The maximum bonus opportunity will be payable only for achieving stretch levels of performance. Details of the targets and 
performance against them will be published in our 2018 Directors’ Remuneration Report. 
Performance Share Plan (PSP)
As described in the statement by the Committee Chairman on page 67, PSP awards for 2018 will be granted at the level of 
125% of salary to be earned in the nine month financial period, which equates to 93.75% of annualised salary. The vesting of 
the awards will be subject to the satisfaction of performance conditions measured over 2018, 2019 and 2020 based on EPS 
growth (as regards 50% of each award) and cash conversion (as regards 50% of each award), as set out below:

Pro-rata between 25% and 100% Between 6% and 12% Between 75% and 90%
100% 12% or more 90% or more
1.   For these purposes, EPS will be defined as fully diluted earnings per share as disclosed in the note 7 subject to such adjustments as the Committee 
shall determine from time to time 
2.  For these purposes, cash conversion will be calculated as Adjusted free cashflow / Adjusted EBITDA (see note 7)
There will also be an underlying requirement for any vesting to occur which will be that, at the time of vesting, the 
Remuneration Committee must be satisfied with the overall financial performance of the Group. In addition, the cash 
conversion performance measure shall be subject to a further requirement that an award will not vest by reference to that 
performance measure unless a further underpin based on EBITDA performance over the performance period is achieved. 
Fees for the Chairman and NEDs
In 2018 no change is proposed to the level of fees paid to the Chairman and NEDs.

The existence of branches outside the UK 
The Group’s activities in overseas jurisdictions are carried out through subsidiary companies. The Company does not have 
any branches outside the UK. 
Significant agreements 
The Group is a party to the following significant agreements that would take effect, alter or terminate on a change of control 
of the Company following a takeover bid: 
• Amended and restated Facilities agreement dated 21 July 2017 for a €200,000,000 revolving facility agreement with a 
banking club consisting of five banks including HSBC who also act as the Agent. The loans bear variable rates of interest 
which are linked to the inter-bank offer rates of the drawers, WIBOR, PRIBOR or EURIBOR as appropriate. Each of the 
loans have a variable margin element to the interest charge. The margin is linked to a ratchet mechanism where the 
margin decreases as the Group’s leverage covenant decreases.
• Agreement with Quintessential Brands Group in relation to the acquisition in July 2017 of a 25% equity interest in 
Quintessential Brands Ireland Whiskey Limited (QBIWL). The shareholder not subject to the change of control, shall be 
entitled to purchase the other shareholder’s shares in the QBIWL.
Dividend 
A dividend of 2.38 €cents per share was paid at the half year stage (see note 29 to the financial statements), and the 
Directors recommend a final dividend of 5.72€cents to be paid on 25 May 2018 to shareholders on the share register at 
the close of business on 4 May 2018. The shares will be quoted ex-dividend on 3 May 2018. The FX fixing date will be  
4 May 2018.
Total dividends paid and proposed for the year amount to 8.10 €cents per share. 
Going concern 
The Directors have considered the Group’s debt maturity and cash-flow projections, and an analysis of projected-debt 
covenant compliance. The Board is satisfied that the Group’s forecasts and projections, taking into account reasonable 
changes in trading performance, shows that the Group will continue in operation for a period of at least 12 months from the 
date of this report, and has neither the intention nor the need to liquidate or materially curtail the scale of its operations.  
For this reason the Group continues to adopt the going-concern basis in preparing its financial statements. More information 
can be seen in note 2 to the financial statements.

Stock Spirits Group PLC 
Annual Report & Accounts 2017  Statement of Directors’ responsibilities
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report and the Group and parent company financial statements in 
accordance with applicable law and regulations. 
Company law requires the Directors to prepare Group and parent company financial statements for each financial year. 
Under that law, they are required to prepare the Group financial statements in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU 
and applicable law, and have elected to prepare the parent company financial statements on the same basis. 
Under company law, the Directors must not approve the financial statements unless they are satisfied that they give a true 
and fair view of the state of affairs of the Group and parent company, and of their profit or loss for that period. In preparing 
each of the Group and parent company financial statements, the Directors are required to: 
• Select suitable accounting policies, and then apply them consistently;
• Make judgements and estimates that are reasonable, relevant and reliable;
• State whether they have been prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU;
• Assess the Group and parent company's ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to 
going concern; and 
• Use the going concern basis of accounting unless they either intend to liquidate the Group or the parent company or to 
cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain the parent 
company’s transactions, and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the parent company, 
and enable them to ensure its financial statements comply with the Companies Act 2006. They are responsible for 
such internal control as they determine is necessary to enable the preparation of the financial statements that are free 
from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and have general responsibility for taking such steps as are 
reasonably open to them to safeguard the assets of the Group, and to prevent and detect fraud and other irregularities. 
Under applicable law and regulations, the Directors are also responsible for preparing a Strategic Report, Directors’ Report, 
Directors’ Remuneration Report and Corporate Governance Report that complies with that law and those regulations. 
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the corporate and financial information included on the 
company’s website. Legislation in the UK governing the preparation and dissemination of financial statements may differ from 
legislation in other jurisdictions. 
Responsibility statement of the Directors in respect of the Annual Report & Accounts (ARA)
We confirm that, to the best of our knowledge:
• The financial statements, prepared in accordance with the applicable set of accounting standards, give a true and fair 
view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and profit or loss of the Company, and the undertakings included in the 
consolidation taken as a whole; and
• The Strategic Report and Directors’ Report include a fair review of the development and performance of the business and 
the position of the issuer and the undertakings included in the consolidation taken as a whole, together with a description 
of the principal risks and uncertainties that they face.
We consider the ARA, taken as a whole, is fair, balanced and understandable and provides the information necessary for 
shareholders to assess the Group’s position and performance, business model and strategy. 
By order of the Board.

statement of comprehensive income, consolidated 
and ompany statement of financial position, 
consolidated and company statement of changes 
in equity, consolidated and company statement 
of cashflows, and the related notes, including the 
accounting policies in note 3 to the consolidated 
financial statements, and note 2 to the parent 
company financial statements.
In our opinion:

of the state of the Group’s and of the parent 
company’s affairs as at 31 December 2017 and 
of the Group’s profit for the year then ended; 
–  the Group financial statements have been 
properly prepared in accordance with 
International Financial Reporting Standards

been properly prepared in accordance with 
IFRSs as adopted by the EU and as applied

90 2. Key audit matters: our assessment of risks of material misstatement
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in the audit of the 
financial statements and include the most significant assessed risks of material misstatement (whether or not due 
to fraud) identified by us, including those which had the greatest effect on: the overall audit strategy; the allocation 
of resources in the audit; and directing the efforts of the engagement team. We summarise below the key audit 
matters, in decreasing order of audit significance, in arriving at our audit opinion above, together with our key audit 
procedures to address those matters and, as required for public interest entities, our results from those procedures. 
These matters were addressed, and our results are based on procedures undertaken, in the context of, and solely  
for the purpose of, our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon,  
and consequently are incidental to that opinion, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.
The risk Our response
Goodwill & brand 
intangible asset 
impairment
(€302 million; 2016: 
€311 million)
Refer to page 63 
(Audit Committee 
Report), page 115 
(accounting policy) 
and page 135 
(financial 
disclosures).
Forecast-based valuation
The risk is focused on the Czech and 
Italy Cash Generating Units (CGUs) 
for which the level of headroom is 
the most sensitive. An impairment 
was recorded against the carrying 
value of Italy goodwill in the current 
period.
The appropriateness of the carrying 
value of goodwill and brand 
intangible assets is dependent on 
achieving sufficient levels of future 
cashflows. The assets are spread 
across a range of markets and 
consequently forecasting cashflows 
used in impairment testing is more 
complex, requiring assumptions to 
be made relating to differing 
economic environments. Estimating 
the recoverable amount is subjective 
due to the inherent uncertainty 
involved in forecasting and 
discounting future cashflows.
Our procedures included:
– Assessing forecasts: based on our 
knowledge of the business and industry, 
we assessed the forecast revenue growth 
and profit margins with reference to past 
performance, future plans (for example, brand 
positioning, pricing actions and promotional 
expenditure), and external market data for 
each CGU.
– Benchmarking assumptions: we involved 
our own valuation specialists to assess the 
long term growth rates, and discount rates 
used by the Group for each CGU, including 
comparing the key inputs, such as risk free 
rates, size premium, country premium and 
inflation, to externally derived data. 
– Sensitivity analysis: we performed 
breakeven analysis on key assumptions, 
including discount rate and projected  
cashflows. 
– Assessing transparency: we considered 
whether the Group’s disclosures about the 
sensitivity of the outcome of the impairment 
assessment to changes in key assumptions 
reflected the risks inherent in the valuation of 
goodwill and brand intangible assets.
Our results 
– We found the resulting estimate of the 
recoverable amount of goodwill and brand 
intangible assets to be acceptable. (2016 
result: Acceptable).

Calculation error 
The Group negotiates a variety of 
sales incentive arrangements, 
particularly retrospective volume 
rebates and other contractual 
discounts, with most of  
its customers. 
The reductions resulting from these 
arrangements are significant in the 
income statement, in particular from 
the Polish operations. There are a 
large number of individual customer 
arrangements for the Group to 
monitor that are in place across 
multiple locations and include 
differing terms. As such there is a 
risk of incorrect calculation of the 
sales incentives due to key terms 
having been input inappropriately.
Not all sales incentives are confirmed 
by customers at 31 December, albeit 
rebate measurement periods are 
retrospective and in most cases 
coterminous with the 31 December 
year end.
Omitted arrangements
Due to the large number of 
customers and the geographic spread 
there is a risk that not all sales 
incentive arrangements have been 
captured and reflected in the financial 
statements, either through fraud or 
error. 
2017/2018 sales
The business is seasonal in nature 
with peak revenues towards the end 
of the financial year which increases 
the risk of inclusion of revenue in the 
wrong period. Trading conditions in 
2017 continued to be challenging 
across the Group and there is 
pressure to achieve financial targets. 
These considerations give rise to  
an increased risk of management  
bias or fraud over the timing of 
revenue recognition.
Our procedures included:
– Expectation vs outcome: we performed a 
comparison of amounts deducted from sales as 
a proportion of gross sales throughout the year 
and across regions and customers to identify 
any unusual trends. We assessed whether 
these indicated further risk of revenue being 
inappropriately recognised in the current year. 
– Enquiry of customers: we have sought 
customer confirmations of amounts owed with 
a sample of customers and investigated any 
significant differences between confirmations 
received and the Group’s records. Where 
responses were not received, alternative 
procedures were performed, including agreeing 
the records to post year end cash receipts.
– Reperformance: in addition to quantitatively 
significant contracts, we selected a random 
additional sample of other customer contracts, 
understood the key terms and recalculated 
rebates based on those terms.
– Historical comparison: we assessed the 
completeness of prior period accruals for sales 
incentives by performing an analysis of 
payments made, invoices received and credit 
notes issued in 2016 against accrued amounts.
– Test of details: we have assessed the 
completeness of accruals for sales incentives 
by agreeing a sample of post year end cash 
disbursements, invoices received and credit 
notes issued to amounts recorded by the 
Group at the year end to obtain evidence that 
sales incentives were recorded in the income 
statement in the correct period.
– Extended scope: we tested a sample of 
invoices issued close to the year end to assess 
whether revenue was recorded in the 
appropriate period by agreeing the sale 
recorded to delivery note information. We also 
inspected a sample of journal entries relating 
to revenue, including transactions close to the 
year end, and assessed whether they were 
booked into the correct period by agreeing to 
supporting documentation, including delivery 
notes where applicable.
Our results 
– We found the Group’s assessment of 
revenue recognition to be acceptable  
(2016 result: Acceptable).

Dispute outcome
The directors are required to 
make judgements and estimates 
in determining the liabilities to 
be recognised with regard to the 
various taxation exposures. 
The Group has a number of 
outstanding tax assessments. 
The tax risks for the group include 
transfer pricing amounts charged not 
being considered deductible by local 
authorities for corporation tax. 
Our procedures included:
– Own tax expertise: we used our own local 
tax specialists to assess the Group’s tax 
positions, through inquiry of management 
and their external tax advisors with regard to 
latest status with the relevant tax authorities. 
We obtained management’s written 
correspondence with the Group’s tax advisors 
containing their explanations of material tax 
exposures and any related litigation. We 
analysed and challenged the assumptions 
used to determine tax provisions based on our 
knowledge and experiences of the application 
of the international and local legislation by the 
relevant authorities and courts.
– Our sector experience: we assessed the 
Group’s transfer pricing documentation and 
policy with reference to the latest market 
practices in this area.
– Assessing transparency: we assessed the 
appropriateness of the disclosures in the 
financial statements in respect of tax and 
uncertain tax positions. 
Our results 
– We found the level of tax provisioning to be 
acceptable (2016 result: Acceptable).

Refer to page 63 
(Audit Committee 
Report), page

Low risk, high value
The carrying amount of the parent 
company’s investment in its 
subsidiary represents 94% (2016: 
89%) of the company’s total assets. 
The recoverability is not at a high 
risk of significant misstatement or 
subject to significant judgement. 
However, due to their materiality in 
the context of the parent company 
financial statements, this is 
considered to be the area that had 
the greatest effect on our overall 
parent company audit.
Our procedures included: 
– Tests of detail: comparing the carrying 
amount of 100% of investments with the 
relevant subsidiaries’ financial statements to 
identify whether their net assets, being an 
approximation of their minimum recoverable 
amount, were in excess of their carrying amount 
and assessing whether those subsidiaries have 
historically been profit-making.
– Assessing subsidiary audits: assessing 
the work performed by the subsidiary 
audit team on all of those subsidiaries and 
considering the results of that work, on those 
subsidiaries’ profits and net assets. 
– Our sector experience: where the carrying 
amount exceeded the net asset value, 
comparing the carrying amount of the 
investment with the expected value of the 
business based on relevant market data.
Our results
– We found the Group’s assessment of the 
recoverability of the investment in subsidiaries 
to be acceptable. (2016 result: Acceptable).

3.  Our application of materiality and an overview 
of the scope of our audit 
Materiality for the Group financial statements as a 
whole was set at €1.6 million (2016: €1.5 million), 
determined with reference to a benchmark of group 
profit before tax, normalised to exclude this year’s 
impairment loss as disclosed in note 17, of which it 
represents 3.8% (2016: 3.8%). 
Materiality for the parent company financial 
statements as a whole was set at £0.3 million (2016: 
£0.3 million) by reference to component materiality. 
This is lower than the materiality we would 
otherwise have determined by reference to assets, 
and represents 0.1% of the Company's total assets 
(2016: 0.1%).
We agreed to report to the Audit Committee any 
corrected or uncorrected identified misstatements 
exceeding €80,000, in addition to other identified 
misstatements that warranted reporting on 
qualitative grounds.
Of the Group’s 16 (2016: 16) reporting components, 
we subjected 7 (2016: 7) to full scope audits for 
group purposes. 
The components within the scope of our work 
accounted for the percentages illustrated opposite. 
The remaining 3% (2016: 3%) of total Group 
revenue, 2% (2016: 1%) of group profit before 
tax and 2% (2016: 2%) of total Group assets is 
represented by 9 (2016: 9) reporting components, 
none of which individually represented more than 
1% (2016: 1%) of any of total Group revenue, 
Group profit before tax or total Group assets. For 
these residual components, we performed analysis 
at an aggregated Group level to re-examine our 
assessment that there were no significant risks of 
material misstatement within these. 
The Group team instructed component auditors as 
to the significant areas to be covered, including the 
relevant risks detailed above and the information 
to be reported back. The Group team approved the 
component materialities, which ranged from €0.3 
million to €1.1 million, having regard to the mix of size 
and risk profile of the Group across the components. 
The work on 5 of the 7 components (2016: 5 of the 7 
components) was performed by component auditors 
and the rest, including the audit of the parent 
company, were performed by the Group team. 
The Group audit team visited 4 (2016: 4) component 
locations in Poland (1), Czech Republic (2) and Italy 
(1), to assess the audit risk and strategy and review 
work performed. Telephone and video conference 
meetings were also held with these component 
auditors and others that were not physically visited. 
At these visits and meetings, the findings reported to 
the Group audit team were discussed in more detail, 
and any further work required by the Group team was 
then performed by the component auditor.

We are required to report to you if:
– we have anything material to add or draw 
attention to in relation to the Directors’ statement 
in note 2 to the financial statements on the use 
of the going concern basis of accounting with no 
material uncertainties that may cast significant 
doubt over the Group and Company’s use of that 
basis for a period of at least twelve months from 
the date of approval of the financial statements; or 
– the related statement under the Listing Rules set 
out on page 88 is materially inconsistent with our 
audit knowledge. 
We have nothing to report in these respects. 
5. We have nothing to report on the other 
information in the Annual Report 
The directors are responsible for the other 
information presented in the Annual Report together 
with the financial statements. Our opinion on the 
financial statements does not cover the other 
information and, accordingly, we do not express an 
audit opinion or, except as explicitly stated below, 
any form of assurance conclusion thereon. 
Our responsibility is to read the other information 
and, in doing so, consider whether, based on our 
financial statements audit work, the information 
therein is materially misstated or inconsistent with 
the financial statements or our audit knowledge. 
Based solely on that work we have not identified 
material misstatements in the other information.
 Strategic report and Directors’ report 
Based solely on our work on the other information: 
– we have not identified material misstatements in 
the Strategic Report and the Directors’ Report; 
– in our opinion the information given in those 
reports for the financial year is consistent with 
the financial statements; and 
– in our opinion those reports have been prepared 
in accordance with the Companies Act 2006.
 Directors’ remuneration report 
In our opinion the part of the Directors’ 
Remuneration Report to be audited has been 
properly prepared in accordance with the 
Companies Act 2006. 
 Disclosures of principal risks and  
 longer-term viability 
Based on the knowledge we acquired during our 
financial statements audit, we have nothing material 
to add or draw attention to in relation to:
– the Directors’ confirmation within the viability 
statement on page 20 that they have carried out 
a robust assessment of the principal risks facing 
the Group, including those that would threaten its 
business model, future performance, solvency 
and liquidity;
– the Principal Risks and Uncertainties disclosures 
describing these risks and explaining how they are 
being managed and mitigated; and
– the Directors’ explanation in the viability statement 
of how they have assessed the prospects of the 
Group, over what period they have done so and 
why they considered that period to be appropriate, 
and their statement as to whether they have a 
reasonable expectation that the Group will be able 
to continue in operation and meet its liabilities as 
they fall due over the period of their assessment, 
including any related disclosures drawing attention 
to any necessary qualifications or assumptions. 
Under the Listing Rules we are required to review 
the viability statement. We have nothing to report in 
this respect.
 Corporate governance disclosures 
We are required to report to you if: 
– we have identified material inconsistencies 
between the knowledge we acquired during 
our financial statements audit and the Directors’ 
statement that they consider that the annual 
report and financial statements taken as a whole 
is fair, balanced and understandable and provides 
the information necessary for shareholders to 
assess the Group’s position and performance, 
business model and strategy; or 
– the section of the annual report describing 
the work of the Audit Committee does not 
appropriately address matters communicated by 
us to the Audit Committee.
We are required to report to you if the Corporate 
Governance Statement does not properly disclose 
a departure from the eleven provisions of the UK 
Corporate Governance Code specified by the Listing 
Rules for our review. 
We have nothing to report in these respects. 
Strategic Review Governance Financial Statements
95 Independent Auditor’s Report continued
6. We have nothing to report on the other 
matters on which we are required to report  
by exception
Under the Companies Act 2006, we are required to 
report to you if, in our opinion: 
– adequate accounting records have not been kept 
by the parent Company, or returns adequate for 
our audit have not been received from branches 
not visited by us; or 
– the parent Company financial statements and the 
part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be 
audited are not in agreement with the accounting 
records and returns; or 
– certain disclosures of Directors’ remuneration 
specified by law are not made; or 
– we have not received all the information and 
explanations we require for our audit.
We have nothing to report in these respects.
7. Respective responsibilities 
 Directors’ responsibilities
As explained more fully in their statement set out 
on page 89, the Directors are responsible for: the 
preparation of the financial statements including 
being satisfied that they give a true and fair view; 
such internal control as they determine is necessary 
to enable the preparation of financial statements that 
are free from material misstatement, whether due 
to fraud or error; assessing the Group and parent 
Company’s ability to continue as a going concern, 
disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going 
concern; and using the going concern basis of 
accounting unless they either intend to liquidate the 
Group or the parent Company or to cease operations, 
or have no realistic alternative but to do so.
 Auditor’s responsibilities 
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance 
about whether the financial statements as a whole 
are free from material misstatement, whether 
due to fraud or other irregularities (see below), 
or error, and to issue our opinion in an auditor’s 
report. Reasonable assurance is a high level of 
assurance, but does not guarantee that an audit 
conducted in accordance with ISAs (UK) will 
always detect a material misstatement when it 
exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud, other 
irregularities or error and are considered material if, 
individually or in aggregate, they could reasonably 
be expected to influence the economic decisions of 
users taken on the basis of the financial statements. 
A fuller description of our responsibilities is  
provided on the FRC’s website at  
www.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities. 
 Irregularities – ability to detect
We identified areas of laws and regulations that 
could reasonably be expected to have a material 
effect on the financial statements from our sector 
experience, through discussion with the Directors 
and other management (as required by auditing 
standards), and from inspection of certain of the 
Group’s regulatory and legal correspondence.
We had regard to laws and regulations in areas that 
directly affect the financial statements including 
financial reporting (including related company 
legislation) and taxation legislation. We considered 
the extent of compliance with those laws and 
regulations as part of our procedures on the related 
financial statements items. 
In addition we considered the impact of laws 
and regulations in the specific areas of corporate 
taxation and excise duty recognising the financial 
nature of the Group’s activities and its legal form. 
With the exception of any known or possible 
non-compliance, and as required by auditing 
standards, our work in respect of these was 
limited to enquiry of the Directors and other 
management and inspection of regulatory and legal 
correspondence. We considered the effect of any 
known or possible non-compliance in these areas 
as part of our procedures on the related financial 
statements items. Further detail in respect of 
corporate taxation is set out in the key audit matter 
disclosures in section 2 of this report.
96 We communicated identified laws and regulations 
throughout our team and remained alert to any 
indications of non-compliance throughout the 
audit. This included requesting our component 
audit teams to report on any indications of potential 
existence of non-compliance with relevant laws 
and regulations (irregularities) in areas directly 
identified by the component team.
As with any audit, there remained a higher risk 
of non-detection of irregularities, as these may 
involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, 
misrepresentations, or the override of internal 
controls. 
8. The purpose of our audit work and to whom 
we owe our responsibilities 
This report is made solely to the Company’s 
members, as a body, in accordance with Chapter 
3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006. Our audit 
work has been undertaken so that we might state 
to the Company’s members those matters we are 
required to state to them in an auditor’s report and 
for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted 
by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility 
to anyone other than the Company and the 
Company’s members, as a body, for our audit work, 
for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.

Governance Financial Statements Notes to the consolidated financial statements
at 31 December 2017
1. Corporate information
These consolidated financial statements were approved and authorised for issue by the Board of Directors of Stock Spirits 
Group PLC (the Company) on 7 March 2018.
Stock Spirits Group PLC is domiciled in England. The Company’s registered office is at Solar House, Mercury Park, Wooburn 
Green, Buckinghamshire, HP10 0HH, United Kingdom.
The Company, together with its subsidiaries (the Group), is involved in the production and distribution of branded spirits  
in Central and Eastern Europe.
2. Going concern
The Directors have, at the time of approving the financial statements, a reasonable expectation that the Company and 
the Group have adequate resources to continue in operational existence for a period of at least 12 months from the date 
of approval of the financial statements. Thus they continue to adopt a going concern basis of accounting in preparing the 
financial statements.
The financial position of the Group, its cashflows, liquidity position and borrowings facilities are described in the paragraphs 
below. In addition note 30 to the financial statements includes the Group’s objectives, policies and processes for managing 
its capital, its financial risk management objectives, details of its financial instruments and hedging activities, and its exposure 
to credit risk and liquidity.
Details of the terms of each external loan facility are set out in note 23. The Group met its covenant requirements 
throughout the year ended 31 December 2017. 
The Group has positive free cashflow. The Group has a €200,000,000 revolving credit facility available to it. As at 31 
December 2017 €114,191,000 (2016: €134,319,000) was drawn, and a further €14,250,000 (2016: €14,751,000) was 
utilised for customs guarantees in Italy and Germany, thereby leaving access to funds of €71,599,000 (2016: €50,930,000) 
which could be drawn at short notice. See note 23 for further details.
The Group’s forecasts and projections, taking account of possible changes in trading performance, show that the Group  
will be able to operate within the level of its current available facilities and maintain comfortable covenant headroom.  
The revolving credit facility is available as part of wider borrowing arrangements with the syndicate of banks and is not 
subject to annual renewal. Stock Polska Sp. z.o.o. also has a debt factoring facility of €33,573,000 (PLN 140,000,000) 
which can be utilised to meet short term working capital requirements if necessary. Pursuant to the HSBC Credit Facility, 
the total amount of receivables subject to a factoring facility may not in aggregate exceed €50,000,000. See note 20 for 
further details.
After making enquiries, the Directors have reasonable expectation that the Company and the Group will have adequate 
resources to continue their operational existence for the foreseeable future and remain compliant with the covenant 
requirements under the Group’s revolving credit facility for a period of at least 12 months from the date of approval of the 
financial statements. Accordingly, they continue to adopt the going concern basis for preparing the financial statements.

Stock Spirits Group PLC 
Annual Report & Accounts 2017  3. Accounting policies
Basis of preparation
These consolidated financial statements of the Group have been prepared in accordance with International Financial 
Reporting Standards (IFRS), as adopted by the European Union. International Financial Reporting Standards are issued by 
the International Accounting Standard Board (IASB). 
These consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis as the Directors believe there are no 
material uncertainties that lead to significant doubt that the entity can continue as a going concern for a period of at least 
12 months from the date of approval of the financial statements.
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention, except as disclosed in the 
accounting policies below. 
Changes in accounting policies
In the preparation of these consolidated financial statements, the Group followed the same accounting policies and  
methods of computation as compared with those applied in the previous year, except for the adoption of new standards  
and interpretations and revision of the existing standards as of 1 January 2017.
New/Revised standards and interpretations adopted in 2017
The following amendments to existing standards and interpretations were effective for the year and were applicable  
to the Group:
Amendments to IAS 7: Disclosure initiative
This amendment aims to assist users of financial statements to evaluate changes in an entity’s liabilities arising from financing 
activities. This includes changes from cashflows and non-cash items, such as the impact of fluctuations in foreign exchange 
rates, changes in fair value, gain or loss of control of subsidiaries and other businesses. Furthermore, the new disclosure 
requirements apply to changes in financial assets, such as assets used to hedge liabilities arising from financial activities,  
if the corresponding cashflows would be classified as cashflows from financing activities. 
The disclosure requirements are met by a reconciliation between the opening and closing balances (per the statement of 
financial statement) of the financing liabilities in note 23. 
The following amendments to existing standards and interpretations were effective for the year, but either they were not 
applicable to or did not have a material impact on the Group:
• Amendments to IAS 12: IAS 12 Recognition of Deferred Tax Assets for Unrealised Losses
• Annual Improvements to IFRS Standards 2014–2016 Cycle – Minor amendments to IFRS 12

1.  The effective dates stated above are those given in the original IASB/IFRIC standards and interpretations. As the Group prepares 
its financial statements in accordance with IFRS as adopted by the European Union (EU), the application of new standards and 
interpretations will be subject to their having been endorsed for use in the EU via the EU Endorsement mechanism. In the majority  
of cases this will result in an effective date consistent with that given in the original standard or interpretation but the need for 
endorsement restricts the Group’s discretion to early adopt standards.
The Directors do not expect the adoption of these standards and interpretations to have a material impact on the 
consolidated or company financial statements in the period of initial application. 
A detailed review of the impact of IFRS 15 and IFRS 9 has been undertaken. The impacts are as follows:
IFRS 15 Revenue from customers
IFRS 15 “Revenue from customers” provides a single, principle-based, five-step model to be applied to all sales contracts, 
based on the transfer of control of goods and services to customers.
The Group has carried out analysis of how IFRS 15 should be implemented within our markets and we expect that the impact will 
be primarily on the recording of the payments we make to customers to support promotions and marketing activities. With the 
exception of slotting and listing fees, these are currently recorded as sales expenses. From 1 January 2018, with the adoption of 
IFRS 15, these costs will be a reduction to revenue.
The impact on revenue, if applied in 2017 is very minor for the Group at about 2%. There is no impact on Adjusted EBITDA 
and the change in Adjusted EBITDA margin is a very minor improvement of approximately 0.36%, as can be shown in the 
analysis for 2017 as per the following table: 
Revenue 
€000s
Adjusted EBITDA 
€000s
Adjusted EBITDA 
as % of revenue
Current reporting 274,601 56,324 20.51%
Under IFRS 15 269,837 56,324 20.87%
% change (1.7%) – 0.36%
This quantum is based upon the specific composition and nature of the Group’s portfolio of contracts and economic 
conditions at the date of transition. 
In the transition period, when IFRS 15 is adopted, it is the intention that the changes will be adopted from start of the reporting 
period on a modified retrospective basis. This does not modify the prior period’s reporting but restates the opening retained 
earnings for the cumulative effect of initially applying this standard if the changes impact the profits of the Group. For the Group 
there is no expected impact on the opening retained earnings for 2018.

Stock Spirits Group PLC 
Annual Report & Accounts 2017  IFRS 9 Financial Instruments
IFRS 9 “Financial Instruments” will simplify the classification of financial assets for measurement purposes, but is not 
anticipated to have a significant impact on the financial statement, including in respect of the non-substantial modification  
of the Group’s financing arrangements in 2017.
IFRS 16 Leases
A project to implement IFRS 16 “Leases” will be undertaken in early 2018. The Directors do expect that the adoption of this 
standard will have a material impact to the Group’s financial statements in the period of initial application. The Group does 
not intend to apply the new standard before 1 January 2019.
IFRS 16 will remove the distinction between operating leases and finance leases and will require lessees to report operating 
leases on the balance sheet, similar to the treatment of finance leases under IAS 17. Lessees will recognise an asset for the 
right to use the leased asset and a liability for the future lease payments for each lease. They will also have to recognise an 
element of each lease payment as an interest charge.
The effect of this on the Group’s financial statements will be that gross assets and gross liabilities will each increase following 
the recognition of right-of-use assets and lease liabilities relating to future lease payments. In the income statement 
depreciation or amortisation and interest expenses will be recognised, instead of lease rental expenses. This change will 
result in an improvement in the financial measure of Adjusted EBITDA. In the Statement of cashflows, the change in 
presentation of the lease expenses will result in an improvement in the cashflows from operating activities and a decrease in 
the cashflows from financing activities.
Basis of consolidation 
The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the Company and its subsidiaries controlled by 
the Company for the years to 31 December 2017 and 31 December 2016. Control is achieved when the Group is exposed, 
or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the investee and has the ability to affect those returns through its 
power over the investee. Specifically, the Group controls an investee if, and only if, the Group has: 
• Power over the investee (i.e., existing rights that give it the current ability to direct the relevant activities of the investee) 
• Exposure, or rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the investee
• The ability to use its power over the investee to affect its returns. 
Generally, there is a presumption that a majority of voting rights result in control. To support this presumption and when 
the Group has less than a majority of the voting or similar rights of an investee, the Group considers all relevant facts and 
circumstances in assessing whether it has power over an investee, including: 
• The contractual arrangement with the other vote holders of the investee 
• Rights arising from other contractual arrangements
• The Group’s voting rights and potential voting rights.
The Group re-assesses whether or not it controls an investee if facts and circumstances indicate that there are changes to 
one or more of the three elements of control. Consolidation of a subsidiary begins when the Group obtains control over the 
subsidiary and ceases when the Group loses control of the subsidiary. Assets, liabilities, income and expenses of a subsidiary 
acquired or disposed of during the year are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date the Group gains 
control until the date the Group ceases to control the subsidiary.

3. Accounting policies continued
Subsidiaries
Subsidiaries are entities controlled by the Group. The Group controls an entity when it is exposed to, or has rights to, variable 
returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity. 
The financial statements of subsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date on which control 
commences until the date on which control ceases.
The subsidiary financial statements are prepared for the same reporting year as the parent company and are based on consistent 
accounting policies. All intragroup balances and transactions including unrealised profit arising from them are eliminated in full.
A change in the ownership interest of a subsidiary, without loss of control, is accounted for as an equity transaction.  
If the Group loses control of a subsidiary it (i) derecognises the assets (including goodwill) and liabilities of the subsidiary;  
(ii) derecognises the carrying amount of any non-controlling interest; (iii) derecognises the cumulative translation differences 
recorded in equity; (iv) recognises the fair value of the consideration received; (v) recognises the fair value of any investment 
retained; (vi) recognises any surplus or deficit in profit or loss; (vii) recognises the parent’s share of any components 
previously recognised in other comprehensive income to profit or loss or retained earnings, as appropriate.
Business combinations
Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method. The cost of any acquisition is measured as the 
aggregate of the consideration transferred, measured at acquisition date fair value and the amount of any non-controlling 
interest in the acquiree. For each business combination the acquirer measures the non-controlling interest in the acquiree 
either at fair value or at the proportionate share of the acquirer’s identifiable net assets. Acquisition costs incurred are 
expensed and included within exceptional items.
When the Group acquires a business it assesses the financial assets and liabilities assumed for appropriate classification and 
designation in accordance with the contractual terms, economic circumstances and pertinent conditions as at the acquisition 
date. This includes the separation of embedded derivatives in host contracts by the acquiree.
Goodwill is initially recognised at cost being the excess of the aggregate of the consideration transferred and the amount 
recognised for non-controlling interest over the net identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed. If this consideration  
is lower than the fair value of the net assets of the subsidiary acquired, the difference is recognised in profit and loss.
After initial recognition goodwill is measured at cost less any accumulated impairment losses. For the purpose of impairment 
testing goodwill acquired in a business combination is from the acquisition date allocated to each of the Group’s cash 
generating units that are expected to benefit from the combination irrespective of whether assets or liabilities of the 
acquisition are assigned to those units.
Where goodwill forms part of a cash generating unit and part of the operation within that unit is disposed of, the goodwill 
associated with the operation disposed of is included in the carrying amount of the operation when determining the gain or 
loss on disposal of the operation. Goodwill disposed of in this circumstance is measured based on the relative values of the 
operation disposed of and the portion of the cash generating unit retained.
Associates
Where the Group has the power to participate in (but not control) the financial and operating policy decisions of another entity, 
it is classified as an associate. Associates are initially recognised in the consolidated statement of financial position at cost. 
Subsequently associates are accounted for using the equity method, where the Group’s share of post-acquisition profits and losses 
and other comprehensive income is recognised in the consolidated statement of profit and loss and other comprehensive income 
(except for losses in excess of the Group’s investment in the associate unless there is an obligation to make good those losses). 
110
Stock Spirits Group PLC 
Annual Report & Accounts 2017  Profits and losses arising on transactions between the Group and its associates are recognised only to the extent of 
unrelated investors’ interests in the associate. The investor’s share in the associate’s profits and losses resulting from these 
transactions is eliminated against the carrying value of the associate. 
Any premium paid for an associate above the fair value of the Group’s share of the identifiable assets, liabilities and 
contingent liabilities acquired is capitalised and included in the carrying amount of the associate. Where there is objective 
evidence that the investment in an associate has been impaired the carrying amount of the investment is tested for 
impairment in the same way as other non-financial assets. 
We have allocated the investor’s share of the comprehensive income of equity-accounted investees to the appropriate 
components of equity.
Contingent consideration 
Deferred consideration that is contingent on future performance conditions is recognised at its fair value at acquisition date 
within the cost of investment, with a corresponding entry to other financial liabilities. Changes to fair value of the resulting 
financial liability at each subsequent reporting date are recognised in the income statement.
Revenue recognition
Sale of goods
The Group has concluded that it is the principal in its revenue arrangements, including distribution agreements, as it is  
the primary obligor in these revenue arrangements, has pricing latitude and is also exposed to inventory and credit risks.
As such, revenue from the sale of goods is recognised when all the following conditions are satisfied:
• The Group has transferred to the buyer the significant risks and rewards of ownership of the goods; in general this is 
deemed to occur when customers take delivery of the goods
• The Group retains neither continuing managerial involvement to the degree usually associated with ownership nor 
effective control over the goods sold
• The amount of revenue can be measured reliably
• It is probable that the economic benefits associated with the transaction will flow to the entity; and
• The costs incurred or to be incurred in respect of the transaction can be measured reliably.
Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable, taking into account contractually defined 
terms of payment and excluding taxes or duty which are generally recognised at the point of sale.
Revenue is reduced for estimated customer returns, discounts, rebates and other similar allowances, the measurement of 
which is determined by contractual arrangements with customers. Sales incentives are recognised in the same period as the 
related revenue is recorded, and comprise:
• Discounts and rebates – which are sales incentives to customers to encourage them to purchase increased volumes and 
are related to total volumes, purchases and sales growth Other incentives, such as slotting and listing fees.
The Group has concluded that it is the principal in its revenue arrangements as it is the primary obligor in these revenue 
arrangements, has pricing latitude and is also exposed to inventory and credit risks.

Governance Financial Statements 3. Accounting policies continued
Finance income
Finance income is recognised as interest accrues using the effective interest method. The effective rate is the rate  
that exactly discounts estimated future cash receipts through the expected life of the financial instrument to its net  
carrying amount.
Finance income also includes foreign currency exchange gains on the retranslation of loans and gains arising from changes  
in the fair value of interest rate swap instruments.
Segmental analysis
The accounting policy for identifying segments is based on internal management reporting information that is regularly 
reviewed by the chief operating decision-maker. 
For management purposes, the Group is organised into business units based on geographical area, and has five  
reportable segments:
• Poland
• Czech Republic
• Italy
• Other operational, including the Slovakian, International and Baltic Distillery entities
• Corporate, including the expenses and central costs incurred by non-trading Group entities.
Management monitors the results of all operating segments separately as each of the geographic areas require different 
marketing approaches. Segment performance is evaluated based on EBITDA, adjusted for exceptional items and non-
recurring expenses. 
Foreign currencies
The individual financial statements of each Group entity are presented in the currency of the primary economic  
environment in which the entity operates (its functional currency). For the purpose of the Group financial statements,  
the results and financial position of each entity are reported in euros (€), which is the presentational currency for the Group 
financial statements.
In preparing the financial statements of the individual entities, transactions in currencies other than the entity’s functional 
currency (foreign currencies) are recorded at the rates of exchange prevailing at the dates of the transactions. At each end  
of the reporting period, monetary items denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rates prevailing at the end of 
the reporting period. 
Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rates as 
at the dates of the initial transactions. Non-monetary items measured at fair value in a foreign currency are translated using the 
exchange rates at the date when the fair value was determined. All resulting differences are taken to the income statement.
For the purpose of presenting Group financial statements, the assets and liabilities of the Group’s foreign operations 
are expressed in euros using exchange rates prevailing at the end of the reporting period. Income and expense items 
are translated at the average exchange rates for the period. Exchange differences arising, if any, are classified as other 
comprehensive income and transferred to the Group’s translation reserve. 
Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a foreign operation are treated as assets and liabilities  
of the foreign operation and translated at the closing rate.

Employee benefits – severance indemnity
The provision for employee severance indemnity, mandatory for Italian companies pursuant to Law No. 297/1982, represents 
an unfunded defined benefit plan, according to IAS 19 (Revised), and is based on the working life of employees and on the 
remuneration earned by an employee over the course of a pre-determined term of service. 
For details of the actuarial assumptions used, see note 25. For the severance indemnity, the cost of providing benefits is 
determined using the Projected Unit Credit Method, with actuarial valuations being carried out at each reporting period.  
Past service costs are expensed in full in the year in which the past service credit is granted.
The severance indemnity obligation recognised in the statement of financial position represents the present value of the 
obligation as adjusted for unrecognised actuarial gains and losses and unrecognised past service cost, and as reduced by the 
fair value of plan assets. Any asset resulting from this calculation is limited to unrecognised actuarial losses and past service 
cost, plus the present value of available refunds and reductions in future contributions to the plan.
Contributions for severance indemnity are recognised as an expense in the income statement when employees have 
rendered service entitling them to the contributions.
Income taxes
Current income tax assets and liabilities are measured at the amount expected to be recovered from or paid to the taxation 
authorities. The tax rates and tax laws used to compute the amount are those that are enacted or substantively enacted by 
the balance sheet date.
Deferred income tax is recognised on all temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and 
their carrying amounts in the financial statements with the following exceptions: 
• Where the temporary differences arises from the initial recognition of goodwill or of an asset or liability in a transaction 
that is not a business combination and, at the time of the transaction, affects neither the accounting profit nor taxable 
profit or loss
•  In respect of taxable temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, associates and interests in joint 
ventures, where the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences can be controlled and it is probable that the 
temporary differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Strategic Review 
113
Governance Financial Statements 3. Accounting policies continued
Income taxes continued
Deferred income tax assets are recognised only to the extent that the directors consider that it is probable that there will  
be taxable profits from which the deductible temporary differences, carried forward tax credits or tax losses can be utilised.
Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured on an undiscounted basis at the tax rate that is expected to apply 
when the related asset is realised or liability is settled, based on tax rates enacted or substantively enacted by the balance 
sheet date.
The carrying amount of deferred income tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date. Deferred income tax assets  
and liabilities are offset, only if a legally enforcement right exists to set off current tax assets against current tax liabilities,  
the deferred income taxes relate to the same taxation authority and that authority permits the Group to make a single  
net payment. 
Income tax is charged or credited to other comprehensive income if it relates to items that are charged or credited to other 
comprehensive income. Similarly, income tax is charged or credited directly to equity if it relates to items that are credited or 
charged directly to equity. Otherwise income tax is recognised in the income statement.
Property, plant and equipment
Buildings held for use in the production or supply of goods or services, or for administrative purposes, are stated in the 
statement of financial position at their cost less depreciation. Land is not depreciated.
Properties in the course of construction for production, rental or administrative purposes, or for purposes not yet 
determined, are carried at cost, less any recognised impairment loss. Depreciation of these assets, on the same basis as other 
property assets, commences when the assets are ready for their intended use. Fixtures and equipment are stated at cost less 
accumulated depreciation and any accumulated impairment losses.
Depreciation is charged so as to write off the cost or valuation of assets, other than land and properties under construction, 
over their estimated useful lives, using the straight-line method. The estimated useful lives, residual values and depreciation 
method are reviewed at each year end, with the effect of any changes in estimate accounted for on a prospective basis.
Assets held under finance leases are depreciated over their expected useful lives on the same basis as owned assets or, 
where shorter, the term of the relevant lease.
The gain or loss arising on the disposal or retirement of an item of property, plant and equipment is determined as the 
difference between the sales proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset and is recognised in the income statement.
The following useful lives are used in the calculation of depreciation:
Land No depreciation
Buildings 20–50 years
Technical equipment 7–20 years
Other equipment 3–10 years

Stock Spirits Group PLC 
Annual Report & Accounts 2017  Intangible assets
Intangible assets acquired separately
Intangible assets including brands, customer lists and trademarks acquired separately are reported at cost less accumulated 
amortisation and accumulated impairment losses. Intangible assets with a definite life are amortised on a straight-line 
basis over their estimated useful lives of between 2 and 15 years. A useful life of 15 years has been applied to trademarks, 
with consideration to the age, history and profile of such trademarks. The estimated useful life and amortisation method 
are reviewed at the end of each reporting period, with the effect of any changes in estimate being accounted for on a 
prospective basis. Amortisation expense related to software is included within other operating expenses in the consolidated 
income statement. Amortisation expense related to customer relationships and trademarks is included in selling expenses.
Intangible assets acquired in a business combination
Intangible assets acquired in a business combination are identified and recognised separately from goodwill where they 
satisfy the definition of an intangible asset and their fair values can be measured reliably. The cost of such intangible assets 
is their fair value at the acquisition date. Fair value of identifiable brands acquired and recognised as part of a business 
combination are determined using the royalty or multi-period excess methods. All of the Group’s brands have indefinite 
useful lives, are not amortised but are subject to an annual impairment test or whenever there is an indication that the asset 
may be impaired.
In arriving at the conclusion that a brand has an indefinite life, management considers their future usage, commercial position, 
stability of industry and all other aspects that might have an impact on this accounting policy. Management considers the 
business to be a brand business and expects to acquire, hold and support brands for an indefinite period. Subsidiary company 
history goes back to 1884 in Italy, 1920 in the Czech Republic and for over 100 years in Poland. Brands have a long tradition 
and companies have built customer loyalty over their history. 
A core element of the Group’s strategy is to invest in building its brands through an ongoing programme of spending on 
consumer marketing and through significant investment in promotional support. This policy is appropriate due to the stable 
long-term nature of the business and the enduring nature of the brands. 
Subsequent to initial recognition, other intangible assets acquired in a business combination are reported at cost less 
accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses, on the same basis as intangible assets acquired separately.
Impairment of tangible and intangible assets excluding goodwill
At each reporting period, the Group reviews the carrying amounts of its tangible and intangible assets to determine whether 
there is any indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss. If any such indication exists, the recoverable 
amount of the asset is estimated in order to determine the extent of the impairment loss (if any). Where it is not possible to 
estimate the recoverable amount of an individual asset, the Group estimates the recoverable amount of the cash-generating 
unit to which the asset belongs. Where a reasonable and consistent basis of allocation can be identified, corporate assets are 
also allocated to individual cash-generating units, or otherwise they are allocated to the smallest group of cash-generating 
units for which a reasonable and consistent allocation basis can be identified.
Intangible assets with indefinite useful lives and intangible assets not yet available for use are tested for impairment annually, 
and whenever there is an indication that the asset may be impaired.
Recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use. In assessing value in use, the estimated 
future cashflows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market 
assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset for which the estimates of future cashflows 
have not been adjusted.

Intangible assets continued
Impairment of tangible and intangible assets excluding goodwill continued
If the recoverable amount of an asset (or cash-generating unit) is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the 
carrying amount of the asset (cash-generating unit) is reduced to its recoverable amount. An impairment loss is recognised 
immediately in the income statement.
Goodwill
Following initial recognition, goodwill is measured at cost less any accumulated impairment losses. For the purpose of 
impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to the Group’s cash-generating units that are expected to benefit from the  
synergies of the combination, irrespective of whether other assets or liabilities of the Group are assigned to those units. 
Goodwill is reviewed for impairment annually or more frequently if there is an indication of impairment. Impairment of 
goodwill is determined by assessing the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to which the goodwill relates.  
Where the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit is less than the carrying value of the cash-generating unit to 
which goodwill has been allocated, an impairment loss is recognised. Impairment losses relating to goodwill cannot be 
reversed in future periods.
Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Costs, including an appropriate portion of fixed and 
variable overhead expenses, are assigned to inventories held by the method most appropriate to the particular class of 
inventory, with the majority being valued on a first-in-first-out basis. Net realisable value represents the estimated selling 
price for inventories less all estimated costs of completion and costs necessary to make the sale.
Trade and other receivables
Trade and other receivables are recognised when it is probable that a future economic benefit will flow to the Group.  
Trade and other receivables are carried at original invoice or contract amount less any provisions for discounts and doubtful 
debts. Provisions are made where there is evidence of a risk of non-payment taking into account ageing, previous experience 
and general economic conditions.
Sale of receivables under non-recourse factoring
The Group via Stock Polska Sp. z.o.o. has entered into a non-recourse receivables financing agreement with Coface, 
supported by Natixis Bank. It may sell up to €31,891,000 (PLN 140,000,000) (at any one time) at face value less certain 
reserves and fees. Trade receivables sold under this non-recourse factoring arrangement are included net of the value  
of invoices which have been factored. Pursuant to the HSBC Credit Facility, the total amount of receivables subject to  
a factoring facility may not in aggregate exceed €50,000,000.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents in the statement of financial position comprise cash at banks and in hand and short-term deposits 
with an original maturity of three months or less.

Stock Spirits Group PLC 
Annual Report & Accounts 2017  Financial assets
Financial assets in the statement of financial position are loans and receivables. Loans and receivables are non-derivative 
financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market. They are included in current 
assets, except for those with maturities greater than 12 months after the end of the reporting period. These are classified  
as non-current assets.
Loans and receivables are subsequently carried at amortised cost using the effective interest method if the time value of 
money is significant. Gains and losses are recognised in income when the loans and receivables are derecognised or impaired, 
as well as through the amortisation process.
Trade receivables are recognised and carried at the lower of their original invoiced value and recoverable amount. Provision 
is made when there is objective evidence that the Group will not be able to recover balances in full. Balances are written off 
when the probability of recovery is assessed as being remote. 
Purchases or sales of financial assets that require delivery of assets within a time frame established by regulation or 
convention in the market place (regular way trades) are recognised on the trade date, i.e. the date that the Group commits  
to purchase or sell the asset.
Provisions
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past event, 
it is probable that the Group will be required to settle the obligation, and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount  
of the obligation.
The amount recognised as a provision is the best estimate of the consideration required to settle the present obligation 
at the statement of financial position, taking into account the risks and uncertainties surrounding the obligation. Where a 
provision is measured using the cashflows estimated to settle the present obligation, its carrying amount is the present value 
of those cashflows.
When some or all of the economic benefits required to settle a provision are expected to be recovered from a third party, 
the receivable is recognised as an asset if it is virtually certain that reimbursement will be received and the amount of the 
receivable can be measured reliably.
The timing of cash outflows are by their nature uncertain and are therefore best estimates. Provisions are not discounted  
as the time value of money is not deemed to be material.
Financial liabilities
Borrowings and other financial liabilities
Borrowings and other financial liabilities, including loans, are initially measured at fair value, net of transaction costs. 
Borrowings and other financial liabilities are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, 
with interest expense recognised on an effective yield basis. 
The effective interest method is a method of calculating the amortised cost of a financial liability and of allocating interest 
expense over the relevant period. The effective interest rate is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash 
payments through the expected life of the financial liability, or, where appropriate, a shorter period.

Governance Financial Statements 3. Accounting policies continued
Derivative financial instruments
The Group may enter into derivative financial instruments to manage its exposure to interest rate and foreign exchange rate 
risk, including foreign exchange forward contracts, interest rate swaps and cross currency swaps. 
Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value at the date a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently 
remeasured to their fair value at the reporting period date. The resulting gain or loss is recognised in profit or 
loss immediately. 
The fair value of derivatives is classified as a non-current asset or a non-current liability if the remaining maturity of the 
relationship is more than 12 months and as a current asset or a current liability if the remaining maturity of the relationship  
is less than 12 months. 
The Group does not apply hedge accounting.
Fair value measurement
The Group measures financial instruments, such as derivatives, at fair value at each balance sheet date. Fair value is the price 
that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants 
at the measurement date. The fair value measurement is based on the presumption that the transaction to sell the asset or 
transfer the liability takes place either:
• In the principal market for the asset or liability
• In the absence of a principal market, in the most advantageous market for the asset or liability.
The principal or the most advantageous market must be accessible to the Group.
The fair value of an asset or a liability is measured using the assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the 
asset or liability, assuming that market participants act in their economic best interest.
A fair value measurement of a non-financial asset takes into account a market participant’s ability to generate economic 
benefits by using the asset in its highest and best use or by selling it to another market participant that would use the asset  
in its highest and best use.
The Group uses valuation techniques that are appropriate in the circumstances and for which sufficient data are available to 
measure fair value, maximising the use of relevant observable inputs and minimising the use of unobservable inputs. 
All assets and liabilities for which fair value is measured or disclosed in the financial statements are categorised within the  
fair value hierarchy, described as follows, based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement 
as a whole:
• Level 1 — Quoted (unadjusted) market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities
•  Level 2 — Valuation techniques for which the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement  
is directly or indirectly observable
• Level 3 — Valuation techniques for which the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement  
is unobservable.
Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued
at 31 December 2017
118
Stock Spirits Group PLC 
Annual Report & Accounts 2017  For assets and liabilities that are recognised in the financial statements on a recurring basis, the Group determines whether 
transfers have occurred between Levels in the hierarchy by re-assessing categorisation (based on the lowest level input that 
is significant to the fair value measurement as a whole) at the end of each reporting period.
Leases and hire purchase commitments
Leases are classified as finance leases whenever the terms of the lease transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of 
ownership to the lessee. All other leases are classified as operating leases.
Finance leases are capitalised on commencement of the lease at the lower of the fair value of the asset and the present 
value of the minimum lease payments. Each payment is allocated between the liability and finance charges so as to achieve 
a constant rate of interest on the finance balance outstanding. The rental obligations, net of finance charges, are included in 
interest bearing loans and borrowings.
The finance charges are charged to the income statement over the lease period so as to produce a constant periodic rate of 
interest on the remaining balance of the liability for each period.
Payments under operating leases are charged to the income statement on a straight line basis over the term of the lease.
Share-based payments
Equity-settled transactions
The cost of equity-settled transactions is recognised together with a corresponding increase in other reserves in equity, 
over the period in which the performance and/or service conditions are fulfilled. The cumulative expense recognised for 
equity settled transactions at each reporting date until the vesting date reflects the extent to which the vesting period has 
expired and the Group’s best estimate of the number of equity instruments that will ultimately vest. The expense or credit 
for the period represents the movement in cumulative expense recognised as at the beginning and end of the period and is 
recognised in general and administrative expenses.
Where the terms of an equity-settled transaction award are modified, the minimum expense recognised is the expense as 
if the terms had not been modified, if the original terms of the award are met. An additional expense is recognised for any 
modification that increases the total fair value of the share-based payment transaction, or is otherwise beneficial to the 
employee as measured at the date of modification.
Where an equity-settled award is cancelled, it is treated as if it vested on the date of cancellation, and any expense not 
yet recognised for the award is recognised immediately. This includes any award where non-vesting conditions within the 
control of either the entity or the employee are not met. However, if a new award is substituted for the cancelled award, 
and designated as a replacement award on the date that it is granted, the cost based on the original award terms continues 
to be recognised over the original vesting period and an expense is recognised over the remainder of the new vesting 
period for the incremental fair value of any modification.
The financial effect of awards by the parent company of options over its equity shares to employees of subsidiary 
undertakings was recognised by the parent company in its individual financial statements as an increase in its investment 
in subsidiaries with a credit to equity equivalent to the IFRS 2 cost in subsidiary undertakings. The subsidiary, in turn, 
recognised the IFRS 2 cost in its income statement with a credit to equity to reflect the deemed capital contribution from 
the parent company.

Repurchase and reissue of ordinary shares (own shares)
When shares recognised in equity are repurchases, the amount of the consideration paid, which includes directly attributable 
costs, are recognised as a deduction from equity. Repurchased shares are classified as own shares and are presented in the 
own share reserve. When own shares are sold or re-issued subsequently, the amount received is recognised as an increase 
in equity and the resulting surplus or deficit on the transaction is presented within retained earnings.
Cash dividends to equity holders of the parent 
The Company recognises a liability to make cash distributions to equity holders of the parent when the distribution is authorised 
and the distribution is no longer at the discretion of the Company. As per the corporate laws in the United Kingdom, a distribution 
is authorised when it is approved by the shareholders. A corresponding amount is recognised directly in equity. 
Exceptional items and adjusted profitability measures
Management use a range of measures to monitor and assess the Group’s financial performance, including those calculated 
in accordance with IFRS, and other, alternative performance measures (APMs). Such measures are also used in determining 
performance incentives for management.
The Group uses the following APMs to provide management and investors with useful additional information about the 
group’s performance, profitability, liquidity and indebtedness:
• Adjusted EBITDA, being operating profit before depreciation and amortisation and exceptional items and the share of 
results of equity accounted investees (refer to note 7);
• Adjusted basic EPS, being basic earnings per share before the impact of exceptional items (refer to note 14);
• Free cashflow, being cash generated from operating activities (excluding income tax paid), plus the proceeds from the sale 
of property, plant and equipment and proceeds from the disposal of intangible assets less cash used for the acquisition of 
property, plant or equipment and for the acquisition of intangible assets (refer to note 7);
• Adjusted free cashflow conversion, being free cashflow as a percentage of adjusted EBITDA (refer to note 7);
• Net debt, being the net of balances reported as cash and cash equivalents, loans and borrowings, and finance leases 
(refer to note 30); and
• Leverage, being net debt divided by adjusted EBITDA (refer to note 30).
The above measures represent the equivalent IFRS measures but are adjusted to exclude items that we consider would 
prevent comparison of the group’s performance both from one reporting period to another and with other similar businesses. 
Exceptional items are not defined under IFRS. Exceptional items are those significant items which are separately disclosed by 
virtue of their size, nature or incidence to enable a full understanding of the Group’s financial performance. In determining 
of an event or transaction is exceptional, management of the Group considers quantitative and qualitative factors such as 
its expected size, precedent for similar items and the commercial context for the particular transactions, while ensuring 
consistent treatment between favourable or unfavourable transactions impacting income and expense. Presentation of these 
measures is not intended to be a substitute for or to promote them above statutory measures. 
Exceptional items are detailed in note 8 to the financial statements.
Items that are considered to be exceptional and that are therefore separately identified in order to aid comparability may 
include the following: 
• Profits or losses resulting from the disposal of a business or investment; 
120
Stock Spirits Group PLC 
Annual Report & Accounts 2017  • Costs incurred in association with business combinations, such legal and professional fees and stamp duty that are 
excluded from the fair value of the consideration of the business combination; 
• Significant restructuring and integration costs that are incurred following a material change in business operations, such 
as a business combination;
• Impairment charges in respect of tangible and intangible assets as a result of restructuring, business closure, 
underperformance, or other matters; and
• Significant tax charges (current or deferred) in respect of prior years or changes in legislation.
4. Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty
In the application of the Group’s accounting policies, which are described in note 3, management is required to make 
judgements, estimates and assumptions about the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent 
from other sources. Uncertainty about these assumptions and estimates could result in outcomes that require a material 
adjustment to the carrying amount of assets or liabilities affected in future periods. 
Other disclosures relating to the Group’s exposure to risks and uncertainties includes:
• Financial risk management  note 30
• Sensitivity analyses disclosures notes 17, 30.
Judgements
In the process of applying the Group’s accounting policies, management has made the following judgements, which have the 
most significant effect on the amounts recognised in the consolidated financial statements:
Taxation
Management judgement is required to determine the amount of deferred tax assets that can be recognised, based on the 
likely timing and level of future taxable profits together with an assessment of the effect of future tax planning strategies. 
Where Group entities are loss making, and are expected to continue to be loss making into the future it is judged that 
deferred tax assets should not be recognised in respect of these losses as it is not known when the losses will be able to be 
utilised in these entities. 
Estimates and assumptions 
The key assumptions concerning the future and other key sources of estimation uncertainty at the reporting date, that have 
a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amount of assets and liabilities within the next financial 
year are described below. The Group based its assumptions and estimates on parameters available when the consolidated 
financial statements were prepared. However estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. 
Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only 
that period, or in the period of the revision and future periods if the revision affects both current and future periods.
Measurement and impairment of indefinite life intangible assets
A key source of estimation uncertainty that have a significant risk of causing material adjustment to the carrying amounts of 
assets and liabilities within the next financial year is the measurement and impairment of indefinite life intangible assets.  
The measurement of intangible assets other than goodwill on a business combination involves estimation of future cashflows 
and the selection of a suitable discount rate. The Group determines whether indefinite life intangible assets are impaired 
on an annual basis and this requires an estimation of their value in use. This involves estimation of future cashflows and 
choosing a suitable discount rate (note 17). Brands are considered to have an indefinite life. Management considers the 
business to be a brand business and expects to acquire, hold and support brands for an indefinite period.

Governance Financial Statements Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued

4. Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty continued
Estimates and assumptions continued
Impairment of goodwill
The Group’s impairment test for goodwill is based on a value in use calculation using a discounted cashflow model. The 
cashflows are derived from the Group’s three year-plans. The recoverable amount is most sensitive to the discount rate used 
for the discounted cashflow model as well as the expected future cash inflows and the growth rate used for extrapolation 
purposes. The key assumptions used to determine the recoverable amount for the different cash generating units, including a 
sensitivity analysis, as further explained in note 17. The Group tests annually whether goodwill has suffered any impairment.
Taxation and transfer pricing 
The Group is an international drinks business and, as such, transfer pricing arrangements are in place to cover the recharging 
of management costs, as well as the sale of finished goods between Group companies. 
Transfer prices and the policies applied directly affect the allocation of group wide taxable income across a number of  
tax jurisdictions.
While transfer prices between reportable segments are on an arm’s length basis, similar to transactions with third parties, 
there is increasing scrutiny from tax authorities on transfer pricing arrangements. This could result in the creation of 
uncertain tax positions.
The Group provides for anticipated risks, based on reasonable estimates, for tax risks in the respective countries in which 
it operates. The amount of such provisions are based on various factors, such as experience with previous tax audits and 
differing interpretations of tax regulations by the taxable entity and the responsible authority. See note 13.
Uncertainties exist with respect to the interpretation of complex tax regulations, changes in tax laws, and the amount and 
timing of future taxable income. 
Given the wide range of international business relationships and the long-term nature and complexity of existing contractual 
agreements, differences arising between the actual results and the assumptions made, or future changes to such 
assumptions, could necessitate future adjustments to tax income and expense already recorded.
Uncertainties in relation to tax liabilities have been provided for within income tax payable to the extent that it is considered 
probable that the Group will be required to settle a tax liability in the future. Settlement of tax provisions could potentially 
result in future cash tax payments; however these are not expected to result in an increased tax charge as they have been 
fully provided for in accordance with management’s best estimates of the most likely outcomes. 
Significant uncertainty exists over the size of possible settlements of ongoing enquiries and new enquiries could be opened 
into prior years. Hence the tax liabilities could be higher or lower than the amounts provided for.
Share-based payments 
Estimating fair value for share-based payment transactions requires determination of the most appropriate valuation 
model, which is dependent on the terms and conditions of the grant. This estimate also requires determination of the most 
appropriate inputs to the valuation model including the expected life of the share option, volatility and dividend yield and 
making assumptions about them. The assumptions and models used for estimating fair value for share-based payment 
transactions are disclosed in note 34.

6. Segmental analysis
In identifying its operating segments, management follows the Group’s geographic split, representing the main products 
traded by the Group. The Group is considered to have five reportable operating segments: Poland, Czech Republic, Italy, 
Other Operational and Corporate. The Other Operational segment consists of the results of operations of the Slovakian, 
International and Baltic Distillery entities. The Corporate segment consists of expenses and central costs incurred by  
non-trading Group entities.
Each of these operating segments is managed separately as each of these geographic areas requires different marketing 
approaches. All inter-segment transfers are carried out at arm’s length prices. The measure of revenue reported to the 
chief operating decision-maker to assess performance is based on external revenue for each operating segment and 
excludes intra-Group revenues. The measure of Adjusted EBITDA reported to the chief operating decision-maker to assess 
performance is based on operating profit and excludes intra-Group profits, depreciation, amortisation, exceptional items and 
the share of the results of equity-accounted investees.

Annual Report & Accounts 2017  7. Adjusted EBITDA and Free cashflow
The Group defines Adjusted EBITDA as operating profit before depreciation and amortisation, exceptional items and the 
share of results of equity accounted investees. Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted free cashflow conversion are supplemental 
measures of the Group’s performance and liquidity that are not required to be presented in accordance with IFRS. 
The directors use the Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted free cashflow conversion as the performance measures of the business. 
They remove significant items that would otherwise distort comparability. 
The use of these alternative performance measures is consistent with how institutional investors consider the performance of the 
Group. These measures are not defined in IFRS and thus may not be comparable to similarly titled measures by other companies.

In 2017, the Group has exceptional expenses and an exceptional tax charge (2016: €nil).
The impairment review for goodwill identified the need to impair the goodwill held for the Italian brands by €14,900,000. Due to 
the nature of the size of the impairment and the nature of the transaction, it is disclosed as an exceptional expense. See note 17.
Due to a change in tax legislation in Poland, tax amortisation on our Polish brands is no longer available. This has resulted in 
a significant one-off deferred tax charge of €4,700,000, which has been classified in accordance with our accounting policies 
as an exceptional charge. See note 13 for further information.

Post-IPO corporate restructuring
Post-IPO the Group completed corporate restructuring transactions which gave rise to a significant deferred tax assets which 
were being amortised over a five-year period. Due to tax legislation changes in Poland, from 1 January 2018, amortisation 
on these items is no longer deductible for tax purposes. This has resulted in an exceptional tax charge of €4,700,000. The 
charge is considered exceptional because it is a significant transaction resulting from the change in tax legislation. 
The 2016 current tax expense includes €820,000 relating to liquidation of Stock Wodka Polska S.A.

Transfer pricing
The Group is an international drinks business and, as such, transfer pricing arrangements are in place to cover the recharging 
of management and stewardship costs, as well as the sale of finished goods between Group companies. 
Tax inspections
The Group has undertaken a review of potential tax risks and current tax assessments, and whilst it is not possible to predict 
the outcome of any pending enquiries, adequate provisions are considered to have been included in the Group accounts to 
cover any expected estimated future settlements.
Common with many groups operating across multiple jurisdictions, certain tax positions related to intercompany transactions 
may be subject to challenge by the relevant tax authority. The Group has recognised provisions totalling €7,514,000 (2016: 
€7,341,000) in relation to transfer pricing risks where it is not probable that tax positions taken will be accepted. 
The most significant relates to tax risks in respect of our Italian business, Stock S.r.l. The Italian tax authorities have open 
enquiries covering the years 2006-2010. During 2017, no cash prepayments were made in respect of the open enquiries 
(2016: €1,045,000). Any prepayments are returnable to Stock S.r.l. should the rulings be found in favour of the Company. 
The Group’s Czech subsidiary, Stock Plzen Bozkov s.r.o. received a tax assessment relating to 2011 from the Czech tax 
authorities in February 2017. During the year, the tax judgement has not been found in the Company’s favour and hence 
provisions have been made for income tax due of €636,000 and penalties and interest of €631,000 (see note 25 for the 
penalties and interest provision). 
Management continue to vigorously defend each of the companies’ positions through the appeals process in both cases. 
In July 2016, the Group’s Polish subsidiary, Stock Polska Sp. z.o.o., received notification from the Polish tax authorities of the 
commencement of a standard enquiry covering its 2013 corporate income tax return. To date no tax assessment has been 
received in respect of this open enquiry, however the Group anticipates initial findings from this enquiry will be communicated 
within the next 12 months.

Tax inspections continued
In October 2017, the Group’s German subsidiary, Baltic Distillery GmbH, received notification from the German tax 
authorities of the commencement of a standard enquiry covering its 2015 corporate income tax return. To date no final 
tax assessment has been received in respect of this open enquiry, however the Group anticipates initial findings from this 
enquiry will be communicated within the next 12 months.
Although our transfer pricing is performed on an arms’ length basis, it is management’s view that there is significant risk of further 
disputes with tax authorities regarding intercompany transactions and thus a provision has been made for this eventuality. 
Additional provisions, including in respect of the matters noted above, of €2,118,000 were recorded during 2017 (2016: nil).
Whilst it is the case that there could be a risk of a material exposure arising from ongoing enquiries in respect of positions 
taken other than those related to transfer pricing discussed above, the Group considers this to be unlikely and accordingly 
have made no provision in relation to these risks.
In respect of tax years no longer subject to enquiries or audit, where the relevant statute of limitations has expired, and in 
cases where management’s estimation of the most likely future settlement has changed, tax provisions of €1,945,000 (2016: 
nil) were released to profit and loss.
Impact of Brexit
On 29 March 2017, the UK government invoked Article 50 of the Treaty of Lisbon, notifying the European Council of its 
intention to withdraw from the EU. There is an initial two-year timeframe for the UK and EU to reach an agreement on the 
withdrawal and the future UK and EU relationship, although this timeframe can be extended. At this stage, there is significant 
uncertainty about the withdrawal process, its timeframe and the outcome of the negotiations about the future arrangements 
between the UK and the EU. As a result, there is significant uncertainty over the period for which the existing EU laws for 
member states will continue to apply to the UK and which laws will apply to the UK after an exit. Following the negotiations 
between the UK and the EU, the UK’s tax status may change and this may impact the Group, for example as it relates to 
distributions from subsidiaries over which no tax is currently payable due to the EU Parent Subsidiary Directive. However, at 
this stage the level of uncertainty is such that it is impossible to determine if, how and when that tax status will change.
(iii) Unrecognised tax losses
The Group has tax losses which arose in the UK of €32,298,000 as at 31 December 2017 (2016: €31,167,000) that are 
available indefinitely for offset against future taxable profits of the companies in which the losses arose. A deferred tax 
asset has not been recognised in respect of these losses as it is not sufficiently probable that the losses will be utilised in the 
relevant entities.

brands, and calculated using the appropriate substantively enacted tax rate.
(v) Change in tax rates
A reduction in the UK corporation tax rate to 19% (effective from 1 April 2017) was substantively enacted on 15 September 
2016. A further reduction to 17% (effective from 1 April 2020) was also substantively enacted on this date. The deferred tax 
asset or liability at 31 December 2017 has been calculated based on the appropriate tax rates. There are no UK deferred tax 
assets or liabilities to which this new rate will be applied.

14. Earnings per share
Basic earnings per share amounts are calculated by dividing the profit for the year attributable to ordinary equity holders 
of the parent by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year. Diluted earnings per share 
amounts are calculated by dividing the profit attributable to ordinary equity holders of the parent by the weighted average 
number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year plus the weighted average number of ordinary shares that would be 
issued on conversion of all the dilutive potential ordinary shares into ordinary shares. Adjusted earnings per share amounts 
exclude the impact of the significant items that would otherwise distort comparability and distort understanding of the 
underlying performance of the Group.

Annual Report & Accounts 2017  Included in transfers in 2017, was €513,000 for assets which were previously classified as assets under construction, which 
were subsequently reclassified as software. In 2016, the amounts in transfers from assets in the course of constriction to 
software was €141,000. 
Brands are not amortised, as it is considered that their useful economic lives are not limited. An annual impairment assessment is 
performed to ensure carrying values are recoverable. Other intangible assets are amortised as follows:
• Customer Relationships are amortised over 12 years
• Trademarks are amortised over 15 years
• Software is amortised over 2–5 years.
The gross carrying value of fully amortised intangible assets that are still in use is €6,627,000 (2016: €6,033,000).
Amortisation relating to software is included within other operating expenses in the consolidated income statement. 
Amortisation relating to customer relationships and trademark is included in selling expenses.
17. Impairment of goodwill and intangibles with indefinite lives
Goodwill acquired through business combinations and brands have been allocated for impairment testing purposes 
to cash-generating units based on the geographical location of production plants and the ownership of intellectual 
property. This represents the lowest level within the Group at which goodwill and brands are monitored for internal 
management purposes.

Key assumptions used in the value-in-use calculations
The key assumptions used in the estimation of the recoverable amount are set out below. The values assigned to the key 
assumptions represent management’s assessment of future trends in the industry and have been based on historical data 
from both external and internal sources.
The calculation of value-in-use for all regions is most sensitive to the following assumptions:
• Spirits price inflation – small annual percentage increases assumed in all markets based on historic data
• Growth in spirits market – assumed to be static or marginally increasing in all markets based on recent historical trends.
• Market share – through company specific actions outlined in detailed internal plans, market share to be grown overall.
• Discount rates – rates reflect the current market assessment of the risks specific to each operation. The discount rate 
was estimated based on an average of guideline companies adjusted for the operational size of the Group and specific 
regional factors
• Raw material cost – assumed to be at average industry cost
• Excise duty – no future duty changes have been used in projections
• Growth rate used to extrapolate cashflows beyond the forecast period. The assumed growth rate reflects management 
expectation and takes into consideration growth achieved to date, current strategy and expected spirits market growth.
The headroom for each cash generating unit where these sensitivities would be applicable has been detailed below.
Impairment review
(i) Czech Region
The recoverable amount of the Czech Region unit has been based on its value-in-use using discounted cashflows based on 
cashflow projections from the three-year planning process approved by senior management. 
The pre-tax discount rate applied to cashflow projections is 10.7% (2016: 10.3%) and cashflows beyond the three-year 
period are extrapolated using a 2.5% (2016: 1.9%) growth rate. 
A reasonably possible change in two key assumptions could cause the carrying amount to exceed the recoverable amount. 
The following sensitivity analysis shows the impact on the headroom of different pre-tax discount rates and EBITDA delivery 
in the cashflow projections used in the impairment review models.

lower headroom of €3m.

Stock Spirits Group PLC 
Annual Report & Accounts 2017  (ii) Italy Region
The recoverable amount of the Italy Region unit was determined based on its value-in-use using discounted cashflows based 
on cashflow projections from the three-year planning process approved by senior management. 
In the prior year, the headroom between the estimated recoverable amount of the Italy Region CGU and its carrying value was 
limited, and certain sensitised scenarios indicated a potential impairment. As performance in 2017 was below budget, an indicator 
of impairment was identified. The assessment of recoverable amount was performed at the level of the CGU level as it is the 
lowest level of separately identifiable cashflows, and as such is not possible to estimate the recoverable amount at the brand level. 
Due to a continued decline in the market, particularly in relation to vodka-based flavoured liqueur, the projections in the 
Group’s three-year plan were not sufficient to support the carrying value of the assets. As a result of the annual impairment 
tests required by IAS 38, the carrying amount of the assets of the CGU was determined to be higher than its recoverable 
amount of €67.9 million, and an impairment loss of €14.9 million was recognised during 2017 (2016: nil).
The impairment loss was fully allocated to goodwill and included in ‘exceptional expense’ (note 8).
The pre-tax discount rate applied to cashflow projections is 13.5% (2016: 12.7%) and cashflows beyond the three-year 
period are extrapolated using a 1.7% (2016: 1.6%) growth rate. 
Following the impairment loss recognised, recoverable amount was equal to the carrying amount. Therefore, any adverse 
movement in a key assumption would lead to further impairment. The following sensitivity analysis shows the impact on headroom 
of different pre-tax discount rates and EBITDA delivery in the cashflow projections used in the impairment review models.

5% 10.1 6.6 3.6 0.4 (2.3)
10% 14.0 10.3 7.1 3.8 1.0
The impact of a 1 percentage point decrease in the long term growth rate applied in the terminal value calculation would be 
an impairment of €4.2m.
(iii) Poland Region
The recoverable amount of the Poland Region unit has been determined based on its value-in-use using discounted 
cashflows based on cashflow projections from the three-year planning process approved by senior management. 
The pre-tax discount rate applied to cashflow projections 10.3% (2016: 9.6%) and cashflows beyond the three-year period 
are extrapolated using a 1.7% (2016: 2.4%) growth rate. 
The recoverable amount calculated indicates significant headroom over the carrying value exists. As such, there are no 
assumptions for which a reasonably possible change will result in an impairment.

Stock Spirits Group PLC 
Annual Report & Accounts 2017  22. Investment in equity-accounted investees
On 17 July 2017, Stock Spirits entered into an agreement with Quintessential Brands Group for the acquisition of a 
25% equity interest in Quintessential Brands Ireland Whiskey Limited for a cash consideration of up to €18,333,000. 
Consideration comprised of an initial cash payment of €15,000,000 for 25% of the equity interest, and a contingent 
consideration of up to €3,333,000 which is payable over a five year period, subject to performance conditions.
The fair value of the contingent cash consideration at the acquisition date has been calculated as €2,491,000. See note 24 
(other financial liabilities) and note 30 (risk management). 
Based on the fair value of assets and liabilities of the investee at the acquisition date, goodwill of €425,000 was recognised. 
The Group’s share of the loss of Quintessential Brands Ireland Whiskey Limited for the period is €331,000.
The principal place of business of Quintessential Brands Ireland Whiskey Limited is Dublin, Ireland.
The following table summarises the financial information of Quintessential Brands Ireland Whiskey Limited as included in its 
own financial statements, adjusted for fair value adjustments at acquisition and differences in accounting policies, as at

1.  The Group has a facilities agreement for a €200,000,000 revolving credit facility (RCF) with a banking club consisting of five banks 
including HSBC who also act as the Agent. The term of the RCF facility is five years. The facility is fully flexible and allows the Group 
to benefit from being able to increase or reduce borrowings as required, and utilise balance sheet cash more effectively. Each of the 
drawings under the RCF are drawn down in the local currencies. The loans bear variable rates of interest which are linked to the inter-
bank offer rates of the country of drawing, WIBOR, PRIBOR or EURIBOR as appropriate. Please refer to the table below for the balances 
drawn down. Each of the loans have a variable margin element to the interest charge. The margin is linked to a ratchet mechanism, 
subject to a minimum margin, as the Group’s leverage covenant decreases.
  As well as RCF drawings of €114,191,000 as at 31 December 2017 (2016: €134,319,000), an additional €14,250,000 (2016: 
€14,751,000) of the RCF was utilised for customs guarantees in Italy and Germany. These custom guarantees reduce the available RCF 
but do not constitute a balance sheet liability.
  On 21 July 2017, Stock Spirits Group extended its revolving credit facilities with its banking club by a further 2 years to November 2022. 
The key facility terms remain unchanged.
2.   Costs of arranging the Group banking facilities are deducted from the original measurement of the loan facilities and amortised into 
finance costs throughout the period using the effective interest method. The arrangement fees under the facility totalled €300,000, and 
these are being amortised into finance costs throughout the initial period of the new facility. Fees for the extension of the facility until 
2022 are being amortised over the loan period. The balance of the fees remaining is €196,000.

25. Provisions continued
(i) Employee benefits and pensions:
 The provision for employee benefits represents expenses recognised in relation to a long-term incentive plan (LTIP) 
operated by the Group, and Czech and Polish pension commitments for retirement benefits. 
 The long-term incentive plan which existed prior to admission was amended so that 50%-70% of accrued awards 
crystallised upon admission, being paid out in cash. All remaining awards became exercisable in October 2014. At the 
company’s discretion these options can be satisfied in cash and consequently these have been accounted for as long-term 
employee benefits under IFRS 2 Share Based Payments. 
 During 2017 no LTIP options were exercised (2016: 172,399 options exercised).
(ii) Employee severance indemnity:
  The Group operates an employee severance indemnity, mandatory for Italian companies, for qualifying employees of its 
Italian subsidiary. Under IAS 19 (Revised), this represents an unfunded defined benefit plan and is based on the working life 
of employees and on the remuneration earned by an employee over the course of a pre-determined term of service.
  The most recent actuarial valuations of the present value of the severance indemnity obligation were carried out at  
31 December 2017 by an actuary. 
 The present value of the severance indemnity obligation, and the related current service cost and past service cost, 
were measured using the projected unit credit method. The principal assumptions used for the purposes of the actuarial 
valuations were as follows: discount rate 1.92% p.a. (2016: 2.33% p.a.), inflation 2.00% p.a. (2016: 2.00% p.a.), revaluation 
rate 75% of inflation rate + 1.5 points = 3.00% p.a. (2016: 1.80% p.a.).

late interest payment for the 2011 tax assessment in the Czech Republic. The Company will continue to defend the 
assessment through the appeals process available
(iv)  Legal and contract related provisions: relate to exposures for potential contractual penalties arising in the normal course 
of business. Provisions are recognised where a legal or constructive obligation exists at the year end date and where a 
reliable estimate can be made of the likely outcome. While these provisions are reviewed on a regular basis and adjusted 
for management’s best current estimates, the judgemental nature of these items means that future amounts settled may 
differ from those provided
(v)  Other provisions: relate primarily to sales agent indemnity fees and other various miscellaneous provisions. Provisions are 
recognised where a legal or constructive obligation exists at the year end date and where a reliable estimate can be made 
of the likely outcome. While these provisions are reviewed on a regular basis and adjusted for management’s best current 
estimates, the judgemental nature of these items means that future amounts settled may differ from those provided.

Stock Spirits Group PLC 
Annual Report & Accounts 2017  30. Risk management 
The Group is exposed to a variety of risks such as market risk, credit risk and liquidity risk. The Group’s principal financial 
liabilities are loans and borrowings. The Group also has trade and other receivables, trade and other payables, indirect tax 
payables and cash and cash equivalents that arise directly from operations. This note provides further detail on financial risk 
management and includes quantitative information on the specific risks.
The Group’s senior management oversees the management of these risks, and agrees the policies for managing each of these 
risks. These are summarised below.
Market risk
Market risk is the risk that the fair value of future cashflows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in 
market prices. The Group’s exposure is primarily to the financial risks of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and 
interest rates. Financial instruments affected by market risk include loans and borrowings.
All Group borrowings are subject to the variable rates based on WIBOR, PRIBOR and EURIBOR, as stated per the HSBC loan 
facility agreement.
The Group has not entered into any derivatives to hedge foreign currency risk in relation to the HSBC facility. Each facility and 
the resulting cash outflows are denominated in local currency. The cashflows are therefore economically hedged within each 
market. Management have considered the foreign currency risk exposure and consider the risk to be adequately mitigated.
Sensitivity analysis 
The Company recognises that movements in certain risk variables (such as interest rates or foreign exchange rates) might 
affect the amounts recorded in its equity and its profit and loss for the period. Therefore the Company has assessed:
• What would be reasonably possible changes in the risk variables at the end of the reporting period
• The effects on profit or loss and equity if such changes in the risk variables were to occur. 
147
Strategic Review Governance Financial Statements Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued

30. Risk management continued
Interest rate risk
The following table demonstrates the sensitivity to a reasonably possible change in interest rates on the Group’s floating rate 
loans and borrowings at which at the end of 31 December 2017 are not hedged. With all other variables being constant the 
Group’s profit before tax is affected through the impact on floating rate borrowings as follows.

The assigned movement in basis points for interest rate sensitivity analysis is based upon the currently observable  
market environment. 
The Group cash balances are held in current bank financial statements and earn immaterial levels of interest. Management 
have concluded that any changes in the EURIBOR rates will have an immaterial impact on interest income earned on the 
Group cash balances. No interest rate sensitivity has been included in relation to the Group’s cash balances.
Foreign currency risk
The following tables consider the impact on profit before tax arising from the conversion of non-domestic currency trade 
debtor, trade creditor and cash balances in our Polish, Czech and UK Group entities should there be a change in the spot €/

Stock Spirits Group PLC 
Annual Report & Accounts 2017  Credit risk
Credit risk is the risk that a counterparty will not meet its obligations under a financial instrument or customer contract, 
leading to a financial loss. The Group is exposed to credit risk from its operating activities (primarily for trade receivables)  
and from its financing activities, including deposits with banks and financial institutions, foreign exchange transactions and 
other financial instruments.
Trade receivables
Customer credit risk is managed by each business unit subject to the Group’s established policy, procedures and control 
relating to customer credit risk management. Outstanding customer receivables are regularly monitored and credit 
insurance is used where applicable. The credit quality of trade receivables that are neither past due nor impaired is 
assessed by reference to external credit ratings where available, otherwise historical information relating to counterparty 
default rates is used. The Group continually assesses the recoverability of trade receivables and the level of provisioning 
required. Refer to note 20 for details of the age of accounts receivable which are past due.
The carrying amount of accounts receivable is reduced by an allowance account and the amount of loss is recognised within 
the consolidated income statement. When a receivable balance is considered uncollectible, it is written off against the 
allowance for doubtful accounts. Subsequent recoveries of amounts previously written off are credited to the consolidated 
income statement. Refer to note 20 for details the movement in allowance for doubtful debts. Management does not believe 
that the Group is subject to any significant credit risk in view of the Group’s large and diversified client base which is located 
in several jurisdictions.
Other receivables and financial assets
Other receivables and financial assets consist largely of VAT and excise duty receivables and customs guarantees.  
As the counterparties are Revenue and Customs Authorities in the various jurisdictions in which the Group operates,  
credit risk is considered to be minimal and therefore no further analysis has been performed. 
Financial instruments and cash deposits
Credit risk from balances with banks and financial institutions is managed in accordance with the Group’s policy. The Group 
deposits cash with reputable financial institutions, from which management believes loss to be remote. The Group’s 
maximum exposure to credit risk for the components of the statement of financial position at 31 December 2017 and 
31 December 2016 is the carrying amounts as illustrated in notes 23 and 32. The Group’s maximum exposure for financial 
guarantees are noted in either note 23 or in the liquidity table below, respectively.

Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due. The Group manages 
liquidity risk by maintaining adequate cash reserves and borrowing facilities, by continuously monitoring forecast and actual 
cashflows and matching the maturity profiles of financial assets and liabilities.
The table below summarises the maturity profile of the Group’s undiscounted financial liabilities at 31 December 2017 
and 2016.

The RCF agreement which was signed in 2015 was for a term of five years. The facility is fully flexible, with the amount 
borrowed being reset each month. On 21 July 2017, Stock Spirits Group extended its revolving credit facilities with its 
banking club by a further two years to November 2022. Interest payable on interest bearing loans for the term of the facility 
has been estimated using amounts drawn at 31 December 2017, and the interest rates and margins applicable at this time. 
The Group has €71,599,000 of undrawn facilities available to it under the terms of the RCF. Refer to note 23.
The contingent consideration’s fair value measurement (Level 3) has been performed using a discounted cashflow based on 
a series of unobservable inputs. Management have used all available information about likely future trading of Quintessential 
Brands Ireland Whiskey Limited to determine to determine the fair value of the contingent consideration.

Stock Spirits Group PLC 
Annual Report & Accounts 2017  Capital risk management
The primary objective of the Group’s capital management is to ensure that it has the capital required to operate and grow 
the business at a reasonable cost of capital without incurring undue financial risks. The Board periodically reviews its capital 
structure to ensure it meets changing business needs. 
In addition, the Directors consider the management of debt to be an important element in controlling the capital structure 
of the Group. The Group may carry significant levels of long term structural and subordinated debt to fund investments and 
acquisitions and has arranged debt facilities to allow for fluctuations in working capital requirements. There have been no 
changes to the capital requirements in the current period. 
Management manage capital on an ongoing basis to ensure that covenants requirements on the third party debt are met.
The Group regards its total capital as follows:

Fair value
Management assessed that cash and cash equivalents, trade receivables, trade payables and other current liabilities 
approximate their carrying amounts largely due to the short-term maturities of these instruments.
As per the table below the carrying amounts of the Group’s financial instruments are considered to be a reasonable 
approximation of their fair values.

Performance share plan (PSP)
Participation in the PSP is restricted to the Senior Management Team. Awards made under the PSP normally vest provided 
the participant remains in the Group’s employment during the performance period and financial targets are met at the end of 
the performance period. 
In the 2017 plan, financial targets were based 50% on EBITDA targets and 50% on cashflow conversion for senior 
management excluding the Executive Directors. For Executive Directors the performance conditions were 50% EPS targets 
and 50% cashflow conversion targets.
In the 2015 plan, financial targets were based on total shareholder return (TSR), versus comparator companies, and earnings 
per share (EPS). In the 2014 plan, financial targets were based on TSR only. 
The performance period for all PSP schemes is three financial years beginning with the financial year in which the award is 
granted. The vesting period for grants made under this scheme is three years with an exercise period of seven years. The 
exercise price of PSP options is €nil.
Further information on the PSP is set out in the Directors’ Remuneration Report on pages 71 to 84.

Stock Spirits Group PLC 
Annual Report & Accounts 2017  Awards were granted over 1,611,583 shares on 15 March 2017 (2016: nil shares). These new options were valued using  
the Black-Scholes model. Dividends accrue to the participants prior to option exercise. 
The compensation expense recognised in relation to these awards is based on the fair value of the awards at grant date. 
The fair value of nil cost options subject to the TSR condition is determined using a Monte-Carlo option pricing model.  
The fair value of all other options is calculated using the share price at the date of grant, adjusted for dividends not received 
during the vesting period.

Stock Spirits Group PLC 
Annual Report & Accounts 2017  1. General information
These separate financial statements were approved and authorised for issue by the Board of Directors of Stock Spirits  
Group PLC (the Company) on 7 March 2018.
The Company’s registered office is at Solar House, Mercury Park, Wooburn Green, Buckinghamshire, HP10 0HH, 
United Kingdom.
2. Accounting policies
Basis of preparation
These separate financial statements of the Company are presented as required by the Companies Act 2006 (the Act).  
As permitted by the Act, the separate financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial 
Reporting Standards (IFRS), as adopted by the European Union.
International Financial Reporting Standards are issued by the International Accounting Standard Board (IASB). 
The financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis as the Directors believe there are no material 
uncertainties that lead to significant doubt that the entity can continue as a going concern for a period of at least 12 months 
from the date of approval of the financial statements.
The financial statements are presented in Sterling (£), rounded to the nearest thousand (£000) unless otherwise stated. They 
have been prepared under the historical cost convention.
These financial statements have been prepared for the year ended 31 December 2017.
Exemptions
The Directors have taken advantage of the exemption available under Section 408 of the Companies Act 2006 and not 
presented an income statement or a statement of comprehensive income for the Company alone. The profit for the year has 
been disclosed in the statement of changes in equity. 
New/Revised standards and interpretations adopted in 2017
The following amendments to existing standards and interpretations were effective for the year, but either they were not 
applicable to or did not have a material impact on the Company:
• Amendments to IAS 7: IAS 7 Disclosure initiative 
• Amendments to IAS 12: IAS 12 Recognition of Deferred Tax Assets for Unrealised Losses
• Annual Improvements to IFRS Standards 2014–2016 Cycle – Minor amendments to IFRS 12.

New/Revised standards and interpretations not applied
The following standards and interpretations in issue are not yet effective for the Company and have not been adopted by  
the Company:

Amendments to IAS 40: Transfers of Investment Property 1 January 2018
IFRIC Interpretation 22: Foreign Currency Transactions and Advance Consideration 1 January 2018
IFRS 16: Leases 1 January 2019
The Directors do not expect the adoption of these standards and interpretations to have a material impact on the Company 
financial statements in the period of initial application. 
The Directors have completed an assessment of the potential impact of IFRS 9, and don’t believe that it will have a material 
impact on the results of the Company. Due to the nature of the Company’s operations it will not be impacted by IFRS 15 or 
IFRS 16. The Company will continue to monitor any potential impact as the new standards become more imminent. 
1.  The effective dates stated above are those given in the original IASB/IFRIC standards and interpretations. As the Company prepares 
its financial statements in accordance with IFRS as adopted by the European Union (EU), the application of new standards and 
interpretations will be subject to their having been endorsed for use in the EU via the EU Endorsement mechanism. In the majority of 
cases this will result in an effective date consistent with that given in the original standard or interpretation but the need for endorsement 
restricts the Company’s discretion to early adopt standards. 
Investments
Investments in subsidiary undertakings are valued at cost, less accumulated impairment. 
Share-based compensation
Equity-settled transactions
The cost of equity-settled transactions is recognised together with a corresponding increase in other reserves in equity, over 
the period in which the performance and/or service conditions are fulfilled. The cumulative expense recognised for equity 
settled transactions at each reporting date until the vesting date reflects the extent to which the vesting period has expired 
and the Company’s best estimate of the number of equity instruments that will ultimately vest. The expense or credit for 
the period represents the movement in cumulative expense recognised as at the beginning and end of the period and is 
recognised in general and administrative expenses.
Where the terms of an equity-settled transaction award are modified, the minimum expense recognised is the expense as 
if the terms had not been modified, if the original terms of the award are met. An additional expense is recognised for any 
modification that increases the total fair value of the share-based payment transaction, or is otherwise beneficial to the 
employee as measured at the date of modification.
Notes to the Parent Company financial statements continued
at 31 December 2017
164
Stock Spirits Group PLC 
Annual Report & Accounts 2017  Where an equity-settled award is cancelled, it is treated as if it vested on the date of cancellation, and any expense not 
yet recognised for the award is recognised immediately. This includes any award where non-vesting conditions within the 
control of either the entity or the employee are not met. However, if a new award is substituted for the cancelled award, and 
designated as a replacement award on the date that it is granted, the cost based on the original award terms continues to be 
recognised over the original vesting period and an expense is recognised over the remainder of the new vesting period for 
the incremental fair value of any modification.
The financial effect of awards by the Company of options over its equity shares to employees of subsidiary undertakings 
is recognised by the parent company, in its individual financial statements, as an increase in the costs of investments in 
its subsidiaries, with the corresponding credit being recognised directly in equity as a credit to the share-based payments 
reserve equivalent to the IFRS 2 cost. 
Repurchase and reissue of ordinary shares (own shares)
When shares recognised in equity are repurchased the amount of consideration paid, which includes directly attributable 
costs, is recognised as a deduction from equity. Repurchased shares are classified as own shares and are presented in the 
own share reserve. When own shares are sold or re-issued subsequently, the amount received is recognised as an increase in 
equity and the resulting surplus or deficit on the transaction is presented within retained earnings.
Loans and receivables
Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in 
an active market. They are included in current assets, except for maturities greater than 12 months after the end of 
the reporting period. These are classified as non-current assets. The Company’s loans and receivables comprise Other 
receivables and Cash and cash equivalents in the balance sheet.
Other receivables
Other receivables are non-interest bearing and are recognised initially at fair value, and subsequently at amortised cost, 
reduced by appropriate allowances for estimated irrecoverable amounts.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents in the statement of financial position comprise cash at banks and in hand and short-term deposits 
with an original maturity of three months or less.
Trade and other payables 
Trade and other payables are initially recognised at fair value and subsequently at amortised cost, using the effective interest 
rate method.
Cash dividends to equity holders 
The Company recognises a liability to make cash distributions to equity holders of the parent when the distribution is authorised 
and the distribution is no longer at the discretion of the Company. As per the corporate laws in the United Kingdom, an interim 
distribution is authorised by the Board, whilst a final distribution is authorised when it is approved by the shareholders.

Merger reserve
On 21 October 2013 129,064,871 shares were issued in exchange for shares in OCM Luxembourg Spirits Holdings S.à.r.l. 
The net book value of OCM Luxembourg Spirits Holdings S.à.r.l. at the time of exchange was £96,743,000, which resulted 
in £83,837,000 being credited to the merger reserve in line with merger relief provided by Section 612 of the Company 
Act 2006. On 25 October 2013 the Company was admitted to the London Stock Exchange and placed 22,127,660 ordinary 
£0.10 shares at a premium of £2.25 pence per share. Also included in share premium are capitalised listing costs, which have 
been incurred directly in connection with the registration and distribution of shares.
Own share reserve
The own share reserve comprises the cost of the Company’s shares, which are held by the Employment Benefit Trust (EBT) 
on behalf of the employees until the options are exercised. At 31 December 2017 the EBT held 822,246 of the Company’s 
shares (2016: 2,638,440).
The EBT holds the shares at cost. The shares held prior to 2015 were acquired for the exercise of Jointly Owned Equity 
(JOE) Share subscriptions agreements, as well as Top-Up option and Substitute option agreements. Ownership of the JOE 
Share subscription agreements was shared between the EBT and the Executive Directors, and therefore the total cost to the 
EBT was minimal. Top-Up and Substitute option agreements were allocated to the EBT on IPO for nil payment. Consequently 
no own share reserve has been presented prior to 2015. In 2015 shares were acquired at market value for LTIP options, 
which became exercisable in October 2014. 
Share-based compensation reserve
Share-based compensation reserve includes the credit to equity for equity-settled share-based payments. Please see note 12 
for full details. The equity charge for the year ending 31 December 2017 was £1,729,000 (2016: £20,000).

11. Risk management
The Company’s principal financial liabilities are trade and other payables. The Company’s principal financial assets include 
other debtors, prepayments and cash and cash equivalents that derive directly from its operations. 
The Company is exposed to a variety of risks including market risk, credit risk and liquidity risk. The Company’s senior 
management oversees the management of these risks, and agrees the policies for managing each of these risks. These are 
summarised below.
Credit risk
Credit risk is the risk that a counterparty will not meet its obligations under a financial instrument, leading to a financial loss. 
The Company is exposed to credit risk from its financing activities, including deposits with banks and financial institutions.
Financial instruments and cash deposits
Credit risk from balances with banks and financial institutions is managed in accordance with the Group’s policy (refer to 
note 30 of the consolidated financial statements). The Company deposits cash with reputable financial institutions, from 
which management believes loss to be remote. The Company’s maximum exposure to credit risk for the components of the 
statement of financial position at 31 December 2017 is the carrying amounts as illustrated in note 6. 
Other receivables and prepayments
Other receivables and prepayments consist largely of amounts receivable from subsidiaries. As there are deemed to be no 
going concern issues with any of the individual group entities loss is considered to be remote, and consequently credit risk is 
minimal and no further analysis has been performed. 
Fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities

financial statements.

Stock Spirits Group PLC 
Annual Report & Accounts 2017  Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Company will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due. The Company 
manages liquidity risk by maintaining adequate cash reserves, by continuously monitoring forecast and actual cashflows and 
matching the maturity profiles of financial assets and liabilities.
The table below summarises the maturity profile of the Company’s undiscounted financial liabilities.

Market risk
Market risk is the risk that the fair value of future cashflows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in 
market prices. The Company’s exposure is primarily to the financial risks of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and 
interest rates. Financial instruments affected by market risk are limited to cash and cash equivalents.
Currency risk
The Company engages in foreign currency transactions to a very limited extent. No financial assets or liabilities are held in 
foreign currencies. Due to the Company’s lack of exposure to currency risk no sensitivity analysis has been performed.
Interest rate risk
The Company has no interest bearing financial liabilities, and its interest bearing financial assets consist of only cash and cash 
equivalents. As such exposure to interest rate risk is limited and no sensitivity analysis has been performed.
Capital risk management
The Board’s objectives and policies for the Company are consistent with those of the Group. Full details are provided in note 
30 of the consolidated financial statements.
RCF financing facility
On 18 November 2015 the Group signed a facilities agreement for a €200,000,000 revolving credit facility (RCF) with a 
banking club consisting of five banks including HSBC who also act as the Agent. The term of the RCF facility was originally 
five years. On 21 July 2017, the Group extended its RCF with its banking club by a further two years to November 2022. 
The key facility terms remain unchanged. See note 23 of the consolidated financial statements for further details.

Governance Financial Statements 12. Share-based compensation
Jointly owned equity scheme
The Company and former shareholder (Oaktree) previously entered into a number of Jointly Owned Equity (JOE) Share 
Subscription Agreements with key members of Group management employees. 
Prior to IPO management employees were invited to subscribe for an interest in the growth in value of Class F ordinary shares 
(F shares) in OCM Luxembourg Spirits Holdings S.à.r.l. jointly with Elian Employee Benefit Trustee Limited acting in its capacity 
as trustee of the Stock Spirits Employee Benefit Trust (EBT). The EBT holds the JOE scheme shares on behalf of the employees.
At IPO the 200 F Shares issued under the JOE scheme were converted into ordinary £0.10 shares of Stock Spirits Group PLC 
(PLC), the new ultimate parent company of the Group at the rate of 1 F share to 17,886 PLC ordinary shares. The conversion 
was accounted for as a replacement under IFRS 2.

Post IPO awards were valued by reference to the share price at admission to the London Stock Exchange.
The EBT holds the shares for all vested share options. At IPO several members of key management were issued a total of 
1,538,124 £0.10 ordinary share options in Stock Spirits Group PLC. The options vested immediately upon grant.
Included within the terms of the grant the employee agrees to receive their options net of a deduction to allow the Company 
to settle any personal income taxes on behalf of the recipient. Consequently there is no liability to the Company on exercise 
of the options.

Stock Spirits Group PLC 
Annual Report & Accounts 2017  Performance share plan (PSP)
Participation in the PSP is restricted to the Senior Management Team. Awards made under the PSP normally vest provided 
the participant remains in the Group’s employment during the performance period and financial targets are met at the end of 
the performance period. 
In the 2017 plan, financial targets were based 50% on EBITDA targets and 50% on cashflow conversion for senior management 
excluding the Executive Directors. For Executive Directors the performance conditions were 50% EPS targets and 50% 
cashflow conversion targets,
In the 2015 plan, financial targets were based on total shareholder return (TSR), versus comparator companies, and earnings 
per share (EPS). In the 2014 plan, financial targets were based on TSR only. 
The performance period for all PSP schemes is three financial years beginning with the financial year in which the award is 
granted. The vesting period for grants made under this scheme is three years with an exercise period of seven years. The 
exercise price of PSP options is £nil.
Further information on the PSP is set out in the Directors’ Remuneration Report on pages 67 to 84.
Awards were granted over 1,611,583 shares on 15 March 2017 (2016: nil shares). These new options were valued using the 
Black-Scholes model. Dividends accrue to the participants prior to option exercise. 
The compensation expense recognised in relation to these awards is based on the fair value of the awards at grant date. 
The fair value of nil cost options subject to the TSR condition is determined using a Monte-Carlo option pricing model.  
The fair value of all other options is calculated using the share price at the date of grant, adjusted for dividends not 
received during the vesting period.
The principal assumptions made in measuring the fair value of PSP awards were as follows:
 2017 PSP 2015 PSP 2014 PSP
Principal assumptions
Fair value at grant date 187 pence 41.0 pence 192.5 pence
Share price on grant date 187 pence 196.5 pence 292.3 pence
Expected life of the awards 3 years 3 years 3 years
Risk free rate interest rate 0% 0.74% 1.12%
Dividend yield on the Company’s shares n/a 1.52% 1.06%
Volatility of the Company’s shares n/a 23.9% 21.6%
TSR correlation (SSG PLC vs comparators) n/a 20.7% 25.0%
Due to the limited historic data available for Stock Spirits Group (SSG) PLC expected volatility was based on the historic 
volatilities of the companies in the TSR comparator group.

Restricted stock options (RSU):
On 15 March 2017, awards were granted over 534,419 shares (2016: nil shares). 
Participation in the 2017 RSU is restricted to the Senior Management Team, who were previously included in the 2014 
or 2015 PSP schemes and still employed by the Group in March 2017. There are no performance conditions. Vesting is 
dependent upon continued employment as at the date of the announcement of the 2018 results. No dividends accrue to  
the participants prior to exercise.
The exercise price of RSU options is £nil.
The compensation expense recognised in relation to these awards is based on the fair value of the awards at grant date.

In 2016, 1,000,000 awards were issued to the Managing Director of the Polish business. The awards will vest provided that 
this participant remains in the Group’s employment during the performance period and various financial targets are met.  
The performance period is the period of three financial years beginning with the financial year in which the award was

exercise price of these awards is £nil.
All performance conditions over the period of two financial years must be met for any awards to vest.
