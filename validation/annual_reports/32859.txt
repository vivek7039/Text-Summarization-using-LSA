 ABU DHABI, UAE ALGERIA IRAQ OMAN
     
The highlight was progress on  
the UZ750 offshore project at the 
Upper Zakum oil field, our share of 
which is valued at US$3.5 billion.  
At the height of the project some 
14,000 workers were involved, 
including 5,000 onsite, and it 
reached more than 58 million  
man-hours LTI free. During 2017 , 
we delivered and installed all of  
the modules, and contract 
completion is set for mid-2018.
An important milestone was the 
completion and commissioning  
of the In Salah southern fields 
development. We also introduced 
gas into the Reggane North 
Development plant and, by the close 
of the year, we were ready for the 
introduction of gas into the Alrar plant.
Building on our success in Iraq,  
securing several new contract 
awards and extensions which, 
together, are worth more than 
US$300 million. These include 
engineering, operations and 
maintenance services agreements 
with international oil companies, 
plus we extended our long-term 
contract with Basra Oil Company 
and expanded our scope  
of services.
On our upstream projects, we 
completed Phase 1 of the Khazzan 
central processing facility for BP  
and were awarded Phase 2.  
We also secured a 10-year EPCm 
framework agreement with 
Petroleum Development Oman, 
which builds on our work on the 
Rabab Harweel Integrated project 
and Yibal Khuff project. In terms  
of downstream projects, the Sohar 
refinery is now in commercial 
operation, and we were awarded  
the Duqm Refinery project,  
in a 50/50 joint venture with 
Samsung Engineering.

 MALAYSIA SAUDI ARABIA UK KUWAIT
      
Malaysia continues to be an 
important market for Petrofac. 
Production levels remain in line with 
expectations at Block PM304, which 
we operate on behalf of PETRONAS, 
and we continue to make good 
progress on the US$500 million 
Refinery and Petrochemicals 
Integrated Development (RAPID) 
EPCC project.
In Saudi Arabia we continue  
to build on our downstream 
credentials. By the close of the year 
we had reached commissioning 
phase for both the Petro Rabigh 
petrochemicals plant and the 
Jazan South tank farm project.
In September 2017 , Petrofac 
marked 20 years since we first 
pioneered the outsourced Duty 
Holder model in the North Sea. 
During the year, we secured a 
number of contract awards and 
extensions, including a three-year 
extension of a maintenance 
services contract with BP and a 
12-month extension for engineering 
services with Chevron.
We successfully reached the  
pre-commissioning phase of  
the KNPC Clean Fuels Project  
for Kuwait National Petroleum.  
We also secured a lump-sum  
EPC project with Kuwait Oil 
Company, valued at US$1 .3 billion,  
for GC32, the first sour oil and  
gas gathering centre in the  
Burgan oil field.

OPERATIONAL PROGRESS IN 2017
Across our portfolio of lump-sum projects, we delivered more than 217 
million man-hours, maintained an excellent safety record and secured 
US$4.1 billion of new orders. Meanwhile, in our reimbursable business,  
we secured contract awards and extensions valued at US$1.1 billion.  
In IES, we made good progress in re-shaping our portfolio and improving 
performance. By the close of the year, our order backlog stood at 
US$10.2 billion, giving us good revenue visibility.

In the face of the intense scrutiny that 
followed, executive management focused 
successfully on the business: we retained our 
clients’ support, saw a good recovery in new 
orders, protected our liquidity, reduced our 
capital intensity, and continued to focus on 
strong execution.
Our response to the investigation
Clearly, for much of 2017 , the Board’s 
attention was dominated by the SFO 
investigation. In May, we took steps to 
ring-fence the investigation from Petrofac’s 
day-to-day business operations, and 
ensure that we responded to the SFO.
Our response included: formation of a 
dedicated Board Committee to govern this 
matter; the appointment of a senior external 
specialist to oversee the Company’s 
management of, and response to, the 
investigation; the restriction of Group Chief 
Executive Ayman Asfari to his operational 
duties; and the suspension of Group Chief 
Operating Officer Marwan Chedid, who 
resigned from the Board. It is important to 
stress that these latter actions do not in any 
way seek to pre-judge the outcome of the 
SFO’s investigation. Further details of the 
investigation and our response are set out 
on page 78.
Enhancing our compliance
Prior to the instigation of this external 
investigation, steps had been taken to 
further enhance the Company’s approach 
to compliance, including a root and branch 
review of all related policies and processes, 
as detailed on pages 64 and 65. In August 
2017 , a new Compliance and Ethics 
Committee was formed. The inaugural 
report of this Committee is set out on pages 
88 and 89. These measures ensure that we 
can continue to be confident in our people 
and processes.
Operational progress in 2017
Operationally, 2017 was a good year.  
The Board kept close oversight of progress 
against the business strategy. We took a 
particularly close interest in the headway 
the management team is making in 
delivering organic growth and further 
differentiating the business. We also 
received regular updates on the 
deployment of new digital technologies, 
and the role they can play in bringing 
continual incremental improvements  
to our service offering.

MAINTAINING A STRONG BOARD FOR THE FUTURE
2017 revealed Petrofac’s 
underlying resilience.  
We continued to execute 
effectively, maintain  
our bidding discipline and 
enhance return on capital. 
For 2017 , our main intention was to deliver 
on the themes I highlighted last year: 
focusing on execution, delivering organic 
growth, and reducing capital intensity. 
By the middle of the year, however, events 
had been overtaken by the instigation of  
an investigation by the UK Serious Fraud 
Office (SFO). The Board took swift action, 
formulating a strategy to run and protect 
the business whilst responding to, and 
engaging constructively, with the SFO in 
relation to the investigation.

CHAIRMAN’S STATEMENT Separately, at the Annual General Meeting 
in May 2018, we will be delighted to 
recommend to shareholders the appointment 
of David Davies as a Non-executive Director. 
Reflecting on our financial performance
In the face of the challenging environment, 
we were pleased to deliver a business 
performance net profit of US$343 million. 
Post exceptional items and certain 
re-measurements, we reported a net loss 
of US$29 million. With good performance 
on capital management and net debt  
falling to US$612 million, we demonstrated 
our strong financial discipline and our 
determination to reduce capital intensity. 
We also chose to re-base our dividend in 
May 2017 and this prudent approach was 
broadly welcomed by investors. We are 
therefore proposing a final dividend of 
25.30 pence per share. 
Against this backdrop, I do want to thank 
all Petrofac shareholders for your loyalty. 
During the year, we benefited from a frank 
and constructive dialogue with our key 
shareholders and, as this Annual Report 
should demonstrate, the Board is 
determined to repay your confidence.
Looking forward to 2018 and beyond
For 2018, we expect the market 
environment to remain similar to 2017 .  
We will continue to be competitive and 
maintain our bidding discipline. However, 
we do benefit from good visibility of 
projects to be awarded during the year, 
and will continue to ensure we maintain  
our cost competitiveness through our 
focus on operational excellence.
From an operational perspective, our 
approach will continue to be characterised 
by these three themes: flawless execution, 
reduced capital intensity, and organic 
growth. At the same time, the Board will 
ensure that we continue to engage with 
the SFO.
One of our intentions for 2017 had been  
to review the way in which the Petrofac 
values are understood and applied across 
the Group. This remains on the agenda  
for 2018, to ensure the values – and the 
behaviours associated with them – are 
clearly understood and consistently  
applied every day alongside our focus  
on business performance. 
Of course, the market environment 
remained competitive with clear evidence 
of overcapacity. The Board was encouraged 
that we saw a strong recovery in new 
orders while, for those projects we did bid 
for, we maintained our bidding discipline. 
We secured more than US$5.2 billion in 
new orders and extensions in 2017 from 
both existing and adjacent markets.
Once again, our safety performance was 
most impressive, as further articulated in 
the Group Chief Executive’s statement and 
the Corporate Responsibility section of  
this report. Even so, there is no room for 
complacency and we must continue to 
retain our focus in this area.
Maintaining a strong Board for the future
The Board aspires to lead by example  
and live the Petrofac values: safe, ethical, 
innovative, responsive, quality and cost 
conscious, and driven to deliver.
It was a particularly busy year for the Board, 
and I want to thank all Directors for their 
individual contributions and determination  
to see the Group through this challenging 
period, whilst ensuring Petrofac continues  
to deliver for its stakeholders. 
The Board aims to have first-hand 
knowledge of the business, and our visit  
to Aberdeen in October reminded us of  
the pricing pressures we face whilst 
demonstrating the level of professional 
commitment across the Group. I also took 
the time to visit the Upper Zakum field 
development in the UAE and the Greater 
Stella Area development in the UK, whilst 
the full Board visited two of our Indian 
engineering offices in January 2017 .
There were some changes to the Board 
during the year, with the resignation of  
both Jane Sadowsky and Thomas Thune 
Andersen. Having led the Remuneration 
Committee since 2010, Thomas made a 
particularly strong contribution, for which  
I thank him. 
I am confident that the Group will, going 
forward, continue to benefit from a strong, 
diverse, multi-disciplinary Board, with a 
good ratio of Non-executive to Executive 
Directors. In particular, we look forward  
to working with Sara Akbar, who joined  
the Board in January. Sara’s in-depth 
knowledge of the Middle East’s oil and gas 
sector promises to be a strong asset. 
To ensure that the leadership team can 
deliver on these objectives, the Board has 
concluded that restrictions imposed on the 
Group Chief Executive in May 2017 are no 
longer appropriate. Ayman will resume full 
executive duties with immediate effect and 
re-join the Nominations Committee. He will 
continue to fully respect and support the 
process and independence of both the 
SFO investigation and the sub-committee 
of the Board with delegated responsibility 
for this matter.
Succession planning will remain a top 
priority. During 2017 we were reassured 
that there is a strong pipeline of talent 
coming through at all levels. In 2018  
we expect the business to take a more 
forensic approach to talent management.
After an 1 1-year tenure, I have decided to 
stand down from the Board, and would  
like to thank my fellow Directors for their 
support. I know that, with René Médori 
succeeding me, the Board will remain in 
safe hands. His wide international 
experience and understanding of growing 
multi-national businesses, the global 
landscape, well-established governance 
and regulatory knowledge, provides an 
important level of continuity. As a result of 
René’s change in role, Matthias Bichsel will 
assume the role of Senior Independent 
Director in May 2018.
Finally, I want to thank all our employees  
for their continued commitment during a 
challenging year, and throughout my tenure 
on the Board. In particular, I would like to 
pay tribute to our Group Chief Executive 
Ayman Asfari and the wider leadership 
team. It is encouraging to see how hard  
he and his executive team are working  
to deliver on our collective commitments,  
and position the Group for success over 
the longer term.

The long-term market  
fundamentals are robust
We believe that the long-term market 
fundamentals are robust – and Petrofac  
is well positioned to benefit.
Among industry analysts, such as the 
International Energy Agency (IEA) and  
the Organization of Petroleum Exporting 
Economies (OPEC), there is consensus  
that global energy demand is set to grow 
strongly over the long term, and that 
hydrocarbons will continue to play a 
significant role. 
The most recent analysis from the IEA 
estimates that energy demand is set to 
grow by almost 30% by 2040 (under the 
new policies scenario
1
), by which time the 
world’s energy supply mix will divide into 
four broadly equal parts: oil, gas, coal  
and low-carbon sources. This will see 
demand for oil growing by 1 1 million barrels 
a day, or 13%, to reach almost 105 million 
barrels a day
2
. Meanwhile, demand for  
gas is estimated to grow by some 45% to 
exceed 5,300 billion cubic metres per year
2
.
Large-scale investment in oil and gas 
infrastructure will be required to meet 
demand growth. The IEA anticipates 
cumulative investment in the oil and gas 
sector of US$21 trillion by 2040, which 
represents an annual investment of 
US$860 billion.
In its World Oil Outlook 2017 , OPEC reaches 
broadly similar conclusions, and asserts 
that: “OPEC Member Countries remain 
committed to supporting investments – in 
new upstream capacity, in the maintenance 
of existing fields and infrastructure, in the 
construction of the necessary pipelines, 
and in the building and expansion of oil 
terminals and refineries.” 
We therefore expect clients to continue  
to invest in long-term strategic projects, 
especially in regions with lower marginal 
costs of production such as the Middle 
East and North Africa (MENA) region.
Petrofac is well positioned  
in some of the most promising  
sectors of the market
Petrofac has an extensive track record in 
MENA, one of our core geographies. In its 
2017 ranking of MENA EPC contractors, 
MEED.com named Petrofac as one of  
the region’s top contractors. Meanwhile, 
Arabian Oil and Gas Magazine ranked us  
as one of the top two contractors. 
We expect the region’s resource holders to 
continue to invest over the short to medium 
term. Over the longer term, according to 
the IEA, meeting demand will depend 
increasingly on the larger resource-holders 
in the region. By 2040, for example, oil 
production from the OPEC members 
located in the Middle East is forecast to  
rise by more than 6 million barrels per day 
(up from 30.4 million barrels per day in 2015  
to 36.5 million barrels per day in 2040) 
2
. 
We also see a strong trend for investment  
in the downstream market in the MENA 
region, as resource holders look to 
industrialise their economies, create 
employment, and secure more of the  
value chain. 
We have seen a return to growth  
in upstream capital spending
After considerable declines in 2015 and 
2016, upstream capital spending is 
showing tentative signs of a recovery.
In 2017 , global upstream capital spending 
is estimated to have grown by around 9%
3
, 
further modest growth is forecast for 2018, 
and we expect a return to more significant 
increases over the medium to longer term. 
In the Middle East, the rebound is expected 
to be relatively strong, with increases of 
14%
3
 predicted for 2018. We are also well 
positioned in several other regions such  
as the CIS, Africa and Asia Pacific, where  
we already have a local presence, strong 
relationships and an extensive track record.
Petrofac is well positioned in some of the  
most resilient sectors of the market

We see good downstream 
opportunities – where Petrofac  
has been extending its credentials
In addition to our upstream activities, 
Petrofac is well placed to take advantage  
of downstream opportunities in the  
refining and petrochemicals sectors. 
Global refining capacity is expected to 
increase by some 14% 
3
 over the next four 
years, with significant activity in the Middle 
East, Africa and Asia. Similarly, the global 
petrochemicals market is poised for 
considerable growth, with compound 
annual growth rates of 4% over the next 
decade. An indication of the potential 
comes from Abu Dhabi where the Abu 
Dhabi National Oil Company (ADNOC) 
recently announced a five-year US$109 
billion capital expenditure plan, 40% of 
which will be directed to downstream 
investments, lifting the Emirate’s refining 
capacity by 60%.
Over recent years, Petrofac has built  
its credentials in the refining sector.  
We have secured several major projects 
and, in 2017 , were awarded a further 
contract worth approximately US$2 billion 
from Duqm Refinery and Petrochemical 
Industries LLC (in a 50/50 joint venture  
with Samsung Engineering). We are 
confident that we can achieve similar 
success in petrochemicals.
We have also been successful in moving 
into other adjacent sectors such as 
offshore wind. In 2017 , for example, we 
made good progress with the BorWin3  
and Galloper projects, and were awarded  
a floating wind turbine research project  
by the UK’s Carbon Trust.
We see a strengthening in upstream 
operating expenditure – with pockets 
of opportunity for Petrofac
In our reimbursable business, we have 
withstood significant recent decreases  
in upstream operating expenditures.  
In Europe the spending peak was reached 
back in 2013 and, in the Middle East it  
was in 2014, with subsequent falls driven 
by deflation in the supply chain and 
decreasing activity levels.
2017 saw some modest growth, amounting 
to 5%
3
 in the Middle East and a little over 
3%
3
 in Europe. Across the Middle East,  
we are confident of stronger increases in 
the coming years, but expect conditions in 
Europe to remain challenging. Nonetheless, 
we secured a number of contract extensions 
in 2017 and, with new operating models 
among operators, transfers of asset 
ownership, and increasing potential for  
late life and decommissioning services,  
we do see pockets of opportunity.
Tendering activity remains high,  
but competitive
While tendering activity within our core 
markets has remained high through 2017 
and into 2018, we are facing increased 
competition. Even so, by lowering our  
cost base and focusing on operational 
excellence, we have shown that we  
are able to compete effectively while 
maintaining our bidding discipline.

In the backdrop of a challenging 
2017 , Petrofac delivered a 
strong performance. 
Our clients demonstrated their confidence 
with both new and repeat business, we 
saw a recovery in new orders, progressed 
new organic growth opportunities, reduced 
capital intensity, delivered an impressive 
safety performance, and continued to 
deliver high standards of execution. 
As a result, the business is on the path to 
recovery and well-positioned for sustained 
long-term success. 
Clearly, Petrofac’s 2017 performance was 
overshadowed by the investigation by the 
UK Serious Fraud Office (SFO), which is 
covered elsewhere in this Annual Report. 
Nonetheless, I want to thank the Board,  
our employees, our clients, and our 
shareholders for their support during  
this challenging period. Together, we 
demonstrated the underlying resilience  
of the business and continued to make 
progress in delivering our strategy.
I would like to provide an update on our 
three strategic themes, the evolving market 
environment, and my priorities for 2018 
and beyond.

GROUP CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S REVIEW Delivering organic growth
We progressed organic growth 
opportunities in both complementary 
geographies and adjacent sectors.
For example, we are bidding actively –  
and executing projects – in India, South 
East Asia, Turkey and Russia, where we 
have a full understanding of the risks and 
the capacity to deliver, and can build on 
existing client relationships and/or draw on 
previous experience. Indicative successes 
include our first ever Turkish project, for a 
new €340 million gas receiving terminal, 
and a return to EPC work in Russia with  
the award of a US$700 million contract  
on Sakhalin Island by Sakhalin Energy 
Investment Company Ltd.
In terms of adjacent sectors, we continue 
to extend our downstream credentials.  
In recent years, we secured several  
major refinery projects and, in 2017 ,  
were awarded a US$2 billion contract  
from Duqm Refinery and Petrochemical 
Industries LLC where we are a 50/50  
joint venture partner with Samsung 
Engineering. We are confident that, by 
replicating this approach, we can achieve 
similar success in downstream markets, 
such as petrochemicals, and win a share  
of the substantial capital investments that 
are planned in this sector.
We have also had some success in 
offshore wind. In 2017 , we made progress 
with the BorWin3 and Galloper projects, 
and were awarded a floating wind turbine 
research project by the UK’s Carbon Trust.
Reducing capital intensity
We made significant progress in reducing 
the capital intensity of the business.
We have concluded the sale of our interest 
in the Pánuco field in Mexico and have 
converted Santuario, the largest of our 
three remaining Mexican service contracts, 
into a Production Sharing Contract, where we 
have ownership of the underlying reserves. 
We have also driven further significant 
reductions in capital spending, and are 
bringing increased visibility to our cash 
management. Going forward, we expect  
to continue to divest non-core assets,  
but will be measured in our approach,  
in a way that protects shareholder value.
The Board has confirmed its intention  
to exit the deep-water market and the 
JSD6000 installation vessel has been 
reclassified as an asset held for sale.
A reassuring new order intake, 
providing good revenue visibility
I regard our 2017 new order intake of 
US$5.2 billion as a good outcome in a 
challenging environment, giving us a healthy 
order book and good revenue visibility.
Tendering activity remains high and we 
continue to maintain our bidding discipline 
to protect our margins in a competitive 
market. Upstream, there is the beginning  
of a recovery in capital spending plans and, 
downstream, we see a flow of opportunities 
and strong political will in several countries 
to expand capacity and play a wider role  
in the hydrocarbons value chain. 
In the UK, conditions remain difficult. 
Contract extensions for Chevron and BP 
were welcome and our Memorandum  
of Understanding with Danos in the US 
demonstrates our determination to pursue 
selected opportunities in those markets 
which we consider to be attractive and 
have knowledge of.
Focusing on our core 
Operational excellence continues to be  
a key theme for Petrofac and, in 2017 ,  
we continued our focus on best-in-class 
project delivery. This was achieved  
in tandem with an excellent safety 
performance which saw us outperform 
industry averages and receive several 
safety accolades from clients. 
We completed more than 239 million 
man-hours across the Group, handing  
over several projects to our clients. A good 
example is the Khazzan project for BP  
in Oman, where we celebrated first gas  
on Phase 1, extended an exemplary site 
safety record beyond 43 million man-hours, 
and secured a US$800 million contract  
for Phase 2.
A highlight in our EPS East business was 
the securement of a 10-year Framework 
Agreement for Petroleum Development 
Oman (PDO). While the market remains 
challenging for the EPS West business, 
ongoing consolidation in our sector is 
expected to bring new opportunities.
By building on our existing strengths,  
we are able to deepen our competitive 
position and deliver more value to clients. 
During 2017 , we continued to reduce  
our cost base whilst maintaining our 
delivery capability. 
I should stress that this approach to 
incremental improvement extends well 
beyond our operational capability: our 
environmental management systems were 
further refined, we brought more discipline 
to the way we manage and develop our 
people, and we continued to further 
develop and highlight our compliance 
agenda throughout the organisation.
Meanwhile, the events of 2017 forced  
a refresh of the senior leadership teams, 
with several internal promotions and a  
few external appointments, including John 
Pearson as Chief Corporate Development 
Officer and Group Managing Director, 
Western Hemisphere. This demonstrated 
the strength of our succession planning  
as well as our ability to attract external 
candidates of the very highest calibre –  
all without missing a beat in our delivery.

 Design  Build
The Khazzan gas field is a 
significant strategic asset for 
BP and also for the Sultanate 
of Oman.
Petrofac’s involvement dates 
back to 2014, when we were 
awarded the engineering, 
procurement, construction 
and commissioning (EPCC) 
contract valued at over US$1 
billion for Phase 1 of the field’s 
central processing facility. 
A particular challenge was  
the tight timescales, which  
put significant demands on 
our technical teams and 
entailed a total of almost 
43 million man-hours. 
First gas was delivered in 
August 2017 . The project was 
executed safely, on time and 
on budget, and the creation  
of In-Country Value was a 
guiding principle throughout.
We were then awarded a 
lump-sum EPCC contract, 
worth around US$800 million, 
for Phase 2 of the project.  
This speaks for our record  
for project execution. It also 
enables us to continue the 
relationship with BP and  
build on our considerable 
experience in the Sultanate.

GROUP CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S REVIEW
CONTINUED Solid foundations for  
long-term recovery
Although the short-to-medium-term 
conditions remain challenging, we do 
anticipate healthy increased long-term 
demand for energy. Signs of healthy 
recovery, coupled with robust global 
growth forecasts for the next few years,  
are fuelling a growing appetite for 
hydrocarbons and ongoing capital 
spending by resource holders, which 
Petrofac is well placed to capitalise on. 
The operational performance of 2017 , 
backed up by our delivery-focused  
culture, our commitment to continuous 
improvement, and our excellent client 
relationships, demonstrate that Petrofac  
is well positioned to succeed as the  
market continues to show encouraging 
signs of improvement. 
Ayman Asfari
Group Chief Executive

Continuing to re-shape  
the IES business
A key objective of the year was to continue 
to deliver value from the IES portfolio and 
position the business as a route to our 
wider services.
Besides the Pánuco divestment,  
progress included the migration of our first 
Production Enhancement Contract (PEC)  
to a Production Sharing Contract (PSC), 
which constitutes the first such migration in 
Mexico and a pathway for our remaining two 
PECs. Meanwhile production commenced 
from the Greater Stella Area development 
in February, resumed in Tunisia in May, 
following extensive shut-ins due to  
civil unrest, and continued in line with 
expectations, albeit slightly lower on  
the previous year, in Malaysia. 
Priorities for 2018
For 2018, you can expect us to continue to 
pursue faithfully our three strategic themes: 
focusing on our core, delivering organic 
growth in those markets and sectors that 
we know and where we can manage the 
execution risk very effectively, and reducing 
capital intensity.
A personal priority for 2018 is to pay even 
closer attention to the way we manage  
and develop our employees and plan  
our long-term succession. Ultimately it is 
our people who are the key to Petrofac’s 
distinctive, delivery-focused culture,  
and 2017 was the ultimate test. In the  
face of considerable pressure, our 12,500 
people stepped up, worked hard, and 
demonstrated a remarkable level of 
commitment and loyalty to the Company, 
and for that I would like to reiterate my 
profound thanks.
2018 is also bringing some changes to our 
Board. After 1 1 years’ service, including 
three-and-a-half as Chairman, Rijnhard  
van Tets is stepping down and I would  
like to thank him for his clear sense of  
duty and support of the leadership team. 
Similarly, I pay tribute to Thomas Thune 
Andersen, who stepped down at the end 
of 2017 , thank him for many years of wise 
counsel, and wish him well for the future.

Strategic report
Petrofac Annual report and accounts 2017 / 25 Identifying and managing risks and 
opportunities is key to the successful delivery 
of our strategy. We operate in a challenging 
environment and understand that risks are 
an inherent part of our business. 
We believe our risk management framework 
provides us with the structure to identify  
the risks and uncertainties that may impact 
our business, thereby underpinning our 
ability to achieve our objectives and assess 
opportunities as our business evolves.
In 2017 , there was a particular focus on 
strengthening the Group’s compliance 
framework, in particular the anti-bribery 
and corruption controls that are in place 
across the Group. 
Risk governance
Petrofac’s overall system of risk governance 
centres on a number of committees and 
management processes, which bring 
together reports on the management  
of risk at various levels.
The risk governance process is supported 
by regular risk assessments and reviews  
of existing and new opportunities, by 
considering the risk exposure and risk 
appetite of each division, service line and 
function. The diagram on the left sets out 
the risk governance structure in operation, 
showing the interaction between the various 
risk review and management committees. 
The Group Risk Committee (GRC) is 
responsible for the assurance of the 
Enterprise Risk Management Framework 
agreed by the Board, including the 
recommendation of Group policies  
and the application of the Group’s 
Delegated Authorities. 
The GRC reviews all material new business 
opportunities and projects (including bid 
submissions, new country entries, joint 
ventures, investments, acquisitions and 
disposals) and is responsible for providing 
direction as to the management and 
mitigation of risk exposure. No proposal  
is presented to the GRC without first  
being reviewed and supported at the 
divisional level.
In addition to the Group’s regular risk 
review meetings, the Executive Committee 
increased the frequency of their meetings 
during 2017 . Safety, compliance, operational, 
commercial and finance matters are now

discussed weekly, with any emerging risks 
and opportunities being identified and 
addressed as appropriate. 
As with all aspects of good governance, 
the effectiveness of risk management  
and internal control also depends on  
the individuals responsible for operating  
the systems that are put in place.
Risk management framework
The Group’s risk management framework 
is designed to underpin the Group’s 
longer-term sustainability. It is based on  
the principles and guidelines of BS ISO 
31000/2009 and encompasses the 
policies, culture, organisation, behaviours, 
processes, systems (and other aspects  
of the Group) that, taken together, facilitate 
its effective and efficient operation.  
The framework supports the Board in 
exercising its overall responsibilities and to:
• Regulate the entry of appropriate 
opportunities and risks into the Group
• Develop our understanding of the most 
significant threats and opportunities
• Promote active management of risk 
exposures down to acceptable levels
• Assist the Group in delivering business plan 
objectives and operational performance
During 2017 , the framework continued to 
mature and we have produced detailed 
guidance to support its application to 
ensure it is followed consistently across 
the business. 
Risk appetite
The Group’s risk appetite is largely governed 
through the Delegated Authorities and Risk 
Review Committees, that are embedded 
across the Group. Risk appetite is managed 
through a series of limits and parameters, 
which are regularly monitored in each 
business service line and aggregated  
for review at Group level.
One of our intentions in 2017 was to assess 
the risk appetite for each of the Group’s 
principal risks. This remains on the agenda 
and the Board will undertake this exercise 
during 2018. 
2017 review
During the year we continued to enhance 
our processes and controls to improve both 
the consistency and transparency of our 
approach to risk management. The following 
improvements were made:
• The Compliance and Ethics Committee 
was formed
• The Third Party Risk Committee  
was established
• Development of a compliance charter
• Review and enhancement of existing 
policies and processes
• Enhancement of our compliance e-learning 
programme to further promote our key 
compliance requirements
• Revision of the Group’s organisational 
structure, with changes designed to 
provide clear accountability, drive growth 
and maintain our focus on execution and 
improve oversight and control within 
the business
• We carried out significant work on 
succession planning and talent 
development
• We added further controls to our Group 
risk reviews and increased the attendees to 
ensure we have cross-management input
• We continued to implement findings  
from lessons learned reviews, and we 
conducted regular ‘cold eye reviews’ 
across our E&C projects to support  
them in identifying additional risks and 
mitigating potential impacts
• We continued to develop and expand our 
‘stage gate’ approach to our E&C projects 
with additional improvements introduced 
through project controls and operational 
processes becoming more systematic
• We reviewed our Group functional risks 
and we have captured these within our 
risk reporting system
• Internal audit completed its transformation 
programme with a number of second  
line of defence assurance reviews, 
embedding a risk-based approach 
throughout the Group
• We launched a controls improvement 
programme, a broad-reaching initiative  
to improve our financial controls and 
provide enhanced assurance. It is 
building on existing best practices  
and will improve the way we work
RISK MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK
Strategic report
Petrofac Annual report and accounts 2017 / 27 • We continued to expand our intrusion 
detection monitoring of cyber-security 
threats and tighten our controls 
• A number of HSSEIA deep dives were 
conducted across the business to identify 
and address key related concerns
• There has been a continued focus on 
evacuation and emergency response 
with mock exercises regularly planned 
and conducted
• A number of new HSSEIA standards 
have been published and a driving safety 
policy video was circulated globally
Principal risks
The Board defines principal risks as those 
risks that, given the Group’s current position, 
could materially threaten the business 
model, future performance, prospects, 
solvency, liquidity, reputation, or prevent  
us from delivering our strategic objectives. 
The Key Risk Register (KRR) is the means by 
which the Group’s principal risks are reported 
to the Audit Committee and the Board for 
review. It includes business, compliance, 
financial, hazard and operational risks, 
together with external factors over which  
the Group may have little or no direct control, 
such as market conditions and worsening 
political risks in key geographies. The GRC 
reviews the KRR quarterly prior to submission 
to the Audit Committee. 
The KRR is designed to provide the Board 
and Audit Committee with clarity around the 
Group’s principal risks and uncertainties, 
ownership, accountability and mitigation 
strategies, to promote active engagement, 
informed debate and constructive 
challenge, and to keep under review the 
effectiveness of decision making processes.
As reported on page 78 in the Annual 
Report, the Serious Fraud Office (SFO) 
began a formal investigation in May 2017 . 
We have also considered the potential 
impact of the EU referendum result and  
the triggering of Article 50 in March 2017 . 
The Board believes that as an international 
Group, we have little exposure to the 
European continent and do not expect that 
the United Kingdom leaving the EU would 
have any significant impact on our business.
The Board regularly reviews the funding 
position of the Group, its projected 
liquidity requirements and factors that 
could adversely affect the Group’s future 
long-term viability. In doing so Directors 
assess the prospects of the Group by 
reference to its current financial and 
operational position, its recent and 
historical financial performance, its future 
financial plans and the potential impact  
of the principal risks and mitigating  
factors described on pages 30 to 33. 
The Directors have assessed the viability 
of the Group over a three-year period to 
31 December 2020. The Board believes 
that this is an appropriate time horizon 
given its business portfolio, order backlog 
and business development pipeline  
offers limited visibility beyond three years. 
The Board reviews its prospects over  
a longer term horizon and prepares a 
five-year business plan that is dependent 
on the external market environment, 
securing new orders at sustainable 
margins, operational performance and 
capital discipline. The Group’s business 
model aims to deliver sustainable, 
long-term value to shareholders through 
dividend payments and financial returns 
from share price growth.
The Directors considered the following 
principal risks as the most important  
in their assessment of the viability of  
the Group:
• Market conditions
• Worsening political risks in  
key geographies
• Failure to meet projected order targets 
• Operational and project performance
• Loss of licence to operate
• Loss of financial capacity
The Group’s business plan forecasts have 
been stress tested against a number of 
severe but plausible risks to the business 
that could potentially impact the Group’s 
ability to fund its future activities and 
adhere to its banking covenants:
• A material decline in oil price relative 
to both our and market expectations
• A substantial reduction in forecast new 
orders in Engineering & Construction
• A material financial loss resulting 
from poor execution of a major 
lump-sum project 
• A significant decline in the operating 
and financial performance of 
Engineering & Production Services
• An increase in working capital driven  
by a deterioration in contractual terms, 
weak cash management or delays  
in commercial settlements
• Adverse commercial settlements 
resulting in a significant financial loss
In considering the impact of these 
stress-test scenarios, the Board has 
reviewed realistic mitigating actions that 
could be taken to avoid or reduce the 
impact or occurrence of the underlying 
risks. These include reducing operating 
expenditure, cutting discretionary capital 
expenditure, lowering dividends and 
disposing of non-core assets. 
The Board has also reviewed and 
approved the Group’s funding plan, 
long-term liquidity forecasts and risk 
management policies, which monitor and 
mitigate the risk of a change in our financial 
position. In certain scenarios, we may 
need to access capital markets to raise 
additional funds to supplement cash flow 
from operations or to provide additional 
liquidity headroom. The Group has an 
established track record of successfully 
raising capital from a diverse range of 
sources and the Directors believe the 
Group should continue to have access to 
capital markets at commercially acceptable 
rates throughout the assessment period. 
Whilst the principal risks all have the 
potential to affect future performance, 
none of them are considered likely either 
individually or collectively to threaten  
the viability of the business over the 
assessment period. Based on the results 
of this detailed assessment, the Directors 
have a reasonable expectation that  
the Group will be able to continue in 
operation and meet its liabilities as they 
fall due over the next three years.
VIABILITY STATEMENT
28 / Petrofac Annual report and accounts 2017
RISK MANAGEMENT 
CONTINUED Principal risks are those risks that, given the Group’s current position, 
could materially threaten the business model, future performance, 
prospects, solvency, liquidity, reputation, or prevent us from delivering 
our strategic objectives. 
In terms of managing these risks, our systems of risk management and internal control are founded upon deployment of our Enterprise 
Risk Management Framework (based upon ISO 31000:2009); and our Internal Control Framework. Details of these are included in the 
Audit Committee report on pages 82 to 87 .
MARKET CONDITIONS
Description and impact 
Low oil and gas prices impact the capital 
expenditure plans of our key clients and  
the demand for our services, limiting our 
profitability and growth. Over the longer 
term, volatility in oil and gas prices could 
influence and change the industry’s 
business models and investment trends. 
The financial performance of IES is directly 
impacted by oil and gas price volatility.
Mitigation and management
The oil and gas market is showing signs of improvement. Oil prices have improved and the majority  
of forecasts expect a rise in price in the medium term. We expect clients in our core markets will 
continue to invest in long-term strategic projects, especially regions with lower costs of production. 
New investment decisions are now being taken and capital investment is edging upwards. 
We achieved US$5.2 billion of new order intake, providing us with good revenue visibility and we 
continue to see high levels of tendering activity. 
We are pushing forward with organic growth initiatives. During 2017, we established E&C Growth  
and we plan to grow our EPS business through the expansion of existing services, new geographies 
and EPCm opportunities. 
We have maintained strong relationships with our clients over the recent downturn, working with 
them to ensure we have strong commercial and contract management on our projects. We continue 
to focus on operational excellence to remain competitive.
Significant movements in exchange rates 
could impact our financial performance. 
The majority of Group revenues are denominated in US dollars or currencies pegged to the US dollar. 
Where we procure equipment or incur costs in other currencies, we use forward currency contracts 
to hedge any related exposure. 
Links
For more information see: pages 8-9;  
and 161
Change
We expect the 2018 market environment to remain broadly similar to 2017. It will 
continue to be competitive and bidding discipline will continue to be important. 
We will continue our focus on organic growth initiatives and we will maintain our 
cost competitiveness through our focus on operational excellence.
Assessment
  The risk has 
decreased  
in 2017
WORSENING POLITICAL RISKS IN KEY GEOGRAPHIES
Description and impact 
The Group’s backlog is heavily concentrated 
on business activities in the Middle East 
which may increase our vulnerability.  
Recent global economic conditions have  
had a significant impact on countries whose 
economies are exposed to the downturn  
in commodities, placing greater pressure  
on governments to find alternative means  
of raising revenues and increasing the risk  
of social and labour unrest. 
The impacts include risks to the successful 
delivery of our operations and associated 
impact on margins, the safety of our 
people, security issues, material logistics 
and travel restrictions. 
Mitigation and management
The Board actively monitors political developments and seek to avoid or minimise our exposure  
to jurisdictions with unacceptable risk levels. 
We have good experience in project execution and maintain positive relationships with key 
stakeholders. Careful consideration is given to contractual terms and security conditions through  
our detailed risk review process and we seek external advice on specialist issues as required. 
The delivery model is modified to suit each project and we limit exposure to single sources of supply 
and service. We limit our fixed asset commitment within each contract and closely monitor and 
manage our cash flow and commitments. There is continued focus on evacuation and emergency 
response and operations are assessed and executed in accordance with our security policy and 
security standards. 
The risk of over-concentration in a 
particular market or geography.
We are actively pursuing projects in new geographies and we carry out detailed risk analysis before 
entering any new country. 
Links
For more information see: pages 19; 46-50; 
and 58-59
Change
To mitigate the risk of geographical concentration, a new business line to focus 
on growth of lump-sum business into new geographies has been established. 
Dedicated leadership and resources have been assigned to identify opportunities 
and assess the risks and mitigations for business delivery.

Strategic report
Petrofac Annual report and accounts 2017 / 29
PRINCIPAL RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES FAILURE TO MEET PROJECTED ORDER INTAKE
Description and impact 
The risk is that our clients continue to 
exercise capital discipline and the demand 
for our services may be impacted with  
the cancellation or delay of planned 
investments. The potential impact is  
that the Group could fail to deliver its 
anticipated backlog and growth targets.
Mitigation and management
In our MENA region, the source of the majority of our backlog, we see a good pipeline of bidding 
opportunities in 2018 and 2019. New investment decisions are now being taken and capital 
investment is edging upwards. 
We saw a strong recovery in new orders in 2017, including projects in adjacent markets such as 
Russia and Turkey. We are also reviewing a number of potential opportunities in India as we seek  
to further expand our geographic footprint. 
The Group wins most of its work  
through a competitive bidding process,  
and as competition increases, there is  
a risk that we could fail to maintain 
differentiated margins. 
Our service lines work together to review and identify prospects and regularly analyse bid-to-win 
ratios and our competition. We expect the market for our services to remain very competitive and 
continue our focus on operational excellence to support our competitive bidding performance by 
protecting, and where possible, enhancing margins. We have dedicated resources to support clients’ 
financing requirements in our bids. 
We have been able to further reduce our project support costs in 2017. These savings allow us  
to be more competitive in the market, deliver projects for our clients more cost-effectively and help  
to support our margins going forward.

For more information see: pages 8-9 
Change
During 2017 we saw a strong recovery in new orders and we have a healthy 
bidding pipeline for 2018 and 2019. 
Assessment

in 2017
DELIVERING OUR STRATEGY
Description and impact 
To build enterprise value, we need to 
assure shareholders and opinion formers 
that we are pursuing an appropriate 
strategy capable of delivering shareholder 
value. The impact is reflected in the 
appetite for new investors to buy into  
the Group and consequently our  
relative valuation multiple. 
Mitigation and management
The challenging events of 2017 demonstrated our underlying resilience. We executed our projects 
effectively, reduced our debt and maintained our bidding discipline. We saw a strong recovery in  
new orders, securing US$5.2 billion in new order intake from both existing and adjacent markets. 
Developing opportunities for organic growth is a strategic priority and recognising the importance  
of this, we established a new service line in June to focus on E&C growth in new geographies.  
We are also planning to grow our reimbursable business in the western hemisphere through 
geographic and service line expansion, and we are exploring longer-term opportunities. 
The Board regularly assesses our strategic plan to satisfy itself that the right mix of risk, capability 
and reward is established. We conduct detailed sensitivity analysis to assess the robustness of our 
plans. The GRC reviews all material new business opportunities and projects, new country entries, 
joint ventures, investments, acquisitions and disposals. 
The Group may be unable to complete its 
divestment programme within the desired 
timescales or achieve the expected values. 
We are committed to a capital light business model going forward, we will continue to focus on 
strong cash management across the Group, and we will release capital from investments which  
are not strongly linked to our core competence. 
Links
For more information see: pages 6-11;  
and 14-21
Change
Our approach will continue to be characterised by three themes: focus on our 
core, organic growth and reduce capital intensity. 
Assessment
  The risk has 
decreased  
in 2017
OPERATIONAL AND PROJECT PERFORMANCE
Description and impact 
Our portfolio typically includes a relatively 
small number of large value contracts.  
Cost or schedule overruns on any of  
these projects could negatively impact  
the Group’s profitability, cash flows and 
relationships with key stakeholders. 
Mitigation and management
The main project risks are the application of contractual liquidated damages by clients and failure  
to secure assessed variation orders. We regularly review these exposures and are satisfied that the 
risks are balanced across the E&C portfolio. We work closely with our clients to resolve contractual 
elements for our substantially completed and ongoing projects. 
Key risks to delivery are initially identified at the tender stage, through the risk review process.  
On award, detailed execution strategies are further developed and during the execution phase, 
emerging risks and opportunities are managed through assurance and operational reviews.

PRINCIPAL RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES 
CONTINUED OPERATIONAL AND PROJECT PERFORMANCE continued
If we are unable to transfer certain risks to 
the insurance market (due to the availability 
or cost of cover, for example), we could be 
exposed to material uninsured losses.
We maintain a Group-wide insurance programme to mitigate against certain significant losses.  
The programme is consistent with general industry practice. We continually review the coverage  
of our policies.

We continued to operate effectively throughout 2017. Project delivery remained a 
significant area of focus for the Board and executive management to ensure that 
we continued to implement lessons learned from prior projects.

LOSS OF LICENCE TO OPERATE 
Description and impact 
Formal investigations by regulatory 
authorities could result in a loss in share 
price value and/or a loss in business.  
Other consequences could include  
the prosecution of the Company and  
of individuals; imprisonment and/or fines  
for individuals; and fines, penalties or other 
consequences, including reputational 
damage, to the Group. There may also  
be considerable cost and ongoing 
disruption in responding to allegations or 
investigations and taking remedial action.
Mitigation and management
A sub-committee of the Board has been established to be solely responsible for the Company’s 
engagement with the SFO and to oversee the Company’s response to their investigation. 
The investigation by the Serious Fraud Office (SFO) into Petrofac is ongoing. The Company continues 
to engage with the SFO and is devoting significant resources to this matter. It is unclear when or  
how the investigation will be concluded. The consequences of this investigation will be determined  
by the regulatory authorities and it remains therefore too early for Petrofac to predict their outcome. 
Since the instigation of the investigation, shareholder confidence has been impacted resulting in  
a material fall in the market value. However, the award of new business has demonstrated that it  
is a ‘business as usual’ approach and that our clients remain supportive. 
There are several factors that could impact 
our ability to operate safely, ethically and 
effectively. These include safety and asset 
integrity risks and extend to a range of 
environmental and regulatory risks. The risk 
is the potential harm to our people, and the 
commercial and/or reputational damage 
that could be caused. 
Safety is a core value and the risk is governed largely by our operating framework, Group policies, 
systems and various monthly forums (such as the asset integrity review board). During the year we 
carried out a number of safety deep dives and introduced a number of global standards for HSSEIA. 
We continued our focus on crisis management training with exercises being held at the Group and 
project levels. We reviewed our business continuity plans and digital media response.
Ethical risks are covered under compliance and controls.

IT RESILIENCE
Description and impact 
The Group’s performance is increasingly 
dependent on the ongoing capability and 
reliability of our IT platforms. 
We (as with all companies) continue to be 
exposed to external cyber-security threats. 
Mitigation and management
Breach or failure of our IT systems due to integrity failings, negligence or attacks on cyber-security 
could seriously disrupt our operations and could result in the loss or misuse of sensitive information. 
Such breaches in IT security could adversely impact the Group’s ability to operate and lead to 
financial loss, damaged reputation, loss of client and shareholder confidence and regulatory fines. 
We have adopted a ‘cloud’ strategy and increasingly use secure internet connectivity. We have  
a number of intrusion detection and prevention tools so we can quickly respond to alerts and 
suspicious activity. We have moved to a greater standardisation of our IT systems in an effort to 
replace our legacy systems.
The Group recognises the increased incidence of cyber-security threats and has recently reviewed its 
policies, procedures and defences to mitigate associated risks, engaging market-leading specialists 
where appropriate.

Petrofac Annual report and accounts 2017 / 31 LOSS OF FINANCIAL CAPACITY
Description and impact 
Failure to adequately forecast, manage or 
maintain sufficient liquidity and credit could 
impact our ability to operate and result in 
financial loss and/or ability to comply with 
our financial covenants.
Mitigation and management
We always maintain an adequate level of liquidity in the form of readily available cash, short-term 
investments, or committed credit facilities. The Audit Committee has defined a minimum level of 
liquidity that must be maintained.
Debt costs may arise owing to rating 
agency downgrades and the possibility  
of restricted access to funding. 
A funding plan was approved by the Board in February and November 2017 to employ a  
conservative and flexible funding strategy, robust across a range of business plan scenarios.  
We made good progress in 2017, securing an extension of our revolving credit facilities and 
refinancing US$300 million of term-loan maturities. 
Access to multiple sources of funding is 
critical to our sustainability and future growth. 
Failure to obtain financing could hamper the 
Group’s growth, prevent us from taking on 
new projects and could adversely affect  
the Group’s financial performance.
We prepare quarterly cash flow forecasts, aligned to our financial reforecasts, to identify any  
funding requirements well in advance. 
We introduced a global cash management tool and increased our focus on working capital 
management during 2017. 
The risk of financial or commercial 
exposure if counterparties (such as key 
financial institutions, clients, partners, 
subcontractors or vendors) default  
on their commitments.
We perform financial due diligence on new and existing clients. We closely monitor all receivables 
and seek to minimise the risk of exposure through contractual terms. We have regular, senior level 
dialogue with our major clients to understand and pre-empt any concerns that they may have. 
Bank ratings are monitored to ensure security of counterparty for both deposits and lending.  
The risk is managed by Group Treasury and the Audit Committee.

DILUTION OF COMPANY CULTURE AND/OR CAPABILITY
Description and impact 
An inability to respond quickly and 
effectively to unplanned changes in  
the leadership structure could have an 
adverse impact on the delivery of our 
strategy and day-to-day operations.
Mitigation and management
The Group’s organisational structure was revised in May 2017. The changes were designed to 
provide clear accountability, drive growth and maintain focus on execution, and improve oversight 
and control within the business. 
The focus on succession planning remains an important priority for the Board and we continue  
to review and update succession plans for all our critical roles across the top three tiers of the 
organisation. The overall senior talent pipeline is reviewed on a quarterly basis.
We are developing a cadre of future leaders and providing them with the opportunities to 
demonstrate their potential and accelerate their progression. We have identified our high performing 
employees who we see as having the potential to be longer-term successors; and we also focus on 
the emerging talent who are viewed as high potential individuals and we manage their development 
in terms of on the job training, rotations and training events to accelerate their progression. Over 50%  
of graduates hired since 2004 have been retained within the Group. 
Our aim is to always place our most effective people into our most important roles.
Failure to attract and retain the right level  
of skilled and experienced personnel  
could negatively impact our distinctive, 
delivery-focused culture, and prevent  
us from maintaining our operational 
capability and relationships with clients.
We review future headcount requirements as part of our planning process to assess whether  
to reduce our overall headcount in response to tighter market conditions or to invest in retaining 
capability. Five-year capability plans have been collated across the Group, linked to the annual 
business plan process. 
A new integrated learning management system was launched in 2017 to capture individual 
performance objectives and is being used to support mandatory employee performance reviews. 
We remain confident that our policies to attract, retain, train, promote and reward our people are 
appropriate for the Group – and will enable us to meet our strategic goals.

PRINCIPAL RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES 
CONTINUED COMPLIANCE AND CONTROLS
Description and impact
The management of agency relationships 
represents one of the largest risks of 
reputational damage that companies face. 
Mitigation and management
A Third Party Risk Committee was established during 2017 to review all high risk relationships and 
further progress was made to develop the compliance-related internal controls framework.
The potential financial and reputational  
risk that would arise from failure to  
comply with law and regulation and/or 
non-conformance with relevant Group 
standards, policies and procedures.
The Code of Conduct sets out the behaviours expected of our employees and those people  
who work with us. Our employees at supervisory level and above are required to complete an annual 
mandatory declaration to confirm they have complied with the Code of Conduct, have declared  
any actual or potential breach of our Code and any potential conflict of interest. Our Group Finance 
function launched a controls improvement programme during the year to enhance the financial 
controls framework. 
The Group faces risks associated with the 
management of trade sanctions as it 
develops business in Russia. 
The Group must ensure a broad understanding of, and compliance with, the sanctions regime.  
As part of the risk review process, sanctions implications are reviewed with the business and 
specialised external counsel before entering any territory that may be impacted.

ENGINEERING & 
CONSTRUCTION (E&C)
The Engineering & Construction (E&C) division 
delivers onshore and offshore engineering, 
procurement, construction, installation and 
commissioning services on a lump-sum basis.  
We have more than 35 years of expertise in  
this area and our services encompass both  
greenfield and brownfield developments.
We delivered good progress across our 
portfolio of lump-sum engineering and 
construction projects during the year.  
On our upstream projects, we completed 
the Khazzan central processing facility in 
Oman. We also commissioned the In Salah 
southern fields development, introduced 
gas into the Reggane North Development 
plant and were ready for the introduction  
of gas into the Alrar gas plant, all in Algeria. 
Several other projects are now in the 
pre-commissioning or commissioning 
phase. On our downstream projects, the 
Sohar refinery in Oman is in commercial 
operation, the Petro Rabigh and Jazan 
south tank farm projects in Saudi Arabia 
are in the commissioning phase, and 
pre-commissioning activities have started 
on the KNPC Clean Fuels Project in Kuwait.
New awards
New order intake for the year totalled 
US$4. 1 billion, including:
Gathering Centre 32 (GC 32), Kuwait
In March, we secured a lump-sum 
engineering, procurement and construction 
(EPC) project with Kuwait Oil Company, 
valued at approximately US$1.3 billion,  
for the first oil and gas sour gathering 
centre to be developed in the Burgan oil 
field. The scope of work for GC 32 includes 
greenfield activities with tie-in works to 
existing brownfield infrastructure, and  
will have the capacity to produce around 
120,000 barrels of oil per day together with 
associated water, gas and condensate. 
Work is scheduled to be completed in 
mid-2020.
Duqm refinery, Oman
In September, in a 50/50 joint venture with 
Samsung Engineering, Petrofac received 
notification of intent to award a contract 
worth approximately US$2 billion with 
Duqm Refinery and Petrochemical 
Industries LLC (DRPIC). Work on the 
47-month project is expected to commence 
shortly, following formal contract signature 
on 15 February 2018. Petrofac’s and 
Samsung’s scope of work includes 
engineering, procurement, construction, 
commissioning, training and start-up 
operations for all the utilities and offsites.

As covered on page 56, the project  
is a good indication of our commitment  
to worker welfare and, despite the 
frequent downpours of tropical rain,  
the congested site has maintained an 
excellent safety record. 
As ever, local delivery has been a key 
consideration. Based on our knowledge 
of the domestic supply chain, Petrofac 
has chosen to work exclusively with 
locally-based subcontractors and has 
helped them to source, recruit and train  
a high proportion of Malaysian workers.
By the year-end, more than 90% of the 
construction work had been completed, 
and the focus of the project was 
beginning to shift to systems completion.

Contract value of EPCC project
 MALAYSIA
 Design  Build
The RAPID project in Malaysia is 
strategically significant in several respects.
Awarded by PRPC Refinery and Cracker 
Sdn Bhd (a subsidiary of PETRONAS), 
the US$500 million EPCC project is a 
perfect Petrofac example of organic growth.
As one of the first refinery projects  
to be secured by the Company, it  
builds our downstream credentials  
and demonstrates our ability to move  
into adjacent sectors.
It is also our first major onshore project  
in Malaysia, showing our ability to extend 
into complementary geographies, where 
we have a full understanding of the risks 
as well as the capacity to deliver.
Onshore processing facility, 
Sakhalin Island, Russia
In September, we were awarded a contract 
worth more than US$700 million by Sakhalin 
Energy Investment Company Ltd (Sakhalin 
Energy) for its onshore processing facility 
(OPF). The project comprises a lump-sum 
engineering, procurement and offshore 
fabrication component, as well as a 
reimbursable element for construction  
and site services. The scope of work 
includes inlet separation and feed gas 
compression facilities, a new flare system, 
utilities, substations and associated 
buildings, as well as brownfield tie-ins to 
the existing OPF. With early engineering 
work already underway, the project will 
support Sakhalin Energy in maintaining  
its export gas capacity.
Khazzan Phase 2 central  
processing facility, Oman
In December, we were awarded a  
lump-sum contract worth approximately 
US$800 million by BP for the Phase 2 
central processing facility (CPF) at the 
Khazzan Phase 2 gas development.  
This follows completion of the US$1.4 billion 
Phase 1 CPF Khazzan project in late 2017 . 
The project comprises the addition of a 
third gas train, which will help increase  
total production capacity from the CPF  
to 1,500 million standard cubic feet per  
day (mmscfd). The scope of work also 
includes liquid and compression trains  
and associated infrastructure, as well  
as brownfield work associated with 
connecting the Phase 1 and 2 facilities.

Results
Revenue for the year was down 19% from 
record levels in 2016 to US$4,801 million 
(2016: US$5,928 million) reflecting  
project phasing.
Business performance net profit for the 
year increased 10% to US$342 million 
(2016: US$31 1 million), reflecting lower 
revenue, but higher reported net margin. 
Net margin increased to 7 . 1% (2016: 5.2%), 
with an improvement in project mix partly 
offset by higher deferred tax. The net 
margin in 2016 was impacted by the  
final commercial settlement on the 
Laggan-Tormore project.
Exceptional items and certain re-
measurements in the Engineering & 
Construction division totalled US$155 
million after tax (2016: US$35 million;  
see note 5 to the consolidated financial 
statements), predominantly due to an 
impairment charge of US$176 million 
(post-tax) in relation to the JSD6000 
installation vessel which has been 
reclassified as an asset held for sale 
reflecting our intention to exit the  
deep-water market.
Engineering & Construction backlog stood 
at US$7 .5 billion at 31 December 2017

and front-end engineering and full project delivery 
as well as a range of operations, maintenance  
and engineering services for onshore and  
offshore projects.
Engineering & Production Services 
delivered solid operational performance  
in a challenging market environment. 
Continued good performance in our 
international operations and maintenance 
contracts and engineering, procurement 
and construction management (EPCm) 
projects largely offset lower new order 
intake, activity and utilisation in EPS West.
We secured awards and extensions worth 
approximately US$1. 1 billion during 2017 , 
predominantly in the UK, Iraq and Kuwait, 
as well as our first project in Turkey:
• Through the year, we secured several 
awards and extensions in the UK, 
including a three-year extension of a 
maintenance services contract with  
BP and a 12-month extension for 
engineering services with Chevron
• During the first quarter of 201 7 , we 
secured a series of contract awards worth 
more than US$70 million for engineering, 
operations and maintenance services  
in Iraq with two major International Oil 
Companies (IOCs) and South Oil Company 
(now Basra Oil Company (BOC))
• In June, we signed a five-year 
agreement, valued at more than US$35 
million, with Kuwait Oil Company for the 
provision of specialist technical training 
and competency development services
• In July, we secured a contract extension 
and a new award with a combined  
value of more than US$100 million for 
construction management, engineering, 
commissioning and start-up services  
for two IOCs in Iraq
• In September, we were awarded a 
contract valued at approximately  
€340 million, with South Stream 
Transport B.V., a wholly owned 
subsidiary of GAZPROM, for the 
development of onshore pipelines  
and a gas receiving terminal in Turkey
• In December, we secured a two-year

with BOC for its Iraq Crude Oil Export 
Expansion Project
In addition, in June 2017 , we signed  
a 10-year framework agreement with

integrated oilfield services provider, signed 
a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) to 
progress towards a joint venture agreement 
for the pursuit of opportunities to deliver 
services across the oil and gas asset life

will focus on supporting operations and 
asset management solutions.
Results
Revenue for the year decreased 19% to 
US$1,392 million (2016: US$1,725 million). 
The decrease was predominantly due to 
the phasing of EPCm projects and lower 
new order intake, activity and utilisation in 
EPS West.
Business performance net profit for the year 
was US$90 million (2016: US$1 1 1 million), 
reflecting the phasing of EPCm projects 
and lower activity, utilisation and order 
intake in EPS West. Net margin was stable 
at 6.5% (2016: 6.4%), with improved project 
profitability largely offset by lower overhead 
recovery and deferred tax charges.
Exceptional items and certain  
re-measurements in the Engineering  
& Production Services division totalled 
US$22 million after tax (2016: US$4 million; 
see note 5 to the consolidated financial 
statements), primarily in relation to an 
onerous leasehold property provision  
of US$12 million (post-tax) and office 
closure and redundancy costs of  
US$4m (post-tax).
Engineering & Productions Services backlog

And, in between, a growing range of 
services which combine the best of  
both approaches designed to align to

In our core Middle Eastern markets, 
clients often favour the lump-sum turnkey 
solution, but there are some who prefer 
more integration and control.

cash and deferred consideration is in line with the 
carrying amount.
In December, we completed the migration of the 
Santuario PEC into an interest in a PSC as part of  
the ongoing energy reforms in Mexico. With effect  
from 18 December 2017 , Petrofac owns a 36%  
equity interest in the PSC, with PEMEX Exploration  
& Production Mexico (PEMEX) having a 64% interest. 
The PSC will run for 25 years, with two optional 
five-year extensions. Petrofac will be the Operator  
of the block and will carry PEMEX’s share of cash  
calls for the first year. 
The Group earns a tariff per barrel on PECs for  
an agreed level of baseline production and an 
enhanced tariff per barrel on incremental production. 
During the year, the Group earned tariff income on  
a total of 4.8 million barrels of oil equivalent (mboe)  
(2016: 6.4 mboe). The 25% decrease in production 
reflects our exit from the Ticleni PEC during the second 
half of 2016 and the Pánuco PEC in August 2017 , and 
lower production from our remaining PECs in Mexico 
as we prepared for migration into equity contracts.
Equity Upstream Investments
The Greater Stella Area (GSA) development 
commenced production in February 2017 and  
we entered the licence in September 2017 .
Net entitlement production for the year from our  
equity upstream investments increased to 2.5 mboe 
(2016: 2. 1 mboe). The increase reflects GSA 
development licence entry and recommencement  
of production from the Chergui gas plant towards  
the end of May 2017 , after extensive shut-ins due to 
civil unrest. The increase was partly offset by lower 
production from Block PM304 in Malaysia, in line  
with expectations.
Risk Service Contract
We reached mutual agreement with PETRONAS  
in July 2016 for the cessation of the Berantai RSC, 
offshore Malaysia. As part of the agreement, the 
Berantai FPSO, which was held as an asset under 
finance lease, was transferred to PETRONAS during 
the second half of 2016.
Results
Revenue for the year decreased 16% to US$228 
million (2016: US$271 million). Excluding asset sales 
(our exit from the Berantai, Ticleni and Pánuco 
contracts), revenue was up 8%, reflecting GSA 
development start-up and licence entry and higher 
average realised hydrocarbon sales prices, partly  
offset by lower cost recovery in Mexico, reflecting 
lower investment.

Business performance net loss for the

US$42 million net loss), with lower revenue 
and higher taxes more than offset by lower 
operating costs, overheads, depreciation 
and finance costs.
Exceptional items and certain re-
measurements in the IES division totalled 
US$179 million after tax (2016: US$271 
million; see note 5 to the consolidated

relation to the Greater Stella Area 
development, following re-assessment  
of production profiles, including a lower  
oil to gas ratio, Block PM304, due to a

 MEXICO
 Manage & maintain
We took some big strides forward in 
Mexico in 2017 as we made progress  
on the repositioning of our portfolio  
of IES assets and unlocking value.
We have been operating in Mexico  
since 2012 through a series of  
Production Enhancement Contracts 
(PECs). Thanks to reinvestment in the  
fields and improved operational efficiency, 
our first two contracts, Magallanes and 
Santuario, soon increased their output  
by more than 50%. But, with the falling  
oil price and the prospect of Mexico’s 
energy reforms, everything changed.
Since then, our focus has been on working 
with our client PEMEX, our partners and 
Mexico’s regulators to migrate our PECs 
into equity Production Sharing Contracts 
(PSCs) – because, if we have a direct 
equity interest in the reserves, we get an 
increased incentive to develop the assets. 
The first major development came in 
August, with the sale of our 50% interest 
in the Pánuco PEC to Schlumberger,  
who already held the other 50%. It was 
recognised by both parties that a simplified 
ownership structure would best position 
the Pánuco PEC for migration.
Then, by December, we announced  
the migration of the Santuario PEC  
to a PSC, and we are now committed  
to unlocking value in the block through  
a new field development plan in 
conjunction with PEMEX.
The fact that this was the first contract 
migration in Mexican history meant that it 
had been a long and complex negotiation. 
However, with the precedent set, we are 
optimistic that it provides a model for the 
migration of our remaining PECs.

The Group delivered good 
operational performance  
in 2017 , underpinned by  
high levels of activity, good 
project execution and strong 
financial discipline. 
Revenue
Revenue for the year was US$6,395 million 
(2016: US$7 ,873 million), down 19% from 
record levels in 2016. Revenue in 
Engineering & Construction (E&C) declined 
19%, reflecting project phasing, while 
Engineering & Production Services (EPS) 
revenue declined 19% due to the phasing 
of EPCm projects and lower new order 
intake, activity and utilisation levels in EPS 
West. Integrated Energy Services’ (IES) 
revenue fell 16%, predominantly reflecting 
asset sales.
Backlog
The Group’s backlog decreased 13%  
to US$10.2 billion at 31 December 2017 
(31 December 2016 (restated): US$1 1.7 
billion), with progress delivered on the 
existing project portfolio more than 
offsetting US$5.2 billion of new order intake 
secured during 2017 . Reported backlog 
excludes the framework agreement signed 
with Petroleum Development Oman in 
June 2017 , which will add to backlog as 
projects are sanctioned. The Group no 
longer recognises backlog in respect of  
the IES division.

FINANCIAL REVIEW Earnings Before Interest, Tax, Depreciation  
and Amortisation (EBITDA)
Business performance EBITDA increased 4% to US$730 million 
(2016: US$704 million). EBITDA margin increased to 1 1.4%  
(2016: 8.9%). The increase in the EBITDA margin was due to:
• Project mix in E&C, including the final commercial settlement  
on the Laggan-Tormore project in the first half of 2016
• Business mix, including the phasing of EPCm projects, in EPS
• In IES, lower operating costs and overheads
Finance costs/income
Finance costs for the year declined 21% to US$80 million 
(2016: US$101 million) reflecting a reduction in finance lease 
interest cost following our exit from the Berantai RSC in 2016. 
Finance income for the year increased to US$10 million 
(2016: US$3 million) due to the unwinding of the discount  
on long-term receivables from customers.
Taxation
Business performance effective tax rate for the year ended 
31 December 2017 was 28.6% (2016: 20.3%). Included within  
the tax charge for the year is the deferred tax asset derecognition 
of US$38 million resulting from a combination of the previously 
announced changes in UK tax loss relief rules, which were 
enacted in October 2017 , and a reduction in UK profit forecasts.
A number of factors have increased the overall effective tax rate, 
with key drivers being changes in the recognition of tax losses  
and expenditure that is not deductible for tax purposes. In line with 
prior years, the effective tax rate is also driven by tax laws in the 
jurisdictions where the Group operates and generates profits.
Net profit
Business performance net profit increased 7% to US$343 million 
(2016: US$320 million). The reported net loss was US$29 million 
(2016: US$1 million net profit), reflecting an increase in exceptional 
items and certain re-measurements.
Group net margin increased to 5.4% (2016: 4. 1%), predominantly 
due to project mix in the E&C division, including the final 
commercial settlement on the Laggan-Tormore project in the  
first half of 2016, partly offset by higher tax.
Earnings per share
Business performance diluted earnings per share for the year  
was 100.9 cents per share (2016: 93.3 cents per share), reflecting 
the increase in business performance net profit. Total reported 
diluted earnings per share was a loss of 8.5 cents per share 
(2016: profit of 0.3 cents per share), reflecting an increase in 
exceptional items and certain re-measurements.
Operating cash flow
Net cash flows from operating activities were US$422 million in  
the year (2016: US$651 million). The key components were:
• An increase in operating profits before changes in working 
capital and other non-current items to US$789 million 
(2016: US$739 million), predominantly due to an increase  
in business performance profit before tax
• Net working capital outflows of US$213 million 
(2016: US$85 million inflow), including:
 – A decrease in trade and other payables of US$272 million, 
due primarily to a net unwinding of advances received from 
customers of US$167 million 
 – An increase in billings in excess of cost and estimated earnings 
of US$154 million, driven by favourable billing terms on a small 
number of projects
 – A decrease in accrued contract expenses of US$1 13 million 
due to actual costs incurred on E&C projects exceeding their 
percentage-of-completion based costs
• A reduction in interest paid on borrowing and finance leases to 
US$70 million (2016: US$94 million) following our exit from the 
Berantai RSC in 2016
• An increase in net income taxes paid to US$69 million 
(2016: US$40 million)
Capital expenditure
Group capital expenditure for 2017 , on a cash basis, decreased 
44% to US$170 million (2016: US$303 million), principally reflecting 
decreases in capital expenditure relating to the Greater Stella Area 
development, the Petrofac JSD6000 installation vessel and 
temporary camps for E&C projects.

Strategic report
Petrofac Annual report and accounts 2017 / 43 Free cash flow
Free cash flow decreased to US$281 million in the year (2016: 
US$386 million), primarily due to a net working capital outflow  
of US$213 million within net cash flows from operating activities 
(2016: US$85 million net inflow), partly offset by a 47% reduction  
in net cash flows used in investing activities:

The Group defines free cash flow as net cash flows from operating 
activities less net cash flows used in investing activities.
Dividends
In August 2017 , the Board approved a new sustainable dividend 
policy that targets a dividend cover of between 2.0x and 3.0x 
business performance net profit as the Group transitions back 
towards a low capital intensity business model. Going forward,  
it is proposed that the interim payment each year will be 
approximately 33% of the prior year total dividend.
In line with the policy, the Board is proposing a final dividend of  
25.3 cents per share (2016: 43.8 cents). The final dividend will be 
paid on 25 May 2018 to eligible shareholders on the register at  
27 April 2018 (the ‘record date’). Shareholders who have not elected 
to receive dividends in US dollars will receive a sterling equivalent. 
Shareholders can elect by close of business on the record date to 
change their dividend currency election. Together with the interim 
dividend of 12.7 cents per share (2016: 22.0 cents), this gives a total 
dividend for the year of 38.0 cents per share (2016: 65.8 cents).  
The dividend is covered by free cash flow.
Employees
At 31 December 2017 , the Group had approximately 12,500 
employees (including long-term contractors) (2016: 13,500).
Balance sheet
IES carrying value
The carrying amount of Integrated Energy Services’ portfolio

Working capital 
1
The net working capital balance at 31 December 2017 increased 
to US$422 million (31 December 2016: US$277 million). The key 
movements in working capital during the year were:
• A decrease in trade and other receivables of US$142 million  
to US$2,020 million (31 December 2016: US$2,162 million) 
predominantly reflecting the derecognition of US$128 million  
of trade receivables relating to the Santuario PEC (see note 21  
to the consolidated financial statements) 
• A decrease in trade and other payables of US$299 million to 
US$1,675 million (31 December 2016: US$1,97 4 million), primarily 
due to reductions in trade payables of US$1 19 million and a net 
unwinding of advances received from customers of US$167 
million (see note 29 to the consolidated financial statements)
• A decrease in accrued contract expenses of US$104 million  
to US$1,956 million (31 December 2016: US$2,060 million)  
due to actual costs incurred on E&C projects exceeding their 
percentage-of-completion based costs
• An increase in billings in excess of estimated earnings of 
US$154 million to US$198 million (31 December 2016:  
US$44 million), driven by favourable billing terms on a small 
number of projects
Finance leases
Net finance lease liabilities decreased 9% to US$166 million at 
31 December 2017 (2016: US$182 million; see note 18 to the 
consolidated financial statements) and predominantly relate to two 
leased floating production facilities on Block PM304 in Malaysia.
Total equity
Total equity at 31 December 2017 was US$948 million 
(2016: US$1,123 million), primarily reflecting the reported loss for 
the year of US$27 million and other comprehensive income of 
US$50 million, less dividends paid in the year of US$195 million 
and treasury shares purchased of US$39 million, which are held  
in the Petrofac Employees Benefit Trust for the purpose of making 
awards under the Group’s share schemes.
Return on capital employed
The Group’s return on capital employed for the year ended 
31 December 2017 increased to 21% (2016: 17%), reflecting 
improved profitability and a decrease in capital employed.

Excluding bank overdrafts, the Group’s total available borrowing 
facilities were US$2,210 million at 31 December 2017 
(2016: US$2,393 million). Of these facilities, US$645 million  
was undrawn as at 31 December 2017 (2016: US$631 million). 
Combined with the Group’s cash balances of US$967 million 
(2016: US$1, 167 million), the Group had substantial sources  
of liquidity available.
In May 2017 , Petrofac and its lenders agreed to extend 
US$1.0 billion of its US$1.2 billion revolving credit facility by  
one year to June 2021. During the year, the Company repaid  
a US$100 million term facility and refinanced a further 
US$200 million of term loans, extending their maturity by  
up to two years.
Exceptional items and re-measurements 
The following items, described as ‘exceptional items and certain 
re-measurements’ are excluded from business performance  
as exclusion of these items provides a clearer presentation of  
the underlying performance of the Group’s ongoing business.  
For further details of amounts comprising exceptional items  
and certain re-measurements, see note 5 to the consolidated  
financial statements. 
Exceptional items and certain re-measurements for 2017 amounted 
to a post-tax loss of US$372 million (2016: US$319 million loss),  
of which approximately US$350 million were non-cash items:
• The Board has confirmed its intention to exit the deep-water 
market triggering an impairment charge of US$176 million 
(post-tax) in relation to the JSD6000 installation vessel, which 
has been reclassified as an asset held for sale. We continue  
to pursue options to maximise value for the JSD6000.
• Impairments and exceptional items in relation to the IES division 
totalled US$179 million after tax, predominantly in relation to the 
Greater Stella Area development, re-assessment of production 
profiles, including a lower oil to gas ratio, Block PM304, due to  
a rephasing of future production, and Santuario, reflecting the 
terms secured on migration to a PSC.

Strategic report
Petrofac Annual report and accounts 2017 / 45 A safe, ethical and  
responsive business 
To achieve sustained commercial 
success, it is essential for Petrofac to 
have a strong commitment to corporate 
responsibility (CR). We remain acutely 
aware of the changing political, social 
and economic environment, and we  
see that our CR capability has a direct 
impact on our ability to:
• Deliver sustainable value to  
our stakeholders
• Maintain strong employee engagement
• Bid for challenging projects
• Optimise the performance of our assets
• Operate safe and secure projects
• Manage our risks
During 2017 , we continued to formalise  
our approach to CR, with several new 
initiatives, greater rigour, and improved 
reporting standards.
Raising our reporting standards
The better we measure our CR performance, 
the better we can manage it.
In 2017 , we continued to report in 
accordance with the Global Reporting 
Initiative (GRI) G4 (core) guidelines,  
and introduced several new  
performance indicators.
We also improved our CR reporting at 
www.petrofac.com with the publication  
of more of our policy statements.
Enhancing our compliance
To be effective, our CR policies and 
standards must be clearly understood  
and actively implemented. During 2017  
we therefore extended our CR awareness 
programmes and enhanced our 
compliance processes.
Supporting local suppliers  
and contractors
One thing that sets Petrofac apart is  
the extent to which we work with and 
support local suppliers and nurture local 
supply chains. Importantly, these partners 
are expected to abide by all of our CR 
policies. They are therefore covered  
by many of our related awareness and 
compliance programmes.
Understanding what matters  
most to our stakeholders
We work with a number of CR advisors to 
understand the issues that are of most 
interest to our stakeholders (including clients, 
suppliers, NGOs, government representatives, 
employees and industry associations).
In 2017 , we continued this process via 
formal discussions with a range of our 
senior managers. Based on this programme 
of engagement, we produce a materiality 
matrix (opposite), which sets out the CR 
issues that are important to our stakeholders 
and have the potential to impact our 
business. This matrix is updated annually  
to reflect feedback from both internal and 
external stakeholders, taking account of 
changing attitudes and priorities. It is used  
to inform our approach to CR and guide  
the quality of our CR programmes.
The remainder of this section of the report 
is structured around many of the topics 
highlighted in the matrix.

THE PETROFAC MATERIALITY MATRIX AND ISSUES FOR 2017
T o be successful in the long term, it is vital for  
any business to take a disciplined approach to 
Corporate Responsibility. Policies and processes 
are important. However, to be effective, they 
need to be actively managed and monitored. 
At Petrofac, the quality of our compliance is just  
as important as the strength of our commitment.

ENSURING SAFETY , ASSET 
INTEGRITY AND SECURITY
COMMITMENT
We are committed to protecting our people, our clients and the communities we work 
in, as well as the assets we design, build, operate and maintain. Our aspiration is for 
zero incidents.
Petrofac benefits from a strong safety record. 
To maintain our performance, we continue 
to enhance our well-established programme 
of health, safety, security, environment and 
integrity assurance (HSSEIA) measures. 
We also continue to refine the way we 
measure our performance and, during  
the past year, we launched 16 new global 
HSSEIA standards in key areas such as 
Workers’ Welfare and Golden Rules 
Deviations Management.
Across Petrofac, our aspiration is for zero 
safety incidents, and this is encapsulated in 
our vision, Horizon Zero. We aim to achieve 
zero harm to our people and assets,  
the local communities and environment.
Safety
Reflecting on our safety performance
2017 brought further improvements to an 
already strong safety record. For example:
• Fatalities – there were no reportable 
fatalities at any Petrofac sites in 2017 .
• Lost time injury frequency rate 
– edged down to 0.009 per 200,000 
man-hours, compared to an industry 
average of 0.054 (as extrapolated  
from 2016 figures from the  
International Association of Oil  
and Gas Producers, IOGP).
• Recordable incident frequency rate 
– fell to 0.05 per 200,000 man-hours, 
compared to an industry average of 0.21 
(IOGP , 2016 figures).Some of the more 
significant achievements include:
 – Britannia and Kittiwake UK offshore 
assets achieved 14 and 12 year 
LTI-free milestones respectively
 – Eight years LTI-free at the Jasmine 
FPSO in the Gulf of Thailand
 – ZADCO UZ750 project in the UAE 
reached more than 58 million  
man-hours LTI-free
 – Kuwait Oil Company presented a 
safety award for achieving 50 million 
safe man-hours
 – 53 million man-hours without an LTI  
at the Sohar Refinery Improvement 
Programme in Oman
 – In Malaysia we received two awards 
from PETRONAS for excellence in 
Safety, Health & Environment and  
for Integrated Operational & Asset 
Integrity Assurance.

CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY
CONTINUED • Implementing a new Driving  
Safety Policy – driving-related incidents 
continue to be one of the biggest risk 
factors for Petrofac. In 2017 , we raised 
the profile of this issue with the creation 
and adoption of a Global Driving Safety 
Policy. This was followed up with the 
implementation of our Group-wide 
driving safety campaign. For more 
information on this campaign, see the 
case study on page 50.
• Listening to the business needs  
and setting the tone from the top –  
we once again conducted 12 global 
‘HSSEIA Deep Dives’ at all our key offices. 
The output from these was fed into our 
annual safety conference attended by  
our 50 most senior leaders who, together, 
established common priorities for the  
next 12 months.
• Conducting a series of Group HSSEIA 
audits – we commenced a series of 
integrated Group HSSEIA audits across 
our offices, project sites and operated 
assets. In 2017 , we set an aggressive 
target of 10 audits, all of which were 
successfully completed, with the findings 
reported to senior management, 
provided to the respective management 
teams, and fed back into the HSSEIA  
planning process.
Extending our safety commitment  
to our suppliers and partners
All Petrofac safety policies and procedures 
apply equally to our suppliers and partners 
as well as our own employees. In 2017  
we brought more rigour to these 
relationships with a new Contractor 
HSSEIA Management Standard, which 
sets clear expectations covering every 
stage of a project – from pre-qualification 
right through to close-out.
Asset integrity
Ensuring the integrity of our  
operating assets
We are committed to designing,  
building and operating assets that are  
safe, reliable and meet or exceed their 
specified purpose.
Key to this is our Asset Integrity Framework, 
which enables us to take a structured and 
consistent approach to integrity across all 
Group operations. As we often operate 
ageing assets, it is particularly important  
for Petrofac to take a rigorous approach  
to asset integrity management.
In 2017 , the Group was responsible for 
managing and ensuring the integrity of a 
total of 21 operating assets. The number  
of assets varies throughout the year, as  
new assets come on stream and others 
transition out. We also seek to apply these 
asset integrity principles across the wider 
Group services to clients in support of  
their operations.
Reflecting on our asset integrity 
performance
In evaluating our asset integrity 
performance, our main area of focus is 
managing process safety hazards and 
reducing HiPos, or incidents that could 
have resulted in significant environmental  
or operational issues. For 2017 , five asset 
integrity-related HiPos were recorded  
on Petrofac operated assets (down from  
1 1 in 2016).
Regrettably, during 2017 , we experienced a 
number of failures in our pipelines in Mexico 
(see Protecting the Environment section  
for details of the impact). These were 
subsequently repaired and a programme  
of work was initiated to fully understand the 
true condition of the surrounding pipelines 
and minimise the likelihood of future 
incidents. This follows a basic strategy of: 
“understand the condition, understand  
how the condition is changing and have  
a strategy to manage it”.
 “We are still on the journey towards 
Horizon Zero, but the awards and 
performance show that we are 
heading in the right direction  
and must never be complacent.”
Hanif Hashim
Petrofac Malaysia General Manager
In evaluating our safety performance,  
we pay particular attention to high potential 
incidents (HiPos) that could have resulted  
in a fatality or serious injury had the 
circumstances been slightly different.  
In 2017 , the rate fell to 0.019 (from 0.021  
in 2016). Despite a reduction in our HiPo 
rate, driving and lifting operations continue  
to give rise to the majority of these incidents 
(accounting for 29% and 41 % respectively), 
so we will further strengthen our 
programmes in these areas during 2018.
Strengthening our safety culture
Our performance can be attributed to  
the strength of the Petrofac safety culture, 
which was bolstered by several new 
initiatives in 2017 . These included:
• Implementing the new Petrofac 
Assurance Index – the Petrofac Golden 
Rules of Safety, which have been in place 
for many years, effectively address most 
safety risks. The new Petrofac Assurance 
Index helps us determine, location-by-
location, whether these Golden Rules  
are understood and being followed,  
as well as identifying opportunities  
for improvement.
• Increasing the visibility of high 
potential incidents – by adopting the 
Mining the Diamond initiative, we modified 
our HSSEIA reporting processes to bring 
increased visibility to HiPos. By highlighting 
their prevalence, we can keep the business 
focused on understanding and addressing 
the root cause of serious incidents.
• Rolling-out our Line of Fire campaign 
– our analysis revealed that a large 
proportion of safety incidents resulted 
from individuals unintentionally placing 
themselves in harm’s way. We therefore 
rolled out our new Line of Fire safety 
campaign to remind all personnel to be 
aware of, and stay well clear of, potential 
safety hazards (such as moving vehicles 
or lifting operations). To date we have 
delivered this training to 90,000 workers 
across our projects.
Strategic report
Petrofac Annual report and accounts 2017 / 49 Seeking continuous improvement  
in asset integrity
We continue to review and enhance our 
approach to asset integrity and assurance. 
Developments in 2017 included:
• Revitalising our design integrity 
assurance programme – we enhanced 
the level of reporting to the Quarterly 
Asset Integrity Review Board,  
to provide information to senior  
executive management.
• Implementing an offshore structures 
survey programme – following the 
recent pipeline surveys and tank surveys, 
we performed a systematic review of all 
Petrofac-operated offshore structures, 
established a better understanding of risks, 
and developed improvement programmes.
• Increasing the awareness of asset 
integrity across the Group – we extended 
our “Did you know?” initiative of education 
on asset integrity, and distributed several 
new asset integrity-related articles and 
videos on our Group intranet.
Security
Remaining attentive to a fast-
changing security environment
Petrofac works in some challenging 
environments with fast-changing security 
issues. Our aim is to protect our employees, 
partners and assets in a responsible 
manner , and to prevent any security-related 
disruption to our operations.
Our security team is therefore closely 
integrated into the wider HSSEIA 
community, and our Security Policy sets 
out the responsibilities of our leadership 
and each of our business units.
The success of our approach is demonstrated 
by the fact that, in 2017 , there were no 
significant security incidents to report.
Enhancing the protection we provide 
to our employees, partners and assets
To reflect the fast-changing security 
environment, we continue to review  
and refine our approach to security. 
Developments in 2017 included:
• Launched new Security Focal Point 
training – to ensure consistency of 
approach and reporting, we launched a 
new one-day training course for senior 
personnel at any sites where the threat 
does not warrant a dedicated Project 
Security Manager.
Addressing our biggest single  
area of safety risk
We analysed the main cause of the 
driving incidents within Petrofac and 
across our industry, and developed a 
Drive Safe campaign to address these 
issues: fatigue, speed, reversing, mobile 
phone use and not wearing seatbelts.
The campaign was delivered across the 
Group via several different channels, 
including toolbox talks, posters, banners 
and videos. Awareness training also 
included accident simulation using a 
seatbelt ‘Convincer’. For 2018, we will 
develop further our well-established 
Driving Standard, and work with our 
people and partners to ensure it is 
understood and implemented.
• Updating our Managing Our Security 
Risks Handbook – to enhance the 
delivery and management of security 
services, we refreshed and rolled out our 
Managing Our Security Risks Handbook, 
providing guidance to those people 
responsible for managing our security 
risks and protecting our assets.
• Implementing a series of Security 
Assurance visits – our central security 
teams visited a range of project sites to 
conduct independent security assurance 
and validation surveys, and identify 
opportunities for improvement.
• Developing a new emergency 
response and crisis management 
framework – to coincide with the 
restructuring of our Emergency 
Response Service Centre (ERSC),  
we reviewed and refreshed our 
emergency response and crisis 
management procedures.
DRIVING NEW  
LEVELS OF SAFETY 
AWARENESS WITH 
OUR DRIVE SAFE 
CAMPAIGN
• Refreshing our travel policies –  
to reflect the changing security 
environment, we conducted a full  
review of our travel policies.
• Increasing the awareness of  
security issues – we developed a  
new awareness campaign, including 
security-related emails and posters.
• Warehouse and Laydown Yard 
Security – to reduce the risk of theft  
of our inventory, we developed and 
rolled-out a new security checklist and 
an accompanying training programme.

To enable us to attract the right people, 
support them in their development, and 
strengthen our leadership capabilities,  
we employ HR professionals with expertise 
in a number of people-related disciplines. 
They are based in each of our key 
locations, use common tools, follow 
consistent processes, and deliver against  
a business-focused HR strategy.
A key to our distinctive, delivery-focused 
culture is the strength of our values (safe, 
ethical, innovative, responsive, quality and 
cost conscious, and driven to deliver). 
These values are therefore linked to our 
Group-wide performance management 
process and celebrated through our annual 
EVE (Excellence, Values, Energy) Awards.
Our PetroVoices survey enables us to 
monitor employee engagement, build on 
strengths and address concerns. Several 
of our 2017 HR initiatives were a direct 
response to the results from our last survey 
(conducted in 2016) such as greater focus 
on career development discussions as part 
of the performance management process. 
We will be following up on existing action 
plans and launching a new PetroVoices 
survey in 2018.
Adapting to a challenging 
business environment
As covered elsewhere in this Annual 
Report, the Group continues to adapt  
to a challenging business environment.  
As evidence of this, we saw a continued 
reduction in our headcount, which fell by 
around 7 .5% to reach 12,500. This was as 
a result of further efficiency gains and our 
formal exit from various operations.
In response to the business environment, 
we paused our graduate development 
programmes for the year, but intend to 
review this as the business environment 
improves or where contractual 
commitment exists, such as in Oman. 
Given the relative scarcity of oil and gas 
jobs, voluntary turnover levels are thought to 
be low throughout the industry. At Petrofac 
they remain at 6% (unchanged from 2016).
Enhancing our talent management 
and career progression programmes
The Group promotes a culture that values 
meritocracy, openness, fairness and 
transparency. In support of this, our 
Diversity and Inclusion Policy complies with 
all relevant legislation and best practice,

Strategic report
Petrofac Annual report and accounts 2017 / 51 strives to create an inclusive working 
environment for all, and deals with any 
complaint of discrimination seriously. 
Employees are made aware of this policy 
through their employment and we regularly 
monitor its effectiveness in areas such as 
recruitment and promotions, access to 
learning and career development. 
Petrofac is committed to providing equal 
opportunities in employment and to 
avoiding unlawful discrimination throughout 
the employee’s career with the Company, 
commencing with the recruitment and 
selection process and by providing 
ongoing support, training and development. 
If necessary, the Company will engage with 
Occupational Health Services to ensure 
appropriate support is given to employees 
with pre-existing health conditions and  
to those who may develop a disability 
during employment. 
With a clear emphasis on identifying and 
developing talent within our business, we 
launched the Learning Hub, a new integrated 
cloud-based system, which will over time 
support performance, talent, succession 
and competence management, as well as 
training management and e-learning.
This brings greater consistency to the  
ay people are developed and managed, 
and helps Petrofac to build capability  
and drive performance. It also means 
employees have easy and direct access to 
all of their competence, e-learning training, 
scorecard and appraisal information. 
Similarly, all line managers and department 
heads have easy access to information 
about the people in their teams.
Training was offered to all managers on how 
to use the new system, as well as their role in 
setting objectives and conducting mid-year 
and end-of-year reviews. Some 90% of 
employees who completed their mid-year 
reviews also had a career development 
discussion with their supervisor.
Enhancing our reward and 
recognition processes
In response to concerns raised in the 
PetroVoices survey, we published global 
job title conventions and detailed descriptions 
of our grades in order to give our employees 
more clarity on our organisation design and 
grading principles. To explain the process 
to line managers, a grading workshop was 
also developed.
ALIVE TO EMPLOYEE ATTITUDES
A disciplined follow-up to our 
employee engagement survey
Every two years, our PetroVoices global 
survey acts as a sounding board: it gives 
us an overview of employee attitudes 
across the Group, alerts us to concerns 
that may otherwise be overlooked,  
and enables us to track employee 
engagement levels.
In our 2016 survey, three themes recurred, 
irrespective of business unit, location or 
grade: people wanted the senior leadership 
team to be more visible; they wanted a 
clearer understanding of how reward and 
recognition works within Petrofac; and they 
wanted a better understanding of how we 
assess and manage talent.
To dig a little deeper, we held focus 
groups in each key location. We then  
put together a programme of activities  
to address the concerns and help make 
Petrofac an even better place to work.
In response, Group Chief Executive Ayman 
Asfari met personally with 125 of our most 
senior people to update them on the 
Company strategy and understand their 
career goals. This information was then 
cascaded down through the organisation. 
In addition, a number of related 
engagement initiatives were delivered, 
including ‘Ask the Leader’ sessions, 22 
Townhalls to share priorities, 1 1 sessions 
to promote understanding of our financial 
performance and business risks, talent 
management training, and related 
communications via our newsletters  
and intranet sites.
We want to be sure that the initiatives 
have a positive impact. So, the process  
of two-way communications continues. 
The focus groups continue to meet 
periodically, and our next PetroVoices 
survey is scheduled for 2018.
Building an engaged workforce 
with a sense of ownership
We actively encourage employee share 
ownership, believing that it builds commitment 
to the Company’s goals. In 201 7 , 38% of our 
employees participated in at least one of the 
Petrofac employee share schemes.
Staff in our UK business groups were also 
given the chance to decide which local 
charitable organisations should receive the 
largest donations from the Company’s  
Give As You Earn match-funding scheme.  
This generated a good response with  
those voted for including cancer support 
groups, a home nursing team, a neonatal  
unit and a hospice. In accordance with  
our Standard for the Prevention of Bribery 
and Corruption, no political donations or 
contributions were made during the year.
Improving the consistency and 
capability of our HR operations
A number of initiatives were introduced to 
improve the integration of HR teams across 
the Group, and enhance the skills of the 
people within them. For example, all HR 
teams now report to the Group HR function, 
rather than the individual business units.  
We also ran a global training programme  
on Influencing Skills for our HR teams and 
have more training planned for 2018.
We aligned third-party recruitment with 
regular recruitment across our engineering 
and construction projects during 2017  
to streamline processes and focus more 
attention on utilisation and cost. A system 
was implemented to manage these 
resources along with their payroll. In 2018 
we will be launching an online CV tool to 
assist internal recruitment and development 
across the organisation.

ENGAGING WITH  
LOCAL COMMUNITIES
COMMITMENT
Wherever we work, we are committed to being a good corporate citizen.
In particular, we aim to engage with local communities and other stakeholders to 
understand and manage the social impacts of our business, address any concerns, 
and maximise the benefits we are able to bring.
Often, we have a contractual or regulatory obligation to manage the impact our 
business may have on local communities. Across the Company, we also encourage  
a culture of active community engagement, and support many related initiatives.
Our community engagement initiatives  
fall into two main categories:
• Community development – where our 
operations are located close to local 
communities, we generally work with 
stakeholders to plan and implement 
initiatives that will benefit local people, 
such as skills training, creating 
opportunities for local labour, and 
investing in local supply chains.
• Strategic corporate giving – across the 
Group, we support community-based 
initiatives, with a particular focus on 
science, technology, engineering and 
mathematics (STEM) education. The aim 
is to contribute to a new generation of 
engineers and scientists by supporting 
the education and career development  
of young people.
Reflecting on our 2017 performance
Our overall approach and philosophy remained 
largely unchanged in 2017 , with continued 
support for many of our long-established 
programmes. Overall, the value of the 
investment mirrors the extent of our in-country 
operations. In 2017 spending increased  
to US$3.8 million, from US$2.7 million in 
2016, largely due to a one-off contribution  
of US$1 million towards the Nairiyah 
National Construction Training Centre  
in Saudi Arabia.
A priority for 201 7 was to continue to 
enhance the coherence, consistency and 
efficacy of our approach, to raise the profile  
of community engagement issues across  
the Group, and incorporate them into our 
wider business processes. For example,  
our community engagement approach and 
credentials play an increasingly prominent 
role in the bidding process. In addition, our 
risk assessment and security teams seek  
to understand and address any situations 
where community relations could negatively 
impact a project.
Continuing with our community 
development initiatives
We typically conduct community 
development initiatives when we act  
as the operator of a client’s assets.
In Mexico
In previous years, we had been particularly 
active in Mexico, and supported a range  
of projects related to sustainable livelihoods. 
Here, our investment reduced from  
US$2.2 million in 2016 to US$1.8 million  
in 2017 (75% of which is cost recoverable). 
This fall was largely due to the divestment  
of the Pánuco field, changes to land  
access payments and the continued 
renegotiation of our Production 
Enhancement Contracts elsewhere in  
the country. However, we continued to 
invest in capability building initiatives to 
enhance technical skills and agricultural 
practices in Tabasco state. Meanwhile, in 
Tamaulipas state, we invested in measures 
to support turtle conservation programmes.

Strategic report
Petrofac Annual report and accounts 2017 / 53 SUPPORTING 
UNDERPRIVILEGED 
CHILDREN IN INDIA
 INDIA
The theme of our corporate giving 
programmes is all about increasing  
the skills and employability of young 
people. In India, we support two 
charities that provide education for 
underprivileged children.
In both Delhi and Chennai, we support 
the Bharat Lok Shiksha Parishad (BLSP) 
welfare programme, which funds 200 
one-teacher schools, known as Ekal 
Vidyalayas. By sourcing someone from 
the local community, who teaches 
reading, writing and mental arithmetic, 
the scheme delivers basic skills to young 
people who otherwise go uneducated.
Meanwhile, in Mumbai, we partnered 
with the SMILE Foundation to improve 
the lives of underprivileged children 
living in urban slums and marginalised 
communities. In this way, we contributed 
to the education of 400 children, 
supplementing their education, and 
raising awareness and support from 
local communities.
We supported the SMILE Foundation  
for one year, while our BLSP partnership 
continues through 2018.
In Tunisia
Our Tunisian operations, located in the 
Kerkennah Islands, restarted in May 2017 , 
following a lengthy suspension due to 
social unrest linked to the local economic 
situation. Prior to start-up, consultation with 
local community groups and stakeholders 
was undertaken to ensure our community 
development programmes were 
appropriately focused and sustainable. 
Through 2017 around US$370,000  
was provided for various local projects. 
These focused on improving the public 
infrastructure, supporting the local fishing 
industry (with the purchase of the first  
five new engines for 15 fishing boats),  
and a bursary programme to support  
more than 70 gifted students at 12 primary  
and secondary schools.
Enhancing our strategic corporate 
giving programmes
We have a formal corporate giving strategy 
focusing on initiatives that promote STEM 
education and improve employability for 
young people from marginalised groups. 
We also support various philanthropic 
initiatives that enhance employee 
engagement, by working with charities  
that are relevant to employees or are 
located close to our offices.
Highlights from 2017 include:
In the UAE
Around US$300,000 was contributed to 
various charities and initiatives. This was  
a considerable increase on 2016, thanks 
largely to our employees’ involvement in  
the Relay for Life event organised by 
Friends of Cancer Patients (FoCP).  
More than 50 Petrofac employees and 
family members took part in the 24-hour 
relay, raising US$143,000 to support  
cancer patients and their families.
In India
There is a regulatory requirement for us  
to spend at least 2% of our revenues  
on social investments, which led to an 
investment of more than US$300,000 
in support of three education programmes 
targeting under-privileged children.
In Malaysia
At the end of 2016, to commemorate 
achieving a 50 million man-hours LTI-free 
milestone, our E&C division donated 
US$50,000 split across 10 countries. 
In 2017 , US$5,000 of this was presented  
to the Rumah Safiyyah Children’s Shelter  
to support various road and fire safety 
education programmes in conjunction  
with the local Malaysian Fire and  
Rescue Department.
In the UK
We encourage charitable donations  
through a Give As You Earn Scheme  
and a match-funding programme.  
Despite the difficult climate of the past  
few years, our employees remained 
committed to improving the lives of others. 
In 2017 , £18,000 was raised by employees, 
with a like-for-like contribution of £18,000 
from Petrofac. The total amount was 
donated to a number of local and national 
UK charities nominated by our employees.
Looking ahead to 2018
In 2018 we will continue with the same 
overall approach and philosophy.
For our community development 
programmes, we will continue with our 
planned investments in Tunisia, with 
additional support for the local fishing 
industry (which is the main source of local 
employment), and a further contribution to 
the local transport infrastructure (which will 
improve access to and from the islands). 
Meanwhile, in Mexico, to support the ongoing 
migration of our Production Enhancement 
Contracts to Production Sharing Contracts, 
we will be undertaking a social performance 
and environmental baseline study and 
update our programmes to reflect the 
nature and extent of our changing business 
operations and increased responsibilities.
For our strategic corporate giving 
programmes, we will review and update 
our strategy and work with the country 
operations to support alignment of 
programmes to the revised strategy.  
We will also be commencing new initiatives 
in Oman, including a partnership with the 
engineering faculty of the Sultan Qaboos 
University. In India, our CSR Committee  
will review our partnerships and projects  
for 2018. Elsewhere, we will continue  
with the same approach as in 2017 .

Understanding and addressing potential 
human rights issues is a matter of priority 
for Petrofac, and a Labour Rights Steering 
Group made up of relevant heads of 
department, which reports directly to 
executive management and has Board 
oversight of Directors, has been leading  
our response.
Our newly developed Labour Rights 
Standard sets out the expectations and 
requirements of our people, subcontractors 
and suppliers. Meanwhile, our annual 
transparency statement, published in 
compliance with the UK Modern Day 
Slavery Act, sets out our commitments  
as to how we intend to strengthen our 
approach and embed the underlying 
principles throughout our operations.
Checking the chain
Through our due diligence programmes, 
we know that our main exposure to 
potential human rights issues is through 
our supply chain and, more specifically,  
its employment of low-skilled migrant 
workers from ‘high risk’ countries. We are 
aware that the labour practices of agents 
used by some of our subcontractors 
potentially expose the company to labour 
rights risks. Many of these issues are not 
always immediately evident and we are 
working with our subcontractors to map 
out our supply chain, and identify and 
address any recruitment violations and 
welfare infringements
A further area of potential vulnerability  
is our use of contracted security providers. 
To better understand the related risks,  
we intend to conduct security and human 
rights risk assessments, and monitor 
compliance with our newly strengthened 
requirements and expectations.
In addressing potential vulnerabilities,  
we are assisted by an increased awareness 
of human rights issues across our sector, 
and the emergence of new regulations, 
such as the UK Modern Day Slavery Act. 
This means that many of our clients and 
stakeholders, such as international 
investors and finance providers, are 
seeking assurances that we are doing  
what we can to eradicate the potential for 
abuses. It also means that our vendors and 
suppliers are under pressure, not just from 
Petrofac but also our peers, to introduce 
new protections and report on their 
respective performance.
PRIORITIES AND PERFORMANCE
2017 Priorities 2017 Performance 2018 Priorities
• Strengthen our approach

RESPECTING HUMAN RIGHTS 
ACROSS OUR SUPPL Y CHAIN
COMMITMENT
Petrofac operates in challenging environments where human rights issues can 
become a source of risk, both for our business and for some of the people who  
work on our sites. 
We are committed to embedding and advancing respect for human rights throughout 
our business operations, including our extended supply chain. As such, we aim  
to work in accordance with the United Nations Global Compact and its principles,  
as well as the core conventions of the International Labour Organization (ILO). 
Strategic report
Petrofac Annual report and accounts 2017 / 55 We also believe that, aside from our 
responsibilities as a good corporate citizen, 
the introduction of greater human rights 
protections can benefit our business. 
When workforces are treated with respect 
and dignity, productivity can be increased 
and the scope for delays and disputes 
significantly reduced.
Delivering progress in 2017
Petrofac’s Ethical, Social and Regulatory 
policy prevents us from engaging in any 
business activities that could implicate the 
Company in the breach of internationally 
recognised labour standards. Most human 
rights protections were implicitly covered 
through a range of Company policies and 
standards, however, in 2017 , our priorities 
were to make our commitment more visible, 
make the protections more explicit, and 
make progress in embedding a respect for 
human rights throughout our supply chain. 
Significant developments included:
• Our initial statement in compliance with 
the UK Modern Day Slavery Act was 
published in May, in which we reported 
on progress and outlined our 
commitments for the year ahead
• Our new Labour Rights Standard  
was launched in August, which was 
distributed internally and to our main 
subcontractors, and is being 
communicated to all our suppliers
• New labour rights clauses were  
finalised and included in all new  
third-party contracts
• New wording was developed for 
inclusion in our Code of Conduct
• We engaged with various industry social 
responsibility and human rights groups  
to share technical know-how and 
contribute to the development of good 
practice guidance
• A training and awareness programme  
for employees and subcontractors was 
developed and an initial session delivered 
to our Executive Management
• A formal review of the Labour Rights 
programme was undertaken by our 
Group Internal Audit function to evaluate 
its design effectiveness
• Work commenced on a new Welfare 
Standard to be launched in 2018.
Our commitments for 2018  
and beyond
In 2018, our priority will be to continue to 
roll out and embed the various initiatives 
and resources that were developed in 
2017 . This will include:
• The new Labour Rights and Welfare 
Standards
• The new training and awareness 
programme
• The newly updated Code of Conduct.
Meanwhile, we will strengthen our 
subcontractor compliance assurance 
processes and extend our third-party due 
diligence programme, which will help us 
to adequately screen all new and newly 
contracted suppliers. We will also 
commence a series of project audits to 
assess the level of compliance in sites 
and address any issues encountered.
Looking further ahead, we aim to expand 
on our reporting and extend our efforts 
deeper into the supply chain. We also intend 
to increase our engagement with industry 
and other stakeholders on joint initiatives 
to adopt common principles and practices, 
develop practitioner tools, and drive 
innovation and continuous improvement.
PLACING AN 
EMPHASIS  
ON WORKER 
WELFARE  
IN MALAYSIA
 MALAYSIA
 Design  Build
For Petrofac, topics like safety, 
security and human rights are 
not just about good corporate 
citizenship. We also see them 
as business issues. For us, 
a safe site is an efficient site. 
When worker welfare is 
prioritised, productivity can  
be increased and the scope 
for delays and disputes 
significantly reduced.
A good example of our approach is the 
RAPID project in Malaysia, where there’s  
a visible commitment to worker welfare. 
To keep standards high, the Petrofac-built 
onsite accommodation that houses 1,800 
workers and supervisors is independently 
audited on a regular basis. It is judged 
against stringent criteria like cleanliness, 
hygiene and comfort. Petrofac has 
received a Focused Recognition Award 
from PETRONAS for its worker welfare, 
accommodation and recreational facilities.
A grievance management procedure has 
also been implemented, to ensure that 
workers’ concerns can be aired and 
addressed. Similarly, Petrofac enjoys 
a stellar safety record. The congested, 
muddy site is amongst the most 
challenging the Company has worked in. 
Even so, by the end of 2017 , the team had 
clocked up nearly 9 million man-hours 
without a single Lost Time Incident, 
and had received HSSE awards from 
PETRONAS on three separate occasions.
One of the keys to this success is the 
strength of the partnership between 
Petrofac and its suppliers. We chose  
to work exclusively with locally based 
subcontractors, helping them to source, 
recruit and train a high proportion of 
Malaysian workers, and ensuring that  
they understand and respect our 
CSR commitments and standards.

GENERATING ECONOMIC  
VALUE IN-COUNTRY
COMMITMENT
The support of local economies has 
always been important to Petrofac.
Wherever the Company operates,  
we are committed to employing local 
people, working with local suppliers  
and developing local capabilities. 
As well as being the right thing to do,  
we see this as a source of competitive 
advantage, helping us to keep costs 
down, improve the quality and availability 
of local suppliers, and build stronger 
relationships with local stakeholders.
In this way, we aim to make a positive 
and measurable contribution to the  
economies in which we operate.
Alongside client value and shareholder 
value, we consider in-country value (ICV)  
as one of the three core outcomes of our 
business model. The concept of ICV  
seeks to formalise and quantify the net 
contribution Petrofac makes to the 
economies in which we operate.
Across many of our projects we have 
started to evaluate our impact. We are also 
becoming more consistent in the way we 
set and monitor ICV targets, and share the 
lessons learned across the Group. We are 
also providing increased support to our 
supply chain through our training and 
project engagement initiatives. 
Reflecting on our 2017 performance
We continue to purchase a large proportion 
of goods and services from local vendors 
and suppliers, and also support a significant 
number of local jobs. Typically, this goes  
well beyond our contractual and regulatory 
obligations regarding local content.
Working with local suppliers
In 2017 , just taking into account the key 
projects listed on page 37 , we purchased 
more than US$1.2 billion worth of goods 
and services. This is down from  
US$2.3 billion spent on key projects in 
2016, reflecting the changing stage of  
their delivery. Meanwhile the proportion  
of locally sourced goods and services 
increased from 33% in 2016 to 50%  
in 2017. 
For various reasons, including the size of 
the country and the capability of the local 
supply chain, the level of local content 
varies by country. For example, in the UAE, 
where we are delivering projects worth 
US$2.9 billion, more than 71% of 
procurement came from the local supply 
chain. The equivalent figure in Malaysia 
was 73%, Algeria 63% and in Saudi 50%.
US$1.2bn 75,500 US$422m
58 / Petrofac Annual report and accounts 2017
CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY
CONTINUED Supporting local employment 
We continue to work towards gathering 
consistent data to report on the level and 
nature of employment on our key sites.  
Our aim is to understand the total number 
of jobs created, as well as the ratio 
between local and expatriate workers.
At the close of 2017 , and just taking into 
account the key projects listed on page 37 , 
we supported over 75,000 jobs at our 
project sites. Around 95% of these were 
through our subcontractors, the remainder 
being a mix of expatriate and local Petrofac 
employees and contractors.
The extent to which subcontractor jobs are 
held by locals or expatriates is determined 
partly by local content requirements and 
partly by the availability of qualified 
candidates. In some countries, such  
as Algeria, the percentage of local 
subcontractor workers can exceed 85%.  
In others, such as Saudi Arabia, it can fall 
below 10%.
Making a significant contribution  
to public finances
Through the taxes we pay, Petrofac makes 
a significant financial contribution to the 
public finances of the local economies in 
which we operate.
In 2017 , the total amount paid to 
governments in tax was US$422 million, 
comprising corporate income tax, 
employment taxes, other forms of tax  
and social security contributions.
Decreases in total taxes paid have largely 
resulted from material projects reaching 
completion in jurisdictions which operated 
VAT regimes in the reporting period.
Transparency in tax reporting 
Ensuring tax compliance and increasing 
tax transparency continue to be priorities 
for governments, regulators and businesses. 
During 201 7 , several new compliance and 
reporting obligations affecting our business 
came into force. We monitor regional and 
global best practice, maintain membership 
of industry groups and follow and provide 
input into tax policy development.
In 2017 , we:
• Published our tax strategy, providing 
further insight into how we approach  
the management of our tax affairs 
(available in the ‘Responsibility’ section  
of www.petrofac.com)
• Submitted our first country-by-country 
report, in accordance with the OECD 
standard, which provides visibility to tax 
authorities in respect of income taxes 
paid and certain measures of economic 
activity on a country-by-country basis 
• Worked alongside our clients, 
subcontractors and suppliers, including 
supporting and guiding businesses  
in our supply chain, to achieve day-one 
compliance with the introduction of  
VAT in the Gulf Cooperation Council 
region in 2018
The total amount that we pay in taxes is  
not limited to the corporate income tax 
disclosed within the financial statements.  
It also includes employee and employer 
taxes and social security payments, VAT 
and sales taxes, and other taxes such as 
withholding, property and other indirect 
taxes. The total amount paid by Petrofac  
to governments worldwide includes those 
taxes which are borne by Petrofac, as well 
as taxes collected by Petrofac but which 
are recoverable from tax authorities or 
customers and supplies. VAT and sales 
taxes are shown on an accruals basis.
Priorities for 2018
Local delivery is intrinsic to the Petrofac 
business model. We will therefore continue 
to make a contribution to the economies in 
which we operate. And this contribution 
tends to be commensurate with the extent 
of our operations.
In Oman, for example, we will continue to 
develop the breadth and depth of our ICV 
contribution, including the first year of 
operations for the Takatuf Petrofac Oman 
training centre, the growth of our new 
Muscat-based engineering centre, and  
the continued support of local suppliers.
Strategic report
Petrofac Annual report and accounts 2017 / 59 INVESTING FOR OMAN
 OMAN
 Design  Build
We have been active in Oman since  
1988, where we are working on several 
mega-projects, have recently secured 
several new business wins, and continue 
to increase our locally based capabilities.  
In support of a Government-led 
Omanisation agenda, we are pursuing  
an In-Country Value (ICV) strategy  
based on four key pillars: Omanisation  
in operations, local vendor development, 
local sourcing of goods and services,  
and developing local skill sets.
By the start of 2017 , some 830 people 
were directly employed by Petrofac,  
more than 35% of whom were Omani 
nationals. In addition, up to 12,000 people 
are employed through subcontractors 
and, again, many of them are Omani 
nationals. We also have a growing office 
in Muscat, and are developing a locally 
based engineering centre.
To help develop local skills sets, we have 
a 40% share in Takatuf Petrofac Oman 
(TPO), which is creating a new US$30 
million training centre with a full-time 
faculty of 45 people. This will help to 
deliver a steady stream of job-ready 
graduates, and can also upskill existing 
field personnel.
With regards to local sourcing and 
vendor development, we continue to 
seek new opportunities to create ICV.  
For example, in 2017 we ran a supplier 
roadshow to support our recently 
awarded Salalah LPG extraction project, 
attended by 15 community leaders and 
120 representatives from the local supply 
chain, and a number of additional 
community contractors were engaged as 
a direct result. To date, we have invested 
over US$1.4 billion in ICV, of which some 
85% has been spent through local goods 
and services, as well as supplier 
development and training initiatives.
As our Country Manager, Ray Richardson 
says: “A few years ago the contracting 
community had little choice but to look 
outside of Oman for goods, services and 
skills. That is changing quickly. There is 
now a much wider variety and availability 
of local services and, for our part, we 
have actively worked with several key 
suppliers to help them improve and  
scale up their local operations. With 
greater capacity, capability and 
competition available right here in  
Oman, everyone benefits.”
Currently with a number of high value 
Oman projects about to go into execution 
we look forward to developing our 
existing ICV footprint within the key  
pillars of our operational reach.

Petrofac Annual report and accounts 2017 / 61
CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY
CONTINUED As an oil field services company that 
designs, develops and operates large-scale 
facilities, Petrofac’s business is directly  
linked to environmental considerations.  
This includes energy and climate change 
concerns and the risk of environmental 
incidents, as well as the environmental 
performance of our own operations.
We conduct comprehensive environmental 
risk assessments and reviews in all stages 
of our new projects. We also follow a 
systematic approach to environmental 
management, even in places where this  
is not required by local regulations.
In terms of our emissions performance,  
all indications (such as our participation  
in CDP) suggest that we perform 
comparably with our peers. In 2017 we 
achieved a rating of ‘C’, which is in line with 
the average for our direct competitors. 
Regrettably, it falls below the ‘B’ rating  
we achieved in 2016. This drop was  
due to a change in the way companies  
are rated following a revised CDP  
scoring methodology. 
Furthermore, for all of our business lines, 
we aim to achieve a 2% year-on-year 
reduction in greenhouse gas emission 
intensity over the baseline year of 2015, 
with a 20% reduction by 2030. These 
targets are supported by strategies and 
actions to optimise energy consumption, 
implement technical solutions, and 
encourage employee-led initiatives.
Our energy data and greenhouse gas 
emissions are assured and verified by an 
independent third party (Ricardo, UK).
Reflecting on our overall performance
Overall the trend was positive for 2017 ,  
with lower emissions and fewer spills. 
In terms of emissions, we achieved  
a significant improvement in our 
performance. We have achieved a 14% 
reduction in greenhouse gas intensity in 
Integrated Energy Services and an 8% 
reduction in Engineering & Construction 
divisions over 2016, meeting our emission 
reduction targets.
The change was largely due to energy 
efficiency initiatives implemented in our 
offices and training centres, optimisation  
of operations in Malaysia, and lower fuel 
consumption at our projects.
We have now revised our spill reporting 
methodology to be in line with the industry 
practice and avoid the double reporting of 
spills between ourselves and our clients. 
Within our Annual Report, we will be 
reporting spills from: 
• All Petrofac owned and operated facilities 
and assets including projects
• Assets where Petrofac is the operator 
and has an equity share in the 
hydrocarbons being produced 
• Assets where Petrofac is the operator 
and licensee 
The hydrocarbon spills at facilities we 
operate on behalf of our client, but the 
client remains as the licensee, will be 
reported by our clients and will not be 
included in our data.
There were two reportable hydrocarbon 
spills involving more than one barrel of 
hydrocarbon this year. The hydrocarbon 
spill volume was 52 barrels in 2017 , 
regrettably an increase from 16 barrels  
in 2016.
Both the spills occurred at offshore facilities 
operated by Petrofac in the North Sea, UK. 
The release of 50 barrels was due to the 
breakage of a non-operated export pipeline.
During 2017 the volume of oil spilled 
through acts of vandalism dramatically 
increased in the assets we operate for our 
client in the Southern Region of Mexico. 
We have been working with the local 
communities and regulatory bodies in an 
attempt to reduce the number of spills we 
are experiencing in this region. In this area, 
vandals tamper with both wellheads and 
pipelines resulting in oil releases to the 
surrounding environment. 
Investigation and clean-up of contaminated 
areas is carried out for each spill, and we 
continue to liaise with clients to address the 
root cause of the incidents.
To prevent vandalism on the wellheads, 
Petrofac installed tamperproof valve covers 
and subsurface H valves on wellheads in 
locations that had a high incidence of 
vandalism. This resulted in a significant 
drop in the number of wellhead related  
oil spills. Unfortunately, we are now 
experiencing a rise in the number of 
releases associated with people 
intentionally cutting into the pipelines we 
operate on behalf of our client. 
Hopefully a new piece of legislation that 
fines individuals found to be responsible for 
causing oil spills, along with a reduction in 
the compensation provided to landowners, 
will have a positive impact on the number 
of pipe spills caused by vandalism. We are 
also increasing pipeline inspection activities 
to reduce the time it takes to identify a 
pipeline spill. This includes the installation  
of flow meters and increasing the visual 
surveillance of pipelines through line walks 
and the use of drones.
We expect there to be an increase in spill 
numbers and volumes during 2018 as 
Petrofac has now entered into a Production 
Sharing Contract with Pemex in Santuario, 
Mexico, which is an area affected by 
vandalism, and any such incidents will be 
recordable in our reporting going forward.
Continuing improvements in  
energy efficiency
For many years, energy efficiency has  
been an area of focus. This is indicated by 
a large number of local initiatives, and is 
prominently featured in the Policy Vision  
of our Environmental Policy, which is 
intended to guide all of our activities.
Once again, we are able to report on 
several such successes for 2017 .
Adding value to our clients’ operations 
Our teams often go beyond client 
requirements as they seek to optimise 
energy efficiency and save natural 
resources. In doing so, they consider  
the entire life cycle of a project, and are 
often able to propose solutions that  
can have significant long-term 
environmental benefits.
Mexico
Our Mexican teams initiated a 
 bio-remediation project to treat soil  
that has been contaminated with  
spilt hydrocarbons. This approach 
bio-simulates and accelerates a natural 
de-contamination process through  
the introduction of indigenous 
microorganisms, nutrients and oxygen. 
Lined pits are constructed at a spill-site, 
and microorganisms and nutrients are then 
added, followed by the contaminated soil. 
Aeration is carried out at regular intervals

CONTINUED  UNITED ARAB EMIRATES
Reducing energy consumption  
by almost 50% in Sharjah
The facilities management team in  
our Sharjah offices have achieved  
a significant reduction in energy 
consumption, earning them an award 
for energy management.
Johnson Controls, who provide a 
range of building services at our two 
Sharjah office towers, awarded the 
team their 2017 Energy Management 
Award. The team achieved a 49% 
reduction in energy costs (compared 
to the base year of 2009) thanks  
to the smart use of analysis tools, 
reprogramming existing systems, 
rewiring circuits, shifting to LED lights, 
and reducing the leakage of cool air  
by plugging openings in the buildings.
Together, the initiatives have saved 
around 3,400 tonnes in annual 
greenhouse gas emissions.
and the soil is repeatedly tested for its 
hydrocarbon content. Once the oxidation 
of hydrocarbons is achieved, test reports 
are presented to the regulatory body for 
approval before the soil is returned to the 
ground. By avoiding the transportation of 
contaminated soil, the initiative reduces 
greenhouse gas emissions and reduces 
the risk of driving-related incidents.
Saudi Arabia
A client in Saudi Arabia had originally 
specified a water filtration package with a 
conventional filtration system. Our engineers 
thought about the long-term operational 
implications of this approach. They were 
concerned that it would not be energy 
efficient and, to deal with the associated 
wastewater, it would also require a 
considerable investment in downstream 
facilities such as backwash pits, pumps  
and evaporation ponds. Instead, they 
successfully proposed an alternative 
solution that, during the expected 
operational life of the facility, will avoid more 
than 3,000kg of greenhouse gas emissions 
and save half a million gallons of water.
United Kingdom 
When lessons are shared across the entire 
industry, the risk of environmental incidents 
can be significantly reduced.
Oilennium, a company within the Petrofac 
Group, worked with the International Well 
Control Forum to develop a new well 
control awareness e-learning course. 
Aimed at anyone involved in well 
operations, it covers the recommendations 
set out by the International Association of  
Oil and Gas Producers following the 
Deepwater Horizon incident.
Intended to increase awareness of well 
control and integrity issues, it is available, 
free of charge, to anyone with internet 
access. The programme has been widely 
commended and, by the end of 2017 ,  
more than 24,000 people had completed 
the course.
Oman
Over the life cycle of an oil and gas  
asset, the choice of ancillary equipment 
has a significant impact on overall 
environmental performance.
When specifying the details of a new  
LPG facility, our client had included a 
20mw oil-fired heater. During Petrofac’s 
value engineering process, our engineers 
concluded that, by capturing waste  
energy from a nearby turbine exhaust and 
controlling the heat with a damper, they 
could eliminate the need for the heater and 
its associated fittings. To make their case, 
they simulated various design scenarios.
As a result, the client will save an estimated 
7 million cubic metres of LPG and avoid 
16,000 tonnes of greenhouse gas 
emissions every year.

Our Code of Conduct (the Code) sets  
out our expectations of everyone who 
works for and with Petrofac. Through our 
compliance programme, we aim to ensure 
that all our employees and third parties 
working with and for us are aware of  
the Code and abide by its contents.  
We continue to increase the scope and 
reach of the compliance programme  
by hiring new resources, introducing new 
tools and strengthening the governance 
that informs our approach to ethical 
business practices. We endeavour to 
ensure that our operations remain 
compliant with our Code, internal policies, 
rules and regulations.
Enhancing our compliance  
policies and processes
Across our sector, there is an increasing 
requirement for organisations to demonstrate 
the strength of their commitment to ethical 
business practices, and the integrity of 
compliance policies and processes. 
To this end, in April 2017 we commissioned 
an independent risk consultancy to conduct 
a comprehensive review of all of our policies, 
documents, processes and delegated 
authorities. The aim was to enhance their 
effectiveness and ensure that the organisation 
as a whole, with the assistance of the 
Compliance function, continues to identify 
any compliance related risk which might 
affect the business and mitigate it in a 
timely and robust manner.
At the end of 2017 , this work was still 
underway. However, achievements during 
the year included:
• Creation of a new Compliance Charter
• An increase in compliance-related 
resources to assist in the overall delivery 
of the programme
• A review of our policies and guidelines 
regarding gifts and entertainment and 
conflicts of interest
• A review of our due diligence process  
of third parties and formalisation of a 
related policy
• Formation of the new Compliance and 
Ethics Committee and the Third Party

CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY
CONTINUED Responding to requests  
for information
During the year, we responded successfully 
to increased requests for information on 
our compliance programme. This was as 
part of general due diligence carried out  
in respect of bid-related and contracting 
activities with both current and potential 
clients, giving them assurance on the 
robustness of our compliance governance. 
We also responded to additional ad hoc 
requests from external stakeholders, such 
as project finance providers, in relation to  
a number of new contract awards with an 
external financing component.
Typically, we were asked by these third 
parties to provide assurance relating to  
the nature and integrity of our compliance 
related policies and processes, how these 
are implemented and monitored on a 
day-to-day basis.
Giving clear guidance to employees 
and partners
During 2017 we continued with a full  
review of the Code, to include new, more 
explicit language relating to the protection 
of human rights and the prevention of 
bribery and corruption, money laundering 
and trade sanctions risks. The intention 
was to launch the new Code and related 
e-learning by the end of 2017 . However,  
in light of the wider review, this was 
postponed until 2018.
Enhancing our certification process
Whilst following the Code is an obligation  
of all employees, upholding the Code and 
looking out for any suspected breaches  
is a key accountability for all managers 
(from first-level supervisors through to  
our executive leadership team).
We continue to refine our Annual Code of 
Conduct Declaration process. This is an 
annual exercise through which managers 
confirm that they understand and abide by 
the Code, have completed related training, 
and have the opportunity to raise any 
possible violations or conflicts of interest. 
In 2017 , 2,800 managers were required  
to certify and, by the end of the exercise, 
the proportion who had done so was 
almost 100%.
Speaking Up about any  
breaches of the Code
We encourage everyone involved with 
Petrofac to raise any potential breaches  
of the Code and have a non-retaliatory 
policy for those who raise any such issues in 
good faith.
In 2017 , 102 suspected breaches were 
reported via Speak Up (our multi-language 
phone, online and email whistleblowing 
tool, which is accessible to all employees 
and third parties), each of which was 
assessed by the Compliance function and, 
where warranted, was either investigated  
or was being investigated at the year end. 
Compared with 2016, the number of 
reported breaches increased by 44%  
(up from 71).
All submitted cases and confirmed violations 
are now reported to the Compliance and 
Ethics Committee, which will liaise with the 
Audit Committee on cases relating to any 
financial breaches. 
In 2018, as part of the reorganisation of  
the Compliance function, an investigations 
manager, with the responsibility to manage 
internal investigations and monitor any 
possible consequence that may arise from 
them, will be appointed. This individual will 
report jointly to the Group Compliance and 
Internal Audit functions and will oversee the 
activities of those conducting investigations 
within Petrofac, ensuring that they have 
received appropriate training.

Strategic report
Petrofac Annual report and accounts 2017 / 65 year the Board continued to provide 
support, thereby enabling management to 
focus on effective strategic execution and 
project delivery. This ensured that process 
improvements and lessons learned from 
prior projects could be implemented.
Investigation
We reported last year that the Board had 
committed to carrying out additional audit 
work during 2017 to strengthen the 
Company’s existing controls environment. 
This was prompted by the 2016 media 
allegations relating to the historical provision 
of services to the Company by Unaoil. While 
this work was underway, the instigation of 
the Serious Fraud Office (SFO) investigation 
in May 2017 changed the focus for the 
Board. The Board sub-committee, which 
had been initially formed in 2016, was 
expanded and its membership increased 
with the remit of being solely responsible for 
the Company’s engagement with the SFO, 
and to oversee the Company’s response  
to the SFO investigation. 
This sub-committee recommended the 
establishment of a new Board Committee 
to uphold and oversee the implementation 
of the compliance and ethics principles and 
rules, which are set out in the Company’s 
Code of Conduct and the appointment of 
an external specialist. The Compliance and 
Ethics Committee was formed during the 
second half of 2017 and further details of 
the work carried out by this Committee  
are set out on pages 88 and 89. While the 
SFO investigation is ongoing, it is not yet 
possible to identify the timescale in which 
this matter might reach a conclusion. 
Nonetheless, the Board continues to have 
confidence in Petrofac’s people, processes 
and its long-term prospects to deliver the 
strategy, and acknowledges the significant 
amount of work undertaken during 2017 
across the Group. 
Rijnhard van Tets
Non-executive  
Chairman
Governance and risk management
Notwithstanding the ongoing investigation, 
governance and risk management 
continue to be a key area of focus for the 
Group to ensure that enhanced processes 
can be embedded throughout the 
organisation. The risks associated with 
non-compliance with laws and regulations 
can be significant and the Board is 
therefore committed to ensuring that 
robust internal controls are in place to 
mitigate threats that may be encountered.
Diversity
Petrofac continues to believe that diversity is 
wider than simply gender and aims to recruit 
on merit and hire the best candidates with 
the widest range of skills and experience, 
whatever their background or gender. With 
around 80 nationalities employed within 
Petrofac, we consider that our business 
benefits greatly from our varied employee 
base, including those at senior management 
and Board levels. The Petrofac Board, made 
up of six different nationalities, with both 
male and female members, is already 
diverse, but we will continue to keep this 
matter under review.
Changes to the Board
Details of changes to the Board that took 
place during 2017 are set out on pages  
80 and 81. 
I am honoured to have served the Company 
as its Chairman over the last four years. I am 
content that I will leave behind not only a 
competent Board, ably led by René Médori, 
but a strong senior management team that 
can work together effectively and provide 
oversight and governance to implement 
best practice recommendations and 
improvements throughout the year.
Rijnhard van Tets
Chairman
28 February 2018
It is the Board’s responsibility to provide both 
strategic oversight and appropriate guidance to 
ensure the Company is able to create stakeholder 
value over the long term.
Dear shareholder
This is my final governance report because, 
as reported on page 6, I will be stepping 
down from the Board at the forthcoming 
Annual General Meeting in May. Since 
joining the Board back in 2007 , and then 
becoming Chairman in 2014, I have seen 
significant changes across the Company. 
We have made great progress in many 
areas, but we recognise that further 
improvements within our governance 
framework and internal controls can always 
be achieved. As a company, Petrofac is 
facing challenging times but it remains a 
key priority for the Board to continue to 
strive to do what is best for our Company, 
our clients, and our shareholders.
Board oversight
As a Board, it is our responsibility to provide 
strategic management oversight and 
appropriate guidance, where necessary, to 
ensure the Company is able to create and 
sustain stakeholder value over the long 
term. This can be achieved by ensuring that 
appropriate information, on all key matters 
affecting the Group, is duly considered and 
that material risks and opportunities are 
identified and discussed both at Board and 
senior management level. Throughout the

CORPORATE STRUCTURE AND FRAMEWORK
The Board is now assisted by four 
committees – Audit, Nominations, 
Remuneration and Compliance  
and Ethics.
Each Committee is responsible for 
reviewing and overseeing activities within  
its particular terms of reference (copies of 
which are available on the Company’s 
website, www.petrofac.com). The 
chairman of each committee provides a 
summary at each scheduled Board 
meeting of any committee meeting held 
since the previous meeting and, once 
approved, the minutes of all committee 
meetings are circulated to the full Board. 
Individual reports from each committee 
chairman for 2017 are provided on pages  
80 to 105.
In addition to these Board committees,  
the Company has a number of executive 
management committees, which are 
involved in the day-to-day operational 
management of Petrofac and have been 
established to consider various matters  
for recommendation to the Board and  
its committees.

Governance Corporate Governance 
compliance
Good corporate governance is an essential 
foundation for any company. It sets the 
tone as to how the Company operates  
and behaves, both internally and externally. 
It also defines the relationship between the 
Board, senior management, employees 
and other stakeholders.
The UK Corporate Governance Code
Petrofac, with a premium listing on the 
London Stock Exchange, is required  
under the UKLA Listing Rules to comply 
with the provisions of the UK Corporate 
Governance Code 2016 (UK Code).  
The UK Code underpins the corporate 
governance framework for premium listed 
companies and sets out a number of  
main principles of good governance,  
with compliance with the UK Code resting 
with the Board. The UK Code is publicly 
available at www.frc.org.uk.
Each year, through this governance report, 
we describe how the Company has 
complied with the UK Code principles and 
provisions during the period under review, 
in line with the ‘comply or explain’ model 
and detail any departures from any specific 
provisions. The Board considers that the 
Company complied in all material aspects 
with respect to the Code for the full year  
to 31 December 2017 . The Company’s 
auditor, Ernst & Young LLP (EY), are 
required to review whether the Corporate 
Governance report reflects the Company’s 
compliance with the principles of the UK 
Code specified for their review by the 
UKLA Listing Rules, and to report if it does 
not reflect such compliance. No such 
report of non-compliance has been made.
Leadership
Board organisation
We believe the governance framework,  
set out on page 67 , underpins good 
governance practices and enables the 
Board to provide effective stewardship of 
the Company. The Board is responsible  
for setting the Company’s strategic aims 
and providing leadership and guidance  
to achieve its objectives.
Our Chairman is primarily responsible for 
the leadership and effectiveness of the 
Board, whilst maintaining a clear structure 
that permits the Board to both challenge 
and support management. He is 
accountable for promoting effective board 
relationships and the participation of all 
board members, to encourage a culture  
of openness and debate and to enable  
the Board to fulfil all aspects of its role.  
It is essential that all Directors see the 
Chairman as fair and impartial. The 
relationships between the Chairman and 
the Group Chief Executive and the Senior 
Independent Director (SID) are of particular 
importance, as these three individuals 
represent the views of management and 
Non-executive Directors, respectively.
The Group Chief Executive is responsible 
for leadership and day-to-day management 
of the Group and for the design and 
execution of Company strategy. He is 
supported by his senior management 
team, whose details are outlined on pages 
24 and 25. Together they are responsible 
for proposing, developing and 
implementing the Company’s overall 
strategy, driving execution, growing 
markets and the client-base and 
developing our people. Regular meetings 
between the Chairman and Group Chief 
Executive are held both before and after 
scheduled Board meetings. These 
meetings allow general matters to be 
discussed and enable them to reach a 
mutual understanding of each other’s 
views, especially in matters where they 
may not be in agreement.
The SID is available to shareholders to 
answer any questions or concerns that 
cannot be addressed by either the 
Chairman or the Group Chief Executive 
and is also available to gather the opinions 
and views of the Non-executive Directors. 
The SID also provides additional support 
to, and acts as a sounding board for, the 
Chairman on board-related matters and 
additionally reviews the effectiveness of the 
Chairman as part of the annual Board 
evaluation. The Chairman and SID maintain 
regular contact between scheduled Board 
meetings and time is also set aside at each 
meeting for the Chairman to meet with the 
Non-executive Directors without the 
presence of management.
During the year, Thomas Thune Andersen 
stepped down as SID, following his 
notification to the Board of his intention  
to leave at the end of the year. He was 
replaced by René Médori, who became  
SID with effect from 1 September 2017 .  
As noted in Rijnhard van Tets’ letter on 
page 66, following Rijnhard’s departure 
from the Board, René will assume 
Chairmanship of the Company at the  
end of the 2018 Annual General Meeting, 
and Matthias Bichsel will assume the  
role of SID.
The combination of these meetings 
ensures that the Chairman is equally 
informed about the views of both  
Executive Directors, representing senior 
management, and Non-executive 
Directors, which assists in the setting of 
Board meeting agendas and ensures all 
Directors contribute through their individual 
and collective experiences. Each of our 
Directors has a varied career history and 
considerable effort has been taken to 
ensure that the Board has the right balance 
of skills, diversity and industry expertise. 
Our Non-executive Directors are 
encouraged to share their skills and 
experience and each is well positioned to 
support management, whilst providing 
constructive challenge.

Governance In October 2017 , the Board also visited the 
Aberdeen office. During this trip they met 
with the management team and received 
presentations from graduates and emerging 
talent on three key areas for the EPS West 
business unit. The Board also had the 
opportunity to visit the Petrofac Emergency 
Response Centre. As part of this trip, 
Andrea Abt and Alastair Cochran 
completed their Basic Offshore Training 
(BOSIET) at the Petrofac Training facility  
in Aberdeen, which allowed them, along 
with Rijnhard van Tets and other senior 
management, to visit the FPF-1 floating 
production facility, operated by us for Ithaca.
Board appointment and selection
The Company has a formal, rigorous  
and transparent selection procedure  
for the appointment of new Directors.  
The Nominations Committee, whose 
membership is set out on page 80, 
carefully considers Board composition 
throughout the year to ensure the right 
balance and mix of directors, taking into 
account their experience, skills and 
diversity. Care is taken to understand the 
existing external commitments of all 
Non-executive Directors, who, on 
appointment, are each made aware of the 
need to allocate sufficient time to the 
Company to discharge their responsibilities 
effectively. Any changes to a Director’s 
external commitments following 
appointment must be notified to the Board 
immediately in order that any potential 
conflict of interest, time commitment 
challenge or residency status issues can 
be considered. A detailed report on the 
activities of the Nominations Committee  
is provided on pages 80 and 81.
Re-appointment of Directors
In line with the UK Code, all Directors, 
subject to continued satisfactory 
performance, seek re-appointment by 
shareholders at each AGM. Both our 
Executive Directors have rolling service 
contracts, containing a notice period 
provision of 12 months’ by either party.  
In addition, Non-executive Directors have 
letters of appointment that contain a 
termination provision of three months’ 
notice by either party. The terms and 
conditions of appointment of all Directors 
are available for inspection by anyone at 
our registered office in Jersey and at our 
corporate services office in London. These 
documents are also made available for 
inspection during the 30 minutes prior to 
Board meetings
As a company incorporated in Jersey under 
the Companies (Jersey) Law 1991, we 
endeavour to hold at least half of our physical 
Board meetings in Jersey each year. At 
meetings that are held outside Jersey, we 
arrange, where feasible, for the Board to be 
given the opportunity to meet with 
employees, clients, suppliers and partners, 
as it is felt this allows the Board to gain a 
wider understanding of Petrofac. As well as 
the scheduled face-to-face meetings that are 
arranged each year, the Board also meets 
telephonically to review any items of business 
that need to be addressed before the next 
physical meeting. Dedicated strategy days, 
as well as site visits, also form part of our 
annual programme of events. This year 
seven physical meetings were held, in 
addition to a number of ad hoc telephonic 
meetings that took place as a result of the 
SFO investigation.
The Company’s scheduled Board meetings 
are generally held over two days, where 
active debate is encouraged before any 
Board decisions are taken. All Directors are 
encouraged to be open and forthright in their 
approach. We believe this boardroom culture 
helps to forge strong working relationships, 
whilst enabling Directors to engage fully with 
the Company, and allowing them to make 
their best possible contribution.
To enhance their knowledge of the 
business further and allow the Board to see 
the implementation of agreed strategy in 
action, members of operational and 
functional management, one and two tiers 
below director level, are usually invited to 
attend and present at certain Board and 
Committee meetings. It is felt these 
presentations also enable Directors  
to deepen their understanding of Petrofac 
at both a local and functional level, while 
gaining an awareness of specific nuances 
which may not always be obvious within 
written reports. Management is also given 
the opportunity to meet the Directors 
informally during the year as the Board 
believes these meetings to be valuable  
for personal development. During their  
trips to India and Aberdeen in 2017 , the 
Non-executive Directors were given the 
opportunity to meet graduates and 
employees considered to be ‘emerging 
talent’, thereby providing them with the 
chance to speak with individuals who  
they would not ordinarily encounter.  
These meetings also gave employees  
the opportunity to present to and speak 
openly with Board members.
Board site visit
Each year the Board aims to visit a Petrofac 
project site in conjunction with one of its 
scheduled meetings. We believe this gives 
Directors the opportunity to gain a deeper 
understanding of our operations, and to 
recognise some of the challenges being 
faced on a day-to-day basis by our 
employees, in what can sometimes be 
difficult and remote locations. 
In January 2017 , the Board and members 
of senior management travelled to India, 
visiting both the Chennai and Mumbai 
offices. During the trip, they met with 
engineering teams and graduates and 
received project progress and country 
update presentations from senior 
management from all three of our Indian 
offices, including the New Delhi office.

Effectiveness
Role of the Board
The UK Companies Act 2006 sets out a 
number of general duties to which all 
directors are expected to adhere. As a 
Jersey incorporated company, Petrofac is 
not required to comply with this legislation; 
nevertheless, our Directors are informed by 
UK practice and, in any event, act in good 
faith to promote the long-term success of 
the Company for the benefit of our 
shareholders and other stakeholders.  
The Board has been structured to ensure 
that no single individual can dominate the 
decision-making processes and we believe 
all Directors are able to work together in an 
atmosphere of openness, trust and mutual 
respect. As a unitary Board, our Directors 
share equal responsibility for all decisions, 
with Directors collectively responsible for 
the strategic direction of the Company.  
It is felt that having an effective working 
relationship between our Executive and 
Non-executive Directors provides a robust 
governance framework, which is essential 
for the progression towards the Company’s 
strategic aims.
Information and support
As part of our commitment to best 
practice, and as recommended by the UK 
Code, we endeavour to provide information 
to the Board in a timely manner and in a 
form and of a quality appropriate to enable 
it to discharge its duties effectively. Papers 
are provided electronically through a 
dedicated secure application, giving 
Directors instant access to papers, as well 
as additional reference documentation. A 
tailored approach to developing agendas is 
adopted for each meeting, with the majority 
of each agenda comprising non-recurring 
items, such as strategic matters or project 
specific and investment related 
opportunities. Operational and financial 
matters are reviewed and discussed at 
each meeting. We believe the flexibility of 
this approach allows Directors to engage 
effectively and encourages scrutiny and 
constructive debate, with Non-executive 
Directors able to seek clarification from 
management where required. Any actions 
arising from meetings are overseen by the 
Company Secretariat and updated action 
lists inform the agenda for the next 
scheduled meeting.
Director development and training
The Company does not run a ‘one-size-fits 
all’ training programme for Directors but is 
committed to providing continuing personal 
development training opportunities, tailored 
to each individual. The Company provides 
Directors with the necessary resources to 
maintain and enhance their knowledge and 
capabilities. They are all encouraged to 
regularly update and refresh their skills and 
keep up to date with any relevant regulatory 
developments, and to attend any pertinent 
external seminars run by professional 
advisors. During 2017 , Directors received 
training through a mixture of formal and 
informal seminars.
All Directors are also required to complete 
the Company’s e-learning training 
modules, which include: the Code of 
Conduct; Share Dealing Code; Anti-Bribery 
and Corruption Standard; and Health and 
Safety Training. Training records for 
Directors are maintained and these are 
reviewed during the annual evaluation 
process. Over the course of 2017 , more 
than 160 hours of training were recorded.
All Directors have access to executive 
management and further information,  
as is needed, to discharge their duties  
and responsibilities fully and effectively. 
Members of management present to  
the Board and Committees on a range  
of operating and commercial matters, 
allowing closer interaction between 
Directors and management. All Directors 
are entitled to seek independent 
professional advice concerning the  
affairs of the Company at the  
Company’s expense.
As mentioned on page 74, to deepen 
Directors’ understanding and knowledge of 
Petrofac and its operations, the Board 
undertook site visits to our Chennai, 
Mumbai and Aberdeen offices during the 
year. Directors are also encouraged to visit 
other sites either individually or as part of 
their general induction programme and 
consequently a number of separate site 
visits have been organised for individual 
members of the Board, including trips to 
Algeria, Kuwait, Oman and Saudi Arabia.
Evaluation of Board effectiveness
The Board understands the benefits of 
annual performance evaluations and the 
process is seen as an important means  
of monitoring progress against areas 
previously identified for improvement.  
The Board believes these evaluations  
can provide a valuable opportunity to 
highlight recognised strengths and identify 
any weaknesses, thereby improving 
effectiveness and driving improvements.
At the end of 2016, in accordance with the 
UK Code, the Board engaged the services of 
Mr John de Leeuw, an independent facilitator 
with no other connection to the Group, to 
conduct an externally facilitated evaluation.  
A final report, including recommendations, 
was prepared and submitted to the Board for 
discussion and consideration in early 201 7 .
Following this external evaluation, the 
Chairman led an internal review at the end  
of 201 7 , which consisted of one-to-one 
interviews with each Director and the 
Secretary to the Board and the completion of 
a detailed questionnaire focusing on matters 
such as performance, interaction, dynamics 
and Board Committee performance. This 
rigorous process enabled the Chairman to 
assess individuals’ performance and 
contribution, and identify development areas 
for individuals and the Board as a whole. 
The overall outcome of the evaluation 
process was positive, albeit it was 
acknowledged that the year had been 
dominated by the SFO investigation. As a 
result of this exercise, the Board is satisfied 
that it is operating effectively, with each 
Director performing well in respect of their 
roles on the Board and its Committees.  
As well as confirming where improvements 
have been made, the evaluation identified 
areas of focus for 2018. The results of the 
most recent evaluation process were 
presented to the Board in February 2018.
It is recognised that the Chairman’s 
effectiveness is also vital to that of the 
Board. Accordingly, led by René Médori as 
SID, an evaluation of Rijnhard van Tets was 
carried out. René consulted with each of the 
other Directors for input and feedback on 
Rijnhard’s performance during the year.  
The outcome of the evaluation was reported 
back to the Chairman and it was confirmed 
to the Board that Rijnhard’s Board 
leadership continued to be effective.

AREAS  
OF FOCUS  
FOR 2018
Areas of focus for 2018
Strategy: Board meetings to allocate 
sufficient time for medium and longer-
term strategic discussions. Consideration 
to be given to the digital agenda, 
including the innovative and technological 
developments being seen across  
the sector. 
Succession planning: Clear 
succession plans to be established for 
the Board and senior management team, 
ensuring diversity, in its widest sense, is 
taken into consideration as we look to 
develop employees for long-term 
succession.
Compliance and risk management: 
The approach to risk to be further 
developed, with the Group’s compliance 
framework strengthened, to ensure it is 
followed consistently across the business. 
Ensure the risks and challenges which 
may affect the business are included  
on each agenda to assist in decision-
making processes.
Culture and values: Ensure the 
Company values, and the behaviours 
associated with them, are clearly 
understood and consistently applied 
across the Group.
Improvement areas identified
In addition to considering the results of this 
year’s evaluation, the Directors reviewed 
progress against the targets previously 
identified where the Board might improve  
and these are set out below:
Strategy: Plan “deep dives” into key 
areas to help to define and determine a 
more focused strategic agenda. Develop  
a roadmap for the future in terms of both 
business direction and geographical 
focus. Identify insights into innovation, 
market and technological developments. 
Consider what is needed to introduce 
organisational and cultural change  
across the Group.
Risk management: Develop risk 
management processes further, to ensure 
they remain operationally effective. Ensure 
the Board is aligned on the key risks 
identified during the evaluation process 
and that the necessary mitigating 
strategies are in place.
Succession planning: Determine the 
capabilities and competencies required 
both on the Board and within the senior 
management team to embark successfully 
on the agreed strategic journey. Evaluate 
and encourage greater interaction 
between meetings.
Financial planning: Maintain a firm focus 
on cash generation, working capital 
management and reducing capital 
intensity, whilst retaining a continuous 
emphasis on project planning and 
implementation.
Director induction
Our induction process is intended to provide 
a broad introduction to the Group. 
Individually tailored induction programmes 
are prepared for each new appointee, which 
is considered to be the optimal approach. 
This allows the Company to account for 
differing requirements and to concentrate  
on key focus areas, to ensure that each 
Director is fully prepared for their new role, 
taking their background and experience into 
consideration. All new appointees spend 
time with each of the Executive Directors as 
well as senior members of operational and 
functional management, both individually 
and collectively. Detailed briefings are also 
provided in order that they may quickly gain 
a deeper understanding of Petrofac at an 
operational level. A comprehensive induction 
pack, which contains a wide range of 
materials, is provided to each new Director 
prior to them joining the Board. Each new 
Director also attends a compulsory 
presentation led by our external legal 
advisors on the role and responsibilities of 
being a UK-listed company director and, 
depending on which committees they  
will join, presentations are provided by  
the Group auditors and remuneration 
consultants. Visits to operational sites and 
offices are also actively encouraged, either 
as part of scheduled Board meetings or as 
independent trips. 
As set out in our Nominations Committee 
report on pages 80 and 81, Sara Akbar 
joined the Board on 1 January 2018.  
A detailed programme is being arranged 
for her to be completed during the course 
of 2018. 
Dealing with potential conflicts  
of interest
Processes and procedures are in place in 
the event that any potential conflict arises 
during a term of appointment. Where such 
conflicts arise, Directors are required to 
identify and declare any actual or potential 
conflict of interest, whether matter-specific 
or situational, with notifications required to 
be made by the Director concerned prior 
to, or at, a Board meeting. All Directors 
have a duty to update the whole Board  
of any changes in personal circumstances. 
The Company’s Articles of Association 
permit the Board to authorise conflicts 
which can be limited in scope and, during 
2017 , all conflict management procedures 
were adhered to, managed and  
reported effectively.
THE DIRECTORS’ PERFORMANCE EVALUATION CYCLE
76 / Petrofac Annual report and accounts 2017
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE REPORT 
CONTINUED The Company also has procedures in 
place for Directors to have access to 
independent external advice at the 
Company’s expense, where they judge  
it necessary in order to discharge  
their responsibilities.
Deeds of indemnity
In accordance with our Articles of 
Association, and to the maximum extent 
permitted by Jersey law, all Directors and 
Officers of Petrofac Limited are provided 
with deeds of indemnity in respect of 
liabilities that may be incurred as a result  
of their office. In addition, Petrofac has 
appropriate insurance coverage in respect 
of legal action that may be brought against 
its Directors and Officers. Neither the 
Company’s indemnities nor insurance 
would provide any cover where a Director 
or Officer was found to have acted 
fraudulently or dishonestly.
Remuneration
Directors’ remuneration
All remuneration matters for the Chairman, 
Executive Directors and key members of 
senior management are determined by  
the Remuneration Committee, whose 
membership is set out on page 90. 
Responsibility for setting the remuneration 
payable to the Non-executive Directors 
resides with the full Board, albeit 
independent external advice is taken. 
Non-executive Directors’ fees are reviewed 
each year and further details are provided 
on page 99. A detailed report on the 
activities carried out by the Remuneration 
Committee is provided on pages 90 to 101.
Accountability
Risk management and system  
of internal control
The Board is responsible for monitoring and 
reviewing the effectiveness of Petrofac’s risk 
management and systems of internal 
control. Regular management reports are 
received throughout the year, which outline 
the Group’s material enterprise risks. 
Additional reports are also received from 
the internal and external auditors and Group 
Compliance to assist the Audit Committee, 
and ultimately the Board, in their annual 
assessment of the effectiveness of the 
Group’s risk management and system  
of internal control.
The process of risk identification is both 
top-down and bottom-up. This ensures 
management are able to review and 
challenge impacts and mitigations at each 
level of the organisation, addressing the 
risks for which they are organisationally 
responsible. The Group’s Key Risk Register 
(KRR) aims to identify the principal risks 
facing the organisation and evaluates the 
likelihood of incidence and impact on the 
Group, if such risks were to materialise.  
The KRR enables the Board to assess  
and monitor the existence and likely 
effectiveness of the actions that are 
planned to manage and mitigate such 
risks, in order to avoid or reduce the impact 
of the underlying risk.
To facilitate the year-end process, the  
Audit Committee has the responsibility  
of assessing a detailed review of risk 
management and internal control 
processes. This is done in order to provide 
formal assurance to the Board on the 
robustness, integrity and effectiveness of 
these systems and controls in relation to 
the Group’s principal risks, including those 
which may threaten the Group’s strategy, 
business model, future performance, 
solvency and liquidity. The processes 
reviewed enable the Board to consider the 
risk management and system of internal 
controls in place. The Board is satisfied that 
sound risk management and systems of 
internal controls have been in place across 
the Group throughout 2017 and as at the 
date when the 2017 financial statements  
were approved.
Petrofac also seeks to ensure that a  
sound system of internal controls, based 
on the Group’s policies and guidelines,  
is in place in all material associate and  
joint arrangement entities. As with all 
companies, our systems of internal control 
and risk management are designed to 
identify, mitigate and manage rather than 
eliminate business risk and can only ever 
provide reasonable, and not absolute, 
assurance against material financial 
misstatement or fraud.
A detailed report on the activities of the 
Audit Committee is provided on pages  
82 to 87 .
Code of Conduct and Speak Up
The newly formed Compliance and Ethics 
Committee is now responsible for reviewing 
the adequacy and effectiveness of the 
Group’s compliance activities, which 
include the Company’s Speak Up Policy. 
Further details of our Code of Conduct are 
provided on page 64. The Compliance and 
Ethics Committee reviews the status of all 
investigations conducted as a result of any 
alleged Code breaches received during the 
year, and will liaise, as required, with the 
Audit Committee, in the event the alleged 
breach is of a financial nature. Further 
details on the Company’s Speak Up 
activities are set out on page 65.
Security
During the course of the year, the Board 
considered and discussed the continuing 
challenges faced in certain regions and 
international security as a result of trans-
national terrorism. Petrofac’s Security 
function presented plans to continue 
ensuring the safest possible travel and 
workplace for our staff. At the same time,  
in view of strained economic situations in 
many of our core territories, an initiative to 
reinforce security awareness, in low and 
medium risk environments, was put in 
place to mitigate expected rises in criminal 
activity often associated with increased 
austerity. As a result of this work, all 
projects have identified and trained a 
Security Focal Point to champion basic 
measures that protect the Company’s staff 
and assets.
Crisis management
A crisis management improvement 
programme was initiated during 2017 ,  
with particular focus on Business 
Continuity Management and Digital Media 
Response. The next stage of development 
will see improvements being made to  
our suite of crisis management standards  
and operational guidelines, along with 
associated training and exercises for all 
three tiers of our Emergency Response  
& Crisis Management (ERCM) command 
and control structure.

NTMS Investments Limited 18,134,399 5.24%
Tosca Fund 17,990,073 5.20%
As at the date of this report, Deutsche Bank AG had notified the Company, in accordance with DTR5, that their interests in ordinary 
shares had decreased below 5%.
Referral to Serious Fraud Office (SFO)
The Company reported in last year’s 
Annual Report and Accounts that in August 
2016, the Company had announced that  
it had concluded an internal independent 
investigation commissioned by the Board 
into allegations in the media during 2016 
that related to the historical provision  
of services to the Company by Unaoil,  
a Monaco based company. The Board 
considered it appropriate to share the 
findings of this internal investigation with  
the Serious Fraud Office (SFO), in response 
to the SFO’s general request for information 
in relation to its ongoing investigation into 
the activities of Unaoil.
On 12 May 2017 , the Company was notified 
by the SFO that it had commenced an 
investigation into Petrofac, its subsidiaries 
and their officers, employees and agents. 
On the same day, Ayman Asfari and 
Marwan Chedid were arrested by the SFO, 
questioned under caution and released 
without charge. On 25 May 2017 , the 
Company subsequently announced a 
number of decisions that had been put in 
place to ensure Petrofac could retain its 
focus on its operations and clients, whilst 
also ensuring the Company was able to 
continue to engage with the SFO’s 
investigation. This included the restriction  
to his operational duties for Mr Asfari and 
the suspension of Mr Chedid as Group 
Chief Operating Officer. As a consequence 
of this, Mr Chedid resigned from the  
Board with immediate effect. 
During this time, the membership of an 
existing sub-committee of the Board, 
originally established to oversee the internal 
investigation in 2016, was expanded.  
The remit of this new expanded sub-
committee was to be solely responsible for 
the Company’s engagement with the SFO 
and to oversee the Company’s response  
to the investigation. This sub-committee 
comprised the Chairman, all Non-executive 
Directors and the Chief Financial Officer. 
Given the scale of the SFO investigation,  
this committee also engaged a senior 
external specialist to oversee the Company’s 
management of, and response to, the  
SFO investigation. 
Petrofac is responding as constructively  
as possible to the SFO investigation,  
noting that the SFO also has access to 
other information in the context of its wider 
investigation. The consequences of this 
SFO investigation will be determined by  
the regulatory authorities and therefore 
Petrofac is unable to predict their outcome, 
although these could include the 
prosecution of the Company and of 
individuals. As a result, the potential for 
fines, penalties or other consequences, 
including reputational damage and an 
exclusion from bidding on certain 
contracts, cannot currently be assessed. 
As the SFO investigation is ongoing, it is 
not yet possible to identify the timescale 
when these matters may be concluded.
Relations with shareholders
Shareholder engagement
The Board acknowledges its responsibility 
to promote the success of Petrofac to its 
many stakeholders. Petrofac encourages 
open and constructive engagement with 
shareholders as we believe that effective 
dialogue is key to understanding 
shareholders’ views.
Shareholder sentiment has continued to be 
an area of significant focus during the year, 
particularly in light of the share price 
volatility experienced during 2017 . 
Discussions with our corporate brokers 
have been held to further understand 
market pressures and to gain insight into 
governance matters, in general, and 
succession planning in particular, from a 
shareholder perspective. The Chairman 
and Non-executive Directors each engage 
with our shareholders as and when 
required, while the Group Chief Executive 
and Chief Financial Officer maintain a 
regular dialogue with institutional 
shareholders through a programme of 
one-to-one and other meetings throughout 
the year, focusing on operational matters. 
Our Investor Relations team acts as a focal 
point for contact with investors throughout 
the year and brokers’ research notes are 
regularly circulated to all Directors. A formal 
broker’s report is circulated to Directors in 
advance of each Board meeting.
A programme of meetings with both 
existing and potential shareholders, as  
well as analyst and investor meetings, is 
scheduled each year by our Investor 
Relations team. This programme includes 
presentations to institutional investors and 
research analysts, as well as question and 
answer sessions with stakeholders

Shareholder communications
Considerable emphasis is placed on 
communications with shareholders, 
whether they are institutional or private 
shareholders. Accordingly, financial reports 
and shareholder documents, regulatory 
market announcements, together with 
recorded interviews, are all available on  
our website, which we believe allows 
shareholders to become more  
informed investors.
Share capital
As at the date of this report, the  
Company’s issued share capital consisted 
of 345,912,7 47 ordinary shares, carrying one 
vote each. The total voting rights at the date 
of this report are accordingly 345,912,7 47 . 
The Company’s ordinary shares are quoted 
on the London Stock Exchange.
There are no restrictions on the transfer  
of ordinary shares in the capital of the 
Company other than certain restrictions 
which may, from time to time, be imposed 
by law, for example, insider trading 
regulations. In accordance with the EU 
Market Abuse Regulation certain Company 
employees, including all Directors, are 
required to seek approval from the 
Company to deal in its securities. The 
Company is not aware of any agreements 
between shareholders that may result in 
restrictions on the transfer of securities 
and/or voting rights.
The Directors require express authorisation 
from shareholders to issue or purchase 
ordinary shares in the Company. These 
authorities were granted by shareholders  
at the 2017 AGM. The Group has no 
current plans to exercise either of these 
authorities and will propose to renew them 
at the 2018 AGM.
The Company’s Articles of Association  
may only be amended by special resolution 
at a general meeting of shareholders. 
Details relating to the rights and obligations 
attaching to the Company’s ordinary 
shares are set out in the Company’s 
Articles of Association.
Annual General Meeting (AGM)
Full details of this year’s AGM, which will be 
held in London, are set out in the Notice of 
Meeting which accompanies this report 
and which is also available on our website. 
As a matter of good practice, all resolutions 
will be conducted on a poll and the results 
will be announced to the market as soon 
as possible after the meeting. All 
shareholders are invited to attend the 
Company’s AGM at which they have the 
opportunity to put questions to the Board 
and meet with those Directors who are 
able to attend. Shareholders who are 
unable to attend the AGM are invited to 
email questions in advance at 
agmquestions@petrofac.com.
I look forward to seeing as many of you  
as possible at my final AGM as Chairman, 
when my colleagues and I will be available 
to answer your questions.

Governance Dear shareholder
2017 has proven to be very busy for the Committee and, over the 
course of the year, a core focus has been on succession planning 
both at Board and senior management level. This was coupled 
with reviewing the composition of the Board and its Committees. 
In addition, as a result of the senior management changes which 
were effected in May, the Company undertook a Groupwide 
functional reorganisation programme commencing in June 2017 . 
This programme resulted in the Committee devoting considerable 
time to discussing both long and short-term management plans to 
ensure that the proposed and implemented changes could be 
managed effectively and efficiently.
Board changes
Following commencement of the Serious Fraud Office 
investigation, as detailed further on page 78, Marwan Chedid was 
suspended as Chief Operating Officer on 25 May 2017 . As a result, 
he resigned from the Board. During his five years on the Board, 
Marwan contributed extensively to Board discussions and 
provided considerable industry and business knowledge for  
which the Board is appreciative. Separately, on 18 May 2017 ,  
Jane Sadowsky chose to step down from the Board.
Earlier in the year, and with a view of improving gender diversity 
and enhancing overall Board expertise, the Committee 
commenced an external search for a new Non-executive Director. 
To facilitate this process to identify potential new Board 
candidates, the Committee retained the services of specialist 
recruitment consultants, Korn Ferry. The Committee confirms that 
the Company has no relationship with Korn Ferry that extends 
beyond executive searches for Board and senior management 
positions. The Board was pleased to announce the appointment 
of Sara Akbar, who joined the Board as a Non-executive Director 
with effect from 1 January 2018. Sara is very experienced within 
the oil and gas industry and has significant operational and project 
management capabilities. She brings to the boardroom a unique 
insight into the Middle East environment, along with wide-ranging 
international experience, and the Board looks forward to working 
with Sara in the years to come. In making any new appointment  
to the Board, the Committee considers the skills, industry 
experience, diversity and capabilities of the existing Directors and 
identifies potential candidates who would best contribute to 
maintaining a strong Board with complementary skills and 
experience. This ensures a highly competent Board that is 
effective and efficient to support Petrofac’s future plans.
On 30 August 2017 with the publication of the half-year results,  
the Company announced that Thomas Thune Andersen had 
indicated his intention to leave the Board by the end of the year.  
In preparation for this departure, he subsequently stepped down 
from his role as Senior Independent Director (SID), a role which 
was assumed by René Médori with effect from 1 September. 
Thomas formally stepped down from the Board on 31 December 
2017 after seven years’ service. During his tenure, Thomas led the 
Remuneration Committee effectively and contributed significantly 
to the Board. On its behalf, I would like to thank him for his 
support, especially in recent times, and for being a valued  
member of the Board.

NOMINATIONS COMMITTEE REPORT As a result of Thomas’ departure and Sara’s appointment,  
the Committee took the opportunity to review and refresh the 
composition of each Board Committee at the start of 2018. 
Consequently, having served on the Remuneration Committee for 
over two years, Matthias Bichsel replaced Thomas as Chairman  
of that Committee, and is joined by Sara Akbar as a member.  
Ms Akbar was also appointed as a member of this Committee 
with effect from 1 January 2018. Further details of current 
memberships are set out on pages 68 and 69.
As mentioned in my Chairman’s Statement on page 6, I will be 
stepping down from the Board in May 2018 having served as a 
Director for 1 1 years, over three of which as Chairman. Having 
notified the Committee of my intentions, a process was initiated to 
consider candidates with appropriate capabilities, knowledge, and 
experience. The Company subsequently announced in December 
2017 that René Médori, our current Senior Independent Director 
(SID), would be my successor and I am pleased to note that René 
will take over the role of Chairman at the conclusion of our AGM  
in May 2018, with Matthias Bichsel assuming the role of SID  
on the same date.
Succession planning
During the year, the Committee dedicated over a third of its time 
reviewing and discussing succession planning, both on the Board 
and at senior management level, and a further third discussing key 
organisational changes and people development. This reflects the 
importance the Committee places on these matters and ensured 
that unexpected changes could be managed without significant 
disruption to the Group’s strategy or day-to-day operations. A full 
breakdown of how the Committee spent its time during 2017  
is set out on page 72.
The progression of our emerging talent is reviewed on an annual 
basis, not only to check that appropriate processes are in place to 
identify and monitor future potential leaders, but also to allow the 
Committee to discuss such individuals. One of the Company’s 
principal objectives is to build a strong talent pipeline and a key 
focus has been to develop employee skills and capability for the 
future. Our Graduate Development Programme was implemented 
in 2004 and whilst intake numbers have reduced in recent years, 
due to the unfavourable external market, over 50% of those 
graduates hired since 2014 have been retained within the Group. 
The Committee maintained active oversight of the Group’s 
functional capability during 2017 and remains committed to 
ensuring the Company has the most suitable individuals in the 
correct roles to ensure process enhancements are implemented, 
and effective internal controls are applied. A functional review was 
also undertaken by the business during the second half of the year 
with the aim of strengthening overall governance and controls and 
improving consistency, quality and oversight of the key services 
provided across the Group.
Board evaluation
In compliance with the UK Code, this year’s Board evaluation 
exercise was internally facilitated. Full details of the process and 
outcome of this evaluation process are set out on page 75 and 76.
Diversity
As noted above, we were pleased to welcome a new female 
Non-executive Director to the Board at the start of 2018. The 
appointment of Sara Akbar means that our female representation 
on the Board is now 25%. While we recognise this remains slightly 
below the 33% target recommendation set out in the 2017 
Hampton-Alexander Review to achieve by 2020, progress has 
been made towards this goal and with increasing overall diversity 
awareness. The Committee is keen to reinforce that, in 
accordance with the Group’s Diversity and Inclusion Policy, it gives 
due regard to the balance of existing skills, knowledge, experience 
and diversity for all Board appointments. It remains keen to ensure 
that any appointment be filled by the best available candidate, 
whose capabilities and background addresses the Board’s needs, 
irrespective of any other consideration.
Despite engineering continuing to be a predominantly male-
dominated profession, the Company is committed to building its 
diversity pipeline from the bottom up and this continues to be a 
long-term plan. While there remain fewer women than men in 
senior engineering roles generally, and recognising the leadership 
and pipeline recommendations published in the 2017 Hampton-
Alexander Review, the Company remains committed to building 
and developing our female talent pipeline. Women currently 
account for 1 1% of our total workforce, with 18% representing our 
workforce below age 30 and 6% over the age of 50. We believe it 
is therefore imperative that work continues to retain and improve 
the higher gender ratios throughout the career lifecycle.
A Diversity and Inclusion Policy has been in place across the 
Group since August 2016. This is applicable to all employees and 
its aim is to ensure equality of opportunity and fairness in all areas 
of employment. Our policy is regularly reviewed to ensure equality 
of opportunity and fairness in all areas of employment. An 
e-learning training module on this policy was rolled out across the 
Group during 2016 to ensure full understanding and consistent 
application. It is believed that this policy allows us to value the 
diversity of our employees while promoting an inclusive culture 
across our business. Details of our Policy and current gender 
diversity statistics are set out on pages 51 and 69. 
Employee engagement
Towards the end of 2016, an online survey was issued to all 
employees and further details on the results of this PetroVoices 
survey are included on page 51. During the year the Committee 
discussed the themes arising from the survey and considered the 
variances between prior survey results. Progress has been made 
across the organisation during 2017 to respond to actions arising 
from the employee engagement survey and work will continue 
throughout 2018. Periodic updates have been provided through 
our internal employee communication channels and plans are in 
place to conduct a further survey during 2018.

Chairman of the  
Audit Committee
Dear shareholder
2017 has been a challenging year for Petrofac, not least because 
of the increased focus on compliance matters and related risk 
management and internal control activities. Throughout the year, 
the Committee supported the Board in considering adherence 
with these matters. In support of the Company’s strategic 
objective to focus on the core, the Committee also worked with 
senior management to ensure the historical lessons learned from 
operational and execution challenges could be embedded  
across the Group.
Petrofac continues to operate in challenging environments and  
it is essential that the Group maintains a defined and established 
system of risk management and internal control procedures.  
To this end, the Committee maintained a keen oversight on key 
areas of risk management and internal controls throughout the 
year. It is felt this will ensure that future growth can be supported 
by a developed and embedded risk management culture, which 
promotes sound business practices, even in tougher external 
environments. During the year, the Committee had responsibility 
for compliance oversight until the creation of the Compliance and 
Ethics Committee. Going forward, the Compliance and Ethics 
Committee will assume responsibility for compliance oversight, 
however the Committee will continue to be involved in any 
compliance matter raised in relation to financial controls.
Further progress was made during 2017 to develop the risk 
management processes and the internal controls framework,  
to ensure the Group could deliver its strategic objectives. The 
Committee is encouraged by the changing focus for internal 
control procedures and is supportive of the process improvements 
being introduced across the Group as a result of the work 
completed by both functional and operational management.  
The Committee is confident that these control enhancements  
will provide greater assurance and oversight of project risk 
throughout the organisation. 
As in previous years, the Committee was also focused on the 
integrity of the Group’s financial reporting activities. In considering 
the financial statements for 2017 , the Committee concentrated on 
revenue and margin recognition for significant contracts, cash flow 
management and the carrying value of our IES assets. The 
Committee concluded that management had adopted an 
appropriate approach in all significant areas.
The Committee will continue to work together with the Board  
and the other Board Committees to monitor and review the 
effectiveness of the Group’s risk management and internal control 
framework. In addition, focus will continue to ensure that the 
provisions of the UK Code continue to be met in all aspects.

AUDIT COMMITTEE REPORT The Committee met four times during the year, coinciding with key 
points in the Company’s financial reporting cycle. In May 2017 , 
Jane Sadowsky stepped down from the Board and, as a 
consequence, left the Committee. There are currently three 
members of the Committee and their details are set out on page 
69. The Committee believes it remains well positioned to challenge 
and debate the performance and relevance of the Group’s risk 
management and internal controls as well as the significant 
financial reporting judgements and estimates. As reported on 
page 81, this will be my last report as Committee Chairman,  
as I will be required to step down from the Committee when I take 
over the Company Chairmanship from Rijnhard at the end of the 
Annual General Meeting in May 2018. My successor will be David 
Davis, who (as noted on page 7) will join the Board in May 2018. 
Following his appointment, and in consultation with the 
Nominations Committee, the Committee will review its 
membership and any proposed recommendations will be 
submitted to the Board for consideration and approval.

Governance Activities during the year
The Committee assists the Board in the effective discharge of its 
responsibilities for financial reporting, internal control and risk 
management. As set out in our Directors’ statements on page 
106, the Directors are responsible for the preparation of Group 
and Company’s financial statements, in accordance with 
International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS).
The Group has an internal control and risk management 
framework in place, which includes policies and procedures to 
ensure that adequate accounting records are maintained and 
transactions are accurately recorded. This ensures that the Group 
and Company’s financial reports, including the integrity of the 
financial reporting process and communications to the market, 
give a clear and balanced assessment of the Group and 
Company’s financial performance and position. In addition to the 
principal matters considered during the year, as set out on page 
83, the Committee also reviewed the key judgements, estimates 
and other accounting matters concerning the 2017 Group and 
Company’s financial statements as well as the financial statements 
themselves and this Annual Report and Accounts, at the 
beginning of 2018.
Internal controls and risk management
The Board is responsible for establishing the Group’s overall risk 
appetite and retains overall responsibility for enterprise risk and  
for ensuring that the Group has in place an adequate system of 
internal control. However, in accordance with the requirements  
of the FRC’s Guidance on Risk Management, Internal Control  
and Related Financial and Business Reporting, the Committee  
has the delegated responsibility of monitoring and reviewing the 
integrity and effectiveness of the Group’s overall systems of risk 
management and internal controls. It also provides the Board  
with the assurance that risk management and internal control 
systems, as a whole and including strategic, financial, operational, 
and compliance controls, are sufficiently robust to mitigate the 
principal risks which may impact the Group.
The Group’s Key Risk Register (KRR) captures and assesses the 
principal risks facing the Group and this forms part of the Group’s 
framework for determining risk and risk appetite. This document is 
updated quarterly and highlights any recent movements in 
exposure, thereby allowing the Committee to recognise and 
review the mitigation and management of new or changing risks 
on a regular basis. The KRR is considered at both Committee and 
Board level throughout the year and further details are included 
within the Strategic Report on pages 26 to 33.
Regular management reports support robust assessments of  
the principal risks facing the Group, including their impacts on  
the enterprise and its future sustainability. In order to provide its 
assurance to the Board, the Committee receives regular updates 
from the Group Head of Enterprise Risk, Group Head of Internal 
Audit, Group Financial Controller, Group Treasurer and Head of 
Tax and Group Head of Compliance. Recognising the need for  
a systematic approach to be taken for managing risk, additional 
reports are also provided by senior management, including 
financial counterparty risk assessments, controls improvement 
plans, health and safety processes, security, and information 
technology. In reviewing each of the submitted reports, the 
Committee considers how effectively risks have been identified; 
how they have been mitigated and managed; whether actions are 
being taken promptly to remedy any failings or weaknesses; and 
whether the causes of the failing or weakness have indicated poor 
decision making or a need for more extensive monitoring or a 
reassessment of process effectiveness. These provide the 
Committee with a balanced assessment of the Group’s principal 
risks and the effectiveness of internal control systems.
The effectiveness of our risk management and internal controls is 
founded on our enterprise risk management (ERM) and internal 
control frameworks, which are further detailed on page 27 . During 
2017 , we continued to improve our risk management systems by 
introducing additional controls to our project risk review processes 
and we extended the risk reviews to ensure there is increased 
cross-management input. We enhanced our assurance process 
further for our E&C projects through the expansion and further 
development of a ‘stage-gate’ approach, with additional 
improvements introduced to project controls. Our risk 
management systems continue to evolve, with operational 
processes becoming more systematic, particularly within  
our E&C business unit.
During the year, the Company revised a number of compliance-
related controls, including the formation of a new Committee.  
The Compliance and Ethics Committee will have direct oversight 
of key compliance and ethical risks. It will now also be responsible 
for the Group’s Speak Up programme, working closely with this 
Committee in the event that concerns are raised in relation to 
alleged breaches of a financial nature. As a result, reports 
previously submitted to the Committee by the Group Head of 
Compliance will now be submitted for consideration by the 
Compliance and Ethics Committee. The Committee is content that 
the Compliance and Ethics Committee will monitor the Group’s 
compliance framework of controls effectively.
Internal audit
The Group Head of Internal Audit attends all Committee meetings, 
at which his reports are considered and discussed in detail. The 
Committee also meets separately with the Group Head of Internal 
Audit, without executive management being present, to discuss, 
among other matters, management’s responsiveness to internal 
audit recommendations and the effectiveness of the internal audit 
process. The Group Head of Internal Audit also has direct access 
to the Committee Chairman and meets with the external auditor 
whenever required.
The Group’s annual internal audit programme was considered  
and approved by the Committee in February 2017 . The risk-based 
programme was developed further during the year, taking into 
account the Group’s principal risks and identifying where they 
primarily occur in the business. In approving the audit programme, 
the Committee considered the Group’s principal key risk register 
and mapped the proposed audits accordingly. It was 
recommended that primary focus should remain on a number of 
key areas, including: overarching management controls such as 
the Enterprise Risk Management Process; controls designed to 
prevent non-compliance with laws and regulations; project level 
controls, such as bid preparation, engineering and contract 
management and financial controls; and IT security. Regular 
84 / Petrofac Annual report and accounts 2017
AUDIT COMMITTEE REPORT
CONTINUED progress reports were provided to the Committee, detailing key 
findings of audits undertaken in the period under review. Where 
significant areas of concern were highlighted, the Committee 
challenged management and, where required, action plans  
were agreed to address matters raised, with follow-up reviews 
arranged. During 2017 , 54 internal audit assignments were  
carried out. Where new audit findings were identified, agreed 
management actions in response to any Group level findings,  
were reported to the Committee, thus enabling progress to be 
monitored and any trends to be identified. Weaknesses identified 
included: gaps in the controls to manage the segregation of duties 
in the Group’s ERP system; incomplete compliance due diligence 
for some third parties; weaknesses in the facilities infrastructure 
within the UK and Sharjah IT data centres; and gaps within the 
financial assurance role in the budgeting and planning processes. 
These findings were carefully considered by the Committee,  
with management given direction to ensure the necessary steps 
were taken to mitigate any issues.
During 2016, and as previously reported, a sub-committee was 
established by the Board to oversee an internal independent 
investigation into allegations in the media relating to the historical 
provision of services to the Company by Unaoil. Following 
completion of this internal investigation in 2016, Group Internal 
Audit was tasked with assessing the adequacy of the current 
controls environment in relation to the management of the risk of 
bribery, corruption and/or fraud when contracting with third 
parties. The scope of this audit focused on the standards, policies 
and procedures designed to manage these risks in both high and 
low risk locations and a report on the outcome was submitted to 
the Committee in May 2017 . The scope of the initial audit was 
subsequently extended to include a review of existing policies,  
due diligence procedures as carried out on third parties working 
with, and for, the Company, and payment related processes, 
including invoice verification and oversight controls.
Reports on the work carried out by Internal Audit, which included 
a number of second line of defence assurance reviews, were 
delivered to the Committee throughout the course of the year, with 
Group, Region and Project level findings reported accordingly. 
To assist Group Compliance, Internal Audit was also requested  
to assist in the investigation of reports raised from the confidential 
whistleblowing line, especially where they related to alleged 
financial and internal control breaches. As noted above, the 
responsibility for the Company’s Speak Up process was 
transferred to the Compliance and Ethics Committee during  
the year and further details of the work completed in this regard 
are set out on page 89.
Assurance
At the year end, and as required by the UK Code, formal 
assurance is provided to the Board that effective governance,  
risk management and internal control processes are in place, to 
ensure that the Group will continue to be viable for at least the next 
three years. This assurance covers all material controls, including 
strategic, financial, operational and compliance controls. Further 
details on the overall control processes are set out on page 84.
Treasury
As part of its remit, the Committee considers the Company’s 
compliance with the Sovereign, Counterparty and Financial  
Market Risk (SFMR) policy, a copy of which is available at  
www.petrofac.com. This SFMR policy is monitored on a monthly 
basis by the Treasury Management Committee, which considers a 
number of risk exposures, including interest rate, foreign exchange 
rate, commodity pricing and counterparties, that could impact the 
Group. The Committee is satisfied that the existing policies remain 
appropriate. During the year, the Committee reviewed the financial 
risks associated with the liquidity of the Company. It was satisfied 
with the report from management that following completion of a 
number of scenarios, the Company had adequate resources in 
place to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future, 
with robust policies in place to manage Group solvency and 
liquidity risks. Commodity price risk and the Company’s hedging 
policy were kept under review throughout the year. The Committee 
noted the ongoing funding initiatives put in place during the year, 
including the utilisation or extension of existing facilities or the 
introduction of new facilities. The Committee was reassured that 
the Group Treasury team had implemented a global cash 
management project across the Group to centralise and reduce 
the cash held by individual businesses within the Group.
Insurance programme
The Petrofac global insurance programme incorporates insurance 
policies designed to cover the types of insurable risks associated 
with an oil field services provider. The primary focus of the insurance 
programme is to ensure that these policies will respond in line with 
our expectations and support our risk transfer philosophy.
During 2017 , several policies entered the final year of a two-year 
long-term agreement. The Company continued, however, to 
compare premium rates with the market generally, to ensure that 
terms remained the most competitive available. Key insurer 
relationships continued to be strengthened and policy limits, 
deductibles and wordings reviewed to ensure that the optimum 
balance remained between our potential insurable risk exposures, 
policy coverage and premium spend. For example, cover was 
extended under the Company’s energy policy to allow a 
standalone windstorm policy to be lapsed, without affecting 
coverage, but at a significant premium saving to the business. 
Claim scenario workshops continued during 2017 , which resulted 
in the incorporation of further wording enhancements into our 
existing programme. These workshops remain an integral part of 
the global insurance programme and greatly assist with gaining 
important insight into policy coverage and understanding how 
insurers are likely to respond to claims, based on hypothetical,  
but nonetheless realistic loss scenarios.

Governance Significant judgements
The Committee’s role is to assess whether the judgements or estimations made by management in preparing the financial statements 
are reasonable and appropriate. Set out below are what we consider to be the most significant accounting areas that required a high 
level of judgement or estimation during the year, and how these were addressed:
Focus area Why this area is significant Role of the Committee Conclusion
Revenue and 
margin recognition 
– including on 
fixed-price 
engineering, 
procurement and 
construction 
contracts; 
operations and 
maintenance; and 
Integrated Energy 
Services (IES) 
contractual 
arrangements
The quantification and timing of the 
recognition of revenue and margin from 
contracts, including fixed-priced 
engineering, procurement and construction; 
operations and maintenance, and IES 
arrangements, is an important driver of  
the reported business performance of  
the Group. There is a risk that revenue is 
inappropriately recognised, for instance, 
variable consideration that is not probable 
and/or cannot be measured reliably or cost 
to complete estimates that are inaccurate, 
which would lead to financial misstatement.
The Committee reviewed the reasonableness 
of judgements made regarding: the cost to 
complete estimates; the timing of recognition  
of variation orders; and the adequacy of 
contingency provisions to mitigate contract 
specific risks for projects where there have 
been significant delays and pursuance of  
a claim was possible. Consideration was  
also given to the assessments made in 
relation to the recognition of liquidated 
damage provisions.
The Committee held discussions with 
executive management and received regular 
internal audit reports into the operating 
effectiveness of internal controls relevant to 
these judgements. The external auditor also 
challenged management on the key drivers  
of revenue and margin recognition, with 
particular attention given to variation orders, 
cost-to-complete and liquidated damages, 
and reported their findings to the Committee.
The Committee 
concluded that the 
quantification and timing 
of revenue and margin 
recognition continues to 
be compliant with IFRS 
requirements and that  
the judgements made  
are reasonable. The 
Committee will continue 
to monitor this focus  
area going forward.
Goodwill, asset 
impairment and  
fair value changes 
in IES assets and 
JSD6000
It is important to assess regularly the 
appropriate carrying amount of the Group’s 
assets through a robust impairment testing 
process, particularly as the potential 
amounts involved are material to the Group’s 
reported net profit and financial position. 
Estimating the recoverable amount of assets 
in performing an impairment test requires 
significant judgement to ensure the estimates 
used are reasonable and appropriate, often 
under conditions of significant uncertainty. 
Impairment tests are often sensitive to minor 
changes in assumptions, for instance 
production profiles, forward oil and gas 
prices and capital expenditure plans, which 
have a consequent impact on whether an 
impairment charge is recognised or not in 
the consolidated financial statements. The 
same significance is attached to judgements 
and estimates can be applied to the fair  
value re-measurement of IES assets. 
IES impairment test results were presented  
to the Committee and Board at the year and 
half-year end. These tests were based on 
rigorous assessments performed by the IES 
finance team, checked by the external auditor 
and subsequently reviewed by the 
Committee. Asset impairment testing was 
considered as part of the year-end review 
process, together with forward oil and gas 
prices, forecast production levels, operating 
expenditure and capital expenditure for each 
IES asset. In addition, as part of the Santuario 
and Greater Stella Area (GSA) business 
combinations, the judgements and estimates 
used in the fair value re-measurement of IES 
assets were evaluated by the Committee. The 
Committee also reviewed the judgement to 
reclassify the JSD6000 as an asset held for 
sale as well as the estimates used in the 
impairment test that resulted in an impairment 
charge of US$176 million.
The Committee was 
satisfied that reasonable 
and appropriate judgement 
and estimates were 
applied by management  
to the asset impairment 
tests and fair value 
re-measurement of IES 
assets and the process 
and outcome were 
compliant with the  
relevant IFRS requirements 
while ensuring that the 
appropriate impairment 
and fair value adjustments 
were recognised in  
the Annual Report  
and Accounts.
Taxation The wide geographical spread of the 
Group’s operations and the increasingly 
complex nature of local tax rules in  
different jurisdictions increases the risk of 
misstatement of tax charges. Management 
is required to make a number of difficult 
judgements around uncertain tax exposures 
given the commercial structure of individual 
contracts, the increasing activity of the 
relevant tax authorities, and the 
recoverability and valuation of deferred  
tax assets, which are supported by  
future taxable profit forecasts.
The tax positions within the Group were 
reviewed by the Committee to ensure that  
the Group’s effective tax rate, tax provisions 
and the recognition of deferred tax asset 
assumptions continue to be appropriate.
Taxation issues were discussed with senior 
management, and reports outlining key tax 
issues, including the changes introduced 
through the enhanced global transparency 
reporting requirements and the new VAT 
regulations in the GCC states were reviewed. 
The external auditor also reported to the 
Committee on the findings of their audit  
of the Group’s tax charges and provisions.
The Committee was 
satisfied that Group tax 
issues were being 
effectively monitored and 
dealt with appropriately.
The changes within the 
global tax landscape 
mean that the Company is 
continuing to work on its 
ability to respond quickly 
to the enhanced reporting 
requirements, and that its 
tax positions appropriately 
reflect the impact of 
increased activity from tax 
authorities and regulators.

AUDIT COMMITTEE REPORT
CONTINUED External auditor
EY, the Company’s external auditor since October 2005, provided 
the Committee with reports and advice throughout the year.  
In accordance with the UK Competition and Markets Authority’s 
Statutory Audit Services Order, with which the Company complied 
with voluntarily, a full audit tender was completed during 2016,  
with the Company inviting four firms to participate. Following 
completion of the tender, the Committee recommended the 
re-appointment of EY as the Company’s Statutory Auditor and  
this became effective for the 2017 audit. The Committee remains 
satisfied as to the auditor’s effectiveness and, in making this 
assessment, had due regard of their expertise and understanding 
of the Group, their resourcing capabilities, culture, independence 
and objectivity. The Committee also took into account 
observations made by executive management in addition  
to their own interaction with EY throughout the year.
The Committee met with the auditor without management present 
to discuss any significant issues, not least the conduct of the audit, 
in advance of the full and half-year results. In addition, the 
Committee Chairman maintained regular contact with the lead 
audit partner outside the formal Committee meeting schedule,  
not only to discuss formal agenda items for upcoming meetings, 
but also to review other significant matters.
Each year, EY set out their proposed audit strategy and scope to 
ensure that the audit is aligned with the Committee’s expectations. 
This is carried out with due regard to the identification and 
assessment of business and financial statement risks that could 
impact the audit and continuing developments within the Group. 
During 2017 , the audit scope included the delivery of key projects 
and the financial close-out process of major contracts nearing 
completion; the ongoing contract renegotiations in IES, particularly 
in Mexico and Malaysia; and the continuing consideration of 
options related to the JSD6000 project. In addition, EY undertook 
work in relation to the SFO investigation primarily to determine 
whether the Company’s public disclosures were, and continue to 
be, consistent with the requirements of the ongoing investigation 
and that the entity level control environment remains effective.
At year end, a report of the work carried out by the auditor  
was provided to the Committee detailing areas of audit risk,  
the findings of which were reviewed and considered by 
the Committee.
Non-audit services
To safeguard the objectivity of our external auditor and to ensure 
the independence of the audit is not compromised, the Company 
has a non-audit services policy that provides clear definitions of 
services that our external auditor may and may not undertake. 
This policy was amended at the end of 2016 and became 
applicable with effect from 1 January 2017 . A copy of this policy 
can be found on at www.petrofac.com.
To ensure compliance with this policy, the Committee reviews the 
Group’s cumulative non-audit spend and, furthermore, gives prior 
approval to the appointment of EY, should the nature or size of the 
proposed work require it. Taking into account reports from both 
management and EY, the Committee is satisfied that EY’s 
objectivity and independence was not impaired by any non-audit 
work undertaken by them during the year and confirms there  
were no breaches to the policy during 2017 . In addition, EY has 
confirmed that it was compliant with APB Ethical Standards in 
relation to the audit engagement.
Historically, EY have provided advice and in-country tax 
compliance services as it was felt that, given EY’s knowledge of 
the Group and their presence in our core regions, they were the 
most appropriate provider of this work. However, under the current 
policy, such work is only permitted with the prior approval of the 
Committee, and only in relation to Group entities incorporated 
outside the European Union. Details of the fees in respect of audit 
and non-audit related services can be found on page 135 and in 
note 4e to the financial statements.
The non-audit spend for the year, as a percentage of the overall 
audit fee, was 32.4% (2016: 31.6%), with the majority of costs 
relating to two specific operational projects and an impact 
assessment in respect of the introduction of VAT charges in UAE. 
Towards the end of 2017 , EY were appointed, following completion 
of a competitive tender process, to assist the Company with a 
strategic project. The Committee reviewed and approved the 
scope of this project and the work to be undertaken by EY and 
were satisfied that the independence and objectives of the 
external auditor was not impaired.
Non-audit services policy
• The external auditor is automatically prohibited from carrying out 
work which might impair their objectivity (as defined by reference 
to the FRC’s Revised Ethical Standard 2016 Part B Section 5).
• The Chief Financial Officer (CFO) will seek approval from the 
Committee before appointing the external auditor to carry out  
a piece of non-audit work where:
 – the fee is US$50,000 or above; or
 – total non-audit fees for the year are approaching 50% of the 
average of the Group fees paid in the last three consecutive 
financial years.
• The external auditor will only be appointed to do types of audit 
work permitted within and outside the EU as set out in the policy. 
The Company will not seek, other than in exceptional cases, to 
rely on the more flexible regime permitted outside the EU.
• The CFO may appoint the external auditor to carry out other 
types of permitted non-audit work as listed in the policy, subject 
to the policy provisions and provided the fee is below $50,000.

COMMITTEE SUMMARY
Dear shareholder
In August 2017 , the Board approved the formation of the 
Compliance and Ethics Committee. This Committee, which consists 
of three Non-executive Directors, met four times during 2017 . It was 
established to uphold and oversee the continued implementation of 
the principles and rules relating to compliance and ethics across the 
Group, as set out in the Company’s Code of Conduct and its 
Standard for the Prevention of Bribery and Corruption.
One of the Committee’s key roles is to support the Board in 
fulfilling its oversight responsibilities in all respects of compliance 
and ethics, and to support the provision of assurance to Petrofac’s 
stakeholders, ensuring that the Company’s policies and approach 
to compliance and ethics remain adequate and effective.  
The Committee, working together with the Board and senior 
management, aims to promote the importance of, and the 
Company’s commitment to, its compliance and ethical 
programme with both employees and stakeholders, and to  
drive the compliance agenda at Board level.
Ongoing work
Recognising the need to promote and enhance the Group’s 
compliance and ethics programme further, the establishment of 
this Committee has enabled greater focus to be given to the work 
that has been undertaken during the course of the year.
An independent consultancy was engaged early in 2017 to provide 
forensic risk consulting services to the Company in relation to the 
existing compliance structure, governance, and related process 
and procedures. This followed completion of the internal audit 
work carried out to assess the adequacy of the current controls 
environment in relation to the management of the risk of bribery, 
corruption and/or fraud when contracting with third parties, as 
reported in the Audit Committee report on page 85. The scope of 
work agreed included: understanding the Company’s compliance 
programme and the processes and procedures already in place; 
recommending possible enhancements to the Group’s anti-
bribery and corruption compliance framework and governance; 
and to suggest appropriate recommendations in relation to 
financial controls compliance.
During the year, Group Compliance and the independent 
consultancy worked closely together to identify where proposed 
ABC enhancements could be implemented and, in light of the 
expansion of the Group Compliance function’s remit, assessed the 
increased resourcing demands and suggested possible alternative 
Group Compliance structures for Committee consideration.
88 / Petrofac Annual report and accounts 2017
COMPLIANCE AND ETHICS COMMITTEE REPORT Since formation, the Committee has been actively involved in 
assessing the work being undertaken in relation to compliance. 
Updates have been provided to explain the enhanced compliance 
processes and procedures that are being embedded across the 
Group. These updates have enabled the Committee to monitor 
the continuing development and ongoing implementation of the 
compliance programme. A key focus of this review has been to 
reinforce business ownership for compliance risks, as it is believed 
this facilitates the embedding of the enhanced compliance 
framework across all assets and projects within the Group.
The Company’s compliance portal is at the centre of the 
compliance programme and is an essential tool for the ongoing 
scrutiny of third-parties through risk-based due diligence. Work 
has been ongoing throughout 2017 to enhance the functional 
reliability of this portal and to facilitate automated integration  
with the Company’s ERP system. As a result, changes are being 
introduced to enable compliance due diligence to be more 
automated, thereby enabling greater independent oversight on 
relevant controls to be exercised by Group Compliance. It is 
envisaged that this work will enable an agreed set of compliance 
metrics for Group and project related compliance to be produced 
on a more regular basis, thereby capturing individual elements of 
the compliance programme. This will further enhance the 
Committee’s ability to monitor and measure compliance 
implementation at both Group and project levels, and for a 
scorecard of measurable KPIs to be created and reviewed  
at each Committee meeting.
Speak Up programme
On its formation, the Committee assumed responsibility for the 
Company’s Speak Up programme and related policy from the 
Audit Committee. It should, however, be stated that as set out in 
its terms of reference, the Committee aims to work in conjunction 
with the Audit Committee, as required, on the adequacy and 
security of the programme and will raise any alleged breach of a 
financial nature to ensure there are no violations to the Company’s 
internal financial controls. 
Going forward, any alleged breaches of the Code of Conduct that 
are received, either directly or through the Company’s Speak Up 
hotline, will be governed by an investigations protocol, which has 
been jointly developed by Group Compliance, Group Legal,  
Group HR and Group Internal Audit. As part of the new Group 
Compliance structure, there is now a dedicated resource available 
to investigate all Speak Up claims, and it is envisaged that this will 
ensure reported breaches are reviewed and assessed quickly to 
determine what further investigation is warranted and to ensure 
that appropriate action is taken.
The Committee receives details of any alleged breaches of the 
Company’s Code of Conduct, the issues reported, together  
with any proposed action. During 2017 , 102 calls were received  
in relation to various issues. Discussions were held with the 
Committee to outline the relevant investigations and the actions 
being taken, including preventative activities required to avoid 
recurrence. Further details of our Code of Conduct, including  
the Speak Up facility, are provided on page 65.
Third Party Risk Committee
During the year, the Company reviewed the forum by which it 
considered certain higher-risk third parties, with the aim of 
exercising additional oversight. As a consequence, the Third Party 
Risk Committee (TPRC) was established, succeeding the existing 
Agents and Consultants Committee. The TRPC’s remit is to 
ensure the Group engages, renews or varies the terms of 
agreements and ongoing payments with certain third-parties, only 
after appropriate rigorous due diligence and consideration of the 
business rationale. Applications from within the business to enter 
into, vary or renew any contract or arrangements with any 
third-party, as defined by conditions set out in the TRPC’s terms  
of reference, and the circumstances of the proposed appointment 
or variation, will be considered carefully by the TPRC. Where any 
matters of concern are raised, the TPRC may instruct the Group 
Head of Compliance (or any other function, as appropriate), to  
take such action as it considers necessary. The TPRC will report 
to this Committee and, at least once a year, will provide a list and 
brief description of all third parties that have fallen within the 
TPRC’s remit.
Conclusion
When I assumed the post of Chairman of this Committee, I was 
fully aware of the significant effort and resource that the Group had 
already committed to being an ethical and compliant company 
and enhancing its compliance framework. The Board has a firm 
belief that the only way the Company can continue to have a 
licence to operate is by applying sound and ethical business 
practices wherever we work. We are equally aware that there will 
always be more to do and we must always seek to improve and 
continue to expect the highest standards of behaviour from our 
employees and of those working with and for us. The Board will 
not tolerate improper business conduct and all necessary action 
will be taken to ensure effective compliance with our policies  
and procedures.

Governance Dear shareholder
On behalf of the Board, and as your new Committee Chairman,  
I am pleased to present the Directors’ Remuneration Report for 
the year ended 31 December 2017 . Firstly, I would like to express 
sincere thanks to my predecessor, Thomas Thune Andersen, for 
his work with the Committee over the last seven years. He led the 
Committee through a number of regulatory changes during his 
tenure and I now look forward to taking this position forward over 
the coming years. Following Thomas’ departure at the end of 
2017 , the Committee is pleased to welcome Sara Akbar, who 
joined the Board in January 2018, to the Committee as a member. 
Sara, who until recently was the Chief Executive Officer of Kuwait 
Energy KSC, has a wealth of industry experience and we look 
forward to working with her. 
2017 Report 
This report is split into two parts:
Our Annual Report on Remuneration
This summarises the remuneration outcomes for 2017 and 
explains how we intend to apply the Remuneration Policy for 
2018. As a Jersey-incorporated company, Petrofac is not subject 
to the UK remuneration reporting regulations which apply to  
UK incorporated companies. Nevertheless, the Committee 
recognises the importance of effective corporate governance 
and is firmly committed to best practice. We therefore propose  
to continue to operate in line with the UK reporting regulations 
and, accordingly, will be submitting our Annual Report on 
Remuneration for an advisory shareholder vote at the 2018 
Annual General Meeting (AGM).
Summary of our Remuneration Policy
The Company’s Remuneration Policy was approved at the 2017 
AGM. No changes have been made to the policy this year and 
accordingly, we are not seeking approval for a new policy. This 
section is for information only and a copy of our full policy is 
available on our website at www.petrofac.com/remuneration.
2017 Business context
In the face of the various challenges which Petrofac experienced 
during 2017 , the Company delivered a strong performance overall. 
In a competitive market, clients demonstrated their confidence in 
Petrofac, resulting in increased order intake. The Company also 
made progress on organic growth opportunities, reduced its 
capital intensity, while the business was able to continue to provide 
a best-in-class project delivery to our customers against an 
impressive safety performance. The Committee considers that 
Petrofac’s 2017 performance positions it well for sustained 
long-term success.
Turning to Group performance in more detail, the portfolio of 
project work remains in good shape. By emphasising project 
delivery as its core competence and by maintaining cost 
competitiveness through operational excellence, Petrofac was able 
to deliver a set of solid financial results while taking continued steps 
to reduce capital intensity and strengthening our balance sheet. 
Matthias Bichsel

COMMITTEE SUMMARY
90 / Petrofac Annual report and accounts 2017
DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION REPORT Compared with the prior year, order intake in 2017 increased,  
with US$5.2 billion in new awards in both existing and new 
markets. The business secured its first work in Turkey, a new 
US$340 million gas receiving terminal, demonstrating the results  
of the focus on organic growth and growing capabilities in 
complementary markets. There was also the successful 
completion of the Santuario contract migration in Mexico,  
the first one in Mexico’s history. In addition, EPC returned to  
work in Russia, competitively winning a US$700 million contract 
on Sakhalin Island.
The focus on adjacent sectors saw Petrofac extend its 
downstream credentials, including two new awards in Oman, 
comprising a 50/50 joint venture with Samsung Engineering for  
the US$2 billion Duqm Refinery project, and Phase 2 of the BP 
Khazzan project. An award for a floating wind turbine research 
project with the UK’s Carbon Trust further demonstrated further 
progress in new sectors.
As a whole, this backlog ensures that the business enters 2018 
with excellent revenue-generation visibility and a strong bidding 
pipeline that provides confidence that momentum can be 
maintained through the year ahead.
The Company demonstrated exceptional safety performance 
during 2017 . Petrofac’s safety record outperformed industry 
averages and the business was rewarded with several safety 
accolades. An example is the site safety record on the BP 
Khazzan project in Oman which reached 6.5 million hours without 
a safety incident. Across the business as a whole there were no 
recordable fatalities, and fewer Lost-Time and High Potential 
Incidents than in the prior year. 
Remuneration outcomes for 2017
The annual bonus for Executive Directors is based on the 
achievement of Group financial targets (60%), and a balanced 
scorecard (40%) containing health and safety, strategic, 
operational and individual objectives.
The business delivered very strongly against our cash flow targets, 
emphasising the excellent progress made during the year on cash 
conversion. There was also good delivery against the net profit 
goals. Performance on new orders, while representing an 
improvement over 2016 in a very competitive market, nevertheless 
fell short of the stretching targets that the Committee set at the 
start of the year. 
When coupled with consideration of the Executive Directors’ 
performance against the targets of their personal balanced 
scorecards, annual bonus out-turns for the CEO and CFO  
were 60.4% and 70.4% of maximum, respectively.
The performance period for the 2015 Performance Share Plan 
(PSP) cycle ended on 31 December 2017 . Based on performance 
against the three-year relative Total Shareholder Return (TSR)  
and Earnings per share (EPS) targets, the 2015 PSP awards 
lapsed in full.
Group Chief Operating Officer
On 25 May 2017 , the Group Chief Operating Officer, Marwan 
Chedid, was suspended until further notice and, as a 
consequence, he resigned from the Board. Mr Chedid has 
received a pro-rated annual bonus in respect of 2017 , based  
on the same financial results as the other Executive Directors  
and an assessment of his personal performance during the first 
five months of the year. Recognising that the outcome of the SFO 
investigation may not be known for some time, Mr Chedid has 
agreed that this bonus payment be subject to a clawback 
provision, such that the Committee may demand repayment of  
all or part of the bonus in the event that Mr Chedid is found guilty 
of any charges brought as a result of the SFO investigation. 
Remuneration for 2018
In 2018 we will continue to operate our remuneration 
arrangements in line with the Policy which was approved by 
shareholders at the 2017 AGM. A summary of this Policy is  
set out on pages 102 to 105.
In line with the wider employee population, Executive Directors 
will receive a salary increase of 3% in 2018. This represents Mr 
Asfari’s first salary increase in four years, and Mr Cochran’s first 
increase since appointment in October 2016. No other changes 
are being made to the Executive Directors’ remuneration 
arrangements in 2018.
With effect from January 2018, the Non-executive Director fee will 
increase to £75,000 and the fee for the Chairman will increase to 
£320,000, representing the first increases since July 2014. It has 
been agreed that there will be no further increase in these fees for 
the next three years. In addition, the Non-executive Directors and 
Chairman will also use a portion of their fees to purchase Petrofac 
shares on the open market. Each Non-executive Director shall 
purchase at least £5,000 of shares and the Chairman at least 
£20,000 of shares each quarter, which will further align directors’ 
interests with those of shareholders and demonstrate their 
confidence in the future of the Company. 
The Committee hopes to receive your support for this report  
at the forthcoming AGM.

Governance Our remuneration principles
The Committee aims to establish a level of remuneration which:
• is sufficient to promote the long-term success of the Company 
whilst paying no more than necessary; and
• reflects the size, complexity and international scope of the 
Group’s business, together with an executive’s individual 
contribution and geographical location.
Under our Remuneration Policy:
• base salaries are generally median or below, against a relevant 
benchmarking group;
• variable elements of remuneration are structured so that 
individuals can achieve upper quartile total remuneration, 
subject to achievement of challenging performance standards 
which should be transparent, stretching and rigorously applied.
The Committee considers the policy ensures that Executive 
Directors and senior managers are incentivised to deliver the 
Group’s strategic goals and long-term shareholder value. 
The Annual Report on Remuneration, beginning on page 93, 
provides more detail on our policy implementation.

Notes to the table
1   UK-based and European-based Directors are paid in either sterling or euro. Amounts have been translated to US dollars based on the prevailing rate at the  
date of payment or award with the exception of the bonus amounts, which have been translated using the average exchange rate for 2017 of £1:US$1.292433.
2   Alastair Cochran was appointed as a Director on 20 October 2016. The 2016 figures reflect the period from 20 October to 31 December 2016.
3   Andrea Abt and George Pierson were appointed as Directors on 19 May 2016. The 2016 figures reflect the period from this date to 31 December 2016.
4   Thomas Thune Andersen ceased to be a Director from 31 December 2017. Thomas ceased to be the Senior Independent Director during 2017 and accordingly,  
the fee for this role was split between Thomas and René Médori with effect from 1 September 2017. 
5   Marwan Chedid ceased to be a Director from 25 May 2017. The 2017 figures reflect the period from 1 January 2017 to this date. 
6   Jane Sadowsky was appointed as a Director on 1 November 2016. The 2016 figure reflects the period from this date to 31 December 2016. Jane ceased to be a Director  
on 18 May 2017. The 2017 figure reflects the period from 1 January 2017 to this date.
7   Non-executive Directors received a basic fee of £67,000 per annum and additional fees of £15,000 per annum for acting as either the Chairman of a Board Committee  
or as the Senior Independent Director. Rijnhard van Tets, as Chairman, received a fee of £290,000 per annum. These fees were last reviewed in August 2017  
(with no increase being made). Amounts have been translated to US dollars based on the prevailing rate at the date of payment.
Further notes to the table – methodology
(a)  Salary and fees – the cash paid in respect of 2017.
( b)   Benefits – the taxable value of all benefits paid in respect of 2017. UK-resident Executive Directors receive private health insurance and appropriate life assurance. In 2016 Ayman 
Asfari’s benefits primarily related to the employment of a personal assistant who was partly engaged in support of the administration of his personal affairs until 31 March 2016. Marwan 
Chedid received similar benefits to UK-resident Executive Directors and in addition received other typical expatriate benefits, such as return flights to his permanent home. The 2017 
figure for Mr Chedid reflects the period from 1 January to 25 May 2017.
( c)   Cash in lieu of pension and other benefits – UK-resident Executive Directors receive a cash allowance in place of benefits including car allowances and pension contributions  
but without an explicit allocation to each. This reflects the application of the Company’s Remuneration Policy (as set out on pages 102 to 105). Directors do not receive pension 
contributions from the Company. Marwan Chedid received a cash allowance in respect of housing, utilities and transport, in line with local market practice.
(d)  Post-employment benefit – all non-UAE national employees, including Directors working in the UAE, are required by local statute to receive an end of service indemnity payment. 
These sums, based on years of service and salary, will be paid by the Company only on termination of the individual’s employment from the UAE. The total amount retained as at  
25 May 2017 in respect of Marwan Chedid was US$1,335,238.
(e)   Annual bonus – cash bonus paid in respect of 2017.
( f )   Long-term incentives – as a result of the performance over the period 2015-2017, the 2015 Performance Share Plan awarded to Ayman Asfari and Marwan Chedid  
will lapse in full on 6 March 2018. The 2016 figure shown for Alastair Cochran relates to the buy-out awards made to him on appointment to the Company in September 2017.

Annual bonus
Our annual bonus framework is intended to ensure an increased transparency of outcomes, in line with best practice developments. 
Financial elements comprise 60% of the framework, while performance against a balanced scorecard of measures comprises the 
remaining 40%. The table below sets out the outcomes for the Executive Directors against our financial targets:
Performance targets
Pay-out  
as % of 
maximum Measure Weighting Threshold Target Maximum

As a % of maximum 50.7%
As a % of salary earned (out of 120% for financial elements) 60.8%
1 The actual 2017 Group order intake of US$4,695 million, used in the annual bonus framework, includes the negative impact of certain variation order reversals. These variation order 
reversals were not excluded from the order intake metric of US$5.2 billion reported elsewhere in this Annual Report but were instead deducted from the closing 2017 backlog position. 
As the table above highlights, our financial performance resulted in a pay-out against the financial measures of 51% of maximum (61% of 
salary). This out-turn reflects the strong progress the business made on cash conversion, good delivery on our net income goals, and new 
orders that fell short of the targets set at the start of the year, despite a good recovery in absolute terms in a competitive marketplace.
The Group net income outturn of US$382 million (pre-exceptional items and certain remeasurements) includes an adjustment to reverse 
the impact of a US$38 million derecognition of deferred tax. The Committee considered it fair and appropriate to adjust for this impact, 
which largely reflect reforms to corporation tax loss relief that were enacted in October 2017 . These changes were not known at the time 
the targets were set and were not considered to be reflective of underlying business performance by the Committee. This explains the 
difference between the figure shown above and those presented in the Financial review on pages 42 to 45. 
The remainder of the annual bonus (40%) is subject to a balanced scorecard of measures, aligned with our business plan and key 
corporate objectives. The scorecard ensures that the Committee considers not only the financial performance measures achieved  
but also the wider health of the Company, safeguarding future years’ performance, and the manner and behaviours by which our 
performance has been delivered. In particular, the scorecard captures performance under five areas: health & safety and compliance; 
operational and project delivery; financial performance; capability; and strategic growth measures. Under each of these areas, Executive 
Directors have a number of tailored performance objectives based on their particular areas of focus, performance against which is 
assessed at year-end based on a 1-5 scored system. The overall score for each Executive Director is used in determining their individual 
score under the balanced scorecard element. Examples of performance against the individual measures on which the Executive 
Directors were assessed in determining their performance against the scorecard include:
Ayman Asfari – Delivered Group financial performance; drove compliance and HSSEIA culture and values throughout Petrofac 
and placed strong emphasis on the Code of Business Conduct, mandatory training completion rates improved, 
site visits and lost-time metrics; delivered succession planning objectives and organisational design; and 
successfully communicated Group strategy and the investment proposition to all stakeholders.
Alastair Cochran – Provided resilient financial operations and controls; drove the successful enhancement of processes across 
enterprise risk management and assurance; successfully implemented plans to reduce Petrofac’s capital 
intensity and streamline the business; and refreshed and delivered finance succession plans.
Marwan Chedid – Delivered Group financial performance; drove HSSEIA performance in our operations; and supported  
collection of commercial settlements.
Based on aggregate performance against the financial metrics and their balanced scorecard, the table below provides an overview  
of the annual bonuses received by each Executive Director in office during 2017:

be subject to a clawback provision in the event that either is found guilty of any charges brought as a result of the SFO investigation.

Performance Share Plan awards
As outlined in the Policy table on page 105, PSP awards are granted over Petrofac shares representing an opportunity to receive 
ordinary shares if performance conditions are met over the relevant three-year period. The number of shares under award is determined 
by reference to a percentage of base salary. Details of the actual number of shares granted are set out on page 97 . The following table 
provides details of the awards made under the PSP on 13 September 2017 . These awards were made later in the year than usual as a 
result of operational restrictions, which included adherence to the Company’s Share Dealing Code. Performance for these awards is 
measured over the three financial years from 1 January 2017 to 31 December 2019.

TSR element
70% of the 2017 award is based on relative TSR, reflecting the importance we place on creating sustainable long-term shareholder 
value. The TSR peer group was updated for this cycle to more accurately reflect the changing nature of the companies against which 
Petrofac competes and, in addition, we simplified the TSR measure by moving to a “ranked” instead of an “indexed” approach, to create 
a simpler and more transparent TSR metric. The Comparator group and TSR targets for 2017 were as set out in the tables below.

Governance Strategic element
The remaining 30% of the 2017 award is based on a basket of key strategic measures. We believe these measures align our incentives 
with the delivery of critical long-term strategic goals. For the 2017 awards, the measures focused on (i) protecting our core E&C 
business; (ii) growing our reimbursable services offering; (iii) reducing capital intensity by improving working capital and cash 
management; and (iv) delivering “back to our core” strategy. Each measure is subject to stretching underlying targets. The key  
strategic priorities and associated measures for 2017 are as follows: 
Strategic priorities Performance measure
Protecting our core E&C business E&C net income
Protecting and growing our reimbursable services offering EPS net income
Reducing capital intensity Divestment proceeds

1 Ayman Asfari is expected to build up a shareholding of three times salary. He substantially exceeds this shareholding requirement.
2 Alastair Cochran and Marwan Chedid are expected to build up a shareholding of two times salary. Mr Cochran was appointed as a Director on 20 October 2016. As a result of 
operational restrictions, he has been unable to fulfil his shareholder guideline obligation. The Board is fully aware of this situation and understands that he will purchase shares  
as soon as he is able to do so. Marwan Chedid’s shareholding requirement has been met in full. For the purposes of determining Executive Director shareholdings, the individual’s  
salary and the share price as at 31 December 2017 of 510 pence per share have been used.

Governance Payments for loss of office
Jane Sadowsky ceased to be a Director from 18 May 2017 , Marwan Chedid ceased to be a Director from 25 May 2017 , and Thomas 
Thune Andersen ceased to be a Director from 31 December 2017 . No payment for loss of office was made to any Director during 2017 . 
The Company does not have any agreements with any Director or employee that would provide compensation for loss of office or 
employment resulting from a takeover. There are, however, provisions included within the Company’s share plans that may cause 
awards to vest. In addition, the Restricted Share Plan award granted to Mr Cochran in October 2016 prior to his appointment as a 
Director, is subject to an additional provision that would enable full vesting of the award in the event of a change of control. Full details  
of these provisions are included in the Directors’ Remuneration Policy, which was approved by shareholders at the AGM in May 2017 .  
A copy of the policy is available at www.petrofac.com.

CONTINUED Relative importance of the spend on pay
The chart below illustrates the change in total remuneration, 
dividends paid and net profit from 2016 to 2017 .
The figures presented have been calculated on the  
following bases:
• Dividends – dividends paid in respect of the financial year.
• Net profit – our reported net profit in respect of the financial 
year. This is a key performance indicator for the Company.  
The Committee therefore believes it is the most direct reflection 
of our underlying financial performance.
• Total remuneration – represents total salaries paid to all 
Group employees in respect of the financial year (see page  
135 of the report for an explanation as to how this value is 
calculated). Note that this includes social security costs, benefit 
and pension costs and share-based payment expenses.

Implementation of Remuneration Policy in 2018
This section provides an overview of how the Committee is 
proposing to implement our Remuneration Policy in 2018.
Base salary
Executive Directors will receive a salary increase of 3% in 2018,  
in line with the wider employee population. This represents  
Mr Asfari’s first salary increase in four years and Mr Cochran’s  
first increase since appointment in October 2016. 
The table below shows the base salaries for 2018:
2018 basic salary 2017 basic salary
Ayman Asfari £670,000 £650,000
Alastair Cochran £412,000 £400,000
Benefits 
There are no changes proposed to the benefit framework in 2018.
Cash allowance in lieu of pension and car allowance
The table below shows cash allowances for 2018, which are

Non-executive Director remuneration
Non-executive Director remuneration will increase in 2018, the  
first since a modest increase was made in July 2014, to recognise 
the increased workload and time commitment expected from 
Non-executive Directors. It has been agreed that there will be no 
further increase in these fees for the next three years.
The table below shows the Non-executive Director fee structure 
effective from 1 January 2018:
2018 fees
Chairman of the Board fee £320,000
Basic Non-executive Director fee £75,000
Board Committee Chairman fee £15,000
Senior Independent Director fee £15,000
There are no fees paid for membership of Board Committees.
With effect from January 2018, it has also been agreed that the 
Chairman and the Non-executive Directors will use a portion of 
their fees, which are paid quarterly, to purchase Petrofac shares 
on the open market. Each Non-executive Director shall purchase 
at least £5,000 worth of shares and the Chairman at least £20,000 
of shares, per quarter. This will further align Directors’ interests with 
those of shareholders and demonstrates the Director’s confidence 
in the future of the Company.

Governance Annual bonus
The maximum annual bonus opportunity for Executive Directors 
will remain at 200% of base salary for 2018.
The table below sets out the financial elements, which comprise 
60% of the total annual bonus:
Measure
Weighting in total 
bonus
Financial measures Group Net Income

20%
Group Order Intake 20%
Group Free Cash Flow 20%
1 Measured as Group business performance before exceptional items and certain 
re-measurements.
In line with 2017 , the remaining 40% of the annual bonus will 
comprise a balanced scorecard, providing the Committee with  
the ability to consider not only financial achievements, but also  
the wider health of the Company and the manner and behaviours 
by which our performance has been delivered. The scorecard 
includes measures related to health and safety, operational, 
strategic and individual objectives. We will provide disclosure of 
2018 targets at the end of the performance year.
Where any participant has not reached the shareholding guideline 
target, they will be required to invest one-third of their post-tax 
bonus into Petrofac shares until the guideline is reached. The 
annual bonus is subject to clawback provisions.
Performance Share Plan
For 2018, it is proposed that all Executive Directors will receive  
an award of 200% of base salary.
There are no changes to the performance measures used in  
the 2018 PSP awards, although the Committee has taken the 
opportunity to review and update the TSR comparator group to 
more accurately reflect the companies against which Petrofac 
competes given the changing shape of the business.
1) TSR element
The tables below set out the TSR comparator group for the 
purposes of the 2018 awards and the vesting schedule used to 
determine the performance outcome:
Comparator group
Chicago Bridge  
& Iron Co. JGC Corporation Technip FMC
Daelim Industrial Co KBR, Inc. Tecnicas Reunidas
Fluor Corporation Maire Tecnimont Worley Parsons
GS Engineering & 
Construction Corp Saipem Wood Group (John)
Hyundai E&C
Samsung  
Engineering Co., Ltd.
Vesting schedule
Three-year performance against the comparator group
Vesting as % of 
maximum
Performance equal to median 25%
Performance equal to upper quartile 100%
Straight-line vesting between the points above
2) Strategic element
The remaining 30% of the 2018 PSP award will be subject to 
three-year strategic performance conditions. For the 2018 awards, 
the Committee has set stretching targets to four key strategic 
priorities. The key strategic priorities and associated measures  
for 2018 are as follows:
Strategic priorities Performance measure
Protecting our core E&C business E&C net income
Protecting and growing our reimbursable 
services offering EPS net income
Reducing capital intensity Divestment proceeds
Delivering ‘back to our core’ strategy Cash conversion
Under each strategic priority, vesting for threshold performance 
will be 25% of maximum with straight-line vesting up to 100% of 
maximum. At this stage, the Committee considers that the precise 
targets for 2018 are commercially sensitive. However, we intend to 
provide detailed disclosure of targets and performance against 
those targets following the end of the performance period. 
Any vested post-tax shares will be subject to an additional 
two-year holding period. In addition, where participants have not 
reached the shareholding guideline target they will be required  
to continue to hold any shares after the holding period until the 
guideline is reached. PSP awards are subject to malus and 
clawback provisions.

DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION REPORT
CONTINUED Consideration by the Directors of matters  
relating to Directors’ remuneration
Support for the Committee
During the year, the Committee received independent advice  
on executive remuneration matters from Deloitte LLP (Deloitte). 
Deloitte were formally appointed as advisors by the Committee  
in October 2005, following a recommendation from the  
Non-executive Chairman at the time. Deloitte is a member of  
the Remuneration Consultants Group and, as such, voluntarily 
operates under a code of conduct in relation to executive 
remuneration consulting in the UK.
The Committee has reviewed the advice provided by Deloitte 
during the year and is satisfied that it has been objective and 
independent. Total fees received by Deloitte in relation to the 
remuneration advice provided to the Committee during 2017 
amounted to £79,800 based on the required time commitment. 
During 2017 , Deloitte also provided tax services to the Company.
The individuals listed in the table below, none of whom were 
Committee members, materially assisted the Committee in 
considering executive remuneration and attended at least part  
of one meeting, by invitation, during the year:

None of the individuals attended part of any meeting in which  
their own compensation was discussed.
Governance
The Board and the Committee consider that, throughout 2017  
and up to the date of this report, the Company has complied with 
the provisions of the UK Governance Code relating to Directors’ 
remuneration. In addition, relevant guidelines issued by prominent 
investor bodies and proxy voting agencies have been presented  
to and considered by the Committee during its discussions.
The Committee endeavours to consider executive remuneration 
matters in the context of alignment with risk management and, 
during the year, had oversight of any related factors to be taken 
into consideration. The Committee believes that the remuneration 
arrangements in place do not raise any health and safety, 
environmental, social or ethical issues, nor inadvertently motivate 
irresponsible behaviour.
External board appointments
Executive Directors are normally entitled to accept one non-
executive appointment outside the Company with the consent  
of the Board. Any fees received may be retained by the Director. 
As at the date of this report, no Executive Director holds an 
externally paid non-executive appointment.
Shareholder voting
The table below outlines the result of the advisory vote of the 2016 
Directors’ Remuneration Report and Policy Report received at the 
2017 AGM.

Committee would like to take this opportunity to thank 
shareholders for their support. 
Availability of documentation
Service contracts and letters of appointment for all Directors are 
available for inspection by any person at our registered office in 
Jersey and at our corporate services office in London. They will 
also be available for inspection during the 30 minutes prior to  
the start of our AGM to be held in London on 18 May 2018.
Annual General Meeting
As set out in my statement on page 90, with consideration to  
the new remuneration reporting regulations, our Annual Report  
on Remuneration will be subject to an advisory shareholder vote  
at the AGM to be held on 18 May 2018.

Governance Policy report
Looking forward
Our Directors’ Remuneration Policy (the ‘Policy’) was approved by shareholders at the AGM held on 1 1 May 2017 for a period of  
up to three years. In order to provide the context in which individual remuneration decisions have been made during the year, the 
approved policy table, and notes to the table, have been included below. The full Remuneration Policy, as approved, is available at 
www.petrofac.com/remuneration. The policy for Executive Directors is designed in line with the remuneration philosophy and 
principles that underpin remuneration for the wider Group and all reward arrangements are built around common objectives  
and principles.
As a Jersey-incorporated company, Petrofac does not have the benefit of the statutory protections afforded by the UK Companies  
Act 2006. While the Policy Report was not submitted as a binding resolution at the 2017 AGM, the Committee considers the vote of 
shareholders to be binding in its application. However, if there is any inconsistency between the Company’s Policy Report (as approved 
by shareholders) and any contractual entitlement or other right of a Director, the Company may be obliged to honour that existing 
entitlement or right.
Fixed remuneration – Executive Directors
Element/Purpose  
and link to strategy Operation Maximum opportunity Performance measures
Salary
Core element  
of remuneration, 
paid for doing  
the expected 
day-to-day job
• The Committee takes into consideration a 
number of factors when setting salaries, 
including (but not limited to):
 – size and scope of the individual’s 
responsibilities;
 – the individual’s skills, experience and 
performance;
 – typical salary levels for comparable roles  
within appropriate pay comparators; and
 – pay and conditions elsewhere in the Group
• Basic salaries are normally reviewed at the 
beginning of each year, with any change usually 
being effective from 1 January.
• Whilst there is no maximum salary level, any 
increases will normally be broadly in line with the 
wider employee population within the relevant 
geographic area.
• Higher increases may be made under certain 
circumstances, at the Committee’s discretion. 
For example, this may include:
 – increase in the scope and/or responsibility  
of the individual’s role; and
 – development of the individual within the role.
• In addition, where an Executive Director has been 
appointed to the Board at a lower than typical salary, 
larger increases may be awarded to move them 
closer to market practice as their experience 
develops.
• None.
Cash allowance 
in lieu of pension 
and other 
benefits 
Provide employees 
with an allowance 
for benefits and 
retirement planning
• UK-resident Executive Directors receive a cash 
allowance in place of certain benefits including, 
but not limited to, car allowances and pension 
contributions.
• Non UK-resident Executive Directors receive a 
cash allowance in respect of housing, utilities 
and transport, in line with local market practice.
• Whilst there is no maximum cash allowance level,  
any increase will normally be broadly in line with  
the wider employee population within the relevant 
geographical area.
• For non UK-resident Executive Directors, whilst there 
is no maximum level of cash allowance prescribed, 
the levels provided are intended to be broadly market 
typical for role and geographic location. The levels of 
cash allowance provided are kept under regular 
review by the Committee.
• Normally, in determining any increase to cash 
allowances, the Committee will have regard to the 
rate of increase in the cost of living in the local market 
and other appropriate indicators.
• None.
Pension
No Executive 
Director currently 
participates in a 
formal pension 
arrangement
• Executive Directors receive a cash allowance  
in lieu of pension provision (see above).
• The Company operates defined contribution 
pension arrangements across the Group. In line 
with legal requirements, the Company offers 
participation in the UK pension plan to its 
UK-based Executive Directors. However, both 
current UK-based Executive Directors chose to 
opt out of these arrangements and, as such, 
continue to receive a cash allowance in lieu  
of pension provision.
• Although both current UK-based Executive Directors 
have opted to receive a cash allowance in lieu of 
pension provision, this position is kept under review.
• As the Committee would want to conduct a thorough 
review prior to Executive Directors joining a Group 
pension arrangement, it would not be appropriate to 
provide a maximum level of pension provision at this 
time. However, if this did occur, the level of provision 
would typically be dependent on seniority, the cost of 
the arrangements, market practice and pension 
practice elsewhere in the Group.
• None.

Benefits

with market 
competitive 
benefits
• UK-based Executive Directors receive benefits 
which may include (but are not limited to) private 
health insurance for the Executive Director and 
their family and appropriate other life insurance 
arrangements.
• Non UK-based Executive Directors receive 
similar benefits to UK-resident Executive 
Directors and in addition receive other typical 
expatriate benefits, which may include (but are 
not limited to) children’s education, return flights 
to their permanent home, tax equalisation, and 
appropriate insurance arrangements.
• Where Executive Directors are required to 
relocate, the Committee may offer additional 
expatriate benefits, if considered appropriate.
• Expenses incurred in the performance of duties 
for the Company may be reimbursed or paid for 
directly by the Company, as appropriate, 
including any tax due on the payments.
• UK-based Executive Directors are also eligible  
to participate in any tax-approved all employee 
share plans operated by the Company on the 
same basis as other eligible employees.  
Petrofac currently operates a Share Incentive 
Plan in the UK.
• Whilst no maximum level of benefits is prescribed, 
they are set at an appropriate market competitive 
level, taking into account a number of factors,  
which may include:
 – the jurisdiction in which the individual is based;
 – the level of benefits provided for other employees 
within the Group; and
 – market practice for comparable roles within 
appropriate pay comparators
• The Committee keeps the benefits policy and benefit 
levels under regular review.
• Where Executive Directors participate in all employee 
share plans their maximum opportunity is as 
prescribed in the plan at that time.
• None.
End of service 
indemnity
Paid to UAE 
based
Executive 
Directors only,  
in order to  
comply with local 
UAE statute
•  A statutory end of service payment is due to  
all non-UAE national employees working in the 
UAE at the end of their contracted employment.
• The Company accrues an amount each year in 
order to satisfy this indemnity when it falls due.
• The statutory payment is based on the individual’s 
number of years of service and salary level at the  
time of their departure from the Company.
• None.

fees
Core element of
remuneration,

• NEDs receive a basic annual fee and receive 
additional fees in respect of other Board duties 
such as chairmanship of Board Committees and 
acting as the Senior Independent Director or for 
a time commitment significantly in excess of 
what was expected at the start of the year.
• The Non-executive Chairman receives an 
all-inclusive fee for the role.
• The remuneration of the Non-executive 
Chairman is set by the Committee.
• The Board as a whole is responsible for 
determining NED fees, although the  
Non-executive Directors do not take part in  
any discussions regarding their fees. These  
fees are the sole element of NED remuneration. 
NEDs are not eligible for annual bonus, share 
incentives, pensions or other benefits.
• Fees are typically reviewed annually.
• Expenses incurred in the performance of duties 
for the Company may be reimbursed or paid  
for directly by the Company, as appropriate, 
including any tax due on the payments.
• Fees are set at a level which is considered 
appropriate to attract and retain the calibre  
of individual required by the Company.

annually and pay-out levels are 
determined by the Committee based 
on performance against those targets.
• Delivery in cash.
• Where participants have not reached

Petrofac shares until the guideline  
is reached.
• Clawback provisions apply

.
• Maximum bonus 
opportunity of 200%  
of basic salary.
• The precise bonus targets are set by the Committee 
each year, taking into account a number of internal 
and external reference points, including the 
Company’s key strategic objectives for the year.
• When setting these targets, the Committee ensures 
that they are appropriately stretching in the context  
of the business plan and that there is an appropriate 
balance between incentivising Executive Directors to 
meet financial targets for the year and to deliver 
specific non-financial, strategic, operational and 
personal goals. This balance allows the Committee  
to effectively reward performance against the key 
elements of our strategy.
• Measures used typically include (but are not limited to):
 – HSE and integrity measures;
 – financial measures;
 – Group and/or business service line strategic  
and operational performance measures; and
 – people-related measures.
• The weighting of the above measures will be 
determined by the Committee each year to reflect  
the strategic objectives for the relevant year. Normally, 
at least 60% of the bonus will be based on financial 
measures, but the Committee will keep this under 
review on an annual basis.
• Typically, 30% of the maximum opportunity is paid  
for ‘threshold’ performance, i.e. the minimum level  
of performance which results in a payment.

expected to build up a shareholding  
of 300% of base salary. The other

• Until the relevant shareholding 
guidelines have been met, Executive 
Directors are required to invest 33%  
of their post-tax bonus into Petrofac 
shares and to hold any vested 
post-tax PSP or Restricted Share  
Plan shares.

• Awards are normally made in the

Awards may also be satisfied in cash.
• Vesting of awards is dependent  
on achievement of stretching

over a period of at least three years.
• In addition, the Committee must be 
satisfied that the vesting outcome is  
a genuine reflection of the underlying 
Company performance over the 
period and may reduce or cancel 
vesting if it considers it appropriate.
• Additional shares are accrued in lieu  
of dividends paid on any shares  
which vest.
• Any vested post-tax shares will 
normally be subject to an additional 
two-year holding period.
• All PSP awards incorporate malus

• The Committee may adjust or amend 
the terms of the awards in accordance 
with the plan rules.
• The maximum award 
that can be granted in 
respect of a financial 
year of the Company 
under the PSP is 200% 
of basic salary (or in 
circumstances which 
the Committee deems 
to be exceptional, 
awards up to 300%  
of base salary can  
be granted).
• Awards vest based on performance against stretching 
performance targets. The ultimate goal of the 
Company’s strategy is to deliver long-term sustainable 
returns to shareholders. The Committee strives to do 
this by aligning the performance measures under the 
PSP with the long-term strategy of the Company and 
considers that strong performance under the chosen 
measures should result in sustainable value creation.
• Measures used typically include (but are not limited to):
 – shareholder return measures – a measure of the 
ultimate delivery of shareholder returns. This 
promotes alignment between Executive Director 
reward and shareholders’ interests
 – strategic measures – aligned with the Company’s 
long-term strategy and
 – financial measures – to reflect the financial 
performance of our business and a direct and 
focused measure of Company success
 – the weighting of the above measures will be 
determined by the Committee each year to reflect 
the strategic objectives of the relevant year.
• For ‘threshold’ levels of performance, 25% of the 
award vests, increasing to 100% of the award for 
maximum performance.
• The Committee may amend the performance 
conditions applicable to an award if events happen 
which cause the Committee to consider that they  
have become unfair or impractical, provided that  
the amended performance conditions would be 
materially less difficult to satisfy.
1  The Committee may, in the event of any variation of the Company’s share capital, demerger, delisting, or other event which may affect the value of awards, adjust or amend the terms  
of awards in accordance with the rules of the relevant share plan.
2  The Committee may require repayment of amounts received under the annual bonus for a period of two years following payment and may reduce or cancel unvested PSP awards  
or require repayment of amounts already paid out at any time up to the second anniversary of the vesting date of the relevant award, in a number of specific circumstances.  
These circumstances include: material misstatement of financial results; material failure of risk management; material breach of any relevant health and safety or environment regulations; 
and serious reputational damage to the Company (or any Group member) occurring during the vesting period. For the 2017 annual bonus award made to Ayman Asfari and Marwan 
Chedid, it has been agreed that an indefinite clawback provision be put in place in the event that either party be found guilty of a charge as a direct result of the SFO investigation.
Notes to the policy table
Legacy matters
The Committee can make remuneration payments and payments for loss of office outside the Policy set out above where the terms  
of the payment were agreed (i) before 15 May 2014 (the date Petrofac’s first policy came into effect); (ii) before the Policy set out in this 
report came into effect, provided the terms of the payment were consistent with the previous policy in force at the time they were 
agreed; or (iii) at a time when the relevant individual was not a Director of the Company (provided that, in the opinion of the Committee, 
the payment was not in consideration for the individual becoming a Director of the Company). This includes the exercise of any 
discretion available to the Committee in connection with such payments. For these purposes, payments include the Committee 
satisfying awards of variable remuneration and, in relation to an award over shares, the terms of the payment are agreed at the time  
the award is granted.
Minor amendments
The Committee may make minor amendments to the policy set out above (for regulatory, exchange control, tax or administrative 
purposes or to take account of a change in legislation) without obtaining shareholder approval for that amendment.
Petrofac Annual report and accounts 2017 / 105
Governance Directors’ responsibilities
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report and 
the Financial Statements in accordance with applicable law and 
regulations. The Directors have chosen to prepare the financial 
statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting 
Standards (IFRS). The Directors are also responsible for the 
preparation of the Directors’ remuneration report, which they have 
chosen to prepare, being under no obligation to do so under 
Jersey law. The Directors are also responsible for the preparation 
of the corporate governance report under the UK Listing Rules.
Jersey Company law (the ‘Law’) requires the Directors to prepare 
financial statements for each financial period in accordance with 
generally accepted accounting principles. The financial statements 
are required by law to give a true and fair view of the state of affairs 
of the Company at the period end and of the profit or loss of the 
Company for the period then ended. In preparing these financial 
statements, the Directors should:
• Select suitable accounting policies and then apply  
them consistently
• Make judgements and estimates that are reasonable
• Specify which generally accepted accounting principles  
have been adopted in their preparation and
• Prepare the financial statements on a going concern basis 
unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Company  
will continue in business
The Directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting 
records which are sufficient to show and explain the Company’s 
transactions and to disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time 
the financial position of the Company and enable them to ensure 
that the financial statements prepared by the Company comply 
with the requirements of the Law. They are also responsible for 
safeguarding the assets of the Group and Company and hence  
for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of 
fraud and other irregularities.
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of 
the corporate and financial information included on the Company’s 
website. Legislation in Jersey governing the preparation and 
dissemination of financial statements may differ from legislation  
in other jurisdictions.
Directors’ approach
The Board’s objective is to present a fair, balanced and 
understandable assessment of the Company’s position and 
prospects, particularly in the Annual Report, Half-year results 
announcement and other published documents and reports  
to regulators. The Board has established an Audit Committee  
to assist with this obligation.
Going concern
The Company’s business activities, together with the factors  
likely to affect its future development, performance and position, 
are set out in the Strategic Report on pages 10 to 21. The financial 
position of the Company, its cash flows, liquidity position and 
borrowing facilities are described in the Financial Review on pages 
42 to 45. In addition, note 33 to the financial statements includes 
the Company’s objectives, policies and processes for managing 
its capital; its financial risk management objectives; details of its 
financial instruments and hedging activities; and its exposures to 
credit risk and liquidity risk.
The Company has considerable financial resources together  
with long-term contracts with a number of customers and 
suppliers across different geographic areas and industries. As  
a consequence, the Directors believe that the Company is well 
placed to manage its business risks successfully. The Directors 
have a reasonable expectation that the Company has adequate 
resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable 
future. Thus they continue to adopt the going concern basis of 
accounting in preparing the annual financial statements.
Responsibility statement under the Disclosure  
Guidance and Transparency Rules
Each of the Directors listed on pages 68 and 69 confirms that,  
to the best of their knowledge:
• The Annual Report and Accounts, taken as a whole, is fair, 
balanced and understandable and provides the information 
necessary for shareholders to assess the Company’s position 
and performance, business model and strategy; 
• The financial statements, prepared in accordance with IFRS, 
give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position 
and profit of the Company and the undertakings included in the 
consolidation taken as a whole; and
• The Strategic Report contained on pages 2 to 65 includes a fair 
review of the development and performance of the business 
and the position of the Company and the undertakings included 
in the consolidation taken as a whole, together with a 
description of the principal risks and uncertainties that they face.

Basis for opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on 
Auditing (UK) (ISAs (UK)) and applicable law. Our responsibilities under 
those standards are further described in the Auditor’s responsibilities for 
the audit of the financial statements section of our report below. We are 
independent of the Group and parent company in accordance with the 
ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the financial 
statements in the UK, including the FRC’s Ethical Standard as applied to 
listed entities, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in 
accordance with these requirements.
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and 
appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.
Use of our report
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body, in 
accordance with Article 113A of the Companies (Jersey) Law 1991 and 
our engagement letter dated 21 November 2017 . Our audit work has been 
undertaken so that we might state to the company’s members those 
matters we are required to state to them in an auditor’s report and for no 
other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or 
assume responsibility to anyone other than the company and the 
company’s members as a body, for our audit work, for this report,  
or for the opinions we have formed.
Conclusions relating to principal risks,  
going concern and viability statement
We have nothing to report in respect of the following information in the 
annual report, in relation to which the ISAs (UK) require us to report to you 
whether we have anything material to add or draw attention to:
• the disclosures in the annual report set out on page 29 that describe the 
principal risks and explain how they are being managed or mitigated;
• the directors’ confirmation set out on page 77 in the annual report that 
they have carried out a robust assessment of the principal risks facing 
the entity, including those that would threaten its business model, 
future performance, solvency or liquidity;
• the directors’ statement set out on page 106 in the annual report about 
whether they considered it appropriate to adopt the going concern 
basis of accounting in preparing them, and their identification of any 
material uncertainties to the entity’s ability to continue to do so over a 
period of at least twelve months from the date of approval of the 
financial statements;
• whether the directors’ statement in relation to going concern required 
under the Listing Rules is materially inconsistent with our knowledge 
obtained in the audit; or
• the directors’ explanation set out on page 28 in the annual report as to 
how they have assessed the prospects of the entity, over what period 
they have done so and why they consider that period to be 
appropriate, and their statement as to whether they have a reasonable 
expectation that the entity will be able to continue in operation and 
meet its liabilities as they fall due over the period of their assessment, 
including any related disclosures drawing attention to any necessary 
qualifications or assumptions.
Overview of our audit approach
Key audit  
matters
• Revenue and margin recognition on the portfolio  
of contracts within the Group
• Impairment and fair value charges on IES assets
• Business combinations in IES and the JSD6000  
asset held for sale
• Recoverability of deferred tax assets and  
assessment of tax exposure provisions
• The potential impact of the SFO investigation
Audit  
scope
• We performed an audit of the complete financial 
information of 5 components, including Group 
consolidation adjustments, and audit procedures  
on specific balances for a further 3 components.
• The components where we performed full or specific 
audit procedures accounted for 90% of adjusted profit 
before tax, 96% of revenue and 86% of total assets.
Materiality • Group materiality was US$24m, which represents 5%  
of adjusted profit before tax.
Key audit matters
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement, 
were of most significance in our audit of the financial statements of the 
current period and include the most significant assessed risks of material 
misstatement (whether or not due to fraud) that we identified. These 
matters included those which had the greatest effect on: the overall audit 
strategy, the allocation of resources in the audit; and directing the efforts of 
the engagement team. These matters were addressed in the context of 
our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in our opinion 
thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.

Report (page 86); Significant 
accounting policies and 
judgements (pages 125 to 126); 
and Note 4a of the Consolidated 
financial statements (page 135)
E&C
Accounting for E&C long term 
contracts requires significant 
management judgement and 
estimation which increases the 
risk of bias or error.
Judgement is applied in 
recognising variation orders, 
project costs-to-complete, cost 
contingencies and provisions for 
liquidated damages. These 
judgements are also subject to 
the risk of management override 
of controls in place.
Revenue in this segment totalled 
US$4.8bn in 2017 (2016: 
US$5.9bn)
Revenue and margin recognition 
in the other two segments is 
lower risk for the reasons 
described below:
EPS
EPS operation and maintenance 
contracts are primarily 
reimbursable with a stable 
margin. This segment involves a 
high volume of sales and cost 
transactions which in total amount 
to material revenue to the Group.
Revenue in this segment totalled 
US$1.4bn in 2017 (2016: 
US$1.7bn).
IES
The majority of revenue in this 
segment arises from the Group’s 
operations in Mexico and 
Malaysia, where revenue is 
recognised on tariff based 
structure and entitlement basis 
respectively. There is limited 
judgement involved in the 
determination of revenue 
recognition for these assets, 
however a residual risk remains 
as a result of the materiality of the 
amounts recorded.
Revenue in this segment totalled 
US$0.2bn in 2017 (2016: 
US$0.3bn).
We performed full and specific scope audit procedures over this 
risk area in 5 locations, which covered 96% of total revenue.
E&C
The component audit team based in the United Arab Emirates 
(UAE) with close oversight from the Group audit engagement 
team performed the following procedures on the identified  
risk areas:
• Recognition and timing of variation orders (VOs). We made 
enquiries of management and project directors. We 
corroborated what we were told by inspection of minutes of 
meetings and other documentation. We challenged both the 
probability of claims being approved and management’s 
assessment of the value assigned to the variation order. For 
older claims we considered the actions being taken to finalise 
amounts outstanding. For reversal of variation orders we 
obtained an understanding the commercial negotiations that 
are ongoing with the client and challenged management on 
maintaining recognition of the claims that have been subject 
to partial reversals.
• Provision for liquidated damages. Our procedures involved 
discussions with management and project directors to 
understand the status of the project, the tone from the 
contracting client in terms of imposing any contractual 
penalties and corroborating the above through inspection of 
the relevant documentation and correspondence. Where it is 
management’s expectation that the contract will not be 
delivered on time, we understand the cause of the delays. We 
assess the extent to which these circumstances constitute a 
failure to fulfil the contract terms by Petrofac or the customer.
• The adequacy of contingency provisions. We verified whether 
provision releases were recorded in line with Group 
accounting policy. We analysed contingency movements 
throughout the life of the contract, and discussed progress to 
date and identified risks and challenges on contracts with 
individual project directors to determine whether the 
remaining contingency was sufficient to cover residual risks 
on the project.
• Determination of the percentage of completion. We obtained 
an understanding of progress as agreed with the customers 
and systems in place to split the contracts into component 
parts. We analysed the impact of VOs in establishing 
completion percentage.
• Assessment of costs-to-complete. We tested controls 
around the cost estimation process, tested the historical 
accuracy of previous forecasts and discussed with project 
directors and cost controllers. We also verified that costs 
were correctly accrued at period end and costs-to-complete 
accurately reflected productivity and latest actual cost rates.
EPS
We designed procedures to gain comfort that revenue was 
recognised in the correct period, which primarily included 
vouching transactions through the year with particular focus on 
transactions around the balance sheet date and sales accruals.
IES
For the Malaysian operations, we reconciled oil volumes per 
Petrofac’s field entitlement to revenue recognised in the year.  
For tariff based remuneration structures in Mexico, we vouched 
monthly revenue to the production data reports which determine 
revenue under the contract.
We reported that revenue and margin 
recognition on long term contracts has 
been correctly accounted for under IAS 
11. We are satisfied that VO, contingency 
and LD accounting complies with IFRS 
and the company’s accounting policy has 
been applied consistently.
We have also ensured the risks associated 
with revenue recognition have been 
appropriately disclosed in Note 2 to the 
financial statements with respect to 
significant estimates.
We had nothing to report to the Audit 
Committee in respect of the revenue  
in the EPS and IES segments.

Financial statements Risk Our response to the risk
Key observations communicated  
to the Audit Committee
Impairment and fair value charges  
on IES assets
Refer to the Audit Committee Report (page 86); 
Significant accounting policies and judgements 
(pages 125 to 126); and Note 5 of the Consolidated 
financial statements (page 120)
At 31 December 2017 , assets related to the IES 
segment had a total carrying value of US$1.0bn 
excluding working capital (2016: US$1.2bn). 
Impairment charges and fair value re-
measurements were recorded against IES assets 
of US$245m in 2017 (2016: US$272m).
The valuation of certain assets are sensitive to the 
eventual outcome of commercial negotiations with 
the respective National Oil Companies (NOCs) in 
the geographies where they are located. The 
assessment of the likely commercial outcomes on 
these assets is a key judgement.
The recoverable amount of each IES asset is 
supported by a discounted cashflow model, which 
primarily depends on internally generated 
information such as future operating and capital 
expenditure and production profiles.
Other relevant judgements include the oil and gas 
price forecasts, and the discount rate to be applied 
to these cashflow forecasts.
We gained an understanding of the basis for 
key judgements in respect of the outcome of 
commercial negotiations. We obtained details 
of the progress made during the year through 
discussions with IES management and 
corroboration to supporting evidence, including 
correspondence with the NOCs, that these 
negotiations were ongoing. 
The Group audit team performed audit 
procedures on the discounted cashflow 
forecasts for those IES assets where 
impairment indicators existed:
We compared forecast oil and gas price curves 
with market data, and assessed for 
reasonableness the longer term oil and gas 
prices assumptions;
We compared planned future operating and 
capital expenditure and production profiles with 
those used in prior periods and met with the 
Group’s reserves assurance team to 
understand their objectivity and expertise in 
reviewing the internally generated forecasts;
We used an internal EY valuation specialist to 
assist with our consideration of the discount rate.
We concluded that the impairments and 
fair value charges on IES assets were 
appropriately determined.
We have reviewed and concur with the 
disclosure of significant estimation 
uncertainty in relation to the Mexican 
PECs, Panuco contingent consideration 
and Malaysia PM304 assets, presented in 
Note 2 to the financial statements.
Business combinations in IES
1
  
and the JSD6000 asset held for sale
Refer to the Audit Committee Report (page 86); 
and Notes 10 and 14 of the Consolidated financial 
statements (pages 140 and 145)
In September 2017 Petrofac acquired a 20% 
ownership interest in the GSA oil and gas field in 
the UK North Sea, and in December 2017 Petrofac 
migrated the Santuario PEC in Mexico to a PSC.
There is judgement required in applying IFRS 11 
‘ Joint arrangements’ and IFRS 3 ‘Business 
combinations’ to these transactions, and therefore 
a risk of error in the relevant fair value 
measurements and presentation of the 
transactions in the financial statements.
JSD6000
Petrofac has reclassified the vessel from assets 
under construction to assets held for sale, since 
the vessel’s carrying amount is expected to be 
recovered principally through a disposal 
transaction within the next 12 months. There is a 
judgement involved in determining whether the sale 
is highly probable, and whether the fair value less 
costs of disposal of the vessel is lower than its 
carrying value.
After recording an impairment charge of US$176m, 
the JSD6000 had a carrying value of US$217m at 
31 December 2017 .
The Group audit team reviewed the joint 
operating agreements for both Santuario and 
GSA to assess whether the partners have a 
joint control over the arrangement, and whether 
the rights and obligations obtained meet the 
definition of a joint operation.
We assessed whether the acquisition method 
of accounting was correctly applied in 
accounting for business combinations.
We corroborated inputs to the discounted 
cashflow models used to determine the fair 
value of consideration and also the fair value of 
assets and liabilities acquired in each 
transaction. The nature and extent of 
procedures performed on the related 
discounted cashflow models supporting fair 
value is presented in the section Impairment 
and fair value charges on IES assets above.
JSD6000
We discussed the terms of the proposed 
transaction with management and obtained 
meeting minutes to confirm that the Board had 
resolved to sell the vessel.
We agreed the estimated sales price and terms 
of proposed sales transaction to relevant 
documentation and inspected correspondence 
between the counterparties to validate the intent 
to execute the disposal in the next 12 months.
We are satisfied that Petrofac’s interest in 
GSA and Santuario meet the criteria to be 
accounted for as joint operations, and the 
nature of both transactions also meet the 
criteria to apply business combination 
accounting.
We also concur with the fair values of the 
consideration, the assets and liabilities 
acquired, and the related disclosures 
presented in the financial statements in 
note 10. For the JSD6000, we concurred 
with the impairment recorded upon 
reclassification to held for sale.
We concluded that the results of 
impairment and fair value re-
measurements in respect of IES assets 
and the JSD6000 have been properly 
reflected in the financial statements. 
JSD6000 is properly classified as an asset 
held for sale under IFRS.
110 / Petrofac Annual report and accounts 2017
INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT  
TO THE MEMBERS OF PETROFAC LIMITED
CONTINUED Risk Our response to the risk
Key observations communicated  
to the Audit Committee
Recoverability of deferred tax assets and 
assessment of tax exposure provisions
Refer to the Audit Committee report (page 86); 
Significant accounting policies and judgements 
(page 126); and note 7 of the Consolidated financial 
statements (page 138)
The wide geographical spread of the Group’s 
operations, the complexity of application of local 
tax rules in many different jurisdictions and transfer 
pricing risks affecting the allocation of income and 
costs charged between jurisdictions and 
businesses increases the risk of misstatement of 
tax balances.
The assessment of tax exposures by management 
requires judgement given the structure of individual 
contracts and the increasing activity of tax 
authorities in the jurisdictions in which Petrofac 
operates.
Furthermore, the recognition of deferred tax assets 
and liabilities needs to be assessed regularly to 
ensure that any changes in local tax laws and 
profitability of associated contracts are 
appropriately considered.
We utilised taxation specialists in our London 
team to assist the Group audit team in 
identifying jurisdictions to be included in audit 
scope. We also involved local tax specialists in 
the relevant jurisdictions where we deemed it 
necessary to address specific local tax matters.
We identified tax exposures estimated by 
management, including those arising on 
business combinations, and gained an 
understanding of the risk analysis associated 
with these exposures along with claims or 
assessments made by tax authorities to date.
We also tested the basis of the computation 
and disclosure of current and deferred tax to 
ensure compliance with local tax rules and the 
Group’s accounting policies.
We evaluated management’s assessment of 
the likelihood of the realisation of deferred tax 
balances by obtaining profit forecasts for the 
relevant businesses, ensuring these were 
consistent with plans approved by the Board, 
considering past accuracy of forecasts and 
considering implications of non-recurring losses 
for future profit assumptions.
We are satisfied that the deferred tax 
assets are appropriately recognised and 
presented in the financial statements.
The provision in respect of income tax 
exposures as at 31 December 2017 of 
US$1 10m is materially consistent with the 
Group’s experience in the relevant 
jurisdictions and historical tax assessments 
concluded with the tax authorities.
SFO investigation
1
Refer to Governance Report (pages 66 and 78) 
and Consolidated financial statements (page 160)
The Company and EY are unable to determine the 
outcome of the investigation or any financial 
liabilities that might arise. Our principal reason for 
designating this a key matter is the risk to future 
order intake, customer and supplier relationships 
and banking facility renewal.
We met with Petrofac Directors, personnel and 
external legal advisers to understand the status 
of the investigation, and the nature of the 
questions being raised by the SFO. We reviewed 
minutes of relevant meetings and made 
enquiries regarding the matters documented.
With respect to going concern and viability, we 
confirmed the assumptions made in the 
business plan were appropriate and consistent 
with the Company’s risk analysis. We stress 
tested scenarios in the cash flow and profit 
forecasts related to new order intake, ability to 
refinance loans, covenant testing and the 
potential for one off loss events.
We have considered how management have 
addressed the matter and considered the need 
for further action, including any matters arising 
from work by Internal Audit.
We have reviewed the disclosures on this 
matter in the Annual Report and are 
satisfied they appropriately represent the 
Group’s activities in response to the SFO 
investigation and the current status of the 
investigation as understood by the Group.
The disclosures made in respect of going 
concern and viability are consistent with 
the results of our audit procedures on 
these matters.
1 Denotes a new key audit matter in 2017. There were no other changes in risk assessment compared to the prior year.
An overview of the scope of our audit
Tailoring the scope
Our assessment of audit risk, our evaluation of materiality and our 
allocation of performance materiality determine our audit scope for each 
entity within the Group. Taken together, this enables us to form an opinion 
on the consolidated financial statements. We take into account size, risk 
profile, the organisation of the Group and effectiveness of Group-wide 
controls, changes in the business environment and other factors such as 
recent internal audit results when assessing the level of work to be 
performed at each entity.
In assessing the risk of material misstatement to the Group financial 
statements, and to ensure we had adequate quantitative coverage of 
significant accounts in the financial statements we selected components 
covering entities within the UAE, UK, Malaysia, Mexico and Tunisia which 
represent the principal business units within the Group.
We performed an audit of the complete financial information of 5 
components (“full scope components”) which were selected based on 
their size or risk characteristics. For the remaining 3 components (“specific 
scope components”), we performed audit procedures on specific 
accounts within that component that we considered had the potential for 
the greatest impact on the significant accounts in the financial statements 
either because of the size of these accounts or their risk profile.
The reporting components where we performed audit procedures 
accounted for 90% (2016: 89%) of the Group’s adjusted PBT, 96% 
(2016: 93%) of the Group’s Revenue and 86% (2016: 80%) of the Group’s 
Total assets.
For the current year, the full scope components contributed 82% 
(2016: 95%) of the Group’s adjusted PBT, 92% (2016: 93%) of the Group’s 
Revenue and 83% (2016: 80%) of the Group’s Total assets.
Petrofac Annual report and accounts 2017 / 111
Financial statements The specific scope components contributed 8% (2016: -5%) of the 
Group’s adjusted PBT, 4% (2016: 3%) of the Group’s Revenue and 3% 
(2016: 10%) of the Group’s Total assets.
The audit scope of these components may not have included testing of all 
significant accounts of the component but will have contributed to the 
coverage of significant accounts tested for the Group. We also instructed 
one location to perform specified procedures over additions to the Greater 
Stella oil and gas asset.
Of the remaining components that together represent 10% of the Group’s 
adjusted PBT, none are individually greater than 1% of the Group’s 
adjusted PBT. For these components, we performed other procedures, 
including assessing and testing management’s Group wide controls. We 
also performed analytical review on a component basis using a risk based 
approach, and tested consolidation journals to identify the existence of, 
and respond to, any further risks of misstatement that could have been 
material to the Group financial statements.

Changes from the prior year
Our scope allocation in the current year is broadly consistent with 2016 in 
terms of overall coverage of the Group and the number of full and specific 
scope entities. As highlighted in 2016, the Group audit team is responsible 
for the audit of the Santuario and GSA business combination transactions.
Involvement with component teams
In establishing our overall approach to the Group audit, we determined the 
type of work that needed to be undertaken at each of the components by 
us, as the primary audit engagement team, or by component auditors 
from other EY global network firms operating under our instruction. Of the 
5 full scope components, audit procedures were performed on 2 of these 
directly by the primary audit team based in London, and the remaining 3 
full scope components were audited by EY global network firms in the 
UAE, Malaysia and Aberdeen, UK. For the 3 specific scope components, 
where the work was performed by component auditors, we undertook an 
appropriate level of involvement to enable us to determine that sufficient 
audit evidence had been obtained as a basis for our opinion on the  
Group as a whole.
The Group audit team continued to follow a programme of planned visits 
that has been designed to ensure that each location is subject to an 
appropriate level of senior team member oversight during key audit 
activities. The nature and extent of these visits were designed relative  
to the size of the component, and the division of responsibilities between 
the local and Group team on the significant risk areas applicable  
to the component.
During the current year’s audit cycle, visits were undertaken by the primary 
audit team to the component teams in the UAE, Malaysia and Mexico. The 
nature and extent of these visits were designed relative to the size of the 
component, and the division of responsibilities between the local and 
Group team on the significant risk areas applicable to the component. 
During the current year audit cycle, visits were undertaken by the Group 
audit team (including a Group audit partner) to the component teams in 
the UAE (two full scope and one specific scope components), Malaysia 
(one full scope component) and Mexico (one specific scope component).
The Global Team Planning Event was held in London with representatives 
of the teams from Aberdeen, UAE and Malaysia all attending by video 
conference. In addition, dependent on the timing of our visits in the audit 
cycle, our visits to components involved discussion of the audit approach 
with the component team and any issues arising from their work, 
consideration of the approach to revenue recognition, reviewing key 
working papers, attending the audit planning meeting and attending the 
audit closing meeting, including the discussion of fraud and error. In 
concluding the year-end audit the Group audit team visited the main 
operating and finance location in Sharjah, UAE to perform the audit of the 
consolidation and financial statements and to interact closely with the local 
component team. The Group audit team interacted regularly with the 
component teams where appropriate during various stages of the audit, 
reviewed key working papers and were responsible for the scope and 
direction of the audit process. This, together with the additional 
procedures performed at Group level, gave us appropriate evidence for 
our opinion on the Group financial statements.
Our application of materiality
We apply the concept of materiality in planning and performing the audit, 
in evaluating the effect of identified misstatements on the audit and in 
forming our audit opinion.
Materiality
The magnitude of an omission or misstatement that, individually or in the 
aggregate, could reasonably be expected to influence the economic 
decisions of the users of the financial statements. Materiality provides a 
basis for determining the nature and extent of our audit procedures.
We determined materiality for the Group to be US$24m (2016: US$25m), 
which is 5% (2016: 5%) of adjusted profit before tax. We believe that 
adjusting for the items described below provides us with a consistent  
year-on-year basis for determining materiality and is appropriate in the  
light of the extended decline in oil prices, and the change in Group 
strategy for IES. For 2017 , these related to exceptional items and certain 
re-measurements of US$438m (refer to note 5 of the financial statements) 
which were all subject to full scope audit procedures.
We determined materiality for the parent company to be US$12.2 million 
(2016: US$13.9 million), which is 0.5% (2016: 0.5%) of total assets.

Group’s overall control environment, our judgement was that performance 
materiality was 50% (2016: 50%) of our planning materiality, namely 
US$12.0m (2016: US$12.5m). We have set performance materiality at this 
percentage due to our past experience of the audit that indicates a higher 
risk of misstatements, both corrected and uncorrected.
Audit work at component locations for the purpose of obtaining audit 
coverage over significant financial statement accounts is undertaken 
based on a percentage of total performance materiality. The performance 
materiality set for each component is based on the relative scale and risk 
of the component to the Group as a whole and our assessment of the risk 
of misstatement at that component. In the current year, the range of 
performance materiality allocated to components was US$2.4m to 
US$10.8m (2016: US$2.5m to US$11.2m).
Reporting threshold
An amount below which identified misstatements are considered  
as being clearly trivial.
We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to them all 
uncorrected audit differences in excess of US$1.2m (2016: US$1.25m), 
which is set at 5% of planning materiality, as well as differences below that 
threshold that, in our view, warranted reporting on qualitative grounds. 
Reclassification differences are only reported to the Audit Committee 
where the difference exceeds 2% of the applicable primary financial 
statement line items.
We evaluate any uncorrected misstatements against both the quantitative 
measures of materiality discussed above and in light of other relevant 
qualitative considerations in forming our opinion.
Other information
The other information comprises the information included in the annual 
report, other than the financial statements and our auditor’s report 
thereon. The directors are responsible for the other information.
Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other 
information and, except to the extent otherwise explicitly stated in this 
report, we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.
In connection with our audit of the financial statements, our responsibility 
is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the 
other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or 
our knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially 
misstated. If we identify such material inconsistencies or apparent material 
misstatements, we are required to determine whether there is a material 
misstatement in the financial statements or a material misstatement of the 
other information. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude 
that there is a material misstatement of the other information, we are 
required to report that fact.
We have nothing to report in this regard.
In this context, we also have nothing to report in regard to our responsibility 
to specifically address the following items in the other information and to 
report as uncorrected material misstatements of the other information 
where we conclude that those items meet the following conditions:
• Fair, balanced and understandable – the statement given by the 
directors on page 106 that they consider the annual report and 
financial statements taken as a whole is fair, balanced and 
understandable and provides the information necessary for 
shareholders to assess the Group’s performance, business model and 
strategy, is materially inconsistent with our knowledge obtained in the 
audit; or
• Audit committee reporting – the section describing the work of the 
audit committee set out of pages 82 to 87 do not appropriately 
address matters communicated by us to the audit committee; or
• Directors’ statement of compliance with the UK Corporate Governance 
Code – the parts of the directors’ statement required under the Listing 
Rules relating to the company’s compliance with the UK Corporate 
Governance Code containing provisions specified for review by the 
auditor in accordance with Listing Rule 9.8.10R(2) do not properly 
disclose a departure from a relevant provision of the UK Corporate 
Governance Code.
Matters on which we are required to report  
by exception
We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters in relation to 
which the Companies (Jersey) Law 1991 requires us to report to you if,  
in our opinion:
• proper accounting records have not been kept by the company, or 
proper returns adequate for our audit have not been received from 
branches not visited by us; or
• the financial statements are not in agreement with the company’s 
accounting records and returns; or
• we have not received all the information and explanations we require 
for our audit.
Opinion on other matters, as agreed in our 
Engagement Letter
In our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of the audit:
• The part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited has been 
properly prepared in accordance with the basis of preparation  
as described therein;
• The information given in the Strategic Report and Governance Report 
is consistent with the financial statements and those reports have been 
prepared in accordance with applicable legal requirements;
• The information about internal control and risk management systems in 
relation to financial reporting processes and about share capital 
structures is consistent with the financial statements and has been 
prepared in accordance with applicable legal requirements; and
• The information about the Company’s corporate governance code and 
practices and about its administrative, management and supervisory 
bodies and their committees complies with rules 7 .2.2, 7 .2.3 and 7 .2.7 
of the FCA Rules.
Petrofac Annual report and accounts 2017 / 113
Financial statements Responsibilities of directors
As explained more fully in the directors’ responsibilities statement set out 
on page 106, the directors are responsible for the preparation of the 
financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair 
view, and for such internal control as the directors determine is necessary 
to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material 
misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
In preparing the financial statements, the directors are responsible for 
assessing the Group and parent company’s ability to continue as a going 
concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and 
using the going concern basis of accounting unless the directors either 
intend to liquidate the Group or the parent company or to cease 
operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.
Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit  
of the financial statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the 
financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, 
whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes 
our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not 
a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs (UK) will 
always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can 
arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the 
aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic 
decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.
A further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the financial 
statements is located on the Financial Reporting Council’s website at 
https://www.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities. This description forms 
part of our auditor’s report.

CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF CHANGES IN EQUITY
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2017 1 Corporate information
Petrofac Limited (the ‘Company’) is a limited liability company registered 
and domiciled in Jersey under the Companies (Jersey) Law 1991 and is 
the holding company for the international group of Petrofac subsidiaries. 
The Company’s 31 December 2017 financial statements are shown on 
pages 170 to 185. The Group’s principal activity is the provision of services 
to the oil and gas production and processing industry.
The consolidated financial statements of Petrofac Limited and its 
subsidiaries (the ‘Group’) for the year ended 31 December 2017 were 
authorised for issue in accordance with a resolution of the Board of 
Directors on 28 February 2018.
Information on the Group’s subsidiaries, associates and joint 
arrangements is contained in note 34 to these consolidated financial 
statements. Information on other related party transactions of the Group  
is provided in note 31.
2 Summary of significant accounting policies
Basis of preparation
The consolidated financial statements of the Group have been prepared in 
accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as issued 
by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) and applicable 
requirements of Jersey law.
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a historical 
cost basis, except for available-for-sale (AFS) investment, derivative financial 
instruments, financial assets held at fair value through profit and loss and 
contingent consideration that have been measured at fair value. The 
consolidated financial statements are presented in United States dollars  
and all values are rounded to the nearest million (US$m), except when 
otherwise indicated.
Presentation of results
Petrofac presents business performance, an alternative performance 
measure, in the consolidated income statement as a means of measuring 
underlying financial performance. The business performance measure 
excludes the contribution of impairments, certain re-measurements, 
restructuring and redundancy costs, contract migration costs, material 
deferred tax movements arising due to foreign exchange differences in 
jurisdictions where tax is computed based on the functional currency of 
the country and material forward rate movements in Kuwaiti dinar forward 
currency contracts. The intention of this measure is to provide readers with 
a clear and consistent presentation of underlying business performance.
Adoption of new financial reporting standards, amendments  
and interpretations
Effective new financial reporting amendments
The Group has adopted amendments issued by the International 
Accounting Standards Board (IASB) and the International Financial 
Reporting Interpretations Committee (IFRIC) of the IASB that are relevant 
to its operations and effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 
1 January 2017 . These were:
• Amendments to IAS 7 Statement of Cash Flows: Disclosure Initiative
• Amendments to IAS 12 Income Taxes: Recognition of Deferred Tax 
Assets for Unrealised Losses
These amendments did not have a material impact on the Group’s 
financial performance or position. However, the disclosures required  
by IAS 7 have been provided in note 18 on page 150. No comparative 
information is presented as it is not mandatory in the first year  
of application.
Financial reporting standards and amendments issued  
but not yet effective
Standards issued but not yet effective up to the date of issuance of the 
Group’s consolidated financial statements are listed below and include 
only those standards and amendments that are likely to have an impact  
on the financial performance, position and disclosures of the Group  
at a future date. The Group intends to adopt these standards when  
they become effective.
IFRS 9 Financial Instruments
IFRS 9 brings together all three aspects of the accounting for financial 
instruments: classification and measurement, impairment and hedge 
accounting. IFRS 9 is effective for annual periods beginning on or after  
1 January 2018, with early application permitted. Except for hedge 
accounting, retrospective application is required but providing 
comparative information is not compulsory. For hedge accounting,  
the requirements are generally applied prospectively, with some  
limited exceptions.
The Group plans to adopt the new standard on the required effective  
date and will not restate comparative information. During 2017 , the Group 
performed a detailed impact assessment of all three aspects of IFRS 9. This 
assessment is based on currently available information and may  
be subject to changes arising from further reasonable and supportable 
information being made available to the Group during 2018 when the Group 
adopts the standard. Overall, the Group expects no significant impact on its 
consolidated statement of financial position except for the effect of applying 
the impairment requirements of IFRS 9. The Group does not expect the 
transition adjustment impact at 1 January 2018 to be material. 
Classification and measurement
The Group does not expect a significant impact on its consolidated 
statement of financial position on applying the classification and 
measurement requirements of IFRS 9. It expects to continue measuring  
at fair value all financial assets currently held at fair value.
Impairment
IFRS 9 requires the Group to record expected credit losses on all 
applicable financial assets e.g. loans and receivables, trade receivables, 
retention receivables, work-in-progress and bank balances, either on a 
12-month or lifetime basis. The Group will apply the simplified approach 
and record lifetime expected losses on all loans and receivables, trade 
receivables, retention receivables, work-in-progress and bank balances. 
The Group has determined that, due to a change in the loss allowance 
recognition from an incurred loss model to an expected credit loss model 
and the impairment requirements under IFRS 9 being applied for the first 
time to its retention receivables and work-in-progress balances, the initial 
application of the standard will not have a material impact on the opening 
retained earnings at 1 January 2018.
Hedge accounting
The Group has determined that all existing hedge relationships that are 
currently designated in effective hedging relationships will continue to 
qualify for hedge accounting under IFRS 9. The Group has chosen not to 
retrospectively apply IFRS 9 on transition to the hedges where the Group 
excluded the forward points from the hedge designation under IAS 39. As 
IFRS 9 does not change the general principles of how an entity accounts 
for effective hedges, applying the hedging requirements of IFRS 9 will not 
have a significant impact on the Group’s financial statements.
The new standard also introduces expanded disclosure requirements and 
changes in presentation. These are expected to change the nature and 
extent of the Group’s disclosures about its financial instruments 
particularly in the year of the adoption of the new standard.
120 / Petrofac Annual report and accounts 2017
NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2017 IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers
IFRS 15 establishes a five-step model to account for revenue arising from 
contracts with customers. Under IFRS 15, revenue is recognised at an 
amount that reflects the consideration to which an entity expects to be 
entitled in exchange for transferring goods or services to a customer.
The Group completed its detailed analysis in 2017 although this 
assessment is based on currently available information and may be 
subject to changes arising from further reasonable and supportable 
information being made available to the Group during the first half of 2018. 
The Group does not expect the transition adjustment impact at 1 January 
2018 to be material. 
The Group plans to adopt the new standard on 1 January 2018 using the 
modified retrospective method.
Rendering of services
The Group provides lump-sum engineering, procurement and 
construction project execution services and reimbursable engineering and 
production services to the oil and gas production and processing industry.
Lump-sum engineering, procurement and construction  
project execution services
The Group currently accounts for lump-sum engineering, procurement 
and construction project execution services contracts as a single 
performance obligation and recognises revenue by reference to the  
stage of completion method (output method), based on surveys of work 
performed once the outcome of a contract can be estimated reliably. 
Variation orders and claims are only included in revenue when it is 
probable that these will be accepted and can be measured reliably (see 
current revenue recognition policies on page 127). The Group provides  
for liquidated damages claims where the customer has the contractual 
right to apply liquidated damages and it is considered probable that the 
customer will successfully pursue such a claim. 
For its lump-sum engineering, procurement and construction project 
execution services contracts, the Group has reached the following main 
conclusions when applying IFRS 15 to its current project portfolio at  
1 January 2018:
• Lump-sum engineering, procurement and construction project 
execution services contracts contain distinct goods and services  
but these are not distinct in the context of the contract. It is therefore 
appropriate to combine the services into a single performance 
obligation which is consistent with the current accounting treatment
• Services are satisfied over time given that the customer simultaneously 
receives and consumes the benefits provided by the Group. 
Consequently, under IFRS 15 the Group will continue to recognise 
revenue from its lump-sum engineering, procurement and construction 
project execution services contracts over time rather than at a point  
of time
• Contract modifications, e.g. variation orders, will be accounted for as 
part of the existing contract, with a cumulative catch up adjustment  
to revenue. For material contract modifications, based on 
management’s assessment, a separate contract may be recognised  
in line with current practice
• Variable consideration, e.g. variation orders, claims and liquidated 
damages, will be assessed at contract inception and re-assessed at 
each reporting period using the expected outcome approach. The 
requirement to estimate variable consideration at contract inception  
is new, and its application will not result in any significant impact to 
opening retained earnings at 1 January 2018. This new requirement 
could however alter the amount and timing of revenue and margin 
recognition in future reporting periods depending upon the facts and 
circumstances of individual contracts
• No risk adjustment will be applied to the survey of work performed 
percentage-of-completion since IFRS 15 requires that revenue is 
recognised when control of a good or service transfers to the 
customer. This will result in revenue and margin being recognised 
earlier in future reporting periods 
• Contract costs are currently recognised in the consolidated income 
statement by reference to percentage-of-completion. IFRS 15 does not 
prescribe the accounting for contract costs and therefore management 
will estimate cost accruals to arrive at the total contract costs to be 
recognised in the consolidated income statement. Estimating these 
cost accruals may result in a greater degree of margin variability 
between reporting periods
• Percentage-of-completion based thresholds for initial margin 
recognition will continue to be applied. Management believes these 
thresholds allow a reasonable measurement of the performance 
obligation outcome to be performed and margin to be recognised. 
Revenue, only to the extent of the costs incurred, will be recognised 
until percentage-of-completion based thresholds are met 
• The advance payments for lump-sum engineering, procurement and 
construction project execution services contracts are structured 
primarily for reasons other than the provision of finance to the Group, 
and they do not provide customers with an alternative to pay in arrears. 
In addition, the length of time between when the customer pays and 
the Group transfers goods and services to the customer is relatively 
short. Therefore, the Group has concluded that there is not a 
significant financing component within such contracts. Currently, the 
Group does not have any contracts where payments by customer are 
over a number of years after the Group has transferred goods and 
services to the customer; if such cases arise in future the transaction 
price for such contracts will be determined by discounting the  
amount of promised consideration using an appropriate discount rate
• The Group concluded that it operates as principal in all its lump-sum 
engineering, procurement and construction project execution  
services contracts
• Pre-contract/bid costs are currently recognised as an expense until 
there is a high probability that the contract will be awarded. The Group 
currently capitalises pre-contract/bid costs, where such costs are 
incremental to the contract and are expected to be recovered, as an 
asset and will expense it over the life of the contract. This is in line with 
the requirements of IFRS 15 therefore no material change is expected
• IFRS 15 requires contract assets and contract liabilities for individual 
customers to be presented on a net basis. This will impact the 
presentation of these contract assets and contract liabilities in the 
consolidated statement of financial position 
Reimbursable engineering and production services
The Group currently recognises service revenue for its reimbursable 
engineering and production services contracts as and when the services 
are rendered based on the agreed contract schedule of rates. Incentive 
payments are included in revenue when the contract is sufficiently 
advanced that it is probable that the specified performance standards will 
be met or exceeded and the amount of the incentive payments can be 
measured reliably (see current revenue recognition policies on page 127). 
For its reimbursable engineering and production services contracts, the 
Group has reached the following main conclusions when applying IFRS 15  
to its current project portfolio at 1 January 2018: 
• Services are satisfied over time given that the customer simultaneously 
receives and consumes the benefits provided by the Group. 
Consequently, under IFRS 15 the Group will continue to recognise 
revenue from its reimbursable engineering and production services 
contracts over time rather than at a point of time using the input 
method for measuring progress towards complete satisfaction of  
the performance obligation
Petrofac Annual report and accounts 2017 / 121
Financial statements 2 Summary of significant accounting policies 
continued
• Distinct performance obligations based on the assessment that the 
service is capable of being distinct both individually and within the 
context of the contract. The Group currently accounts for reimbursable 
engineering and production services contracts as separate 
deliverables of bundled sales, as generally the contract includes 
separate transaction prices for each performance obligation. If not the 
Group allocates consideration between these deliverables using the 
relative stand-alone prices and recognises service revenue as and 
when the services are rendered. The Group does not expect any 
impact on revenue as the current revenue recognition policy is 
consistent with the requirements under IFRS 15
• Contract modifications will be accounted for as a separate contract or 
as part of an existing contract depending on facts and circumstances. 
The current policy is consistent with IFRS 15 requirements and revenue 
recognition is not expected to be impacted 
• Incentive payments (referred to as ‘variable consideration’ under  
IFRS 15) will be estimated at contract inception and at the end of  
each reporting period using the single most likely outcome approach. 
The impact is unlikely to be significant as the expected change will  
not be material
• The Group will continue its assessment of when the outcome of a 
contract can be estimated reliably for recognising margin, as the 
current policy is in line with the requirements of IFRS 15
• The Group does not generally receive advances from customers for  
its reimbursable engineering and production services contracts. If 
advances are received these will only be short-term. The Group has 
concluded that in such cases it will use the practical expedient 
provided in IFRS 15, and will not adjust the promised amount of the 
consideration for the effects of a significant financing components in 
the contracts, where the Group expects at contract inception that the 
period between the Group transfer of a promised good or service to  
a customer and when the customer pays for that good or service will 
be one year or less. Therefore, for short-term advances, the Group will 
not account for a financing component even if it is a significant amount
• The Group has concluded that it operates as principal in all its 
reimbursable engineering and production services contracts.
• Currently, material pre-contract/bid costs that relate directly to the 
contract and are expected to be recovered are capitalised as an  
asset and expensed over the life of the contract which is consistent 
with the new requirements
Sale of goods
Contracts with customers in which the sale of crude oil is expected to be 
the only performance obligation will not have any impact on the Group’s 
profit or loss upon adoption of IFRS 15. The Group expects the revenue 
recognition to occur at a point in time when control of the goods is 
transferred to the customer, generally on delivery of the goods.
The Group’s Equity Upstream Investments and Production Enhancement 
Contracts are not expected to be affected by the adoption of IFRS 15.
Warranty obligations
The Group provides warranties to customers with assurance that the 
related product will function as the parties intended because it complies 
with agreed-upon specifications. The Group does not provide warranties 
as a service, in addition to the assurance that the product complies with 
agreed-upon specifications, in its contracts with customers. As such,  
the Group expects that such warranties will be assurance-type  
warranties which will continue to be accounted for under IAS 37 
Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets consistent  
with its current practice.
Presentation and disclosure requirements
The presentation and disclosure requirements in IFRS 15 are more 
detailed than under current IFRS. The presentation requirements 
represent a significant change from current practice and significantly 
increase the volume of disclosures required in the Group’s financial 
statements. Many of the disclosure requirements in IFRS 15 are new  
and the Group has assessed that the impact of some of these disclosure 
requirements will be significant. The Group expects that the notes to  
the financial statements will be expanded because of the disclosure of 
significant judgements. In addition, as required by IFRS 15, the Group  
will disaggregate revenue recognised from contracts with customers  
into categories that depict how the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty 
of revenue and cash flows are affected by economic factors. In 2017 , the 
Group continued preparing and testing the appropriate systems, internal 
controls, policies and procedures necessary to collect and disclose the 
required information.
IFRS 16 Leases
IFRS 16 was issued in January 2016 and it replaces IAS 17 Leases,  
IFRIC 4 Determining whether an Arrangement contains a Lease, SIC-15 
Operating Leases-Incentives and SIC-27 Evaluating the Substance of 
Transactions Involving the Legal Form of a Lease. IFRS 16 sets out the 
principles for the recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure 
of leases and requires lessees to account for all leases under a single 
on-balance sheet model similar to the accounting for finance leases under 
IAS 17 . The standard includes two recognition exemptions for lessees – 
leases of ‘low-value’ assets (e.g. personal computers) and short-term 
leases (e.g. leases with a lease term of 12 months or less). At the 
commencement date of a lease, a lessee will recognise a liability to make 
lease payments (i.e. the lease liability) and an asset representing the right 
to use the underlying asset during the lease term (i.e. the right-of-use 
asset). Lessees will be required to separately recognise the interest 
expense on the lease liability and the depreciation expense on the 
right-of-use asset.
Lessees will be also required to remeasure the lease liability upon the 
occurrence of certain events (e.g. a change in the lease term, a change  
in future lease payments resulting from a change in an index or rate used 
to determine those payments). The lessee will generally recognise the 
amount of the re-measurement of the lease liability as an adjustment to 
the right-of-use asset.
Lessor accounting under IFRS 16 is substantially unchanged from today’s 
accounting under IAS 17 . Lessors will continue to classify all leases using 
the same classification principle as in IAS 17 and distinguish between two 
types of leases: operating and finance leases.
IFRS 16 also requires lessees and lessors to make more extensive 
disclosures than under IAS 17 .
IFRS 16 is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2019. 
Early application is permitted, but not before an entity applies IFRS 15.  
A lessee can choose to apply the standard using either a full retrospective  
or a modified retrospective approach. The standard’s transition provisions 
permit certain reliefs.
In 2018, the Group will continue to assess the potential effect of IFRS 16 
on its consolidated financial statements and intends to adopt the standard 
at the required effective date.
Amendments to IFRS 10 and IAS 28: Sale or Contribution of 
Assets between an Investor and its Associate or Joint Venture
The amendments address the conflict between IFRS 10 and IAS 28 in 
dealing with the loss of control of a subsidiary that is sold or contributed  
to an associate or joint venture. The amendments clarify that the gain or 
loss resulting from the sale or contribution of assets that constitute a 
business, as defined in IFRS 3, between an investor and its associate or 
joint venture, is recognised in full. Any gain or loss resulting from the sale 
or contribution of assets that do not constitute a business, however, is

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2017
CONTINUED recognised only to the extent of unrelated investors’ interests in the 
associate or joint venture. The IASB has deferred the effective date of 
these amendments indefinitely, but if early adopted the amendments must 
be applied prospectively. These amendments will be applied in the future 
when applicable.
Basis of consolidation
The consolidated financial statements comprise the financial statements  
of Petrofac Limited (the ‘Company’) and entities controlled by the 
Company (its subsidiaries) as at 31 December 2017 . Control is achieved 
when the Group is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its 
involvement with the investee and has the ability to affect those returns 
through its power over the investee.
Generally, there is a presumption that a majority of voting rights results in 
control. To support this presumption, and when the Group has less than a 
majority of the voting or similar rights of an investee, the Group considers 
all relevant facts and circumstances in assessing whether it has power 
over an investee, including: 
• Contractual arrangements with the other vote holders of the investee
• Rights arising from other contractual arrangements
• Voting rights and potential voting rights the Group
The Group re-assesses whether or not it controls an investee if facts and 
circumstances indicate that there are changes to one or more of the three 
elements of control. Consolidation of a subsidiary begins when the Group 
obtains control over the subsidiary and ceases when the Group loses control 
of the subsidiary. Assets, liabilities, income and expenses of a subsidiary 
acquired or disposed of during the reporting period are included in the 
consolidated statement of other comprehensive income from the date the 
Group gains control until the date the Group ceases to control the subsidiary.
Profit or loss and each component of other comprehensive income  
(OCI) are attributed to the Petrofac Limited shareholders and to the 
non-controlling interests, even if this results in the non-controlling interests 
having a deficit balance. When necessary, adjustments are made to the 
financial statements of subsidiaries to bring their accounting policies into 
line with the Group’s accounting policies.
All intra-group transactions, balances, income and expenses are 
eliminated on consolidation.
A change in the ownership interest of a subsidiary, without a loss  
of control, is accounted for as an equity transaction.
If the Group loses control over a subsidiary, it derecognises the related assets 
(including goodwill), liabilities, non-controlling interest and other components 
of equity while any resultant gain or loss is recognised in the consolidated 
income statement. Any investment retained is recognised at fair value.
Business combinations and goodwill
Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method. 
The cost of an acquisition is measured as the aggregate of the 
consideration transferred, which is measured at acquisition date fair  
value, and the amount of any non-controlling interests in the acquiree.  
For each business combination, the Group elects whether to measure the 
non-controlling interests in the acquiree at fair value or at the proportionate 
share of the acquiree’s identifiable net assets. All transaction costs 
associated with business combinations are charged to the consolidated 
income statement in the reporting period of such combination.
When the Group acquires a business, it assesses the financial assets and 
liabilities assumed for appropriate classification and designation in 
accordance with the contractual terms, economic circumstances and 
pertinent conditions as at the acquisition date. This includes the 
separation of embedded derivatives in host contracts by the acquiree.  
If the business combination is achieved in stages, any previously held 
equity interest is re-measured at its acquisition date fair value and any 
resulting gain or loss is recognised in the consolidated income statement.
Goodwill is initially measured at cost, being the excess of the aggregate  
of the consideration transferred and the amount recognised for non-
controlling interests, and any previous interest held, over the net fair value 
of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed. If the fair value  
of the net assets acquired is in excess of the aggregate consideration 
transferred, the Group reassesses whether it has correctly identified all  
of the assets acquired and all of the liabilities assumed and reviews the 
procedures used to measure the amounts to be recognised at the 
acquisition date. If the reassessment still results in an excess of the fair 
value of net assets acquired over the aggregate consideration transferred, 
then the gain from a bargain purchase is recognised in the consolidated 
income statement. 
Following initial recognition, goodwill is measured at cost less any 
accumulated impairment losses. Goodwill is reviewed for impairment 
annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate 
that such carrying amount may be impaired. 
For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to the 
cash-generating units that are expected to benefit from the synergies  
of the combination. Each unit or units to which goodwill is allocated 
represents the lowest level within the Group at which the goodwill is 
monitored for internal management purposes and is not larger than  
an operating segment determined in accordance with IFRS 8  
‘Operating Segments’.
Impairment is determined by assessing the recoverable amount of the 
cash-generating units to which the goodwill relates. Where the recoverable 
amount of the cash-generating units is less than the carrying amount  
of the cash-generating units and related goodwill, an impairment loss  
is recognised.
Where goodwill has been allocated to cash-generating units and part of 
the operation within those units is disposed of, the goodwill associated 
with the operation disposed of is included in the carrying amount of the 
operation when determining the gain or loss on disposal of the operation. 
Goodwill disposed of in this circumstance is measured based on the 
relative values of the operation disposed of and the value portion of the 
cash-generating units retained.
Contingent consideration payable on a business combination 
When, as part of a business combination, the Group defers a proportion 
of the total purchase consideration payable for an acquisition, the amount 
provided for is the acquisition date fair value of the consideration. The 
unwinding of the discount element is recognised as a finance cost in  
the consolidated income statement. Changes in estimated contingent 
consideration payable on acquisition are recognised in the consolidated 
income statement unless they are measurement period adjustments 
which arise as a result of additional information obtained after the 
acquisition date about the facts and circumstances existing at the 
acquisition date, which are adjusted against carried goodwill. Contingent 
consideration that is classified as equity is not re-measured and 
subsequent settlement is accounted for within equity.
Investment in associates and joint ventures
An associate is an entity over which the Group has significant influence. 
Significant influence is the power to participate in the financial and 
operating policy decisions of the investee, but is not control or joint control 
over those policies.
Joint control is the contractually agreed sharing of control of an 
arrangement, which exists only when decisions about the relevant 
activities require unanimous consent of the parties sharing control. Joint 
arrangements are of two types: joint venture and joint operation. A joint 
venture is a type of joint arrangement whereby the parties that have joint 
control of the arrangement have rights to the net assets of the joint 
venture. A joint operation is a type of joint arrangement whereby the 
parties that have joint control of the arrangement have rights to the assets 
and obligations for the liabilities relating to the arrangement. 
Petrofac Annual report and accounts 2017 / 123
Financial statements 2 Summary of significant accounting policies 
continued
The considerations made in determining significant influence or  
joint control are similar to those necessary to determine control  
over subsidiaries.
The Group’s investments in its associates and joint ventures are 
accounted for using the equity method. Under the equity method, the 
investment in an associate or a joint venture is initially recognised at cost. 
The carrying amount of the investment is adjusted to recognise changes  
in the Group’s share of net assets of the associate or joint venture since 
the acquisition date. Goodwill relating to the associate or joint venture is 
included in the carrying amount of the investment and is not tested for 
impairment separately.
The consolidated income statement reflects the Group’s share of the 
profits of the associate or joint venture. Any change in OCI of those 
investees is presented as part of the Group’s consolidated statement of 
other comprehensive income. In addition, when there has been a change 
recognised directly in the equity of the associate or joint venture, the 
Group recognises its share of any changes, when applicable, in the 
consolidated statement of changes in equity. 
The Group’s share of profit or loss of an associates and joint ventures  
is presented separately in the consolidated income statement  
outside operating profit and represents profit or loss after tax and 
non-controlling interests.
Any unrealised gains and losses resulting from transactions between the 
Group and the associates and joint ventures are eliminated to the extent  
of the Group’s ownership interest in these associates and joint ventures.
The financial statements of the associates and joint ventures are prepared 
for the same reporting period as the Group. When necessary, adjustments 
are made to align the accounting policies with those of the Group.
After application of the equity method, the Group determines whether  
it is necessary to recognise an impairment loss on its investment in its 
associate or joint venture. At end of each reporting period, the Group 
determines whether there is objective evidence that its investment in the 
associates or joint ventures is impaired. If there is such evidence, the 
Group calculates the amount of impairment as the difference between  
the recoverable amount of the associate or joint venture and its carrying 
amount and recognises any loss as an exceptional item in the 
consolidated income statement.
Upon loss of significant influence over an associate or joint control over a 
joint venture, the Group measures and recognises any retained investment 
at its fair value. Any difference between the carrying amount of the 
associate or joint venture upon loss of significant influence or joint control 
and the fair value of the retained investment and proceeds from disposal  
is recognised in the consolidated income statement.
Joint operations
The Group’s interests in joint operations are recognised in relation to  
its interest in a joint operation’s: 
• Assets, including its share of any assets held jointly
• Liabilities, including its share of any liabilities incurred jointly
• Revenue from the sale of its share of the output arising from the  
joint operation
• Share of the revenue from the sale of the output by the joint operation
• Expenses, including its share of any expenses incurred jointly
Under joint operations, the expenses that the Group incurs and its share 
of the revenue earned are recognised in the consolidated income 
statement. Assets controlled and liabilities incurred by the Group are 
recognised in the consolidated statement of financial position.
Foreign currency translation
The Group’s consolidated financial statements are presented in United 
States dollars, which is also the Parent Company’s functional currency. 
Each entity in the Group determines its own functional currency and items 
included in the financial statements of each entity are measured using that 
functional currency. Functional currency is defined as the currency of the 
primary economic environment in which the entity operates. The Group 
uses the direct method of consolidation and on disposal of a foreign 
operation, the gain or loss that is reclassified to profit or loss reflects the 
amount that arises from using this method.
Transactions and balances
Transactions in foreign currencies are initially recorded by the Group’s 
entities at their respective functional currency spot rates at the date the 
transaction first qualifies for recognition. 
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are 
translated at the functional currency spot rates of exchange at the 
reporting date.
Differences arising on settlement or translation of monetary items are 
recognised in profit or loss with the exception of monetary items that  
are designated as part of the hedge of the Group’s net investment of a 
foreign operation. These are recognised in the consolidated statement  
of other comprehensive income until the net investment is disposed of,  
at which time the cumulative amount is reclassified to profit or loss.  
Tax charges and credits attributable to exchange differences on those 
monetary items are also recorded in the consolidated statement of other 
comprehensive income.
Non-monetary items that are measured at historical cost in a foreign 
currency are translated using the exchange rates at the dates of the initial 
transactions. Non-monetary items measured at fair value in a foreign 
currency are translated using the exchange rates at the date when the  
fair value is determined. The gain or loss arising on translation of 
non-monetary items measured at fair value is treated in line with the 
recognition of the gain or loss on the change in fair value of the item  
(i.e. translation differences on items whose fair value gain or loss is 
recognised in the consolidated statement of other comprehensive income 
or profit or loss are also recognised in the consolidated statement of other 
comprehensive income or profit or loss, respectively).
Group companies
On consolidation, the assets and liabilities of foreign operations are 
translated into United States dollars at the rate of exchange prevailing at 
the reporting date and their statements of profit or loss are translated at 
exchange rates prevailing at the transaction dates. The exchange 
differences arising on translation for consolidation are recognised in the 
consolidated statement of other comprehensive income. On disposal of a 
foreign operation, the component of the consolidated statement of other 
comprehensive income relating to that particular foreign operation is 
recognised in the consolidated income statement.
Any goodwill arising on the acquisition of a foreign operation and any fair 
value adjustments to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities arising 
on the acquisition are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign 
operation and translated at the spot rate of exchange at the reporting date.

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2017
CONTINUED Significant accounting judgements and estimates
Judgements
In the process of applying the Group’s accounting policies, management 
has made the following judgements, apart from those involving 
estimations, which have the most significant effect on the amounts 
recognised in the consolidated financial statements: 
• Revenue recognition on lump-sum engineering, procurement and 
construction project execution services contracts: the Group 
recognises revenue on fixed-price engineering, procurement and 
construction contracts using the percentage-of-completion method, 
based on client certified surveys of work performed – this is an output 
method of measuring progress and recognising revenue. The Group 
has determined this basis of revenue recognition is the best available 
measure of progress on such contracts
• Revenue recognition on consortium contracts: the Group recognises 
its share of revenue from contracts agreed as part of a consortium. 
The Group uses the percentage-of-completion method based on 
client certified surveys of work performed to recognise revenue for the 
period and recognises its share of revenue and costs in accordance 
with the agreed consortium contractual arrangement. In selecting the 
appropriate accounting treatment, the main considerations are:
 – Determination of whether the joint arrangement is a joint operation 
or joint venture (though not directly related to revenue recognition 
this element has a material impact on the presentation of revenue 
or share of profit/loss of the joint venture, in the consolidated 
income statement)
 – At what point can the revenues, costs and margin from service 
contract be reliably measured in accordance with IAS 11 
‘Construction Contracts’, and
 – Whether there are any other remaining features unique to the 
contract that are relevant to the assessment
In selecting the most relevant and reliable accounting policies for Integrated 
Energy Services (IES) contracts, the main considerations are as follows:
• Determination of whether the joint arrangement is a joint operation or 
joint venture (though not directly related to revenue recognition this 
element has a material impact on the presentation of revenue or share 
of profit/loss of the joint venture, in the consolidated income statement)
• Whether the Group has legal rights to the production output and 
therefore is able to book reserves in respect of the project
• The nature and extent, if any, of volume and price financial exposures 
under the terms of the contract
• The extent to which the Group’s capital investment is at risk and the 
mechanism for recoverability under the terms of the contract
• At what point can the revenues from each type of contract be reliably 
measured in accordance with IAS 18 ‘Revenue’
• Whether there are any other remaining features unique to the contract 
that are relevant to the assessment
Revenue recognition of IES contracts:
• The Group assesses on a case by case basis the most appropriate 
treatment for its various commercial structures which include Risk 
Service Contracts (RSCs), Production Enhancement Contracts (PECs) 
and Equity Upstream Investments including Production Sharing 
Contracts (PSCs) (see accounting policies note on page 127  
for further details)
IES contracts are classified in the consolidated statement of financial 
position as follows:
• The Group assesses on a case by case basis the most appropriate 
consolidated statement of financial position classification of its 
Production Enhancement Contracts and Equity Upstream Investments 
(see accounting policy notes on page 127)
• In selecting the most appropriate policies for IES contracts the main 
judgements are as follows:
 – The Greater Stella Area (GSA) asset was treated in the consolidated 
statement of financial position as a financial asset and measured at 
fair value through profit and loss (FVTPL) until it was converted to a 
20% ownership interest in the GSA field. On 21 September 2017 , 
the Group obtained Oil and Gas Authority approval in the UK and 
the financial asset was converted to a 20% equity share in the GSA 
licence and is now accounted for as a Production Sharing Contract 
(PSC) type arrangement (note 10). The acquisition of 20% 
ownership interest in the GSA field was treated as a joint operation 
since contractually all the decisions concerning the relevant 
activities of the unincorporated joint arrangement require 
unanimous consent of the joint arrangement partners
 – The Mexican PEC assets are classified as oil and gas assets within 
property, plant and equipment in the consolidated statement  
of financial position as there is direct exposure to variable field 
production levels, and indirect exposure to changes in oil and  
gas prices. These exposures impact the generation of cash from 
the assets and any financial return thereon, including the risk of 
negative financial return. We believe this classification is most 
appropriate due to the nature of expenditure and it is aligned  
with our treatment in respect of PSC arrangements where the  
risk/reward profile is similar
 – Upon migration to PSC arrangements, the existing net assets of the 
PEC assets will be derecognised and an oil and gas asset within 
property, plant and equipment, representing the Group’s ownership 
interest in the PSC, will be recognised. Any gain or loss arising  
on the migration will be recognised as an exceptional item in the 
consolidated income statement. During 2017 , the Group migrated 
the Santuario PEC in Mexico to a PSC (note 10) and recognised a 
loss of US$20m on migration (note 5). The migrated PSC 
arrangements will be treated as a joint operation since contractually 
all the decisions concerning the relevant activities of the 
unincorporated joint arrangement will require unanimous consent of 
the joint arrangement partners
 – JSD6000 installation vessel (the ‘vessel’) had a pre-impairment 
carrying amount of US$393m at 31 December 2017 , and was 
reclassified from assets under construction within property, plant 
and equipment to assets held for sale, since the vessel’s carrying 
amount is expected to be recovered principally through a disposal 
transaction rather than through its intended use. Based on 
discussions with potential counterparties, Management has 
determined that the recoverable amount of the vessel (fair value 
less costs of disposal) was lower than its carrying amount and as a 
result has recognised an impairment charge of US$176m as an 
exceptional item (note 5) in the consolidated income statement. The 
vessel is available for immediate sale in its present condition and 
location. The disposal is expected to be completed within 
12 months from the end of the reporting period and relates  
to the Engineering & Construction reporting segment
Estimation uncertainty
The key assumptions concerning the future and other key sources of 
estimation uncertainty at the end of the reporting period that have a 
significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts  
of assets and liabilities within the next financial year are discussed below:
• Liquidated damages claims (LDs): the Group provides for LD claims 
where the customer has the contractual right to apply LDs and it is 
considered probable that the customer will successfully pursue such a 
claim. This requires an estimate of the amount of LDs payable under a 
claim which involves a number of management judgements and 
assumptions regarding the amounts to recognise in contract 
accounting. US$4m was provided during the year for LD claims 
(2016: US$153m)
Petrofac Annual report and accounts 2017 / 125
Financial statements 2 Summary of significant accounting policies 
continued
• Project costs to complete estimates: at the end of the reporting period 
the Group is required to estimate costs to complete on fixed-price 
contracts. Estimating costs to complete on such contracts requires the 
Group to make estimates of future costs to be incurred, based on work 
to be performed beyond the reporting period. This estimate will impact 
revenues, cost of sales, work-in-progress, billings in excess of costs 
and estimated earnings and accrued contract expenses
• Recognition of variation orders (VOs): the Group recognises revenues 
and margins from VOs where it is considered probable that the VOs 
will be settled by the customer and this requires management to 
assess the likelihood of such a settlement being made by reference to 
the contract, customer communications and other forms of 
documentary evidence. At 31 December 2017 , the work in progress 
line item in the consolidated statement of financial position includes 
variation orders of US$374m (2016: US$525m) 
• Onerous contract provisions: the Group provides for future losses on 
contracts where it is considered probable that contract costs are likely 
to exceed revenues in future years. Estimating these future losses 
involves a number of assumptions about the achievement of contract 
performance targets and the likely levels of future cost escalation over 
time. The carrying amount of onerous contract provisions at 31 
December 2017 was US$16m (2016: US$29m). See note 28
• Onerous operating lease provision: the Group provides for future costs 
on its non-cancellable operating leases where it is considered 
probable that the leasehold office buildings will remain vacant in future 
years due to reduced business activity. Assumptions involve an 
estimate of future business growth and the likely levels of occupancy 
over time. The carrying amount of onerous operating lease provision at 
31 December 2017 was US$18m (2016: US$11m). See note 28
• Impairment of goodwill: the Group determines whether goodwill is 
impaired at least on an annual basis. This requires an estimation of the 
value in use of the cash-generating units to which the goodwill is 
allocated. Estimating the value in use requires the Group to make an 
estimate of the expected future cash flows from each cash-generating 
unit and also to determine a suitable discount rate in order to calculate 
the present value of those cash flows. The carrying amount of goodwill 
at 31 December 2017 was US$76m (2016: US$72m). See note 13
• Deferred tax assets: the Group recognises deferred tax assets on all 
applicable temporary differences where it is probable that the tax 
assets estimated are realised and future taxable profits will be available 
for utilisation. This requires management to make judgements and 
assumptions regarding the interpretation of tax laws and regulations as 
they apply to events in the period and the amount of deferred tax that 
can be recognised based on the magnitude and likelihood of future 
taxable profits which are estimated from management assumptions 
with respect to the outcome of future events. The carrying amount of 
net deferred tax assets at 31 December 2017 was US$101m (2016: 
US$63m). Included within the gross assets is US$33m (2016: US$nil) 
on which a management judgement has been made on the probable 
treatment of the Migration of Santuario Production Enhancement 
Contract (PEC) to Production Sharing Contract (PSC) for tax purposes, 
based on professional external advice
• Income tax: Group entities are routinely subject to tax audits and 
assessments including processes whereby tax return filings are 
discussed and agreed with the relevant tax authorities. Whilst the 
ultimate outcome of such tax audits and discussions cannot be 
determined with certainty, management estimates the level of tax 
provisioning required for amounts where there is a probable future 
outflow, based on the applicable law and regulations, historic 
outcomes of similar audits and discussions, professional external 
advice and consideration of the progress on, and nature of, current 
discussions with the tax authority concerned. The ultimate outcome 
following resolution of such audits and assessments may be materially 
higher or lower than the amount provided. The carrying amount of tax 
provisions at 31 December 2017 was US$93m (2016: US$73m)
• Other taxes payable: the Group accrues indirect taxes, such as value 
added tax, to the extent it is probable that there will be an associated tax 
payment or receipt in respect of relevant income and expenses. This 
requires management to make judgements and assumptions on the 
application of tax laws and regulations to events in the period. The ultimate 
outcome may result in materially higher or lower payments or receipts 
• Recoverable amount of property, plant and equipment, intangible 
assets and other financial assets: the Group determines at the end of 
the reporting period whether there are indicators of impairment in the 
carrying amount of its property, plant and equipment, intangible assets 
and other financial assets. Where indicators exist, an impairment test is 
undertaken which requires management to estimate the recoverable 
amount of its assets which is initially based on its value in use. When 
necessary, fair value less costs of disposal is estimated, for example, 
by reference to quoted market values, similar arm’s length transactions 
involving these assets or risk adjusted discounted cash flow models. 
For the following specific assets, certain assumptions and estimates 
have been made in determining recoverable amounts. Should any 
changes occur in these assumptions, further impairment may be 
required in future periods:
 – Impairment testing performed for the Mexican PEC assets and fair 
value re-measurement of the Panuco contingent consideration 
which have a combined carrying amount of US$412m at 31 
December 2017 (2016: US$676m); the recoverable amount is 
influenced by the outcome of ongoing contractual negotiations in 
respect of the outstanding PEC migration to equity type 
arrangements. Key assumptions include the expected working 
interest in the PSC and financial and fiscal terms achieved upon 
migration. During 2017 , the Group successfully migrated the 
Santuario PEC to a PSC type arrangement and has used similar 
assumptions to determine the recoverable amounts for other  
PEC assets. An estimate was also undertaken in respect of the 
deferred consideration amount receivable, arising from the disposal 
of Pánuco PEC, when determining the recoverable amount for this 
asset, with key assumptions relating to the terms under which other 
assets will be migrated to a PSC type arrangement. There is 
currently political uncertainty in Mexico in the lead up to the general 
election in July 2018 which may delay migration negotiations or, 
ultimately, have a negative impact on the contractual terms and 
conditions anticipated in the migrations. This would result in a loss 
on migration through lower fair value re-measurements of the net 
assets being contributed into the equity interest
 – Block PM304 oil and gas asset in Malaysia had a carrying amount 
of US$244m (2016: US$286m); the recoverable amount was 
determined with reference to the expected terms under which the 
current contract will be re-negotiated and extended with the 
concession holder
In 2017 there were pre-tax impairment charges and fair value re-
measurements of US$422m (2016: US$260m) post-tax US$367m (2016: 
US$257m) which are explained in note 5. The key sources of estimation 
uncertainty for these measurements are consistent with those disclosed in 
note 5:
• Units of production depreciation: estimated proven plus probable 
reserves are used in determining the depreciation of oil and gas assets 
such that the depreciation charge is proportional to the depletion of the 
remaining reserves over the shorter of: life of the field or the end of the 
respective licence/concession period. These calculations require the 
use of estimates including the amount of economically recoverable 
reserves and future oil and gas capital expenditure (note 11)
• Decommissioning costs: the recognition and measurement of 
decommissioning provisions involves the use of estimates and 
assumptions which include the existence of an obligation to dismantle 
and remove a facility or restore the site on which it is located, the 
126 / Petrofac Annual report and accounts 2017
NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2017
CONTINUED appropriate discount and inflation rates to use in determining the net 
present value of the liability, the estimated costs of decommissioning 
based on internal and external estimates and the payment dates for 
expected decommissioning costs. As a result, actual costs could differ 
from estimated cost estimates used to provide for decommissioning 
obligations. The provision for decommissioning at 31 December 2017 
of US$138m (2016: US$116m) represents management’s best 
estimate of the present value of future decommissioning costs
Revenue recognition
Revenue is recognised to the extent that it is probable economic  
benefits will flow to the Group and the revenue can be reliably measured. 
The following specific recognition criteria also apply:
Engineering & Construction (E&C) revenues from fixed-price lump-sum 
contracts are recognised using the percentage-of-completion method, 
based on client certified surveys of work performed once the outcome of 
a contract can be estimated reliably. In the early stages of contract 
completion, when the outcome of a contract cannot be estimated reliably, 
contract revenues are recognised only to the extent of costs incurred that 
are expected to be recoverable.
Revenues from cost-plus-fee contracts are recognised on the basis of 
costs incurred during the year plus the fee earned measured by the 
cost-to-cost method.
Revenues from reimbursable contracts are recognised in the period in 
which the services are provided based on the agreed contract schedule  
of rates.
Provision is made for all losses expected to arise on completion of 
contracts entered into at the reporting date, whether or not work has 
commenced on these contracts.
Incentive payments are included in revenue when the contract is 
sufficiently advanced that it is probable that the specified performance 
standards will be met or exceeded and the amount of the incentive 
payments can be measured reliably. Variation orders are only included in 
revenue when it is probable they will be accepted and can be measured 
reliably and claims are only included in revenue when negotiations have 
reached an advanced stage such that it is probable that the claim will be 
accepted and can be measured reliably.
Engineering & Production Services (EPS)
Revenues from reimbursable contracts are recognised in the period in 
which the services are provided based on the agreed contract schedule  
of rates.
Revenues from fixed-price contracts are recognised on the percentage-
of-completion method, measured by milestones completed or earned 
value once the outcome of a contract can be estimated reliably. In the 
early stages of contract completion, when the outcome of a contract 
cannot be estimated reliably, contract revenues are recognised only to  
the extent of costs incurred that are expected to be recoverable.
Incentive payments are included in revenue when the contract is 
sufficiently advanced that it is probable that the specified performance 
standards will be met or exceeded and the amount of the incentive 
payments can be measured reliably. Claims are only included in revenue 
when negotiations have reached an advanced stage such that it is 
probable the claim will be accepted and can be measured reliably.
Integrated Energy Services (IES)
Production Enhancement Contracts (PEC)
Revenue from PECs is recognised based on the volume of hydrocarbons 
produced in the period and the agreed tariff and the reimbursement 
arrangement for costs incurred.
Equity Upstream Investments
Oil and gas revenues comprise the Group’s share of sales from the 
processing or sale of hydrocarbons from the Group’s Equity Upstream 
Investments on an entitlement basis, when the significant risks and 
rewards of ownership have been passed to the buyer.
Borrowing costs
Borrowing costs directly attributable to the construction of qualifying 
assets, which are assets that necessarily take a substantial period of time 
to prepare for their intended use, are added to the cost of those assets, 
until such time as the assets are substantially ready for their intended use. 
All other borrowing costs are recognised as interest payable within the 
finance costs line item in the consolidated income statement in the period 
in which they are incurred.
Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment is measured at cost less accumulated 
depreciation and accumulated impairment charges. Cost comprises the 
purchase price or construction cost and any costs directly attributable  
to making that asset capable of operating as intended. The purchase  
price or construction cost is the aggregate amount paid and the fair value 
of any other consideration given to acquire the asset. Depreciation is 
provided on a straight-line basis, other than on oil and gas assets, at the 
following rates:
Oil and gas facilities 10% – 12.5%
Plant and equipment 4% – 33%
Buildings and leasehold improvements 5% – 33% 
 (or lease term if shorter)
Office furniture and equipment 25% – 50%
Vehicles  20% – 33%
Tangible oil and gas assets are depreciated, on a field-by-field basis,  
using the unit-of-production method based on entitlement to proven  
and probable reserves, taking account of estimated future development 
expenditure relating to those reserves; refer to page 41 for life of  
these fields.
Each asset’s estimated useful life, residual value and method of 
depreciation are reviewed and adjusted if appropriate at the end  
of the reporting period.
No depreciation is charged on land or assets under construction.
The carrying amount of an item of property, plant and equipment is 
derecognised on disposal or when no future economic benefits are 
expected from its use or disposal. The gain or loss arising from the 
derecognition of an item of property, plant and equipment is included in 
the other operating income line item in the consolidated income statement 
when the asset is derecognised. Gains are not classified as revenue.
Intangible assets – non oil and gas assets
Intangible assets acquired in a business combination are initially measured 
at cost being their fair values at the date of acquisition and are recognised 
separately from goodwill where the asset is separable or arises from a 
contractual or other legal right and its fair value can be measured reliably. 
After initial recognition, intangible assets are carried at cost less 
accumulated amortisation and any accumulated impairment charges. 
Intangible assets with a finite life are amortised over their useful economic 
life using a straight-line method unless a better method reflecting the 
pattern in which the asset’s future economic benefits are expected to be 
consumed can be determined. The amortisation charge in respect of 
intangible assets is included in the selling, general and administration 
expenses line of the consolidated income statement. The expected useful 
lives of assets are reviewed on an annual basis. Any change in the useful 
life or pattern of consumption of the intangible asset is treated as a change 
in accounting estimate and is accounted for prospectively by changing the 
amortisation period or method. Intangible assets are tested for impairment 
whenever there is an indication that the asset may be impaired.
Petrofac Annual report and accounts 2017 / 127
Financial statements 2 Summary of significant accounting policies 
continued
Oil and gas assets
Capitalised costs
The Group’s activities in relation to oil and gas assets are limited to assets 
in the evaluation, development and production phases.
Oil and gas evaluation and development expenditure is accounted for 
using the successful efforts method of accounting.
Evaluation expenditures
Expenditure directly associated with evaluation (or appraisal) activities  
is capitalised as an intangible oil and gas asset. Such costs include the 
costs of acquiring an interest, appraisal well drilling costs, payments to 
contractors and an appropriate share of directly attributable overheads 
incurred during the evaluation phase. For such appraisal activity, which 
may require drilling of further wells, costs continue to be recognised as an 
asset whilst related hydrocarbons are considered capable of commercial 
development. Such costs are subject to technical, commercial and 
management review to confirm the continued intent to develop, or 
otherwise extract value. When this is no longer the case, the costs are 
written-off in the consolidated income statement. When such assets are 
declared part of a commercial development, related costs are transferred 
to tangible oil and gas assets. All intangible oil and gas assets are 
assessed for any impairment prior to transfer and any impairment charge  
is recognised in the consolidated income statement.
Development expenditures
Expenditures relating to development of assets which includes the 
construction, installation and completion of infrastructure facilities such as 
platforms, pipelines and vessels are capitalised within property, plant and 
equipment as oil and gas facilities. Expenditures relating to the drilling and 
completion of production wells are capitalised within property, plant and 
equipment as oil and gas assets.
Changes in unit-of-production factors
Changes in factors which affect unit-of-production calculations are dealt 
with prospectively in accordance with the treatment of changes in 
accounting estimates, not by immediate adjustment of amounts 
recognised in prior reporting periods.
Decommissioning
Provision for future decommissioning costs is made in full when the Group 
has an obligation to dismantle and remove a facility or an item of plant and 
to restore the site on which it is located, and when a reasonable estimate 
of that liability can be made. The amount recognised is the present value 
of the estimated future decommissioning costs. An amount equivalent to 
the discounted initial provision for decommissioning costs is capitalised 
and amortised over the life of the underlying asset on a unit-of-production 
basis over proven and probable reserves. Any change in the present value 
of the estimated decommissioning costs is reflected as an adjustment to 
the provision and the oil and gas asset.
The unwinding of the discount applied to future decommissioning provisions 
is included in the finance costs line in the consolidated income statement.
Impairment of assets (excluding goodwill)
At each reporting date, the Group reviews the carrying amounts of its 
property, plant and equipment and intangible assets to assess whether 
there is an indication that those assets may be impaired. If any such 
indication exists, the Group makes an estimate of the asset’s recoverable 
amount. An asset’s recoverable amount is the higher of its fair value less 
costs of disposal and its value in use. In assessing value in use, the 
estimated future cash flows attributable to the asset are discounted to 
their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current 
market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to 
the asset. Fair value less costs of disposal is based on the risk-adjusted 
discounted cash flow models and includes value attributable to contingent 
resources. A post-tax discount rate is used in such calculations. 
If the recoverable amount of an asset is estimated to be less than its 
carrying amount, the carrying amount of the asset is reduced to its 
recoverable amount. An impairment charge is recognised immediately in 
the consolidated income statement, unless the relevant asset is carried at 
a revalued amount, in which case the impairment loss is treated as a 
revaluation decrease.
Where an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of 
the asset is increased to the revised estimate of its recoverable amount, but 
so that the increased carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount 
that would have been determined had no impairment loss been recognised 
for the asset in prior reporting periods. A reversal of an impairment loss is 
recognised immediately in the consolidated income statement, unless the 
relevant asset is carried at a revalued amount, in which case the reversal of 
the impairment is treated as a revaluation increase.
Non-current assets held for sale
Non-current assets or disposal groups are classified as held for sale when 
it is highly probable that the carrying amount of the asset will be recovered 
principally through a sale transaction rather than through continuing use 
and the non-current assets or disposal group are available for immediate 
sale in their present condition. Assets are not depreciated when classified  
as held for sale.
Inventories
Inventories are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value.  
Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course  
of business, less estimated costs of completion and the estimated costs 
necessary to make the sale. Cost comprises purchase price, cost of 
production, transportation and other directly allocable expenses.  
Costs of inventories, other than raw materials, are determined using  
the first-in-first-out method. Costs of raw materials are determined  
using the weighted average method.
Work in progress and billings in excess of cost  
and estimated earnings
Fixed-price lump-sum engineering, procurement and construction 
contracts are presented in the consolidated statement of financial position 
as follows: 
• For each contract, the accumulated cost incurred, as well as the 
estimated earnings recognised at the contract’s percentage-of-
completion less provision for any anticipated losses, after deducting 
the progress payments received or receivable from the customers,  
is presented in the work in progress line item in the consolidated 
statement of financial position
• Where the payments received or receivable for any contract exceeds 
the cost and estimated earnings less provision for any anticipated 
losses, the excess is presented in the billings in excess of cost and 
estimated earnings line item in the consolidated statement of  
financial position
Pre-contract/bid costs
Pre-contract/bid costs incurred are recognised as an expense until  
there is a high probability that the contract will be awarded, after which  
all further costs are recognised as assets and expensed over the life of  
the contract.
Trade and other receivables
Trade receivables are recognised at original invoice amount less an 
allowance for any amounts estimated to be uncollectable. An estimate for 
doubtful debts is made when there is objective evidence that the collection 
of the full amount is no longer probable under the terms of the original 
invoice. Impaired debts are derecognised when they are assessed as 
uncollectable.
128 / Petrofac Annual report and accounts 2017
NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2017
CONTINUED Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents consist of cash at bank and in hand and 
short-term deposits with an original maturity of three months or less.  
For the purpose of the consolidated statement of cash flow, cash and 
cash equivalents consists of cash and cash equivalents as defined above, 
net of outstanding bank overdrafts.
Provisions
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present legal or 
constructive obligation as a result of past events, it is probable that an 
outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable 
estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation. If the time value of 
money is material, provisions are discounted using a pre-tax rate that 
reflects, where appropriate, the risks specific to the liability. Where 
discounting is used, the increase in the provision due to the passage of 
time is recognised in the consolidated income statement as a finance cost.
Fair value measurement
The Group measures financial instruments, such as derivatives, and the 
Pánuco deferred consideration at fair value at each reporting date. Fair 
value related disclosures for financial instruments are disclosed in note 18.
Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to 
transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants  
at the measurement date. The fair value measurement is based on the 
presumption that the transaction to sell the asset or transfer the liability 
takes place either: 
• In the principal market for the asset or liability, or
• In the absence of a principal market, in the most advantageous market 
for the asset or liability
The principal or the most advantageous market must be accessible  
by the Group.
The fair value of an asset or a liability is measured using the assumptions 
that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability, 
assuming that market participants act in their economic best interest.
A fair value measurement of a non-financial asset takes into account 
a market participant’s ability to generate economic benefits by using 
the asset in its highest and best use or by selling it to another market 
participant that would use the asset in its highest and best use.
The Group uses valuation techniques that are appropriate in the 
circumstances and for which sufficient data is available to measure fair 
value, maximising the use of relevant observable inputs and minimising  
the use of unobservable inputs.
All assets and liabilities for which fair value is measured or disclosed in  
the financial statements are categorised within the fair value hierarchy, 
described as follows, based on the lowest level input that is significant  
to the fair value measurement as a whole:
• Level 1 – Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical 
financial assets or liabilities
• Level 2 – Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that 
are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices)  
or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices)
• Level 3 – Inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on 
observable market data (unobservable inputs)
For assets and liabilities that are recognised in the consolidated financial 
statements on a recurring basis, the Group determines whether transfers 
have occurred between levels in the hierarchy by re-assessing 
categorisation (based on the lowest level input that is significant to the  
fair value measurement as a whole) at the end of each reporting period.
For the purpose of fair value disclosures, the Group has determined classes 
of assets and liabilities on the basis of the nature, characteristics and risks of 
the asset or liability and the level of the fair value hierarchy as explained above. 
Financial assets
Initial recognition and measurement
Financial assets are classified, at initial recognition, as financial assets at 
fair value through profit or loss, loans and receivables, held-to-maturity 
investments, or as derivatives designated as hedging instruments in an 
effective hedge, as appropriate. All financial assets are recognised initially 
at fair value plus, in the case of financial assets not recorded at fair value 
through profit or loss, transaction costs that are attributable to the 
acquisition of the financial asset.
Subsequent measurement
For purposes of subsequent measurement financial assets are classified 
in the following categories:
• Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss
• Loans and receivables
Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss
Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss include financial assets 
held for trading and financial assets designated upon initial recognition  
at fair value through profit or loss. Financial assets are classified as held  
for trading if they are acquired for the purpose of selling or repurchasing  
in the near term. Derivatives, including separated embedded derivatives, 
are also classified as held for trading unless they are designated as 
effective hedging instruments as defined by IAS 39 ‘Financial Instruments 
– Recognition and Measurement’. Financial assets at fair value through 
profit or loss are carried in the consolidated statement of financial position 
at fair value with net changes in fair value reported in the consolidated 
income statement.
The fair value changes to undesignated forward currency contracts are 
reported within the other operating income/expenses line item in the 
consolidated income statement. The fair value changes relating to the 
amounts receivable in respect of the development of the Greater Stella 
Area are recorded as an exceptional item in the consolidated income 
statement, see note 5. The unwinding of discount on the Pánuco deferred 
consideration is recognised as finance income in the consolidated income 
statement. No other fair value movements occurred during 2017 .
Loans and receivables
Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or 
determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market. After initial 
measurement, such financial assets are subsequently measured at 
amortised cost using the effective interest rate (EIR) method, less 
accumulated impairment charges. Amortised cost is calculated by taking 
into account any discount or premium on acquisition and fees or costs 
that are an integral part of the EIR. The EIR amortisation is included in 
finance income in the consolidated income statement. This category 
generally applies to trade and other receivables.
Financial liabilities
Initial recognition and measurement
Financial liabilities are classified, at initial recognition, as financial liabilities at fair 
value through profit or loss, loans and borrowings, payables, or as derivatives 
designated as hedging instruments in an effective hedge, as appropriate.
All financial liabilities are recognised initially at fair value and, in the case  
of loans and borrowings and trade and other payables, net of directly 
attributable transaction costs.
The Group’s financial liabilities include trade and other payables, loans  
and borrowings including bank overdrafts, financial guarantee contracts 
and derivative financial instruments.
Subsequent measurement
For purposes of subsequent measurement financial liabilities are classified 
in the following categories:
• Financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss
• Loans and borrowings
Petrofac Annual report and accounts 2017 / 129
Financial statements 2 Summary of significant accounting policies 
continued
Financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss
Financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss include financial 
liabilities held for trading and financial liabilities designated upon initial 
recognition as at fair value through profit or loss.
Financial liabilities are classified as held for trading if they are incurred for 
the purpose of repurchasing in the near term. This category also includes 
derivative financial instruments entered into by the Group that are not 
designated as hedging instruments in hedge relationships as defined by 
IAS 39 ‘Financial Instruments – Recognition and Measurement’. 
Separated embedded derivatives are also classified as held for trading 
unless they are designated as effective hedging instruments.
Gains or losses on liabilities held for trading are recognised in the 
consolidated income statement.
Financial liabilities designated upon initial recognition at fair value through 
profit or loss are designated at the initial date of recognition, and only if the 
criteria in IAS 39 are satisfied. The Group has not designated any financial 
liability as at fair value through profit or loss.
Loans and borrowings
This is the category most relevant to the Group. After initial recognition, 
interest-bearing loans and borrowings are subsequently measured at 
amortised cost using the EIR method. Gains and losses are recognised  
in the other operating income/expenses line item in the consolidated 
income statement when the liabilities are derecognised as well as through  
the EIR amortisation process.
Amortised cost is calculated by taking into account any discount or 
premium on acquisition and fees or costs that are an integral part of the 
EIR. The EIR amortisation is included as finance costs in the consolidated 
income statement.
This category generally applies to interest-bearing loans and borrowings. 
For more information, refer to note 27 .
Derecognition of financial assets and liabilities
Financial assets
A financial asset (or, where applicable, a part of a financial asset) is 
derecognised where:
• The rights to receive cash flows from the asset have expired
• The Group retains the right to receive cash flows from the asset,  
but has assumed an obligation to pay them in full without material 
delay to a third party under a ‘pass-through’ arrangement; or
• The Group has transferred its rights to receive cash flows from the 
asset and either (a) has transferred substantially all the risks and 
rewards of the asset, or (b) has neither transferred nor retained 
substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset, but has transferred 
control of the asset 
Financial liabilities
A financial liability is derecognised when the obligation under the liability  
is discharged or cancelled or expires.
If an existing financial liability is replaced by another from the same lender,  
on substantially different terms, or the terms of an existing liability are 
substantially modified, such an exchange or modification is treated as a 
derecognition of the original liability and the recognition of a new liability such 
that the difference in the respective carrying amounts together with any 
costs or fees incurred are recognised in the consolidated income statement.
Offsetting of financial instruments
Financial assets and financial liabilities are offset and the net amount is 
reported in the consolidated statement of financial position if there is a 
currently enforceable legal right to offset the recognised amounts and 
there is an intention to settle on a net basis, to realise the assets and  
settle the liabilities simultaneously.
Derivative financial instruments and hedging
The Group uses derivative financial instruments such as forward currency 
contracts and oil price collars and forward contracts to hedge its risks 
associated with foreign currency and oil price fluctuations. Such derivative 
financial instruments are initially recognised at fair value on the date  
on which a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently 
re-measured at fair value. Derivatives are carried as assets when the  
fair value is positive and as liabilities when the fair value is negative.
Any gains or losses arising from changes in the fair value of derivatives  
that do not qualify for hedge accounting are taken to the consolidated 
income statement.
The fair value of forward currency contracts is calculated by reference to 
current forward exchange rates for contracts with similar maturity profiles. 
The fair value of oil price collar contracts is determined by reference to 
market values for similar instruments.
For the purposes of hedge accounting, hedges are classified as:
• Fair value hedges when hedging the exposure to changes in the fair 
value of a recognised asset or liability; or
• Cash flow hedges when hedging exposure to variability in cash flows 
that is either attributable to a particular risk associated with a 
recognised asset or liability or a highly probable forecast transaction
The Group formally designates and documents the relationship between the 
hedging instrument and the hedged item at the inception of the transaction, 
as well as its risk management objectives and strategy for undertaking various 
hedge transactions. The documentation also includes identification of the 
hedging instrument, the hedged item or transaction, the nature of risk  
being hedged and how the Group will assess the hedging instrument’s 
effectiveness in offsetting the exposure to changes in the hedged item’s  
fair value or cash flows attributable to the hedged risk. The Group also 
documents its assessment, both at hedge inception and on an ongoing basis, 
of whether the derivatives that are used in the hedging transactions are highly 
effective in offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows of the hedged items.
The treatment of gains and losses arising from revaluing derivatives 
designated as hedging instruments depends on the nature of the hedging 
relationship, as follows:
Cash flow hedges
For cash flow hedges, the effective portion of the gain or loss on the 
hedging instrument is recognised directly in the consolidated statement  
of other comprehensive income in net unrealised gains/(losses) on 
derivatives, while the ineffective portion is recognised in the consolidated 
income statement. Amounts taken to other comprehensive income are 
transferred to the consolidated income statement when the hedged 
transaction affects the consolidated income statement. The material forward 
rate movements in the Kuwaiti dinar forward currency contracts are 
recorded as an exceptional item in the consolidated income statement.
If the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised 
without replacement or rollover, or if its designation as a hedge is revoked, 
any cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in other comprehensive 
income remains separately in equity until the forecast transaction occurs 
and affects the consolidated income statement. When a forecast 
transaction is no longer expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss that 
was reported in other comprehensive income is immediately transferred  
to the consolidated income statement.
Embedded derivatives
Contracts are assessed for the existence of embedded derivatives  
at the date that the Group first becomes party to the contract, with 
reassessment only if there is a change to the contract that significantly 
modifies the cash flows. Embedded derivatives which are not clearly and 
closely related to the underlying asset, liability or transaction are separated 
and accounted for as standalone derivatives.

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2017
CONTINUED Petrofac Employee Benefit Trusts
The Petrofac Employee Benefit Trust and the Petrofac Joint Venture 
Companies Employee Benefit Trust warehouse ordinary shares purchased 
to satisfy various new share scheme awards made to the employees of the 
Company and its joint venture partner employees, which will be transferred 
to the members of the schemes on their respective vesting dates subject to 
satisfying any performance conditions of each scheme. The trusts continue 
to be included in the Group financial statements under IFRS 10.
Treasury shares
For the purpose of making awards under the Group’s employee share 
schemes, shares in the Company are purchased and held by the Petrofac 
Employee Benefit Trust and the Petrofac Joint Venture Companies 
Employee Benefit Trust. All these shares have been classified in the 
statement of financial position as treasury shares within equity. Shares 
vested during the year are satisfied with these shares.
Share-based payment transactions
Employees (including Directors) of the Group receive remuneration in the 
form of share-based payment, whereby employees render services in 
exchange for shares or rights over shares (‘equity-settled transactions’).
Equity-settled transactions
The cost of equity-settled transactions with employees is measured  
by reference to the fair value at the date on which they are granted. 
The cost of equity-settled transactions is recognised in the selling, general  
and administration expenses line item in the consolidated income statement, 
together with a corresponding increase in other reserves in the consolidated 
statement of financial position, over the period in which the relevant 
employees become entitled to the award (the ‘vesting period’). The cumulative 
expense recognised for equity-settled transactions at the end of the reporting 
period until the vesting date reflects the extent to which the vesting period has 
expired and the Group’s best estimate of the number of equity instruments 
that will ultimately vest. The charge or credit to the consolidated income 
statement for a period represents the movement in cumulative expense 
recognised from the beginning to the end of the reporting period.
No expense is recognised for awards that do not ultimately vest because 
non-market performance and/or service conditions have not been met. 
Where awards include a market or non-vesting condition, the transactions 
are treated as vested irrespective of whether the market or non-vesting 
condition is satisfied, provided that all other performance and/or service 
conditions are satisfied.
Equity awards cancelled, e.g. in case of good leavers, are treated as 
vesting immediately on the date of cancellation, and any expense not 
recognised for the award at that date is recognised in the consolidated 
income statement.
Pensions and other long-term employment benefits
The Group has various defined contribution pension schemes in 
accordance with the local conditions and practices in the countries in 
which it operates. The amount charged to the consolidated income 
statement in respect of pension costs reflects the contributions payable in 
the year. Differences between contributions payable during the year and 
contributions actually paid are shown as either accrued liabilities or 
prepaid assets in the consolidated statement of financial position.
The Group’s other long-term employment benefits are provided in 
accordance with the labour laws of the countries in which the Group 
operates, further details of which are given in note 28.
Income taxes
Income tax expense represents the sum of current income tax and 
deferred tax.
Current income tax assets and liabilities for the current and prior periods 
are measured at the amount expected to be recovered from, or paid to the 
taxation authorities. Taxable profit differs from profit as reported in the 
consolidated income statement because it excludes items of income or 
expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further 
excludes items that are never taxable or deductible. The Group’s liability 
for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or 
substantively enacted by the statement of financial position date.
Deferred tax is recognised on all temporary differences at the statement  
of financial position date between the carrying amounts of assets and 
liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used 
in the computation of taxable profit, with the following exceptions: 
• Where the temporary difference arises from the initial recognition of 
goodwill or of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business 
combination that at the time of the transaction affects neither 
accounting nor taxable profit or loss
• In respect of taxable temporary differences associated with 
investments in subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures, where the 
timing of reversal of the temporary differences can be controlled and  
it is probable that the temporary differences will not reverse in the 
foreseeable future, and
• Deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is probable that 
a taxable profit will be available against which the deductible temporary 
differences and carried forward tax credits or tax losses can be utilised
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each statement 
of financial position date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer 
probable that sufficient taxable profit will be available to allow all or part  
of the deferred tax assets to be utilised. Unrecognised deferred tax  
assets are reassessed at each statement of financial position date and  
are recognised to the extent that it has become probable that future 
taxable profit will allow the deferred tax asset to be recovered.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured on an undiscounted basis 
at the tax rates that are expected to apply when the asset is realised or the 
liability is settled, based on tax rates and tax laws enacted or substantively 
enacted at the statement of financial position date.
Current and deferred tax is charged or credited directly to other 
comprehensive income or equity if it relates to items that are credited or 
charged to, respectively, other comprehensive income or equity. Otherwise, 
income tax is recognised in the consolidated income statement.
Leases
The determination of whether an arrangement is or contains a lease is 
based on the substance of the arrangement at inception date and whether 
the fulfilment of the arrangement is dependent on the use of a specific 
asset or assets or the arrangement conveys the right to use the asset.
Leases are classified as finance leases whenever the terms of the lease 
transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership to the lessee. 
All other leases are classified as operating leases.
Assets held under finance leases are recognised as non-current assets of 
the Group at the lower of their fair value at the date of commencement of the 
lease and the present value of the minimum lease payments. These assets 
are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the useful life of 
the asset and the lease term. The corresponding liability to the lessor is 
included in the consolidated statement of financial position as a finance 
lease obligation. Lease payments are apportioned between finance costs  
in the consolidated income statement and reduction of the lease obligation 
so as to achieve a constant rate of interest on the remaining balance of the 
liability. The Group has entered into various operating leases the payments 
for which are recognised as an expense in the consolidated income 
statement on a straight-line basis over the lease terms.

Financial statements 3 Segment information
The Group organisational structure comprises the following three reporting segments:
• Engineering & Construction (E&C), which provides lump-sum engineering, procurement and construction project execution services to the onshore 
and offshore oil and gas industry 
• Engineering & Production Services (EPS), which includes all reimbursable engineering and production services activities to the oil and gas industry
• Integrated Energy Services (IES), which is focused on delivering value from the existing asset portfolio 
Management separately monitors the trading results of its three reporting segments for the purpose of making an assessment of their performance and 
for making decisions about how resources are allocated. Interest costs and income arising from borrowings and cash balances which are not directly 
attributable to individual reporting segments are allocated to Corporate. In addition, certain shareholder services related overheads, intra-group 
financing and consolidation adjustments are managed at a corporate level and are not allocated to reporting segments.
The presentation of the Group results below also separately identifies the effect of the Laggan-Tormore loss, asset impairments, certain  
re-measurements, restructuring and redundancy costs, contract migration costs, material deferred tax movements arising due to foreign exchange 
differences in jurisdictions where tax is computed based on the functional currency of the country and material forward rate movements in Kuwaiti  
dinar forward currency contracts. Results excluding these exceptional items and certain re-measurements are used by management and presented  
in order to provide readers with a clear and consistent presentation of underlying business performance.
The following tables represent revenue and profit/(loss) information relating to the Group’s reporting segments for the year ended 31 December 2017 
and the comparative information for the year ended 31 December 2016.

Revenue from rendering of services includes Engineering & Production Services reporting segment revenues of a ‘pass-through’ nature with  
zero or low margins amounting to US$461m (2016: US$644m). The revenues are included as external revenues of the Group since the risks and 
rewards associated with recognition are assumed by the Group.
b. Cost of sales
Included in cost of sales is depreciation charged on property, plant and equipment of US$153m (2016: US$162m), intangible amortisation of  
US$1m (2016: US$1m) and an oil and gas intangible write off amounting to US$6m (2016: US$nil). 
Also included in cost of sales are forward points and ineffective portions on derivatives designated as cash flow hedges and losses on undesignated 
derivatives of US$5m (2016: US$1m). These amounts are an economic hedge of foreign exchange risk but do not meet the criteria within IAS 39 
‘Financial instruments – recognition and measurement’ and are most appropriately recognised in cost of sales.

Impairment of assets 
During the year, the Group reviewed the carrying amount of its Block PM304 oil and gas assets on a fair value basis using risk adjusted cash flow 
projections (Level 3 of the ‘fair value hierarchy’ contained within IFRS 13 ‘Fair value measurement’) discounted at a post-tax rate of 9.5% (2016: 9.5%) 
which resulted in a pre-tax impairment charge of US$54m (post-tax US$33m) in the Integrated Energy Services reporting segment (2016: pre-tax 
US$nil, post-tax US$nil). which was allocated proportionately to property, plant and equipment and intangible oil and gas assets. The oil price 
assumptions used by Management are the same as those disclosed in the ‘oil price assumptions’ section on page 137 . A 10% decrease in oil  
prices would result in an additional pre-tax impairment charge of US$87m (post-tax US$54m).
A further impairment charge of US$8m (post-tax US$8m) was also recognised in the Integrated Energy Services reporting segment on the FPSO 
Opportunity reflecting the recoverable amount of the vessel (2016: US$15m, post-tax US$15m). The FPSO Opportunity vessel was disposed during  
the year, and disposal proceeds of US$10m were realised against the carrying amount.
The JSD6000 installation vessel (the ‘vessel’) had a pre-impairment carrying amount of US$393m at 31 December 2017 , and was reclassified from 
assets under construction within property, plant and equipment to assets held for sale, since the vessel’s carrying amount is expected to be recovered 
principally through a disposal transaction rather than through its intended use. Based on discussions with potential counterparties, Management has 
determined that the recoverable amount of the vessel (fair value less costs of disposal) was lower than its carrying amount and as a result has 
recognised an impairment charge of US$176m (post-tax US$176m) as an exceptional item in the consolidated income statement. The vessel is available 
for immediate sale in its present condition and location. The disposal is expected to be completed within 12 months from the end of the reporting period 
and relates to the Engineering & Construction reporting segment (note 14).
On 18 December 2017 , the Group migrated its existing Santuario Production Enhancement Contract (PEC) to acquire a 36% ownership interest in the 
Production Sharing Contract (PSC). At the time of migration, the existing oil and gas assets of the Santuario PEC were fair valued and this resulted in  
an impairment charge of US$29m (post-tax US$20m) being recognised as an exceptional item in the consolidated income statement (note 10). The 
Group re-assessed the recoverable amount of the Santuario PSC oil and gas asset at 31 December 2017 , using risk adjusted cash flow projections 
(Level 3 of the ‘fair value hierarchy’ contained within IFRS 13 ‘Fair value measurement’) discounted at a post-tax rate of 9.5% and using the same oil 
price assumptions as those disclosed in the ‘oil price assumptions’ section on page 137 , and has concluded that no further impairment was required.  
A 10% decrease in oil prices would result in an additional pre-tax impairment charge of US$45m (post-tax US$31m).
At 31 December 2017 , the Group re-assessed the recoverable amount of the Greater Stella Area (GSA) oil and gas asset using risk adjusted cash flow 
projections (Level 3 of the ‘fair value hierarchy’ contained within IFRS 13 ‘Fair value measurement’) discounted at a post-tax rate of 9.5% and using the 
same oil price assumptions as those disclosed in the ‘oil price assumptions’ section on page 137 , and as a result recognised an impairment charge of 
US$77m (post-tax US$52m). A 10% decrease in oil prices would result in an additional pre-tax impairment charge of US$23m (post-tax US$23m).
During 2016, an impairment charge of US$197m (post-tax US$197m) was recognised as an exceptional item in the Integrated Energy Services reporting 
segment relating to the Seven Energy available-for-sale investment.
Fair value less costs of disposal is determined by discounting the post-tax cash flows expected to be generated from oil and gas production net of disposal 
costs taking into account assumptions that market participants would typically use in estimating fair values. Post-tax cash flows are derived from projected 
production profiles for each asset taking into account forward market commodity prices over the relevant period and, where external forward prices are  
not available, the Group’s Board-approved five-year business planning assumptions were used. As each field has different reservoir characteristics and

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2017
CONTINUED contractual terms the post-tax cash flows for each asset are calculated using individual economic models, which include assumptions around the amount  
of recoverable reserves, production costs, life of the field/licence period and the selling price of the commodities produced.
Oil price assumptions 
For determining the recoverable amount of property, plant and equipment and intangible oil and gas assets, Management has used forward curve oil prices of 
US$65 per barrel for 2018 and US$62 per barrel for 2019. For later periods, the long-term planning oil price assumptions used were US$65 per barrel for 2020, 
US$70 per barrel for 2021 and US$75 per barrel for 2022 and beyond (2016: forward curve oil prices of US$59 per barrel for 201 7 and US$58 per barrel for 
2018. For later periods, the long-term planning oil price assumptions used were US$70 per barrel for 2019, and US$75 per barrel for 2020 and beyond).
Fair value re-measurements on receivable in respect of the development of the Greater Stella Area (GSA)
On 21 September 2017 , upon receiving Oil and Gas Authority (OGA) approval in the UK, the Group converted its existing receivable in respect of the 
development of the Greater Stella Area to acquire a 20% ownership interest in the GSA field in the North Sea, UK (note 10). The Group revalued its loan 
receivable at the date of acquisition on a fair value basis using risk adjusted cash flow projections (a Level 3 measurement) discounted at a post-tax rate 
of 9.5% (2016: 9.5%) which resulted in a US$77m pre-tax impairment charge (post-tax US$77m) for the period up to the date of acquisition, including a 
gain of US$6m between 30 June 2017 and the date of acquisition, in the Integrated Energy Services reporting segment (2016: pre-tax US$3m, post-tax 
US$3m). The oil price assumptions used were the same as those disclosed in note 10 on page 141.
Group reorganisation and redundancy costs
The Group recognised a charge of US$4m, post-tax US$4m relating to staff redundancy costs and office closure costs mainly attributable to the 
Engineering & Production Services reporting segment (2016: US$6m, post-tax US$5m).
Onerous leasehold property provision
An onerous leasehold property provision of US$12m was recognised for the estimated future costs relating to vacant and under utilised leasehold office 
buildings in the UK for which the leases expire in 2024 and 2026 respectively (note 28).
Other exceptional items
Other exceptional items include US$16m (post-tax US$16m) of legal and professional fees incurred in relation to the ongoing SFO investigation into  
the Group (2016: US$8m, post-tax US$8m) and Mexican Production Enhancement Contract (PEC) migration costs of US$1m, post-tax US$1m  
(2016: US$1m, post-tax US$1m).
Taxation
US$11m of foreign exchange gains on the retranslation of deferred tax balances denominated in Malaysian ringgits have been recognised during the 
year in respect of oil and gas activities in Malaysia, relating to the Integrated Energy Services reporting segment, due to an approximate 10% 
strengthening in the Malaysian ringgit against the US dollar (2016: US$5m loss).
Fair value re-measurements and net costs relating to the cessation of the Berantai RSC contract
During 2016, the Group reached mutual agreement with PETRONAS for the cessation of the Berantai Risk Service Contract (RSC) with effect from  
30 September 2016 and as a result recognised an exceptional charge of US$33m (post-tax US$30m) in the consolidated income statement in the 
Integrated Energy Services reporting segment. 
Ticleni onerous contract provision and foreign currency translation losses on disposal of subsidiary
During 2016, an onerous contract provision of US$9m (post-tax US$9m) was recognised in the Integrated Energy Services reporting segment 
principally to reflect the final commercial settlement in respect of the exit from the Ticleni Production Enhancement Contract (PEC) in Romania. In 
addition, foreign currency translation losses of US$11m (post-tax US$11m) were reclassified from the consolidated statement of other comprehensive 
income to exceptional items in the Integrated Energy Services reporting segment upon disposal of the Ticleni PEC in Romania (note 26).

The split of the Group’s tax charge between current and deferred tax varies from year to year depending largely on:
• the variance between tax provided on the percentage of completion of projects compared to that paid on accrued income for engineering, 
procurement and construction contracts; and 
• the tax deductions available for expenditure on Production Sharing Contract (PSC) and Production Enhancement Contracts (PECs), which are 
partially offset by the creation of losses.
See 7c below for the impact on the movements in the year.
Included within the US$39m deferred tax derecognition is $38m resulting from a combination of the previously announced changes in UK tax loss relief 
rules, which were enacted in October 2017 , and reduction in UK profit forecasts.
The increase in the sterling to US dollar exchange rate resulted in an increase on translation of the net deferred tax asset in the UK.

138 / Petrofac Annual report and accounts 2017
NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2017
CONTINUED A number of factors have impacted the overall effective tax rate, with the key drivers being: the realisation of impairments without tax benefits and certain 
re-measurements which are not subject to tax, changes in the recognition of deferred tax and expenditure which is not deductible for tax purposes. 
In line with prior years, the effective tax rate is also driven by the tax laws in the jurisdictions where the Group operates and generates profits.

Included within the net deferred tax asset are tax losses of US$688m (2016: $659m). This represents the losses which are expected to be utilised  
based on Management’s projection of future taxable profits in the jurisdictions in which the losses reside.
The movements in deferred tax balances include foreign exchange on consolidation and elements included within business combinations within 
exceptional items and certain re-measurements (notes 5 and 10) and are therefore not part of the tax charge/(credit) to the consolidated income 
statement for the year. These include deferred tax assets and liabilities, which net to US$nil, with respect to the acquisition of Greater Stella Area (GSA) 
licence and reclassification of deferred tax balances with respect to the migration of Santuario from a Production Enhancement Contract (PEC) to a 
Production Sharing Contract (PSC).
d. Unrecognised tax losses and tax credits
Deferred income tax assets are recognised for tax loss carry forwards and tax credits to the extent that the realisation of the related tax benefit through 
offset against future taxable profits is probable. The Group did not recognise gross deferred income tax assets on tax losses of US$1,157m (2016: 
US$524m).

Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the profit for the year attributable to Petrofac Limited shareholders by the weighted average number  
of ordinary shares outstanding during the year.
Diluted earnings per share is calculated by dividing the profit attributable to Petrofac Limited shareholders, after adjusting for any dilutive effect, by the 
weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year, adjusted for the effects of ordinary shares granted under the share-based 
payment plans which are held in trust.

10 Business combination
Greater Stella Area (GSA) licence
On 21 September 2017 , upon receiving Oil and Gas Authority (OGA) approval in the UK, the Group acquired a 20% ownership interest in the GSA field  
in the North Sea. The transaction was treated as an acquisition of an interest in a joint operation and IFRS 3 ‘Business combination’ requirements were 
applied. The interest acquired is classified as a joint operation, as contractually all the decisions concerning the relevant activities of the unincorporated joint 
arrangement require unanimous consent of the joint arrangement partners. The acquisition related to the Integrated Energy Services reporting segment.
The Group’s share of the fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities of the joint operation recognised at the date of acquisition was as follows:

140 / Petrofac Annual report and accounts 2017
NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2017
CONTINUED At the date of acquisition, the receivable in respect of the GSA development had a carrying amount of US$250m (note 18) of which, US$210m was 
contributed to acquire a 20% ownership interest in the joint operation which resulted in no gain or loss on the transaction. The remaining US$40m was 
recognised as a long-term receivable from the GSA joint operation partners (note 18). 
The fair value of property, plant and equipment was determined using risk adjusted cash flow projections (Level 3 of the ‘fair value hierarchy’ contained 
within IFRS 13 ‘Fair value measurement’) discounted at a post-tax rate of 9.5%. Management used forward curve oil prices of US$53 per barrel and 
forward curve gas prices of US$6 per mcf from the date of acquisition until June 2019. For later periods, the long-term planning oil price assumptions 
used were US$70 per barrel from July 2019 to December 2019, and US$75 per barrel for 2020 and beyond. The long-term planning gas price 
assumptions used were US$8 per mcf from July 2019 to December 2019, and US$9 per mcf for 2020 and beyond.
The financial asset represents the discounted value of the long-term receivables due from the GSA joint operation partners and is accounted for on an 
amortised cost basis using a contractually agreed discount rate of 8.5% with the unwinding interest income being recognised as finance income in the 
consolidated income statement.
There are no cash outflows arising from the transaction.
From the date of acquisition, the joint operation contributed US$20m of revenue and US$3m of profit to the Group. If the above business combination 
had taken place upon achieving first oil in February 2017 , the Group’s share of revenue and profit for the year ended 31 December 2017 from the GSA 
joint operation would have been US$37m and US$4m respectively.
Migration of Santuario Production Enhancement Contract (PEC) to Production Sharing Contract (PSC) 
On 18 December 2017 , the Group migrated its existing Santuario PEC to acquire a 36% ownership interest in the PSC. The Group now has a 
proportional interest in the PSC assets, operates under a different commercial model and acts as an Operator on behalf of the joint arrangement 
partners. The PSC will run for 25 years, with two optional five-year extensions. The PSC was treated as a joint operation since contractually all the 
decisions concerning the relevant activities of the unincorporated joint arrangement require unanimous consent of the joint arrangement partners.  
The transaction was treated as an acquisition of an interest in a joint operation and IFRS 3 ‘Business combination’ requirements were applied.  
The acquisition related to the Integrated Energy Services reporting segment.
At the date of acquisition, the existing oil and gas assets of the Santuario PEC were fair valued using the risk adjusted cash flow projections (Level 3 of the  
‘fair value hierarchy’ contained within IFRS 13 ‘Fair value measurement’) discounted at a post-tax rate of 9.5%. The oil price assumptions used by 
Management were the same as those disclosed in note 5 on page 137 . This resulted in an impairment charge of US$29m (post-tax US$20m) being 
recognised as an exceptional item in the consolidated income statement (note 5). The carrying amount of the assets and liabilities shown below relating to the 
Santuario PEC were derecognised from the consolidated statement of financial position and represented the fair value of consideration for acquiring a 36% 
ownership interest in the PSC.

those disclosed in note 5 on page 137 .
There are no cash outflows arising from the transaction.
From the date of acquisition, the PSC contributed US$1m of revenue and US$293,000 of profit to the Group. If the above business combination had 
taken place at the beginning of the year, the Group’s share of revenue and loss for the year ended 31 December 2017 from the PSC would have been 
US$24m and US$2m respectively.

the North Sea, UK and US$213m (note 10) from the acquisition of a 36% ownership interest in the Santuario Production Sharing Contract (PSC).
Additions to oil and gas assets mainly comprise GSA capital expenditure of US$63m (2016: Santuario, Magallanes and Arenque PECs of US$12m). 
Additions to land, buildings and leasehold improvements mainly comprise project camps and temporary facilities linked to the Engineering & 
Construction reporting segment.

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2017
CONTINUED During 2017 , oil and gas assets having a carrying amount of US$129m (note 10) relating to Santuario Production Enhancement Contract (PEC) in Mexico 
were derecognised and converted to a 36% ownership interest in Production Sharing Contract (PSC). 
During 2017 , the Group renegotiated its existing finance leases relating to Block PM304 in Malaysia. As a result, the Group derecognised its existing 
finance lease assets included within oil and gas facilities with a carrying amount of US$148m and re-recognised finance lease assets of US$179m, 
under the revised finance lease terms, also within oil and gas facilities. A net gain of US$4m (note 4e) was recognised on the re-recognition since the 
gain on re-recognition of finance lease asset was partly offset by a loss on re-recognition of finance lease liability, refer note 18 on page 150.
The negative transfer from intangible oil and gas assets of US$1m relating to Block PM304 in Malaysia is due to the reversal of excess capital 
expenditure accruals recorded in the prior year (2016: US$5m).
The disposal of oil and gas facilities having a carrying amount of US$10m relates to a disposal of the FPSO Opportunity vessel attributable to the 
Integrated Energy Services reporting segment (note 5).
Of the total charge for depreciation in the consolidated income statement, US$149m (2016: US$162m) is included in cost of sales and US$17m  
(2016: US$20m) in selling, general and administration expenses.
At 31 December 2017 , US$393m relating to the JSD6000 installation vessel was reclassified from assets under construction to assets held for sale  
(note 14). Borrowing costs capitalised on construction of the JSD6000 installation vessel in 2017 amounted to US$2m (2016: US$2m). 
Included in ‘oil and gas facilities’ and ‘plant and equipment’ is property, plant and equipment under finance lease agreements, for which the net book

Goodwill resulting from business combinations has been allocated to two cash-generating units for impairment testing as follows: 
• Engineering & Construction
• Engineering & Production Services 
These cash-generating units represent the lowest level within the Group at which goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes. The Group 
considers cash-generating units to be individually significant where they represent greater than 25% of the total goodwill balance. 
Recoverable amounts have been determined based on value in use calculations, using discounted pre-tax cash flow projections. Management has 
adopted projection periods appropriate to each unit’s value in use. For the Engineering & Construction and Engineering & Production Services 
cash-generating units the cash flow projections are based on a five-year business plan approved by the Board.

Key assumptions used in value in use calculations
Market share: the key management assumptions relate to maintaining existing levels of business and growing organically in international markets.
Discount rate: management has used a pre-tax discount rate of 11.6% per annum (2016: 11.6% per annum) derived from the estimated weighted 
average cost of capital of the Group. A 100 basis point increase in the pre-tax discount rate to 12.6% would result in no additional impairment charges.
14 Assets held for sale
The JSD6000 installation vessel (the ‘vessel’) had a pre-impairment carrying amount of US$393m at 31 December 2017 , and was reclassified from 
assets under construction within property, plant and equipment to assets held for sale, since the vessel’s carrying amount is expected to be recovered 
principally through a disposal transaction rather than through its intended use. Based on discussions with potential counterparties, Management has 
determined that the recoverable amount of the vessel (fair value less costs of disposal) was lower than its carrying amount and as a result has 
recognised an impairment charge of US$176m as an exceptional item (note 5) in the consolidated income statement. The vessel is available for 
immediate sale in its present condition and location. The disposal is expected to be completed within 12 months from the end of the reporting period 
and relates to the Engineering & Construction reporting segment.
The fair value less cost of disposal of the vessel used in the impairment calculation on reclassifying the vessel as an asset held for sale was considered 
by Management to be a reasonable estimate. Commercial negotiations with the counterparty had not concluded at the end of the reporting period and 
the final contractual fair value less cost of disposal in the sale and purchase agreement may be less than the amount used in the reclassification 
impairment calculation. If this were to occur then an additional impairment charge would be recognised in the consolidated income statement.

During 2016, the Group signed a sale and purchase agreement with Schlumberger for the disposal of its Pánuco Production Enhancement Contract 
(PEC) in Mexico. The disposal, which related to Integrated Energy Services reporting segment, was completed in 2017 and no gain or loss was 
recognised. The net assets of Pánuco PEC at the time of disposal were US$95m, where US$1m represented a working capital change during the year. 
As part of the disposal proceeds, US$10m was received in cash during August 2017 and the balance of US$85m (note 18), discounted using post-tax 
rate of 9.5%, represents deferred consideration recoverable over a period of 12 years and is primarily contingent upon Pánuco PEC being migrated to a 
Production Sharing Contract (PSC). The deferred consideration was initially recorded at fair value and will subsequently be also measured at fair value 
through profit or loss with any fair value gains and losses recorded as an exceptional item in the consolidated income statement. The unwinding of the 
discount on the deferred consideration of US$3m was recognised as finance income in the consolidated income statement.

on the Group’s assets in Malaysia.
Accrual adjustment of US$9m (2016: US$11m) represents a reversal of excess capital expenditure accruals in the prior year. 
During 2017 , intangible oil and gas assets having a carrying amount of US$5m (note 10) relating to Santuario Production Enhancement Contract (PEC)  
in Mexico were derecognised and converted to a 36% ownership interest in a Production Sharing Contract (PSC). 
Other intangible assets
Other intangible assets comprising project development expenditure, customer contracts, proprietary software and patent technology are being 
amortised over their estimated economic useful life on a straight-line basis and the related amortisation charges included in cost of sales and selling, 
general and administration expenses (note 4b and 4c).

The receivable from the Greater Stella Area (GSA) joint operation partners represents the discounted value of the long-term receivables due from the 
GSA joint operation partners, recognised from the acquisition of a 20% ownership interest in the GSA field in the North Sea, UK (note 10) and is 
accounted for on an amortised cost basis using a contractually agreed discount rate of 8.5% with the unwinding interest income being recognised as 
finance income in the consolidated income statement. During the year, the Group recognised unwinding interest income of US$4m (2016: US$nil).
The current and non-current receivable from joint operation partners represents the 70% gross up on the finance lease liability in respect of oil and gas 
facilities relating to Block PM304 in Malaysia that are included 100% in the Group’s consolidated statement of financial position. This treatment is necessary 
to reflect the legal position of the Group as the contracting entity for this lease. The Group’s 30% share of this liability is US$163m (2016: US$177m). 
During 2017 , advances relating to the decommissioning provision of US$12m were reclassified from trade and other receivables to non-current other 
financial assets and represents advance payments to PETRONAS for settling decommissioning liability, relating to Block PM304 in Malaysia, when they 
become due.
Restricted cash comprises deposits with financial institutions and joint operation partners securing various guarantees and performance bonds 
associated with the Group’s operating activities (note 30). This cash will be released on the maturity of these guarantees and performance bonds 
assuming that the related conditions to release such amounts were satisfied.

The Group records the gross liability for finance leases in its financial statements, however the cashflows above represent the Group’s 30% share  
of the payments.
During 2017 , the Group renegotiated its existing finance leases relating to Block PM304 in Malaysia. As a result, the Group derecognised its existing 
finance lease liabilities of US$506m (Group’s 30% ownership interest US$152m) and re-recognised finance lease liabilities of US$597m (Group’s 30% 
ownership interest US$179m), under the revised finance lease terms. A net gain of US$4m (note 4e) was recognised on the re-recognition since the gain 
on re-recognition of finance lease asset was partly offset by a loss on re-recognition of finance lease liability, refer note 11 on page 143.
Fair value measurement
The following financial instruments are measured at fair value using the hierarchy below for determination and disclosure of their respective fair values:
Level 1: Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical financial assets or liabilities
Level 2:  Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. 
derived from prices)
Level 3: Valuation techniques for which the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement is unobservable

The Group considers that the carrying amounts of trade and other receivables, work-in-progress, trade and other payables, other current  
and non-current financial assets and liabilities approximate their fair values and are therefore excluded from the above table.
The fair value of the financial assets and liabilities is included at the amount at which the instrument could be exchanged in a current transaction 
between willing parties, other than in a forced or liquidation sale. 
The following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair values:
• The Group enters into derivative financial instruments with various counterparties, principally financial institutions with investment grade credit ratings. 
Derivatives valued using valuation techniques with market observable inputs are mainly foreign exchange forward contracts and oil derivatives. 
Externally provided sources of quoted market prices have been used to determine the fair values of forward currency contracts and oil derivatives. 
• The fair values of long-term interest-bearing loans and borrowings and finance lease creditors are equivalent to their amortised costs determined  
as the present value of discounted future cash flows using the effective interest rate.
• The Pánuco deferred consideration, discounted using a post-tax rate of 9.5%, represents deferred consideration recoverable over a period of 12 
years and is primarily contingent upon the Pánuco Production Enhancement Contract (PEC) being migrated to a Production Sharing Contract (PSC). 
The carrying amount of the deferred consideration is not considered to be sensitive to any changes to these inputs since the terms of the deferred 
consideration ensure that the Group will recover the carrying amount of the deferred consideration over the 12 year period.

part of the final settlement on the projects. Management reviewed the recoverability of these receivables and concluded that these will be recovered in full and no impairment provision is 
necessary at the end of the reporting period.

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2017
CONTINUED The credit quality of trade receivables that are neither past due nor impaired is assessed by management with reference to the historic payment track 
records of the counterparties together with the relevant current information.
In the ordinary course of business in engineering, procurement and construction project execution services contracts, customers retain amounts of 
progress billings (retentions receivables) that are not paid until the satisfaction of conditions specified in the contract for the payment of such amounts  
or until defects have been rectified.
During 2017 , trade receivables amounting to US$128m (note 10) relating to the Santuario Production Enhancement Contract (PEC) in Mexico were 
derecognised and converted to a 36% ownership interest in Production Sharing Contract (PSC). Also trade receivables of US$12m relating to advance 
payments to PETRONAS for settling decommissioning liabilities relating to Block PM304 in Malaysia when they become due, were reclassified to 
non-current other financial assets, note 18 (2016: trade and other receivables of US$78m were reclassified to assets held for sale, note 14).
Advances represent payments made to certain subcontractors for projects in progress, that will be adjusted against the future progress billings by  
the subcontractors. 
Receivables from joint operation partners are amounts recoverable from partners on Block PM304, Santuario PSC and on consortium contracts in  
the Engineering & Construction reporting segment.
Other receivables mainly consist of Value Added Tax recoverable of US$77m (2016: US$66m).
All trade and other receivables are expected to be settled in cash. Certain trade and other receivables will be settled in cash using currencies other than 
the reporting currency of the Group, and will be largely paid in sterling, euros and Kuwaiti dinars.

Financial statements 24 Treasury shares
For the purpose of making awards under the Group’s share-based payment plans, shares in the Company are purchased and held by the Petrofac 
Employee Benefit Trust and the Petrofac Joint Venture Companies Employee Benefit Trust. These shares have been classified in the consolidated 
statement of financial position as treasury shares within equity.

25 Share-based payment plans
Performance Share Plan (PSP)
Under the PSP , share awards are granted to Executive Directors and a restricted number of other senior executives of the Group. The shares vest at the 
end of three years subject to continued employment and the achievement of certain pre-defined market and non-market-based performance 
conditions. The Group revised its PSP during 2017 , and the market performance based element of new awards will be 70% dependent on the total 
shareholder return (TSR) of the Group compared with an index composed of selected relevant companies (for earlier awards TSR was 50%). The fair 
value of the shares vesting under this portion of the award is determined by an independent valuer using a Monte Carlo simulation model taking into 
account the terms and conditions of the plan rules and using the following assumptions at the date of grant:

Fair value of TSR portion 99p 124p 747p 562p 827p
The non-market-based condition governing the vesting of the remaining 30% of the 2017 awards is subject to achieving certain strategic targets i.e. 
cumulative Engineering & Construction business performance net income, cumulative Engineering & Production Services business performance net 
income, cumulative divestment proceeds and cumulative cash conversion over a three-year period. Each strategic target accounts for 7 .5% for the 
purposes of awards vesting. For earlier awards 50% of the total award is subject to achieving between 0.0% and 7 .5% earnings per share (EPS) growth 
targets over a three-year period. The fair value of the equity-settled award relating to the non-market-based condition is estimated, based on the quoted 
closing market price of the Company’s ordinary shares at the date of grant with an assumed annual vesting rate built into the calculation (subsequently 
trued up to the end of the reporting period on the actual leaver rate during the period from award date to the end of the reporting period) over the 
three-year vesting period of the plan. 
Deferred Bonus Share Plan (DBSP)
Under the DBSP selected employees are required to defer a proportion of their annual cash bonus into Company shares (‘Invested Shares’). Following 
such an award, the Company will generally grant the participant an additional award of shares (‘Matching Shares’) bearing a specified ratio to the 
number of Invested Shares, typically a 1:1 ratio. Subject to a participant’s continued employment, Invested and Matching Share awards may either vest 
100% on the third anniversary of the grant date; or alternatively, vest one-third on the first anniversary of the grant, one-third on the second anniversary 
and the final proportion on the third anniversary of the grant date.
At the end of the reporting period the value of bonuses to be settled by shares cannot be determined until the Remuneration Committee has approved 
the portion of the employee bonuses to be settled in shares. Once the portion of the bonus to be settled in shares is determined, the final bonus liability 
to be settled in shares is transferred to the reserve for share-based payments. The costs relating to Matching Shares are recognised over the 
corresponding vesting period and the fair values of the equity-settled Matching Shares granted to employees are based on the quoted closing market 
price at the date of grant with the charge to the consolidated income statement adjusted to reflect the expected vesting rate of the plan.
Share Incentive Plan (SIP)
All UK employees, including UK Executive Directors, are eligible to participate in the SIP . Employees may invest up to sterling £1,800 per tax year  
of gross salary (or, if lower, 10% of salary) to purchase ordinary shares in the Company. There is no holding period for these shares.
Restricted Share Plan (RSP)
Selected employees are allocated grants of shares on an ad hoc basis. The RSP is primarily, but not exclusively, used to make awards to individuals 
who join the Group part way through the year, having left accrued benefits with a previous employer. The fair values of the awards granted under the 
RSP at various grant dates during the year are based on the quoted market price at the date of grant adjusted for an assumed vesting rate over the 
relevant vesting period.

Net unrealised gains/(losses) on derivatives
The portion of gains or losses on cash flow hedging instruments that are determined to be effective hedges is included within this reserve net of related 
deferred tax effects. When the hedged transaction occurs or is no longer forecast to occur, the gain or loss is transferred from equity to the consolidated 
income statement. Realised net loss amounting to US$13m (2016: US$3m net gain) relating to foreign currency forward contracts and financial 
instruments designated as cash flow hedges have been recognised in cost of sales.
The forward currency points element and ineffective portion of derivative financial instruments relating to forward currency contracts and losses on 
undesignated derivatives amounting to US$5m (2016: US$1m) have been recognised in cost of sales.
Net unrealised gains/(losses) on available-for-sale investment
This reserve recognises fair value changes, net of deferred tax effects on available-for-sale investment held by the Group. Realised gains and losses on 
the sale of available-for-sale investment are recognised as other operating income or other operating expenses in the consolidated income statement. 
Unrealised losses are recognised as exceptional items in the consolidated income statement.
Foreign currency translation reserve
The assets and liabilities of operations which have a non-United States dollar functional currency are translated into the Group’s reporting currency, 
United States dollar, at the exchange rate prevailing at the end of the reporting period. The exchange rate differences arising on the translation are 
recognised in other reserves in equity.

The reserve for share-based payments is used to recognise the value of equity-settled share-based payments awarded to employees and transfers out 
of this reserve are made upon vesting of the original share awards.
The transfer during the year reflects the transfer from accrued expenses within trade and other payables of the bonus liability in the consolidated 
statement of financial position relating to the year ended 2016 of US$16m (2015 bonus of US$17m) which has been voluntarily elected or mandatorily

Details of the Group’s interest-bearing loans and borrowings are as follows:
Senior Notes
Petrofac has an outstanding aggregate principal amount of US$677m Senior Notes due in 2018 (Notes). The Group pays interest on the Senior Notes  
at an annual rate equal to 3.40% of the outstanding principal amount. Interest on the Notes is payable semi-annually in arrears in April and October  
each year. 
Revolving Credit Facility
Petrofac has a US$1,200m committed Revolving Credit Facility with a syndicate of international banks, which is available for general corporate 
purposes. US$1,000m of the facility was extended in May 2017 and will mature in June 2021. The remaining US$200 million will mature in June 2020.  
As at 31 December 2017 , US$555m was drawn under this facility (2016: US$645m).
Interest is payable on the drawn balance of the facility and in addition utilisation fees are payable depending on the level of utilisation.
Export Credit Agency funding
In 2015, Petrofac entered into two term loan facilities guaranteed, respectively, by the Italian Export Credit Agency SACE and the UK Export Credit 
Agency UKEF. Drawings were made up to February 2017 and no further drawings can be made. Both facilities amortise over eight and a half years 
ending in 2025. As at 31 December 2017 , US$50m was drawn under the SACE facility (2016: US$54m) and US$83m was drawn under the UKEF  
facility (2016: US$86m). 
Term loans
In August 2016, Petrofac entered into two term loans of US$200m and AED368m. These facilities matured and were repaid in August 2017 and 
November 2017 respectively.
In August 2017 , Petrofac entered into two new term loans of $100m each, which mature in February 2019 and August 2019 respectively.
Bank overdrafts
Bank overdrafts are drawn down in United States dollar and sterling denominations to meet the Group’s working capital requirements. These are 
repayable on demand.
The Revolving Credit Facility, the Export Credit Agency loans facilities and the term loans (together, the Senior Loans) are subject to two financial 
covenants relating to leverage and interest cover. The Group was in compliance with these covenants for the year ending 31 December 2017 . 
The Senior Loans and the Senior Notes (together, the Senior Facilities) are senior unsecured obligations of the Company and will rank equally in right of 
payment with each other and with the Company’s other existing and future unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness. Petrofac International Ltd and 
Petrofac International (UAE) LLC irrevocably and unconditionally guarantee, jointly and severally, the due and prompt payment of all amounts at any time 
becoming due and payable in respect of the Senior Facilities.

Provision for decommissioning
The decommissioning provision primarily relates to the Group’s obligation for the removal of facilities and restoration of the sites at the Block PM304 in 
Malaysia, Chergui in Tunisia and Santuario, Magallanes and Arenque in Mexico.
The Group recognised US$19m (note 10) of provision for decommissioning from the acquisition of a 20% ownership interest in the Greater Stella Area (GSA) 
field in the North Sea, UK and US$5m (note 10) from the acquisition of a 36% ownership interest in the Santuario Production Sharing Contract (PSC).
Additional provision of US$1m was recognised for Block PM304 in Malaysia relating to drilling of new wells during the year (2016: revision to 
decommissioning cost estimates of US$101m (note 11) were made in respect of Santuario, Magallanes, Arenque and Pánuco in Mexico of US$97m and 
Block PM304 in Malaysia of US$4m).
The liability is discounted at the rate of 4.5% on Block PM304 (2016: 4.5%), 6.0% on Chergui (2016: 6.0%) and 7 .5% on Santuario, Magallanes and 
Arenque (2016: 6.2%).
The unwinding of the discount is recognised in the finance costs (note 6) line item of the consolidated income statement. The Group estimates that the 
cash outflows associated with these provisions will materialise in 2026 on Block PM304, 2031 on Chergui, 2042 on Santuario, 2033 on Magallanes and 
2040 on Arenque.
Onerous operating lease provision
Onerous operating lease provision represents the non-current amount of the estimated future costs relating to vacant and under utilised leasehold office 
buildings in the UK, for which the leases expire between 2024 to 2026. Additions to onerous operating lease provision of US$12m during the year were 
recognised as an exceptional item in the consolidated income statement and relate to the Engineering & Productions Services reporting segment (note 5).

(2016: trade and other payables of US$13m relating to Pánuco PEC in Mexico were reclassified to liabilities associated with assets held for sale, note 14).
Accrued expenses include capital expenditure accruals relating to property, plant and equipment of US$74m (2016: US$69m) and Group’s 30% share 
of intangible oil and gas assets relating to Block PM304 in Malaysia of US$2m (2016: US$12m). The balance of accrued expenses primarily represents 
project cost accruals relating to the Engineering & Construction reporting segment and the Engineering & Production Services reporting segment.
Advances received from customers represent payments received for contracts, that will be adjusted against the future progress billings to be made to 
the customers.
Other payables mainly consists of retentions held against subcontractors of US$115m (2016: US$88m) and amounts payable to joint operation partners 
of US$20m (2016: US$27m).
Certain trade and other payables will be settled in currencies other than the reporting currency of the Group, mainly in sterling, euros and Kuwaiti dinars.
30 Commitments and contingent liabilities
Commitments
In the normal course of business the Group will obtain surety bonds, letters of credit and guarantees, which are contractually required to secure 
performance, advance payment or in lieu of retentions being withheld. Some of these facilities are secured by issue of corporate guarantees by the 
Company in favour of the issuing banks.
At 31 December 2017 , the Group had outstanding letters of guarantee, including performance, advance payments and bid bonds of US$4,923m  
(2016: US$4,862m) against which the Group had pledged or restricted cash balances of, in aggregate, US$49m (2016: US$47m).
At 31 December 2017 , the Group had outstanding forward exchange contracts amounting to US$3,045m (2016: US$3,754m). These commitments 
consist of future gross obligations either to acquire or to sell designated amounts of foreign currency at agreed rates and value dates (note 33).

33 Risk management and financial instruments
Risk management objectives and policies
The Group’s principal financial assets and liabilities, other than derivatives, comprise trade and other receivables, related party receivables, cash and 
short-term deposits, work-in-progress, interest-bearing loans and borrowings, trade and other payables and contingent consideration.
The Group’s activities expose it to various financial risks particularly associated with interest rate risk on its variable rate cash and short-term deposits, 
loans and borrowings and foreign currency risk on conducting business in currencies other than reporting currency as well as translation of the assets 
and liabilities of foreign operations to the reporting currency. These risks are managed from time to time by using a combination of various derivative 
instruments, principally forward currency contracts in line with the Group’s hedging policies. The Group has a policy not to enter into speculative trading 
of financial derivatives.
The Board of Directors of the Company has established an Audit Committee which performs, amongst other roles, reviews on the effectiveness of the 
risk management and internal control systems to mitigate a range of risks, including financial risks, faced by the Group which is discussed in detail on 
pages 82 to 87 .
The other main risks besides interest rate and foreign currency risk arising from the Group’s financial instruments are credit risk, liquidity risk and 
commodity price risk and the policies relating to these risks are discussed in detail below:
Interest rate risk
Interest rate risk arises from the possibility that changes in interest rates will affect the value of the Group’s interest-bearing financial liabilities and assets.
The Group’s exposure to market risk arising from changes in interest rates relates primarily to the Group’s long-term variable rate debt obligations and  
its cash and bank balances. The Group’s policy is to manage its interest cost using a mix of fixed and variable rate debt. The Group’s cash and bank 
balances are at floating rates of interest.
 
Petrofac Annual report and accounts 2017 / 161
Financial statements 33 Risk management and financial instruments continued
Debt is primarily in US dollar, linked to US dollar LIBOR (London Interbank Offered Rate). The Group uses derivatives to swap between fixed and floating 
rates. No such derivatives were outstanding at 31 December 2017 . The proportion of floating rate debt at 31 December 2017 was 58% of the total 
financial debt outstanding (2016: 63%).
Interest rate sensitivity analysis
The impact on the Group’s profit before tax and equity due to a reasonably possible change in interest rates on loans and borrowings at the reporting 
date is demonstrated in the table below. The analysis assumes that all other variables remain constant.

CONTINUED Foreign currency risk
The Group is exposed to foreign currency risk on sales, purchases, and translation of assets and liabilities that are in a currency other than the functional 
currency of its operating units. The Group is also exposed to the translation of the functional currencies of its units to the United States dollar reporting 
currency of the Group. 
The following table summarises the percentage of foreign currency denominated revenues, costs, financial assets and financial liabilities, expressed in 
United States dollar terms, of the Group totals.

Current financial assets 23.0% 18.8%
Non-current financial liabilities 0.0% 0.0%
Current financial liabilities 26.4% 30.2%
The Group uses forward currency contracts to manage the currency exposure on transactions significant to its operations. It is the Group’s policy not  
to enter into forward contracts until a highly probable forecast transaction is in place and to negotiate the terms of the derivative instruments used for 
hedging to match the terms of the hedged item to maximise hedge effectiveness.
Foreign currency sensitivity analysis
The income statements of foreign operations are translated into the reporting currency using a weighted average exchange rate of conversion. Foreign 
currency monetary items are translated using the closing rate at the reporting date. Revenues and costs in currencies other than the functional currency 
of an operating unit are recorded at the prevailing rate at the date of the transaction. The following significant exchange rates applied during the year in 
relation to United States dollars:
2017 2016
Average rate Closing rate Average rate Closing rate

were taken to equity and losses of US$11m (2016: loss of US$7m) were recycled from equity into cost of sales in the consolidated income statement. 
The forward points and ineffective portions of the above foreign exchange forward contracts and loss on undesignated derivatives of US$5m (2016: 
US$1m) were recognised in the consolidated income statement (note 4b).
Commodity price risk – oil prices
The Group is exposed to the impact of changes in oil and gas prices on its revenues and profits generated from sales of crude oil and gas. The Group’s 
policy is to manage its exposure to the impact of changes in oil and gas prices using derivative instruments, primarily swaps and collars. Hedging is only 
undertaken once sufficiently reliable and regular long-term forecast production data is available.
During the year the Group entered into various crude oil swaps hedging oil production of 388,816 barrels (bbl) (2016: 174,875 bbl) with maturities ranging 
from January 2018 to June 2018.
The fair value of oil derivatives at 31 December 2017 was a liability of US$2m (2016: US$2m liability) with net unrealised loss deferred in equity of US$2m 
(2016: US$2m loss). During the year, US$2m loss (2016: US$10m gain) was recycled from equity into the consolidated income statement on the 
occurrence of the hedged transactions and a loss in the fair value recognised in equity of US$2m (2016: US$5m loss).
The following table summarises the impact on the Group’s pre-tax profit and equity (due to a change in the fair value of oil derivative instruments and the

Credit risk
The Group trades only with recognised, creditworthy third parties. Business Unit Risk Review Committees (BURRC) evaluate the creditworthiness of each 
individual third party at the time of entering into new contracts. Limits have been placed on the approval authority of the BURRC above which the approval 
of the Board of Directors of the Company is required. Receivable balances are monitored on an ongoing basis with appropriate follow-up action taken 
where necessary. At 31 December 2017 , the Group’s five largest customers accounted for 62.3% of outstanding trade receivables, retention receivables, 
work in progress, receivable under Berantai RSC and receivable in respect of the development of the Greater Stella Area (2016: 56.9%).
With respect to credit risk arising from the other financial assets of the Group, which comprise cash and cash equivalents, current and non-current 
receivables from customers (including the Berantai RSC and Greater Stella Area projects) and certain derivative instruments, the Group’s exposure  
to credit risk arises from default of the counterparty, with a maximum exposure equal to the carrying amount of these instruments.
Liquidity risk
The Group’s objective is to ensure sufficient liquidity to support operations and future growth is available. The provision of financial capital and the 
potential impact on the Group’s capital structure is reviewed regularly. The Group is not exposed to any external capital constraints. The maturity profiles 
of the Group’s financial liabilities at 31 December are as follows:

Financial statements
COMPANY STATEMENT OF CHANGES IN EQUITY
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2017 1 Corporate information
Petrofac Limited is a limited liability company registered and domiciled in Jersey 
under the Companies (Jersey) Law 1991 and is the holding company for the 
international Group of Petrofac subsidiaries. The Group’s principal activity is the 
provision of services to the oil and gas production and processing industry.
The financial statements of Petrofac Limited (the ‘Company’) for the year 
ended 31 December 2017 were authorised for issue in accordance with  
a resolution of the Board of Directors on 28 February 2018.
2 Summary of significant accounting policies
Basis of preparation
The separate financial statements have been prepared on a historical cost 
basis, except for derivative financial instruments that have been measured at 
fair value. The functional and presentation currency of the separate financial 
statements is US dollars and all values in the separate financial statements 
are rounded to the nearest million (US$m) except where otherwise stated. 
Statement of compliance
The separate financial statements have been prepared in accordance  
with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as issued by  
the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) and applicable 
requirements of Jersey law.
Adoption of new financial reporting standards, amendments and 
interpretations
Effective new financial reporting amendments
The Company has adopted amendments issued by the International 
Accounting Standards Board (IASB) and the International Financial 
Reporting Interpretations Committee (IFRIC) of the IASB that are relevant 
to its operations and effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 
1 January 2017 . These were:
• Amendments to IAS 7 Statement of Cash Flows: Disclosure Initiative
• Amendments to IAS 12 Income Taxes: Recognition of Deferred Tax 
Assets for Unrealised Losses
These amendments did not have a material impact on the Company’s 
financial performance or position. However, the disclosures required by IAS 
7 have been provided in note 18 on page 182. No comparative information 
is presented as it is not mandatory in the first year of application.
Financial reporting standards and amendments issued but not 
yet effective
Standards issued but not yet effective up to the date of issuance of the 
Company’s financial statements are listed below and include only those 
standards and amendments that are likely to have an impact on the financial 
performance, position and disclosures of the Company at a future date. The 
Company intends to adopt these standards when they become effective.
IFRS 9 Financial Instruments
IFRS 9 brings together all three aspects of the accounting for financial 
instruments: classification and measurement, impairment and hedge 
accounting. IFRS 9 is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 
1 January 2018, with early application permitted. Except for hedge 
accounting, retrospective application is required but providing comparative 
information is not compulsory. For hedge accounting, the requirements are 
generally applied prospectively, with some limited exceptions.
The Company plans to adopt the new standard on the required effective 
date and will not restate comparative information. During 2017 , the Company 
performed a detailed impact assessment of all three aspects of IFRS 9. This 
assessment is based on currently available information and may be subject 
to changes arising from further reasonable and supportable information 
being made available to the Company in 2018 when the Company adopts 
IFRS 9. Overall, the Company expects no significant impact on its statement 
of financial position except for the effect of applying the impairment 
requirements of IFRS 9. The Company does not expect the transition 
adjustment impact at 1 January 2018 to be material. 
Classification and measurement
The Company does not expect a significant impact on its statement of 
financial position on applying the classification and measurement 
requirements of IFRS 9. 
Impairment
IFRS 9 requires the Company to record expected credit losses on all applicable 
financial assets, either on a 12-month or lifetime basis. The Company will apply 
the simplified approach and record lifetime expected losses on amounts due 
from subsidiaries and bank balances. The initial application of the standard is 
not expected to have a material impact on the opening retained earnings at 
1 January 2018.
Hedge accounting
The Company does not have any designated hedges, hence the hedge 
accounting requirements are not expected to have any impact on the 
financial performance or position of the Company.
The new standard also introduces expanded disclosure requirements and 
changes in presentation. These are expected to change the nature and 
extent of the Company’s disclosures about its financial instruments 
particularly in the year of the adoption of the new standard.
Investments in subsidiaries
Investments in subsidiaries are stated at cost less any provision  
for impairment.
Investments in associates
Investments in associates are stated at cost less any provision  
for impairment.
Financial assets
Initial recognition and measurement
Financial assets are classified, at initial recognition, as financial assets at 
fair value through profit or loss, loans and receivables, held-to-maturity 
investments, available-for-sale financial assets, or as derivatives 
designated as hedging instruments in an effective hedge, as appropriate. 
All financial assets are recognised initially at fair value plus, in the case of 
financial assets not recorded at fair value through profit or loss, transaction 
costs that are attributable to the acquisition of the financial asset.
Subsequent measurement
For purposes of subsequent measurement financial assets are classified 
in the following categories:
• Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss
• Loans and receivables
Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss
Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss include financial assets held 
for trading and financial assets designated upon initial recognition at fair value 
through profit or loss. Financial assets are classified as held for trading if they 
are acquired for the purpose of selling or repurchasing in the near term. 
Derivatives, including separated embedded derivatives, are also classified as 
held for trading unless they are designated as effective hedging instruments 
as defined by IAS 39 ‘Financial Instruments – Recognition and Measurement’ .
Loans and receivables
Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or 
determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market. After initial 
measurement, such financial assets are subsequently measured at 
amortised cost using the effective interest rate (EIR) method, less 
impairment. Amortised cost is calculated by taking into account any 
discount or premium on acquisition and fees or costs that are an integral 
part of the EIR. The EIR amortisation is included in finance income in the 
income statement. This category generally applies to trade and other 
receivables and amounts due from subsidiaries.

NOTES TO THE COMPANY FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2017 Financial liabilities
Initial recognition and measurement
Financial liabilities are classified, at initial recognition, as financial liabilities at 
fair value through profit or loss and other financial liabilities measured at 
amortised cost using the effective interest rate (EIR) method, or as derivatives 
designated as hedging instruments in an effective hedge, as appropriate.
All financial liabilities are recognised initially at fair value and, in the case  
of interest-bearing loans and borrowings and trade and other payables, 
net of directly attributable transaction costs.
The Company’s financial liabilities include interest-bearing loans and 
borrowings, trade and other payables, derivative financial instruments  
and amounts due to subsidiaries.
Subsequent measurement
For purposes of subsequent measurement financial assets are classified 
in the following categories:
• Financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss
• Loans and borrowings
Financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss
Financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss include financial 
liabilities held for trading and financial liabilities designated upon initial 
recognition as at fair value through profit or loss.
Financial liabilities are classified as held for trading if they are incurred for 
the purpose of repurchasing in the near term. This category also includes 
derivative financial instruments entered into by the Company that are not 
designated as hedging instruments in hedge relationships as defined by 
IAS 39 ‘Financial Instruments – Recognition and Measurement’. 
Separated embedded derivatives are also classified as held for trading 
unless they are designated as effective hedging instruments.
Gains or losses on liabilities held for trading are recognised in other 
operating income or other operating expenses of the income statement.
Financial liabilities designated at the initial date of recognition as fair value 
through profit or loss are designated only if the criteria in IAS 39 ‘Financial 
Instruments – Recognition and Measurement’ are satisfied.
Loans and borrowings
After initial recognition, interest-bearing loans and borrowings are 
subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate (EIR) 
method. Gains and losses are recognised in the income statement when the 
liabilities are derecognised as well as through the EIR amortisation process.
Amortised cost is calculated by taking into account any discount or 
premium on acquisition and fees or costs that are an integral part of the EIR. 
The EIR amortisation is included as finance costs in the income statement.
This category generally applies to interest-bearing loans and borrowings. 
For more information, see note 17 .
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents consist of cash at bank and in hand and 
short-term deposits with an original maturity of three months or less.  
For the purpose of the cash flow statement, cash and cash equivalents 
consists of cash and cash equivalents as defined above, net of any 
outstanding bank overdrafts.
Employee Benefit Trusts
The Petrofac Employee Benefit Trust and the Petrofac Joint Venture 
Companies Employee Benefit Trust (EBTs) are treated as extensions  
of the activities of the Company and accordingly the Company financial 
statements include all transactions and balances of the EBTs except  
for transaction and balances between the Company and the EBTs.
Share-based payment transactions
Employees receive remuneration in the form of share-based payment 
transactions, whereby employees render services in exchange for  
shares or rights over shares (‘equity-settled transactions’).
Equity-settled transactions
The cost of equity-settled transactions with employees is measured  
by reference to the fair value at the date on which they are granted. 
The cost of equity-settled transactions is recognised in the selling,  
general and administration expenses line item in the consolidated income 
statement, together with a corresponding increase in other reserves in the 
consolidated statement of financial position, over the period in which the 
relevant employees become entitled to the award (the ‘vesting period’). 
The cumulative expense recognised for equity-settled transactions at the 
end of the reporting period until the vesting date reflects the extent to which 
the vesting period has expired and the Group’s best estimate of the number 
of equity instruments that will ultimately vest. The charge or credit to the 
income statement for a period represents the movement in cumulative 
expense recognised from the beginning to the end of the reporting period.
No expense is recognised for awards that do not ultimately vest because 
non-market performance and/or service conditions have not been met. 
Where awards include a market or non-vesting condition, the transactions 
are treated as vested irrespective of whether the market or non-vesting 
condition is satisfied, provided that all other performance and/or service 
conditions are satisfied.
Equity awards cancelled, e.g. in case of good leavers, are treated as 
vesting immediately on the date of cancellation, and any expense not 
recognised for the award at that date is recognised in the consolidated 
income statement.
Significant accounting estimates
Sources of estimation uncertainty
The key assumptions concerning the future and other key sources of 
estimation uncertainty at the end of the reporting period that have a 
significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of 
assets and liabilities within the next financial year are discussed below:
• Recoverable amount of investments in subsidiaries and provision for 
doubtful debts on amounts due from subsidiaries: the Company 
determines at end of the reporting period whether there is any evidence 
of indicators of impairment in the carrying amount of its investments in 
subsidiaries. Where indicators exist, an impairment test is undertaken 
which requires management to estimate the recoverable amount of its 
assets which is based on its value in use. The value in use calculation is 
based on output of management’s business planning process which 
involves assumptions relating to, but not limited to, future profitability, 
discount rate and inflation. A similar exercise is undertaken to determine 
the recoverability of amounts due from subsidiaries, after initially 
assessing the net assets of the subsidiary. The carrying amount of 
investments in and amounts due from subsidiaries was US$227m and 
US$2, 105m respectively (2016: US$535m and US$2, 140m respectively).
Taxation
Profits arising in the Company for the 2017 year of assessment will be 
subject to Jersey tax at the standard corporate income tax rate of 0%.

Other expenses mainly include legal and professional expenses of US$16m (2016: US$7m).
At 31 December 2017 , one of the subsidiaries of the Company provided a financial guarantee to Petrofac UK Holdings Limited and Petrofac Facilities 
Management Limited in respect of the amounts owed by these entities to the Company, for a period of at least twelve months from the end of reporting 
period. This resulted in a reversal of earlier impairment provisions booked against amounts due from subsidiaries of US$294m (2016:US$nil). 
As a result of additional fair value losses recognised on the receivable in respect of the development of Greater Stella Area (GSA) and lower activity levels 
in the UK North Sea for one of the Company’s subsidiary, the Company undertook a review of impairment for its investments in subsidiaries and 
recoverability of amounts due from subsidiaries. The review was carried out on a value in use basis discounted at a pre-tax rate of 11.6% (for GSA the 
same assumptions were used as those disclosed in note 5 on page 136). This resulted in an impairment of investment in subsidiaries of US$308m 
(2016: US$nil) and a provision for doubtful debts on amounts due from subsidiaries of US$42m (2016: US$89m).

Reserve for share-based payments
The reserve for share-based payments is used to record the value of equity-settled share-based payment plans awarded to employees and transfers 
out of this reserve are made upon vesting of the original share awards. The transfer during the year of US$35m (2016: US$34m) represents the charge 
for share-based payments awards by the Company to its own employees as well as employees of subsidiaries, including bonus amounts converted into

Fair value measurement
The following financial instruments are measured at fair value using the hierarchy below for determination and disclosure of their respective fair values:
Level 1: Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical financial assets or liabilities
Level 2:  Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly  
(i.e. derived from prices)
Level 3: Valuation techniques for which the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement is unobservable

19 Commitments and contingent liabilities
Commitments
In the normal course of business the Group will obtain surety bonds, letters of credit and guarantees, which are contractually required to secure 
performance, advance payment or in lieu of retentions being withheld. Some of these facilities are secured by issue of corporate guarantees on behalf  
of its subsidiaries by the Company in favour of the issuing banks.
At 31 December 2017 , the Company had outstanding letters of guarantee, including performance, advance payments and bid bonds, of US$728m 
(2016: US$455m).
At 31 December 2017 , the Company had outstanding forward exchange contracts amounting to US$2,949m (2016: US$2,843m). These commitments 
consist of future obligations either to acquire or to sell designated amounts of foreign currency at agreed rates and value dates (note 20).
Other matter
As described in pages 6, 31, 66 and 78 of the Annual Report, on 12 May 2017 , the UK Serious Fraud Office (SFO) announced an investigation into the 
activities of Petrofac, its subsidiaries, and their officers, employees and agents for suspected bribery, corruption, and/or money laundering. The SFO 
investigation is ongoing. The existence, timing and amount of any future financial obligations (such as fines or penalties) or other consequences are 
unable to be determined at this time and no liability has been recognised in relation to this matter in the consolidated statement of financial position at 
the end of the reporting period.
20 Risk management and financial instruments
Risk management objectives and policies
The Company’s principal financial assets and liabilities are amounts due from and due to subsidiaries, forward currency contracts, cash and  
short-term deposits and interest-bearing loans and borrowings.
The Company’s activities expose it to various financial risks particularly associated with interest rate risks on its external variable rate loans and 
borrowings. The Company has a policy not to enter into speculative trading of financial derivatives.
The other main risks besides interest rate are foreign currency risk, credit risk and liquidity risk and the policies relating to these risks are discussed  
in detail below:
Interest rate risk
Interest rate risk arises from the possibility that changes in interest rates will affect the value of the Company’s interest-bearing financial liabilities and 
assets. The Company does not hedge its exposure on its interest-bearing funding to/from subsidiaries. 
Interest rate sensitivity analysis
The impact on the Company’s before tax profit and equity due to a reasonably possible change in interest rates is demonstrated in the table below.  
The analysis assumes that all other variables remain constant.

Credit risk
The Company’s principal financial assets are cash and short-term deposits and amounts due from subsidiaries.
The Company manages its credit risk in relation to cash and short-term deposits by only depositing cash with financial institutions that have high credit 
ratings provided by international credit rating agencies.
Liquidity risk
The Company’s objective is to maintain a balance between continuity of funding and flexibility through the use of Senior Notes, Revolving Credit Facility, 
Export Credit Agency funding and Term loans, to reduce its exposure to liquidity risk.

Shareholder warning
Shareholders should be very wary of any unsolicited advice, offers to buy 
shares at a discount or offers of free company reports on the Company. 
Fraudsters use persuasive and high pressure tactics to lure investors into 
scams and they may offer to sell shares that often turn out to be 
worthless, overpriced or even non-existent. Whilst high returns are 
promised, those who invest usually end up losing their money. 
Please keep in mind that firms authorised by the Financial Conduct 
Authority (‘FCA’) are unlikely to contact you out of the blue. If you receive 
any unsolicited investment advice:
• Make sure you get the correct name of the person and organisation 
and make a record of any other information they give you, eg telephone 
number, address. Ask for their ‘firm reference number’ (FRN).
• Check that they are properly authorised by the FCA before getting 
involved. You can check the FCA register at: 
Website www.fca.org.uk  
Phone +44 (0)800 111 6768
• Report approaches to the FCA – a list of unauthorised overseas  
firms who are targeting, or have targeted, UK investors is maintained. 
Reporting such organisations means the list can be kept up to date 
and appropriate action be considered.
• Inform Link Market Services (Jersey) Limited, our Registrars. They are 
not able to investigate such incidents themselves, but will record the 
details and pass them on to the Company and liaise with the FCA  
on your behalf.
• Consider that if you deal with an unauthorised firm, you would  
not be eligible to receive payment under the Financial Services 
Compensation Scheme.
If you suspect you have been approached by fraudsters please contact:
FCA (using the share fraud reporting form):
Website fca.org.uk/scams 
You can also call the FCA Helpline:
Freephone 0800 111 6768 
Within the UK 0300 500 8082
