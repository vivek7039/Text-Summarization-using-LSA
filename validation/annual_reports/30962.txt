Destiny Pharma plc  Annual Report and Financial Statements 2017
01 The successful IPO in September 2017 means 
that Destiny Pharma plc is now well placed to 
develop its novel drug pipeline.
Introduction
I am very pleased as Chairman to 
contribute this introduction to Destiny 
Pharma’s first Annual Report as an AIM 
company. The successful listing in 
September 2017 was clearly a major 
achievement and the concurrent 
fundraising of over £15 million means 
that Destiny Pharma is now very well 
placed to continue to develop much 
needed novel, anti-infective drugs such 
as its lead asset XF-73 and also to 
progress the earlier pipeline.
The listing could not have been 
achieved without the hard work and 
support of Destiny Pharma’s past and 
present Board, shareholders, advisers 
and employees. Destiny Pharma was 
one of only two biotech companies to 
list in London in 2017 and it is a great 
credit to the tenacity of the whole 
Destiny Pharma team, and the 
potential value in the novel drug 
development pipeline, that Destiny 
Pharma secured the listing. At the 
same time, Destiny Pharma signed a 
collaboration with China Medical 
Systems (“CMS”) who became a major 
investor and also a key partner in the 
greater China region. On behalf of 
Destiny Pharma, I welcome CMS as an 
investor and partner and also its Board 
representative, Dr Huaizheng Peng, 
who is a strong addition to the Destiny 
Pharma Board.
Destiny Pharma is now well placed to 
continue the clinical development of 
its lead asset into Phase 2 studies and 
will also look at opportunities to 
collaborate and develop its earlier 
assets. There is clearly a global need 
for new anti-infective drugs that are 
effective and reduce the growing 
danger of antimicrobial resistance 
(“AMR”). Destiny Pharma is committed 
to continue working to address this 
significant market need. 
The Board of Destiny Pharma would 
particularly like to thank the new and 
existing investors who supported the 
IPO funding and continue to support 
Destiny Pharma as a newly quoted 
company. I would also like to thank our 
employees for their ongoing efforts 
to ensure that Destiny Pharma delivers 
its IPO strategy. Together with the 
Board, we are all committed to 
building a valuable drug development 
company. We are looking forward to 
2018 and are confident in the outlook 
for Destiny Pharma plc.
Sir Nigel Rudd
Non-executive Chairman
11 April 2018
Acinetobacter baumannii 
infections have become 
increasingly difficult to treat 
because of the emergence of 
strains that are resistant to 
all drugs.
Chairman’s statement
Destiny Pharma plc  Annual Report and Financial Statements 2017
02 In its infancy, the company predominantly carried out 
contract research for large pharmaceutical companies, 
including Novartis. Between its incorporation and 2003, 
the company worked in three main areas of research:
• novel surfaces to improve hip implantation;
• surface bound photodynamic agents; and
• antimicrobial photodynamic agents.
Destiny Pharma had a major breakthrough in 2003 when 
its innovative research created a new anti-bacterial drug 
platform, the XF drugs. Unlike antibiotics, XF drugs have 
demonstrated the remarkable quality of not generating 
bacterial resistance.
In September 2017, Destiny Pharma was admitted to 
AIM raising over £15 million and also signed a collaboration 
with China Medical Systems who invested a further 
£3 million in December 2017. In February 2018, Destiny 
Pharma announced that it had successfully opened its first 
IND in the USA, has been awarded fast-track status and 
was commencing the planned clinical programme. Phase 2 
studies are on track to start later in 2018 and report data 
in 2019.
Destiny Pharma’s business was 
founded by the current Chief 
Scientific Officer, Dr Bill Love, in 
1997 to identify and generate high 
value pharmaceutical intellectual 
property. It is headquartered at 
the Sussex Innovation Centre at 
The University of Sussex in 
Brighton, UK.

WHO names 
antibiotic 
resistance as 
a top global 
concern
Antibiotic resistant bacteria pose a 
threat to public health and are of 
serious concern to the World Health 
Organization (“WHO”). There is now 
a global imperative to put in place 
initiatives at all levels of society 
(including stewardship, new drug R&D, 
diagnostics in both human and animal 
health) to address antibiotic resistant 
bacteria in a concerted effort to 
counter the prediction of ten million 
deaths (and an estimated $100 trillion 
cost by 2050). This was set out in Lord 
O’Neill’s Independent Review on 
Antimicrobial Resistance (“AMR”), 
published in May 2016.
In September 2016, the United Nations 
announced a recognition of the threat 
from AMR, and the UN, WHO, the US 
Food and Agriculture Organization, 
The World Organisation for Animal 
Health and Organisation for Economic 
Co-operation and Development are all 
planning to recommend actions to 
address this global problem, which will 
be delivered at the 73rd UN General 
Assembly in 2018.
The Hangzhou G20 Leaders’ 
Communiqué, published on 20 May 
2017, recognised the importance of 
reactivating the R&D pipeline through 
incentive mechanisms that avoid 
reliance on high price/volume 
combinations, and called on the WHO, 
FAO, OIE and OECD to collectively 
report back in 2017.
The US Centers for Disease Control 
and Prevention confirm that each year 
in the US at least two million people 
become infected with bacteria that are 
resistant to antibiotics and at least 
23,000 die each year as a direct result 
of such infections.
Bacteria have been shown to evolve 
to resist the new drugs that modern 
medicine uses to combat them. 
Indeed, this was the case with 
penicillin, one of the first antibiotics 
developed almost 100 years ago. 
However, in recent years, the rise in 
AMR has been a particular concern, 
especially with the emergence of many 
different types of superbug.
Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus 
aureus (“MRSA”) is one of the most 
prominent superbugs and a major 
cause of hospital-associated infection 
and featured in the WHO’s ‘most 
dangerous’ list of superbugs published 
in 2017. The WHO followed US and 
European guidelines in 2016 by 
recommending the screening and 
decolonisation of MRSA and all strains 
of Staphylococcus aureus in 
pre-surgical patients undergoing 
high-risk surgeries in a step designed 
to help prevent such infections. This is 
the focus for Destiny Pharma’s lead 
XF-73 programme.
Destiny Pharma is focused on the development of novel medicines 
that represent a new approach to the prevention and treatment 
of life-threatening infections caused by antibiotic resistant 
bacteria, often referred to as superbugs.
The need for new anti-infective drugs
A global imperative
A study in the US in 2010 found that 
infections caused by the superbug 
methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus 
aureus (“MRSA”) were more than twice 
as expensive to treat as infections 
caused by the easier-to-treat 
methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus 
aureus (“MSSA”).

costs and utilization associated with methicillin 
resistance for patients with Staphylococcus aureus 
infection, Infection Control and Hospital 
Epidemiology, 2010, 31 (4).

report and recommendations, May 2016.
Destiny Pharma plc  Annual Report and Financial Statements 2017
04 Tackling AMR is now recognised as 
a high priority at a national and 
global level. With an increasing 
number of hospital-based medical 
procedures being carried out across 
the world, there is a specific need for 
improved patient care regarding 
hospital infections. This should deliver 
both better outcomes for patients 
and a reduction in the increasing 
costs of post-operative care incurred 
by hospitals, governments and 
insurance companies.
Steps are already being taken in this 
direction, particularly in the US, with 
the Generating Antibiotics Incentives 
Now (“GAIN”) Act and 21st Century 
Cures Act. Both of these propose 
incentives to spur development of 
new drugs, (including a more 
streamlined regulatory path) to tackle 
AMR and also the Hospital Acquired 
Condition reduction programme which 
financially penalises the poorest 
performing US hospitals in terms 
of MRSA infection rates.
The drive to tackle AMR is receiving 
global interest and priority with new 
specific sources of ‘pull’ and ‘push’ 
incentives, including funding from IMI, 
Carb-X, GAMRIF and potential pricing 
and reimbursement adjustments or 
market entry rewards to recognise the 
societal value that anti-bacterial drugs 
contribute. Destiny Pharma has a 
strong track record in attracting 
non-dilutive funding from such 
sources, with approximately 
£4.5 million received to date and 
will continue to seek similar 
non-dilutive funding to assist 
in financing its pipeline.
Destiny Pharma’s XF-73 pipeline 
could contribute to addressing the 
cost of antibiotic resistant bacteria, 
and the company has been invited 
to participate in groups that are 
discussing the problem 
and developing solutions.
• The company is represented 
at the Wellcome Trust Global 
AMR Clinical Trials Network 
team, examining potential for 
clinical networks for 
antibacterial drug development, 
alongside the FDA, BARDA, 
EMA, WT, CDC, NIAID and other 
industry leaders in AMR.
• Dr Bill Love was appointed by 
Professor Dame Sally Davies, UK 
Chief Medical Officer, Department 
of Health, to the Expert Advisory 
Board of the Global Anti-Microbial 
Resistance Innovation Fund in 
November 2016.
• The company is also a founder 
member of the BEAM Alliance, 
set up in 2015 and representing 
and promoting the interests 
of more than 40 European 
biotech companies in the area of 
anti-bacterial drug development.
Unless action is taken the O’Neill 
report estimates AMR will cost the world 
an additional ten million lives a year by 
2050, more than the number of people 
currently dying from cancer each year.

Destiny Pharma plc  Annual Report and Financial Statements 2017
05 Infections caused by antibiotic resistant strains of 
bacteria continue to rise at an alarming rate and 
are of serious concern to the WHO. 
Many initiatives to spur the development and approval of new antibiotics/antibacterial drugs 
are under consideration. The US government is particularly active in this area.
Key initiatives in recent years are set out below:
Generating Antibiotic Incentives 
Now (“GAIN”) Act, 2012 (US)
Qualifying Infectious Disease 
Products (“QIDPs”), rapid review by 
FDA and five years of additional US 
market exclusivity.
New Technology Add-on 
Payment (“NTAP”), (US)
New drugs may qualify for NTAP 
status, which when granted can 
reimburse up to 50% of the new 
product cost to US hospitals.
US President’s 2016 Budget, 
January 2015
$1.2 billion proposed to specifically 
tackle antibiotic resistance; 
a doubling of the budget.

United Nations,  
September 2016
The UN recognises the threat from 
AMR and the UN General Assembly 
has, for only the fourth time in its 
history, published a directive on a 
healthcare issue, requesting UN, 
WHO, FAO, OIE and OECD to report 
on actions to address this global 
threat in 2018.
21st Century Cures Act,  
December 2016 (US)
Instructs the FDA to enable approval 
of QIDPs in Limited Patient 
Populations which will allow more 
efficient clinical trial design and 
greater ease of drug approval for 
a limited label population.
G20 Declaration, May 2017
Recognised the importance of 
reactivating the R&D pipeline through 
incentive mechanisms that avoid the 
reliance on high price/volume 
combinations and the need to 
promote prudent and responsible use 
of antimicrobials. In the Hangzhou 
G20 Leaders’ Communiqué, G20 
leaders called on the WHO, FAO, 
OIE and OECD to collectively report 
back in 2017.
Davos announcement, 
February 2018
$1 billion rewards proposed at Davos 
2018 for new antibiotics: the study, 
titled “Revitalizing the Antibiotic 
Pipeline: Stimulating Innovation while 
Driving Sustainable Use and Global 
Access”, was produced by an 
international group made up of 23 
partners from big pharma, academic 
institutions and public health 
organisations. The complementary 
measures laid out in the study cover 
30 incentives on how to drive 
antibiotic innovation. Three primary 
solutions include:
Market entry reward for truly 
innovative antibiotics 
A $1 billion reward per antibiotic 
globally, in addition to sales revenue, 
could quadruple novel antibiotics 
over 30 years.
Maximised antibiotic R&D 
environment
An increase of $300 million, or 
approximately 50%, in government 
grant funding and R&D co-ordinators 
is needed to foster collaboration and 
fundamental research.
Long-term governance
The G20, through its recently 
announced Global R&D Collaboration 
Hub, should implement a focused 
investment strategy and facilitate the 
above two points.
A post-antibiotic era means, in effect, an 
end to modern medicine as we know it. 
Things as common as strep throat or a 
child’s scratched knee could once again kill.

Commercialisation
Whilst Destiny Pharma takes great 
care to assess the needs of the 
clinician in the anti-infectives sector, 
it also investigates the commercial 
markets, looking at potential market 
volumes and also pricing implications. 
The reports produced guide the 
portfolio review and the selection of 
target indications. Destiny Pharma is 
looking to partner later stage 
projects with expert sales and 
marketing pharma or specialty 
pharma companies who can advise 
on the later stage clinical trials and 
carry out product launches and sales 
to maximise value creation. These 
may be territory rather than 
multi-market/global deals. Destiny 
Pharma has already completed 
one regional collaboration with 
China Medical Systems.
Funding
Destiny Pharma has a track record 
of raising funds in both private and 
public markets. The company has 
also won grants and other 
non-dilutive funding awards. Destiny 
Pharma is well funded through to 
2020 and will continue to seek 
non-dilutive funding and partnerships 
that may generate cash income 
and/or bring funding support to 
collaborative projects. If additional 
projects are defined that need 
additional funds, then Destiny 
Pharma can also consider using 
its listed status to attract 
funding support.
Focus
Destiny Pharma is committed to 
developing new drugs that will be a 
significant improvement on current 
anti-infectives and that will be part 
of the global project to address 
AMR. Destiny Pharma does not 
intend to build a sales and marketing 
infrastructure so will keep its focus 
as a “drug development engine” in 
its chosen therapeutic areas. Destiny 
Pharma has already proven it can 
develop intellectual property, 
identify lead candidates and bring 
selected compounds through early 
testing to be ready for late stage 
Phase 2b clinical trials.
Collaborations
Destiny Pharma owns the XF 
platform but is committed to reach 
out and work with sector specialists 
at all stages of the drug research and 
clinical development process if such 
collaborations will advance projects 
and deliver shareholder value. These 
could include university research 
partnerships, formulation 
development or projects examining 
XF drugs’ interaction with other 
anti-infectives or potentiation 
mechanisms. Destiny Pharma is well 
connected with expert groups across 
the world and will continue to explore 
such opportunities.

Financial statements Governance Strategic report
Destiny Pharma plc  Annual Report and Financial Statements 2017
09 Destiny Pharma’s strategic aim is to become 
one of the world’s leading developers of novel 
anti-infective drugs.
The Board is committed to progressing 
the Destiny Pharma pipeline with the 
goal of delivering better drug 
treatments for patients and creating 
significant value for shareholders. 
The company is part of a network of 
biotech and pharma companies 
working in this sector and will continue 
to consider partnerships and licensing 
opportunities where appropriate.
Destiny Pharma plans to generate 
income and shareholder value by the 
clinical development and commercial 
exploitation of its proprietary, highly 
innovative anti-bacterial drug platform; 
the XF drug series. The XF drug 
platform is being developed to prevent 
and treat existing and emerging 
superbug infections within and outside 
of hospitals. 
The company’s intellectual property is 
already well established with 94 granted 
and three pending patents within three 
patent families, covering composition of 
matter, novel mechanism of action and 
bacterial biofilm action. The company 
has plans to develop and commercialise 
its pipeline.
Therefore, while Destiny Pharma’s 
strategy is to develop robust 
clinical packages around its drug 
candidates that make them 
attractive to pharmaceutical 
companies to license, the company 
believes it can potentially continue 
to build value through conducting 
late stage clinical development itself, 
ensuring a licensing deal need only 
be struck at the right time and on 
optimal terms for its shareholders.
Additionally, while the market for the 
lead asset XF-73 is initially in the US, 
the need for such a new treatment is 
global and Destiny Pharma also has 
the ability to enter into licensing 
agreements and collaborations for 
other territories in due course. For 
example, the agreement with CMS is 
a broad collaboration to develop the 
company’s assets in the China/Asia 
market. The company will also look to 
enter selected partnership to develop 
its earlier stage assets and apply for 
non-dilutive sources of grant and 
governmental funding, as it has done in 
the past, to assist in the development 
of its portfolio.
The Board believes that the increasing 
governmental pressure and financial 
incentives that are being implemented 
now and possibly in the future by 
leading institutions such as the WHO, 
UN, FDA and G7/G20 will increase 
further the options available for 
profitable commercialisation and 
the generation of shareholder value.

killing bacteria in vitro in less than 
15 minutes; faster acting than standard 
antibiotics currently in use.
Ability to kill bacteria in any 
growth phase
This is an important feature as bacteria 
are not always actively growing. 
XF drugs are able to kill bacteria even 
when dormant.
Ability to kill bacteria within 
staphylococcal bacterial biofilms
Biofilms are an increasing problem that 
are poorly treated by current drugs as 
they act as a protective barrier for 
bacteria. They are associated with 
indwelling medical devices (for example, 
heart valves and joint replacements) and 
invasive medical devices (for example, 
catheters and endoscopes).
Active against all gram-positive 
bacteria tested to date and 
selected gram-negative bacteria
This includes clinically important and 
infection-causing strains, such as:
• Staphylococcus aureus; 
• Listeria monocytogenes;
• Propionibacterium acnes;
• Group G Streptococcus;
• Mycobacterium tuberculosis;
• Streptococcus pneumonia;
• Bacillus anthracis;
• Yersinia pestis;
• Acinetobacter baumannii;
• Pseudomonas aeruginosa; and
• Clostridium difficile.
All existing antibiotic resistant strains 
of gram-positive bacteria tested to 
date are susceptible to XF drugs, 
including MRSA.
No bacterial (MRSA)  
resistance is seen to emerge
No bacterial (MRSA) resistance was 
seen to emerge in a landmark in vitro 
study of bacterial resistance that 
compared XF-73 to standard antibiotics 
currently in use. The bacteria (MRSA) 
did not demonstrate any resistance to 
XF-73 even after 55 repeat exposures 
(being the longest repeat exposure 
study published as far as the company 
is aware). In contrast, MRSA rapidly 
developed significant resistance to a 
range of antibiotics tested. A second 
study using clinical bacterial samples 
from a clinical trial of XF-73 provided 
the first clinical data supporting the 
same “no resistance profile”.
The XF drugs can therefore potentially 
operate within existing antibiotic 
markets and may also be able to 
open new preventative and therapeutic 
drug markets that are closed to, or 
restricted for, traditional antibiotics 
because of the existence and/or 
threat of AMR. This threat means that 
antibiotics have to be used sparingly 
to limit the development of 
bacterial resistance.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa 
can be deadly for patients in 
critical care. An estimated 
51,000 healthcare-associated 
infections are caused by this 
bacteria in the United States 
each year.
Clinical data from 
the XF-73 nasal 
programme is strong
Following a review of clinical trial data 
on XF-73 (exeporfinium chloride), it was 
awarded Qualifying Infectious Disease 
Product (“QIDP”) status in October 
2015 by the FDA. Within the QIDP 
award, the FDA also confirmed a new 
US disease indication for XF-73; namely 
the “prevention of post-surgical 
staphylococcal infections”, including 
MRSA. This represents a new US 
market for which no existing product is 
approved. QIDP status identifies XF-73 
as a drug that is intended to treat 
serious or life-threatening infections, 
including those caused by antibiotic 
resistant pathogens.
Destiny Pharma has completed five 
successful Phase 1/2a clinical trials 
with XF-73. The most recent trial was 
conducted in the US and was funded 
by the US government’s expert 
division on antimicrobial drugs, the 
National Institute for Allergy and 
Infectious Diseases (“NIAID”), who 
reported the successful outcome from 
this trial in September 2016.
In Europe and the US, the company 
has completed five successful Phase 1 
studies. These trials, in addition to the 
latest US trial, have provided the 
following data supporting an attractive 
new product profile for XF-73.
The recent US study shows the 
potential of XF-73:
• appropriate clinical safety profile;
• well tolerated at multiple doses;
• no drug exposure in the 
bloodstream;
• rapid, anti-staphylococcal action 
in the nose; and
• antibacterial efficacy statistically 
demonstrated over placebo.

Destiny Pharma plc  Annual Report and Financial Statements 2017
13 The medical need to combat 
surgical infections is significant 
Patient carriage of Staphylococcus 
aureus strains, including MRSA, is 
recognised as a growing problem 
and the testing of patients entering 
hospital for surgery is widespread in 
many countries, including the US. 
Landmark outcome studies (Bode et 
al 2010) have demonstrated that 
reduction of all strains of 
Staphylococcus aureus can 
significantly reduce the post-surgical 
infection rate by 60% and reduce 
mortality.
In response to these and other 
findings, in February 2013, the US 
Surgical Infection Society (“SIS”), the 
Society for Hospital Epidemiologists 
of America (“SHEA”), the Infectious 
Disease Society of America (“IDSA”) 
and the American Society of Hospital 
Pharmacists (“ASHP”) published new 
guidelines recommending that in the 
US all Staphylococcus aureus 
(including MRSA) should be 
decolonised in all cardiovascular and 
most orthopaedic surgeries. This 
represents a five to tenfold increase 
in the market size for Staphylococcus 
aureus decolonisation in the US.
In 2014, AHRQ/IDSA/SHEA 
recommended an even more 
aggressive treatment strategy, 
Universal Decolonisation (“UD”) of all 
intensive care unit (“ICU”) patients 
without screening, awarding a Grade I 
(highest) level of evidence rating. 
US hospital groups, including the 
Hospital Corporation of America, are 
now implementing UD for all patients 
entering the ICU. This market has a 
potential patient population of over 
eight million people in the US alone. 
UD of ICU patients represents a 
potentially attractive line extension 
for XF-73 where its rapid anti-bacterial 
action and attractive resistance profile 
could enable this preventative measure 
into the future.
In Europe, similar guidelines exist 
recommending decolonisation of 
Staphylococcus aureus positive 
patients prior to certain surgeries. 
The antibiotic, mupirocin, is often 
used off-label in the US for these 
applications, although it has two key 
disadvantages in that it is slow acting, 
requiring five days of dosing, and 
staphylococcal resistance to mupirocin 
can develop rapidly and become 
widespread. Consequently, many 
guidelines are accompanied with a 
resistance warning related to 
mupirocin use.
In 2016, the WHO published its Global 
Guidelines for the Prevention of 
Surgical Site Infection, which now 
too recommend the screening and 
decolonisation of all Staphylococcus 
aureus strains pre-surgery in high 
risk surgeries.
It is therefore apparent that there 
has been a move from screening 
and treatment of just MRSA carriage 
in patient populations to also now 
include all Staphylococcus aureus 
strains (MRSA and MSSA), an 
approximate five to tenfold 
increase in the number of patients 
who can benefit.

14 The commercial opportunity  
for XF-73 is over a billion dollars
There is a significant market for a new 
drug that can assist in the “prevention 
of post-surgical staphylococcal 
infections”, particularly in the US. 
There are approximately 40 million 
surgeries per year in the US alone, all 
of which expose patients to the risk of 
post-surgical infections. Of these 
patients, Destiny Pharma estimates 
that 14 million are at a higher risk of 
infection as a result of the nature of 
their surgery and the environment in 
which they are treated. These 
estimates are based on a variety of 
sources including the Office of 
National Statistics (“ONS”), National 
Health Service (“NHS”) data and 
various medical articles and journals. 
Therefore, including the potential 
future use of XF-73 within the ICU 
the company believes markets totalling 
at least 20 million patients per annum 
exist in the US alone.
The market analysis undertaken by 
Destiny Pharma and its specialist 
consultants supports the view that 
XF-73 could achieve annual peak sales 
in the US alone of over $1 billion and 
peak sales in Europe and the Rest of 
the World could be $500 million for 
the initial indication of “prevention of 
post-surgical staphylococcal 
infections” alone.
Destiny Pharma has undertaken 
independent market research of the 
product profile of XF-73. This study 
reported that the sample of 66 US and 
EU treaters (surgeons, infectious 
disease specialists and ICU specialists) 
and payers (hospital medical directors, 
pharmacy services directors, 
microbiologists and clinical directors) 
who were consulted, confirmed that 
XF-73’s target product profile is 
superior when compared to mupirocin, 
with the potential to replace mupirocin 
as the preferred treatment.
Destiny Pharma believes that there 
is significant demand for the XF-73 
product and have identified the 
following additional drivers for adoption:
• current practice guidelines have 
identified patient populations that 
can benefit while highlighting that 
antibiotic resistance as an issue with 
current products;
• from 2017, US general, acute-care 
and short-term hospitals with 
the highest MRSA infections 
will have 1% of their Medicare 
reimbursements withheld;
• on 20 September 2016, the UN 
General Assembly called for new 
drugs to tackle antibiotic resistance;
• US hospital administrators are keen 
to reduce infection to ensure high 
ratings in rankings tables;
• XF-73, having QIDP approval, 
benefits from five years of extra US 
market exclusivity;
• XF-73 could be the first drug 
approved into a new US indication 
with first to market advantages; and
• XF-73 has both QIDP and Fast Track 
regulatory status in the US.
As XF-73 is differentiated from 
antibiotics due to its superior bacterial 
resistance profile, it is likely that its use 
can be widespread, preserving antibiotic 
use and could potentially be used 
without the need for bacterial screening. 
In this aspect, XF-73 can be viewed as 
a preventative pharmaceutical more 
akin to vaccines than antibiotics.
XF-73 has the opportunity to become 
the first drug approved in the US for 
the new indication “prevention of 
post-surgical staphylococcal 
infections” and will only need to be 
compared to placebo at Phase 2b and 3 
(as no comparator exists) and could 
become the benchmark against which 
all future would-be competitors will be 
measured. This is a major attribute and 
will help drive the clinical programme 
and also the commercialisation of 
XF-73 in the US.
Global peak 
annual sales 
of XF-73 are 
projected at 
around 
$1.5 billion

15 Destiny Pharma plans to continue to 
develop XF-73 for the prevention of 
Staphylococcus aureus VAP. The use 
of an XF-73 oral cavity/throat 
treatment to prevent VAP, together 
with the potential for use of the 
product as an adjunct to nasal 
treatment in mechanically ventilated 
patients is an attractive opportunity.
XF-70 for the treatment of 
antibiotic resistant gram positive 
and gram negative bacterial burn 
wound infections
In 2016 the global topical antibacterial 
market was estimated at $6 billion.
Destiny Pharma has a strong 
pre-clinical, in vitro and in vivo, 
infection model data set which 
demonstrates the efficacy of topically 
applied XF drugs against gram positive 
and gram negative bacteria, including 
MRSA, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and 
Acinetobacter baumannii. In some 
cases, unformulated XF drugs have 
been shown to be as active as existing, 
marketed antibiotics. 
Destiny Pharma plans to develop 
XF-70 towards a therapeutic dermal 
infection indication, and will deliver 
a pre-clinical data pack that could 
support a wide range of indications 
including impetigo, acne, atopic 
dermatitis, bacterial infected skin 
lacerations, candida skin/vaginal 
infection and treatment of serious 
bacterial burn wound infections.
The company already has data 
supporting the efficacy in serious 
bacterial burn wound infection models 
in studies conducted in association 
with the US Department of Defense.
Biofilm product opportunities
Destiny Pharma was granted a US 
biofilm patent on 3 May 2016 and will 
seek to develop and exploit product 
opportunities including research 
collaborations based around this 
emerging market. XF-73 and XF-70 
have shown the ability to act against 
Staphylococcus aureus within formed 
biofilms which are protective against 
traditional antibiotics. 
Bacterial biofilms are implicated in 
chronic and recurring infections and 
there is a growing understanding of 
their role and the value in developing 
treatments that can address this issue 
in tissue and medical device related 
infections. For example, bacterial 
biofilm is implicated in chronic lung 
infection in conditions such as cystic 
fibrosis where Staphylococcus aureus, 
including MRSA and Pseudomonas 
aeruginosa are the most common 
pathogens in this condition.
Results already gained from early 
stage research have also identified 
product opportunities in Clostridium 
difficile and Pseudomonas aeruginosa 
infections and bio-threat pathogens 
including anthrax, anthrax spores and 
plague from joint studies with the 
Defence Science and Technology 
Laboratory and the US Department of 
Defense. This is an area of high priority 
for the US government with the 
ongoing threat from bioterrorism.
CEO’s operational and strategic review continued
Exciting earlier pipeline of anti-infective programmes
Several additional projects have been identified for the XF platform
Destiny Pharma plans in the next 
two years to develop two additional 
products from its pipeline towards 
clinical development, and to conduct 
earlier stage research work in respect 
of biofilm action.
XF-73 for the prevention of 
staphylococcal pneumonia in 
hospital patients
There is a growing understanding of 
the link between patient carriage of 
Staphylococcus aureus with the risk 
of Staphylococcus aureus 
ventilator-associated pneumonia 
(“VAP”). Hospital acquired pneumonia 
(“HAP”) is a pulmonary infection that 
develops in patients hospitalised for 
more than 48 hours, either in the ICU 
or in other hospital wards. VAP is a 
subset of HAP that occurs in 
mechanically ventilated patients more 
than 48 hours after tracheal intubation. 
VAP accounts for approximately 90%. 
of ICU HAP and afflicts up to 20% of 
ICU patients who receive mechanical 
ventilation.
The crude in-hospital mortality rate of 
patients with Staphylococcus aureus 
infection with MRSA and MSSA are 
similar, between 29% and 36%, while 
costs for MRSA VAP are on average 
$40,734 per patient and the costs for 
MSSA VAP are $36,523 per patient.
Staphylococcus aureus is the leading 
cause of VAP in Europe and ranks 
alongside Pseudomonas aeruginosa 
as the greatest cause of VAP in US 
hospitals. There are over 1.7 million 
mechanically ventilated patients in the 
US each year who could benefit from 
preventative treatment. There are up 
to 300,000 VAPs per annum in the US 
which cost up to $1.5 billion each year 
to treat.
• A biofilm is an extra-cellular 
matrix of exo-polysaccharides, 
which bacteria form when in 
contact with a host tissue or 
indwelling medical device.
• Biofilms are notoriously resistant 
to antibiotic therapy; they form 
an impenetrable barrier to 
antibiotics.
• Slower growth rate of bacteria 
in biofilms is fundamental to 
antibiotic resistance.

16 Outlook
The funds raised at the IPO will 
provide Destiny Pharma with the 
capital to develop its lead drug asset 
XF-73 through the proposed US 
clinical Phase 2b programme 
delivering a robust package for 
partnering and/or further 
development into Phase 3, which is 
the final stage of clinical development. 
The funds raised will also be used to 
develop new clinical candidates from 
its focused, pre-clinical pipeline and to 
capitalise on the commercial 
opportunities including partnering 
and licensing.
In the Board’s opinion, XF-73 has 
the potential to break the commercial 
paradigm which besets antibiotics. 
Its ‘no resistance’ characteristic 
enables widespread use (unlike 
antibiotics where use is restricted 
due to the fear of AMR). As about 
a third of the population carry the 
infection-causing bacteria 
Staphylococcus aureus 
asymptomatically, and XF-73 is 
designed to kill these bacteria in the 
patient ahead of surgery (preventing 
post-surgical infection), a large new 
market exists. The new indication has 
been recognised by the FDA through 
the QIDP status award.
Destiny Pharma believes that XF-73’s 
preventative disease indication is 
similar to a vaccine approach and 
could lead to the majority of patients 
being treated prior to surgery. There 
are a number of drivers for the 
adoption of this approach, including 
new guidelines and financial penalties 
for US hospitals with high MRSA 
infection rates.
Additional assets from the XF drug 
platform will also be progressed in the 
areas of prevention and treatments for 
staphylococcal pneumonia, serious 
bacterial burn wound infections and 
bacterial biofilm associated infections. 
Destiny Pharma will also establish a 
number of discovery stage research 
programmes through collaborations 
and where possible seek non-dilutive 
funding support.
Following the IPO and the completion 
of our CMS collaboration agreement, 
the outlook for Destiny Pharma is 
strong and our team is committed 
to delivering our strategy and 
building value.
Destiny Pharma has generated 
preliminary data on the potential 
for XF drugs to enhance existing 
antibiotic activity by co-administration 
and plans to extend these studies 
through research collaborations to 
determine if important antibiotic life 
can be reinvigorated and bacterial 
resistance combated.
The company also plans to extend 
studies of the XF drug mechanism 
of action, which may result in further 
optimisation and the ability to target 
microbial pathogens beyond bacteria 
and deliver new intellectual property.
The Directors are keen to explore the 
possibility for accelerating progress on 
some of these earlier programmes by 
entering into strategic co-development 
partnerships with sector experts. 
Concurrently, Destiny Pharma will 
continue to apply for non-dilutive 
funding grants when suitable structures 
are available. It is also the company’s 
intention to apply for US QIDP status 
for its other pipeline programmes.

17 The financial statements are presented 
for the year ended 31 December 2017.
In January 2017, shareholders 
approved a series of corporate 
measures in preparation for the 
planned admission of the company 
to AIM. This included a bonus issue 
of shares from the share premium 
account, whereby 499 new ordinary 
shares were issued for each ordinary 
share held (effectively multiplying the 
number of shares in issue by 500 
and dividing the value of each by 
500). The balance sheet was then 
restructured to enable Destiny Pharma 
to re-register as a public limited 
company, a necessary precursor to 
flotation, by capitalising the remaining 
share premium account into retained 
earnings. Destiny Pharma re-registered 
as a public limited company in 
August 2017.
In September 2017, the company raised 
gross proceeds of £15.3 million in a 
placing with institutional and other 
investors, and on 4 September 2017, 
the company’s share capital was 
admitted to trading on the AIM market 
of the London Stock Exchange, under 
the ticker DEST.
The company raised a further 
£3.0 million in December 2017, at 
the time of entering into a regional

18 Revenue
Destiny Pharma is a clinical stage 
research and development company, 
and did not generate any revenue 
during the period.
Administrative expenses
Administrative expenses, which excludes 
the share-based payments charge of 
£0.7 million (2016: £0.2 million), during 
the period amounted to £2.5 million 
(2016: £1.2 million). 
This includes £0.5 million (2016: £nil) 
of one-off costs relating to the AIM 
flotation that have been taken 
through the statement of 
comprehensive income, rather 
than offset against share premium. 
R&D costs totalling £0.8 million 
(2016: £0.9 million) reflect the 
relatively light scientific and clinical 
programme during the first eight 
months of the year. The R&D costs 
did begin to increase in the last four 
months of 2018 following the AIM 
flotation as the company started 
preparing for the increased activity 
planned in 2018.
Taxation
The company’s research and 
development activities are eligible 
for the UK research and development 
small or medium-sized enterprise 
(“R&D tax credit”) scheme, which 
provides additional taxation relief for 
qualifying expenditure on R&D 
activities, with an option to surrender 
a portion of tax losses arising from 
qualifying activities in return for a cash 
payment from HM Revenue & Customs 
(“HMRC”). The company received a 
repayment of £0.2 million in respect of 
the R&D tax credit claimed in respect 
of the year ended 31 December 2016, 
and the R&D tax credit receivable in the 
balance sheet of £0.2 million is an 
estimate of the cash repayment the 
company expects to qualify for in 
respect of activities during the year 
ended 31 December 2017. However, as 
at the date of this report these amounts 
have not yet been agreed with HMRC.
Loss per share
Basic and diluted loss per share for the 
year was 8.4 pence (2016: 4.0 pence).
Cash, cash equivalents 
and term deposits
The company’s cash, cash equivalents 
and term deposits at the year end 
totalled £16.7 million (2016: £1.5 million).
The net cash outflow from operating 
activities in 2017 was £2.2 million 
against an operating loss of 
£3.2 million, with the major reconciling 
items being the non-cash charge for 
share-based payments of £0.7 million, 
the R&D credit received of £0.2 million 
and other net movements in working 
capital of £0.1 million.
Outlook
The Board believes the company 
is well funded to execute on its 
business strategy and to progress 
its lead and follow-on programmes 
in 2018 and 2019.
Financial statements Governance Strategic report
Destiny Pharma plc  Annual Report and Financial Statements 2017
19 Destiny Pharma’s business is subject to a number 
of risks and uncertainties in common with other 
biotechnology companies operating in the field 
of drug research and development. 
Risk category Description
COMMERCIAL
 
C
Commercial risks which may have an impact on the company’s ability to 
commercialise its products and deliver value to shareholders.
OPERATIONAL
 
O
Operational risks which may impact on the company’s ability to deliver 
on its objectives.
FINANCIAL
 
F
Financial risks which may impact on the sustainability or liquidity of the 
company – affected by internal or external risks.
Principal risk Category Mitigation
Technical, clinical or regulatory milestones may not 
be delivered successfully, leading to delays, 
changes or the abandonment of development 
programmes. There may also be changes in the 
regulatory environment that can impact the 
approval of clinical trials and product filings.
O
These are inherent risks in drug development. 
To mitigate the risks the Scientific Advisory Board, 
expert consultants and management will regularly 
review project progress, industry guidelines and 
manage any issues. The company also works with 
expert regulatory consultants to monitor the latest 
regulations and planned changes to the regulatory 
environment.
Clinical studies may not give the expected results, 
leading to a requirement to run additional clinical 
trials (at additional, unexpected cost), or 
programmes being delayed or abandoned.
O
The company plans to develop a range of products to 
reduce reliance on its lead asset. Clinical trials are 
designed to ensure that meaningful and relevant data 
is produced. Trials are closely monitored to manage 
timelines and cash requirements.
Inability to raise sufficient capital when needed 
may lead to delays, reduction or abandoning 
development programmes.
F
The AIM flotation in September 2017 provides a good 
cash runway through to 2020. The Board has put in place 
investor relations and partnering strategies that should 
support future cash requirements. The virtual business 
model maintains a low overhead base which allows some 
flexibility in managing spending commitments.
Destiny Pharma may not be able to enter into 
partnering relationships for the commercialisation 
of its drug pipeline assets.
C
A partnering strategy is in place to locate potential 
partners. The relationship with China Medical Systems 
represents the first such relationship. Other partnering 
activities are planned to enable Destiny Pharma to 
complete the right deal at the right time to deliver 
shareholder value.
The Board manages such risks by 
maintaining a risk register which 
identifies risks, prioritises them by 
likelihood and impact, and records 
the actions needed to mitigate and 
monitor those risks. 
The Board is also prepared to act 
swiftly to formulate contingency plans 
to manage the situation if any risk 
materialises. 
Key risks are monitored by senior 
management on an ongoing basis 
and the risk register is reviewed 
regularly at Board meetings.
Risks and uncertainties
The principal risks and uncertainties identified by Destiny Pharma in the year ended 31 December 2017 are set out below:
Destiny Pharma plc  Annual Report and Financial Statements 2017
20 Principal risk Category Mitigation
Destiny Pharma’s products may not generate 
market acceptance from the purchasers and 
decision makers who are the eventual users 
and buyers of the products.
C
Destiny Pharma conducts commercial market analysis 
to ensure that development activities are directed 
towards viable markets. Destiny Pharma also has a 
network of key opinion leaders who assist with this 
ongoing review.
The lack of an independent review of the research 
and development programmes to assess the 
positioning and potential of Destiny Pharma’s 
pipelines could lead to the company funding 
projects with limited potential for value creation.
O
A Scientific Advisory Board is being assembled to 
review all proposed projects. External key opinion 
leaders are regularly consulted. Independent market 
appraisals for products are conducted to ensure there 
is a market need.
Dependence on key personnel, the loss of whom 
through departure, ill health or death, may cause 
delays in delivering company strategy.
O
The Board is working to ensure that there is no single 
point of failure, and that the team has some capacity 
to provide resilience in such an eventuality.
If Destiny Pharma is unable to obtain or maintain 
patent protection for its technology and products, 
or if the scope of the patent protection is not 
sufficiently broad, competitors could develop and 
commercialise similar technology and products 
which would materially affect the company’s ability 
to successfully commercialise its technology and 
products. Destiny is exposed to additional 
intellectual property risks, including infringement of 
intellectual property rights, involvement in lawsuits 
and the inability to protect the confidentiality of its 
trade secrets which could have an adverse effect on 
the success of the company.
O
Destiny works with expert intellectual property agents 
to ensure that the patent portfolio is managed to the 
highest standards. This includes developing new IP, 
reviewing any potential competing IP and meeting 
regularly to discuss a longer-term IP strategy.

approved by the Board and signed

Destiny Pharma plc  Annual Report and Financial Statements 2017
21 Introduction to  
Corporate Governance
As the company is listed on the AIM 
market of the London Stock Exchange, 
it is not required to comply with the 
provisions of the UK Corporate 
Governance Code (the “Code”). 
However, the Board is committed 
to high standards of corporate 
governance and seeks to apply best 
practice, as exemplified by the QCA 
Guidelines, to the extent that it is 
appropriate for a company of Destiny 
Pharma’s size and complexity.
Board of Directors
The Board is responsible for the 
direction and overall performance of 
the company with emphasis on policy 
and strategy, financial results and 
major operational issues. 
During the year, the Board comprised 
the Chief Executive Officer, Chief 
Scientific Officer and Chief Financial 
Officer as Executive Directors and the 
Non-executive Chairman, and at least 
two other Non-executive Directors 
who are independent of management 
(a full list of the Directors who served 
during the year is set out in the 
Directors’ report on page 28 of this 
Annual Report.)
Appropriate Directors’ and officers’ 
liability insurance has been arranged 
by the company.
Meetings of the  
Board of Directors
The Board meets at least six times 
a year, after all relevant information 
has been circulated in good time, 
to discuss a formal scheduled agenda 
covering key areas of the company’s 
affairs including research and 
development, strategy, and operational 
and financial performance.
All members of the Board are 
expected to attend Board meetings, 
which are scheduled in advance. 
Following admission to AIM, all 
Directors have attended all Board and 
Committee meetings that they were 
eligible to attend.
Audit Committee
The Audit Committee was constituted 
on 4 September 2017 on admission to 
AIM, and since then has comprised 
Peter Morgan (chair), Joe Eagle and 
Sir Nigel Rudd.
The Audit Committee, which meets 
at least twice a year, is responsible for 
keeping under review the scope and 
results of the audit, its cost 
effectiveness and the independence 
and objectivity of the auditor. Due 
to the size of the company, there is 
currently no internal audit function, 
although the Audit Committee has 
oversight responsibility for public 
reporting, overall good governance 
and the company’s internal controls. 
Other members of the Board, as well 
as the auditor, are invited to attend the 
Audit Committee meetings as and 
when appropriate, and the Chair of the 
Committee also has a direct line of 
communication with the auditor.
The Directors support high standards of corporate 
governance and have established a set of corporate 
governance principles which they regard as appropriate 
for the stage of development of the company.

admission to AIM, and since then has 
comprised Joe Eagle (Chair), Sir Nigel 
Rudd and Peter Morgan.
The Remuneration Committee, 
which meets at least twice a year, 
is responsible for considering the 
remuneration packages for Executive 
Directors and the bonus and share 
option strategy for the company 
and making recommendations as 
appropriate. The Remuneration 
Committee works within the 
framework of a compensation 
policy approved by the Board.
The Remuneration Committee is 
also responsible for reviewing the 
performance of the Executive 
Directors and ensuring that they are 
fairly and responsibly rewarded for 
their individual contributions to the 
company’s overall performance. 
The Committee’s scope extends to 
all remuneration of Directors including 
bonus and share options.
None of the Committee members 
has any day-to-day responsibility for 
running the company and no Director 
participates in discussions about his 
own remuneration.
Nomination Committee
The Nomination Committee was 
constituted on 4 September 2017 on 
admission to AIM, and since then has 
comprised Sir Nigel Rudd (Chair), 
Peter Morgan and Joe Eagle.
The Nomination Committee meets 
at least twice a year, is responsible 
for considering the composition and 
efficacy of the Board as a whole, 
and for making recommendations 
as appropriate. During the year, the 
Nomination Committee approved the 
appointment of Dr Huaizheng Peng to 
the Board.
UK Bribery Act 2010
The Board has established a bribery 
policy to achieve compliance with the 
UK Bribery Act 2010, which came into 
effect on 1 July 2011. A training 
programme is in place for all Directors, 
staff and contractors. Agreements with 
third parties contain statements that 
the company and its associates are 
required to adhere at all times to the 
UK Bribery Act 2010.
Internal control
The Board is responsible for the 
effectiveness of the company’s internal 
control system and is supplied with 
information to enable it to discharge 
its duties. Internal control systems are 
designed to meet the particular needs 
of the company and to manage rather 
than eliminate the risk of failure to 
meet business objectives and can only 
provide reasonable and not absolute 
assurance against material 
misstatement or loss.

Destiny Pharma plc  Annual Report and Financial Statements 2017
28 Statement of Directors’ responsibilities
The Directors are responsible for 
preparing the Annual Report and the 
Financial Statements in accordance 
with applicable law and regulations.
Company law requires the Directors to 
prepare financial statements for each 
financial year. Under that law, the 
Directors have elected to prepare the 
financial statements in accordance 
with International Financial Reporting 
Standards (“IFRSs”) as adopted by the 
EU and applicable law.
Under company law, the Directors 
must not approve the financial 
statements unless they are satisfied 
that they give a true and fair view of 
the state of affairs of the company and 
of the profit or loss of the company for 
that period. In preparing these 
financial statements, the Directors 
are required to:
• select suitable accounting policies 
and then apply them consistently;
• make judgements and accounting 
estimates that are reasonable and 
prudent;
• state whether applicable accounting 
standards have been followed, 
subject to any material departures 
disclosed and explained in the 
financial statements; and
• prepare the financial statements on 
the going concern basis unless it is 
inappropriate to presume that the 
company will continue in business.
The Directors are responsible for 
keeping adequate accounting records 
that are sufficient to show and explain 
the company’s transactions and 
disclose with reasonable accuracy at 
any time the financial position of the 
company and enable them to ensure 
that the financial statements comply 
with the Companies Act 2006. They 
are also responsible for safeguarding 
the assets of the company and hence 
for taking reasonable steps for the 
prevention and detection of fraud 
and other irregularities.
They are further responsible for 
ensuring that the strategic report 
and Directors’ report, and other 
information included in the Annual 
Report and Financial Statements are 
prepared in accordance with 
applicable law in the United Kingdom.
The maintenance and integrity of the 
Destiny Pharma plc website is the 
responsibility of the Directors; the 
work carried out by the auditor does 
not involve the consideration of these 
matters and, accordingly, the auditor 
accepts no responsibility for any 
changes that may have occurred in 
the accounts since they were initially 
presented on the website. 
Legislation in the United Kingdom 
governing the preparation and 
dissemination of the accounts and the 
other information included in annual 
reports may differ from legislation in 
other jurisdictions.

Destiny Pharma plc  Annual Report and Financial Statements 2017 Independent auditor’s report
to the shareholders of Destiny Pharma plc
Opinion
We have audited the financial 
statements of Destiny Pharma plc 
for the year ended 31 December 2017, 
which comprise:
• the statement of comprehensive 
income for the year ended 
31 December 2017;
• the statement of financial position 
as at 31 December 2017;
• the statement of cash flows and 
statement of changes in equity for 
the year ended 31 December 2017; 
and
• the notes to the financial 
statements, which include a 
summary of significant accounting 
policies and other explanatory 
information.
The financial reporting framework that 
has been applied in the preparation of 
the company financial statements is 
applicable law and International 
Financial Reporting Standards 
(“IFRSs”) as adopted by the 
European Union. 
In our opinion the financial statements:
• give a true and fair view of the 
state of the company’s affairs as 
at 31 December 2017 and of the 
company’s loss for the period 
then ended;
• have been properly prepared in 
accordance with International 
Financial Reporting Standards as 
adopted by the European Union; 
and
• the financial statements have been 
prepared in accordance with the 
requirements of the Companies 
Act 2006. 
Basis for opinion 
We conducted our audit in accordance 
with International Standards on 
Auditing (UK) (“ISAs (UK)”) and 
applicable law. Our responsibilities 
under those standards are further 
described in the auditor’s 
responsibilities for the audit of the 
financial statements section of our 
report. We are independent of the 
company in accordance with the 
ethical requirements that are relevant 
to our audit of the financial statements 
in the UK, including the FRC’s Ethical 
Standard, and we have fulfilled our 
other ethical responsibilities in 
accordance with these requirements. 
We believe that the audit evidence 
we have obtained is sufficient and 
appropriate to provide a basis for 
our opinion.
Conclusions relating  
to going concern
We have nothing to report in respect 
of the following matters in relation to 
which ISAs (UK) require us to report 
to you when:
• the Directors’ use of the going 
concern basis of accounting in 
the preparation of the financial 
statements is not appropriate; or
• the Directors have not disclosed 
in the financial statements any 
identified material uncertainties 
that may cast significant doubt 
about the company’s ability to 
continue to adopt the going 
concern basis of accounting for 
a period of at least twelve months 
from the date when the financial 
statements are authorised for issue. 
Overview of our audit approach
Materiality
In planning and performing our audit 
we applied the concept of materiality. 
An item is considered material if it 
could reasonably be expected to 
change the economic decisions of a 
user of the financial statements. We 
used the concept of materiality to both 
focus our testing and to evaluate the 
impact of misstatements identified.
Based on our professional judgement, 
we determined overall materiality for 
the company financial statements as 
a whole to be £84,000, based on 5% 
of normalised loss before tax. 
We use a different level of materiality 
(‘performance materiality’) to 
determine the extent of our testing for 
the audit of the financial statements. 
Performance materiality is set based 
on the audit materiality as adjusted for 
the judgements made as to the entity 
risk and our evaluation of the specific 
risk of each audit area having regard 
to the internal control environment. 
Where considered appropriate 
performance materiality may be 
reduced to a lower level, such as, 
for related party transactions and 
Directors’ remuneration.
We agreed with the Audit Committee 
to report to it all identified errors in 
excess of £5,000. Errors below that 
threshold would also be reported to it 
if, in our opinion as auditor, disclosure 
was required on qualitative grounds.
Overview of the scope of our audit
The company’s operations are based 
in the UK at a one central operating 
location. The audit team visited this 
location and performed a full scope 
audit on the company.
Key audit matters
Key audit matters are those matters 
that, in our professional judgement, 
were of most significance in our audit 
of the financial statements of the 
current period and include the most 
significant assessed risks of material 
misstatement (whether or not due to 
fraud) that we identified. These 
matters included those which had the 
greatest effect on: the overall audit 
strategy; the allocation of resources in 
the audit; and directing the efforts of 
the engagement team. These matters 
were addressed in the context of our 
audit of the financial statements as a 
whole, and in forming our opinion 
thereon, and we do not provide a 
separate opinion on these matters.
This is not a complete list of all risks 
identified by our audit.
Our audit procedures in relation to 
these matters were designed in the 
context of our audit opinion as a 
whole. They were not designed to 
enable us to express an opinion on 
these matters individually and we 
express no such opinion.
Key audit matter
Allocation of admission costs 
between equity and statement 
of comprehensive income
The company incurred costs of 
approximately £1.37 million in 
connection with its placing and 
admission to AIM.
The allocation of admission costs 
between equity and statement of 
comprehensive income involves a 
degree of judgement and the 
application of estimation 
methodologies which can be 
subjective.
How the scope of our audit 
addressed the key audit matter
We reviewed the methodology applied 
and resulting allocation of costs 
between equity and statement of 
comprehensive income and ensured 
that costs had been properly applied 
to share premium account.
We tested a sample of invoices to 
ensure that the cost allocated to 
equity is only related to issuing 
new shares.
We reviewed the general ledger to 
ensure that all relevant costs were 
charged to share premium.

Destiny Pharma plc  Annual Report and Financial Statements 2017 Other information
The Directors are responsible for 
the other information. The other 
information comprises the information 
included in the Annual Report, other 
than the financial statements and our 
auditor’s report thereon. Our opinion 
on the financial statements does not 
cover the other information and, 
except to the extent otherwise 
explicitly stated in our report, we do 
not express any form of assurance 
conclusion thereon.
In connection with our audit of the 
financial statements, our responsibility 
is to read the other information and, in 
doing so, consider whether the other 
information is materially inconsistent 
with the financial statements or our 
knowledge obtained in the audit or 
otherwise appears to be materially 
misstated. If we identify such material 
inconsistencies or apparent material 
misstatements, we are required to 
determine whether there is a material 
misstatement in the financial 
statements or a material misstatement 
of the other information. If, based on 
the work we have performed, we 
conclude that there is a material 
misstatement of this other information, 
we are required to report that fact. 
We have nothing to report in this regard.
Opinion on other matter 
prescribed by the  
Companies Act 2006
In our opinion based on the work 
undertaken in the course of our audit: 
• the information given in the 
strategic report and the Directors’ 
report for the financial year for 
which the financial statements are 
prepared is consistent with the 
financial statements; and
• the Directors’ report and strategic 
report have been prepared in 
accordance with applicable legal 
requirements.
Matters on which we are required 
to report by exception:
In light of the knowledge and 
understanding of the company and its 
environment obtained in the course of 
the audit, we have not identified 
material misstatements in the strategic 
report or the Directors’ report.
We have nothing to report in respect 
of the following matters where the 
Companies Act 2006 requires us to 
report to you if, in our opinion:
• adequate accounting records have 
not been kept by the company, or 
returns adequate for our audit have 
not been received from branches 
not visited by us; or
• the financial statements are not in 
agreement with the accounting 
records and returns; or
• certain disclosures of Directors’ 
remuneration specified by law 
are not made; or
• we have not received all the 
information and explanations 
we require for our audit.
Responsibilities of the Directors 
for the financial statements
As explained more fully in the 
Directors’ responsibilities statement, 
the Directors are responsible for the 
preparation of the financial statements 
and for being satisfied that they give a 
true and fair view, and for such internal 
control as the directors determine is 
necessary to enable the preparation of 
financial statements that are free from 
material misstatement, whether due to 
fraud or error.
In preparing the financial statements, 
the directors are responsible for 
assessing the company’s ability to 
continue as a going concern, 
disclosing, as applicable, matters 
related to going concern and using 
the going concern basis of accounting 
unless the directors either intend to 
liquidate the company or to cease 
operations, or have no realistic 
alternative but to do so.
Auditor’s responsibilities for the 
audit of the financial statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable 
assurance about whether the financial 
statements as a whole are free from 
material misstatement, whether due to 
fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s 
report that includes our opinion. 
Reasonable assurance is a high level of 
assurance, but is not a guarantee that 
an audit conducted in accordance with 
ISAs (UK) will always detect a material 
misstatement when it exists.
Misstatements can arise from fraud 
or error and are considered material 
if, individually or in the aggregate, 
they could reasonably be expected 
to influence the economic decisions 
of users taken on the basis of these 
financial statements.
A further description of our 
responsibilities for the audit of the 
financial statements is located on the 
Financial Reporting Council’s website at: 
www.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities. 
This description forms part of our 
auditor’s report.
Use of our report
This report is made solely to the 
company’s members, as a body, in 
accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 
of the Companies Act 2006. Our audit 
work has been undertaken so that we 
might state to the company’s members 
those matters we are required to state 
to them in an auditor’s report and for 
no other purpose. To the fullest extent 
permitted by law, we do not accept or 
assume responsibility to anyone other 
than the company and the company’s 
members as a body, for our audit work, 
for this report, or for the opinions we 
have formed.

Destiny Pharma plc  Annual Report and Financial Statements 2017 Notes to the financial statements
1. Accounting policies
General information
Destiny Pharma plc (the “company”) was incorporated and domiciled in the UK on 4 March 1996 with registration number 
03167025. The company’s registered office is located at Unit 36, Sussex Innovation Centre, Science Park Square, Falmer, 
Brighton BN1 9SB.
The company is engaged in the discovery, development and commercialisation of new antimicrobials that have unique 
properties to improve outcomes for patients and the delivery of medical care into the future.
Basis of preparation
The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRSs”) 
as adopted by the European Union. The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention. 
The company’s financial statements have been presented in pound sterling (“GBP”), being the functional and presentation 
currency of the company. 
Standards and interpretations issued but not yet applied
At the date of authorisation of the company’s financial statements, certain new standards, amendments and interpretations 
to existing standards have been published by the International Accounting Standards Board but are not yet effective and 
have not been adopted early by the either the company. All relevant standards, amendments and interpretations to existing 
standards will be adopted in the company’s accounting policies in the first period beginning on or after the effective date 
of the relevant pronouncement.
The Directors do not anticipate that the adoption of these standards, amendments and interpretations will have a material 
impact on the company’s financial statements in the periods of initial application.
Segment reporting
The chief operating decision-maker is considered to be the Board of Directors of the company. The chief operating 
decision-maker allocates resources and assesses performance of the business and other activities at the operating 
segment level.
The chief operating decision-maker has determined that the company has one operating segment, the development and 
commercialisation of pharmaceutical formulations. All activities take place in the United Kingdom.
Financial instruments
Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised when the company becomes a party to the contractual provisions 
of the instrument. The company currently does not use derivative financial instruments to manage or hedge financial 
exposures or liabilities.
Financial assets and financial liabilities are initially measured at transaction price. Transaction costs that are directly 
attributable to the acquisition or issue of financial assets and financial liabilities (other than financial assets and financial 
liabilities at fair value through profit or loss) are added to, or deducted from, the fair value of the financial assets or financial 
liabilities, as appropriate, on initial recognition.
Cash and cash equivalents
Bank balances and cash in the statement of financial position comprise cash at banks and on hand.
Trade and other receivables and payables
Trade and other receivables and payables are initially recognised at fair value. Fair value is considered to be the original 
invoice amount, discounted where material, for short-term receivables and payables. Long-term receivables and payables 
are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method. Where receivables are denominated in a foreign 
currency, retranslation is made in accordance with the foreign currency accounting policy. 
36
Destiny Pharma plc  Annual Report and Financial Statements 2017 Derecognition of financial assets and liabilities
a) Financial assets
A financial asset is derecognised where:
• the right to receive cash flows from the asset has expired;
• the company retains the right to receive cash flows from the asset, but has assumed an obligation to pay them in full 
without material delay to a third party under a pass-through arrangement; or
• the company has transferred the rights to receive cash flows from the asset; and
i. either has transferred substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset; or
ii. has neither transferred nor retained substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset, but has transferred control 
of the asset.
b) Financial liabilities
A financial liability is derecognised when the obligation under the liability is discharged or cancelled or expires. Where an 
existing financial liability is replaced by another from the same lender on substantially different terms, or the terms of an 
existing liability are substantially modified, such an exchange or modification is treated as a derecognition of the original 
liability and the recognition of a new liability, and the difference in the respective carrying amounts is recognised in the 
statement of comprehensive income. 
Impairment of financial assets
Financial assets are assessed for indicators of impairment at the end of the reporting period. Financial assets are 
considered to be impaired when there is objective evidence that, as a result of one or more events that occurred after 
the initial recognition of the financial asset, the estimated future cash flows of the investment have been affected.
Share-based payments
Employees (including Directors and senior executives) of the company receive remuneration in the form of share-based 
payment transactions, whereby these individuals render services as consideration for equity instruments (“equity-settled 
transactions”). These individuals are granted share option rights approved by the Board. No cash-settled awards have been 
made or are planned. 
The cost of equity-settled transactions is recognised, together with a corresponding increase in equity, over the period in which 
the performance and/or service conditions are fulfilled, ending on the date on which the relevant individuals become fully 
entitled to the award (“vesting point”). The cumulative expense recognised for equity-settled transactions at each reporting 
date until the vesting date reflects the extent to which the vesting period has expired and the company’s best estimate of the 
number of equity instruments and value that will ultimately vest. The statement of comprehensive income charge for the year 
represents the movement in the cumulative expense recognised as at the beginning and end of that period. 
The fair value of share-based remuneration is determined at the date of grant and recognised as an expense in the 
statement of comprehensive income on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, taking account of the estimated 
number of shares that will vest. The fair value is determined by use of a Black-Scholes model.
Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses, if any. The cost 
of an asset comprises its purchase price and any directly attributable costs of bringing the asset to its present working 
condition and location for its intended use.
Depreciation is provided at the following annual rates in order to write off each asset over its estimated useful life:
• plant and machinery – between two and ten years.
Taxation
Current taxes are based on the results shown in the financial statements and are calculated according to local tax rules, 
using tax rates enacted or substantially enacted by the statement of financial position date. R&D tax credits are recognised 
on an accrual basis and are included as a current asset within trade and other receivables.
Financial statements Governance Strategic report
37
Destiny Pharma plc  Annual Report and Financial Statements 2017 1. Accounting policies continued
Research and development
Development costs and expenditure on pure and applied research are charged to the profit and loss account in the year 
in which they are incurred. Expenditure incurred on the development of internally generated products is capitalised when 
Phase 3 trials are completed and regulatory approval is obtained.
Foreign currency
Transactions in foreign currencies are initially recorded using the functional currency rate ruling at the date of the 
transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are re-translated at the functional currency 
rate of exchange ruling at the statement of financial position date. Any resulting exchange differences are included in the 
statement of comprehensive income. 
Pension costs
Contributions are made to the personal pension plans of certain employees. The expenditure is charged to the profit and 
loss account in the period to which it relates.
Going concern
The company has not yet recorded any revenues and funds its operations through periodic capital issues. Management 
prepares detailed working capital forecasts which are reviewed by the Board on a regular basis. Cash flow forecasts and 
projections take into account sensitivities on receipts, and costs. Having made relevant and appropriate enquiries, including 
consideration of the company’s current cash resources and the working capital forecasts, the Directors have a reasonable 
expectation that the company will have adequate cash resources to continue to meet the requirements of the business for 
at least the next twelve months. Accordingly, the Board continues to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the 
financial statements.
Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty
In the application of the company’s accounting policies, the Directors are required to make judgements, estimates 
and assumptions about the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. 
The estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and other factors that are considered to 
be relevant. Actual results may differ from these estimates.
Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised 
in the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period, or in the period of the revision and 
future periods if the revision affects both current and future periods.
The following critical judgements have been made by the Directors.
Costs of share issue
The company incurred incremental costs totalling £1.4 million in respect of the admission of its shares to trading on AIM 
and the associated issue of new shares. IAS 32: Financial Instruments: Presentation requires the costs of issuing new shares 
be charged against the share premium account within equity.
Management has reviewed the incremental costs to identify those incurred solely in issuing new shares, those incurred in 
connection with the entire share capital, and those not associated with issuing new shares at all. Those costs incurred in 
connection with the entire share capital have been apportioned to the issue of new shares by reference to the number of 
new shares compared to the entire share capital.
As a result of this, management has debited £0.9 million against share premium and charged the remaining £0.5 million 
to administrative expenses.
Share-based payments
The Directors have to make judgements when deciding on the variables to apply in arriving at an appropriate valuation 
of share-based compensation and similar awards including appropriate factors for volatility, risk free interest rate and 
applicable future performance conditions and exercise patterns. Further details of these factors can be found in note 12.

The calculation for loss per ordinary share (basic and diluted) for the relevant period is based on the earnings after income 
tax attributable to equity shareholders for the period. As the company made losses during the period, there are no dilutive 
potential ordinary shares in issue, and therefore basic and diluted loss per share are identical. The calculation is as follows:

Destiny Pharma plc  Annual Report and Financial Statements 2017 Share options
The expense arising from share-based payment transactions recognised in the year ended 31 December 2017 was £709,979 
(year ended 31 December 2016: £200,857).
The company’s share-based payment arrangements are summarised below.
Share option schemes
As part of its strategy for executive and key employee remuneration, the company issued share options under two schemes 
established on 15 November 2000 – an Unapproved Scheme and an EMI Scheme (the “Old Schemes”). During 2017, the 
company established two new share option schemes – the LTIP Employee Scheme and the LTIP Non-Employee Scheme, 
both of which were established on 18 April 2017 (the “New Schemes”). Awards under the LTIP Employee Scheme are made 
to qualifying employees and in accordance with Schedule 5 of the Income Tax (Earnings and Pensions) Act 2003 so that, 
provided awards are within the qualifying limits, the awards qualify as EMI options. Any awards under the LTIP Employee 
Scheme which do not fall within the qualifying limits do not qualify as EMI options. Awards under the LTIP Non-Employee 
Scheme do not qualify as EMI options.
The principal terms of the company’s share option schemes are as follows:
Unapproved Scheme
Options are granted at the discretion of the Directors. The price per share to be paid on exercise of an option will be the 
market value as agreed with the Share Valuation Division of HM Revenue & Customs at the time of the grant of the option 
and as detailed in the option certificate. Options may be exercised three years from the date of grant and lapse on the 
expiry of ten years from the date of grant of the option.
EMI Scheme
Options granted under the EMI Scheme are on substantially the same terms as options granted under the Unapproved 
Scheme, save that the EMI Scheme rules comply with the terms of the enterprise management incentive as set out in 
Schedule 14 of the Finance Act 2000.
Employee LTIP Scheme 
Options are granted at the discretion of the Directors to eligible employees in accordance with Schedule 5 of the Income 
Tax (Earnings and Pensions) Act 2003 up to the limits set out therein. The price per share to be paid on exercise of an 
Employee LTIP Option will be the market value as agreed with HMRC at the time of the grant of the option. Option lapse on 
the expiry of ten years from the date of grant, the date specified in any leaver provisions or any other lapse date specified in 
the relevant option agreement.
Non-Employee LTIP Scheme
Options are granted on substantially similar terms to the Employee LTIP Scheme except that the EMI and/or employment 
related provisions and requirements do not apply. These options can be granted to any Director of, or individual providing 
consultancy or other services to, the company.
Modification of schemes and reconciliation of share options in issue
During May and June 2017, modifications were made to the Old Schemes by issuing replacement options in the 
New Schemes to participants in the Old Schemes and new awards were subsequently made to individuals under the 
New Schemes.

(1)  On 23 January 2017 the company undertook a bonus issue of shares whereby 499 new ordinary shares were issued fully paid to the holders of each ordinary 
share by way of a partial capitalisation of share premium account. In addition, as explained below, some existing options where modified to reduce the number 
of options outstanding. Comparative figures have been adjusted to restate numbers and values of share options issued as if the bonus issue and modification 
had been in effect from 1 January 2016.

Modification of existing options
Options over 741,000 shares granted under the Old EMI Scheme and over 103,000 shares granted under the Old 
Unapproved Scheme were unchanged. The remaining options over 7,004,000 shares issued under the Old Schemes 
were modified so that, to exercise, the holders of such options now have the right to subscribe instead for an aggregate 
of 5,235,518 shares in the company. The number of such options and the exercise price of such options were determined 
by reference to the closing fair value of the ordinary shares on the day of modification. The modification of these options 
as described had a neutral effect on the option holders immediately before and after the amendment of the options.
15,696 share options were issued under the Old Schemes in the period to 31 December 2016. After adjusting for the bonus 
issue on 23 January 2017, 7,848,000 share options had been issued prior to the modification at adjusted weighted average 
exercise prices of between £0.2484 and £1.4522. 
The estimated fair value of all share options at the modification date was calculated by applying a Black-Scholes option 
pricing model. In the absence of a liquid market for the share capital of the company, the expected volatility of its share 
price is difficult to calculate. Therefore, the Directors considered the expected volatility used by listed entities in similar 
operating environments to calculate the expected volatility. The resulting incremental fair value was nil. 
The model inputs at the modification date were: 
• share price of £1.4522;
• exercise prices of between £0.2484 and £1.4522 per share;
• expected volatility of 49%; 
• remaining contractual life of options of between 5.37 and 9.65 years;
• risk-free interest rate of 1.4%; and
• expected dividends of £nil.
Grants of options 
On 16 May 2017, 172,152 Employee LTIP EMI Options were granted to Neil Clark (CEO) and 78,379 Employee LTIP EMI 
Options were granted to Simon Sacerdoti (CFO). On 2 June 2017, 172,153 Employee LTIP Non-EMI Options were granted 
to Mr Clark and 152,848 Employee-LTIP Non-EMI Options were granted to Mr Sacerdoti. All of the options are exercisable 
at a price of £0.01 per ordinary share either on the first anniversary of issue or the first anniversary of Admission.
The estimated fair value of share options granted under the New Schemes has been calculated by applying a Black-Scholes 
option pricing model. In the absence of a liquid market for the share capital of the company the expected volatility of its 
share price is difficult to calculate. Therefore, the Directors have considered the expected volatility used by listed entities 
in similar operating environments to calculate the expected volatility. The weighted average fair value of options granted 
in the period was £1.44 (2016: £0.64).
The model inputs were: 
      2017 2016

15. Capital risk management
The Directors’ objectives when managing capital are to safeguard the company’s ability to continue as a going concern in 
order to provide returns for shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders, and to maintain an optimal capital structure 
to reduce the cost of capital. At the date of these financial statements, the company had been financed from shareholders. 
In the future, the capital structure of the company is expected to consist of equity attributable to equity holders of the 
company, comprising issued share capital and reserves.
The company is not subject to any externally imposed capital requirements.
16. Ultimate controlling party
As no shareholder owns in excess of 50% of the total share capital of the company, the Directors consider there to be no 
ultimate controlling party.

capital.

account amounting to £18,016,550 was transferred to the profit and loss reserve.
19. First-time adoption of IFRS

with IFRS. For periods up to, and including, the year ended 31 December 2016, the company prepared its financial

Accordingly, the company has prepared financial statements which comply with IFRS applicable for periods ending on,
