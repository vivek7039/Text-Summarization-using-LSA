Operational highlights
1
Strategy on track in 
a year of transition
We launched our revised strategy in March 2016 and 
highlighted that 2017 would be a year of transition. 
Our improved results reflect that our strategy is on 
track as we continue to invest in strategic themes, 
operate more effectively across the business, 
taking advantage of our scale but still remaining 
entrepreneurial and actively manage the portfolio.
 2
Financial independence
DMGT’s reduction of its equity interest in Euromoney 
from 68% to 49% through a combination of share 
buyback and market placing has provided 
Euromoney with balance sheet independence 
from DMGT. This has allowed us to accelerate 
our management of the portfolio and enabled the 
adoption of a new, progressive dividend policy 
with an increase in pay-out ratio.
 3
Active portfolio management
Active portfolio management is one of the pillars 
of our strategy. By selling businesses which are 
not strategic for us and buying ones which fit our 
strategy, we continue to recycle capital towards 
our best opportunities. 
 4
A new operating model
We have established a Group Management Board 
made up of our divisional and functional leaders. 
We continue to serve our four segments through 
this structure, ensuring that our businesses remain 
entrepreneurial while enabling them to benefit 
from economies of scale, best practice and 
stronger governance. 
 5
Improved governance
We have made good progress in a range of areas 
such as recruiting new independent Non-Executive 
Directors, reconstituting committee memberships, 
appointing a Senior Independent Director and 
making sure our Board is more diverse in its makeup. 
A detailed reconciliation of the Group’s statutory and adjusted results is set out on pages 29 and 30

PRICE REPORTING:  
A 3.0 INFORMATION BUSINESS 
Three years ago Metal Bulletin published a 
story about fictitious copper and aluminium sales 
which resulted in the price for Shanghai bonded-
warehouse copper dropping by a fifth. Recognising 
the need for a robust price, Metal Bulletin launched 
a Shanghai copper price which has since become 
an important benchmark, so much so that the 
Chicago Mercantile Exchange has launched a 
derivative contract which will be settled using 
Metal Bulletin’s price. This price will provide the 
market with a hedging option for copper sold 
to China, the world’s largest consumer of the 
commodity, and generate additional revenues 
for our price-reporting business. It illustrates the 
close relationship between news and prices, as 
well as highlighting the potential for our price- 
reporting businesses to establish more benchmarks 
for use by buyers and sellers and on exchanges.

new Non-Executive Directors: 
an important year for Euromoney
Our 2017 results 
atuay o a yar 
o tranition pu
John Botts
Chairman
Dear shareholders
This has been an important year for Euromoney. When CEO 
Andrew Rashbass defined our new strategy in March 2016, 
we said that 2017 would be a year of transition with a return 
to growth in 2018. Our 2017 results actually show a year of 
“transition plus”, using the strong US dollar to invest in our 
business and still deliver improved results compared with last 
year. Equally, the reorganisation of our management structure 
and the creation of the new Group Management Board has 
had a telling effect on performance. 
Independence
Euromoney magazine was first published in 1969 and the 
Company has benefitted ever since from the careful stewardship 
of Daily Mail and General Trust plc (DMGT) as the majority 
shareholder. In January 2017 DMGT reduced its holding in 
Euromoney to 49% by a secondary placing of Euromoney shares 
and a buyback by Euromoney of its own shares. The Company’s 
balance sheet is now independent of DMGT, increasing 
Euromoney’s financial flexibility.
DMGT’s foresight in enabling Euromoney to become 
independent and its continued strong shareholder support 
are welcome and appreciated. Their decision has helped 
Euromoney accelerate the implementation of our strategy for 
the benefit of all shareholders. 
Dividends 
During the course of the year, the Company approved a new, 
progressive dividend policy with an increase in the dividend 
pay-out ratio from approximately 33% to approximately 40% of 
adjusted diluted earnings per share, subject to the needs of the 
business. The reduction of the shares in issue following the share 
buyback, combined with the increase in pay-out ratio, enabled 
the Board to approve a 26% increase in the interim dividend to 
8.8p per share which was paid to shareholders in June. In line 
with the new policy, the Board is recommending to shareholders 
a 33% increase in the final dividend to 21.8p per share to be 
paid on 15 February 2018, giving a total dividend for the year 
of 30.6p (2016: 23.4p).

With independence comes responsibility, and the shape 
and composition of our Board and Committees is changing. 
Good progress has been made in recruiting new independent 
Non-Executive Directors, reconstituting Committee 
memberships, appointing a Senior Independent Director, 
making sure that our Board is more diverse in its make-up 
and appointing the Company’s first General Counsel, who 
also acts as Secretary to the Board. Although this work is not 
complete the momentum is reassuring.
The coming year
As the strategy becomes embedded in how the Group operates, 
I have decided now is the right time for me to hand over the 
Chairmanship of the Company. It has been a privilege to 
serve on the Euromoney Board for over 20 years including as 
Chairman for the last two. Our results demonstrate that the 
strategy which the Company is implementing is working and 
I am confident that I hand over the chairmanship to David 
Pritchard with the Company in a strong position. David will 
lead the process to appoint a new Chairman and be Acting 
Chairman in the meantime.
Our results demonstrate that the strategy under Andrew’s 
leadership is working and I am confident that Euromoney 
is in a strong position. 
May I thank our shareholders, my Euromoney colleagues and 
fellow Directors for your support. I look forward to watching 
the Company go from strength-to-strength and becoming a 
3.0 information business.
As we continue to operate in challenging times, the dedication 
and skill of Andrew, the Group Management Board and our 
staff across the world remain the defining feature of this 
remarkable Company.

Euromoney AR2017 Strategic-Proof 6.indd   7 12/11/2017   12:13:17 PM Market overview
How we are responding to 
the issues driving our markets
 
Asset management
Asset management is operating under 
headwinds created by regulation, the 
increasing use of passive investment 
approaches at the expense of traditional, 
long-only active fund management, disruptive 
competition and changing customer needs. 
These market drivers are reducing traditional 
asset management revenues and changing 
the structure of the industry.  
KEY MARKET DRIVERS
1.  MiFID II is creating new requirements for research 
discovery, valuation and benchmarking
2.  New technologies are transforming and replacing 
components of the asset management value-chain
3.  Funds are shifting from traditional active managers 
to passive and alternative funds
HOW WE ARE RESPONDING
• As an independent research provider we are well placed 
to benefit from MiFID II, unbundling research fees will 
increase our available market. As implementation 
continues and demand changes we will investigate 
investing in new products
• We will continue to monitor the market closely to identify 
potential threats from new technology. We already 
partner with and invest in two disruptive technology 
firms Zanbato and Estimize
• Over the past 12 months we have begun to develop 
and launch new offerings, to target directly the needs 
of passive and alternative asset managers

Pricing, data & market intelligence
The prevalence of price reporting and 
discovery has spread to new sectors. 
Benchmarks in new sectors are being 
incorporated into financial instruments. 
Business data use has increased in many areas 
from project and asset financing to insurance, 
and clients are demanding more innovative 
and advanced information tools.  
 
KEY MARKET DRIVERS
1.  Growth in the pricing market is driven by increased 
use of benchmarks in financial contracts
2.  Big data and technology improvements are 
increasing expectations for data and tools
HOW WE ARE RESPONDING
• We are capitalising on growth as demonstrated by the 
acquisition of RISI and development of new prices and 
benchmarks across our price reporting businesses
• We have invested in our data and tools, for example 
integrating a fleet database into AirFinance and 
improving the data tools for IJ Global

Banking & ﬁnance
The low interest rate environment continues, 
which reduces banks’ revenues. However, 
several central banks are indicating that rates 
are likely to rise. The banking and finance 
industry has faced increased regulation 
and although this trend is reversing, 
investment is still required to ensure 
compliance. Competition has increased 
noticeably from established technology 
firms and new FinTech entrants. 
KEY MARKET DRIVERS
1.  Recovery in the banking industry is supporting banks’ 
share prices
2.  Regulation is affecting the banking industry and 
requires significant resources to be allocated towards 
meeting compliance goals
3.  Banks in various developing markets are 
internationalising, particularly driven by their domestic 
customers travelling and doing business abroad 
HOW WE ARE RESPONDING
• Clients are demanding more services and need 
more support to differentiate their offering. We are 
developing marketing services using the strength of 
Rival Advocacy™ to offer a comprehensive service
• We are supporting banks in complying with their 
regulatory requirements and enabling them to 
prepare for the future structure of the industry
• We have created a Euromoney China team to react 
to the opportunity and enable us to serve better the 
local market

Commodity events
Overall commodity price rises have increased 
revenues for the markets we serve: grain due to 
tightness in maize supplies and coal due to a 
cut in production. Metal prices are increasing 
due to strong demand, particularly in China, 
expectations of infrastructure investment in the 
US and supply constraints in some markets.  
 
 
KEY MARKET DRIVERS
1.  Commodity prices in the markets we serve have 
been increasing
2.  Events are experiencing heightened security 
concerns and more disruption from extreme weather
HOW WE ARE RESPONDING
• We have launched new events and are focusing on 
areas of growth, for example launching Mining Cumbre, 
a Latin American mining investment event
• In order to mitigate and manage risks, the Company’s 
event operations managers are required to complete 
a new rigorous online risk assessment

Andrew Rashbass 
Chief Executive Officer
Overview
At the Investor Day in March 2016 we said that 2017 would be a 
year of transition. I believe our performance in 2017 shows that 
the strategy is working and we are slightly ahead of schedule.
We have been able to speed up the strategy because of the 
financial independence that resulted from DMGT’s decision 
to reduce its holding in Euromoney, which they completed 
in January and by investing some of the benefit from the 
strengthened US dollar compared to sterling. We have 
delivered a return to growth with both year-on-year revenue 
and profit ahead of 2016 though this included significant help 
from exchange rates. We remained focused on our use of 
capital by investing in the big themes, such as our acquisition of 
RISI, and disinvesting from areas which would otherwise create 
a drag. We have also made good progress fixing structurally 
challenged businesses and returning them to growth.
In May 2017 we announced a new, progressive dividend policy 
which aims to pay out approximately 40% of adjusted earnings 
each year. The new policy, the share buyback, improved Group 
performance and our strong balance sheet have enabled us to 
recommend to shareholders a significant increase in dividend 
for the year.
In the year ahead we shall continue to focus on delivering 
growth through investing in areas of opportunity and 
disinvesting from areas that are structurally and cyclically 
challenged.
Strategy
Our strategy is to manage a portfolio of businesses in markets 
where information, data and convening market participants 
are valued. We deliver products and services that support our 
clients’ critical activities. In particular, we look to serve markets 
which are semi-opaque; that is, where the information which 
organisations need in order to operate effectively is hard to find.
We characterise the business models of B2B information 
companies into three generations, which we call B2B 
Information 1.0, 2.0 and 3.0. Their characteristics are set 
out on page 11.
As we manage our portfolio to achieve our strategy and to 
become a 3.0 business, we categorise our business into four 
quadrants. We allocate capital to the top two quadrants and 
withdraw capital from the bottom two.
This quadrant-based assessment leads to three pillars of 
strategic activity:
1.  Investing around the big themes. These include price 
discovery, post-trade activities, asset management and 
telecoms.
2.  Transform the operating model. There are two aspects to 
our model. One is our target business model (see page 14). 
The second is a best-of-both-worlds operating model which 
combines Euromoney’s entrepreneurial culture with strong 
central functions that support the businesses and enable us 
to take advantage of our scale.
3.  Actively manage the portfolio. Acquisitions have always 
been, and remain, an important part of Euromoney’s 
strategy. We have a record of identifying businesses where 
our ownership adds value. We also sell businesses where we 
believe we are not the best owners and to generate capital 
to invest in the big themes.

Euromoney AR2017 Strategic-Proof 6.indd   10 12/11/2017   12:13:28 PM Our strategy is designed to develop the businesses we own and 
deliver strategic, timely, and well-executed acquisitions and 
disposals. We aim to allocate and recycle capital efficiently 
to good organic and inorganic opportunities via our operating 
model. Our ambition is to generate consistent and meaningful 
returns for our shareholders at relatively low risk.
Investing around the big themes
Our big themes enable us to exploit market and industry 
opportunities. In response to the challenges in our asset 
management segment (BCA, NDR and Institutional Investor) 
due to MiFID II and the shift from active to passive investing, 
our product development is geared to growing segments of 
the market:
• BCA is developing new products targeting passive, specialist 
and alternative investments
• NDR is providing tools for registered investment advisors (RIAs)
• II is launching new products targeting defined contribution 
pensions, RIAs and the private wealth sector

Transforming the operating model
We have now embedded our strategy throughout the 
organisation with our best-of-both-worlds operating model. 
This has included the creation of seven divisions (grouped 
into our four reporting segments) and five functions under 
the leadership of our new Group Management Board to 
serve our customers better.

Continued
Actively managing the portfolio
We continue to manage our portfolio, investing in our big 
themes, removing the bottom-left quadrant drag of businesses 
which are structurally challenged or finding better owners for 
businesses which do not fit with our strategy. During the year 
we bought RISI, BroadGroup and Layer123 and disposed of 
six businesses – HedgeFund Intelligence, II Intelligence, 
Euromoney Indices, Latin Finance, Adhesion and World Bulk 
Wine (the last two completing after year-end). We continue 
to look for acquisitions which are, or have the potential to be, 
3.0 businesses. We have also decided to review strategic 
options for our Global Markets Intelligence division (CEIC and 
EMIS) and you will see that they are identified in this report as 
held for sale. These are good businesses, but ones which we 
believe may fit another owner’s strategy better. If sold this 
would give us the opportunity to recycle more capital towards 
our big themes.
Performance for the year
Headwinds for our asset management businesses (BCA, NDR 
and Institutional Investor) meant that revenues in this segment 
were under pressure during the year, but we managed costs 
carefully. Other businesses performed strongly particularly 
Metal Bulletin, TelCap and Insurance Insider. 
Overall, total and statutory revenues are both up 6%  
year-on-year and adjusted profit before tax is up 4% on 
last year, primarily due to the favourable USD-GBP rate, 
the high margin flow-through from the asset management 
segment and the prior year restructuring of our training 
business. Our full-year adjusted profit before tax of £106.5m 
represents a strong performance for the Group in the year of 
transition with adjusted diluted earnings per share growing 
to 76.4p from 66.5p last year, a 15% increase. Statutory profit 
before tax of £40.7m is lower than adjusted profit before tax 
due to exceptional items, primarily the impairment charge 
taken for NDR in the first half, and acquired intangible 
amortisation. In addition, Euromoney’s tradition of strong 
cash generation continues with underlying conversion 
of adjusted operating profit to cash in the year at 118%. 
These results demonstrate our ability to both invest for 
growth and manage the business effectively.
Outlook
With uncertainty still surrounding Brexit and a challenging 
geopolitical climate we are operating in a volatile environment. 
We expect our asset management businesses to continue 
facing challenging market conditions due to the headwinds our 
customers face but believe our risk mitigation plans will reduce 
the impact. Commodity markets are improving and our banking 
clients are experiencing a recovery, although the uncertainty 
over Brexit negotiations could make this short-lived. 
Our plans are built around these factors and we will continue 
investing for future growth while managing risk. 
The strategy we unveiled in March 2016 is working. Growth 
returned slightly ahead of schedule in 2017, which we still regard 
as a year of transition, and our view is that 2018, the third year of 
our strategy, will be a year of further and accelerated growth.

The Group manages a portfolio of B2B businesses across four segments: asset management; pricing, data & market intelligence; 
banking & finance; and commodity events. We have created seven divisions to serve our four segments more effectively. As part 
of our best-of-both-worlds operating model we have also created five central functions, again to serve our four segments better. 
The leaders of our divisions, who also serve our segments, and our functional leaders, sit on a newly created Group Management 
Board which operates under the direction and authority of the CEO. It assists the CEO and Finance Director in implementing 
strategy; monitoring financial performance; developing the Group’s approach to managing employees; taking joint responsibility 
for the Group’s approach to corporate governance; and ensuring that the Group’s best-of-both-worlds operating model works. 
The Group Management Board meets monthly to discuss strategic, operational and financial issues.

Corporate Development manages 
our M&A activity. A significant success 
during the year was the Group’s 
acquisition of RISI. This was the 
Company’s largest acquisition since 
the purchase of Metal Bulletin plc 
more than 10 years ago. We were 
able to compete with private equity 
firms in part due to our ability to 
complete transactions quickly 
and efficiently.
Central Marketing is responsible for 
sharing best practice and achieving 
economies of scale. We do this by 
developing training, managing 
suppliers used by more than one 
division, maintaining the Group 
customer database, and providing 
experts in specialist areas.
Central Technology supports the 
Group’s technology infrastructure 
maintaining data-centre-hosted 
and cloud-hosted services, running 
helpdesks and implementing and 
supporting networks and common 
applications. We work closely with 
the technology teams in the segments 
and divisions who focus on 
developing client-facing products.
Finance carries out the full range 
of financial activities across the 
Group, supporting the segments 
and divisions. Following DMGT’s 
sell down, Finance has taken on 
functions previously provided by 
DMGT such as tax, treasury and 
internal audit and strengthened 
others. In addition, it negotiated 
new external borrowing facilities 
for the Group.
Global Human Resources is 
responsible for recruitment, 
retention and development of 
staff. This year we changed our 
approach to hiring people for 
senior roles, introducing a more 
formal, evidence-based process.
Legal, Risk and Programmes 
includes the Group’s legal, 
risk, information-security and 
programme-management experts. 
The department was heavily 
involved in the transactional, legal 
and regulatory work required for our 
share buyback – a complex project 
with tight deadlines.

INVEST AROUND  
BIG THEMES
We look to serve semi-opaque 
markets where the information 
organisations need in order to 
operate effectively is hard to find. 
This determines our big themes 
which include price discovery,  
post-trade activities, asset 
management and telecoms.

TRANSFORM THE  
OPERATING MODEL
We have developed what we call 
a best-of-both-worlds operating 
model. Euromoney is known for its 
entrepreneurial culture – our people 
are creative, action-oriented, close to 
their customers, passionate about 
their brands, knowledgeable about 
the industries they serve and 
accountable for their results.

ACTIVELY MANAGE  
THE PORTFOLIO
Acquisitions have always been, 
and remain, an important part of 
Euromoney’s strategy. We have a 
record of identifying good businesses 
where our ownership adds value. 
We also sell businesses where we 
believe we are not the best owners, 
and to generate capital to invest 
in the big themes.

Strategic report
Euromoney AR2017 Strategic-Proof 6.indd   15 12/11/2017   12:13:39 PM Our strategy
Our strategy is to manage a portfolio 
of businesses in markets where 
information, data and convening 
market participants are valued. 
We deliver products and services that 
support our clients’ critical activities 
Our quadrants 
Financial performance will come from a rigorous allocation of 
capital. We allocate capital towards those businesses which 
we consider are, or can be, successful B2B 3.0 businesses 
(see page 11). Depending on market cycle and structure, 
we categorise our businesses into four quadrants. 
We allocate capital to the top two quadrants and withdraw 
capital from the bottom two. A cyclical downturn can create 
opportunity for a structurally strong business. For instance, 
when commodities markets were depressed, we put targeted 
investment into Metal Bulletin – we bought FastMarkets and 
invested in systems and people among other things. This 
improved our market position so that as the commodity market 
turned we were able to take a disproportionate share of the 
uptick. We have invested in top-right businesses like those we 
have serving the insurance sector. The combination of structural 
and cyclical strength means those businesses are now growing 
fast. However, for markets which are structurally challenged, 
we will disinvest and reallocate capital.
This quadrant-based assessment leads to three pillars of 
strategic activity: investing around the big themes, transforming 
the operating model and actively managing the portfolio.

PROGRESS 
MADE IN 2017
  • Invested in product 
development. For example: 
BCA products targeting passive, 
specialist and alternative 
investments; NDR tools for 
registered investment 
advisors; Euromoney’s 
thought leadership initiative; 
and Institutional Investor’s 
ManagerMatch service;
• Invested heavily in our price 
reporting capabilities with the 
acquisition of RISI, the leading 
price reporting agency for the 
global forest products market
• Through the acquisitions of 
BroadGroup and Layer123 
we expanded the market and 
customer segments our telecoms 
events businesses serve
• Increased our investment in and 
reshaped our relationship with 
Zanbato, a company offering 
institutional investors alternative 
investment opportunities
• Created seven divisions 
(Price Reporting & Analytics, 
Investment Research, 
Institutional Investor, Banking 
& Finance, Specialist 
Information, Events and Global 
Market Intelligence) to serve our 
four segments more effectively
• Created a Group Management 
Board to provide a new 
operating framework for the 
Group’s divisions and functions
• Continued to develop and build 
our strong central functions 
such as HR, IT, Corporate 
Development, Finance, Legal, 
Risk and Programmes to support 
our businesses
• Improved the technology 
leadership in the price-reporting 
businesses and investment 
research divisions
• Introduced sophisticated 
approaches to how we price 
our products at BCA and 
Metal Bulletin
• Successfully integrated 
FastMarkets into our price 
reporting division
• Acquisitions of RISI, BroadGroup 
and Layer123
• Sold Euromoney Indices, 
II Intelligence, LatinFinance, 
HedgeFund Intelligence, and 
after the financial year-end, 
Adhesion and World Bulk Wine

in big themes is having a 
positive financial impact.
61 %
subscription revenue share of

Following the DMGT share  
sell down and buyback the 
Group is no longer able to use 
DMGT central services and 
the investment in Euromoney’s 
functions has enabled the 
Group to operate as a 
standalone company.
We have reduced drag impact 
of underperforming businesses 
by £4m through the above 
sales and grown revenue in 
our Price Reporting & Analytics 
division to £57m with a 29% 
operating margin.
+4%

PRIORITIES 
FOR 2018
Further investment in these areas 
through acquisition, product 
development and expansion into 
new segments or geographies.
Ensure we take advantage of 
Euromoney’s scale, share best 
practice, operate strategically 
and create career paths for staff 
across the Group.
Continue to evaluate potential 
M&A opportunities to reallocate 
capital and accelerate the 
Group’s transition towards being 
a B2B 3.0 information business.

Euromoney actively manages

Adjusted profit before tax increased by 4% to

following the DMGT sell down.
UNDERLYING REVENUE GROWTH 1

Underlying revenue growth 
compares revenues on a 
like-for-like basis and is an 
important indicator of the 
health and trajectory of our 
segments and the Group 
as a whole. The definition of 
underlying revenue is set out 
on page 31. 2017 2016 2015 2014 2013
1%
3%
(4%) (4%)
(1%)
Underlying revenues fell by 1% due to the increasing 
cyclical headwinds caused by MiFID II in the asset 
management sector, the elimination of low-margin 
events in the first and fourth quarters of 2017 
and the decision not to repeat events in certain 
markets due to increased geopolitical instability. 
These factors were largely offset by the strong 
performance from the pricing, data & market 
intelligence segment and the improved sentiment 
in the banking and commodities markets.
SUBSCRIPTION BOOK OF BUSINESS 1
 
Book of Business (‘BoB’) 
represents the annual 
contracted values for 
subscriptions across the 
Group and reflects the 
impact of new sales, 
price increases, upgrades, 
downgrades and full 
cancellations. It is a key 
indicator of the Group’s 
subscriptions growth.

The subscription BoB growth was 0.4%, reflecting 
the increasing headwinds affecting our asset

ADJUSTED OPERATING MARGIN 1

The movement in adjusted 
operating margin measures 
the efficiency of the Group. 
Consistent operating margin 
improvement is a business 
imperative, driven by 
investment choices, our focus 
on driving out costs and 
improving mix. 2017 2016 2015 2014 2013
30% 30%
26%
25% 25%
The adjusted operating margin fell from 25.2% 
to 25.0% largely due to the required investment 
in standalone company costs following the 
DMGT sell down and the need to operate as 
an independent group. This drag was partly 
offset by the favourable currency mix.
ADJUSTED DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE 1
 
Management seeks sustained 
long-term growth in adjusted 
diluted earnings per share to 
maximise overall returns to 
our shareholders.

Cash conversion is a measure 
of the quality of Euromoney’s 
earnings. The objective is

Euromoney AR2017 Strategic-Proof 6.indd   19 12/11/2017   12:13:41 PM Segment review
We have created seven divisions 
to serve our four segments 
more effectively
Asset management
The asset management segment includes the brands and 
businesses that serve the global asset management industry. 
It provides independent research that enables our clients to 
make informed investment decisions; runs networks and 
conferences that bring asset allocators and asset managers 
together in an effective and efficient way; and provides news 
and data that are critical for the industry to stay informed and 
visible in an increasingly complex world. Its main brands include 
BCA, Ned Davis Research (NDR) and the Institutional Investor 
family of businesses. 
More than 80% of the segment revenues are derived from 
subscriptions to its research and data products and annual 
membership fees.

Total asset management revenues increased by 10% to £171.8m. 
Underlying revenues were flat in the first half of the year, 
followed by a 4% decline in the second half, largely reflecting 
the increasing cyclical headwinds caused by the MiFID II 
regulations.
Despite these headwinds, the adjusted operating margin 
improved from 35% to 37%, reflecting the Group’s rigorous 
approach to capital allocation as the cyclical headwinds 
in asset management worsened. During the year, the asset 
management businesses shifted from the top-right to the  
top-left quadrant. Hence the segment’s businesses focussed 
on battening down the hatches and successfully implemented 
profit protection measures to deliver a 3% underlying growth in 
adjusted profit before tax.

BCA: HELPING OUR CUSTOMERS  
TO NAVIGATE MIFID II 
BCA embarked on a digital and multi-channel 
engagement programme to help inform its customers 
about the likely impact of MiFID II which comes into 
force in January 2018. We combined a range of online 
marketing tools to build customer awareness, share our 
expertise as thought-leaders and create an advisory 
service. By placing senior executives at the centre of 
the campaign BCA has demonstrated its subject 
matter expertise resulting in wide media coverage. 
To compliment this we launched a MiFID II microsite 
containing information for customers using webcasts, 
video, podcasts and online articles. We have also 
created an online assessment tool for our customers 
to measure their MiFID II readiness. This has resulted in 
strong customer engagement with our digital channels. 
We will continue to inform and guide our customers as 
MiFID II is implemented.

The pricing, data and market intelligence segment houses 
businesses span many industries that provide information and 
analysis critical for our clients’ business processes and 
workflows. The segment’s largest business is Metal Bulletin, 
a leading price reporting agency for the metals and mining 
industries, but also includes our businesses active in the 
telecoms, insurance, airline and banking industries. Two-thirds 
of the segment’s revenues are derived from subscriptions.
Price discovery is a big theme and is expected to grow 
significantly as most industries are seeking more transparency 
around the prices and risks they face in their traditionally 
opaque markets. During 2017 we enhanced our capabilities 
through the acquisition of RISI, a leading price reporting 
agency for the global forest-products market.

integrated FastMarkets, and the Group’s wholesale telecoms 
business, TelCap. Underlying revenues were up 3%. 
The segment’s adjusted operating margin decreased 
from 33% to 31%, largely reflecting significant headcount 
investment in Metal Bulletin, TelCap and Legal Media Group 
to drive new product and sales initiatives, together with costs 
to integrate FastMarkets into Metal Bulletin and to enhance 
TelCap’s events portfolio. On an underlying basis, adjusted 
operating profit was down 6%.
SPECIALIST INFORMATION:  
INVESTING IN PRODUCT
Over the last two years we have invested in our 
AirFinance Journal business. We acquired a fleet 
database and hired leading air finance sector analysts. 
These investments have been responsible for AirFinance 
Journal’s strong trading, ahead of our investment case. 
We have strong market share in the fast-growing aircraft 
finance sector and are evolving plans to benefit further 
from the tailwinds the sector is experiencing. We are 
working with our customers to develop tools that allow 
them to better evaluate assets in this sector. Product 
development work is progressing. Our tools will support 
our customers’ decision-making for large capital 
investments, assist their business prospecting and allow 
our business to capitalise on the growth of both primary 
and secondary markets. Working closely with our 
customers on product development, our strong market 
position enables us to benefit from further growth in 
this area.

Banking & ﬁnance
Banking & finance provides market intelligence, news, training 
and conferences to the global finance industry. It includes the 
flagship Euromoney magazine, a leading publication for the 
global banking sector, which, through its awards for excellence, 
has been the arbiter of status for banks for over 45 years. 
Its conferences across the Euromoney and IMN brands are 
the pre-eminent events for their specific industry sectors. 
The segment derives over 70% of its revenues from delegates 
and sponsorships for its events.

Total revenues increased by 3% to £69.8m, largely due to the 
strength of the US dollar improving IMN’s growth rate. On an 
underlying basis, revenues were down 6% reflecting the Group’s 
actions to eliminate low-margin events and training courses in 
the first and fourth quarters. This was partly offset by some 
success in the strategic investment in thought-leadership 
products in Euromoney magazine.
The adjusted operating margin improved from 15% to 20%, 
largely due to the successful restructure of the training business 
in the second half of 2016. As a result, on an underlying basis, 
adjusted operating profit increased by 7%.
BANKING & FINANCE: THOUGHT 
LEADERSHIP AND RIVAL ADVOCATES
Euromoney magazine has long been known as an 
arbiter of status in finance. It is now building on its 
existing accreditation platforms such as the Euromoney 
Awards for Excellence by creating digital amplification 
campaigns to showcase key award findings to its clients' 
customers and peers. Euromoney has developed the 
process of peer influence between banks as a powerful 
marketing tool through its Rival Advocacy™ system which 
improves customers’ net promoter scores. Euromoney is 
achieving this by combining its authoritative banking 
coverage with a new, digital audience development 
platform which draws on Euromoney’s database of 
financial and corporate leaders. These techniques 
place Euromoney at the heart of content-marketing 
and thought leadership in finance.

Total revenues were down 6% to £27.4m, and down 8% on an 
underlying basis. Despite the pick-up in commodities markets 
during the year, this performance largely reflects the ‘self-help’ 
strategic actions taken in 2016 to consolidate some of the 
segment’s event activities and the decision not to repeat events 
in certain markets in the fourth quarter due to increased 
geopolitical instability. 
The adjusted operating margin fell from 27% to 25%, primarily 
due to the challenging market conditions faced by some of 
the segment’s large commodities-related events before the 
improvement in cycle. As a result, adjusted operating profit 
fell by an underlying 10%.
COALTRANS EVENTS: BENEFITTING FROM 
A MARKET ON THE UPTURN
Increased demand for coal in Asia has driven coal prices 
up and we have therefore focused our Coaltrans portfolio 
in that region during 2017. The Group’s global footprint 
enables us to pivot and divert resource where needed 
across the world. At Coaltrans Asia, our hallmark event, 
over 800 coal professionals gathered for two days of 
networking and deal-making. Our performance is 
enabling us to invest in our core events and event 
formats as well as an expanded portfolio and we will 
continue to do so in order to meet the evolving content 
and networking needs of our audience.

Strategic report
Euromoney AR2017 Strategic-Proof 6.indd   23 12/11/2017   12:13:53 PM Corporate and social responsibility
Our approach to Corporate and 
Social Responsibility (CSR) is 
largely led by staff
The global nature of our Group and the fact that it serves a 
wide range of customers gives people an opportunity to 
communicate and interact with different sections of society 
across the world. Our success owes much to understanding 
and engaging with the communities we serve. 
People
Euromoney is well known as a place where entrepreneurs 
do well. Historically this may have meant we overlooked some 
of the benefits of being a large group. That is changing, but 
we want to remain a place where innovators and self-starters 
thrive and those who want and deserve responsibility and 
relish accountability can still progress rapidly. We call 
combining the best of Euromoney’s entrepreneurial culture 
with the benefits of being a substantial corporation without 
the downsides of either, our best-of-both-worlds model. 
We talk about it in more detail in the strategy section on page 17. 
One part of that is introducing more opportunities for staff to 
develop their careers in the Group. 
Two years ago, we operated as 30 or so separate businesses. 
A talented individual who rose quickly in a business might 
decide that they had to leave in order to continue to 
develop their career. By combining businesses into seven 
divisions and by co-ordinating our management of people 
across the whole of Euromoney we are now able to help our 
staff develop their careers beyond their current business. 
Better career prospects and more development means our 
staff become more experienced and skilled, which will 
enhance their performance and encourage them to stay in 
the Group. Gillian Fox, our Global HR Director, is leading this 
and other changes in approach, working closely with our 
divisional and functional heads.
Here are a few best-of-both-worlds people-related examples:
• We want to recruit staff who will like our culture; but we don’t 
want to hire people simply to fit in, so we are introducing more 
rigorous, evidence-based recruitment practices. 
• We take seriously our duty to care for our staff. We want to ensure 
our people still travel to, and run events in, emerging and frontier 
markets. But we want to make sure they can do so as safely as 
possible and that we always consider the safety of delegates 
who attend our events. So we have introduced training on 
travelling safely and a comprehensive event-safety assessment 
and accompanying training for our event organisers. 
• At Euromoney we have always given people responsibility 
early in their careers. In 2018 we will focus on training staff as 
managers. We will also make sure that we have successors 
identified and developed for critical roles across the Group. 
Diversity and inclusion
Our business is dependent on recruiting, retaining, developing 
and motivating talented people. The talents we need do not 
depend on gender, sexual orientation, religion, ethnic or 
national origin, race, colour, age, disability or socio-economic 
background. We recognise that we need to do more to appeal 
to everyone who could help us to succeed. Therefore over the 
past year we have started to focus more on diversity. Part of 
that is making sure that everyone can fulfil their potential at 
Euromoney and be, and feel, supported by the Company in 
doing so by fostering an environment of inclusion. There is 
always more work to be done and so this will continue in 2018.
We do not believe that diversity is about having a policy or 
a stand-alone initiative. It needs to permeate all people-
related activities. 
As an equal opportunity employer we seek to employ a 
workforce which reflects the diverse community at large. 
We do not discriminate in recruitment, promotion or other 
employee matters. The Group endeavours to provide a 
working environment free from discrimination, victimisation 
or harassment and we will not accept behaviours which 
contradict this.
Since the summer our Group Management Board has spent, 
and will continue to spend, time considering what more we can 
do to make the Group more diverse and inclusive. This includes 
understanding why women make up a smaller proportion of 
senior staff compared to their representation at more junior 
levels. We have started a pilot to focus on developing careers 
of high-potential women in the Company. We have changed 
our approach to hiring for senior roles to make sure short lists 
are diverse. We have introduced our first LGBT and women’s 
networks and have begun to roll out unconscious bias training. 
We are making sure the recruitment firms we use understand 
our seriousness about finding and attracting diverse candidates 
of the highest quality. We have also started working with a 
recruitment firm that specialises in helping firms hire talented 
black, Asian and minority ethnic staff, particularly those near 
the start of their career. Staff feedback on these programmes 
has been positive.
Gender pay gap analysis
We have analysed the pay of men and women in the UK. 
The analysis shows that we pay men and women roughly 
the same within each band of seniority. We will be doing further 
analysis of the small gaps that are revealed and will take any 
necessary remedial action. The issue the analysis highlights, 
however, is that we do not have enough senior women even 
though 47% of our Group overall are female. We need to work 
across the organisation to change this.

1 Above data reflects position at 22 November 2017. Two additional 
female Non-Executive Directors will join the Board before the 2018 AGM
Our commitment to improve gender balance applies across 
the Group. As already announced we are delighted that three 
talented and experienced female Non-Executive Directors 
are joining the Board. This is an example of how a focus on 
diversity widens the pool we can attract and brings in skills and 
experience from which the Board and Group will benefit hugely.
Environment
The Group has a small environmental footprint but that does 
not mean our staff do not want to help us contribute in this 
area. Our main offices are all located in central city locations 
which generally means staff travel to work by public transport. 
Our technology allows home-working, reducing work travel. 
Overseas trips must be justified. We try to do the easy things as 
a matter of course. For example, we switch most of the lights off 
at night. Our larger offices include shower facilities for staff who 
prefer to cycle or run to work. Within the office, recycling bins 
make recycling easy. 
We have found with our diversity initiatives that they work better 
when we harness the passion, energy and experience of our 
staff, not just via Company policy, we are taking the same 
approach with our environmental initiatives. Although our 
carbon footprint is small, we think we can do more and we 
intend to ask our staff across the world for their ideas for what 
else we can do. We shall report back next year.
Social investment
Our staff drive our charity fundraising, which comes from both 
individual fundraising efforts and the Group’s charitable budget. 
Our staff give their time generously to support a wide range of 
projects across the globe.
Hurricane Irma
Our colleagues at IMN ran their annual ABS East conference 
in Miami in the aftermath of Irma. They did so with the support 
of local government and agencies who wanted to show that 
Miami remained open for business. Our team was grateful 
for that support and the Company donated $100,000 to the 
Volunteer Florida Foundation to help with relief efforts 
and organised for conference delegates to get involved 
in relief efforts.
Over the year we have continued our work with TSF, Afghan 
Connection, AMREF/ORBIS and Haven House. 
TSF
Télécoms Sans Frontières (TSF) is an NGO specialising in 
emergency telecommunications and new technologies. It has 
led emergency relief efforts in 70 countries supporting millions 
of victims of conflict and natural disasters, as well as facilitating 
the relief efforts of more than 800 humanitarian organisations 
in war-torn and disaster zones. Since 2014 the Group has raised 
more than £130,000 to support TSF’s projects. 
Afghan Connection
Afghan Connection (AC) has over 10 years’ experience 
successfully funding education and sports projects in 
Afghanistan. AC has funded 43 school construction projects 
for over 50,000 children and built 50 cricket pitches. We have 
donated $154,000 including funds raised by staff to support 
the construction of Kezer School in the Rustaq district of 
Northern Afghanistan. 
AMREF/ORBIS
Amref Health Africa is one of the leading health NGOs in Africa, 
working to improve the health of women, men and children by 
establishing a participatory health care system. Orbis is an 
international charity that works across Africa, Asia and Latin 
America, transforming lives by preventing and treating 
avoidable blindness and visual impairment. Since 2014 
Euromoney has supported a joint project between Amref Health 
Africa and Orbis to help eliminate trachoma, a preventable 
blinding eye disease, in the South Omo region of Ethiopia. Our 
donations last year and in the coming year will total £100,000. 
Haven House
Haven House is a children’s hospice based on the borders of 
Essex and East London. It looks after children aged from birth to 
19 with life-limiting or life-threatening conditions. Last year, the 
hospice supported 353 children and young people across all its 
services. Euromoney has made a £50,000 contribution to Haven 
House during the last 12 months.
Global efforts
Our staff are engaged globally in our charitable fundraising. 
Our colleagues in New York support a range of local charities 
through initiatives such as helping with meal preparations at 
the Bowery Mission, clothing drives for charities which provide 
disadvantaged men and women with professional office attire, 
hurricane relief fundraisers and volunteer work as part of 
Habitat for Humanity to rehabilitate a home in Battle Hill, 
New York. Our teams in Sofia, Bulgaria carry out fundraising, 
including donations, for the Bulgarian Red Cross and the 
National Fund Saint Nikola, as well as a local hospital for 
children with cerebral palsy.
More to do
The Group’s success is dependent on the efforts of our staff. 
That is not just true in terms of financial results but also our 
ability to serve our communities. We will continue to focus on 
making the Group a place where people want to join and stay 
in part because we are an organisation where they can make 
a difference both inside and outside of the office by leading or 
participating in CSR activities that they care about.

Euromoney AR2017 Strategic-Proof 6.indd   25 12/11/2017   12:13:54 PM Operating and ﬁnancial review
Total revenue and adjusted 
proﬁt before tax are both up, 
despite some headwinds, 
although currency remains 
a favourable tailwind
Following the Group’s decision to review the strategic options 
for the Global Markets Intelligence division (CEIC and EMIS), 
these businesses have met the recognition criteria of 
discontinued operations and therefore have been presented 
as such in the Group’s financial statements. As the division has 
been managed as part of the Group for the full year, its results 
have been included in the Group’s review of its performance. 
Hence, total, adjusted and underlying measures combine the 
results from the Group's continuing and discontinued operations. 
Detailed reconciliations of the Group’s statutory, adjusted and 
underlying results are set out on pages 29 to 32.
Revenue
Total revenue for the year increased by 6% to £428.4m, largely 
due to favourable exchange rates. The Group’s businesses 
focused on price discovery, data and market intelligence 
performed strongly, benefitting from the strategic actions taken 
this year. Despite modest growth in the asset management 
segment during the first half of the year, the increasing cyclical 
headwinds caused by the MiFID II regulations led to its large 
subscription revenues being a significant drag in the second 
half. The commodity events and banking & finance segments, 
which together accounted for 22% of revenues, declined largely 
reflecting the elimination of low-margin events and training 
courses in the first and fourth quarters and the decision not to 
repeat events in certain markets due to increased geopolitical 
instability in the fourth quarter. 
Underlying revenue fell by 1% however, this masks markedly 
varied performances between the quarters. After a 5% decline 
in the first quarters, underlying revenue grew in the second and 
third quarter primarily reflecting a strong recovery in the events 
businesses, particularly in banking and finance and commodities. 
The events performance remained robust in the fourth quarter, 
but was affected by the decision to cut certain events in markets 
affected by increased geopolitical instability. Statutory revenue 
increased by 6% to £386.9m in line with the increase of total 
revenue, including discontinued operations.

Subscriptions and content 
Underlying subscriptions and content revenues increased 
by 1%. Pricing, data & market intelligence subscription revenues 
increased by an underlying 5%, mainly due to an excellent 
performance from Metal Bulletin including the successfully 
integrated FastMarkets, together with strong growth from the 
RISI acquisition in the second half of the year. The increasing 
cost and fee pressures facing the asset management sector 
from the impact of MiFID II resulted in subscription revenues 
from this segment declining 2% on an underlying basis. 
Advertising
The rate of decline in underlying advertising revenues 
decreased during the year, reflecting success in the strategic 
investment in thought-leadership products. However, its 
performance remains weak and declined by 8% year-on-year; 
but it now only represents 10% of total revenue. 
Annual Report and Accounts 2017
26
Euromoney AR2017 Strategic-Proof 6.indd   26 12/11/2017   12:13:54 PM Sponsorship and delegates
Underlying event revenues decreased 3% (sponsorship fell 
by 1% and delegates by 5%), with the banking & finance and 
commodity events segments the most significant reductions. 
However, much of this revenue decline was a direct result of the 
‘self-help’ strategic actions taken in 2016 to consolidate some of 
the Group’s event activities and cut out a significant number of 
low margin events and unprofitable training courses. This has 
improved profitability for both segments and improving market 
conditions led to renewed growth in the second and third 
quarters, and further demonstrated the health of the large 
‘must-attend’ annual events and the strategic focus to continue 
to build large, repeat, high-margin events. 
Adjusted results
The adjusted operating margin fell from 25.2% to 25.0% largely 
due to the required investment in standalone company costs 
following the DMGT sell down and the need to operate as 
an independent group. This drag was partly offset by the 
favourable currency mix. Adjusted operating profit increased 
by 6% to £107.1m. 
Adjusted profit before tax increased by 4% to £106.5m, with 
increased financing costs following the share buyback partly 
offset by an improvement in adjusted profits from the Group’s 
equity interest in associates and joint ventures, principally 
Dealogic. Adjusted diluted earnings per share increased by 15% 
to 76.4p (2016: 66.5p), largely reflecting the benefit from the 
reduced number of shares in issue following the share 
buyback. Underlying adjusted profit before tax fell by 5%.
Statutory results
The statutory profit before tax of £40.7m is lower than the 
adjusted profit before tax due to exceptional items of £31.3m, 
acquired intangible amortisation of £20.6m and a £9.2m 
contribution from discontinued operations. Statutory operating 
profit after acquired intangible amortisation and exceptional 
items increased from £37.3m to £43.4m resulting in a slight 
improvement in the operating margin from 10% to 11%.

The Group recognised a £29.7m impairment charge mostly in 
relation to one of its large asset management businesses, NDR, 
following its disappointing financial performance in the face 
of tough market conditions and management changes in the 
first half.
During the year, the Group sold HedgeFund Intelligence, II 
Intelligence, Euromoney Indices and LatinFinance, resulting in 
a net profit of £3.8m (note 15). The disposal of the joint ventures, 
Institutional Investor Zanbato Limited and EIIZ Discovery LLC, 
resulted in a loss of £0.9m (note 14). 
An element of the provision for overseas sales tax was released 
resulting in a credit of £3.9m, following settlement of the sales 
tax exposure (including interest). 
Restructuring and other exceptional items consist of professional 
fees associated with the share buyback transaction with DMGT; 
professional fees from the legal dispute with the previous 
owners of Centre for Investor Education (CIE), which has been 
treated as exceptional in the prior year; non-recurring costs 
relating to the relocation of the New York office; and costs for 
the acquisition of RISI (note 15). Acquisition costs for smaller 
transactions have not been treated as exceptional consistent 
with the Group's policy. There were no exceptional severance 
costs in 2017.
The exceptional items of £2.4m relating to discontinued 
operations comprise professional fees associated with the 
strategic review of the Global Markets Intelligence division.

• Goodwill and other intangible assets – the movement reflects 
£119.5m of goodwill and acquired intangibles following the 
acquisition of RISI, partially offset by impairment of £27.4m for 
NDR, reclassification of £29.6m of goodwill and acquired 
intangibles to assets held for sale and the unfavourable 
exchange movement from the predominately US dollar 
denominated balance
• Property, plant and equipment – the increase is largely due to 
the New York office fit-out and recurring capital expenditure, 
partly offset by depreciation of £3.0m
• Investments – includes a £2.3m impairment of available-for-sale 
investments, a £1.5m share of loss in Dealogic during 2017 and 
the unfavourable foreign exchange movement from the US dollar 
denominated balance
• Acquisition commitments and deferred consideration – reflects 
addition for the acquisition of Layer123 offset by a credit to the 
Income Statement primarily from the remeasurement of the put 
option liability for NDR's minority stake

Continued
• Deferred income – excluding exchange differences, acquisitions 
and disposals, deferred income increased £6.3m mainly due to 
the recovery in events revenue and an improvement in timing of 
subscriptions invoicing
• Other non-current assets and liabilities – reflects an increase 
in deferred tax liabilities of £20.3m recognised on acquisitions 
during the year, partly offset by the tax effect of NDR goodwill 
impairment of £10.1m. In addition, the Group recognised a £2.5m 
convertible loan note.
• Other current assets and liabilities – the reduction is largely 
due to the £8.7m net reclassification of assets and liabilities to 
held for sale, the settlement of the overseas sales tax exposure 
during the year, a movement of £10.9m on the marked to market 
valuation of short-term derivative contracts and a reduction in 
current income tax liabilities

Closing net (debt)/cash (154.6) 83.8 (238.4)
Net debt at 30 September 2017 was £154.6m compared with net 
debt of £83.6m at 31 March and net cash of £83.8m at last year 
end. The move to a net debt position reflects the share buyback 
completed in early January at a cost of £193.5m, funded by 
£75.3m of the Group’s cash and new bank term-loans of £118.2m. 
It also reflects the acquisitions of RISI and Layer123 in April that 
increased net debt by a further £102.7m and dividend payments 
of £30.8m. This was partly offset by strong operating cash flows 
of £118.2m.
Following the share buyback, the Group arranged new five-year 
external borrowing facilities comprising term-loans of US$100m 
and £40m (total £114.6m) and a £130m multi-currency revolving 
credit facility. There is a further accordion facility of £130m should 
the Group wish to request it. The term-loans and drawings under 
the revolving credit facility bear interest charged at LIBOR plus a 
margin, the applicable margin being based on the Group’s ratio 
of adjusted net debt to EBITDA. At 30 September 2017, the Group’s 
ratio of adjusted net debt to EBITDA was 1.24 times and the 
committed undrawn facility available to the Group was £74.8m.
The Group’s underlying operating cash conversion for the 
12 months to September was 118% (2016: 105%), reflecting better 
working capital management and the recovery in events 
performance.
Currency
The Group generates approximately three-quarters of both its 
revenues, including approximately a third of its UK revenues, 
and approximately 80% of operating profits in US dollars. 
The exposure to US dollar revenues in its UK businesses is 
hedged using forward contracts to sell US dollars, which delays 
the impact of movements in exchange rates for at least a year. 
However, the Group does not hedge the foreign exchange risk 
on the translation of overseas profits. 
The average sterling-US dollar rate for the year to 30 September   
was $1.27 (2016: $1.41). This improved headline revenue growth 
rates for the year by approximately seven percentage points and 
adjusted profit before tax by £9.4m. Each one cent movement 
in the US dollar rate has an impact on profits on translation of 
approximately £0.8m on an annualised basis. The Group also 
translate its non-sterling denominated balance sheet items 
resulting in a loss of £0.4m (2016: £1.9m gain). 
Dividends
Following the DMGT sell down, the Board reviewed the 
Company’s dividend policy. As a result, the Board approved a 
reduction in the dividend cover from 3.0 to 2.5 times adjusted 
earnings, subject to the capital needs of the business. The 15% 
reduction in the number of shares in issues following the share 
buyback, combined with the increase in the dividend pay-out 
ratio, has enabled the Board to approve a 33% increase in 
the final dividend to 21.8p per share (2016: 16.4p), to be paid 
to shareholders on 15 February 2018. This has resulted in a 
total dividend for the year of 30.6p per share (2016: 23.4p).
Treasury 
The treasury department does not act as a profit centre, 
nor does it undertake any speculative trading activity, and it 
operates within policies and procedures approved by the Board. 
In order to hedge its exposure to US dollar revenues in its UK 
businesses, a series of forward contracts are put in place to sell 
forward surplus US dollars. The Group hedges 80% of forecast 
US dollar revenues for the coming 12 months and up to 50% for a 
further six months. As a result of this hedging strategy, any profit 
or loss from the strengthening or weakening of the US dollar will 
largely be delayed until the following financial year and beyond. 
The Group does not hedge the foreign exchange risk on the 
translation of overseas profits. 
The Group’s borrowings are in both sterling and US dollars with 
the related interest tied to LIBOR. It is the Group’s policy to hedge 
up to 80% of its term loan interest exposure, converting its floating 
rate debt into fixed debt by means of interest rate swaps. The 
predictability of interest costs is deemed to be more important 
than the possible opportunity cost foregone of achieving lower 
interest rates. 
Details of the financial instruments used are set out in note 19 to 
the Group's financial statements. 
Annual Report and Accounts 2017
28
Euromoney AR2017 Strategic-Proof 6.indd   28 12/11/2017   12:13:54 PM Tax 
The adjusted effective tax rate based on adjusted profit before 
tax and excluding deferred tax movements on intangible 
assets, prior year items and exceptional items is 19% (2016: 18%). 
The tax rate in each year depends mainly on the geographic mix 
of profits and applicable tax rates. The Group’s statutory effective 
tax rate decreased to 8% compared to 33% in 2016. The Group 
continues to benefit from reductions in the UK corporate tax 
rate and the tax effects of asset acquisitions made in the UK 
prior to July 2015. The rate was further reduced by prior year 
items and a disposal of shares in a subsidiary. 
Significant reconciling items include: non-taxable income of 
£1.6m (2016: £0.4m) that arises from a tax deductible loss on 
disposal of shares in a subsidiary; and other items deductible 
for tax purposes of £5.1m (2016: £5.3m) that results from financing 
arrangements that give rise to asymmetrical tax treatment in 
the territories involved. Prior year items primarily reflect settlement 
of open items with tax authorities in 2017.
The net deferred tax liability held is £21.9m (2016: £10.3m) 
and relates primarily to capitalised intangible assets and tax 
deductible goodwill, net of short-term temporary differences 
and tax losses. The increase in the net deferred tax liability 
relates to a £27.2m liability in respect of acquired goodwill 
and intangibles from the acquisitions of RISI and Layer123 
and deferred tax movements on financial instruments. 
The Group continues to have a number of uncertain tax positions, 
primarily the Canadian and UK exposures which have been 
highlighted in previous periods for which the maximum exposures 
are explained in note 2 of the Group's financial statements.
Headcount 
The number of people employed is monitored monthly to ensure 
there are sufficient resources to meet the forthcoming demands 
of each business and to make sure that the businesses continue 
to deliver sustainable profits. During 2017, the Directors have 
focused on maintaining headcount at a similar level to that in 
2016, hiring new heads only where it was considered essential 
or for investment purposes. Headcount has fallen by 16 since 
September 2016 to 2,228 mainly attributable to the disposals of 
Euromoney Indices, LatinFinance, HedgeFund Intelligence and 
II Intelligence and profit protection measures undertaken in the 
asset management segment, offset by the acquisitions of RISI 
and Layer123.
Adjusted measures 
The Directors believe that the adjusted measures provide 
additional useful information for shareholders to evaluate 
and compare the performance of the business from period 
to period. These measures are used by management for 
budgeting, planning and monthly reporting purposes and are 
the basis on which executive management is incentivised.  
The non-IFRS measures also enable the Group to track more 
easily and consistently the underlying operational performance 
by separating out the following types of exceptional income, 
charges and non-cash items.
Total revenue represents the combined reported revenue from 
continuing and discontinued operations.
Adjusted earnings include the results of continuing and 
discontinued operations. The discontinued operations for 
the Global Markets Intelligence division have been included 
in the adjusted results as it was owned and managed as part 
of the Group for the entire period and to aid year-on-year 
comparability of the Group's results. 
Adjusted figures are presented before the impact of 
amortisation of acquired intangible assets (comprising 
trademarks and brands, databases and customer relationships), 
exceptional items, share of associates’ and joint ventures’ 
acquired intangibles amortisation, exceptional items and 
tax, and net movements in deferred consideration and 
acquisition commitments. 
The amortisation of acquired intangible assets is adjusted as 
the premium paid relative to the net assets on the balance sheet 
of the acquired business and is classified as either goodwill 
or as an intangible asset arising on a business combination 
and is recognised on the Group’s balance sheet. This differs 
to organically developed businesses where assets such as 
employee talent and customer relationships are not recognised 
on the balance sheet. Impairment and amortisation of 
intangible assets and goodwill arising on acquisitions are 
excluded from adjusted results as they are balance sheet items 
that relate to historical M&A activity rather than the trading 
performance of the business. 
Exceptional items are items of income or expense considered by 
the Directors, either individually or if a similar type in aggregate 
as being significant. The accounting policy for exceptional items 
can be found in note 1 to the Group's financial statements.
Adjusted share of results in associates and joint ventures 
excludes the share of exceptional items that relates to 
restructuring and earn-out costs in Dealogic. IFRS requires 
that earn-out payments to selling shareholders retained in the 
acquired business for a contractual time period are treated as a 
compensation cost. Given that these payments are in substance 
part of the cost of an investment and will not recur once the 
earn-out payments have been made, they have been excluded 
from the share of adjusted profit.
In respect of earnings, adjusted amounts reflect a tax rate that 
includes the current tax effect of the goodwill and intangible 
assets. Many of the Group’s acquisitions, particularly in the US, 
give rise to significant tax savings as the amortisation of 
goodwill and intangible assets on acquisition is deductible for 
tax purposes. The Group considers that the resulting adjusted 
effective tax rate is therefore more representative of its tax 
payable position. 
Further analysis of the adjusting items is presented in notes 3, 5, 
7, 8, 12 and 14 to the Group's financial statements.
The Group has consistently applied this definition of adjusted 
measures as it has reported on its financial performance in the 
past and it is the Group’s intention to continue to consistently 
apply this definition in the future.

When assessing the performance of our businesses, the Board 
considers the adjusted results. The year-on-year change in 
adjusted results may not, however, be a fair like-for-like 
comparison as there are a number of factors which can 
influence growth rates but which do not reflect underlying 
performance.
When calculating underlying growth, adjustments are made 
to give a like-for-like comparison. For example, the adjusted 
results in 2017 benefitted from the strengthening of the US dollar 
relative to sterling. To calculate underlying growth, the prior 
year comparatives are restated using 2017 exchange rates. 
Similarly, adjustments are made to exclude disposals from 
both years. When businesses are acquired, the prior year 
comparatives are adjusted to include the acquisition. The timing 
of events can also be a distortion. To give a fair like-for-like 
comparison when calculating underlying growth, significant 
timing event differences are excluded from the year in which 
they were held.
The Group’s adjusted and underlying measures should not be 
considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial 
information presented in compliance with IFRS. The adjusted 
and underlying measures used by the Group are not necessarily 
comparable with those used by other companies.

The underlying basis is after adjusting for significant timing differences affecting the movement on working capital and exceptional 
items. For the year ended 30 September 2017, exceptional items largely consist of cash payments for the 2016 restructuring costs, 
legal and professional fees and share buyback costs. The other working capital movements are largely the result of the landlord’s 
contribution to the fit-out of the New York office which will be amortised over the period of the lease and the rent-free period of the 
London and New York offices. For the year ended 30 September 2016, exceptional payments related to the strategic review in 2016 
and the development of the Group’s new strategy. The other working capital movements in prior year related to the rent-free period 
of the London offices. 
As cash generated from operations in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows includes those from discontinued operations, we have 
not provided the statutory cash conversion rate as it would not give a fair indication of the Group's cash conversion performance.

The bank covenant ratio uses an average exchange rate in the calculation of net debt and includes an annualised adjustment 
attributable to acquisitions and disposals in the calculation of adjusted EBITDA. When businesses are acquired after the beginning 
of the financial year, the calculation of adjusted EBITDA includes EBITDA attributable to the business as if the acquisition had been 
completed on the first day of the financial year. The calculation excludes the EBITDA of any businesses disposed of during the year.

Euromoney AR2017 Strategic-Proof 6.indd   32 12/11/2017   12:13:55 PM Risk management
We are placing an increased 
focus on the management of risk, 
as well as the reporting of risk
The Board and Risk Committee note that, of the principal risks 
identified in the previous financial year, the structural shifts 
being seen in the asset management sector, one of the four 
segments, pose the most significant operational risk and the 
most challenging risk to manage. The Board wishes to continue 
to serve the asset management segment because it considers it 
to be attractive over the medium term.
The Risk Committee has completed a robust and detailed 
assessment of both the risk management processes and the 
risk register and has considered the impact of significant risks 
to the Group. Further details of the risk management processes, 
the governance structure for risk and the Risk Committee can 
be found in the Governance section.
We use a number of tools to analyse risks and facilitate 
discussions at the Board, Group Management Board and Risk 
Committee. The risk matrix below shows the relative impact 
and likelihood of the principal risks. The risks are shown as 
post-mitigation, residual risks. We also consider the extent to 
which each risk arises from external or internal factors, and 
whether each risk is established and understood or is an 
emerging risk and therefore less well understood. The risk 
radar below maps the principal risks using this criteria, 
with increasing risk indicated by the larger data points. 
Arrows are used to indicate directional movement.
The principal risks and uncertainties the Group faces vary 
across its different businesses and are identified in the risk 
register. Management of significant risk is the responsibility 
of the Board and is overseen by the Risk Committee. The Risk 
Committee changed its terms of reference during the year 
both to reflect market practice and to introduce an express 
requirement for the Committee to focus on the management 
of risk, as well as the identification and reporting of risk. 
The membership of the Committee changed during the year 
with the General Counsel & Company Secretary and Chief 
Information Officer joining the Committee.
The Group’s risk register identifies the principal risks facing the 
business. The register is put together following a Group-wide 
assessment of risks reported in its business risk registers 
(bottom-up approach). Each business risk register considers 
the likelihood of a risk occurring and both the monetary 
and reputational impact of the risk crystallising. The risk 
assessment process also considers the appetite for the risk 
(top-down approach).
The Group registers its risks based on a residual risk rating after taking 
account of mitigating controls.

DOWNTURN IN KEY GEOGRAPHIC REGION OR MARKET SECTOR (CYCLICAL DOWNTURN)
• Concentration of customers 
in financial services sector 
makes this exposure acute
• Economic or geopolitical 
uncertainty increases this risk
• The asset management sector faces 
significant structural headwinds 
such as the shift from active to 
passive portfolio management, 
new technologies and the uncertain 
impact of new regulation (MiFID II)
• Brexit continues to create 
uncertainty for the UK and 
European markets
Board’s view
The Board wishes to continue to serve the 
asset management segment because it 
considers it to be attractive over the 
medium term. There are limited options to 
mitigate impact in the short and medium 
term from a significant cyclical downturn. 
The residual risk will remain high.
• The Group actively manages cyclical risk 
through its strategic framework
• A comprehensive risk review by the Group 
of its asset management businesses 
resulting in output including detailed 
mitigation plans for each business and 
continuous tracking of effective risk 
management
• The Group operates in many 
geographical markets 
• Some diversification in sector mix
• Ability to cut some costs temporarily 
and quickly
• Events can be switched to better 
performing regions

PRODUCT AND MARKET TRANSFORMATION/DISRUPTION (STRUCTURAL CHANGE)
• Competition from existing 
competitors, new disruptive 
players and new entrants
• New technologies change how 
customers access and use 
our products
• Changing demographics can affect 
customer needs and opportunities
• Structural pressure on customer 
business models will affect 
demand for the Group’s products 
and services particularly in 
financial services
• New regulations such as MiFID II 
creating both challenges and 
opportunities in asset 
management sector
• Free content available via the 
Internet increases the threat to 
paid subscription model
• Lower barriers to entry for 
new entrants
• Inability to acquire the types of 
assets that the Group's strategy 
requires
Board’s view
High-quality controls are in place 
but exposure to this risk cannot be 
entirely mitigated. 
• Strategy designed to appraise and 
evaluate structural risks and respond to 
them, taking advantage of opportunities 
where identified 
• Regular CEO-led reviews across 
all divisions
• Entrepreneurial approach
• Effective management reporting with 
regular budget reviews
• Portfolio spreads risk to some degree
• Third of Group’s profits remain  
event-based
• Portfolio management allows the 
Group to sell structurally challenged 
businesses and to buy structurally 
strong ones
• Introduction of a cyclical review of 
divisional activities by the Risk Committee

EXPOSURE TO US DOLLAR EXCHANGE RATE
• Approximately three-quarters 
of revenues and profits are 
generated in US dollars, including 
approximately 30% of the revenues 
in its UK-based businesses. 
This gives significant exposure 
to movements in the US dollar 
for both UK revenues and the 
translation of results of foreign 
subsidiaries
• A significant strengthening of 
sterling against the US dollar 
could reduce profits and dividends
• The Group also undertakes 
transactions in many other 
currencies, although none 
currently provides a significant 
risk to the results
Board’s view
The risk to revenue and profit resulting from 
a depreciation of the US dollar against 
sterling has previously been reported 
within risks from treasury operations. 
Although the Group considers this risk 
unchanged, the increased volatility and 
uncertainty of sterling after Brexit, as well 
as the US dollar following the US election, 
is expected to continue for some time.
• US dollar forward contracts are used 
to hedge 80% of UK based US dollar 
revenues for the coming 12 months 
and 50% of these revenues for a further 
six months
• Exposure from the translation of  
US dollar-denominated earnings is not 
directly hedged but is partially offset 
by US dollar costs and the use of 
US dollar-denominated debt
• Sensitivity analysis is performed 
regularly to assess the impact of 
currency risk, and is reviewed by the 
Tax & Treasury Committee

INFORMATION SECURITY BREACH RESULTING IN CHALLENGE TO DATA INTEGRITY
• Integrity of data products is 
fundamental to the success of 
the business
• The Group relies on large quantities 
of data including customer, 
employee and commercial data 
• Increasing number of cyber-attacks 
affecting organisations globally 
• The Group has many websites and 
is reliant on distributed technology, 
increasing exposure to threats 
• A successful cyber-attack could 
cause considerable disruption 
to business operations, lost 
revenue, regulatory fines 
and reputational damage
• The new EU General Data 
Protection Regulation will increase 
regulatory scrutiny and penalties
• Technological innovations in mobile 
working, cloud-based technologies 
and social media introduce new 
information security risks
Board’s view
Controls to prevent an information security 
breach or cyber-attack are regularly 
enhanced. However, the rising number 
of cyber-attacks affecting organisations 
globally, the Group’s greater dependency 
on technology and the growing threat from 
cyber-crime are increasing this risk.
• Governance provided by Risk Committee 
and Information Security Steering Group
• New information security standards 
and policies which are reviewed on 
a regular basis
• Active information security programme 
(including access management and 
cyber-resilience planning) to align all 
parts of the Group with its information 
security standards 
• Crisis management and business continuity 
framework covers all businesses including 
disaster recovery planning for IT systems
• IT controls including firewalls and intrusion 
detection software
• Access to key systems and data is 
restricted, monitored and logged with 
auditable data trails in place
• Comprehensive backups for IT 
infrastructure, systems and business data
• Creation of Group Chief Information Officer 
role and appointment of expert individual 
into role with responsibility for and 
oversight of both central and divisional 
technology functions
• Professional indemnity insurance provides 
cover for cyber risks including cyber-attack 
and data breach incidents 
• Information security is reviewed as part of 
our internal audit process
• Annual information security training for 
employees and freelancers

REPUTATIONAL DAMAGE FROM A LEGAL, REGULATORY OR BEHAVIOURAL ISSUE  
ARISING FROM OPERATIONAL ACTIVITIES
• The Group operates in many 
jurisdictions and must be compliant 
with all applicable laws and 
regulations
• The Group’s businesses publish, 
market and license increasingly 
complex content and data which in 
some cases is data on which its 
customers may choose to rely when 
executing transactions
• Claimants can forum shop when 
determining where to litigate or 
threaten legal proceedings
• Success of the Group is dependent 
on client confidence in integrity of 
products and brands
• Compliance risk increasing for 
information providers as price, 
benchmark and index reporting 
activities are coming into scope of 
new regulations being introduced 
as a result of the financial crisis of 
2008 and LIBOR scandal
• Risk or reputational damage can 
arise from errors in underlying data 
or content, failures of data integrity, 
failure to educate customers on 
appropriate usage of data, 
inappropriate reliance on third 
party data or content to create 
proprietary content or errors in 
content creation or a failure to comply 
with applicable law or regulation
• Processes and methodologies for assessing 
commodity prices and calculating 
benchmarks and indices are clearly 
defined and documented
• Compliance staff appointed in key positions
• Compliance with International 
Organization of Securities Commissions 
(IOSCO) standards achieved for relevant 
pricing products
• Code of conduct and other key policies in 
place for price assessment, benchmark 
and index reporting activities
• Updated publishing law guide to be issued 
to editorial staff in 2018
• Refreshed anti-bribery and corruption 
training and awareness programme to be 
rolled out globally in 2018
• Review processes for operation of events 
and awards
• Specialist training provided to relevant staff
• New technology being introduced to 
provide enhanced monitoring and better 
exception reporting 
• Company-wide speak up policy in place
• Comprehensive legal disclaimers in place
• Professional indemnity insurance
• Risk and compliance role recruited in Price 
Reporting and Events divisions

which customers may

business decisions
2
Board’s view
The publication of data and content in digital 
businesses inevitably exposes the Group to global 
legal and regulatory risk. The manner in which 
we conduct our businesses can also result in risk 
if policies are not complied with. The business 
has invested in its central functions such as legal, 
risk and internal audit, which provide more 
specialist resource to raise awareness of, 
manage and mitigate risk. Legal and regulatory 
compliance risk for the Group is unchanged.
DISRUPTION TO BUSINESS OPERATIONS
• Significant reliance on third-party 
technology hosting services
• Many products are dependent on 
specialist, technical and editorial 
expertise
• A significant incident affecting one 
or more of the Company’s key offices 
(London, New York, Montreal, 
Hong Kong or Sofia) could lead to 
disruption to Group operations and 
reputational damage
• Divisional structure with 40+ 
international offices makes regular 
testing of plans across the Group 
challenging
• Global distribution of property and 
staff creates exposure in many 
geographical locations
• Crisis management and business 
continuity framework covers all businesses 
including disaster recovery planning for IT 
systems 
• Group-wide ITDR testing conducted every 
six months
• Clear responsibilities for business 
continuity planning established across 
divisions
• Substantial central and business group 
investment in cloud based platforms and 
software
• Risk assessments for new suppliers and 
technologies consider operational and 
financial resilience

Business disruption is an unavoidable risk but can be mitigated if business continuity plans are well 
developed and managed. In spite of extreme weather in Asia and the US, and a number of system 
failures, all businesses maintained operations successfully throughout, which demonstrated that 
effective controls are in place. However, more regular business continuity planning is required.

CATASTROPHIC OR HIGH IMPACT INCIDENT AFFECTING KEY EVENTS OR WIDER BUSINESS
• The Group has a number of large 
events which are exposed to one-off 
risks including natural hazards and 
security incidents
• Risk affects customers as well as 
staff and revenue 
• Prolonged interruption to business 
travel will harm event revenues and 
disrupt management and sales 
operations
• Past incidents such as hurricanes, 
terrorist attacks, SARS, Ebola and 
Zika virus, and events such as the 
disruption to airline schedules from 
volcanic ash in Europe, have all had 
a negative impact on the Group’s 
results, although none materially
• The Group operates in regions with 
higher risk of natural hazards
• Crisis management and business 
continuity framework requires all 
businesses to plan for high impact events
• Specialist security and medical assistance 
services engaged to support all staff 
working away from the office
• New event venue risk assessment process 
was introduced in 2017
• Mandatory security and risk management 
training programme for event staff and 
business travellers
• With sufficient notice, events can be 
moved to non-affected regions
• Cancellation insurance for the Group's 
largest events

travelling and to improve event/conference resilience.
ACQUISITION OR DISPOSAL FAILS TO GENERATE EXPECTED RETURNS
• Active portfolio management 
means the Group continues to make 
strategic acquisitions and disposals
• Significant growth has been 
M&A related, through both 
acquired profit and growth in 
acquired businesses
• Failure to integrate may mean 
an acquired business does not 
generate the expected returns
• Risk of impairment loss if an 
acquired business does not 
generate the expected returns
• Disposal risks arise from failing 
to identify the time at which 
businesses should be sold or 
failing to achieve optimal price
• Group strategy relies on successful 
recycling of capital and therefore 
M&A execution impacts core 
strategy
Board’s view
This risk will increase given the Group's 
strategy of increased M&A and portfolio 
management.
• Active portfolio management with a 
clear framework and operating in line 
with agreed strategy
• Development of key objective criteria 
against which acquisition or disposal 
decisions are tested
• Board and CEO focus on investment 
and divestment plans. Formal reviews 
and approvals in place
• Senior head of Corporate Development 
in place recently supplemented by 
additional industry hire with both subject 
matter and industry expertise
• Investment in external, independent 
commercial due diligence
• The Group has developed a rigorous 
framework to manage the integration, 
planning and ownership of new 
acquisitions

UNFORESEEN TAX LIABILITIES OR LOSSES FROM TREASURY OPERATIONS
• The Group operates within 
many increasingly complex 
tax jurisdictions
• Counterparty risk if a bank fails
• Cash and working capital 
requirements for multiple 
overseas locations mean some 
debt is always exposed to 
exchange rate movements
Board’s view
Effective controls are in place but the 
Group cannot eliminate this risk entirely 
due to the complexity of the Group’s 
structure and the number of jurisdictions 
in which it operates.
• Audit Committee and Tax & Treasury 
Committee oversight
• Tax and treasury advice provided 
by a mix of external tax experts and  
in-house specialists
• We have a policy to comply with tax laws 
in a responsible manner and have open 
and constructive relationships with tax 
authorities
• We take appropriate care to protect the 
Group’s reputation and relationship with 
fiscal authorities
• We take regulatory and commercial 
constraints into account when taking 
steps to mitigate tax exposure
• Derivatives are used to hedge market 
risks including exchange rates and 
interest rates
• Appropriate policies define segregation 
of duties and strict authorisation limits
• Internal audit programme covers tax

FAILURE TO IMPLEMENT THE STRATEGY EFFECTIVELY DUE TO A LOSS OF KEY STAFF
• In 2016 the Group announced a 
new strategy which has become 
embedded across the Group 
and is having a positive impact 
on financial performance
• Our segments and divisions have 
individual strategies
• Implementation of strategy is 
dependent on the performance 
of staff in critical roles 
• An inability to recruit, retain and 
train for critical roles will adversely 
impact our ability to deliver the 
strategy successfully 
• Ensuring compensation is competitive 
• Ensuring compensation for critical staff 
includes a balance of short-term and 
long-term incentives
• Investment in training and developing our 
staff in critical roles will be a focus in 2018
• Maintaining the Group’s reputation for 
enabling an entrepreneurial approach, 
making the Company an attractive place 
to work
• There are sufficient businesses within 
each segment and segments within the 
Group to mitigate the impact of ‘business-
as-usual’ departures of critical staff
• Succession plans are being developed 
but this work needs to accelerate
• Contractual notice periods are designed

Euromoney AR2017 Strategic-Proof 6.indd   38 12/11/2017   12:13:57 PM Viability Statement
In accordance with provision C.2.2 of the UK Corporate 
Governance Code 2016, the Directors have assessed the 
viability of the Group and have selected a period of three 
years for the assessment.
The three-year forecasting horizon has been selected 
because the Directors believe there is sufficient, realistic 
visibility available to assess the Group’s current and anticipated 
operating environment and market conditions over this period. 
The three-year period is also used for the Group’s strategic 
planning cycle and is therefore considered an appropriate 
period for the long-term viability statement. 
The assessment conducted considered the Group’s operating 
profit, revenue, cash flows, dividend cover and other key 
financial ratios over the three-year period. These metrics 
were subject to severe downside stress and sensitivity analysis 
over the assessment period, taking account of the Group’s 
current position, the Group’s experience of managing adverse 
conditions in the past and the impact of a number of severe yet 
plausible scenarios, based on the principal risks set out in the 
Strategic Report. The stress testing considered the principal 
risks which were assessed to have the highest probability of 
occurrence or the most severe impact, crystallising both 
individually and in combination. In making the statement, 
the Directors have applied the following key scenarios:
• The asset management segment is increasingly affected 
by uncertainty from MiFID II and the structural shift towards 
passive management and leading to a significant decline 
in our subscription revenues
• The pricing, data & market intelligence segment suffers a 
downturn due to the reputational fall-out from inaccuracies 
in one of its reporting indexes, with a significant fall in 
subscription revenues
• Significant reversal of the foreign exchange movement since 
Brexit adversely impacts the financial results of the Group
• It is assumed that all material open tax items as detailed in 
note 2 of the Group's financial statements will result in the 
maximum cash outflow
The Directors have also modelled an extreme scenario that 
combines the scenarios with a number of other risks that are 
deemed to have a lower probability of occurrence or lower 
impact to assess the viability of the Group.
In making the assessment, the Directors have considered the 
Group’s robust capital position, the cash-generative nature of 
the business, the visibility of subscriptions revenue, the ability 
of the Company to cut costs quickly, the access to available 
credit, the absence of significant pension and M&A liabilities 
and the Group’s ability to restrict dividends. Based on the 
results of this analysis, the Directors confirm that they have a 
reasonable expectation that the Group will be able to continue 
in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due over the 
three-year period under review.

AS A COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE
Our price-reporting division uses 
compliance and standards to create 
competitive advantage. Over the last two 
years, Metal Bulletin has developed and 
implemented its MInD database, which 
manages and stores the data collected by 
our price reporters. This year, through a 
combination of documentation, controls 
and monitoring, Metal Bulletin achieved 
International Organization of Securities 
Commissions (IOSCO) compliance. The 
Group’s auditors, PwC, provided assurance 
that the policies, processes and controls 
that Metal Bulletin Group have designed 
and implemented comply with the IOSCO 
Principles for Oil Price Reporting Agencies. 
This compliance process is an important 
step in our Price Reporting & Analytics 
division’s transition towards becoming a 
price reporting agency.

Euromoney AR2017 Governance-Proof 6.indd   43 12/11/2017   11:48:25 AM Corporate Governance Report
Statement of compliance
The Company continues substantially to comply with the Code.
Daily Mail General Trust plc (DMGT) has ceased to be the 
Company’s majority shareholder but remains a significant 
shareholder in the Company and retains two Non-Executive 
positions on the Board which are not regarded as independent 
under the Code. The Company’s founder, president and 
ex-chairman, Sir Patrick Sergeant, remains on the Board but 
is not regarded as an independent Director under the Code. 
The Company therefore did not comply throughout the financial 
year ended 30 September 2017 with certain provisions of the 
Code as set out below. The Company is making significant 
progress, including through changes made in 2017, to bring 
its Board and committee structure more in line with Code 
requirements. For example: since 2015, the majority of our Board 
has comprised Non-Executive Directors. A number of changes 
have been made during the financial year: the Board appointed 
a Senior Independent Director; the CEO and a Non-Executive 
Director resigned from the Nominations Committee; a new 
Group Management Board was created; the Company has 
recently announced the appointment of three new, independent 
Non-Executive Directors, one of whom is expected to take on 
the role of Chairman of the Remuneration Committee after a 
suitable period; and following the decision of our Chairman, 
John Botts, to retire after our next AGM, we have announced our 
intention to commence a search for a new, independent Director 
to appoint as Chairman; the Nominations Committee has also 
appointed a search firm with a view to hiring a new Chairman 
of the Audit Committee.
This Corporate Governance Report explains how the Company has applied the main principles of the UK Corporate 
Governance Code (the ‘Code’). We have used the key themes of the Code as a framework:
 Leadership and effectiveness are on pages 46 to 50.
  Accountability: The reports of the Audit and Risk Committees are set out on pages 50 to 53.
 Relations with shareholders on page 53.
  Remuneration is covered in the Directors’ Remuneration Report on pages 58 to 73. 
Annual Report and Accounts 2017
44
Euromoney AR2017 Governance-Proof 6.indd   44 12/11/2017   11:48:25 AM These changes will provide the Board with the ability to alter the composition of certain of its committees in due course in order to 
achieve greater alignment with the Code. 
Provision Code principle Explanation of non-compliance
A.3.1 Appointment of the 
Chairman
John Botts did not meet the Code’s definition of independence on appointment as 
Chairman due to his length of service. However the Board believes that his length 
of service has enhanced his role as a Non-Executive Director. The Board intends to 
appoint a new independent Director to serve as Chairman.
B.1.2 Composition of the 
Board
Less than half the Board are independent Non-Executive Directors. However, there 
are clear divisions of responsibility within the Board such that no one individual 
has unfettered powers of decision. The Company reduced the number of Executive 
Directors following the 2015 AGM and the changes described on page 44 illustrate 
that the Company is making progress to achieve its aim of being more in line 
with Code requirements in the near term in relation to the number of independent 
Non-Executive Directors (the number of independent Non-Executive Directors is 
now four compared to three in 2016 with an additional two new independent  
Non-Executive Directors joining the Board in the coming months).
B.2.1 Composition of 
the Nominations 
Committee
The Nominations Committee does not comprise a majority of independent Non-
Executive Directors. The Committee now comprises five Non-Executive Directors 
(increased from three in 2016), including two considered independent under the 
Code (compared to no independent directors in 2016). All are considered by the 
Board to be the most appropriate members.
B.3.2 Terms and conditions 
of appointment 
of Non-Executive 
Directors
John Botts, David Pritchard, Andrew Ballingal, Tristan Hillgarth and Imogen 
Joss have terms and conditions of appointment. The Viscount Rothermere, Paul 
Zwillenberg and Sir Patrick Sergeant operate under the terms of their employment 
contracts with DMGT and Euromoney respectively.
C.3.1 Composition of the 
Audit Committee
The Audit Committee does not comprise at least three independent Non-
Executive Directors. The Committee comprises three members, only two of whom 
are considered independent under the Code; the other is the Chairman of the 
Company who is considered by the Board to be a valuable and independently-
minded member of the Committee. Since the resignation of Stephen Daintith, who 
represented DMGT on the Committee, the Committee has lacked a member with 
recent and relevant financial experience. The Company has mitigated this impact 
through reliance on internal and external expertise and DMGT’s current CFO, who 
possesses the requisite experience, joined the Committee on 21 November 2017.
C.3.2 Risk Committee 
approach
The Risk Committee does not comprise at least three independent Non-Executive 
Directors. The Committee comprises six members, none of whom is considered 
independent under the Code. David Pritchard as Chairman of the Audit Committee 
and independent Non-Executive Director is invited to attend all meetings of 
the Committee. The role and responsibilities of the Risk Committee, including 
its membership, are considered appropriate and well suited to reviewing the 
Company’s risk management approach. The Risk Committee and the Audit 
Committee work collaboratively and include members or attendees common to 
both committees, to ensure that the principles of the Code are achieved within 
this structure.
D.2.1 Composition and 
chairmanship of 
the Remuneration 
Committee
The Remuneration Committee does not comprise at least three independent 
Non-Executive Directors. The Committee comprises three Non-Executive Directors, 
only one of whom is considered independent under the Code and one is the 
Chairman of the Company. The Company has announced the appointment of an 
independent Non-Executive Director who is expected to become Chairman of the 
Remuneration Committee.
E.1.1 Dialogue with 
shareholders
David Pritchard, the Company’s Senior Independent Director, was appointed in 
January and is scheduled to have his first investor meetings in November 2017.

Euromoney AR2017 Governance-Proof 6.indd   46 12/11/2017   11:48:25 AM Board composition and roles
During the financial year the Board comprised a Non-Executive Chairman, two Executive Directors and six Non-Executive Directors. 
There are clear divisions of responsibility within the Board such that no one individual has unfettered powers of decision. There is 
a procedure for all Directors in the furtherance of their duties to take independent professional advice, at the Company’s expense. 
They also have access to the advice and services of the Company Secretary. Their key responsibilities are set out in the table below:
Executive Directors
CEO Andrew Rashbass Strategy and Group performance
Finance Director Colin Jones Group financial and operational performance
Non-Executive Director
Chairman John Botts Board governance and performance and shareholder engagement.
President Sir Patrick Sergeant As founder and president of the 
Company, his insight and external 
contacts remain valuable to 
the Company.
Support and constructively 
challenge the executive 
Directors using their broad 
range of experience and 
expertise. Monitor the 
delivery of the agreed 
strategy within the risk 
management framework 
set by the Board.
Independent  
Non-Executive Directors
David Pritchard,  
Andrew Ballingal,  
Tristan Hillgarth
Bring an external perspective,  
sound judgement and objectivity  
to the Board’s deliberations and 
decision-making.
Non-Executive Directors, 
also directors of DMGT
The Viscount Rothermere,  
Paul Zwillenberg
Bring the views of the Company’s 
largest shareholder to the Board.
Independence
The Board has determined that David Pritchard (Senior 
Independent Director), Andrew Ballingal and Tristan Hillgarth 
are independent within the meaning of the Code. John Botts has 
been on the Board for more than the recommended term of nine 
years under the Code and the Board believes that his length of 
service enhances his role as a Non-Executive Director and that 
he remains independently-minded. However, due to his length 
of service, John Botts was not considered to be independent at 
the time of his appointment. Sir Patrick Sergeant has served on 
the Board in various roles since founding the Company in 1969 
and has been a Non-Executive Director since 1992. Due to his 
length of service, Sir Patrick Sergeant is not considered to be 
independent.
The Viscount Rothermere and Paul Zwillenberg are also 
Executive Directors of DMGT, a significant shareholder of the 
Company. These Directors bring valuable experience and 
advice to the Company, although have no involvement in the 
day-to-day management of the Company and the Board does 
not believe these Non-Executive Directors are able to exert 
undue influence on decisions taken by the Board, nor does 
it consider their independence or objectivity to be impaired 
by their positions with DMGT. However, their relationship with 
DMGT as a significant shareholder in the Company means 
they are not considered to be independent.
Effectiveness
The Code requires an externally facilitated evaluation of the 
Board to be concluded every three years. This was conducted 
during the year and externally facilitated by Independent Audit 
Limited using their online assessment service. Independent 
Audit Limited has no connection with the Company. The scope 
of the review included both the Board and its main Committees. 
The evaluation indicated that the effectiveness of the Board 
has improved since progress has been made in the course 
of the changes taking place at the Company since the 
appointment of Andrew Rashbass as CEO in October 2015 when 
the roles of CEO and Chairman were split and most Executive 
Directors resigned from the Board. The review highlighted areas 
for the Board to continue focusing on. Areas for development 
which were identified in this year’s evaluation process were: 
the Company’s approach to succession planning; Board 
composition, including diversity; and Board communications. 
The Board is exploring ways to improve its performance in 
these areas. The Senior Independent Director separately 
co-ordinated a review of the performance of the Chairman.

Board meetings and attendance
The Board meets six times each year at least every two months and there is frequent contact between meetings. At least once 
a year, the Company’s Chairman meets the Non-Executive Directors without the other Executive Directors being present. The 
Non-Executive Directors either meet together or individually with the Company’s Senior Independent Director, in both cases without 
the Company’s Chairman present, at least annually to appraise the Chairman’s performance and on other occasions as necessary.
Non-Executive Directors are also encouraged to meet senior management in the business without the Executive Directors present 
in order to have access to a range of views and perspectives on the Company and its operation.
The number of Board and Committee meetings and their attendance by each Director during the year was as follows:

Monitoring and oversight 
Fair, balanced and understandable
The Directors have responsibility for preparing the 2017 Annual 
Report and Accounts and for making certain confirmations 
concerning it. In accordance with the Code provision C.1.1 the 
Board confirms that, taken as a whole, the 2017 Annual Report 
and Accounts is fair, balanced and understandable and 
provides the information necessary for shareholders to assess 
the Company’s position and performance, business model and 
strategy. The Board reached this conclusion after receiving 
advice from the Audit Committee.
Internal control and risk management 
  See pages 34 to 38 for the Group’s principal risks and 
mitigating actions
The Board as a whole is responsible for the oversight of risk, the 
Group’s system of internal control and reviewing its effectiveness. 
The Company aims to manage rather than eliminate risk and 
can only provide reasonable and not absolute assurance 
against material misstatement or loss. The Board has 
implemented a continuing process for identifying, evaluating 
and managing the material risks faced by the Group. The Board 
has delegated the day-to-day responsibility for internal controls 
and financial risk to the Audit Committee and for operational 
risk to the Risk Committee. 
The Directors completed a review of the effectiveness of the 
Group’s system of risk management and internal controls 
covering all material controls, including financial, operational 
and compliance controls. The majority of controls operated 
throughout the year, though some additional controls were 
implemented during the year. The review did not identify any 
significant weaknesses or failings in the system of internal 
control and risk management. The Company is taking action to 
address any weaknesses or failings identified during the course 
of the review.
The controls to prevent an information security breach or 
cyber-attack are regularly reviewed and where appropriate 
updated. Cyber and other information security risks are 
increasing and the mitigation of these risks continues to be 
a focus for the Risk Committee and the Board. 
The diverse range of products and the many geographic 
markets that the Group operates in makes regular testing of 
business continuity plans a challenge. The Group is committed 
to improving its testing regime including rolling out and 
enhanced testing programme.
The Board has established procedures to ensure effective 
internal control. These have been in place throughout the year 
and up to the date of this report, are as follows: 
The Board of Directors 
The Board has overall responsibility for the Group and there is a 
formal schedule of matters specifically reserved for decision by 
the Board. The Board: 
• reviews and assesses the Group’s principal risks and 
uncertainties at least annually and has performed a robust 
assessment of those principal risks
• seeks assurance that effective control is being maintained 
through regular reports from divisional management, 
the Risk and Audit committees and various independent 
monitoring functions
• approves the annual budget after performing a review of key 
risk factors. Performance is monitored regularly by way of 
variances and key performance indicators to enable relevant 
action to be taken and forecasts are updated each quarter. The 
Board considers longer-term financial projections as part of its 
regular discussions on the Group’s strategy and funding 
requirements and
• approves proposals for investments and capital expenditure 
beyond specified limits
Risk and Audit Committee
The Board has determined that having separate Audit and Risk 
Committees, with specific terms of reference, is useful to provide 
challenge and review across the range of businesses the 
Group operates.
The terms of reference for the Risk Committee were revised and 
changes agreed at the Risk Committee meeting in March 2017 
to ensure greater focus on the management not just the 
reporting of risk. An example of this is the Risk Committee’s 
active participation in directing risk reviews and mitigation 
planning related to the changes in the asset management 
segment affecting some areas of the Group.
The Audit, Risk and Remuneration Committees are made of 
members who possess the requisite skills and experience to 
allow each Committee to meet its obligation and to provide the 
relevant assurance to the Board. The Committees collaborate 
with one another and each is attended by at least one member 
from the other Committees. This ensures that matters of mutual 
interest raised in any of the three Committees are discussed in 
the others and actioned in the operating businesses. 
Entity level controls
Each segment, division or function is responsible for managing 
risks and operating controls within their area. Each division 
confirms the operation of key controls (including with 
management) to central management annually. The purpose 
of the assessment is to confirm the operation of a framework 
of internal controls, including anti-fraud controls, which are 
expected to be in place in each business unit. They are intended 
to provide standards against which the control environments of 
the Group’s business units can be monitored. An annual bribery 
and fraud risk assessment is completed at the same time, 
detailing risks and mitigating controls. In each case, the central 
management team follows-up these submissions as appropriate.

The Group Management Board meets monthly to discuss 
strategic, operational and financial issues. The Group’s tax, 
financing and foreign exchange positions are overseen by 
the Tax and Treasury Committee. Controls and procedures 
over the security of data and disaster recovery are periodically 
reviewed and are subject to internal audit. Accounting controls 
and procedures are regularly reviewed and communicated 
throughout the Group. Attention is paid to authorisation levels 
and segregation of duties.
Internal audit 
The Group has invested in its own internal audit department 
which is described on page 52. The department works closely 
with the Company’s Finance Director, the Chairman of the Audit 
Committee as well as the Group’s General Counsel & Company 
Secretary. It undertakes internal control reviews across the 
Group and reports its findings to the Audit Committee.

Key activities 
The Committee recommended the appointment of three 
new independent Non-Executive Directors to the Board. The 
Committee carried out an extensive search using Egon Zehnder 
which has no connection with the Company. Although only one 
formal meeting was required this year, informal discussions were 
held at other times during the year and the Committee has 
decided to schedule meetings at least three times each year. 
Focus for 2018
The key activities for the year ahead will be:
• the recruitment of a new Chairman and CFO
• reviewing the composition of the Board and its Committees, 
including diversity, to ensure that the right skills and experience 
to support the Group’s strategy are represented and to 
improve the Company’s ability to comply with the requirements 
of the UK Corporate Governance Code in terms of its 
Committee memberships
• the recruitment of at least one additional Non-Executive Director 
who can take on the role of Chairman of the Audit Committee 
during the year and
• an increased emphasis on succession planning
Diversity
The Committee recognises that diversity is important for Board 
effectiveness. The Company has recently announced the 
appointment of three new female independent Non-Executive 
Directors. Diversity (including but not limited to gender diversity) 
will continue to be a consideration when contemplating the

Euromoney AR2017 Governance-Proof 6.indd   50 12/11/2017   11:48:26 AM Key activities
The Committee met four times and in addition met with the 
representatives from internal and external audit after each 
meeting without executives present. The Chairman of the 
Committee also held separate private meetings during the 
year with the external auditor, representatives from internal 
audit and the Finance Director and his team. The key 
activities included:
• identifying and assessing the matters which required significant 
judgement in 2017, including discussion and review of the 
exceptional items that may impact the performance of the 
business
• advising the Board on whether the Annual Report was fair, 
balanced and understandable
• reviewing the Group’s system of internal control and risk 
management, including management’s launch of a finance 
transformation project to improve quality and efficiency of financial 
reporting and tightening financial controls and processes
• reviewing and discussing internal audit reports and 
investigations, and monitoring the resolution of issues raised and
• appointing a new in-house Head of Internal Audit
There was no interaction with the Financial Reporting Council 
(FRC) corporate reporting team during the year.
Looking ahead, the additional topics in 2018 will be to support 
the transition of the new CFO, evaluate the Group’s roll-out 
of new financial systems and associated processes, and to 
increase the Committee’s direct interaction with finance staff 
across the Group to widen and deepen its knowledge of 
people, processes and systems. The Committee will continue 
to work closely with the Head of Internal Audit to monitor 
the resources and effectiveness of the in-house internal 
audit department.
Financial reporting and significant financial judgements
The Committee, with input from the external auditor, assessed whether suitable accounting policies had been adopted, whether 
management had made appropriate estimates and judgements and whether disclosures were balanced and fair. For the year 
ended 30 September 2017 the Committee reviewed the following main issues:
Issue Review
Fair, balanced and understandable
At the request of the Board, the Committee 
has considered whether, in its opinion the 2017 
Annual Report and Accounts is fair, balanced 
and understandable.
Following the Committee’s review of the accounts and after applying its 
knowledge of matters raised during the year, the Committee is satisfied 
that, taken as a whole, the 2017 Annual Report and Accounts is fair, 
balanced and understandable.
Presentation of adjusted and underlying 
performance
Presentation of the adjusted and underlying 
performance and adjusting items, including 
identification and treatment of exceptional items. 
Management considered the latest ESMA 
guidelines on alternative performance measures to 
ensure that the Annual Report and Accounts had 
been updated in line with best practice.
The Committee reviewed the 2017 Annual Report and Accounts 
and discussed with management and the external auditor the 
appropriateness of the adjusted items including consideration of their 
consistency and the avoidance of any misleading effect on the financial 
statements. The Committee challenged management to ensure that each 
item is appropriate to classify as an exceptional item. The Committee 
concluded that the presentation of the adjusted and underlying 
performance including discontinued operations is appropriate.
Goodwill and other intangibles
The Group has goodwill of £400m and other 
intangible assets of £194m. As a result of the 
impairment review at the half-year, the Group 
recognised an impairment charge for NDR 
of £27.4m.
A sensitivity analysis for NDR has been included as 
further disclosures are required under IAS 36 if any 
reasonably possible change to a key assumption 
would cause the cash generating units carrying 
amount to exceed its recoverable amount.
The Committee has considered the assessments made in relation to the 
impairment of goodwill. The Committee discussed the methodology 
and assumptions used in the model supporting the carrying value. The 
Committee reviewed those businesses where headroom has decreased 
or where management has identified impairments. The Committee has 
also understood the sensitivity analysis used by management in its 
review and disclosure of impairment.
Investments
The Group holds material balances relating to 
investments in associates and available for sale 
amounting to £30.4m. As a result of the impairment 
review at year-end, the Group recognised an 
impairment charge of £2.3m.
The Committee reviewed the assessments made in relation to the 
Dealogic, Zanbato and Estimize for potential impairments at the half 
year and year end. The Committee is satisfied with the carrying value 
recognised for Dealogic and that no impairment is required. The 
Committee recognised that Zanbato and Estimize businesses are still in 
start-up phase but based on progress to date the Committee agreed 
with management that an impairment at year-end of the investment in 
Estimize was appropriate. The Committee also reviewed the Board 
presentation of Zanbato and the Group’s further investment in 
convertible securities and concluded that no impairment was required 
at year-end.

Issue Review
Accounting for acquisitions and disposals
The Group made a number of acquisitions and 
disposals during the year. There were a number 
of consequential accounting considerations, 
including identification and fair values of 
intangible assets, fair value of other assets, 
goodwill arising, and gain on sale of disposal 
recognised. The Group also has acquisition 
commitments on previous acquisitions.
The Committee has reviewed the results of the work undertaken in this 
area, the disclosure in the financial statements and has sought further 
explanation where necessary. The Committee reviewed the inputs and 
assumptions into the calculation of the acquisition commitments liability 
at year-end. 
Discontinued operations and assets held-for sale
The Group announced in September 2017 its 
intention to explore strategic options for its Global 
Markets Intelligence Division (CEIC and EMIS). 
Management has classified the assets of £45.3m 
and liabilities of £23.0m as held-for-sale at 
30 September 2017 in accordance with IFRS 5. 
Since the businesses constitute a single division 
and two independent cash generating units 
and contribute 11% to the Group’s adjusted 
operating profit they have also been classified as 
discontinued operations in the Income Statement 
at 30 September 2017 with restated comparatives. 
The Committee has reviewed management’s assumptions in 
accordance with the requirements of IFRS 5 and agree with the 
classification as assets held-for-sale and discontinued operations in the 
Income Statement at 30 September 2017. The Committee has reviewed 
the disclosure and restated comparatives, including the presentation of 
adjusted performance to include discontinued operations.
Taxation
Taxation represents a significant cost to the Group 
in both cash and accounting terms, and the Group 
is exposed to differing tax regimes and risks which 
affect both the carrying values of tax balances 
(including deferred tax) and the resultant Income 
Statement charges. The Committee requested 
third party advice to support its assessment of 
challenges by HMRC and the Canadian Revenue 
Authority. The Group is also exposed to similar risks 
for indirect tax.
The Committee reviewed the tax charge at the half year and full year, 
including the underlying tax effect, deferred tax balances and the 
provision for uncertain tax positions for direct and indirect tax. The 
Committee also reviewed management’s disclosure of tax-related 
matters in the Annual Report and Accounts, including uncertain tax 
matters in note 2 to the financial statements. The Chairman also attends 
Tax and Treasury Committee meetings which provides valuable insight 
into the tax matters, related provisions and helps establish the 
appropriateness of the recognition of the deferred tax balances. 
The Committee is satisfied that all issues have been addressed appropriately and in accordance with the relevant accounting 
standards and principles.
Effectiveness of internal control systems
The Committee has responsibility for reviewing the process 
for identifying and managing risk and for reviewing internal 
controls. It reviews reports on internal controls including reports 
by the Risk Committee, Finance Director and the results from 
internal audits and any investigations performed. In addition the 
Committee reviews the external auditor’s assessment of the 
Group’s minimum financial controls framework.
Internal audit
Following DMGT ceasing to be a majority shareholder, a 
new Head of Internal Audit was appointed to manage the 
Group’s new in-house internal audit function from 1 April 2017. 
The function is responsible for providing independent 
assurance to management and the Committee on the design 
and effectiveness of internal controls to mitigate financial, 
operational and compliance risks. The purpose, authority and 
responsibility of Internal Audit are defined in the Internal Audit 
Charter which is reviewed on an annual basis by the Committee. 
The Head of Internal Audit reports directly to the Chair of 
the Audit Committee.
The internal audit plan follows a risk-based approach and 
is approved annually by the Committee. The plan takes into 
consideration the principal risks of the Group, previous 
internal audit findings, results of management self-assessments 
and significant strategic Group projects such as the finance 
transformation project. Internal audit also collaborate with the 
external auditors to ensure an appropriate breadth of audit 
coverage is obtained.
The Head of Internal Audit is responsible for updating the 
Committee on progress against the plan and any changes to 
the plan are approved by the Committee. At every meeting, 
a summary of work performed, key findings, and progress of 
management action plans are presented to the Committee 
which assists the annual internal audit effectiveness review 
performed by the Committee.
In order to deliver the plan and any additional work, such 
as fraud investigations, internal audit makes use of external 
resources to supplement in-house expertise. The Committee 
review internal audit resource requirements at every meeting 
and the use of external support is considered a practical way 
to scale up the resources of the function when required.

Euromoney AR2017 Governance-Proof 6.indd   52 12/11/2017   11:48:26 AM External auditor
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP (PwC) were appointed by 
shareholders as the Group’s statutory auditor in 2015 following 
a formal tender process. The lead audit partner, Giles Hannam, 
has held the position for three years. The external audit contract 
will be put out to tender at least every ten years. The Company 
has complied with the Statutory Audit Services for Large 
Companies Market Investigation (Mandatory Use of Competitive 
Processes and Audit Committee Responsibilities) Order 2014 for 
the financial year under review.
As part of its role in ensuring effectiveness, the Committee 
reviewed PwC’s audit plan to ensure its appropriateness for 
the Group and has completed a review which focussed on the 
effectiveness, independence and objectivity of the external 
audit. The assessment of effectiveness is based on a framework 
setting out the key areas of the audit process for the Committee 
to consider, as well as the role that management has 
contributed to an effective process. Results from tailored 
questionnaires sent to the Finance Director, Deputy Finance 
Director, and Divisional Finance Directors and PwC’s client 
satisfaction survey were discussed by the Committee and no 
significant issues were raised by the assessment. PwC confirmed 
to the Committee that they maintained appropriate internal 
safeguards to ensure their independence and objectivity. 
The Committee recommends the reappointment of PwC at 
the 2018 AGM.
Non-audit work
The Committee completes an annual assessment of the type of 
non-audit work permissible and a maximum level of non-audit 
fees acceptable. Any non-audit work performed outside this 
remit is assessed and where appropriate approved by the 
Committee. Fees paid to PwC for audit services, audit-related 
services and other non-audit services are set out in note 5. 
During 2017, PwC did not provide significant non-audit services.
The Group’s non-audit fee policy was updated in 2016 to ensure 
compliance with the FRC’s Ethical Standard for Auditors.
Risk committee
The Risk Committee oversees the Group’s risk management 
processes and considers the Group risk register biannually. 
It reviews specific risks and monitors developments in relevant 
legislation and regulation, assessing the impact on the Group. 
The Committee reports on its operations to the Board to enable 
the Directors to determine the overall effectiveness of the 
Group’s risk management.

regular dialogue with shareholders. Meetings with shareholders 
are held, with the CEO, Finance Director and Chairman, to 
discuss annual and interim results and highlight significant 
acquisitions or disposals, or at the request of institutional

Stock Exchange and is a member of the FTSE 250 share index. 
The Directors’ Report comprises pages 44 to 57 of this report 
(together with the sections of the Annual Report incorporated 
by reference). Some of the matters required by legislation 
have been included in the Strategic Report (pages 04 to 39) 
as the Board considers them to be of strategic importance, 
particularly future business developments and principal risks.

continue to operate as the holding Company of the Group.
Forward-looking statements
Certain statements made in this document are forward-looking. 
Such statements are based on current expectations and are 
subject to a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause 
actual events or results to differ materially from any expected 
future events or results referred to in these forward-looking 
statements. Unless otherwise required by applicable law, 
regulation or accounting standards, the Directors do not 
undertake any obligation to update or revise any forward-
looking statements, whether as a result of new information, 
future developments or otherwise. Nothing in this document 
shall be regarded as a profit forecast. 
Group results and dividends 
The Group profit for the year attributable to equity holders 
of the parent amounted to £42.7m (2016: £30.7m). The Board 
approved a new, progressive dividend policy with an increase 
in the dividend pay-out ratio from approximately 33% to 
approximately 40% of adjusted diluted earnings per share. 
The Board is able to recommend an increased final dividend 
of 21.80p per ordinary share (2016: 16.40p), payable on 
Thursday 15 February 2018 to shareholders on the register on 
Friday 1 December 2017. This, together with the interim dividend 
of 8.80p per ordinary share (2016: 7.00p) which was declared 
on 18 May 2017 and paid on, brings the total dividend for the 
year to 30.60p per ordinary share (2016: 23.40p).
Share capital 
The Company’s share capital is divided into ordinary shares 
of 0.25p each. At 30 September 2017 there were 109,101,608 
ordinary shares in issue and fully paid. During the year, 35,425 
ordinary shares of 0.25p each (2016: 64,462 ordinary shares) 
with an aggregate nominal value of £88 (2016: £161) were 
issued following the exercise of share options granted under the 
Company’s share option schemes for a cash consideration of 
£0.3m (2016: £0.3m). On 6 January 2017, the Group completed 
the purchase for cancellation, of 19,247,173 ordinary shares from 
its then majority shareholder, DMG Charles Limited, a DMGT 
group company. The aggregate nominal value of shares 
cancelled was £48,118. Details of the Company’s share capital 
are given in note 23 to the Group’s financial statements. 
Employee Share Trust
The Executive Directors of the Company together with other 
employees of the Group are potential beneficiaries of the 
Euromoney Employee Share Trust and as such, are deemed 
to be interested in any ordinary shares held by the trust. 
At 30 September 2017, the trust’s shareholding totalled 
1,700,777 shares representing 1.6% of the Company’s called-up 
ordinary share capital. There have been no awards transferred 
between 30 September 2017 and the date of this Annual Report 
and Accounts.
Voting rights and restrictions on transfer of shares
Each share entitles its holder to one vote at shareholders’ 
meetings and the right to receive one share of the Company’s 
dividends. There are no special control rights attached to them. 
The Company is not aware of any agreements or control rights 
between existing shareholders that may result in restrictions on 
the transfer of securities (shares or loan notes) or on voting rights. 
Change of control
There are a number of agreements that take effect, alter or 
terminate upon a change of control of the Company following 
a takeover bid. These include the Group’s debt facility 
agreement with HSBC under which the bank can demand 
immediate repayment of outstanding debt upon a change of 
control. Other than this agreement, none of these agreements 
is deemed to be significant in terms of their potential impact 
on the business of the Group as a whole. The Company’s share 
plans contain provisions that take effect in such an event but 
do not entitle participants to a greater interest in the shares 
of the Company than created by the initial grant or award 
under the relevant plan. Details of the Directors’ entitlement to 
compensation for loss of office following a takeover or contract 
termination are given in the Directors’ Remuneration Report. 
Authority to purchase and allot own shares 
At the 2017 AGM, the Company was authorised by shareholders 
to purchase up to 10% of its own shares and to allot shares 
up to an aggregate nominal amount of £81,800. The resolutions 
to renew this authority for a further period will be put to 
shareholders at the 2018 AGM. 
Share buyback
In December 2016, Daily Mail General Trust plc (DMGT) 
announced its intention to reduce its equity interest in 
Euromoney from 68% to 49% through a combination of a 
15% share buyback by the Company and a 10% placing with 
institutional shareholders, which was completed in early 
January. The £193.4m share buyback was funded by a mix of 
cash and new borrowing facilities arranged by the Company, 
and its borrowing facility with DMGT was terminated.

resolution, the Board may also remove a Director where 75% of 
the Board gives written notice to such Director. The Articles of 
Association themselves may be amended by a special resolution 
of the shareholders. 
Following best practice under the 2016 UK Corporate 
Governance Code (the ‘Code’) and in accordance with the 
Company’s Articles of Association, all Directors submit 
themselves for re-election annually. Accordingly, all Directors 
will retire at the forthcoming AGM and, being eligible, will offer 
themselves for re-election. In addition, in accordance with the 
Code, before the re-election of a Non-Executive Director, the 
Chairman is required to confirm to shareholders that, following 
formal performance evaluation, the Non-Executive Directors’ 
performance continues to be effective and demonstrates 
commitment to the role. Accordingly, the Non-Executive 
Directors will retire at the forthcoming AGM and, being 
eligible offer themselves for re-election. 
Directors’ indemnities
A qualifying third-party indemnity (QTPI) as permitted by the 
Company’s Articles of Association and Section 232 and 234 of 
the Companies Act 2006, has been granted by the Company 
to each of the Directors of the Company. Under the provisions 
of QTPI the Company undertakes to indemnify each Director 
against liability to third parties (excluding criminal and 
regulatory penalties) and to pay Directors’ costs as incurred, 
provided that they are reimbursed to the Company if the 
Director is found guilty or, in an action brought by the Company, 
judgement is given against the Director.
Directors’ responsibilities
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report 
and the financial statements in accordance with applicable law 
and regulation.
Company law requires the Directors to prepare financial 
statements for each financial year. Under that law the Directors 
have prepared the Group financial statements in accordance 
with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as 
adopted by the European Union and Company financial 
statements in accordance with United Kingdom Generally 
Accepted Accounting Practice (United Kingdom Accounting 
Standards, comprising FRS 102 “The Financial Reporting 
Standard applicable in the UK and Republic of Ireland”, and 
applicable law). Under Company law the Directors must not 
approve the financial statements unless they are satisfied that 
they give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Group 
and Company and of the profit or loss of the Group and 
Company for that period. In preparing the financial statements, 
the Directors are required to:
• select suitable accounting policies and then apply them 
consistently
• state whether applicable IFRSs as adopted by the European 
Union have been followed for the Group financial statements 
and United Kingdom Accounting Standards, comprising FRS 102, 
have been followed for the Company financial statements, 
subject to any material departures disclosed and explained in 
the financial statements
• make judgements and accounting estimates that are reasonable 
and prudent; and
• prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis 
unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Group and 
Company will continue in business
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting 
records that are sufficient to show and explain the Group and 
Company’s transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy 
at any time the financial position of the Group and Company 
and enable them to ensure that the financial statements and the 
Directors’ Remuneration Report comply with the Companies Act 
2006 and, as regards the Group financial statements, Article 4 
of the IAS Regulation.
The Directors are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of 
the Group and Company and hence for taking reasonable steps 
for the prevention and detection of fraud and other 
irregularities.
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity 
of the Company’s website. Legislation in the United Kingdom 
governing the preparation and dissemination of financial 
statements may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.
The Directors consider that the Annual Report and Accounts, 
taken as a whole, is fair, balanced and understandable and 
provides the information necessary for shareholders to assess 
the Group’s and the Company’s performance, business model 
and strategy.

in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted 
Accounting Practice (United Kingdom Accounting Standards, 
comprising FRS 102 “The Financial Reporting Standard 
applicable in the UK and Republic of Ireland”, and applicable 
law), give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial 
position and profit of the Company
• the Group financial statements, which have been prepared in 
accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union, give 
a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and 
profit of the Group; and
• the Strategic Report and the Directors’ Report includes a fair 
review of the development and performance of the business and 
the position of the Group and Company, together with a 
description of the principal risks and uncertainties that it faces

Report from the Chairman of 
the Remuneration Committee 
Dear Shareholder, I am pleased to present the Directors’ 
Remuneration Report for 2017 which has been prepared by 
the Remuneration Committee (“Committee”) on behalf of the 
Board. The Committee continues to place great importance on 
ensuring there is a clear link between remuneration and delivery 
of the Group’s strategy. For 2017, the priority has been to 
progress with the transformation of the Group, in line with the 
three pillar strategy and re-shaping the operating model into 
four segments and seven clear divisions with strategic 
alignment. As trialled last year this has necessitated a strategic 
talent review and the Committee’s main activity during the year 
included an overhaul of reward at the Group Management 
Board. The key remuneration outcomes for the year and plans 
for the coming year are below. Further details are provided in 
the second section of the report commencing on page 66.
2017 reward outcomes
The Group continues its transformation following the launch of 
its new strategy, and has delivered an improved performance 
over the prior year and is now on firmer foundations for future 
growth. Total revenues were £428.4m, an increase of 6% 
year-on-year although 1% down on an underlying basis. 
Adjusted profit before tax increased by 4% to £106.5m, 
marginally ahead of expectations. As a result of the increase in 
adjusted profit before tax, significant progress on the portfolio 
and action on managing the senior talent, the annual bonus 
for Andrew Rashbass will pay out at 107% of salary against a 
maximum of 150%. Any annual bonus earned in excess of 100% 
of salary will be paid via a nil-cost option, the vesting of which 
will be deferred for two years. Colin Jones, the Group’s Finance 
Director, is on a profit share scheme linked to adjusted diluted 
earnings per share (before tax) and his profit share increased 
by 25% to £0.7m, in line with the increase in adjusted earnings 
per share. 
Finance Director
During the year Colin Jones announced his intention to retire by 
the summer of 2018. Colin has served for 21 years on the Board 
and has been instrumental in the growth of Euromoney during 
that time, for which the Board is grateful. When appointing a 
replacement for Colin during 2018, the Committee will adhere 
to the remuneration policy on recruitment.
Committee Chair
Imogen Joss joined the Board recently as a Non-Executive 
Director who has a wealth of experience in this area and 
is expected, subject to the decision of the Nominations 
Committee, to become Chairman of the Remuneration 
Committee in due course.
Remuneration Policy Shareholder 
approval at the 2018 AGM
In line with the Large and Medium-sized Companies and 
Groups (Accounts and Reports) Regulations 2013, the Director’s 
Remuneration Policy, which will be effective from 1 October 
2018, is being put forward for a binding shareholder vote. 
The existing policy will remain in force until that date and 
this can be found on the Company’s website. The Annual 
Remuneration Implementation Report together with this letter 
is subject to an advisory shareholder vote. Both the binding 
vote and advisory vote will be put to the 2018 AGM to be held 
on 1 February 2018. The sections of this report that have been 
subject to audit are marked in the contents above. 
The members of the Committee include a representative of  
its major shareholder, DMGT. The Committee consults with its 
shareholders prior to any major changes in its remuneration 
arrangements.

Euromoney AR2017 Governance-Proof 6.indd   58 12/11/2017   11:48:28 AM Remuneration Policy
The Board believes in aligning the interests of management 
with those of shareholders. It is the Group’s policy to construct 
executive remuneration packages such that a significant part 
of a Director’s remuneration is linked to performance measures 
aligned with the Group’s key strategic, financial and operational 
objectives and with the creation of sustainable long-term 
shareholder value. Salaries and benefits are generally not 
intended to be the most significant part of a Director’s 
remuneration. The policy is being put forward for a binding 
shareholder vote at the 2018 AGM to be effective from 1 October 
2018. The existing policy remains in force until that date.
Information not subject to audit
Introduction 
The current remuneration policy was approved by shareholders 
at the General Meeting held on 1 June 2015 and can be found 
on our website (www.euromoneyplc.com/investors). The policy 
took effect from 1 October 2015. The policy has been updated 
to reflect subsequent guidance and to take account of the 
organisational changes at the Company and will take effect 
from 1 October 2018.
The key changes in the new remuneration policy are:
• The removal of profit share incentives for Executive Directors, 
which have been replaced by the annual bonus and 
Performance Share Plan (PSP) arrangements approved on 
1 June 2015
• The Capital Appreciation Plan (CAP) 2014 has been removed as 
it will not vest and no further awards under the CAP scheme will 
be made
• The level of deferral under the Annual Bonus award has been 
specified as has the maximum level of bonus payment at 
threshold achievement
• The normal grant under a PSP will be a three-year performance 
period with a further two years holding period
• Increasing the shareholding requirement to 200% of basic salary 
for all Executive Directors and the introduction of a shareholding 
requirement of 100% of annual fees for Non-Executive Directors;
• Adjustments to reflect the transformed Board and 
organisational structure
• The Daily Mail General Trust (DMGT) Share Incentive Plan (SIP) 
is no longer available to employees of the Company
• Committee discretion to make non-standard remuneration 
decisions where an Executive Director is appointed on an 
interim basis
• Clarification on the treatment of tax on Non-Executive 
Directors’ expenses
• Commitment to introduce wider consultation with both 
employees and shareholders
The new remuneration policy provides flexibility for designing 
future incentive plans for Executive Directors and senior 
management and ensuring these incentives are closely 
aligned with the Group’s long-term strategy.
The implementation of the current remuneration policy for the 
Executive Directors in 2017 is set out on pages 66 to 69. 
These new arrangements are expected to take effect from 
1 October 2018.
Compliance statement
This report sets out the Group’s policy and structure for the 
remuneration of Executive and Non-Executive Directors. 
This policy report is intended to be in full compliance with 
the requirements of the Large and Medium-sized Companies 
and Groups (Accounts and Reports) Regulations 2013. 
In formulating its Directors’ Remuneration Policy, the Committee 
has considered employee pay and benefits and has also sought 
advice on best practice from Deloitte. The Committee consulted 
with its top shareholders by equity holding. No specific 
consultation with employees was undertaken for this policy 
however the Company is committed to introducing an employee 
forum for consulting on remuneration matters, including 
executive remuneration.

BASIC SALARY
Purpose and link 
to strategy
• Part of an overall market competitive pay package with salary 
generally not the most significant part of a Director’s overall package
• Reflect the individual’s experience, role and performance within 
the Company
• No absolute maximum has 
been set for Executive Director 
salaries. The Committee is 
guided by the general increase 
for the broader employee 
population although larger 
increases may be considered 
appropriate in circumstances 
(including, but not limited to, a 
change in an individual’s 
responsibilities or in the scale of 
their role or in the size and 
complexity of the Group). 
Larger increases may also be 
considered appropriate if a 
Director has been initially 
appointed to the Board at a 
lower than typical salary
Operation • Paid monthly in cash
• Normally reviewed by the Remuneration Committee in April each year
Benchmarking • The Remuneration Committee examines salary levels at FTSE 250 
companies and other listed peer group companies to help determine 
Executive Director pay increases
• The Remuneration Committee takes into account the general level of 
salary increases awarded to employees
Relationship to 
employee salaries
• The approach to setting base salary increases across the Group takes 
into account performance of the individuals concerned, the performance 
of the business they work for, micro and macroeconomic factors, and 
market rates for similar roles, skills and responsibility
BENEFITS
Purpose and link 
to strategy
• Basic benefits are provided as part of a market competitive  
pay package
• There is no overall maximum as 
the level of benefits depends 
on the annual cost of providing 
individual items in the relevant 
local market and the 
individual’s specific role
Operation Benefits may include:
• Private healthcare
• Life insurance
• Overseas relocation and housing costs
The Committee has discretion to add or remove benefits from this list
Relationship 
to employee 
benefits
• Benefits are available to all Directors and employees subject to a 
minimum length of service or passing a probationary period
Benefit levels • All Executive Directors participate in the healthcare scheme offered 
in the country where they reside
PENSIONS
Purpose and link 
to strategy
• Retirement benefits are provided as part of a market competitive 
pay package
• The maximum employer’s 
contribution to a pension 
scheme is 15% of pensionable 
salary
Operation • Directors may participate in the pension arrangements applicable to 
the country where they work
• A Director who elects to cease contributing to a Company pension 
scheme due to changes in tax or pension legislation may choose to 
receive a pension allowance in lieu of the Company’s pension 
contributions
Relationship 
to employee 
pension levels
• All Directors and employees are entitled to participate in the same 
pension scheme arrangements applicable to the country where 
they work

ANNUAL BONUS PLAN
Purpose and link 
to strategy
• The Annual Bonus Plan links reward to key business targets and an 
individual’s contribution
• The Annual Bonus Plan provides alignment with shareholders’ interests 
through the operation of bonus deferral
• The maximum award that can 
be made under the Annual 
Bonus Plan is 150% of salary. 
Each year the Remuneration 
Committee will determine 
the maximum annual bonus 
opportunity for individual 
Executive Directors within 
this limit
• The maximum level of bonus 
payment at threshold 
achievement is 0%
Operation • Any Executive Director may participate in the Annual Bonus Plan
• Annual bonus payments will be paid in cash following the release of 
audited results and/or as a deferred award over Company shares
• Any bonus earned in excess of 100% of salary will be awarded as a 
deferred award
• Deferred awards are usually granted in the form of conditional share 
awards or nil-cost options (and may also be settled in cash)
• Deferred awards usually vest two years after award although may vest 
early on leaving employment or on a change of control (see later 
sections)
• An additional payment (in the form of cash or shares) may be made in 
respect of shares which vest under deferred awards to reflect the value 
of dividends which would have been paid on those shares (this payment 
may assume that dividends had been reinvested in Company shares on 
a cumulative basis)
• The annual bonus payable is based on performance assessed over one 
year and may be based upon any of appropriate financial, strategic and 
individual performance measures. No more than half of the Annual 
Bonus will generally be determined by strategic and/or individual 
performance measures
• Any annual bonus payout is ultimately at the discretion of the 
Remuneration Committee
• The cash bonus will be subject to recovery, and / or deferred awards will 
be withheld, at the Remuneration Committee’s discretion in exceptional 
circumstances where, before the preliminary announcement of audited 
results during the third financial year following the financial year in which 
the bonus is determined, a material misstatement or miscalculation 
comes to light which resulted in an overpayment under the Annual Bonus 
Plan, or there is gross misconduct
Relationship to 
all employee 
incentive schemes
• Incentive schemes, like the Annual Bonus Plan, are an important part of 
the Group culture. The Directors believe they directly reward good and 
exceptional performance. Most employees across the Group have an 
incentive scheme in place

LONG-TERM INCENTIVE PLANS
Purpose and link 
to strategy
• Share schemes are an important part of overall compensation and 
align the interests of Directors and managers with shareholders. They 
encourage Directors to deliver long-term, sustainable profit and share 
price growth
•  The maximum annual 
award permitted under the 
PSP is shares with a market 
value of 200% of annualised 
basic salary
Operation 2015 Performance Share Plan (PSP)
• Any Executive Director may participate in the PSP
• These awards will normally be subject to a performance period of 
three years, with an additional holding period of two years. If the 
Remuneration Committee determines so, an alternative performance 
period may be applied (with a minimum of at least three years). The 
aggregate of the performance period and additional holding period 
shall not be less than five years. Awards may vest early on leaving 
employment or on a change of control (see later sections). Vesting of 
these awards will be based on financial performance measures and/or 
strategic business goals, with the precise measures and weighting of the 
measures determined by the Remuneration Committee on the grant of 
each award. For achieving a threshold level of performance against a 
performance measure, no more than 25% of the portion of the PSP 
award determined by that measure will vest. Vesting of that portion 
would then increase to 100% for achieving a stretching maximum 
performance target
• All PSP awards may be granted as conditional awards of shares or 
nil-cost options (or, if appropriate, as cash-settled equivalents). An 
additional payment (in the form of cash or shares) may be made in 
respect of shares which vest under PSP awards to reflect the value of 
dividends which would have been paid on those shares (and this 
payment may assume that dividends had been reinvested in Company 
shares on a cumulative basis)
• PSP awards will be subject to recovery and / or withholding at the 
Remuneration Committee’s discretion in exceptional circumstances 
where, before the preliminary announcement of audited results during 
the sixth financial year following the financial year in which the award is 
granted, a material misstatement or miscalculation comes to light which 
resulted in an over-vesting of PSP awards, or gross misconduct
Relationship to 
all employee 
long-term 
incentive schemes
• The PSP rewards the creation of long-term shareholder value and is 
potentially available to all senior employees across the Group
LONG-TERM INCENTIVE PLANS (ALL-EMPLOYEE SCHEMES)
Purpose and link 
to strategy
• All-employee share schemes align staff with the Group’s financial 
performance and promote a sense of ownership
• Participants save a fixed 
monthly amount of up to £500 
(or such other limit as may be 
approved from time to time by 
HMRC) for three years
Operation Euromoney SAYE scheme
• The Group operates an all-employee save as you earn scheme in which 
those Directors employed in the UK are eligible to participate. No 
performance conditions attach to options granted under this plan. It is 
designed to incentivise all employees. Participants are able to buy shares 
in the Company at a price set at a discount of up to 20% to the market 
value at the start of the savings period
Annual Report and Accounts 2017
62
Euromoney AR2017 Governance-Proof 6.indd   62 12/11/2017   11:48:28 AM Notes to table:
• The Remuneration Committee may vary any performance condition(s) 
if an event occurs which causes it to determine that a varied condition 
would be more appropriate, provided that any such varied condition is 
not materially less difficult to satisfy. In the event that the Remuneration 
Committee was to make an adjustment of this sort, a full explanation 
would be provided in the next Remuneration Report.
• Performance measures – The performance measures used in the variable 
incentive plans are reviewed annually and chosen to focus executive 
rewards on delivery of key financial targets for the relevant performance 
period in addition, where appropriate, to key strategic or operational 
goals relevant to an individual. Precise targets are set at the start of each 
performance period by the Remuneration Committee based on relevant 
reference points, including, for Group financial targets, the Company’s 
business plan, and are designed to be appropriately stretching.
• The Remuneration Committee intends to honour any commitments 
entered into with current or former Directors on their original terms, 
including outstanding incentive awards, which have been disclosed 
in previous remuneration reports and, where relevant, are consistent 
with a previous policy approved by shareholders. Any such payments 
to former Directors will be set out in the Remuneration Report as and 
when they occur.
• The Remuneration Committee reserves the right to make any 
remuneration payments and payments for loss of office (including 
exercising any discretions available to it in connection with such 
payments) notwithstanding that they are not in line with the policy set out 
above where the terms of the payment were agreed; (i) before the date 
the Company’s first remuneration policy approved by shareholders in 
accordance with section 439A of the Companies Act came into effect; 
and (ii) before the policy set out above came into effect, provided that 
the terms of the payment were consistent with the shareholder-approved 
remuneration policy in force at the time they were agreed; or (iii) at a 
time when the relevant individual was not a Director of the Company 
and, in the opinion of the Remuneration Committee, the payment was 
not in consideration for the individual becoming a Director of the 
Company. For these purposes “payments” includes the Remuneration 
Committee satisfying awards of variable remuneration and, in relation to 
an award over shares, the terms of the payment are “agreed” at the time 
the award is granted.
• The Remuneration Committee may make minor amendments to the 
Policy (for regulatory, exchange control, tax or administrative purposes 
or to take account of a change in legislation) without obtaining 
shareholder approval for that amendment. 
• The Remuneration Committee will operate the variable incentive plans 
according to their respective rules which provide flexibility in a number 
of regards. 
• Under the PSP and the deferred share bonus plan, outstanding awards 
will vest early in the event of a change of control / takeover unless the 
change of control is an internal reorganisation or the Remuneration 
Committee determines otherwise in which case awards will be 
exchanged for equivalent awards over shares in the acquiring company. 
In the case of PSP awards, the extent to which awards vest will take into 
account the satisfaction of the performance conditions and, unless the 
Remuneration Committee determines otherwise, on a time pro-rated 
basis by reference to the proportion of the performance period that has 
elapsed. If the Company is wound up or is or may be affected by a 
demerger, delisting, special dividend or other event which would, in the 
Remuneration Committee’s opinion affect the Company’s share price, 
the Remuneration Committee may allow PSP and deferred share bonus 
plan awards to vest on the same basis as for a takeover.
• Any buy-out award granted as part of the recruitment of an Executive 
Director will be treated on a change of control in line with the agreed 
commercial terms of that award.
• If there is a variation of the Company’s share capital or a demerger, 
delisting, special dividend, rights issue or other event which, in the 
Remuneration Committee’s opinion would affect the Company’s share 
price, the Remuneration Committee may adjust the terms of the awards.
Non-Executive Directors
The Remuneration of Non-Executive Directors is determined 
by the Board based on the time commitment required by the 
Non-Executive Directors, their role and market conditions. 
Each Non-Executive Director receives a base fee for services 
to the Board with an additional fee payable for Non-Executive 
Directors with selected, additional responsibilities (for example, 
the chairs of the Remuneration and Audit Committees and the 
Senior Independent Director). The Non-Executive Directors 
do not participate in any of the Company’s incentive schemes. 
The Non-Executive Directors receive reimbursement for 
reasonable expenses (including, where relevant, tax payable 
on those expenses) incurred as part of their role as Non-
Executive Directors.
Policy on external appointments
The Company allows its Executive Directors to take a limited 
number of outside directorships provided they are not 
expected to impinge on their principal employment. 
Subject to the approval of the Company Chairman, Executive 
Directors may retain the remuneration received from the first 
such appointment.
Recruitment policy
Compensation packages for new Board Directors are set in 
accordance with the prevailing Remuneration Policy at their 
time of joining the Board. The main components are detailed 
below.
New Executive Directors will receive a salary commensurate 
with their responsibilities and which will not be the most 
significant part of their overall remuneration package. The 
Director will also be offered the benefit of private healthcare 
and life assurance. Other benefits may include a pension 
allowance, relocation or housing allowance.
New Executive Directors will participate in one or more of the 
incentive plans outlined in the section “Detailed remuneration 
arrangements of Executive Directors” earlier in this Policy 
Report. The initial annual bonus and/or long-term incentive 
plan award to a new recruit may be granted with different 
measures and or targets to other Directors in the year of joining 
if deemed appropriate.
Where appropriate, a new Executive Director may be granted 
a one-off buy-out award for loss of earnings from previous 
employment which have been forfeited in order to join the 
Company. When structuring a buy-out award the Remuneration 
Committee will take account of all relevant factors, including 
any performance conditions attached to forfeited incentive 
awards, the likelihood of those conditions being met, the 
proportion of the vesting/performance period remaining 
and the form of the award (e.g. cash or shares). The overriding 
principle will be that any replacement buy-out award should, 
in aggregate, not exceed the commercial value of the earnings 
which have been forfeited. The Remuneration Committee may, 
in a recruitment scenario, rely upon the Listing Rules exemption 
from shareholder approval to grant a one-off buy-out award to 
facilitate the recruitment of a Director.
New Executive Directors are entitled to participate in the 
Euromoney SAYE scheme.

Continued
Where an Executive Director is appointed from within the 
organisation, the normal policy of the Company is that any 
legacy arrangements would be honoured in line with the 
original terms and conditions. Similarly, if an Executive Director 
is appointed following the Company’s acquisition of or merger 
with another company or business, legacy terms and conditions 
would be honoured.
Where an appointment is made to fill an Executive Director 
role on a short-term basis the Remuneration Committee retains 
discretion to make appropriate remuneration decisions outside 
the standard Policy to meet the individual circumstances of 
recruitment on an interim basis.
New Non-Executive Directors appointed to the Board will 
receive a base fee in line with that payable to other Non-
Executive Directors. In the event that a Non-Executive Director is 
required to temporarily take on the role of an Executive Director, 
their remuneration may include any of the elements listed above 
for Executive Directors.
Directors’ service contracts 
The Company’s policy is to employ Executive Directors on 
service agreements which are terminable on 12 months’ notice. 
The Remuneration Committee seeks to minimise termination 
payments and believes these should be restricted to the value 
of remuneration for the notice period.
The Company’s Executive Directors are employed for an 
indefinite term and the service agreements provide for a notice 
period of 12 months from the Company and the executive. 
Each Executive Director participates in bonus or incentive 
arrangements (and in the case of Andrew Rashbass a 
recruitment award as compensation for forfeiting remuneration 
in order to join the Company).
The service agreement for the Chief Executive Officer, 
Andrew Rashbass, includes the following provisions on 
termination: 12 months’ notice from the Company (and the 
Executive) and during such notice the Executive will normally 
continue to be entitled to receive, at the absolute discretion 
of the Remuneration Committee, bonus, long-term incentive 
awards that accrue during the notice period and the 
recruitment bonus (to the extent that the award vests during 
the notice period). If the Company terminates employment and 
elects to make a payment in lieu of notice (PILON) this will be 
calculated on the basis of Andrew Rashbass’ base salary for 
the notice period and will also take account of any recruitment 
bonus to which he would become entitled during the notice 
period. At the absolute discretion of the Remuneration 
Committee, he will also be considered for any bonuses to 
which he would or may become entitled during the notice 
period. The other Executive Directors’ service agreements 
provide for 12 months’ notice and provisions for payment in 
lieu of notice and garden leave.
The service agreements for the Executive Directors are 
expressed to expire on reaching their respective retirement 
age; however, the Executive Directors could not, under UK law, 
be required to retire at this age following the abolition of the 
default retirement age.
In the event that employment is terminated due to incapacity 
(90 calendar days absence in a rolling 12-month period) the 
service agreements provide for termination on six months’ 
notice. In these circumstances the Company would also make 
a payment for pension up to the date of termination for all 
Executive Directors.
With the exception of Sir Patrick Sergeant, none of the Non-
Executive Directors has a service contract, although John Botts, 
David Pritchard, Tristan Hillgarth and Andrew Ballingal serve 
under a letter of appointment. The service contract of Sir Patrick 
Sergeant provides for 12 months’ expense allowance and an 
expense allowance up to the date of termination in the event 
of incapacity.
The Directors’ service contracts are available for shareholder 
inspection at the Company’s registered office.
Policy on payment for loss of office
The Company’s approach to payments in the event of 
termination is to take account of the individual circumstances 
including the reason for termination, individual performance, 
contractual obligations, the terms of bonus incentives and long-
term incentive plans in which the Executive Director participates. 
The Company’s general practice for all Executive Directors is 
to provide for 12 months’ salary and pension up to the date 
of termination. 
The Company may lawfully terminate an Executive Director’s 
employment without compensation in circumstances where the 
Company is entitled to terminate for cause (this is defined in the 
service agreements).
The Remuneration Committee may determine that any Executive 
Director is eligible to receive an annual bonus in respect of the 
financial year in which they cease employment. This bonus 
would usually be time apportioned. In determining the level 
of bonus to be paid, the Remuneration Committee may, at its 
discretion, take into account performance up to the date of 
cessation or over the financial year as a whole.
The treatment of outstanding share awards in the event of 
termination is governed by the relevant share plan rules as 
summarised below. 
If an Executive Director participates in the PSP and ceases to 
be an officer or employee of the Group during the performance 
period in any circumstances other than those set out below, an 
unvested award will lapse on the date on which their 
employment ceases. 
If a participant dies, an unvested PSP award will vest at the time 
of the participant’s death taking into account the satisfaction 
of the performance condition and, unless the Remuneration 
Committee determines otherwise, on a time pro-rated basis 
by reference to the proportion of the performance period that 
has elapsed. 
If a participant is treated as a good leaver because cessation of 
employment is as a result of ill-health, injury, disability, the sale 
of the individual’s employing business or entity out of the Group 
or any other reason at the Remuneration Committee’s discretion 
(a “Good Leaver Reason”) a participant’s unvested PSP award 
will usually continue until the normal vesting date except where 
the Remuneration Committee determines it should vest as soon 
as reasonably practicable following the participant’s cessation. 
The extent to which the award vests will take account of the 
extent to which the performance condition is satisfied and, 
unless the Remuneration Committee determines otherwise, 
on a time pro-rated basis by reference to the proportion of 
the performance period that has elapsed.
Annual Report and Accounts 2017
64
Euromoney AR2017 Governance-Proof 6.indd   64 12/11/2017   11:48:28 AM If a PSP award is subject to a holding period and a participant 
ceases to be an officer or employee of the Group during that 
holding period, his/her award will normally be released at 
the end of the holding period except where the Remuneration 
Committee determines it should be released following the 
participant’s cessation. However, if a participant is summarily 
dismissed during a holding period, his/her award will lapse 
immediately. Nil-cost options will normally be exercisable for 
six months after release. 
Where an Executive Director participates in the deferred share 
bonus plan and ceases employment, their outstanding awards 
will normally lapse unless cessation is due to the participant’s 
death or a Good Leaver Reason, in which case outstanding 
awards will vest at the normal vesting date or, if the 
Remuneration Committee so determines, as soon as reasonably 
practicable following the individual’s cessation.
Any buy-out award granted as part of the recruitment of an 
Executive Director will be treated on cessation of employment 
in line with the agreed commercial terms of that award.
The Remuneration Committee reserves the right to make any 
other payments in connection with a Director’s cessation of 
office or employment where the payments are made in good 
faith in discharge of an existing legal obligation (or by way of 
damages for breach of such an obligation) or by way of a 
compromise or settlement of any claim arising in connection 
with the cessation of a Director’s office or employment. Any such 
payments may include but are not limited to paying any fees for 
outplacement assistance and/or the Director’s legal and/or 
professional advice fees in connection with his cessation of 
office or employment.
No other termination payments are provided unless otherwise 
required by law.
Policy for Directors holding equity in the Company 
There is a minimum shareholding requirement of 200% of base 
salary for Executive Directors on a continuous basis. A newly 
appointed Executive Director will have a period of five years 
from their date of appointment to meet the minimum 
shareholding requirement.
There is a minimum shareholding requirement of 100% of annual 
fees for Non-Executive Directors on a continuous basis. This 
excludes Non-Executive Directors who are also Executive 
Directors of DMGT as they have a similar requirement at DMGT.

Annual Report and Accounts 2017

Euromoney AR2017 Governance-Proof 6.indd   66 12/11/2017   11:48:29 AM The individual objectives for Andrew Rashbass in 2017 were:
Objective Outcome % bonus payable
Book of business growth year-on-year. Below threshold 0%
Portfolio management targeting reducing drag from  
bottom left quadrant businesses and improving  
upper right quadrant businesses (see page 16).
Between threshold and target 5.7%
Deliverables against the strategic talent review At maximum 12.5%
These objectives were weighted equally and monitored by the Committee. In determining the final level of bonus payable, the 
Committee noted that the book of business growth was below the threshold required for the objective to be met. Progress had 
been made on the identified quadrants within the portfolio, albeit below the target levels required. The Committee agreed 
that Andrew Rashbass had made an outstanding contribution on the organisation operating model resulting in a new Group 
Management Board. On the basis of the above, the annual bonus will pay out at 49% achievement of maximum opportunity 
against the individual objectives and an overall bonus of 107% of salary. Any annual bonus earned in excess of 100% of salary 
will be paid as a nil-cost option, the vesting of which will be deferred for two years.
Pensions
Pension amounts are those contributed by the Company to pension schemes or cash amounts paid in lieu of pension contributions. 
Executive Directors can participate in the Euromoney Pension Plan (a money purchase plan) or their own private pension scheme. 
The Harmsworth Pension Scheme closed to future accrual of benefits on 31 December 2015. Under the Harmsworth Pension 
Scheme, the following pension benefits were earned by the Directors:

Buy-out award for Andrew Rashbass
A one-off award of shares in the Company with a value of £2,250,000 was made in 2016 in order to compensate Andrew Rashbass 
for incentives foregone on leaving his previous employment. This was considered to be no more than the comparable commercial 
value of the incentives foregone by him from his previous employment. Based on the Company’s average share price for the month 
of September 2015, 221,011 shares were awarded on 1 October 2015. Subject to continued employment, 40% of this award vested on 
30 September 2016, a further 20% was due to vest on 30 September 2017, and the remaining 40% will vest in two equal tranches on 
30 September 2018 and 2019 respectively.
Under the terms of this award, 44,202 options (2016: 88,404) were due to vest on 30 September 2017. This date was in a close period 
and the rules of the scheme determine no vesting should occur until there is an open period. As at the date of this Annual Report 
and Accounts, there had been no open period and therefore no exercise has taken place. 
Long-term incentives
No share plan awards under the PSP or CAP 2014 were due to vest in the year for the Executive Directors. As the performance 
criteria of the CAP and Company Share Option Plan (CSOP) have not been met, Colin Jones’ outstanding awards of 14,457 under 
CAP 2014 and 2,688 under CSOP 2014 have lapsed. There were 167,419 options granted to Executive Directors during the year 
under the PSP. Details of the Group’s share option schemes are set in the Remuneration Policy that can be found on the website 
and note 24 to the Group’s financial statements.

Comparison of overall performance and remuneration of the CEO
The chart below compares the Company’s total shareholder return with the FTSE 250 index over the past nine financial years. For 
these purposes shareholder return represents the theoretical growth in value of a shareholding over a specific period, assuming 
that dividends are reinvested to purchase additional shares. The Company is a constituent of the FTSE 250 index and, accordingly, 
this is considered to be the most appropriate benchmark.

The table below illustrates the change in remuneration for the CEO compared with the change in remuneration of the average 
employee across the Group at constant currency. The Directors feel that this group of people is the most appropriate as a 
comparator because employee pay is determined annually by the Committee at the same time as that of the CEO and under the 
same economic circumstances. The Directors believe this demonstrates the best link between the changes in average remuneration 
compared to the CEO.

Remuneration in the above table excludes long-term incentive payments and pension benefits. There is no change in salary from 
2016 for the CEO remuneration as Andrew Rashbass did not receive an increase in the April salary review.
Relative importance of spend on pay
The table below illustrates the Company’s spend on employee pay in comparison to profits and distributions to shareholders. These

Remuneration Committee
The Committee meets four times a year and additionally as required. It is responsible for determining the contract terms, 
remuneration and other benefits of Executive Directors, including performance-related incentives. The Committee reviews the 
remuneration and incentive plans of the Executive Directors and other key employees as well as looking at the remuneration costs 
and policies of the Group as a whole. The Committee’s terms of reference are available on the Company’s website.
During 2017, the Committee met eight times and informal discussions were held at other times during the year.

All members of the Committee are Non-Executive Directors of the Company. For the year under review, the Committee also 
sought advice and information from the Company’s CEO, Finance Director, the Director of Human Resources and the Group 
Reward Director. The Committee’s terms of reference permit its members to obtain professional advice on any matter. Guidance 
was sought from Deloitte on benchmarking of Non-Executive Director fees, the review of the Remuneration Policy and PSP 
performance measures, and fees of £38,350 were payable for this advice. Deloitte was appointed in 2013 by the Committee, 
is a founding member of the Remuneration Consultants Group and voluntarily operates under the code of conduct in relation 
to executive remuneration consulting in the UK. The Committee is satisfied as to the independent nature of their advice.
The key activities of the Committee in the year included:
• approving the grant to and setting suitable performance measures for the PSP options for Andrew Rashbass and Colin Jones
• setting objectives for the Annual Bonus Plan for Andrew Rashbass
• approving the salary increase, implementation of Annual Bonus and PSP share grants to Divisional Directors to replace profit share 
(some transitional arrangements remain in place)
• recommending to the Board the increase in fees for the Chairman and the Non-Executive Directors. John Botts was not involved in 
any decision regarding his own fee
• approving the annual profit shares and bonuses for Executive Directors and Divisional Directors
• approving the grant of a SAYE offer at a 20% discount to market price and
• reviewing the Directors’ Remuneration Policy and recommending changes for approval by shareholders

Basic salary Directors’ salaries from 1 October 2017 are as set out on page 66 and are unchanged. 
The salary for the incoming CFO will be in line with the remuneration policy regarding recruitment.
Salaries will be reviewed in April 2018.
Pensions and benefits No change to prior year for Andrew Rashbass or Colin Jones. The incoming CFO will be in line with 
the remuneration policy regarding recruitment.
Annual incentive 
Annual Bonus Plan
The weightings for the individual and financial objectives for Andrew Rashbass’ Annual Bonus 
Plan in 2018 will remain the same as 2017 with 75% based on adjusted profit before tax and 25% 
on individual objectives. The Committee considers that disclosing the precise targets, which are 
commercially sensitive, of the Annual Bonus Plan would not be in shareholders’ interests and 
awards made will be published at the end of the performance period where possible.
The incoming CFO will be placed on the Annual Bonus Plan arrangements and will have a 
maximum opportunity that does not exceed the remuneration policy.
Annual bonus deferral Any amount above target for Andrew Rashbass and the incoming CFO will be deferred into nil-
cost options for two years in line with 2017.
Profit share Colin Jones’ profit share scheme is set out on page 66 and will remain the same for 2018 and will 
be paid pro-rata to his leaving date.
Long-term incentive In addition to EPS, a second performance measure of operating margin will be introduced for 2018 
for awards to be made under the PSP to Andrew Rashbass and the incoming CFO. The quantum 
of award will remain unchanged for Andrew Rashbass. 
Directors employed in the UK are eligible to participate in the SAYE.
Non-Executive Directors fees Non-Executive Directors’ fees will not be reviewed.
Shareholding requirement Guidelines recommended by the Committee, and as indicated in the revised remuneration 
policy are: 
• Non-Executive Directors: 100% of annual fee 
• Executive Directors: 200% of salary 
• Group Management Board: 75% of salary.

Independent Auditors’ Report
to the members of Euromoney Institutional Investor PLC
Report on the audit of the ﬁnancial statements
Opinion
In our opinion:
• Euromoney Institutional Investor PLC’s Group financial statements and Company financial statements (the ‘financial statements’) give 
a true and fair view of the state of the Group’s and of the Company’s affairs at 30 September 2017 and of the Group’s profit and cash 
flows for the year then ended;
• the Group financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) 
as adopted by the European Union;
• the Company financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting 
Practice (United Kingdom Accounting Standards, comprising FRS 102 ‘The Financial Reporting Standard applicable in the UK and 
Republic of Ireland’, and applicable law); and
• the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 and, as regards the 
Group financial statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation.
We have audited the financial statements, included within the Annual Report and Accounts (the ‘Annual Report’), which comprise: 
the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position and the Company Balance Sheet at 30 September 2017; the Consolidated Income 
Statement and Statement of Comprehensive Income; the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows; and the Consolidated and 
Company Statements of Changes in Equity for the year then ended; and the notes to the financial statements, which include a 
description of the significant accounting policies.
Our opinion is consistent with our reporting to the Audit Committee.
Basis for opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK) (ISAs (UK)) and applicable law. Our 
responsibilities under ISAs (UK) are further described in the auditors’ responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements section 
of our report. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.
Independence
We remained independent of the Group in accordance with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the financial 
statements in the UK, which includes the FRC’s Ethical Standard, as applicable to listed public interest entities, and we have fulfilled 
our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements.
To the best of our knowledge and belief, we declare that non-audit services prohibited by the FRC’s Ethical Standard were not 
provided to the Group or the Company.
Other than disclosed in note 4 to the financial statements, we have provided no non-audit services to the Group or the Company in 
the period from 1 October 2016 to 30 September 2017.

The scope of our audit
As part of designing our audit, we determined materiality and assessed the risks of material misstatement in the financial 
statements. In particular, we looked at where the Directors made subjective judgements, for example in respect of significant 
accounting estimates that involved making assumptions and considering future events that are inherently uncertain. As in all of our 
audits, we also addressed the risk of management override of internal controls, including evaluating whether there was evidence 
of bias by the Directors that represented a risk of material misstatement due to fraud, and the risk of fraud in revenue recognition. 
Procedures designed to address these risks included testing of material journal entries and post-close adjustments, testing and 
evaluating management’s key accounting estimates for reasonableness and consistency, understanding and testing management 
incentive plans, undertaking cut-off procedures to test proper cut-off of revenue and expenses and testing the existence and 
accuracy of revenue transactions. 
Key audit matters
Key audit matters are those matters that, in the auditors’ professional judgement, were of most significance in the audit of the 
financial statements of the current period and include the most significant assessed risks of material misstatement (whether or not 
due to fraud) identified by the auditors, including those which had the greatest effect on: the overall audit strategy; the allocation 
of resources in the audit; and directing the efforts of the engagement team. These matters, and any comments we make on the 
results of our procedures thereon, were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming 
our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. This is not a complete list of all risks identified by 
our audit. 
Key audit matter How our audit addressed the key audit matter
Carrying values of goodwill and acquired intangibles 
assets (Group) 
Refer to the Audit Committee report on page 51 and to note 12 
to the consolidated financial statements.
At 30 September 2017, the Group had £594m of goodwill and 
intangible assets, including £189m of acquired intangibles and 
£399m of goodwill.
During the year, the Group recognised a £27.4m impairment 
charge related to goodwill for Ned Davis Research, Inc. (NDR).
Recoverability of the carrying values of goodwill and acquired 
intangible assets is contingent on future cash flows of the 
underlying cash generating units (CGUs) and there is a risk that 
if these cash flows do not meet management’s expectations the 
assets will be impaired. The cash flow forecasts and related 
value in use calculations include a number of significant 
judgements and estimates including profit growth, cash 
conversion, terminal growth rate and discount rate. Where 
businesses are held for sale, fair value less cost of disposal 
(rather than value in use) has been used to value CGUs. The 
related calculations are based on an estimate of disposal 
proceeds. Changes in the key assumptions underpinning 
these calculations have a significant impact on the headroom 
available in the impairment calculations.
We obtained management’s goodwill impairment model and 
tested the reasonableness of key assumptions, including revenue, 
profit and cash flow growth rates, terminal values and the 
selection of discount rates. We agreed the underlying cash flow 
projections to management approved budgets and forecasts 
and assessed how these projections are compiled. Deploying our 
valuations experts, we assessed the terminal growth rate and 
discount rate applied to each CGU compared with third party 
information, past performance, the Group’s cost of capital and 
relevant risk factors. We evaluated indicative offers from third 
parties where CGUs are held for sale and have therefore been 
valued on a fair value less cost of disposal basis. We performed 
our own risk assessment by considering historical performance 
and management’s forecasting accuracy by applying any 
current year budget shortfalls to future forecasts to highlight the 
CGUs with either lower headroom or which are more sensitive 
to changes in key assumptions. We focused our attention on 
those businesses where headroom has decreased or where 
management has identified impairments, namely NDR.
We performed our own independent sensitivity analysis to 
understand the impact of reasonable changes in management’s 
assumptions on the available headroom. We challenged the 
significant assumptions, specifically relating to revenue and 
profit growth in light of the individual CGU’s past performance 
to assess whether the forecasts are achievable. We focused in 
particular on the goodwill relating to NDR in order to determine 
whether we agreed with management’s decision to impair and 
whether in our view the impairment charge is sufficient. 
We checked for any additional impairment triggers in other 
businesses through discussions with management, review of 
management accounts and board minutes and examining 
performance of recent acquisitions to identify under-performing 
businesses.
As a result of our work, we determined that the impairment 
charge recognised in 2017 was appropriate. For those intangible 
assets, including goodwill, where management determined that 
no impairment was required and that no additional sensitivity 
disclosures should be given, we found that these judgements 
were supported by reasonable assumptions that would require 
significant downside changes before any additional material 
impairment was necessary.

Key audit matter How our audit addressed the key audit matter
Carrying value of investments in subsidiaries (Company)
Refer to note 6 to the Company financial statements.
Investments in subsidiaries of £1,087m are accounted for at cost 
less impairment in the Company Balance Sheet at 30 September 
2017.
Investments are tested for impairment if impairment indicators 
exist. If such indicators exist, the recoverable amounts of the 
investments in subsidiaries are estimated in order to determine 
the extent of the impairment loss, if any. Any such impairment 
loss is recognised in the income statement.
Management judgement is required in the area of impairment 
testing, particularly in assessing: (1) whether an event has 
occurred that may indicate that the related asset values may 
not be recoverable; (2) whether the carrying value of an asset 
can be supported by the recoverable amount, being the higher 
of fair value less costs to sell or the net present value of future 
cash flows which are estimated based on the continued use of 
the asset in the business; (3) the appropriate key assumptions to 
be applied in preparing cash flow projections including whether 
these cash flow projections are discounted using an appropriate 
rate. Changing the assumptions selected by management 
to determine the level, if any, of impairment, including the 
discount rates or the growth rate assumptions in the cash flow 
projections, could materially affect the net present value used 
in the impairment test and as a result affect the Company’s 
financial condition and results of operations.
We evaluated management’s assumption whether any indicators 
of impairment existed by comparing the net assets of the 
subsidiaries at 30 September 2017 with the Company’s investment 
carrying values. 
For those investments where the net assets were lower than the 
carrying values, management prepared a discounted cash flow 
model. We have tested the reasonableness of key assumptions, 
including revenue, profit and cash flow growth rates, terminal 
value and the selection of discount rates management has 
applied. We performed our own independent sensitivity 
analysis to understand the impact of reasonable changes in 
management’s assumptions on the available headroom. 
As a result of our work, we considered that the carrying values 
of the investments held by the Company are supportable in the 
context of the Company financial statements taken as a whole.
Uncertain tax positions (Group)
Refer to the Audit Committee report on page 52 and to note 2 
to the consolidated financial statements.
The Group operates in a complex multinational tax environment 
in relation to direct and indirect taxes and there are a 
number of open tax matters with tax authorities, especially 
in the UK, US and Canada. From time to time, the Group 
enters into transactions with complicated accounting and 
tax consequences and judgement is required in assessing 
the level of provisions needed in respect of uncertain tax 
positions. In addition, the Group is subject to sales taxes in the 
US. The evolving nature both of US sales tax legislation and 
of the Group’s product base as the business goes increasingly 
digital means that management periodically needs to exercise 
judgement (supported by external specialist advice) in assessing 
appropriate levels of provisioning. 
We evaluated management’s judgements in respect of estimates 
of tax exposures and contingencies in order to assess the 
adequacy of the Group’s tax provisions.
In understanding and evaluating management’s judgements, 
we deployed our tax specialists and considered third party tax 
advice received by the Group, the status of recent and current 
tax authority audits and enquiries, the outturn of previous claims, 
judgemental positions taken in tax returns and current year 
estimates and developments in the tax environment.
We refreshed our independent assessment of tax risks in the 
Group’s most material markets (UK, US and Canada) and we 
evaluated the appropriateness and completeness of related tax 
provisions. The most significant uncertain tax positions comprise 
the Canadian Revenue Agency’s assessment of a foreign currency 
trade in 2009 and HMRC’s challenge related to the Dealogic 
transaction in 2015. 
Deploying our tax specialists, we discussed tax advice received 
by the Group direct with the Group’s third party advisors in 
relation to the challenges by the Canadian Revenue Agency and 
the UK’s HMRC.
From the evidence obtained, we considered the level of 
provisioning for direct and indirect taxes and the related 
disclosures to be acceptable in the context of the consolidated 
financial statements taken as a whole.

Key audit matter How our audit addressed the key audit matter
Presentation of exceptional items (Group)
Refer to the Audit Committee report on page 51 and to note 5 to 
the consolidated financial statements.
The Group continues to present adjusted earnings by making 
adjustments for costs and profits which management believes to 
be exceptional by virtue of their size and incidence.
During the year, the Group presented £31.3m of net costs as 
exceptional items, primarily comprising: goodwill and available 
for sale investment impairments (£29.6m); other exceptional 
costs (£8.4m); offset by the release of a provision for US sales tax 
(£3.9m) and net profit on disposal or closure of businesses and 
joint ventures (£2.9m).
Given that the Group presents adjusted earnings measures in 
addition to its statutory results, we focused on the classification 
of these items as exceptional in the consolidated financial 
statements, particularly considering the nature of such items, 
whether they are non-recurring and whether they are significant 
in size.
We considered the appropriateness of the adjustments made 
to statutory profit measures to derive adjusted profit measures. 
We understood management’s rationale for classifying items 
as exceptional and considered whether this is reasonable and 
appropriate in arriving at an adjusted profit measure for 2017.
We considered the appropriateness of classifying the goodwill 
and available for sale investment impairment charges as 
exceptional. Due to their size and nature, we accepted 
management’s presentation of these items as exceptional.
We were satisfied that the release of the provision for US sales 
taxes through exceptional items was appropriate as the provision 
was originally recorded as an exceptional. Overall, we found that 
management was even handed and consistent in its treatment of 
exceptional credits and debits. 
We were satisfied that excluding the one-off net profit on 
disposal or closure of businesses and joint ventures from adjusted 
profit was consistent with the Group’s historical practice. Where 
other costs were treated as exceptional, we considered whether 
the Company had complied with its accounting policy and with 
the financial hurdle set by the Directors below which items of cost 
and income should not be treated as exceptional.
We considered the appropriateness and transparency of the 
disclosures in the consolidated financial statements regarding 
the nature of the reconciling items between statutory and 
adjusted profit measures, especially in the context of the principle 
that financial reporting as a whole should be fair, balanced and 
understandable.
As a result of our work, we determined that the classification 
of exceptional items was reasonable, that the Group’s policy in 
this area has been consistently applied and that the rationale 
for including or excluding items from adjusted profit has been 
consistently applied across gains and losses.
Acquisition accounting for RISI (Group)
Refer to the Audit Committee report on page 52 and to note 15 
to the consolidated financial statements.
On 6 April 2017, the Group acquired 100% of the equity share 
capital of RISI, the leading price reporting agency for the global 
forecast products market, for approximately £100m.
A provisional purchase price allocation exercise has been 
performed by management, assisted by an external expert. 
The primary element of the valuation exercise assessed the fair 
value of identifiable intangible assets in the form of trade name 
(£24m), customer relationships (£41m) and technology (£1m) 
along with the related tax impact (£26.6m). Goodwill of £66m 
was recognised as a result of the acquisition. 
Judgement was required in identifying and valuing these 
acquired intangible assets and goodwill and in determining the 
valuation of the other assets and liabilities acquired.
We obtained and reviewed the sale and purchase agreement 
(SPA) and due diligence reports to gain an understanding of the 
key terms of (and business rationale for) the acquisition. 
In testing the valuation of the intangible assets acquired, we 
considered whether the identified intangible assets were 
appropriate by reference to the SPA, due diligence reports and 
other supporting documentation.
Deploying our valuations experts, we engaged with 
management and with management’s third party expert to 
assess the methodology employed for calculating the fair values 
of the assets and liabilities and the appropriateness of the key 
assumptions used, including discount rates. 
We checked that the material fair value adjustments to the 
net assets were consistent with the accounting standard 
requirements. Based on the evidence obtained, we did not 
identify any indication that the fair value adjustments identified 
by management were inappropriate or that material fair value 
adjustments were omitted from management’s assessment.
We specified certain procedures for our component team 
to undertake on the opening balance sheet acquired by the 
Group. We reviewed management’s analysis of the impacts of 
the differences between RISI’s accounting policies against the 
Group’s accounting policies and noted no material differences.
We read the disclosures in the financial statements to satisfy 
ourselves that they are in line with the requirements of the 
relevant accounting standards.
As a result of our work, we determined that the acquisition 
accounting and related disclosures applied by the Group on a 
provisional basis at 30 September 2017 were appropriate.

Key audit matter How our audit addressed the key audit matter
Presentation of discontinued operations (Group)
Refer to the Audit Committee report on page 52 and to note 11 
to the consolidated financial statements.
In September 2017, the Group announced its plan to explore 
the sale of its Global Markets Intelligence Division, consisting of 
CEIC and EMIS (the ‘disposal group’) after receiving interest from 
potential buyers. 
At 30 September 2017, the sale was not completed. The disposal 
group was presented as held for sale and as a discontinued 
operation at and for the year ended 30 September 2017 in 
accordance with IFRS 5. 
Judgement was required in determining whether CEIC and 
EMIS met the IFRS 5 criteria for classification as discontinued 
operations and in assessing the disposal group for impairment.
We have examined minutes of board meetings, written 
correspondence between the Group and the potential 
purchasers and communications to the Group’s investors. We 
considered that the classification of assets and liabilities in the 
disposal group as held for sale and the results of the disposal 
group as discontinued operations is appropriate and in 
accordance with IFRS 5. 
We performed specified audit procedures over the balances 
and results of the disposal group presented separately in 
the consolidated income statement and balance sheet at 
30 September 2017, including revenue, cash, deferred revenue 
and accruals.
Furthermore, the carrying value of the assets and liabilities of the 
disposal group has been assessed by reference to the expected 
sale proceeds less estimated cost to sell. We were satisfied 
that the net assets of the disposal group were recoverable at 
30 September 2017.
We assessed the adequacy of the disclosures in the notes to 
the consolidated financial statements. We considered that the 
disclosures are appropriate. 
How we tailored the audit scope
We tailored the scope of our audit to ensure that we performed enough work to be able to give an opinion on the financial 
statements as a whole, taking into account the structure of the Group and the Company, the industry in which they operate and the 
accounting processes and controls.
The consolidated financial statements are a consolidation of 87 reporting units, each of which is considered to be a component. 
We identified four components in the UK, US and Canada that required a full scope audit due to their size. Audit procedures 
over specific financial statement line items were performed at a further four components in the UK and US to give sufficient audit 
coverage. 
In establishing the overall approach to the Group audit, we determined the type of work that needed to be performed at the 
components by us, as the Group audit team, or component auditors within PwC UK and from other PwC network firms operating 
under our instruction. Where the work was performed by component auditors, we determined the level of involvement we needed 
to have in the audit work at those reporting units to be able to conclude whether sufficient appropriate audit evidence had been 
obtained as a basis for our opinion on the consolidated financial statements as a whole.
We performed full scope audits in respect of Euromoney Trading Limited (UK), Euromoney Global Limited (UK), Institutional Investor, 
Inc. (US) and BCA Research, Inc. (Canada) which, in our view, required a full scope audit due to their size.
We performed specified procedures at RISI, Inc. over revenue, trade and other receivables and deferred income, at Fantfoot 
Limited and Euromoney Canada Limited over cash and cash equivalents, loan notes and borrowings and at Tipall Limited over 
property, plant and equipment. This ensured that sufficient and appropriate audit procedures were performed to achieve sufficient 
coverage over these financial statement line items.
In addition to instructing and reviewing the reporting from our component audit teams, we conducted visits to our full scope 
components in the US and Canada, which included file reviews and attendance at key meetings with local management. We also 
had regular dialogue with component teams throughout the year.
The Group consolidation, financial statement disclosures and corporate functions were audited by the Group audit team. This 
included our work over goodwill and intangible assets, acquisitions and disposals, treasury, post-retirement benefits, share-based 
payments and tax.
Taken together, the components and corporate functions where we conducted audit procedures accounted for approximately 
76% of the Group’s revenue, 83% of the Group’s statutory profit before tax and 91% of the Group’s statutory profit before tax from 
continuing and discontinued operations, adjusted for certain exceptional items. This provided the evidence we needed for our 
opinion on the consolidated financial statements taken as a whole. This was before considering the contribution to our audit 
evidence from performing audit work at the Group level, including disaggregated analytical review procedures, which covers 
certain of the Group’s smaller and lower risk components that were not directly included in our Group audit scope.
Materiality
The scope of our audit was influenced by our application of materiality. We set certain quantitative thresholds for materiality. 
These, together with qualitative considerations, helped us to determine the scope of our audit and the nature, timing and extent of 
our audit procedures on the individual financial statement line items and disclosures and in evaluating the effect of misstatements, 
both individually and in aggregate on the financial statements as a whole.

Based on our professional judgement, we determined materiality for the financial statements as a whole as follows:
 Group financial statements Company financial statements
Overall materiality £4.2m (2016: £4.1m). £13.5m (2016: £3.7m).
How we  
determined it
5% of statutory profit before tax for continuing and discontinued 
operations, adjusted for certain exceptional items.
1% of total assets.
Rationale for 
benchmark applied
The Group’s principal measure of earnings comprises adjusted operating 
profit, which adjusts statutory profit for a number of income and 
expenditure items. Management uses this measure as it believes that 
it eliminates the volatility inherent in exceptional items. We have taken 
this measure into account in determining our materiality, except that we 
have not adjusted profit before tax to add back amortisation of acquired 
intangible assets, share of results in associates and joint ventures or 
net finance costs as in our view these are recurring items which do not 
introduce volatility to the Group’s earnings.
The CEIC and EMIS businesses that are classified as discontinued 
operations contributed a full year’s results and remained part of the 
Group at 30 September 2017. In our view, it is therefore appropriate to 
continue to take the profit from discontinued operations into account when 
determining our materiality.
Based on our professional 
judgement, total assets is 
an appropriate measure to 
assess the performance of the 
Company and is a generally 
accepted auditing benchmark 
for holding companies.
For each component in the scope of our Group audit, we allocated a materiality that is less than our overall Group materiality. 
The range of materiality allocated across components was between £0.2m and £3.9m. Certain components were audited to local 
statutory audit materiality levels that were also less than our overall Group materiality.
We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to them misstatements identified during our audit above £200,000 
for the Group and Company audits (2016: £200,000) as well as misstatements below those amounts that, in our view, warranted 
reporting for qualitative reasons.
Going concern
In accordance with ISAs (UK) we report as follows:
Reporting obligation Outcome
We are required to report if we have anything material to add or draw attention 
to in respect of the Directors’ statement in the financial statements whether the 
Directors considered it appropriate to adopt the going concern basis of accounting 
in preparing the financial statements and the Directors’ identification of any material 
uncertainties to the Group’s and the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern 
over a period of at least twelve months from the date of approval of the financial 
statements.
We have nothing material to add or to 
draw attention to. However, because 
not all future events or conditions can be 
predicted, this statement is not a guarantee 
as to the Group’s and Company’s ability to 
continue as a going concern.
We are required to report if the Directors’ statement relating to going concern in 
accordance with Listing Rule 9.8.6R(3) is materially inconsistent with our knowledge 
obtained in the audit.
We have nothing to report.

Independent Auditors’ Report
to the members of Euromoney Institutional Investor PLC continued
Reporting on other information 
The other information comprises all of the information in the Annual Report other than the financial statements and our Auditors’ 
Report thereon. The Directors are responsible for the other information. Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the 
other information and, accordingly, we do not express an audit opinion or, except to the extent otherwise explicitly stated in this 
report, any form of assurance thereon. 
In connection with our audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider 
whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit, or 
otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If we identify an apparent material inconsistency or material misstatement, we are 
required to perform procedures to conclude whether there is a material misstatement of the financial statements or a material 
misstatement of the other information. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement 
of this other information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report based on these responsibilities.
With respect to the Strategic Report and Directors’ Report, we also considered whether the disclosures required by the UK 
Companies Act 2006 have been included. 
Based on the responsibilities described above and our work undertaken in the course of the audit, the Companies Act 2006, (CA06), 
ISAs (UK) and the Listing Rules of the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) require us also to report certain opinions and matters as 
described below (required by ISAs (UK) unless otherwise stated).
Strategic Report and Directors’ Report
In our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of the audit, the information given in the Strategic Report and Directors’ 
Report for the year ended 30 September 2017 is consistent with the financial statements and has been prepared in accordance with 
applicable legal requirements. (CA06)
In light of the knowledge and understanding of the Group and Company and their environment obtained in the course of the audit, 
we did not identify any material misstatements in the Strategic Report and Directors’ Report. (CA06)
The Directors’ assessment of the prospects of the Group and of the principal risks that would threaten the solvency 
or liquidity of the Group
We have nothing material to add or draw attention to regarding:
• The Directors’ confirmation on page 57 of the Annual Report that they have carried out a robust assessment of the principal risks facing 
the Group, including those that would threaten its business model, future performance, solvency or liquidity.
• The disclosures in the Annual Report that describe those risks and explain how they are being managed or mitigated.
• The Directors’ explanation on page 39 of the Annual Report how they have assessed the prospects of the Group, over what period they 
have done so and why they consider that period to be appropriate and their statement whether they have a reasonable expectation 
that the Group will be able to continue in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due over the period of their assessment, including 
any related disclosures drawing attention to any necessary qualifications or assumptions.
We have nothing to report having performed a review of the Directors’ statement that they have carried out a robust assessment of 
the principal risks facing the Group and statement in relation to the longer-term viability of the Group. Our review was substantially 
less in scope than an audit and only consisted of making inquiries and considering the Directors’ process supporting their 
statements; checking that the statements are in alignment with the relevant provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code (the 
‘Code’); and considering whether the statements are consistent with the knowledge and understanding of the Group and Company 
and their environment obtained in the course of the audit. (Listing Rules)
Other Code Provisions
We have nothing to report in respect of our responsibility to report when: 
• The statement given by the Directors, on pages 56 and 57, that they consider the Annual Report taken as a whole to be fair, balanced 
and understandable, and provides the information necessary for the members to assess the Group’s and Company’s position and 
performance, business model and strategy is materially inconsistent with our knowledge of the Group and Company obtained in the 
course of performing our audit.
• The section of the Annual Report on pages 51 and 52 describing the work of the Audit Committee does not appropriately address 
matters communicated by us to the Audit Committee.
• The Directors’ statement relating to the Company’s compliance with the Code does not properly disclose a departure from a relevant 
provision of the Code specified, under the Listing Rules, for review by the auditors.
Directors’ Remuneration
In our opinion, the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited has been properly prepared in accordance with the 
Companies Act 2006. (CA06)

Responsibilities for the ﬁnancial statements and the audit
Responsibilities of the Directors for the financial statements
As explained more fully in the Directors’ Responsibilities Statement set out on pages 56 and 57, the Directors are responsible for the 
preparation of the financial statements in accordance with the applicable framework and for being satisfied that they give a true 
and fair view. The Directors are also responsible for such internal control as they determine is necessary to enable the preparation 
of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
In preparing the financial statements, the Directors are responsible for assessing the Group’s and the Company’s ability to continue 
as a going concern, disclosing as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting 
unless the Directors either intend to liquidate the Group or the Company or to cease operations or have no realistic alternative but 
to do so.
Auditors’ responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material 
misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an Auditors’ Report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a 
high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs (UK) will always detect a material 
misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the 
aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial 
statements. 
A further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements is located on the FRC’s website at: 
www.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities. This description forms part of our Auditors’ Report.
Use of this report
This report, including the opinions, has been prepared for and only for the Company’s members as a body in accordance with 
Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006 and for no other purpose. We do not, in giving these opinions, accept or assume 
responsibility for any other purpose or to any other person to whom this report is shown or into whose hands it may come save 
where expressly agreed by our prior consent in writing.
Other required reporting
Companies Act 2006 exception reporting
Under the Companies Act 2006, we are required to report to you if, in our opinion:
• we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit; or
• adequate accounting records have not been kept by the Company or returns adequate for our audit have not been received from 
branches not visited by us; or
• certain disclosures of Directors’ remuneration specified by law are not made; or
• the Company financial statements and the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited are not in agreement with the 
accounting records and returns. 
We have no exceptions to report arising from this responsibility. 
Appointment
Following the recommendation of the Audit Committee, we were appointed by the members on 29 January 2015 to audit the 
financial statements for the year ended 30 September 2015. The period of total uninterrupted engagement is three years, covering 
the years ended 30 September 2015 to 30 September 2017.

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements
1 Accounting policies
General information
Euromoney Institutional Investor PLC (the ‘Company’) is a public 
company limited by shares and incorporated in England and 
Wales, United Kingdom (UK). The address of the registered 
office is 8 Bouverie Street, London, EC4Y 8AX, UK.
The Group financial statements consolidate those of the 
Company and its subsidiaries (together referred to as the 
‘Group’) and equity account the Group’s interest in associates 
and joint ventures. The parent Company financial statements 
present information about the entity and not about its Group.
The Group financial statements have been prepared and 
approved by the Directors in accordance with the International 
Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) adopted for use in 
the European Union and interpretations issued by the IFRS 
Interpretations Committee (IFRS IC) and therefore comply with 
Article 4 of the EU IAS Regulation. The Company has elected to 
prepare its parent Company financial statements in accordance 
with Financial Reporting Standard 102.
Judgements made by the Directors in the application of those 
accounting policies that have a significant effect on the 
financial statements, and estimates with a significant risk of 
material adjustment in the next year, are discussed in note 2.
Certain changes to IFRS will be applicable to the Group 
financial statements in future years. Set out below are those 
which are considered to be most relevant to the Group.
Relevant new standards, amendments and 
interpretations issued but effective subsequent to the 
year end:
• IFRS 9 ‘Financial Instruments’ – the mandatory effective date of 
implementation is 1 January 2018
• IFRS 15 ‘Revenue from Contracts with Customers’ – the mandatory 
effective date of implementation is 1 January 2018
• IFRS 16 ‘Leases’ – subject to EU endorsement, the mandatory 
effective date of implementation is 1 January 2019
• Amendments to IAS 12 ‘Income Taxes’ – the mandatory effective 
date of implementation is 1 January 2017
• Amendments to IAS 7 ‘Statement of Cash Flows’ – the mandatory 
effective date of implementation is 1 January 2017
Other than IFRS 16, the adoption of these standards, 
amendments and interpretations is not expected to have 
a material impact on the Group’s financial statements. The 
Directors are in the process of evaluating the impact of these 
standards. The Group will adopt IFRS 9 and IFRS 15 with effect 
from 1 October 2018 and IFRS 16 with effect from 1 October 2019.
IFRS 9: Adopting IFRS 9 ‘Financial Instruments’ will impact 
hedge accounting and receivables provisioning. The basis 
of documentation and effectiveness testing of hedges 
under the new standard will be linked more closely to the 
risk management objectives, which may generate different 
levels of ineffectiveness than the current testing under IAS 39. 
Receivables provisioning will move from an incurred to an 
expected loss model. The Group’s largest exposure is trade 
receivables, which had a gross value of £50.9m at 30 September 
2017. No material impact is anticipated for high credit quality 
balances settled on agreed terms. However, the new model 
could impact the timing and value of provision recognition on 
higher risk balances. The Group has available-for-sale financial 
assets recognised at cost and is evaluating the impact of IFRS 9 
on this treatment.
IFRS 15: Management is evaluating the impact of ‘IFRS 15 
Revenue from Contracts with Customers’ at contract level 
to confirm the full impact of adopting this standard. The 
implementation of IFRS 15 is complex due to the Group’s large 
number of revenue streams. IFRS 15 could impact the timing 
of revenue recognition due to enhanced guidance around 
performance obligations and timing of revenue recognition. 
Management favours the modified retrospective transition 
method. This method recognises the cumulative effect of initially 
applying IFRS 15 as an adjustment to the opening balance sheet 
in the period of initial application and comparative periods 
would not be adjusted.
Basis of preparation
The accounts have been prepared under the historical cost 
convention, except for certain financial instruments which have 
been measured at fair value. The accounting policies set out 
below have been applied consistently to all periods presented 
in these Group financial statements. Having assessed the 
principal risks and the other matters discussed in connection 
with the viability statement, the Directors consider it appropriate 
to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing 
this Annual Report.
Following the Group’s decision to explore the strategic 
options for the Global Markets Intelligence Division (CEIC 
and EMIS), these businesses have met the recognition criteria 
of discontinued operations under IFRS 5 ‘Non-current assets 
held for sale and discontinued operations’ and are therefore 
presented as such throughout this report. In order to comply with 
this presentation, the 2016 Income Statement disclosures have 
been re-presented separating continuing and discontinued 
operations.
Following a review of the Consolidated Statement of 
Comprehensive Income, the Group has revised 2016 
comparatives to ensure consistent and appropriate 
classification. This reclassification has no impact on the total 
comprehensive income for 2016 but increases the change in fair 
value of cash flow hedges by £4.1m from a loss of £5.2m to a 
loss of £9.3m with a corresponding adjustment to the transfer of 
gains/losses on cash flow hedges from fair value reserves to the 
Income Statement from a transfer of gains of £2.1m to a transfer 
of losses of £2.0m.
Advertising revenues for 2016 have been restated by £1.3m to 
include consulting income which was previously reported as 
part of delegates revenue.
(a) Subsidiaries
The consolidated accounts incorporate the accounts of 
the Company and entities controlled by the Company (its 
‘subsidiaries’). The Group controls an entity when the Group is 
exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from its involvement 
with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through 
its power over the entity. Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from 
the date on which control is transferred to the Group. They are 
deconsolidated from the date that control ceases.
Intercompany transactions, balances and unrealised gains 
and losses on transactions between Group companies are 
eliminated.

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements
Continued
1 Accounting policies continued
The Group uses the acquisition method of accounting to 
account for business combinations. The amount recognised 
as consideration by the Group equates to the fair value 
of the assets, liabilities and equity acquired by the Group 
plus contingent consideration (should there be any such 
arrangement). Acquisition related costs are expensed as 
incurred. Identifiable assets acquired and liabilities and 
contingent liabilities assumed in a business combination are 
measured initially at their fair values at acquisition. Non-
controlling interests are measured initially at their proportionate 
share of the acquiree’s identifiable net assets at the date of 
acquisition.
To the extent the consideration (including the assumed 
contingent consideration) provided by the acquirer is greater 
than the fair value of the assets and liabilities, this amount 
is recognised as goodwill. Goodwill also incorporates the 
amount of any non-controlling interest in the acquiree and 
the acquisition date fair value of any previous equity interest 
in the acquiree over the fair value of the Group’s share of the 
identifiable net assets acquired. If this consideration is lower 
than the fair value of the net assets of the subsidiary acquired, 
the difference is recognised as ‘negative goodwill’ directly in the 
Income Statement.
If the initial accounting for a business combination is incomplete 
by the end of the reporting period in which the combination 
occurs, the Group reports provisional amounts for the items for 
which the accounting is incomplete. Those provisional amounts 
are adjusted during the measurement period, or additional 
asset and liabilities are recognised to reflect new information 
obtained about facts and circumstances that existed as of the 
date of the acquisition that, if known, would have affected the 
amounts recognised as of that date.
The measurement period is the period from the date of 
acquisition to the date the Group obtains complete information 
about facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition 
date and is a maximum of one year.
Partial acquisitions – control unaffected
Where the Group acquires an additional interest in an entity in 
which a controlling interest is already held, the consideration 
paid for the additional interest is reflected within movements in 
equity as a reduction in non-controlling interests. No goodwill is 
recognised.
Step acquisitions – control passes to the Group
Where a business combination is achieved in stages, at the 
stage at which control passes to the Group, the previously held 
interest is treated as if it had been disposed of, along with the 
consideration paid for the controlling interest in the subsidiary. 
The fair value of the previously held interest then forms one of 
the components that is used to calculate goodwill, along with 
the consideration and the non-controlling interest less the fair 
value of identifiable net assets. The consideration paid for the 
earlier stages of a step acquisition, before control passes to the 
Group, is treated as an investment in an associate.
(b) Transactions with non-controlling interests
Transactions with non-controlling interests in the net assets of 
consolidated subsidiaries are identified separately and included 
in the Group’s equity. Non-controlling interests consist of the 
amount of those interests at the date of the original business 
combination and its share of changes in equity since the date 
of the combination. Total comprehensive income is attributed to 
non-controlling interests even if this results in the non-controlling 
interests having a deficit balance.
(c) Interests in joint ventures and associates
A joint venture is a contractual arrangement whereby the 
Group and other parties undertake an economic activity that is 
subject to joint control, that is, when the strategic financial and 
operating policy decisions relating to the activities require the 
unanimous consent of the parties sharing control.
An associate is an entity over which the Group has significant 
influence and that is neither a subsidiary nor an interest in a joint 
venture. Significant influence is the power to participate in the 
financial and operating policy decisions of the investee, but is 
not control or joint control over those policies.
The post-tax results of joint ventures and associates are 
incorporated in the Group’s results using the equity method 
of accounting. Under the equity method, investments in joint 
ventures and associates are carried in the Consolidated 
Statement of Financial Position at cost as adjusted for post-
acquisition changes in the Group’s share of the net assets of the 
joint venture and associates, less any impairment in the value of 
the investment. Losses of joint ventures and associates in excess 
of the Group’s interest in that joint venture or associate are not 
recognised. Additional losses are provided for, and a liability is 
recognised, only to the extent that the Group has incurred legal 
or constructive obligations or made payments on behalf of the 
joint venture or associate.
Any excess of the cost of acquisition over the Group’s share of the 
net fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent 
liabilities of the joint venture or associate recognised at the 
date of acquisition is recognised as goodwill. The goodwill is 
included within the carrying amount of the investment.
Non-current assets classified as held for sale
Where the carrying value of a non-current asset is expected to 
be principally recovered through its sale, the asset is classified 
as held for sale if it also meets the following:
• the asset is available for sale in its current condition;
• the sale is highly probable; and
• the sale is expected to occur within one year.
Once classified as held for sale, the asset is held at the lower 
of its carrying value and the fair value less cost to sell and is no 
longer depreciated.
Discontinued operations
A discontinued operation is a component of the Group’s 
business, the operations and cash flows of which can be clearly 
distinguished from the rest of the Group and which:
• represents a separate major line of business or geographic area 
of operations;
• is part of a single co-ordinated plan to dispose of a separate 
major line of business or geographic area of operations; or
• is a subsidiary acquired exclusively with a view to re-sale.
Classification as a discontinued operation occurs at the earlier 
of disposal or when the operation meets the criteria to be 
classified as held-for-sale.
When an operation is classified as a discontinued operation, 
the comparative Income Statement and other comprehensive 
income is re-presented as if the operation had been 
discontinued from the start of the comparative year.

Foreign currencies
Functional and presentation currency
The functional and presentation currency of Euromoney 
Institutional Investor PLC and its UK subsidiaries, other than 
Fantfoot Limited, Centre for Investor Education (UK) Limited and 
Redquince Limited, is sterling. The functional currency of other 
subsidiaries, associates, joint ventures and available-for-sale 
investments is the currency of the primary economic environment 
in which they operate.
Transactions and balances
Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded at the rate 
of exchange ruling at the date of the transaction. Monetary 
assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are 
translated into sterling at the rates ruling at the balance sheet 
date. Gains and losses arising on foreign currency borrowings 
and derivative instruments, to the extent that they are used 
to provide a hedge against the Group’s equity investments 
in overseas undertakings, are taken to other comprehensive 
income together with the exchange difference arising on the net 
investment in those undertakings. All other exchange differences 
are taken to the Income Statement.
On consolidation, exchange differences arising from the 
translations of the net investment in foreign entities and 
borrowings and other currency instruments designated as 
hedges of such investments are taken to other comprehensive 
income. The Group treats specific inter-company loan balances, 
which are not intended to be repaid in the foreseeable future, 
as part of its net investment.
Group companies 
The Income Statements of overseas operations are translated 
into sterling at the weighted average exchange rates for the 
year and their balance sheets are translated into sterling 
at the exchange rates ruling at the balance sheet date. All 
exchange differences arising on consolidation are taken to 
other comprehensive income. In the event of the disposal of an 
operation, the related cumulative translation differences are 
recognised in the Income Statement in the period of disposal.
Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less 
accumulated depreciation and any recognised impairment loss.
Depreciation of property, plant and equipment is provided on a 
straight-line basis over their expected useful lives as follows:
Long-term leasehold premises over term of lease
Short-term leasehold premises over term of lease
Plant and equipment 3 – 25 years 
Intangible assets
Goodwill
Goodwill represents the excess of the fair value of purchase 
consideration over the net fair value of identifiable assets and 
liabilities acquired.
Goodwill is recognised as an asset at cost and subsequently 
measured at cost less accumulated impairment. For the 
purposes of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to those 
cash generating units that have benefited from the acquisition. 
Assets are grouped at the lowest level for which there are 
separately identifiable cash flows. The carrying value of 
goodwill is reviewed for impairment at least annually or where 
there is an indication that goodwill may be impaired. If the 
recoverable amount of the cash generating unit is less than its 
carrying amount, then the impairment loss is allocated first to 
reduce the carrying amount of the goodwill allocated to the unit 
and then to the other assets of the unit on a pro rata basis. Any 
impairment is recognised immediately in the Income Statement 
and may not subsequently be reversed. On disposal of a 
subsidiary undertaking, the attributable amount of goodwill is 
included in the determination of the profit and loss on disposal.
Goodwill arising on foreign subsidiary investments held in the 
Statement of Financial Position are retranslated into sterling 
at the applicable period end exchange rates. Any exchange 
differences arising are taken directly to other comprehensive 
income as part of the retranslation of the net assets of the 
subsidiary.
Goodwill arising on acquisitions before the date of transition 
to IFRS has been retained at the previous UK GAAP amounts 
having been tested for impairment at that date. Goodwill 
written off to reserves under UK GAAP before 1 October 1998 
has not been reinstated and is not included in determining any 
subsequent profit or loss on disposal.
Internally generated intangible assets
An internally generated intangible asset arising from the Group’s 
software and systems development is recognised only if all of 
the following conditions are met:
• An asset is created that can be identified (such as software or a 
website);
• It is probable that the asset created will generate future 
economic benefits; and
• The development cost of the asset can be measured reliably.
Internally generated intangible assets are recognised at cost 
and amortised on a straight-line basis over the useful lives 
from the date the asset becomes usable. Where no internally 
generated intangible asset can be recognised, development 
expenditure is charged to the Income Statement in the period in 
which it is incurred.
Other intangible assets
For all other intangible assets, the Group initially makes an 
assessment of their fair value at acquisition. An intangible asset 
will be recognised as long as the asset is separable or arises 
from contractual or other legal rights, and its fair value can be 
measured reliably.
Subsequent to acquisition, amortisation is charged so as to 
write off the costs of other intangible assets over their estimated 
useful lives, using a straight-line or reducing balance method. 
These intangible assets are reviewed for impairment as 
described below.
These intangibles are stated at cost less accumulated 
amortisation and impairment losses.
Amortisation
Amortisation of intangible assets is provided on a reducing 
balance basis or straight-line basis as appropriate over their 
expected useful lives as follows:
Trademarks and brands 5 – 30 years 
Customer relationships 1 – 16 years 
Databases 1 – 22 years 
Licences and software 3 – 5 years

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements
Continued
1 Accounting policies continued
Impairment of non-financial assets
Assets that have an indefinite useful life – for example, goodwill 
or intangible assets not ready to use – are not subject to 
amortisation and are tested annually for impairment. Assets 
that are subject to amortisation are reviewed for impairment 
whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the 
carrying amount may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is 
recognised for the amount by which the asset’s carrying amount 
exceeds its recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is the 
higher of an asset’s fair value less costs to sell or value in use. 
For the purposes of assessing impairment, assets are grouped 
at the lowest levels for which there are separately identifiable 
cash flows (cash generating units). Non-financial assets, other 
than goodwill, that suffer impairment are reviewed for possible 
reversal of the impairment at each reporting date.
Trade and other receivables
Trade receivables are recognised and carried at original invoice 
amount, less provision for impairment. A provision is made 
and charged to the Income Statement when there is objective 
evidence that the Group will not be able to collect all amounts 
due in accordance to the original terms. More information on 
impairment is included in the impairment of financial assets 
section below.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents include cash, short-term deposits 
and other short-term highly liquid investments with an original 
maturity of three months or less. For the purpose of the 
Statement of Cash Flows, cash and cash equivalents are as 
defined above, net of outstanding bank overdrafts.
Financial assets
The Group classifies its financial assets into the following 
categories: financial assets at fair value through profit or loss, 
loans and receivables, and available-for-sale financial assets. 
The classification depends on the purpose for which the assets 
were acquired. Management determines the classification of its 
assets on initial recognition and re-evaluates this designation 
at every reporting date. Financial assets in the following 
categories are classified as current assets if expected to be 
settled within 12 months; otherwise, they are classified as non-
current.
Classification
Financial assets at fair value through profit and loss
Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss are financial 
assets held for trading. A financial asset is classified in this 
category if acquired principally for the purpose of selling in the 
short term or if so designated by management. Derivatives are 
also categorised as held for trading unless they are designated 
as hedges.
Loans and receivables
Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with 
fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active 
market. The Group’s loans and receivables comprise trade 
and other receivables and cash and cash equivalents in the 
Statement of Financial Position.
Available-for-sale (AFS) financial assets
AFS financial assets are non-derivatives that are either 
designated in this category or not classified in any of the other 
categories.
Recognition and measurement
Regular purchases and sales of financial assets are recognised 
on the date on which the Group commits to purchase or sell the 
asset. The Group derecognises financial assets when it ceases 
to be a party to such arrangements. All financial assets, other 
than those carried at fair value through profit or loss, are initially 
recognised at fair value plus transaction costs.
Financial assets at fair value through profit and loss
Financial assets carried at fair value through profit or loss are 
initially recognised at fair value, and transaction costs are 
expensed in the profit and loss component of the Statement 
of Comprehensive Income. Gains and losses arising from 
changes in the fair value of the ‘financial assets at fair value 
through profit or loss category’ are included in the profit and 
loss component of the Statement of Comprehensive Income in 
the period in which they arise. Dividend income from assets, 
categorised as financial assets at fair value through profit 
or loss, is recognised in the profit and loss component of the 
Statement of Comprehensive Income as part of other income 
when the Group’s right to receive payments is established.
Loans and receivables
Loans and receivables are carried at amortised cost using the 
effective interest method.
Available-for-sale (AFS) financial assets
AFS financial assets are subsequently measured at fair value 
where it can be measured reliably. AFS equity investments that 
do not have a quoted market price in an active market and 
whose fair value cannot be reliably measured are measured at 
cost less any identified impairment losses.
Offsetting financial instruments
Financial assets and liabilities are offset and the net amount 
reported in the Statement of Financial Position when there is a 
legally enforceable right to offset the recognised amounts and 
there is an intention to settle on a net basis or realise the asset 
and settle the liability simultaneously.
Impairment of financial assets
The Group assesses at each reporting period whether there is 
objective evidence that a financial asset or a group of financial 
assets is impaired. A financial asset or a group of financial 
assets is impaired and impairment losses are incurred only if 
there is objective evidence of impairment as a result of one 
or more events that occurred after the initial recognition of 
the asset (a ‘loss event’) and that loss event (or events) has an 
impact on the estimated future cash flows of the financial asset 
or group of financial assets that can be reliably estimated.
The criteria that the Group uses to determine that there is 
objective evidence of an impairment loss include:
• significant financial difficulty of the issuer or obligor;
• a breach of contract, such as a default or delinquency in interest 
or principal payments;
• the Group, for economic or legal reasons relating to the 
borrower’s financial difficulty, granting to the borrower a 
concession that the lender would not otherwise consider;
• it becomes probable that the borrower will enter bankruptcy or 
other financial reorganisation;
• the disappearance of an active market for that financial asset 
because of financial difficulties; or

• observable data indicating that there is a measurable decrease 
in the estimate of future cash flows from a portfolio of financial 
assets since the initial recognition of those assets, although the 
decrease cannot yet be identified with the individual financial 
assets in the portfolio, including:
i. adverse changes in the payment status of borrowers in the 
portfolio; and
ii. national or local economic conditions that correlate with 
defaults on the assets in the portfolio.
The Group first assesses whether objective evidence of 
impairment exists.
The amount of the loss is measured as the difference between 
the asset’s carrying amount and the present value of estimated 
future cash flows (excluding future credit losses that have not 
been incurred) discounted at the financial asset’s original 
effective interest rate. The asset’s carrying amount is reduced 
and the amount of the loss is recognised in the profit and loss 
component of the Statement of Comprehensive Income. If a loan 
has a variable interest rate, the discount rate for measuring any 
impairment loss is the current effective interest rate determined 
under the contract.
If the asset’s carrying amount is reduced, the amount of the loss 
is recognised in the profit and loss component of the Statement 
of Comprehensive Income.
If in a subsequent period, the amount of the impairment loss 
decreases and the decrease can be related objectively to an 
event occurring after the impairment was recognised (such as 
an improvement in the debtor’s credit rating), the reversal of the 
previously recognised impairment loss is recognised in the profit 
and loss component of the Statement of Comprehensive Income.
Financial liabilities
Recognition
Financial liabilities are recognised when the Group becomes 
a party to the contractual provisions of the relevant instrument. 
The Group derecognises financial liabilities when it ceases to be 
a party to such provisions.
Committed borrowings and bank overdrafts
Interest-bearing loans and overdrafts are recorded at the 
amounts received, net of direct issue costs. Direct issue costs are 
amortised over the period of the loans and overdrafts to which 
they relate. Finance charges, including premiums payable on 
settlement or redemption are charged to the Income Statement 
as incurred using the effective interest rate method and are 
added to the carrying value of the borrowings or overdraft to 
the extent they are not settled in the period in which they arise.
Trade payables and accruals
Trade payables and accruals are not interest-bearing and are 
held at amortised cost.
Derivative financial instruments
The Group uses various derivative financial instruments to 
manage its exposure to foreign exchange and interest rate risks, 
including forward foreign currency contracts and interest rate 
swaps. The Group does not hold or issue derivative financial 
instruments for trading or speculative purposes.
All derivative instruments are recorded in the Statement of 
Financial Position at fair value. Changes in the fair value 
of derivative instruments which do not qualify for hedge 
accounting are recognised immediately in the Income 
Statement.
Where the derivative instruments do qualify for hedge 
accounting, the following treatments are applied:
Fair value hedges
Changes in the fair value of the hedging instrument are 
recognised in the Income Statement for the year together with 
the changes in the fair value of the hedged item due to the 
hedged risk, to the extent the hedge is effective. When the 
hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated, or exercised, 
or no longer qualifies for hedge accounting, hedge accounting 
is discontinued.
Cash flow hedges
Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments that 
are designated and effective as hedges of future cash flows 
are recognised directly in other comprehensive income and 
the ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the Income 
Statement.
If a hedged firm commitment or forecast transaction results 
in the recognition of a non-financial asset or liability, then, at 
the time that the asset or liability is recognised, the associated 
gains and losses on the derivative that had previously been 
recognised in equity are included in the initial measurement of 
the asset or liability.
For hedges that do not result in the recognition of an asset or 
a liability, amounts deferred in equity are recognised in the 
Income Statement in the same period in which the hedged item 
affects the Income Statement.
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument 
expires or is sold, terminated, exercised, revoked, or no longer 
qualifies for hedge accounting. At that time, any cumulative 
gain or loss on the hedging instrument recognised in equity 
is retained in equity until the forecast transaction occurs. If 
a hedged transaction is no longer expected to occur, the 
net cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in equity is 
included in the Income Statement for the period.
Net investment hedges
Exchange differences arising from the translation of the net 
investment in foreign operations are recognised directly 
in other comprehensive income in the translation reserve. 
Gains and losses arising from changes in the fair value of the 
hedging instruments are recognised in other comprehensive 
income to the extent that the hedging relationship is effective. 
Any ineffectiveness is recognised immediately in the Income 
Statement for the period.
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument 
expires or is sold, terminated or exercised, or no longer qualifies 
for hedge accounting. Gains and losses accumulated in the 
translation reserve are included in the Income Statement on 
disposal of the foreign operation.
Liabilities in respect of acquisition commitments and 
deferred consideration
Liabilities for acquisition commitments over the remaining 
minority interests in subsidiaries and deferred consideration 
are recorded in the Statement of Financial Position at their 
estimated discounted present value. These discounts are 
unwound and charged to the Income Statement as notional 
interest over the period up to the date of the potential future 
payment.
Taxation
The tax expense for the period comprises current and deferred 
tax. Tax is recognised in the Income Statement, except to the 
extent that it relates to items recognised in other comprehensive 
income or directly in equity.

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements
Continued
1 Accounting policies continued
Current tax, including UK corporation tax and foreign tax, is 
provided at amounts expected to be paid (or recovered) using 
the tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively 
enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred taxation is calculated under the provisions of IAS 12 
‘Income Tax’ and is recognised on differences between the 
carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the accounts and 
the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable 
profit, and is accounted for using the balance sheet liability 
method. Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable 
temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised 
to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be 
available against which deductible temporary differences can 
be utilised. No provision is made for temporary differences 
on unremitted earnings of foreign subsidiaries or associates 
where the Group has control and the reversal of the temporary 
difference is not foreseeable.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each 
balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no 
longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available 
to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered. Deferred tax 
is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the 
period when the liability is settled or the asset is realised based 
on tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively 
enacted by the balance sheet date. Deferred tax is charged or 
credited in the Income Statement, except when it relates to items 
charged or credited directly to Statement of Comprehensive 
Income and equity, in which case the deferred tax is also dealt 
with in Statement of Comprehensive Income and equity.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a 
legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets against 
current tax liabilities and when they relate to income taxes 
levied by the same taxation authority and the Group intends to 
settle its current assets and liabilities on a net basis.
Actual tax liabilities or refunds may differ from those anticipated 
due to changes in tax legislation, differing interpretations of 
tax legislation and uncertainties surrounding the application of 
tax legislation. In situations where uncertainties exist, provision 
is made for contingent tax liabilities and assets when it is 
more likely than not that there will be a cash impact. These 
provisions are made for each uncertainty individually on the 
basis of management judgement following consideration of the 
available relevant information. The measurement basis adopted 
represents the best predictor of the resolution of the uncertainty 
which is usually based on the most likely cash outflow. The 
Company reviews the adequacy of these provisions at the end 
of each reporting period and adjusts them based on changing 
facts and circumstances. The Group does not consider 
detection risk when making its estimates.
Provisions
A provision is recognised in the balance sheet when the Group 
has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of a 
past event, and it is probable that economic benefits will be 
required to settle the obligation. If material, provisions are 
determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at a 
pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time 
value of money and, where appropriate, the risks specific to the 
liability.
Pensions
Contributions to pension schemes in respect of current and 
past service, ex gratia pensions, and cost of living adjustments 
to existing pensions are based on the advice of independent 
actuaries.
Defined contribution plans
Payments to the defined contribution pension plan are charged 
to the Income Statement as they fall due.
Defined benefit plans
Defined benefit plans define an amount of pension benefit 
that an employee will receive on retirement, usually dependent 
on one or more factors such as age, years of service and 
compensation.
The liability recognised in the Statement of Financial Position in 
respect of the defined benefit pension plan is the present value 
of the defined benefit obligation at the end of the reporting 
period less the fair value of plan assets. The defined benefit 
obligation is calculated annually by independent actuaries 
using the projected credit method. The present value of the 
defined benefit obligation is determined by discounting the 
estimated future cash outflows using interest rates of high-
quality corporate bonds that are denominated in the currency in 
which the benefits will be paid, and that have terms to maturity 
approximating to the terms of the related pension obligation. 
The actuarial valuations are obtained at least triennially and 
are updated at each balance sheet date.
Actuarial gains and losses arising from experience adjustments 
and changes in actuarial assumptions are recognised in full in 
the Statement of Comprehensive Income in the period in which 
they occur.
Other movements in the net deficit are recognised in the Income 
Statement, including the current service cost and past service 
cost and the effect of any curtailment or settlements. The 
interest cost less the expected return of assets is also charged to 
the Income Statement within net finance costs.
Share-based payments
The Group makes share-based payments to certain employees 
which are equity and cash-settled. These payments are 
measured at their estimated fair value at the date of grant, 
calculated using an appropriate option pricing model. The fair 
value determined at the grant date is expensed on a straight-
line basis over the vesting period, based on the estimate of the 
number of shares that will eventually vest. At the end of each 
period, the vesting assumptions are revisited and the charge 
associated with the fair value of these options updated. For 
cash-settled share-based payments, a liability equal to the 
portion of the services received is recognised at the current fair 
value as determined at each balance sheet date. On exercise of 
equity settled options, the Group either issues additional shares, 
leading to an increase in share capital and share premium, or 
reduces the amount of own shares held.
Revenue
Revenue represents income from advertising, subscriptions, 
sponsorship and delegate fees, net of value added tax.
• Subscription revenues are recognised in the Income Statement 
on a straight-line basis over the period of the subscription. 
Subscription revenues contain certain items recognised on a 
cash basis including voting revenues where the amount paid 
by the customer is determined by a qualitative vote and paid in 
arrears for services rendered, and best efforts revenues where 
the payments for services rendered are uncertain until received.
• Advertising revenues are recognised in the Income Statement 
on the date of publication, where applicable, or in the case of 
an ad hoc project, when the deliverable has been sent to the 
customer. Advertising revenues represent the fees that customers 
pay to place an advertisement in one or more of the Group’s 
publications, either in print or online, to commission ad hoc 
consulting and thought leadership projects, and to purchase 
survey reports.

1 Accounting policies continued
• Sponsorship and delegate revenues are recognised in the 
Income Statement over the period the event is run.
Revenues invoiced but relating to future periods are deferred 
and treated as deferred income in the Statement of Financial 
Position.
Leased assets
Leases in which a significant portion of the risks and rewards of 
ownership are retained by the lessor are classified as operating 
leases. Operating lease rentals are charged to the Income 
Statement on a straight-line basis as allowed by IAS 17 ‘Leases’.
Dividends
Dividends are recognised as a liability in the period in which 
they are approved by the Company’s shareholders. Interim 
dividends are recorded in the period in which they are paid.
Own shares held by Employees’ Share Ownership Trust 
and Employee Share Trust
Transactions of the group-sponsored trusts are included in the 
Group financial statements. In particular, the trusts’ holdings of 
shares in the Company are debited direct to equity. The Group 
provides finance to the trusts to purchase Company shares to 
meet the obligation to provide shares when employees exercise 
their options or awards. Costs of running the trusts are charged 
to the Income Statement. Shares held by the trusts are deducted 
from other reserves.
Earnings per share
The earnings per share and diluted earnings per share 
calculations follow the provisions of IAS 33 ‘Earnings Per Share’. 
The diluted earnings per share figure is calculated by adjusting 
for the dilution effect of the exercise of all ordinary share 
options, granted by the Company, but excluding the ordinary 
shares held by the Euromoney Employees’ Share Ownership 
Trust and Euromoney Employee Share Trust.
Exceptional items
Exceptional items are items of income or expense considered 
by the Directors, either individually or if of a similar type in 
aggregate, as being significant and which require additional 
disclosure in order to provide an indication of the adjusted 
trading performance of the Group. Such items could include, 
but may not be limited to, costs associated with business 
combinations, gains and losses on the disposal of businesses 
and properties, significant reorganisation or restructuring costs 
and impairment of goodwill and acquired intangible assets. 
Any item classified as an exceptional item will be large and 
unusual, not attributable to underlying operations and will be 
subject to specific quantitative and qualitative thresholds set 
by and approved by the Directors prior to being classified as 
exceptional.
Segment reporting
Operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with 
the internal reporting provided to the Board and CEO who are 
responsible for strategic decisions, allocating resources and 
assessing performance of the operating segments.
2 Key judgemental areas adopted in 
preparing these ﬁnancial statements
In determining and applying accounting policies, judgement is 
often required in respect of items where the choice of specific 
policy, accounting estimate or assumption to be followed could 
materially affect the reported results or net asset position of 
the Group should it later be determined that a different choice 
would have been more appropriate.
Management considers the accounting estimates and 
assumptions discussed below to be its key judgemental areas 
and accordingly provides an explanation of each below. 
Management has discussed its critical accounting estimates 
and judgements and associated disclosures with the Group’s 
Audit Committee. The discussion below should be read in 
conjunction with the Group’s disclosure of accounting policies in 
note 1.
Estimates
Acquisitions
The purchase consideration for the acquisition of a subsidiary 
or business is allocated over the net fair value of identifiable 
assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities acquired with any 
excess consideration representing goodwill. Determining the 
fair value of assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities acquired 
requires significant estimates and assumptions. The Group 
recognises intangible assets acquired as part of a business 
at fair value at the date of acquisition. The determination of 
these fair values is based upon management’s judgement 
and includes assumptions on the timing and amount of future 
cash flows generated by the assets and the selection of an 
appropriate discount rate. Additionally, management must 
estimate the expected useful lives of intangibles assets and 
charge amortisation on the assets accordingly.
Acquisition commitments
The Group is party to put and call options over the remaining 
non-controlling interests in some of its subsidiaries. IAS 32 
‘Financial Instruments: Presentation’ requires the discounted 
present value of these acquisition commitments to be 
recognised as a liability on the Statement of Financial Position 
with a corresponding decrease in reserves. Each period end 
management reassesses the amount expected to be paid and 
any changes to the initial amount are recognised as a finance 
income or expense in the Income Statement. The discounts are 
unwound as a notional interest charge to the Income Statement. 
Key areas of estimation in calculating the discounted present 
value of these commitments are the expected future cash flows 
and earnings of the business, the period remaining until the 
option is exercised and the discount rate. At 30 September 2017, 
the discounted present value of these acquisition commitments 
was £13.1m (2016: £11.8m). A one percentage point increase 
or decrease in growth rate in estimating the expected profits, 
results in the acquisition commitment at 30 September 2017 
increasing or decreasing by £0.2m with the corresponding 
change to the value charged or credited to the Income 
Statement in future periods. The potential undiscounted amount 
of all future payments that the Group could be required to make 
under the acquisition contingent consideration arrangements is 
disclosed in note 25.

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements
Continued
2 Key judgemental areas adopted in 
preparing these ﬁnancial statements 
continued
Goodwill and other intangibles impairment
Goodwill is impaired where the carrying value of goodwill is 
higher than the net present value of future cash flows of those 
cash generating units to which it relates. Key areas of estimation 
in calculating the net present value are the forecast cash flows, 
the long-term growth rate of the applicable businesses and 
the discount rate applied to those cash flows. The sensitivity 
analysis is disclosed in note 12. Goodwill held on the Statement 
of Financial Position at 30 September 2017 was £400.0m (2016: 
£396.1m).
Investments
Investments are impaired where the carrying value of an 
investment is higher than the net present value of the future cash 
flows. Key areas of estimation in calculating the net present 
value are the forecast cash flows, the long-term growth rate 
of the applicable businesses and the discount rate applied to 
those cash flows. Investments held on the Statement of Financial 
Position at 30 September 2017 was £30.4m (2016: £35.9m) of 
which the most significant is Dealogic of £26.2m (2016: £29.0m). 
The investments were tested for impairment and as a result an 
impairment charge of £2.3m was recognised for the Estimize 
available-for-sale investment for the year ended 30 September 
2017 (note 14).
The methodology applied to Dealogic’s value in use calculation 
was based on post-tax cash flows using Dealogic’s board 
approved budget for 2017 to 2021, a post-tax discount rate of 
9% and a long-term nominal growth rate of 2%. Significant 
headroom was identified as a result of this calculation and is not 
sensitive to reasonably possible changes in key assumptions.
Taxation
The Group’s tax expense on profit is the sum of the total 
current and deferred tax expense. The calculation of the total 
tax charge necessarily involves a degree of estimation and 
judgement in respect of certain items whose tax treatment 
cannot be finally determined until resolution has been reached 
with the relevant tax authority or, as appropriate, through a 
formal legal process. The final resolution of some of these 
items may give rise to material profit and loss and/or cash flow 
variances.
The Group is a multinational with tax affairs in many 
geographical locations. This inherently leads to complexity in 
the Group’s tax structure and makes the degree of estimation 
and judgement challenging. The resolution of issues is not 
always within the control of the Group and it is often dependent 
on the efficiency of the legislative processes in the relevant 
taxing jurisdictions in which the Group operates. Issues can, 
and often do, take many years to resolve. Payments in respect 
of tax liabilities for an accounting period include payments on 
account and depend on the final resolution of open items. As 
a result, there can be substantial differences between the tax 
expense in the Income Statement and tax payments.
The Group has significant open items in several tax jurisdictions 
and as a result the amounts recognised in the Group financial 
statements in respect of these items are derived from the 
Group’s best estimation and judgement. However, the inherent 
uncertainty regarding the outcome of these items means 
eventual resolution could differ from the accounting estimates 
and therefore affect the Group’s results and cash flows.
The Group considers each uncertain tax matter on the technical 
merits of the case in law, taking into account all relevant 
evidence, including the known attitude of tax authorities in 
making an assessment of the likelihood a matter will crystallise. 
The uncertain tax provisions are calculated by determining 
the single most likely cash flow for each issue rather than by 
applying a probability threshold and this methodology has been 
applied consistently year-on-year.
Direct tax
There are two main areas of direct tax risk within the Group as 
follows:
• Permanent establishment risk: the Group operates in multiple 
jurisdictions and has internationally mobile employees. There is a 
risk that operating activities could inadvertently create a taxable 
presence in countries where the Group does not have an entity. 
The Group proactively manages this risk and has a transfer 
pricing policy in place for intercompany transactions. It held an 
uncertain tax provision at 30 September 2017 of £1.9m (2016: 
£2.6m) in respect of this risk.
• Challenges by tax authorities: where arrangements that 
have been adopted on the basis of professional advice are 
challenged by tax authorities and there is an expectation 
that there is more likely than not to be a cash outflow, this risk 
is provided for. The Group held a provision in respect of this 
risk at 30 September 2017 of £8.3m (2016: £9.9m). The Group 
had been challenged on: whether certain business disposals 
should give rise to capital gains; a number of internal financing 
arrangements between different jurisdictions that give rise 
to asymmetrical tax outcomes; and whether tax deductions 
taken for costs arising within the Group’s treasury function are 
permissible.
The maximum potential additional exposure for the Group 
in relation to challenges by tax authorities not provided for 
is approximately £28m if all cases were to be settled at the 
maximum potential liability. These additional exposures include 
challenges by: the Canadian Revenue Agency (‘CRA’) on a 
foreign currency trade in 2009, which has a maximum exposure 
of £20m; and the UK’s HMRC on a share-for-share exchange 
related to the Group’s investment in Dealogic, which has a 
maximum exposure of £11m of which £2.8m has been provided. 
On 23 October 2017, the CRA issued a Notice of Reassessment 
to BCA Research Inc (‘BCA’) based on the CRA view that the 
loss sustained by BCA on an intra-group derivative transaction 
cannot be deducted in computing income. Management is 
confident that BCA will be able to overturn these reassessments 
through the normal litigation process, which has already begun. 
Nonetheless, BCA is obligated either to pay one-half of the 
consequential tax owing amounting to £3.5m or to provide 
security for payment satisfactory to the CRA.

2 Key judgemental areas adopted in 
preparing these ﬁnancial statements 
continued
Indirect tax
In 2016, an incremental provision of £7.9m in relation to open 
indirect tax items (including interest) was recognised as an 
exceptional item increasing the Group’s provision for this 
exposure, including interest, to £9.5m. This represented the 
maximum estimated liability in relation to a potential overseas 
sales tax exposure based on an adverse tax ruling. In 2017, 
£3.9m of this provision was released to exceptional items (note 
5) following settlement of £4.0m leaving a provision of £1.6m 
to cover open audit periods. In addition, the Group reviews 
and assesses other indirect tax exposures across the Group 
and a £4.4m provision is the Group’s best estimate of the most 
probable outflow relating to these exposures.
Retirement benefit schemes
The surplus or deficit in the defined benefit pension scheme that 
is recognised through the Statement of Comprehensive Income 
is subject to a number of assumptions and uncertainties. The 
calculated liabilities of the scheme are based on assumptions 
regarding salary increases, inflation rates, discount rates, the 
long-term expected return on the scheme’s assets and member 
longevity. Details of the assumptions and related sensitivities 
used are shown in note 27. Such assumptions are based 
on actuarial advice and are benchmarked against similar 
pension schemes. The discount rate for scheme liabilities and 
the fair value of scheme assets reflects yields at the year-end 
date on high-quality corporate bonds and are based on a 
cash flow-based yield curve, calculating a single equivalent 
discount rate reflecting the average duration of the schemes 
liabilities, rounded to the nearest 0.05% p.a. At 30 September 
2016 this methodology incorporated bonds given an AA rating 
from at least one of the main four rating agencies (Standard 
& Poor’s, Moody’s, Fitch and DBRS). At 30 September 2017 the 
methodology reverted back to incorporated bonds given an 
AA rating from at least two of the four main rating agencies, 
as used in years prior to 30 September 2016. The impact of 
this change in accounting estimate is to increase the defined 
benefit obligation and net pension obligation reported on 
the Statement of Financial Position as at 30 September 2017 
by £1.8m.
Judgements
Discontinued operations and disposal groups classified 
as held for sale
Following the Group’s decision to explore the strategic 
options for the Global Markets Intelligence Division (CEIC and 
EMIS), these businesses have met the recognition criteria of 
a discontinued operation under IFRS 5 ‘Non-current assets 
held for sale and discontinued operations’ and are therefore 
presented as such throughout this report. In order to comply with 
this presentation, the 2016 Income Statement disclosures have 
been re-presented separating continuing and discontinued 
operations (note 11).
Presentation of adjusted performance
The Directors believe that the adjusted profit and earnings 
per share measures provide additional useful information for 
shareholders on evaluating the performance of the business. 
These measures are consistent with how business performance 
is measured internally and are the basis on which executive 
management is incentivised. The adjusted profit before tax 
measure is not a recognised profit measure under IFRS and may 
not be directly comparable with adjusted profit measures used 
by other companies. Adjusted figures are presented before the 
impact of amortisation of acquired intangible assets (comprising 
trademarks and brands, databases and customer relationships), 
exceptional items, share of associates and joint ventures’ 
acquired intangibles amortisation, exceptional items and tax, 
and net movements in deferred consideration and acquisition 
commitments. In respect of earnings, adjusted amounts reflect a 
tax rate that includes the current tax effect of the goodwill and 
intangible assets. Many of the Group’s acquisitions, particularly 
in the US, give rise to significant tax savings as the amortisation 
of goodwill and intangible assets on acquisition is deductible 
for tax purposes. The Group considers that the resulting 
adjusted effective tax rate is therefore more representative of its 
tax payable position. In 2017, the Group has consistently applied 
this definition of adjusted measures as it has reported on its 
financial performance in the past and it is the Group’s intention 
to continue to consistently apply this definition in the future. A 
detailed reconciliation of the Group’s statutory results to the 
adjusted and underlying results is set out on pages 29 to 31.
Centre for Investor Education Limited (CIE)
In April 2013 the Group acquired a 75% equity interest in CIE for 
a final consideration of £10.2m, with a commitment to acquire 
the remaining 25% by early 2016. As part of the local statutory 
audit of CIE for the year to September 30 2014, a number 
of governance and financial irregularities were identified 
which remain subject to legal resolution. As a result of these 
irregularities, the former owner-managers of CIE were replaced 
and a number of adjustments were made to the Group’s 
investment in CIE. In October 2015, the Group filed a public 
statement of claim against the previous owners for breaches 
of warranties and other damages. The Group, in preparation 
of the financial statements at 30 September 2016, examined 
all evidence, including its own management investigation and 
Deloitte & Touche LLP Australia’s findings, and has made the 
judgement that no further amounts are payable under the share 
purchase agreement for CIE. There has been no change to this 
judgement in 2017 and legal proceedings are continuing.

3 Segmental analysis
Segmental information is presented in respect of the Group’s segments and reflects the Group’s management and internal reporting 
structure. The Group is organised into four segments: Asset management; Pricing, data & market intelligence; Banking & finance; 
and Commodity events.
Asset management and pricing, data & market intelligence consist primarily of subscription revenue. Banking & finance consists 
mainly of both sponsorship income and delegates revenue. Commodity events consists primarily of delegates revenue. A 
breakdown of the Group’s revenue by type is set out below.
During the year, the Group sold HedgeFund Intelligence, II Intelligence, Euromoney Indices and LatinFinance (note 15). As a result 
segment information for these businesses has been reclassified as sold businesses and the comparative split of segmental revenues, 
revenue by type, operating profits, acquired intangible amortisation, exceptional items and depreciation and amortisation has 
been restated.
In addition, advertising revenues for 2016 have been restated by £1.3m to include consulting income which was previously reported 
as part of delegates revenue.
The Global Markets Intelligence Division (CEIC and EMIS) has been classified as discontinued operations (note 11) and therefore 
presented as such throughout this report. The 2016 Income Statement disclosures have been re-presented separating continuing 
and discontinued operations. These businesses are reported within the Pricing, data & market intelligence segment.
Analysis of the Group’s three main geographical areas is also set out to provide additional information on the trading performance 
of the businesses.
Inter-segment sales are charged at prevailing market rates and shown in the eliminations columns.

The Group sold HedgeFund Intelligence (loss £4k), II Intelligence (profit £2.2m), Euromoney Indices (loss £1.8m) and LatinFinance 
(profit £3.4m), resulting in a net profit of £3.8m (note 15). The disposal of the joint ventures Institutional Investor Zanbato Limited and

A goodwill impairment charge of £27.4m relates to Ned Davis Research (NDR) (note 12). The impairment of NDR stems from a

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements
Continued
5 Exceptional items continued
An element of the provision for overseas sales tax was released resulting in a credit of £3.9m, following settlement of the sales tax 
exposure (including interest). Given that the provision was classified as exceptional in 2016, the release of the surplus provision has 
been consistently treated as exceptional in 2017.
Restructuring and other exceptional costs consist of professional fees associated with the placement element of the share buyback 
transaction with Daily Mail and General Trust plc (DMGT); professional fees from the legal dispute with the previous owners of 
Centre for Investor Education (CIE); incremental costs relating to the relocation of the New York office; and the acquisition-related 
costs of RISI (note 15). These costs for RISI were treated as exceptional due to the significance of the acquisition. Acquisition costs for 
smaller acquisitions have not been treated as exceptional. No severance costs have been treated as exceptional items in 2017.
The Group’s tax charge includes a related tax credit on the continuing operations exceptional items of £10.1m (note 8).
The discontinued operations have incurred exceptional costs to engage with advisors to assist with the strategic review of the 
Global Markets Intelligence Division. These exceptional costs of £2.4m have been disclosed separately (note 11). The Group’s tax 
charge includes a related tax charge on the discontinued operations exceptional items of £1.1m (note 8).
For the year ended 30 September 2016 the Group recognised a continuing operations exceptional charge of £37.3m.
The Group sold 100% of its equity shareholding of Gulf Publishing and Petroleum Economist which gave rise to a profit on disposal 
of £7.1m. 
A goodwill impairment charge related to Mining Indaba (£12.9m), HFI (£5.9m), and Total Derivatives (£8.2m). An intangibles 
impairment charge of £1.7m related to Euromoney Indices. The Group acquired a further 17% of the equity share capital of World 
Bulk Wine increasing the Group’s equity shareholding to 57%. The transfer from associate to a subsidiary resulted in an impairment 
of associate of £0.1m.
The Group recognised a provision for overseas sales tax of £7.9m following an adverse tax ruling in June 2016.
The Group recognised its share of the deficit in the Harmsworth Pension Scheme (HPS), a defined benefit scheme, of £1.2m.
Restructuring and other exceptional costs mostly comprised costs incurred as a result of the strategic review undertaken during the 
year and professional fees from the CIE legal dispute.
The Group’s tax charge includes a related tax credit on the continuing operations exceptional items of £5.3m (note 8).

The Group presents the above adjusted effective tax rate to help users of this report better understand its tax charge. In arriving 
at this rate, the Group removes the tax effect of adjusting items that reconcile statutory to adjusted profit. A detailed reconciliation 
of the Group’s statutory results to the adjusted and underlying results is set out on pages 29 to 31. However, the current tax effect of 
goodwill and intangible items is not removed. The current tax benefit of tax deductible goodwill and intangible items is recognised 
in the adjusted effective tax rate as the Group considers that this more accurately reflects its expected cash tax payable position 
as the deferred tax effect on the goodwill and intangible items is not expected to crystallise. It would only crystallise in the event of 
a disposal, and that is not expected. Adjustments in respect of prior years are excluded on the basis that the adjusted tax expense 
should reflect the tax rate of the Group for the current year after removing exceptional items. Share of tax on profits of associates 
and joint ventures is calculated on the adjusted profits of associates and joint ventures and excludes tax on exceptional items 
consistent with the Group’s historical approach and policy.

The non-taxable income of £1.6m (2016: £0.4m) arises from the disposal of shares in a subsidiary.
The other items deductible for tax purposes of £5.1m (2016: £5.3m) arise as a result of financing arrangements that result in 
asymmetrical tax treatment in the territories involved, primarily from debt financing provided to US affiliates. These items are 
expected to recur in the short to medium term.
Goodwill and intangibles for the year ended 30 September 2017 are £0.2m. The 2016 goodwill and intangibles of £2.6m arose as a 
result of non-deductible goodwill impairment for HFI and Total Derivatives. There is no impact on 2017 as the goodwill for NDR is 
deductible.
Adjustments in respect of prior years of £2.3m (2016: £1.0m) reflect settlement of open items with tax authorities in 2017 and several 
small items across numerous jurisdictions that relate to changes in estimates.
In addition to the amount charged to the Income Statement, the following amounts relating to tax have been directly recognised in

The adjusted earnings per share figures have been disclosed since the Directors consider it necessary in order to give an indication 
of the adjusted trading performance reflecting the performance both of the Group’s continuing and discontinued operations for the 
year ended 30 September 2017. A detailed reconciliation of the Group’s statutory results to the adjusted and underlying results is set 
out on pages 29 to 31.
11 Discontinued operations and disposal groups classiﬁed as held for sale
Following the strategic review, a number of businesses met the IFRS 5 ‘Non-current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued 
Operations’ criteria to be classified as held for sale at 30 September 2017. These businesses are CEIC and EMIS, Adhesion Group 
S.A. (Adhesion), World Bulk Wine Exhibition, S.L. (World Bulk Wine) and II Journals. The assets and liabilities of these businesses 
have been disclosed separately on the face of the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position. The assets and liabilities held for 
sale are recorded at the lower of their carrying value and fair value less costs to sell. No impairment of these net assets has been 
identified at 30 September 2017.
Following the announcement on 7 September 2017 that the Group was to explore strategic options for its Global Markets 
Intelligence Division (CEIC and EMIS) after unsolicited interest from potential buyers, the Group has engaged with advisors to 
assess its options. CEIC and EMIS meet the IFRS 5 criteria to be treated as discontinued operations due to their size and the fact that 
the businesses constitute a major line of the Group’s business. CEIC and EMIS are therefore presented as discontinued operations 
throughout this report and the 2016 Income Statement disclosures have been re-presented separating continuing and discontinued 
operations. The other businesses classified as held for sale Adhesion, World Bulk Wine and II Journals, do not meet the IFRS 5 
criteria to be treated as discontinued operations.
On 30 October 2017, the Group disposed of Adhesion and its 74% stake in World Bulk Wine to Comexposium Holding SAS for a cash 
consideration of €13.6m (£12.0m). The disposal has been disclosed as an event after the balance sheet date (note 30).

1 The remaining useful economic life.
Intangible assets, other than goodwill, have a finite life and are amortised over their expected useful lives at the rates set out in the 
accounting policies in note 1 of this report.
Goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated, at acquisition, to the cash generating units (CGU) that are expected to 
benefit from that business combination.
During the year the goodwill in respect of each of the businesses was tested for impairment in accordance with IAS 36 ‘Impairment 
of Assets’. The methodology applied to most CGUs’ value in use calculations, reflecting past experience and external sources of 
information, included:
• budgets by business based on pre-tax cash flows with a CAGR of 3% to 17% for the next three years derived from approved 2017 
budgets. Management believes these budgets to be reasonably achievable;
• pre-tax discount rates between 12% and 17%, derived from the Company’s benchmarked weighted average cost of capital (WACC) of 
10% adjusted for risks specific to the nature of CGUs and risks included within the cash flows themselves; and
• long-term nominal growth rate of between 1% and 3%.
Following the impairment review, the impairment losses recognised in exceptional items (note 5) in respect of goodwill and 
intangibles are as follows:

For the year ended 30 September 2017, no impairments were required to the CEIC, EMIS and World Bulk Wine CGUs on a value in 
use basis before being transferred to held for sale. Upon classification as held for sale the CGUs were assessed by reference to 
expected sale proceeds and no impairments were required.
Further disclosures in accordance with IAS 36 are provided where the Group holds an individual goodwill item relating to a CGU 
that is significant, which the Group considers to be 15% or more of the Group’s total carrying value of goodwill. The only significant 
item of goodwill of £172.6m (2016: £177.7m) relates to BCA.

12 Goodwill and other intangibles assets continued
The remaining carrying value of goodwill and acquired intangible assets consists of a number of CGUs, none of which are 
individually significant to the Group. The aggregate value of goodwill for these CGUs is £227.4m (2016: £218.4m).
For BCA, using the above methodology, a pre-tax discount rate of 13.6% (2016: 13.7%) and long-term nominal growth rate of 1.7% 
(2016: 2%), the recoverable amount exceeded the total carrying value by £130.0m (2016: £175.8m). The Directors performed a 
sensitivity analysis on the total carrying value of this CGU. For the recoverable amount to fall to the carrying value, the discount 
rate would need to be increased by seven percentage points (2016: 10 percentage points) or the long-term growth rate reduced by 
10 percentage points (2016: 16 percentage points).
For the other CGUs, IAS 36 provides that, if there is any reasonably possible change to a key assumption that would cause the 
CGU’s carrying amount to exceed its recoverable amount, further disclosures are required. For NDR, when using the above 
methodology and a pre-tax discount rate of 14.2% (2016: 14.4%) and long-term nominal growth rate of 1.7% (2016: 2%), the 
recoverable amount exceeded the total carrying value by £2.0m (2016: £15.7m).
Sensitivity analysis performed around the base case assumptions has indicated that for NDR, the following changes in assumptions 
(in isolation), would cause the value in use to fall below the carrying value:
• the discount rate increased by one percentage point (2016: three percentage points);
• the long-term growth rate reduced by one percentage point (2016: five percentage points).
The headroom has reduced due to the pressure of market conditions resulting in the impairment of NDR’s goodwill in 2017 and 
therefore any significant decrease in the pre-tax cash flows would result in further impairment.
NDR is a global provider of independent research solutions to the world’s leading financial institutions. The impairment of NDR 
stems from a disappointing financial performance of the business in the face of tough market conditions and management changes 
in the first half of 2017.

2 An impairment of £2.3m was recognised for the year ended 30 September 2017.
The Group interests in the above investments remained unchanged since their respective dates of acquisition.
On 26 July 2017, the Group disposed of its 50% investments in II Zanbato Limited and EIIZ Discovery LLC, two joint venture entities, in 
return for the right to purchase up to US$5m of convertible notes in Zanbato at any time up to 26 July 2019. On maturity of the notes, 
Euromoney can either convert to shares in Zanbato at a 20% discount or demand repayment. In addition, the Group entered into a 
US$3.25m (£2.5m) convertible note with Zanbato that has the same conversion features as noted above. The Group has classified 
its US$3.25m (£2.5m) convertible note receivable as a financial asset on the face of the Consolidated Statement of Financial 
Position. The disposal of the joint ventures gave rise to a loss on disposal of £0.9m, after deducting disposal costs, which was 
recognised as an exceptional item (note 5) in the Income Statement.

15 Acquisitions and disposals
Purchase of business
RISI US (Holdco) Inc, (RISI)
On 6 April 2017, the Group acquired 100% of the equity share capital of RISI, the leading price reporting agency for the global 
forest products market, for US$124.5m (£99.7m). The acquisition of RISI is consistent with the Group’s strategy to actively manage 
a portfolio of businesses in asset management, price discovery and other sectors where information, data and convening market 
participants are valued. RISI is included in the pricing, data & market intelligence segment.

Intangible assets represent the brand of US$30.1m (£24.1m), customer relationships of US$50.9m (£40.8m) and technology of 
US$1.8m (£1.4m) for which amortisation of US$2.5m (£1.9m) has been charged for the year. The brand will be amortised over its 
expected useful life of 15 years. The customer relationships will be amortised over their expected useful economic lives of 20 years. 
The technology will be amortised over its expected useful life of four years. The fair value adjustment within trade and other 
payables represents a deferred tax liability of US$33.1m (£26.5m) on the acquired intangible assets.
Goodwill arises from the anticipated profitability and future operating synergies from integrating the acquired operations within 
the Group. All of the goodwill recognised is expected to be deductible for income tax purposes.
The fair value of the assets acquired includes net trade receivables of US$3.8m (£3.0m), all of which are contracted and are 
expected to be collectable.
RISI contributed US$16.3m (£12.6m) to the Group’s revenue, US$3.4m (£2.6m) to the Group’s operating profit and US$2.8m (£2.2m) to 
the Group’s profit after tax for the period between the date of acquisition and 30 September 2017. In addition, acquisition related 
costs of US$2.1m (£1.6m) were incurred and recognised as an exceptional item in the Income Statement for the year ended 30 
September 2017 (note 5). If the acquisition had been completed on the first day of the financial year, RISI would have contributed 
US$32.4m (£25.5m) to the Group’s revenue and US$8.5m (£6.7m) to the Group’s operating profit (excluding exceptional costs above).
Layer123 Events & Training Limited (Layer123)
On 13 April 2017, the Group acquired 61% of the ordinary share capital of Layer123 for a cash consideration of £6.4m and a deferred 
consideration of £0.7m. Layer123 is a content and sponsorship-led events business focusing on innovation in the rapidly-evolving 
space of telecoms network strategy. The acquisition is consistent with the Group’s strategy and expands its presence in the telecoms 
markets. Layer123 is included in the pricing, data & market intelligence segment. At the acquisition date, the non-controlling interest 
of 39% with a value of £1.5m is measured using the proportion of net assets method.
The remaining interest in Layer123 is subject to put and call options under an earn-out agreement, in three equal instalments, 
based on the profits of Layer123 for its years ended February 2018, 2019 and 2020. The total discounted amount that the Group 
expects to pay under this option agreement is £5.0m (note 25).

Intangible assets represent the brand of £2.4m and customer relationships of £1.4m, for which amortisation of £0.3m has been 
charged for the year. The brand will be amortised over its expected useful life of 20 years. The customer relationships will be 
amortised over their expected useful economic lives of five years. The fair value adjustment within trade and other payables 
represents a deferred tax liability of £0.6m on the acquired intangible assets.
Goodwill arises from the anticipated profitability and future operating synergies from integrating the acquired operations within 
the Group. All of the goodwill recognised is expected to be deductible for income tax purposes.
Layer123 contributed £0.9m to the Group’s revenue, £0.2m to the Group’s operating profit and £0.2m to the Group’s profit after tax 
for the period between the date of acquisition and 30 September 2017. If the acquisition had been completed on the first day of the 
financial year, Layer123 would have contributed £2.4m to the Group’s revenue and £1.1m to the Group’s operating profit.

Latin American Financial Publications, Inc. (LatinFinance)
On 31 March 2017, the Group sold 100% of the equity share capital of LatinFinance, which formed part of the banking & finance

The Group has not provided for these trade receivables as there has been no significant change in their credit quality and the 
amounts are still considered recoverable. These relate to a number of independent customers for whom there is no recent history 
of default. The average age of these receivables is 66 days (2016: 73 days). The Group does not hold any collateral over these 
balances.

In determining the recoverability of a trade receivable, the Group considers any change in the credit quality of the trade receivable 
from the date credit was initially granted up to the reporting date. The concentration of credit risk is limited due to the customer 
base being large and unrelated. Accordingly, the Directors believe that there is no further credit risk provision required in excess of 
the allowance for doubtful debts.
The allowance for doubtful debts does not include individually impaired trade receivables which have been placed under 
liquidation as these trade receivables are written off directly to the Income Statement.

Financial risk management objectives
The Group’s activities expose it to a variety of financial risks: market risk (including currency risk, interest rate risk and price risk), 
credit risk and liquidity risk arising in the normal course of business. Derivative financial instruments are used to manage exposures 
to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates but are not employed for speculative purposes.
Full details of the objectives, policies and strategies pursued by the Group in relation to financial risk management are set out in this 
note and on page 95 of the accounting policies. The Group’s Tax and Treasury Committee is responsible for recommending policy 
to the Board. The Group’s treasury policies are directed to giving greater certainty of future costs and revenues and ensuring that 
the Group has adequate liquidity for working capital and debt capacity for funding acquisitions.
The treasury department does not act as a profit centre, nor does it undertake any speculative trading activity and it operates 
within policies and procedures approved by the Board.
Interest rate swaps are used to manage the Group’s exposure to fluctuations in interest rates on its floating rate borrowings. Further 
details are set out in the interest rate risk section (page 123).
Forward contracts are used to manage the Group’s exposure to fluctuations in exchange rate movements on foreign currency 
transactions. Further details are set out in the foreign exchange rate risk section (page 122).
Capital risk management
The Group manages its capital to ensure that entities in the Group will be able to continue as a going concern while maximising the 
return to stakeholders through the optimisation of the debt and equity balance. The Group’s overall strategy remains unchanged 
from 2016.
The capital structure of the Group consists of debt, which includes the borrowings disclosed in note 20, cash and cash equivalents 
and equity attributable to equity holders, comprising share capital, reserves and retained earnings as disclosed in the Statement of 
Changes in Equity.

Net cash/debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio
The Group’s Tax and Treasury Committee reviews the Group’s capital structure at least twice a year. Committed bank facilities 
available to the Group until December 2021 contain covenants based on a maximum 3.0 times net debt to adjusted EBITDA and a 
minimum interest cover ratio of 3.0 times. The amounts and foreign exchange rates used in the covenant calculations are subject to 
adjustments as defined under the terms of the arrangement. Management regularly monitors the covenants and prepares detailed 
cash flow forecasts to ensure that sufficient headroom is available and that the covenants are not close or potentially close to 
breach. Additionally, the Group arranges its currency borrowings in order that they are in proportion to the ratio of earnings in that 
particular currency to total Group earnings.
The bank covenant ratio uses an average exchange rate in the calculation of net debt. The resultant net debt/(cash) to adjusted 
EBITDA ratio is 1.24 times (2016 (0.74) times). Using a closing rate basis for the valuation of net debt/(cash), the ratio was 1.23 times 
(2016 (0.74) times).

Classified as held for sale borrowings and payables (including bank overdrafts) (10,002) (1,000)
(289,490) (121,359)
Derivative instruments are classified as level 2 in the fair value hierarchy and acquisition commitments held at fair value through 
the profit and loss are classified as level 3. Available-for-sale investments are held at cost less any identified impairments as they 
do not have a quoted market price in an active market and the fair value cannot be reliably measured. No other financial assets or 
liabilities are held at fair value. The Directors consider that the carrying value amounts of financial assets and liabilities are equal 
to their fair value.
The Group has derivative assets of £3.3m (2016: £0.4m) and derivative liabilities of £1.2m (2016: £10.4m) with a number of banks that 
do not meet the offsetting criteria of IAS 32, but which the Group has the right to set-off same currency cash flows settled on the 
same date. Consequently, the gross amount of the derivative assets and the gross amount of the derivative liabilities are presented 
separately in the Group’s Statement of Financial Position.
The convertible loan note is a fair value through profit and loss financial asset held at cost as it contains an embedded derivative of 
non-quoted equity for which the Group is unable to accurately determine a fair value.
The acquisition commitments for Reinsurance Security (Consultancy).co.uk Limited is consideration contingent on the future profit 
and revenue of the business and are therefore re-measured at fair value through the profit and loss (note 25).
The Group has entered into an omnibus guarantee and setoff agreement with Lloyds Banking Group plc with a right to setoff 
outstanding credit balances against cash balances. Cash and cash equivalents included gross overdrafts of £0.2m (2016: £nil) 
which are offset under the cash pooling arrangements. This agreement meets the offsetting criteria of IAS 32.
i) Market price risk
Market price risk is the possibility that changes in currency exchange rates, interest rates or commodity prices will adversely affect 
the value of the Group’s financial assets, liabilities or expected future cash flows. The Group’s primary market risks are interest rate 
fluctuations and exchange rate movements. Derivatives are used to hedge or reduce the risks of interest rate and exchange rate 
movements and are not entered into unless such risks exist. Derivatives used by the Group for hedging a particular risk are not 
specialised and are generally available from numerous sources. The fair values of forward exchange contracts are set out in this 
note and represent the value for which an asset could be sold or liability settled between knowledgeable willing parties in an 
arm’s length transaction calculated using the market rates of interest and exchange at 30 September 2017. The Group has no other 
material market price risks. Market risk exposures are measured using sensitivity analysis. There has been no change to the Group’s 
exposure to market risks or the manner in which it manages and measures the risks during the year.

ii) Foreign exchange rate risk
The Group’s principal foreign exchange exposure is to the US dollar. The Group generates approximately two-thirds of its revenues 
in US dollars, including approximately 40% of the revenues in its UK-based businesses, and approximately 80% of its operating 
profits are US dollar-denominated. The Group is therefore exposed to foreign exchange risk on the US dollar revenues in its UK 
businesses, the translation of results of foreign subsidiaries and external loans as well as loans to foreign operations within the 
Group where the denomination of the loan is not in the functional currency of the lender/borrower.
The Group does not hedge the translation of the results of foreign subsidiaries. Fluctuations in the value of sterling versus foreign 
currencies could materially affect the amount of these items in the consolidated financial statements, even if their values have not 
changed in their original currency. The Group does endeavour to match foreign currency borrowings to investments in order to 
provide a natural hedge for the translation of the net assets of overseas subsidiaries.
The carrying amounts of the Group’s US dollar-denominated monetary assets and monetary liabilities at the reporting date are as 
follows:
Assets Liabilities

2016

2016
£000
US dollar 62,742 55,910 (319,446) (347,444)
Subsidiaries normally do not hedge transactions in foreign currencies into the functional currency of their own operations. However, 
at a group level, a series of US dollar and euro forward contracts are put in place to sell forward surplus US dollars and euros 
so as to hedge 80% of the Group’s UK based US dollar and euro revenues for the coming 12 months and 50% of the Group’s UK 
based US dollar and euro revenues for the subsequent six months. The timing and value of these forward contracts is based on 
management’s estimate of its future US dollar and euro revenues over an 18 month period and is regularly reviewed and revised 
with any changes in estimates resulting in either additional forward contracts being taken out or existing contracts’ maturity dates 
being moved forward or back. If management materially underestimate the Group’s future US dollar and euro denominated 
revenues, this would lead to too few forward contracts being in place and the Group being more exposed to swings in US dollar 
and euro to sterling exchange rates. An overestimate of the Group’s US dollar and euro denominated revenues would lead to 
associated costs in unwinding the excess forward contracts. The Group also has a significant operation in Canada whose revenues 
are mainly in US dollars. At a group level a series of forward contracts are put in place up to 18 months forward to hedge the 
operation’s Canadian dollar cost base. In addition, each subsidiary is encouraged to invoice sales in its local functional currency 
where possible. Forward exchange contracts are gross settled at maturity.
Impact of 10% strengthening of sterling against US dollar
The following table details the Group’s sensitivity to a 10% increase and decrease in sterling against US dollar. A 10% sensitivity has 
been determined by the Board as the sensitivity rate appropriate when reporting an estimated foreign currency risk internally and 
represents management’s assessment of a reasonably possible change in foreign exchange rates at the reporting date.
The sensitivity analysis includes only outstanding foreign currency denominated monetary items and adjusts their translation at the 
period end for a 10% change in foreign currency rates. The sensitivity analysis includes external loans as well as loans to foreign 
operations within the Group where the denomination of the loan is not in the functional currency of the lender/borrower. Where 
sterling strengthens 10% against the relevant currency a negative number below indicates a decrease in profit and equity. For a 
10% weakening of sterling against the relevant currency, there would be an equal and opposite impact on the profit and other 
comprehensive income, and the balances below would be positive.

Change in other comprehensive income (derivative financial instruments) 6,545 6,811
Change in other comprehensive income (loans to/from foreign operations) 17,751 29,139
The increase in the loss from the sensitivity analysis is due to an increase in the working capital assets. The decrease in other 
comprehensive income from £6.8m to £6.5m from the sensitivity analysis is due to the decrease in the notional value of the 
derivative financial instruments.
The change in other comprehensive income from a 10% change in sterling against US dollars in relation to the translation of loans 
to/from foreign operations within the Group where the denomination of the loan is not in the functional currency of the lender/
borrower would result in a change of £17.8m (2016: £29.1m). However, the change in other comprehensive income is completely 
offset by the change in value of the foreign operation’s net assets from their translation into sterling.
The Group is also exposed to the translation of the results of its US dollar-denominated businesses, although the Group does not 
hedge the translation of these results. Consequently, fluctuations in the value of sterling versus other currencies could materially 
affect the translation of these results in the consolidated financial statements.

Forward foreign exchange contracts
It is the policy of the Group to enter into forward foreign exchange contracts to cover specific foreign currency payments and 
receipts. A series of US dollar and euro forward contracts are put in place to sell forward surplus US dollars and euros so as to 
hedge 80% of the Group’s UK-based US dollar and euro revenues for the coming 12 months and 50% for the subsequent six months. 
In addition, at a group level a series of US dollar forward contracts is put in place up to 18 months forward to hedge the subsidiary’s 
Canadian cost base. In the past, the Group had also entered into a number of short-dated South African Rand forward contracts to 
hedge future UK-based ZAR payments.

 Rate used for conversion from CAD to GBP is 1.6767 (2016: 1.7072).
As at 30 September 2017, the aggregate amount of unrealised gains under forward foreign exchange contracts deferred in the fair 
value reserve relating to future revenue transactions is £1.8m (2016: £10.0m loss). It is anticipated that the transactions will take place 
over the next 18 months at which stage the amount deferred in equity will be released to the Income Statement. As at 30 September 
2017, there were no ineffective cash flow hedges in place (2016: £nil).
iii) Interest rate risk
The Group’s borrowings are in both sterling and US dollars with the related interest tied to LIBOR. This results in the Group’s interest 
charge being at risk to fluctuations in interest rates. It is the Group’s policy to hedge approximately 80% of its term loan interest 
exposure, converting its floating rate debt into fixed debt by means of interest rate swaps. The predictability of interest costs is 
deemed to be more important than the possible opportunity cost foregone of achieving lower interest rates.
The Group has interest rate swap protection on principal amounts of US$80.0m and £32.0m to swap outstanding borrowings from 
floating to fixed rates at rates of 1.972% and 0.760% respectively until December 2021. As at 30 September 2017, the aggregate 
amount of unrealised gains on interest rate swaps deferred in the fair value reserve relating to future interest cash flows is £0.1m 
(2016: £nil). It is anticipated that the future interest cash flows will take place over the next 4-5 years at which stage the amount 
deferred in equity will be released to the Income Statement. No ineffectiveness was recognised in the Income Statement (2016: £nil).
The Group’s exposures to interest rates on financial assets and financial liabilities are detailed in the liquidity risk section on page 124.

Interest rate sensitivity analysis
The sensitivity analysis has been determined based on the exposure to interest rates for both derivative and non-derivative 
instruments at the balance sheet date. For floating rate instruments, the analysis is prepared assuming the amount outstanding at 
the balance sheet date was outstanding for the whole year. A 100 basis point increase or decrease is used when reporting interest 
rate risk internally to key management personnel and represents the Directors’ assessment of a reasonably possible change in 
interest rates at the reporting date.
If interest rates had been 100 basis points higher or lower and all other variables were held constant, the Group’s profit for the year 
ended 30 September 2017 would decrease or increase by £0.8m (2016: £0.8m). This is mainly attributable to the Group’s exposure 
to interest rates on its variable rate borrowings and cash deposits. Fair value equity reserves would decrease or increase by £3.4m 
mainly as a result of the changes in fair value of interest rate swaps.
iv) Credit risk
Credit risk refers to the risk that a counterparty will default on its contractual obligations resulting in financial loss to the Group. 
The Group seeks to limit interest rate and foreign currency risks described above by the use of financial instruments and as a result 
have a credit risk from the potential non-performance by the counterparties to these financial instruments, which are unsecured. 
The amount of this credit risk is normally restricted to the amounts of any hedge gain and not the principal amount being hedged. 
The Group also has a credit exposure to counterparties for the full principal amount of cash and cash equivalents. Credit risks 
are controlled by monitoring the amounts outstanding with, and the credit quality of, these counterparties. For the Group’s cash 
and cash equivalents these are principally licensed commercial banks and investment banks with strong long-term credit ratings. 
Treasury policies in place do not allow concentrations of risk with individual counterparties and do not allow significant treasury 
exposures with counterparties which are rated below investment grade.
The Group also has credit risk with respect to trade and other receivables, prepayments and accrued income. The concentration 
of credit risk from trade receivables is limited due to the Group’s large and broad customer base. Trade receivable exposures are 
managed locally in the business units where they arise. Allowance is made for bad and doubtful debts based on management’s 
assessment of the risk of non-payment taking into account the ageing profile, experience and circumstance.
The maximum exposure to credit risk is represented by the carrying amount of each financial asset, including derivative financial 
instruments, recorded in the Statement of Financial Position. The Group does not have any significant credit risk exposure to any 
single counterparty or any group of counterparties having similar characteristics. The Group defines counterparties as having 
similar characteristics if they are related entities. Concentration of credit risk did not exceed 5% of gross monetary assets at any time 
during the year.
v) Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will not be able to meet its financial obligations as and when they fall due. To manage this 
risk the Group has readily accessible funding arrangements in place and seeks to optimise Group liquidity through cash pooling 
arrangements.
The Group’s principal source of borrowings are provided through committed bank facilities available to the Group until December 
2021. These syndicated facilities include a £130m multi-currency revolving credit facility which was drawn down by £55.2m at 
30 September 2017.
In 2016, the Group had access to a committed multi-currency credit facility from DMGT. This facility was terminated in December 
2016 as part of the share buyback transaction along with a deposit agreement for placing excess operating funds on deposit with 
DMGT.
The Group’s strategy is to use excess operating cash to pay down its drawings under the revolving credit facility. The Group 
generally has an annual cash conversion rate (the percentage by which cash generated from operations covers adjusted operating 
profit before acquired intangible amortisation and exceptional items) of 100% or more due to much of its subscription, sponsorship 
and delegate revenue being paid in advance. The Group’s operating cash conversion rate based on adjusted operating profit was 
110%.
The Group’s forecasts and projections, looking out to September 2022 and taking account of reasonably possible changes in 
trading performance, show that the Group should be able to operate within the level and covenants of its current and available 
borrowing facilities.

This table has been drawn up based on the undiscounted contractual cash flows of the financial liabilities including both interest 
and principal cash flows. To the extent that the interest rates are floating, the undiscounted amount is derived from interest rate

19 Financial instruments and risk management continued
The following table details the Group’s liquidity analysis for its derivative financial instruments. The table has been drawn up based 
on the undiscounted net cash inflows and outflows on those derivatives that settle on a net basis and the undiscounted gross 
inflows and outflows on those derivatives that require gross settlement. When the amount payable or receivable is not fixed, the 
amount disclosed has been determined by reference to the projected interest rates as represented by the yield curves existing at 
the reporting date.

Fair value of financial instruments
The fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities are determined in accordance with IFRS 13 ‘Fair Value Measurement’ as 
follows:
Level 1
• The fair value of financial assets and financial liabilities with standard terms and conditions and traded on active liquid markets is 
determined with reference to quoted market prices.
Level 2
• The fair value of other financial assets and financial liabilities (excluding derivative instruments) is determined in accordance with 
generally accepted pricing models based on discounted cash flow analysis using prices from observable current market transactions 
and dealer quotes for similar instruments.
• Foreign currency forward contracts are measured using quoted forward exchange rates and yield curves derived from quoted interest 
rates matching maturities of the contracts.
• Interest rate swaps are measured at the present value of future cash flows estimated and discounted based on the applicable yield 
curve derived from quoted interest rates.
Level 3
• If one or more significant inputs are not based on observable market date, the instrument is included in level 3.
As at 30 September 2017 and the prior year, all the resulting fair value estimates have been included in level 2 other than the 
Group’s contingent considerations which are classified as level 3.
Other financial instruments not recorded at fair value
The Directors consider that the carrying amounts of financial assets and financial liabilities recorded at amortised cost in the 
financial statements approximate their fair values. Such financial assets and financial liabilities include cash and cash equivalents, 
receivables, payables and loans.

20 Loans continued
Committed borrowing facilities
The Group’s principal source of borrowings is provided through committed bank facilities available until December 2021. These 
syndicated facilities include two five-year term-loans of US$100m and £40m (total £114.6m) and a £130m multi-currency revolving 
credit facility which was drawn down by £55.2m at 30 September 2017. There is a further accordion facility of £130m should the 
Group wish to request it. The term-loans and drawings under the revolving credit facility bear interest charged at LIBOR plus a 
margin, the applicable margin being based on the Group’s ratio of adjusted net debt to EBITDA. These facilities contain covenants 
based on a maximum 3.0 times adjusted net debt to EBITDA and a minimum interest cover ratio of 3.0 times. The amounts 
and foreign exchange rates used in the covenant calculations are subject to adjustments as defined under the terms of the 
arrangement. On this basis, at 30 September 2017, the Group’s adjusted net debt to EBITDA was 1.24 times. Management regularly 
monitors the covenants and prepares detailed cash flow forecasts to ensure that sufficient headroom is available and that the 
covenants are not close or potentially close to breach.
In 2016, the Group had access to a committed multi-currency credit facility from DMGT. This facility was terminated in December 
2016 as part of the share buyback transaction.
The Group’s strategy is to use excess operating cash to pay down its drawings under the revolving credit facility. The Group 
generally has an annual cash conversion rate (the percentage by which cash generated from operations covers adjusted operating 
profit before acquired intangible amortisation and exceptional items) of 100% or more due to much of its subscription, sponsorship 
and delegate revenue being paid in advance. The Group’s operating cash conversion rate based on adjusted operating profit was 
110%.

Onerous lease provision
The onerous lease provision relates to certain buildings within the property portfolio which either at acquisition were rented at non-
market rates, or are no longer occupied by the Group.
Other provisions
The provision consists of social security costs arising on share option liabilities and dilapidations on leasehold properties. A 
dilapidation provision of £2.1m (2016: £2.1m) is held in respect of the Group’s main London offices. The leases, which expire in 2029, 
do not contain any break clauses. As such, it is unlikely that the provisions will be utilised before the expiry date of the leases.

Deferred tax liability (41,629) 2,248 5,515 (11) – 1,199 9,247 (23,431)
There is a deferred tax asset held in relation to UK losses of £1.5m (2016: £1.4m) that is expected to reverse in the short-term. There is 
a deferred tax liability in relation to remitted earnings of £1.1m (2016: £nil) that is expected to reverse in the short-term.
At the balance sheet date the Group has unused US tax losses available for offset against future profits. At 30 September the 
deferred tax asset recognised in relation to these losses is analysed as follows:
2017
£000
2016
£000
UK 1,899 3,248
US 2,248 2,056
Europe 1,489 –
5,636 5,304
The Directors are of the opinion that based on recent and forecast trading it is probable that the level of profits in future years is 
sufficient to enable the above assets to be recovered. The US losses can be carried forward for a period of 20 years from the date 
they arose and have expiry dates between 2017 and 2037. There is no expiry date on the other losses.
The movement in net deferred tax liabilities since last year-end is largely attributable to the acquisition of RISI (note 15) partly offset 
by the impact of the NDR goodwill impairment (note 5).
No deferred tax liability is recognised on temporary differences of £300.0m (2016: £266.0m) relating to the unremitted earnings of 
overseas subsidiaries as the Group is able to control the timing of the reversal of these temporary differences and it is probable that 
they will not reverse in the foreseeable future. The temporary differences at 30 September 2017 represent the unremitted earnings 
of those overseas subsidiaries where remittance to the UK of those earnings may still result in a tax liability, principally as a result of 
dividend withholding taxes levied by the overseas tax jurisdictions in which these subsidiaries operate.

Cash-settled options
The Group has liabilities in respect of two share option schemes that are classified by IFRS 2 ‘Share-based Payments’ as cash-
settled. These consist of the cash element of the CAP 2010 and the CAP 2014 scheme.
Share Option Schemes
The Company has four share option schemes for which an IFRS 2 ‘Share-based Payments’ charge has been recognised. Details 
of these schemes are set out in the Directors’ Remuneration Report on pages 58 to 73. The fair value per option granted and the

The Group operates a SAYE scheme in which all employees, including Directors, employed in the UK are eligible to participate. 
Participants save a fixed monthly amount of up to £500 for three years and are then able to buy shares in the Company at a price 
set at a 20% discount to the market value at the start of the savings period. In line with market practice, no performance conditions 
attach to options granted under this plan.
The SAYE options were valued using the Black–Scholes option-pricing model. Expected volatility was determined by calculating the 
historical volatility of the Group’s share price over a period of three years. The expected term of the option used in the model has 
been adjusted, based on management’s best estimate, for the effects of non-transferability, exercise restrictions and behavioural 
considerations.

The CAP 2010 executive share option scheme was approved by shareholders on 21 January 2010. Each CAP 2010 award comprises 
two equal elements: an option to subscribe for ordinary shares of 0.25 pence each in the Company at an exercise price of 
0.25 pence per ordinary share, and a right to receive a cash payment. The award pool comprised 3,500,992 ordinary shares with 
an option value of £15.0m and cash of £15.0m, limiting the total accounting cost to £30.0m over its life. The awards vest in two equal 
tranches. The first tranche of awards became exercisable in February 2013 on satisfaction of the primary performance condition 
in 2012 and there are no options outstanding. The second tranche became exercisable in February 2014 in which the primary 
performance condition was again satisfied. The remaining balance of the second tranche is subject to an additional performance 
condition, applicable for the vesting of the second tranche of awards, which requires the profits of each business in the subsequent 
vesting period be at least 75% of that achieved in the year the first tranche of awards became exercisable. The options lapse to the 
extent unexercised by 30 September 2020.
The remaining CAP 2010 share options are unlikely to vest and the charge has been released in 2017.
The CAP 2014 was approved by shareholders on 30 January 2014 as a replacement for CAP 2010. Each CAP 2014 award comprises 
two equal instalments: an option to subscribe for ordinary shares of 0.25 pence each in the Company for nil consideration, and a 
right to receive a cash payment. The value of the awards is linked directly to the growth in profits over the performance period. The 
award pool comprises a maximum of 3.5m shares and cash of £7.6m, limiting the cost of the scheme to £41.0m over its life. Awards 
will vest in three equal tranches, subject to the performance conditions, and lapse to the extent unexercised by 30 September 2023.
The minimum performance target under CAP 2014 was not achieved and the options have lapsed in 2017. No costs were amortised 
in 2017 (2016: £nil).
Performance Share Plan (PSP)
The PSP was approved by shareholders on 1 June 2015. Under the PSP, each award of nil-cost options has a maximum life of 
10 years. The maximum award is shares with a market value of 200% of annualised basic salary. These awards will not normally 
vest until the respective three or five years after the award and provided the performance conditions have been met.
For the year ended 30 September 2017, two grants which have either a three or five-year vesting periods were made under the PSP 
in the form of nil-cost options. A share award was made to A Rashbass of 141,857 and CR Jones of 25,562. The actual number of 
award shares which vest will depend on the extent to which performance conditions have been satisfied over a five-year period 
ending on 30 September 2021. The other share award was made to Divisional Directors totalling 157,809 award shares whereby 
vesting will depend on the extent to which performance conditions have been satisfied over a three-year period ending on 
30 September 2019.
For the year ended 30 September 2016, the only grant under this scheme was to A Rashbass for 159,269 share awards with a fair 
value of £1.5m.
The share price used to determine the number of shares awarded under the PSP grants is the average of the middle market 
quotations of an Ordinary Share as derived from the Daily Official List for the five dealing days preceding the date of grant. Further 
details are shown in the Directors’ Remuneration Report.

25 Acquisition commitments and deferred consideration
The Group is party to contingent consideration arrangements in the form of acquisition commitments, acquisition deferred 
consideration payments and deferred consideration receipts on disposal. The Group recognises the discounted present value of 
the contingent consideration. This discount is unwound as a notional interest charge to the Income Statement. The Group regularly 
performs a review of the underlying businesses to assess the impact on the fair value of the contingent consideration. Any resultant 
change in these fair values is reported as a finance income or expense in the Income Statement.

The non-controlling interest of Ned Davis Research (NDR) has exercised its put options over the remaining 15% stake in NDR. The 
liability has been re-measured using the contractual mechanism which has resulted in a credit to the Income Statement of £3.3m. 
The discounted present value of the acquisition commitment relating to NDR at 30 September 2017 was £8.5m and will be settled in 
January 2018.
The value of the acquisition commitments, acquisition deferred consideration payments and deferred consideration receipts on 
disposal is subject to a number of assumptions. The potential undiscounted amount of all future payments that the Group could be

On 30 October 2017, the Group disposed of its 74% stake in World Bulk Wine to Comexposium Holding SAS for a cash consideration 
of €13.6m (£12.0m) (note 11). The discounted present value of the acquisition commitment relating to World Bulk Wine at 
30 September 2017 was £0.3m. The disposal has been disclosed as an event after the balance sheet date (note 30).

The discounted acquisition commitments, acquisition deferred consideration payments and deferred consideration receipts on 
disposal are based on pre-determined multiples of future profits of the businesses and have been estimated on a transaction by 
transaction basis using available performance forecasts. The Directors derive their estimates from internal business plans and 
financial due diligence. At 30 September 2017, the weighted average growth rates used in estimating the expected profits range 
was 5%.
A one percentage point increase or decrease in growth rate in estimating the expected profits results in the acquisition commitment 
at 30 September 2017 increasing or decreasing by £0.2m with the corresponding change to the value charged or credited to the 
Income Statement in future periods.

The Group’s operating leases do not include any significant leasing terms or conditions. In December 2016, Institutional Investor LLC 
entered into a lease agreement for offices in New York. This lease expires in April 2033 and does not include a break clause. The 
lease was rent free during the year to 30 September 2017. The future operating lease commitments are £47.2m.

27 Retirement beneﬁt schemes
The Group operates a number of pension schemes under which contributions are paid by the employer and employees. The total 
net pension costs from continuing operations of the Group for the year ended 30 September 2017 were £3.1m (2016: £3.1m).
Defined contribution schemes
The Group operates the following defined contribution schemes: DMGT PensionSaver, Euromoney PensionSaver and the Metal 
Bulletin Group Personal Pension Plan in the UK and 401(k) savings and investment plan in the US.
In compliance with the Pension Act 2008, the Group operated a defined contribution plan, DMGT PensionSaver, up to 30 June 2017 
and thereafter the Euromoney PensionSaver, into which relevant employees are automatically enrolled.
The pension charge in respect of defined contribution schemes for the year ended 30 September comprised:

DMGT and Euromoney PensionSaver
Both schemes operate as group personal pension plan under the same terms. The Euromoney PensionSaver is the principal 
pension arrangement offered to employees of the Group. Employees are able to contribute a minimum of 2% of salary with an 
equal company contribution in the first three years of employment and thereafter at twice the employee contribution rate, up to a 
maximum employer contribution of 10% of salary. Assets are invested in funds selected by members and held independently from 
the Company’s finances. The investment and administration is undertaken by Fidelity Pension Management.
Metal Bulletin Group Personal Pension Plan
The Metal Bulletin Group Personal Pension Plan is a defined contribution arrangement under which contributions are paid by the 
employer and employees. The scheme is closed to new members. The plan’s assets are invested under trust in funds selected by 
members and held independently from the Company’s finances. The investment and administration of the plan is undertaken by 
Skandia Life Group.
Private schemes
Institutional Investor LLC contributes to a 401(k) savings and investment plan for its employees which is administered by an 
independent investment provider. Employees are able to contribute up to 50% of salary (maximum of US$52,000 a year) with the 
Company matching up to 50% of the employee contributions, up to 6% of salary.
Defined benefit schemes
The Group operates the Metal Bulletin plc Pension Scheme (MBPS) and participates in the Harmsworth Pension Scheme (HPS), 
which is a scheme operated by DMGT, both of which are now closed to new entrants. In 2016, due to a change in DMGT’s policy to 
allocate the assets and liabilities of DMGT group’s defined benefit plan on a buy-out basis, the Group’s share of HPS’s liability was 
recognised at 30 September 2016, which was treated as an exceptional item as shown in note 5.
Harmsworth Pension Scheme
HPS is a multi-employer defined benefit scheme operated by DMGT and closed to further accrual.
A full actuarial valuation of the scheme is carried out triennially by the scheme actuary. Prior to its closure to future accrual on 
1 January 2016, DMGT made annual contributions of 12% or 18% of members basic pay (depending on membership section) to HPS. 
Following the results of the latest triennial valuation as at 31 March 2016, DMGT agreed a Recovery Plan involving annual funding 
payments of £13.0m on 5 October 2016 to 2018, £16.2m on 5 October 2019 to 2025 and £76.2m on 5 October 2026. DMGT considers 
that these contribution rates are sufficient to eliminate the deficit over the agreed period. This Recovery Plan will be reviewed at the 
next triennial valuation due to be completed with an effective date of 31 March 2019.
In February 2014 DMGT agreed with the Trustees, that should it continue its share buy-back programme, it would make additional 
contributions to its schemes amounting to 20% of the value of shares purchased. No contributions relating to this agreement were 
made in the year to 30 September 2017.
DMGT enabled the Trustees of HPS scheme to acquire a beneficial interest in a Limited Partnership investment vehicle (LP). The 
LP has been designed to facilitate payment of £10.8m as part of the deficit funding payments described above over the period to 
2026. In addition, the LP is required to make a final payment to the scheme of £149.9m, or the funding deficit within the scheme on 
an ongoing actuarial valuation basis at the end of the period to 2026 if this is less. For funding purposes, HPS’s interest in the LP is 
treated as an asset of the scheme and reduces the actuarial deficit within the scheme. However, under IAS 19 ‘Employee Benefits’ 
the LP is not included as an asset of the scheme and therefore is not included in the disclosures below.
DMGT also has a defined benefit obligation relating to the DMGT AVC Plan (the Plan) which is closed to further member 
contributions. Following the results of the most recent actuarial valuation of the Plan, carried out with an effective date of 31 March 
2017, the Trustees and DMGT have agreed that no further contributions are required from DMGT.

27 Retirement beneﬁt schemes continued
DMGT expects to contribute approximately £13.0m to the schemes during the year to 30 September 2017 including the deficit 
funding payments described above. The Euromoney Group did not contribute to the scheme in 2017 and expects to contribute £0.1m 
in 2018.
Northcliffe Trustees Limited (the Trustee) has been appointed by DMGT as an independent trustee to administer and manage the 
HPS on behalf of the members in accordance with the terms of the HPS Trust Deed and Rules and relevant legislation (principally 
the Pension Schemes Act 1993, the Pensions Act 1995 and the Pensions Act 2004).
Metal Bulletin Pension Scheme
A full actuarial valuation of the defined benefit scheme is carried out triennially by the Scheme Actuary. The latest valuation of 
the MBPS was completed as at 1 June 2016. As a result of the 2016 valuation, the Company agreed to make annual contributions of 
38.9% per annum of pensionable salaries, plus £55,900 per month to the scheme over the period to 2022. The Group considers that 
the contributions set at the last valuation date are sufficient to eliminate the deficit and that regular contributions, which are based 
on service costs, will not increase significantly.
The Group expects to contribute approximately £0.7m to the MBPS during the year to 30 September 2018.
Pension Legacy Trustees Limited (the Trustee) has been appointed by Euromoney Global Limited as an independent trustee to 
administer and manage the MBPS on behalf of the members in accordance with the terms of the MBPS Trust Deed and Rules and 
relevant legislation (principally the Pension Schemes Act 1993, the Pensions Act 1995 and the Pensions Act 2004).
The International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee, in its document IFRIC 14, has interpreted the extent to which a 
company can recognise a pension surplus on its Statement of Financial Position. Having taken account of the rules of the schemes, 
the Group considers that recognition of surpluses in the schemes on its Statement of Financial Position would be in accordance with 
the interpretation of IFRIC 14.
A reconciliation of the net pension deficit reported in the Statement of Financial Position is shown in the following table:

nor any property occupied by, or other assets used by, the Group. The actual return on plan assets was £4.0m (2016: £4.8m).
The key financial assumptions adopted are as follows:
MBPS HPS
2017
%
2016
%
2017
%
2016

Discount rate 2.55 2.40 2.60 2.40

Salary increases 2.50 2.50 2.50 2.50
Pension increases 3.00 2.80 3.00 2.80
The discount rate for both scheme liabilities and the fair value of scheme assets reflects yields at the year-end date on high-quality 
corporate bonds and are based on a cash flow-based yield curve, calculating a single equivalent discount rate reflecting the 
average duration of the schemes liabilities, rounded to the nearest 0.05% p.a. At 30 September 2016 this methodology incorporated 
bonds given an AA rating from at least one of the main four rating agencies (Standard & Poor’s, Moody’s, Fitch and DBRS). At 
30 September 2017 the methodology reverted back to incorporated bonds given an AA rating from at least two of the four main 
rating agencies, as used in years prior to 30 September 2016. The impact of this change in accounting estimate is to increase the 
defined benefit obligation and net pension obligation reported on the Statement of Financial Position as at 30 September 2017 
by £1.8m.
RPI inflation is derived in a similar way to the discount rate but with reference to the Bank of England spot curve at the duration of 
the schemes weighted average duration with an appropriate allowance for inflation risk premium (MBPS: 0.30% p.a., HPS: 0.20% 
p.a.). The nominal and real spot curves provided by the Bank of England were extrapolated up to 50 years using a bootstrapping 
method which uses gilt price information provided by the UK Debt Management Office.
Mortality assumptions take account of scheme experience, and also allow for further improvements in life expectancy based on the 
Continuous Mortality Investigation (CMI) projections but with a long-term rate of improvement in future mortality rates of 1.25% p.a. 
Allowance is made for the extent to which employees have chosen to commute part of their pension for cash at retirement.

The average duration of the defined benefit obligation at the end of the year is approximately 16 years for MBPS (2016: 20 years) 
and 20 years for HPS (2016: 20 years).

Females 31.0 28.7 29.2 28.7

Pension costs and the size of any pension surplus or deficit are sensitive to the assumptions adopted. The sensitivity of the defined 
obligation to changes in the weighted principal assumptions is:
Assumption
Change in
assumption
Change in
liabilities
Discount rate Increase by 0.1% Decrease by 0.9%
Inflation rate Increase by 0.1% Increase by 0.8%
Salary increases Increase by 0.25% Increase by 0.7%
Life expectancy Increase by one year Increase by 3.4%
The above sensitivity analyses are based on a change in an assumption while holding all other assumptions constant. In practice 
this is unlikely to occur, and changes in some of the assumptions may be correlated. The sensitivity of the defined benefit obligation 
to significant actuarial assumptions has been estimated by projecting the results of the last full actuarial valuation as at 1 June 2016 
forward to 30 September 2019.
The methods and types of assumptions used in preparing the sensitivity analysis did not change compared to the previous period.
These are the significant risks in connection with running defined benefit schemes, and the key risks are detailed below:
Discount rate risk
The present value of the defined benefit obligation is calculated using a discount rate set with reference to high-quality corporate 
bond yields. A decrease in corporate bond yields will increase the present value of the defined benefit obligation, although this will 
be partially offset by an increase in the value of corporate bonds held by the schemes.
Inflation rate risk
A significant proportion of the defined benefit obligation is linked to inflation, therefore increased inflation will result in a higher 
defined benefit obligation. The Trustees have sought to acquire certain assets with exposure to inflationary uplifts in order to 
negate a proportion of this risk.
Life expectancy risk
The present value of the defined benefit obligation is calculated with reference to the best estimate of the mortality of scheme 
members. An increase in assumed life expectancy will result in an increase in the defined benefit obligation. Regular reviews of 
mortality experience are performed to ensure life expectancy assumptions remain appropriate.
Investment risk
This is a measure of the uncertainty that the return on the schemes’ assets keeps pace with the discount rate. The schemes hold a 
significant proportion of equities and similar ‘growth assets’, which are expected to outperform the discount rate in the long term.
28 Contingent liabilities
Claims in Malaysia
Four writs claiming damages for libel were issued in Malaysia against the Company and three of its employees in respect of an 
article published in one of the Company’s magazines, International Commercial Litigation, in November 1995. The writs were 
served on the Company on 22 October 1996. Two of these writs have been discontinued. The total outstanding amount claimed 
on the two remaining writs is Malaysian ringgit 83.1m (£14.7m). No provision has been made for these claims in these financial 
statements as the Directors do not believe the Company has any material liability in respect of these writs.

Notes to the Company Accounts
1 Accounting policies
Basis of preparation
These financial statements have been prepared in compliance 
with United Kingdom Accounting Standards, including Financial 
Reporting Standard 102, The Financial Reporting Standard 
Applicable in the UK and Republic of Ireland (FRS 102), and the 
Companies Act 2006. The accounts have been prepared under 
the historical cost convention except for financial instruments 
which have been measured at fair value and in accordance 
with applicable United Kingdom accounting standards and 
the United Kingdom Companies Act 2006. The accounting 
policies set out below have, unless otherwise stated, been 
applied consistently throughout the current and prior year. 
The going concern basis has been applied in these accounts. 
No operating segments have been disclosed as the Company 
operates as one operating segment.
Disclosure exemptions
The Company satisfies the criteria of being a qualifying entity 
as defined in FRS 102. Its financial statements are consolidated 
into the financial statements of the Group. As such, advantage 
has been taken of the following disclosure exemptions available 
under FRS 102 in relation to share-based payments, financial 
instruments, presentation of a cash flow statement, certain 
related party transactions and the effect of future accounting 
standards not yet adopted.
Leased assets
Operating lease rentals are charged to the profit and loss 
account on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.
Tangible fixed assets
Tangible fixed assets are stated at cost less accumulated 
depreciation and any recognised impairment loss. Depreciation 
of tangible fixed assets is provided on a straight-line basis over 
their expected useful lives at the following rates per year:
Short-term leasehold premises: over term of lease
Taxation
Current tax, including UK corporation tax and foreign tax, is 
provided at amounts expected to be paid (or recovered) using 
the tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively 
enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax arises from timing differences that are differences 
between taxable profits and total comprehensive income as 
stated in the financial statements. These timing differences arise 
from the inclusion of income and expenses in tax assessments 
in periods different from those in which they are recognised in 
financial statements. Deferred tax is recognised on all timing 
differences at the reporting date except for certain exceptions. 
Unrelieved tax losses and other deferred tax assets are only 
recognised when it is probable that they will be recovered 
against the reversal of deferred tax liabilities or other future 
taxable profits. Deferred tax is measured using tax rates and 
laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the 
period end and that are expected to apply to the reversal of the 
timing difference.
Subsidiaries
Investments in subsidiaries are accounted for at cost less 
impairment. Cost is adjusted to reflect amendments from 
contingent consideration. Cost also includes directly 
attributable cost of investment.
Interest in associates
Investments in associates are held at historical cost less 
accumulated impairment losses.
Trade and other debtors
Trade receivables are recognised and carried at original 
invoice amount, less provision for impairment. A provision is 
made and charged to the profit and loss account when there is 
objective evidence that the Company will not be able to collect 
all amounts due according to the original terms.
Cash at bank and in hand
Cash at bank and in hand includes cash, short-term deposits 
and other short-term highly liquid investments with an original 
maturity of three months or less.
Dividends
Dividends are recognised as an expense in the period in which 
they are approved by the Company’s shareholders. Interim 
dividends are recorded in the period in which they are paid.
Provisions
A provision is recognised in the balance sheet when the 
Company has a present legal or constructive obligation as a 
result of a past event, and it is probable that economic benefits 
will be required to settle the obligation. If material, provisions 
are determined by discounting the expected future cash flows 
at a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the 
time value of money and, where appropriate, the risks specific 
to the liability.
Share-based payments
The Company makes share-based payments to certain 
employees which are equity-settled. These payments are 
measured at their estimated fair value at the date of grant, 
calculated using an appropriate option pricing model. The fair 
value determined at the grant date is expensed on a straight-
line basis over the vesting period, based on the estimate of the 
number of shares that will eventually vest. At the period end the 
vesting assumptions are revisited and the charge associated 
with the fair value of these options updated. In accordance 
with the transitional provisions, FRS 102 section 26 ‘Share-
based Payments’ has been applied to all grants of options 
after 7 November 2002 that were unvested at 1 October 2004, 
the date of application of FRS 20. The Company operates the 
Group’s PSP and other Group share-based payment schemes, 
details of which can be found in note 24 to the Group accounts.
Own shares held by Employees’ Share Ownership Trust 
and Employees Share Trust
Transactions of the group-sponsored trusts are included in the 
Group financial statements. In particular, the trusts’ holdings of 
shares in the Company are debited direct to equity. The Group 
provides finance to the trusts to purchase Company shares to 
meet the obligation to provide shares when employees exercise 
their options or awards. Costs of running the trusts are charged 
to the Income Statement. Shares held by the trusts are deducted 
from other reserves.
2 Key judgemental areas adopted in 
preparing these ﬁnancial statements
Investments
Investments are impaired where the carrying value of an 
investment is higher than the net present value of the future 
cash flows. An impairment of £113.2m was recognised in 2016 
(note 6). Key areas of judgement in calculating the net present 
value are the forecast cash flows, the long-term growth rate 
of the applicable businesses and the discount rate applied to 
those cash flows. Investments held in the Statement of Financial 
Position at 30 September 2017 were £1,087m (2016: £1,215m).

On 9 December 2016 the Company sold its shareholding in CEIC Holdings Ltd and Diamond Topco Limited to Euromoney 
Publications (Jersey) Ltd, a subsidiary of the Company, for a consideration of US$159m.
For the financial year ended 2016, the Company subscribed to 1,000 new ordinary shares of HK$1 each in CEIC Holdings Ltd for 
a total consideration of US$148m and subscribed to 43 new ordinary shares of £1 each in Euromoney Canada Ltd for a total 
consideration of £235m. In addition, a review of the Company’s investments was undertaken to ensure that their carrying book 
values were supported by their expected future profits. It was found that the carrying value of the investment in Euromoney Jersey 
Limited could no longer be supported. As a result, an impairment was made to fully write down the value of the investment, 
resulting in a charge of £113.2m.
Details of the principal subsidiary and associated undertakings of the Company at 30 September 2017 can be found in note 31 to 
the Group accounts.
