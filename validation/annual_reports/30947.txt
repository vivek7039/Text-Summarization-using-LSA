During 2017, we made significant progress with another year 
of record production from our core producing mines. We 
are aiming to continue to drive low cost growth from the 
business over the next few years through a combination 
of new discoveries, optimising our current portfolio and 
potential increased throughput from our plants.
Exciting discovery  
opportunities
We have a pipeline of brownfield 
and greenfield projects in numerous 
locations across three countries in the 
Americas, as well as substantial parcels  
of premium geological land. 
 See page 08
A world-class  
asset portfolio
In 2017, our four current operating mines 
produced 19.1 million attributable ounces 
of silver and 254,930 ounces of gold 
which resulted in another overall record 
of 38 million silver equivalent ounces.

03 Inmaculada – 
expansion potential  
at our flagship mine
We believe that there is strong 
upside resource potential at the 
Inmaculada deposit with drilling 
results from our first campaign in 
six years confirming the geological 
hypothesis. We intend to continue 
to explore the area, add further 
resources and then we will be in 
position to make a decision on 
whether to expand our modular 
processing plant or to add to 
Inmaculada’s life-of-mine.
Pallancata –  
realising significant 
potential
Since its discovery in 2015, the 
Pablo area including the main 
Pablo vein and ancillary veins has 
hugely expanded its contained 
tonnage and grade. In 2017 , the 
Company received the Peruvian 
government approval to begin 
mining the Pablo vein, increasing 
the throughput up to 2,800 tonnes 
per day during 2018 and delivering 
competitive costs.

attributable ounces of silver and just over 
254,000 ounces of gold. This marked the 
fifth consecutive year of output increases.

Debt reduction 
programme on track
Since the completion of the 
construction of the Inmaculada 
mine in 2015, we have been aiming 
to reduce the Company’s debt 
position. In 2017, we made further 
encouraging progress with net debt 
almost halved versus the end of 
2016 and a refinancing programme 
towards the end of the year that is 
expected to result in significant 
reductions in the Company’s 
ongoing interest payments. 
Consistently meeting 
annual production 
targets
We have built up an enviable track 
record of meeting and often 
exceeding our annual production 
targets, demonstrating the 
Company’s sensible approach to 
guidance but also the expertise we 
have built in managing our portfolio 
of complex underground narrow 
vein mines. This has been 
particularly evident in periods of 
significant price volatility over the 
last five years.
Social licence  
to operate
The Company has maintained a 
number of long-term policies which 
demonstrate our commitment to a 
safe and healthy workplace, manage 
and minimise the environmental 
impact of our operations and 
encourage sustainability by 
respecting the communities of the 
localities in which we operate. Our 
relations with local communities are 
of the utmost importance and we 
dedicate significant resources in 
recognition of the social licence 
granted to us.

Increasing our 
reserves and resources
Hochschild aims to invest in 
mineralised districts with the 
possibility to grow over time and  
we are excited by the potential to 
grow our reserves and resources. 
The discovery and subsequent 
resource growth of our Pablo vein 
district at Pallancata and the  
recent discoveries at Inmaculada 
demonstrate the efficacy of our  
low cost brownfield programme. 
We believe that there are significant 
further opportunities to extend  
the lives of our mines and expand 
their capacity.
Building a  
greenfield portfolio
Our greenfield exploration 
programme incorporates 
exploration campaigns at various 
types of project. We continue to 
develop early-stage projects that 
have the potential to move through 
the project pipeline from prospects, 
to drill targets, to Advanced Projects 
and finally, to production. In this 
regard we now have six projects in 
three different countries, all in 
jurisdictions with geological

Gold Market 
Summary
Hochschild is exposed to market dynamics associated with 
the precious metals industry, whilst our operations, located in 
Peru and Argentina, are exposed to changing country-specific 
factors that can impact our business.
Market review 2017
Gold prices rose for a second 
consecutive year – by 14% on a 
Comex nearby active futures 
monthly settlement basis. This 
increase came despite negative 
factors such as a generally 
improving global economy, 
record levels in equity markets 
and a normalisation in US 
monetary policy. Political factors 
underpinned prices. 
Prices rose from $1,152 at the 
end of 2016 to an intraday high 
of $1,358 on 8 September 
2017. Escalating tensions 
between the US and North 
Korea, several policy 
implementation failures by the 
Donald T rump US government 
and politically inspired problems 
in Syria, Qatar, Iran, and 
Catalonia helped to fuel the rally 
in gold prices. Prices did lose 
some of their momentum 
during the fourth quarter, 
following an announcement by 
the Federal Reserve to unwind 
its bond portfolio and raise 
interest rates for a third time in 
2017. Prices touched an 
intraday low of $1,238 on  
12 December but with no 
changes to interest rate hike 
expectations for 2018, the  
price began to rise once again, 
finishing 2017 at $1,309. 
Demand
Net gold investment demand was 
24.4 million ounces in 2017, down 
11% from 2016. Investment demand 
had risen sharply in 2016 as it 
became increasingly evident to 
investors that the bottom in gold 
prices had been reached causing a 
move into gold, pushing up net 
investment demand sharply. The 
numerous political/economic issues 
provided ample reason for investors 
to remain interested in 2017, which 
resulted in the healthy net addition 
to investor gold holdings. While 
these additions were down versus 
2016 they were still very high by 
historical standards. Investment 
demand in 2017 was the 14th 
highest year of net investment 
demand for data over the past  
68 years. 
Central banks remained net buyers 
of gold during 2017 as they 
continued to diversify their reserve 
assets away from FX. During the first 
11 months of the year, central banks 
added a net 10.44 million ounces of 
gold to their holdings. 
The present level of additions puts 
purchases on track to match levels 
seen from 2010 to 2012. The top 
three contributors during 2017 were 
the central banks of Russia, T urkey, 
and Kazakhstan. Russia and 
Kazakhstan have been following a 
long-term programme, while T urkey 
joined the list as a buyer in May 2017, 
for the first time since 1991. 
Gold fabrication demand reached 
92.8 million ounces in 2017 up from 
92.2 million ounces in 2016. The 
increase was due to healthy 
economic conditions which typically 
increase discretionary spending, a 
softening US dollar which reduced 
the price of gold in the domestic 
currencies of consuming countries, 
and a recovery in demand from 2016 
when a gold price rise had pushed 
fabrication demand down.
Supply
T otal gold supply, which is 
composed primarily of mine supply 
and scrap, rose 0.3% to 127.2 
million ounces in 2017. A slowdown 
in mine supply growth coupled with 
Market drivers
flat secondary recovery resulted 
in the weak supply growth. 
Global gold mine supply stood 
at 97.1 million ounces, up from 
96.8 million ounces in 2016 but 
the growth is beginning to show 
signs of slowing after years of 
rises due to new capacity 
bought onstream following the 
2002–2012 gold bull market. 
Secondary supply was flat 
year-on-year at 30.1 million 
ounces as healthy gold prices 
supported it on the downside. 
Outlook 
 – Gold investment demand is 
forecast to remain healthy 
during 2018
 – Central banks are expected to 
continue adding gold to their 
holdings programmes 
 – T otal gold supply is forecast  
to rise only marginally to  
127.9 million ounces in 2018, 
up from 127.2 million ounces  
in 2017.

Gold and silver prices in 2017 
Daily settlement of nearby active Comex futures, indexed to 3 January 2017.
Market review 2017
On an average basis, silver 
prices fell slightly to $17.09 in 
2017 from $17.14 in 2016. This 
was in sharp contrast to 2016 
when short-term investors, 
alongside long-term investors, 
purchased the metal and drove 
prices sharply higher. Healthy 
global economic conditions kept 
silver prices from rising further 
although factors such as US 
tension with North Korea, the 
Syrian conflict and the Catalonia 
referendum provided a degree 
of support. In addition, 
continued equity market 
strength also played a part in 
price suppression throughout 
2017. US tax reform helped the 
stock market repeatedly hit 
record highs in December, 
further driving investors away 
from precious metals. While the 
Federal Reserve delivered three 
rate hikes in 2017, inflation did 
not become a concern, which 
was another factor that stood in 
silver’s way. 
Demand
Investors were net buyers of 108.1 
million ounces silver in 2017. The 
net additions to investor holdings 
were lower than the average added 
to inventories annually between 
2009 and 2016, but still remained 
high by historical standards. The  
net buying of close to 110 million 
ounces of silver during 2017 
remains a key factor in supporting 
silver prices.
Fabrication demand also plays an 
important role and is estimated to 
have reached 889.9 million ounces 
in 2017, down 1% from 2016 levels 
with the decline in silver use in the 
photovoltaic sector, after a record 
year in 2016, one of the primary 
reasons.
The largest single source of demand 
for silver is jewellery/silverware with 
silver use in these products 
estimated to have risen to a record 
high of 303.4 million ounces in 
2017. The rate of increase 
rebounded in 2017 to 1.4% from a 
0.6% increase in the previous year 
with jewellery demand in India 
helping to underpin demand during 
the year.
Demand from the electronics 
sector, the second largest single use 
of silver, rose to a record of 229.6 
million ounces in 2017, up 1.5% 
from 2016 with most of the increase 
estimated to have come from 
consumer electronics. In addition, 
developments in automotive 
electronics, medical electronic 
devices and automation-related 
industrial electronic products 
helped underpin silver use in the 
electronics industry.
The solar panel industry has been 
one of the fastest growing major 
uses of silver in recent years and in 
2017 it remained the third largest 
single use of silver although demand 
is estimated to have fallen by 20% to 
68.7 million ounces in 2017. 
Supply
T otal supply of silver, which is 
comprised of mine production, 
secondary supply, government 
Market drivers
disposals, and net exports from 
transitional economies, is 
estimated to have fallen by 1% 
to 998.1 million ounces in 2017. 
The faster pace of decline in 
mine supply was largely 
responsible for the decline, 
slipping by 1% to 876.9 million 
ounces in 2017. Major 
contributing countries to this 
weakness included Australia, 
Peru, and the US. T otal 
secondary supply is estimated  
to have fallen slightly to 202.0 
million ounces in 2017.
Outlook 
 – Investors are expected to 
continue adding silver during 
2018 on concerns over volatile 
global political developments 
 – T otal supply is forecast to rise, 
driven by increases in both 
mine supply and secondary 
supply
 – Fabrication demand for silver 
is forecast to resume its 
uptrend in 2018, reaching 
894.0 million ounces.

Discover
We have a strong track record of finding 
geological deposits. The value of ounces we 
have discovered in less than 10 years exceeds  
$5 billion in revenue. Our brownfield team 
believes that there is still potential at all our 
assets to find further low cost ounces and in 
addition, our greenfield team is set to drill a 
number of premium prospects in various 
countries across the Americas.
Develop
We are able to execute development of our 
discoveries in a short space of time. Our flagship 
Inmaculada deposit was first drilled in early 
2009 and production was achieved in June 2015 
with the mine being ramped up to full 
production within three months. The operation 
was also designed and built in a modular fashion 
to facilitate cost effective expansion potential.
Extract
We have developed a unique in-depth 
knowledge base of the technical challenges 
inherent in our orebodies as well as of the 
environment and jurisdiction where we operate. 
This has resulted in us consistently meeting 
annual production targets, executing significant 
cost reduction programmes, increasing our 
resource base and achieving positive results 
from brownfield exploration at existing mines. 
Shareholders
We aim to deliver sustainable low 
cost growth throughout the cycle, 
generate excess cash flow and use 
that to reward shareholders and 
other stakeholders. Since the 
middle of 2016 we have declared 
$21 million in equity dividends.
Employees
The quality of our employees is  
key to achieving our strategic 
objectives and attracting and  
retaining high quality personnel.  
The success of our business model 
helps to achieve this by ensuring 
competitive remuneration, a 
positive working environment 
through the promotion of social 
and recreational activities and 
ongoing professional development.
Communities
Hochschild has been able to  
invest in a number of local 
programmes focusing on our  
core themes of education,  
health and socio-economic 
development and allowing us to 
operate collaboratively with our  
neighbours in the Southern Peru 
Cluster for more than 50 years.

Fit for an exciting  
future of growth
I am delighted with the progress made operationally and geologically  
in 2017 as well as with our long-term goal of balance sheet optimisation. 
This has been demonstrated with our enviable track record of meeting 
our production and cost forecasts, as well as the delivery of our 
ambitious brownfield exploration programme which we believe  
is now starting to bear fruit.
Whilst a complex permitting situation in Peru  
and unpredictable precious metal prices have  
at times impacted both the management of our 
core assets and our ability to execute our drilling 
campaigns, Hochschild Mining has maintained a 
consistent strategy over the last few years which 
places geological expertise at the heart of how 
we manage our deposits and how we generate 
further low cost organic growth in the long-term. 
The Board is pleased, therefore, to be able to 
recommend an increased final dividend of 
$1.965 cents per share.
Operationally we were able to continue to grow 
our output, reaching another Company record in 
2017 with key contributions from Inmaculada 
and San Jose (both production records) and a 
vastly improved performance at Pallancata. With 
a positive gold price performance, we were still 
able to generate solid cash flow throughout the 
year despite a fall in profitability due to a rise in 
overall costs. With regards to our balance sheet, 
we took a decisive step in January 2018 with the 
early redemption of the high yield bonds, issued 
in 2014 to finance the construction of 
Inmaculada, using existing cash and lower  
Over the course of a mine’s life, geological conditions and 
mining methods may change but our commitment to safety 
remains constant and is one of our values which we are not 
willing to compromise.”

and continue to return capital to shareholders.
T owards the end of the year we started to 
receive some positive results from our 
brownfield drilling campaigns. In particular, 
I would like to mention the geological 
developments at Inmaculada which have 
confirmed our long-held confidence in the 
prospectivity of the district and I look forward 
to the team continuing to add high quality 
resources in 2018 and beyond. The majority of 
our assets are still underexplored and following 
positive changes to the permitting process in 
Peru, I believe that our organic growth 
programme is beginning to gain real momentum. 
Furthermore, it is pleasing to see an increasing 
number of greenfield targets come through the 
pipeline as well as some earn-in joint venture 
opportunities being evaluated.

Where we are
Hochschild has grown its production 
since 2012 by almost 90% and in that 
time we have reduced our costs by 
over 40%. We are still focusing on 
organic growth whether through our 
ambitious brownfield exploration 
programme at our current mines or 
through greenfield prospects spread 
across the Americas.
We made solid progress in 2017 with our 
brownfield aims – undertaking mapping 
and geophysics studies, securing surface 
drilling permits from the Peruvian 
government and subsequently starting 
our drilling campaigns at Arcata, 
Inmaculada and San Jose.
Safety and environment
As mentioned in my statement last year, an 
accident at the Inmaculada mine early in 2017 
resulted in two fatalities. With great regret, we 
disclosed that a second accident occurred at the 
Arcata mine in July 2017 which also claimed the 
lives of two colleagues. On behalf of the Board, 
I would like to again convey our deepest 
condolences to the families of the victims 
involved. Our resolve to make Hochschild Mining 
a safe place to work is as strong as ever and 
management has responded by instigating a 
wide-ranging programme to reinforce our safety 
culture which: includes senior management 
reviewing all high-risk activities; involves even 
more frequent training; focuses on initiatives 
to motivate and incentivise safe working; and 
implements the most up-to-date safety risk 
management information systems. Over the 
course of a mine’s life, geological conditions  
and mining methods may change but our 
commitment to safety remains constant and  
is one of our values which we are not willing 
to compromise.
Our focus on environmental performance 
continues to be one of our key priorities. During 
2017, we introduced a new environmental 
corporate objective as part of the Company’s 
overall Performance Objectives Plan (the base 
for calculating employee bonuses), which has 
historically been only based on production, 
safety and financial indicators. We believe that 
this new objective will help us in further 
promoting a strong environmental culture, 
achieve our goal of operating with the least 
environmental footprint possible and generate 
long-term value for our stakeholders.
Our people
Our employees are pivotal to the Company’s 
performance and, to them, I wish to express my 
gratitude for their contribution in making 2017  
a record year of profitable production. I also wish 
to thank my fellow Board colleagues for their 
support over the year. I am delighted that 
Dionisio Romero Paoletti joined the Board at the 
start of the year as a Non-Executive Director, 
bringing a wealth of business experience in Peru 
and internationally. Finally, I wish to express the 
Board’s utmost gratitude to Enrico Bombieri 
who, having served as a Non-Executive Director 
since 2012 and as Senior Independent Director 
for four years, retired at the end of 2017.
Outlook 
After an encouraging year for metal prices in 
2017, particularly for gold, the prospects for 
precious metals in 2018 remain strong with 
robust global equity markets and inflation on the 
rise. We are aiming to continue our long-term 
growth strategy based around low cost 
brownfield investment, selective greenfield 
exploration and a targeted approach to 
acquisitions. Safety, operational excellence  
and cost control will remain of paramount 
importance and we will also continue repaying 
debt as and when the opportunity arises.

Further information Chief Executive’s review
We are confident of  
our enormous potential
Hochschild delivered another record year of production whilst maintaining cost 
increases within expectations, excellent environmental performance, advancing 
our brownfield programme and continuing our drive to repay debt and optimise 
our balance sheet. We have also begun to widen our exploration focus to include 
selected greenfield projects across the Americas as well as assessing a wide variety 
of joint ventures and acquisitions that could supplement our long-term growth 
profile at a low cost.
No less important and in response to the 
fatalities that occurred during the year, I would 
like to highlight that the management team has 
designed and is implementing the ‘Hochschild 
Safety T ransformation’ plan which will reinforce 
the entire Company’s commitment to a safe 
working environment.
Operations
Our core operations produced over half a million 
attributable gold equivalent ounces (38.0 million 
silver equivalent ounces) for the first time since 
the IPO – achieving a fifth year of output 
increases and improving on our original 37.0 
million ounce silver equivalent target. This, yet 
again, demonstrates the value of our long-term 
organic growth strategy. Inmaculada was a key 
driver, delivering another record year of almost 
240,000 gold equivalent ounces at a competitive 
all-in sustaining cost of $721 per gold equivalent 
ounce ($9.7 per silver equivalent ounce). San 
Jose also achieved a record (7.1 million 
attributable silver equivalent ounces) and 
Pallancata moved strongly into a new phase with 
7.7 million silver equivalent ounces at a cost of 
$10.7 per silver equivalent ounce. At our Arcata 
mine, the effects of a lengthy permit delay to 
brownfield exploration in 2016 began to be fully 
felt with the accessing of increasingly narrower 
veins and a reduced number of stopes lowering 
production to 5.5 million silver equivalent 
ounces. We remain optimistic that, despite the 
impairment recognised in 2017, there is still 
geological potential in the Arcata deposit area 
and expect that our current drilling programme 
will enable an improvement in resource quality 
and quantity in the future. Finally, I am pleased to 
report that, during 2017, we achieved an 
excellent score in our newly implemented 
environmental corporate objective at all our 
operations. We will continue to work to maintain 
and improve our environmental culture and 
performance based on a strong belief that 
responsible mining is fully compatible with 
respect for the environment.
Exploration
Our ambitious brownfield exploration 
programme in Peru started to gain momentum 
in the second half of 2017 when, with all requisite 
permits in place, we were able to commence our 
surface drilling programmes at Inmaculada and 
Arcata. Early results from the first campaign in six 
years at Inmaculada are very encouraging and 
confirmed the presence of the Millet vein as well 
as eight other structures close to our mining 
infrastructure at the Angela vein. In Argentina, 
we had some success in discovering new 
structures close to the San Jose mine and we 
also continued to drill in the Aguas Vivas area to 
the north west where we are currently assessing 
the nature of this polymetallic orebody which has 
significant quantities of zinc and lead as well as 
precious metals. At Pallancata, the focus was on 
developing the Pablo vein in preparation for 
mining in 2018 whilst the discovery of the Marco 
vein nearby has added further resources and 
prompted a new regional geological hypothesis

Our strategy for growth
Our strategy for growth focuses on three 
key paths to secure low cost growth.
Our Strategy 
Page 18
Annual Report & Accounts 2017 
Hochschild Mining plc 16 which we will be testing in 2018. Finally, at Arcata 
we were able to discover additional inferred 
resources and throughout 2018, an intensive 
campaign will continue to explore for resources 
with the goal of utilising the plant’s significant 
spare capacity.
Financial position
Strong cash flow from our operations  
combined with some balance sheet management 
opportunities has left us in a healthy financial 
position. On 23 January 2018, we were able to 
redeem the remaining $295 million of our 7.75% 
Senior Notes. We replaced a portion of these 
bonds with short to medium term debt from 
local banks in Peru with an average rate of 2.2% 
and approximately $100 million was repaid from 
existing cash resources. Consequently, our cash 
balance after this transaction remains a healthy 
$85 million and we expect our interest costs to 
fall by approximately $20 million per year from  
2019 onwards.
Financial results
Whilst an increased average gold price received 
was offset by a moderate fall in the silver price 
received, record production once again ensured a 
rise in revenue of 5% to $723 million (2016: $688 
million). The operational all-in sustaining cost of 
$12.3 per silver equivalent ounce (2016: $11.2 
per ounce) was in line with forecasts although 
the increase reflected an increased investment in 
brownfield exploration as well as one-off project 
costs at Inmaculada and consequently this 
resulted in Adjusted EBITDA of $301 million 
(2016: $329 million). Finally, with finance costs 
reduced despite the high yield bonds (now 
repaid), basic earnings per share and adjusted 
earnings per share was $0.08 per share (2016: 
$0.11 and $0.09 per share respectively). 
Outlook
We expect attributable production in 2018 to  
be 514,000 gold equivalent ounces (38 million 
silver equivalent ounces) driven by another 
240,000 gold equivalent ounces from 
Inmaculada, an increased contribution of 
9.5 million silver equivalent ounces from the 
revitalised Pallancata mine and another 
7.1 million silver equivalent ounces from the 
dependable San Jose mine. At Arcata, where we 
expect production of 4 million silver equivalent 
ounces, management will continue to closely 
monitor performance to ensure production 
is optimised whilst maintaining the asset´s 
optionality with regards to prices, exploration 
results and cost efficiencies. All-in sustaining 
costs for operations are expected at between 
$960 to $990 per gold equivalent ounce 
($13.0 to $13.4 per silver equivalent ounce) with 
the slight increase versus the $12.3 per ounce in 
2017 resulting from further development costs 
of the Pablo vein and a one-off highly profitable 
investment in a hydraulic backfill project at San 
Jose. We are also pleased to note that the 
corporate tax rate in Argentina has been reduced 
from 35% to 30% from 2018 (and to 25% from 
2020) and, hence we can look forward to a 
significant positive impact on San Jose’s net 
profitability although taxes on dividends have 
also been reinstated to 7% through to 2020  
and then to 13% thereafter.
A further $17 million is expected to be invested 
in our brownfield exploration in 2018 as we look 
to maintain the current momentum and an 
additional budget of $10 million is assigned to 
greenfield projects with some exciting prospects 
to be drilled in Peru, Chile, Canada and the 
United States. Low cost, early-stage acquisition 
opportunities will continue to be pursued across 
the Americas and, in particular, earn-in joint 
ventures where operations can benefit from 
Hochschild’s technical expertise. We are 
confident that our exploration-led growth 
strategy will continue to add high quality ounces 
to our existing assets, generate new early-stage 
projects and deliver long-term shareholder value.

Note: silver/gold equivalent production and cost figures assume a gold/silver ratio of 74:1. Hochschild 
has increased the use of gold equivalent figures throughout the release to provide comparability to the 
gold industry peer group and due to the Company’s Inmaculada mine being a majority gold producer.
In 2017 , Hochschild once again exceeded its full year 
production target, a record 51 3,598 gold equivalent 
ounces or 38.0 million silver equivalent ounces, comprising 
254,932 ounces of gold and 19 . 1 million ounces of silver .

Costs
All-in sustaining costs from operations in  
2017 was $910 per gold equivalent ounce  
or $12.3 per silver equivalent ounce (2016: 
$829 per gold equivalent ounce or $11.2 per 
silver equivalent ounce ) driven by Inmaculada’s 
very competitive $721 per gold equivalent 
ounce (2016: $644 per ounce ) and Pallancata’s 
low costs ($10.7 per silver equivalent ounce ) 
driven by better than forecast tonnage and 
silver grades. Please see page 11 of the Financial 
review for further details on costs. 
The all-in sustaining cost from operations in 
2018 is expected to be between $960 and 
$990 per gold equivalent ounce ( or $13.0 
and $13.4 per silver equivalent ounce ) which 
includes a full year of the new detoxification 
process at Inmaculada, further development 
costs at the Pablo vein and an investment of  
$14 million in a highly value accretive hydraulic 
backfill project at San Jose. Arcata´s costs are 
expected to be higher in line with its resource 
base despite the implementation of significant 
cost control measures. An intense drilling 
campaign is expected to add higher quality 
resources during the year in order to provide 
continuity to the operation.

Further information Inmaculada  
Peru
The 100% owned Inmaculada gold/silver 
underground operation is located in the 
Department of Ayacucho in southern Peru.  
It commenced commissioning in June 201 5.
Production
In 2017, Inmaculada delivered record gold 
equivalent production of 239,479 ounces, a 5% 
improvement on 2016 (2016: 229,033 ounces) 
and represents a very successful result following 
the unexpected stoppage at the operation in the 
first quarter of the year.
Costs
All-in sustaining costs were in line with 
expectations at $721 per gold equivalent ounce 
or $9.7 per silver equivalent ounce (2016: $646 
per ounce). Costs rose versus 2016 due to the 
previously-disclosed investment in the expansion 
of the tailings dam and other infrastructure as 
well as reduced mined tonnage resulting from 
the stoppage in the first quarter and budgeted 
lower mined gold grades. These effects were 
partially offset by the processing of a high grade 
stockpile as well as operational efficiencies 
versus plan.

Strategy in action
Life-of-mine increases  
and expansion potential
Links to  
strategy
For the first time in six years Hochschild is 
exploring at Inmaculada. We have always 
aimed to invest in districts and we believe 
there is significant potential in the area 
surrounding the Angela vein where we are 
currently mining. Despite only 
commencing drilling in November 2017, 
we are encouraged that early results are 
proving the existence of a number of 
other veins close to our current mine 
infrastructure. As part of the brownfield 
programme, we are targeting a life-of-
mine increase at this flagship deposit but 
there is also a low cost opportunity to 
expand the processing plant and increase 
throughput if we find a sufficient level of 
additional resources.

Hochschild Mining plc 24 Arcata  
Peru
The 100% owned Arcata underground operation is 
located in the Department of Arequipa in southern 
Peru. It commenced production in 1964.
Production
Production for the year was 5.5 million silver 
equivalent ounces (2016: 8.0 million ounces),  
a result which reflected significantly reduced 
tonnage and lower grades following a revision of 
the mine plan to accommodate a lower number 
of available stopes and narrower veins.
Costs
In 2017, as expected, Arcata’s all-in sustaining 
cost rose substantially versus 2016 to $18.4 per 
silver equivalent ounce (2016: $13.7 per ounce) 
reflecting the significantly reduced tonnage 
(affecting unit costs) and grades resulting from 
the above mentioned revised mine plan as well as 
the increased investment in the mine’s 
brownfield exploration programme.

Securing a recovery through

exploration programme
Links to

Arcata is a complex dispersed vein  
deposit and in its long history has often 
experienced periods of more challenging 
mining conditions. However, we still 
believe there to be significant geological 
potential in the area and, now that we 
have secured the requisite permits, we 
are implementing an aggressive drilling 
programme that we are hopeful will 
secure the mine’s future. In 2017, we  
have added over 10 million ounces of 
resources and also executed a number  
of long horizontal drill holes that are 
giving us a clearer underground geological 
map. We expect these to help us in our 
2018 brownfield campaign that aims to 
improve the quality and quantity  
of the mine’s resources.

Peru
The 100% owned Pallancata silver/gold property is

Peru. Pallancata commenced production in 2007 . 
Ore from Pallancata is transported 22 kilometres 
to the Selene plant for processing.
Operating review continued
Production
The full year result was 7.7 million silver 
equivalent ounces, a 118% improvement on 
2016 (2016: 3.5 million ounces) driven by better 
than forecast tonnage and silver grades.
Costs
All-in sustaining costs at Pallancata in 2017 fell by 
34% versus the same period of 2016 to $10.7 
per silver equivalent ounce (2016: $16.3 per 
ounce). The reduction was due to higher than 
expected tonnage and silver grades resulting 
from the accessing of high grade ancillary veins 
with the wider but lower grade Pablo vein 
forecast to provide the majority of the ore in 
2018. Costs were also reduced due to Pablo 
development capex being delayed into 2018, 
which is expected to increase all-in sustaining 
costs to be between $13.0 to $13.5 per silver 
equivalent ounce.

Changing the exploration picture  
in the Pallancata district
Links to  
strategy
In 2015, Hochschild discovered the Pablo 
vein which has boosted the mine’s 
long-term prospects and in 2018 we 
expect to ramp up production 
throughout to 2,800 tonnes per day.  
The Pablo discovery initiated a 
reinterpretation of the whole Pallancata 
district and further discoveries have 
included the ancillary Pablo Pisos veins as 
well as the Marco vein to the north of 
Pablo. We have also continued mapping 
activities at the outcropping Cochaloma 
vein to the west of Pallancata and further 
mapping and geophysics studies have 
yielded two additional targets similar to 
Pablo in Pallancata South and at Farallon 
to the north west. We are aiming to test 
these in 2018.

Hochschild Mining plc 26 San Jose  
Argentina
The San Jose silver/gold mine is located in Argentina,  
in the province of Santa Cruz, 1 ,750 kilometres  
south-south west of Buenos Aires. San Jose 
commenced production in 2007 and is a joint venture 
with McEwen Mining Inc. Hochschild holds a controlling 
interest of 51% in the mine and is the mine operator . 
Production
The overall production results for 2017 were 
6.4 million ounces of silver and 100,474 ounces 
of gold, which is 13.9 million silver equivalent 
ounces, a slight improvement on 2016. 
Costs
At San Jose, all-in sustaining costs increased to 
$14.0 per silver equivalent ounce (2016: $11.5 per 
ounce) mainly due to the Q4 2016 elimination of 
the Patagonian port rebate which had lowered 
costs significantly. In addition, lower than expected 
currency devaluation in Argentina in 2017 only 
partially offset ongoing high local inflation.
In December 2017, the Argentine government 
sanctioned a series of fiscal measures that include 
a reduction in the 35% rate of corporate income 
tax, taking it to 30% for the years 2018 and 2019, 
and then to 25% for 2020 onwards. In addition, a 
withholding tax was imposed on dividends at a 
rate of 7% for 2018 and 2019, increasing to 13% 
from 2020. It is expected that the overall net 
effect on profitability will be positive.

We have not conducted exploration  
at our high grade deposit in southern 
Argentina for a number of years due to 
the political and economic situation in the 
country under the previous government. 
However, a new brownfield programme 
has begun in the area that is aiming to 
secure short-term, high quality resources 
but also look for longer-term potential 
outside of the main San Jose mining area. 
In 2017, we discovered the Agua Vivas 
orebody to the north west which contains 
not only silver and gold but also significant 
quantities of zinc and lead. In addition, we 
acquired a package of land from Coeur 
Mining situated between our joint venture

During 2018, mapping and geophysics is planned for the Inmaculada East 
zone whilst a programme of 4,500 metres of drilling for potential as well as 
53,000 metres of resource drilling is scheduled in the same area.
San Jose
At San Jose, 8,624 m of drilling for potential resources was carried out 
during the year at the Aguas Vivas zone with results indicating an 
intermediate sulphide deposit with associated zinc and lead mineralisation. 
A further 3,000 metres of drilling at Aguas Vivas is scheduled for Q1 2018. 
In addition, 5,000 metres of further resource and potential drilling was 
carried out during the year in the Molle, Odin, Ramal Ayelen and Frea E-W 
veins with selected results of both campaigns shown below:

Strong financial performance  
and cash generation
The reporting currency of Hochschild Mining plc is US dollars. 
In discussions of financial performance the Group removes 
the effect of exceptional items when indicated.
The income statement results are shown both pre and post such 
exceptional items. Exceptional items are those items, which due to their 
nature or the expected infrequency of the events giving rise to them, need 
to be disclosed separately on the face of the income statement to enable a 
better understanding of the financial performance of the Group and to 
facilitate comparison with prior years. 
Revenue
Gross revenue
Gross revenue from continuing operations increased by 5% to $759.1 
million in 2017 (2016: $722.0 million) driven by an increase in sales 
resulting from increases in production from the Company’s Inmaculada and 
Pallancata mines as well as a rise in gold prices.
1
Gold
Gross revenue from gold increased 5% in 2017 to $381.3 million (2016: 
$363.4 million) mainly as a result of a 4% rise in the average gold price as 
well as a small increase in the total amount of gold ounces sold in 2017.  
The increase in gold sales came from the recovery in the Pallancata mine 
offsetting a fall in gold sales from the Arcata mine.
Silver
Gross revenue from silver increased by 5% in 2017 to $377.8 million  
(2016: $358.7 million) as a result of a 6% increase in the total amount of 
silver ounces sold to 22,295 koz (2016: 21,088 koz) driven by a recovery  
at the primarily silver mine of Pallancata as well as increased sales from 
Inmaculada. This was partially offset by a 31% decrease in the silver sales 
from the Arcata operation.
Gross average realised sales prices 
The following table provides figures for average realised prices (which are 
reported before the deduction of commercial discounts and include the 
effects of the hedging agreements in place during the prior year) and 
ounces sold for 2017 and 2016:
Average realised prices

Gold ounces sold (koz) 300.21 298.95
Avg. realised gold price ($/oz) 1,270 1,215
 
Commercial discounts
Commercial discounts refer to refinery treatment charges, refining fees and 
payable deductions for processing concentrate, and are deducted from 
gross revenue on a per tonne basis (treatment charge), per ounce basis 
(refining fees) or as a percentage of gross revenue (payable deductions). 
In 2017, the Group recorded commercial discounts of $36.9 million (2016: 
$34.1 million). The increase is explained by the higher production of 
concentrate mainly from the Pallancata mine. The ratio of commercial 
discounts to gross revenue in 2017 was 5% (2016: 5%). 
Net revenue
Net revenue increased by 5% to $722.6 million (2016: $688.2 million), 
comprising net gold revenue of $372.3 million and net silver revenue of 
$349.8 million. In 2017, gold accounted for 52% and silver 48% of the 
Company’s consolidated net revenue (2016: gold 51% and silver 49%)  
with the increase in the gold contribution mainly due to the increase in  
the gold price received.

Hochschild Mining plc 30 Costs
T otal cost of sales was $549.0 million in 2017 (2016: $487.7 million).  
The direct production cost excluding depreciation was higher at 
$345.4 million (2016: $293.8 million) explained by higher backfill and 
detoxification costs at Inmaculada and the impact of the net inflation in 
Argentina. Depreciation in 2017 was $195.7 million (2016: $185.7 million) 
with the increase due to Pallancata’s higher tonnage extraction. Other items 
was higher at $3.2 million in 2017 (2016: $1.8 million) due to costs related 
to the community stoppage at Pallancata in January. Change in inventories 
was $4.7 million in 2017 (2016: $6.5 million).

The Group reported unit cost per tonne at its operations of $125.0 per 
tonne in 2017, an 18% increase versus 2016 ($106.2 per tonne) mainly as 
a result of new detoxification and backfill processes at Inmaculada, 
stoppages at Pallancata and Inmaculada, local inflation in Argentina and 
higher costs at Arcata, partially offset by reduced costs at Pallancata.

Further information Financial review continued
Administrative expenses
Administrative expenses increased by 7% to $51.3 million (2016: $48.0 
million) primarily due to increased share-based compensation affecting 
personnel expenses.
Exploration expenses
In 2017, exploration expenses increased to $17.2 million (2016: $9.2 
million) in line with the overall rise in the Company’s investment in 
brownfield exploration. In addition, the Group capitalises part of its 
brownfield exploration, which mostly relates to costs incurred converting 
potential resource to the Inferred or Measured and Indicated category. In 
2017, the Group capitalised $2.3 million relating to brownfield exploration 
compared to $1.3 million in 2016, bringing the total investment in 
exploration for 2017 to $19.5 million (2016: $10.5 million). 
Selling expenses
Selling expenses decreased by 22% versus 2016 to $11.0 million (2016: 
$14.2 million) mainly due to the elimination of export duties at San Jose. 
Selling expenses in 2017 consisted mainly of logistic costs for the sale of 
concentrate whilst 2016 expenses also included approximately 1.5 months 
of export duties on concentrate until their elimination on 12 February 
2016. Previously, export duties in Argentina were levied at 10% of revenue 
for concentrate.
Other income/expenses
Other income before exceptional items was $10.2 million  
(2016: $33.1 million). The reduction is mainly due to the elimination  
of the Patagonian port rebate (2016: $16.7 million) in the fourth  
quarter of 2016.
Other expenses before exceptional items were reduced to $11.5 million 
(2016: $13.9 million). 
Adjusted EBITDA
Adjusted EBITDA decreased by 9% over the period to $300.8 million  
(2016: $329.0 million) driven primarily by production costs.
Adjusted EBITDA is calculated as profit from continuing operations before 
exceptional items, net finance costs and income tax plus non-cash items 
(depreciation and changes in mine closure provisions) and exploration 
expenses other than personnel and other exploration related fixed expenses.

Finance income 
Finance income before exceptional items of $5.9 million increased from 
2016 ($1.1 million) primarily due to the impact of a higher net present 
value of the Patagonian port rebate ($1.9 million) which was discounted in 
2016 but collected in 2017. The remainder consists of interest received on 
deposits ($1.6 million) and other financial income ($2.4 million) which 
included a gain on sale of shares ($1.4 million) and a gain on derivative 
instruments ($0.6 million).
Finance costs
Finance costs decreased from $30.5 million in 2016 to $26.1 million in 
2017, principally due to the reduction of interest resulting from the 
repayment of Scotiabank medium term loan in H1 2016 and from lower 
average short-term borrowings.
Foreign exchange losses 
The Group recognised a foreign exchange loss of $5.3 million (2016: 
$1.8 million loss) as a result of exposures in currencies other than the 
functional currency – primarily the Argentinean Peso.
Income tax
The Group’s pre-exceptional income tax charge was $13.5 million (2016: 
$47.6 million). The substantial decrease in the charge is explained by the 
Group’s decrease in profitability in the year in addition to a deferred tax 
credit recognised as a result of a progressive tax rate reduction in Argentina 
from 35% to 30%. 
The effective tax rate for the period was 20.2% (2016: 40.7%). The 
reduction in the effective tax rate is mainly due to the positive deferred tax 
impact of the Argentina tax rate reduction which is non-recurring.
Exceptional items 
Exceptional items in 2017 totalled a $0.5 million gain after tax (2016: 
$6.4 million loss). Exceptional items principally included impairment 
reversals of $31.9 million for Pallancata and $8.4 million at San Felipe 
partially offset by a $43.0 million impairment of Arcata. 
The tax effect of exceptional items amounted to a $3.3 million tax charge 
(2016: $2.2 million tax credit) although this did not include the impairment 
reversal at San Felipe, which did not attract a deferred tax liability as no tax 
asset arose when the impairment was originally carried out.
8 Adjusted EBITDA has been presented before the effect of significant non-cash (income)/expenses related to changes in mine closure provisions and the write-off of property, plant and equipment.

in financing activities 4,919 (132,165) 137,084
Net increase in cash and cash 
equivalents during the year 117,784 56,544 61,240
Operating cash flow decreased from $316.1 million in 2016 to $233.9 
million in 2017. Lower operating cash flow is mainly due to: (i) income tax 
payments in 2017 of $26 million in Argentina, of which $17 million 
corresponded to income tax from 2016 and the rest to income tax 
advances for the 2017 period; (ii) the reduction of working capital 
achieved in 2016 (excluding the income tax effect) of $37 million and 
maintained during 2017; (iii) higher production costs and exploration 
expenses partially offset by stronger revenue. 
Net cash used in investing activities decreased to $121.1 million in 2017 
from $127.4 million in 2016 mainly due to reduced capital expenditure at 
Arcata, Inmaculada and care and maintenance expenditure at the Azuca 
and Crespo projects, partially offset by an increase in Pallancata investment. 
Finally, cash flows generated from financing activities resulted in a net 
inflow of $4.9 million in 2017 from $132.2 million used in 2016. In 2016, the 
$132.2 million used was due to $107.4 million of debt repayment and the 
remainder by equity dividends of $7.0 million paid to Hochschild 
shareholders and also $13.0 million to McEwen Mining. The change in  
2017 is primarily due to the net increase in short-term credit lines of  
$31.5 million ($25 million repaid in January 2017 in Peru, $50 million  
raised in December 2017 in Peru to re-purchase the bonds and $6.5 million 
raised in Argentina during the year). This was partially offset by dividends 
paid to Hochschild’s shareholders of $14.0 million and to minority 
shareholders in Argentina of $12.3 million. As a result, total cash flows 
resulted in a net increase of $117.8 million from $56.5 million in 2016 
($61.2 million improvement).

The Group’s working capital position changed by $6.2 million to  
$64.9 million in 2017 from $71.1 million in 2016. Key drivers were: higher 
income tax receivable ($24.5 million) resulting from $24.2 million of tax 
payments in Argentina; a negative movement in other financial assets/
(liability) of $4.3 million from a liability position in 2016, to an asset 
position in 2017 resulting from the embedded derivative associated with 
provisional pricing and higher trade. These were partially offset by: an 
increase in trade and other payables and provisions of $(16.9) million 
mainly due to Pallancata’s trade payables in line with its higher production.

Hochschild Mining plc 36 Governance of Corporate Social Responsibility 
(‘CSR’)
The Board has ultimate responsibility for establishing Group 
policies relating to sustainability and the CSR Committee has 
been established with the responsibility of focusing on 
compliance and ensuring that appropriate systems and 
practices are in place.
What is Hochschild Mining’s approach 
to sustainability?
The Company has adopted a number of policies demonstrating 
our commitment to:
 – a safe and healthy workplace;
 – managing and minimising the environmental impact of our 
operations; and
 – encouraging sustainability by respecting the communities of the 
localities in which we operate;
all in compliance with applicable laws, regulation and the 
Company’s own standards.
For further information on how we prioritise our resources 
and the Committee’s terms of reference, please visit 
www.hochschildmining.com/en/sustainability. 
Management of sustainability 
The Board has ultimate responsibility for establishing Group 
policies relating to sustainability and ensuring that appropriate 
standards are met. The CSR Committee has been established 
as a formal committee of the Board with delegated 
responsibility for various sustainability issues, focusing on 
compliance and ensuring that appropriate systems and 
practices are in place Group-wide to ensure the effective 
management of sustainability-related risks.
As Chairman of the CSR Committee, Graham Birch has Board 
level responsibility for sustainability issues to whom the Vice 
President of Operations and the Vice President of Legal and 
Corporate Affairs report for sustainability issues. 
The CSR Committee’s work in 2017
During the year, the CSR Committee:
 – considered the investigations into the fatal accidents 
during the year and monitored the implementation of 
corrective actions;
 – approved the 2016 Sustainability Report for inclusion in 
the 2016 Annual Report;
 – monitored the execution of the yearly plan in each of the 
four key areas of focus including progress updates;
 – considered the priorities of the environmental team 
and their work plan;
 – considered the status of the Group’s community 
initiatives; and
 – reviewed the environmental and community relations 
related risks and related work plans.
Given the exposure of the Group’s strategy to Sustainability 
Risks (comprising Health & Safety, Community Relations  
and Environmental risks), the full Board received regular 
presentations on how such risks are managed. Furthermore, 
the Board received presentations from management on the 
accidents that resulted in the fatalities during the year. Further 
details of these accidents can be found in the Safety section of 
this report.
Reporting of targets and indicators
As part of the Company’s ongoing strategy to make more 
information available online, detailed sustainability related 
performance indicators as well as targets for 2018 are 
available on the Company’s website.

Dear Shareholder
2017 was a successful year from an 
operational perspective as well as with 
regards to the sheer number of 
environmental and community initiatives  
that we were able to pursue. However, it  
is with great regret that the accident that  
we announced early last year was followed,  
in July, by a second accident at Arcata,  
which claimed the lives of two drill workers. 
These incidences brought to an end three 
consecutive years without any fatalities.
The Company Chairman, in his statement 
earlier in this Report, conveyed the Board’s 
condolences to the families of those involved 
which I wish to reiterate. The Board, and 
indeed, the CSR Committee are wholly 
committed to doing all we can to ensure  
that safety comes first. For this reason,  
we wholeheartedly support management  
in the implementation of the Safety Culture 
T ransformation Plan. This is a multi-faceted 
Given the inherently high risk  
profile of mining, safety is our 
highest priority.
2017 highlights
 – Launch of the Safety Culture T ransformation 
Plan following the fatal accidents during the 
year (see below for further details)
 – Development of the internally-developed 
safety software tool, ‘Safety HOC’ 
(see opposite) 
The Hochschild approach to safety
Mining has an inherently high risk profile and 
safety is our highest priority. Ensuring the safety 
of the Group’s employees is considered crucial in 
measuring the successful implementation of 
corporate strategy to which the Board and 
management are committed.
Safety 
strategy to meet our Zero Accident target. 
Further details on the accidents are provided in 
the Safety section of this report.
Our communities 
In 2017, we continued to promote community 
projects that fall within our chosen areas of 
focus; Education, Health and Socio-Economic 
Development. These include smaller versions of 
the Digital Centre that was established in our 
flagship Chalhuanca Project, which are being 
installed, jointly with other commercial partners, 
in rural locations. We also supported schools, by 
not only facilitating innovative teaching methods 
but also by supplying lunch kits. This ensured 
that children benefited from a healthy meal and 
learnt the benefits of a balanced and nutritious 
diet. Further details on these initiatives, as well as 
those of our Argentinian operation, can be found 
in this report and on our website.
Our environment
With regards to our environmental performance, I 
am delighted to report on the success of the 
inaugural year of the use of the Environmental 
Corporate Objective (‘ECO’). The ECO  
score for the year , which is explained in the 
Environment section of the Report, was higher 
than the most stretching target approved by the 
Board, demonstrating an environmentally 
conscious approach across the organisation. 
The ECO score was incorporated as one of the 
corporate objectives and therefore eligible 
employees will, justifiably, see some recognition 
for this impressive achievement. For further 
details, please see the final page of this report.
I hope you will find this report informative. If 
you should have any questions or comments, 
please do not hesitate to contact me at

management reports. 
The tool has three modules with the planned 
addition of the Accident Investigations and 
Management Inspections modules. A version for 
installation as an app on a smartphone is in the 
process of being developed.

Accidents in 2017
After three consecutive years without any 
fatalities, it is with regret that there were two 
fatal accidents over the course of 2017 which 
resulted in four fatalities. In this section of the 
report, we have summarised the details of each 
incident and the remedial actions taken.
Response to 2017 Accidents
In light of the findings into 
the causes of the two serious 
accidents during the year , a 
programme comprising short-
term actions and longer-term 
actions, to be implemented over 
three years, was put in place.
Long-term Action Plan:
The Safety Culture T ransformation Plan
January 2017: Inmaculada 
Overview: After the blasting of a stope, 
contractors were instructed to apply shotcrete 
to support the area. Inspections of the area were 
carried out some days after the blasting and 
support work commenced. During this process, 
the ceiling collapsed, as a result of which two 
contractors sustained fatal injuries.
The investigation resulted in a number of actions 
being taken, including:
 – reiterating compliance with the Company’s 
protocols on stope expansion and geotechnical 
support within prescribed timescales;
 – engagement of consultants for an immediate 
audit of stopes, and ongoing monitoring; and
 – more frequent mine planning sessions with the 
participation of all technical departments.
Risk Management System (RMS)
 – Review Hochschild RMS and upgrade  
to latest DNV version 7.0 ISRS 
(International Safety Regulations System)
 – External audit, by DNV , of RMS across all 
operations completed in mid-February
 – Review of all HOC protocols and 
procedures in process for completion  
by the end of 2018
Leadership Programme
 – New safety committee with  
senior management involvement in the 
review of potential high impact events
 – Coaching programme for operations 
management team led by DuPont
 – 10-month leadership programme for 
mine supervisors
 – Independent safety promoters have 
been hired at all mines
Mines’ Annual Training Programme
 – Redesigned structure and content of 
weekly training sessions. T raining 
sessions for mine workers comprise 
3 modules of c. 5 hours per week in 
the areas of practical safe working, use 
of technology and safety leadership
Safety Plan communications support
 – Activities detailed herein, together  
with safety achievements and risks 
communicated to all individuals through 
a corporate communication plan
Immediate Action Plan
 – Messaging from senior management on the 
non-negotiable zero tolerance to accidents 
 – Safety top management leadership meetings
 – World-renowned consultancy, DuPont,  
were engaged to conduct a safety culture 
assessment with the participation of 750 
employees. Concluded that HOC had the 
potential to achieve industry-leading status 
 – Increased safety supervision implemented 
 – Clinical psychologists recruited at all sites
 – Re-allocation of work between employees  
on the basis that ‘expert workers are  
safer workers’
July 2017: Arcata 
Overview: T wo drill workers were overcome by 
carbon monoxide fumes in the process of 
inspecting and clearing a stope.
The resulting investigation prompted the 
following actions (among others):
 – reiterating compliance with the Company’s 
safety protocols including the need to carry 
back-up emergency equipment at all times;
 – restructuring the emergency response teams 
by converting the nature of the positions from 
voluntary to full-time positions;
 – enhancing the provision of detection 
equipment; and
 – reinforcing various protocols including the 
mandatory use of air injection paths for access.

Health & Hygiene 
Given the nature of the work and the two-week 
shift patterns which result in frequent periods of 
absence from families, the Group recognises the 
importance of ensuring the mental wellbeing of 
its employees. For this reason, the Group’s 
Health & Hygiene teams are also trained in 
occupational psychology.
Our Health & Hygiene teams undertake their 
work in line with the following guiding principles:
 – Prevention comes first
 – Maximising quality of life
 – Adopting measures for the long-term benefit 
of our people
 – Proactively identifying and controlling hazards 
at source
 – Contributing to the continuous improvement 
in the Group’s Health & Safety culture
Our achievements in 2017
The Health team, in collaboration with other 
departments, including the Safety team, 
continued to go beyond its traditional area of 
prevention and sought to influence the way that 
employees approach their tasks.
During the year:
 – senior members of the team participated  
in discussions with respect to new legal 
requirements and provided training to  
team members;
 – a comprehensive programme aimed at 
minimising, if not eradicating, exposure to 
harmful levels of noise was implemented 
during the year. This involved:
 – the procurement of specialist monitoring 
equipment to gauge the level of exposure;
 – the medical examination of workers at all 
operations; and
 – the preparation of informational material 
highlighting the risks and encouraging the  
use of protective equipment which is  
readily available.
The work of Health & Hygiene is to 
provide an integrated approach to 
employee welfare. 
2017 highlights
 – Participation in the design of the Safety 
Cultural T ransformation Plan
 – Liaison with mining peers and 
governmental authorities on new laws 
affecting health and safety at work
 – Holding of the inaugural family welfare 
event in Arequipa
 – Doubling the number of occupational 
psychologists to cater for the provision 
of counselling
The Hochschild approach  
to health and hygiene
Underlining the importance we place on our 
people and their wellbeing, the Group’s Health & 
Hygiene department is tasked with providing an 
integrated approach to employee welfare. Whilst 
the Health team is focused on ensuring that 
employees have access to the relevant services 
and infrastructure to ensure that treatment can 
be provided, the Hygiene team looks to reinforce 
the importance of the quality of life at work 
through the prevention of occupational illness.
Family welfare event
The Health & Hygiene team held the inaugural 
family welfare event in Arequipa aimed at 
providing mineworkers’ families with support  
and advice.
The sessions provided families with the 
opportunity to share their experiences. Medically 
trained staff gave presentations with advice on 
dealing with the pressures of shift-working on 
family life. 
Annual Report & Accounts 2017 
Hochschild Mining plc 40 Activities in 2017
The people-focused initiatives during the year 
included the following:
Developing our people
In light of the limited budgetary resources, 
training and development programmes were 
targeted on key technical areas. In Peru, 
managers from across the mining units 
participated in various technical and leadership 
based courses.
Managing our talent
The People Review process was undertaken 
which maps talent within the organisation and 
identifies key positions and succession plans.
Creating a better place to work and 
Enhancing the Working Environment 
The Group continues to make use of an 
Organisational Climate Survey which has been 
widely acknowledged as a key tool to measure 
levels of satisfaction amongst employees and to 
identify opportunities for further development. 
At the end of the year, the Company initiated the 
2017 Climate Survey. Its results will be used to 
improve conditions in our mining units and 
administrative offices. Results will be reported on 
in the 2018 Annual Report.
The Group continually reviews its offering of 
non-financial benefits which currently comprise 
flexible working hours for Head Office staff over 
the summer period and the holding of regular 
social events.

The Hochschild approach  
to our people
Training and development
The quality of our people is key to the success of 
the business in achieving its strategic objectives 
and our ongoing objective is therefore to attract 
and retain high quality personnel. The Company’s 
Human Resource team seeks to achieve this by 
providing competitive remuneration, a positive 
working environment through the promotion of 
social and recreational activities, and ongoing 
professional development.
Group values, labour relations  
and human rights
Amongst the primary responsibilities of the 
Human Resources team is the clear 
communication of the Group’s corporate values: 
Integrity, T eamwork, Quality and Excellence, 
Responsibility and Commitment to our People. 
These values are embodied in our Code of 
Conduct which, amongst other things, sets out 
our undertakings to treat all employees fairly and 
to respect the right to be free of harassment or 
intimidation in the workplace. We recognise the 
core labour rights principles and, in this respect, 
support the right to freedom of association and 
collective bargaining.
Approximately 58% of our total workforce is 
represented by a trade union or similar body. As 
a signatory of the Global Compact of the United 
Nations, Hochschild Mining respects the human 
rights of all of the Company’s stakeholders 
including those of our employees, our 
contractors and suppliers, as well as the 
members of our local communities.
The importance placed by the Company on 
human rights is reflected in the Group’s training 
programme which seeks to ensure that all 
employees are aware of their rights and the 
Company’s commitments.

Secondary education 
Hochschild has continued to support programmes 
that promote personal development and basic 
economic/business awareness to equip those in 
secondary education for their early adult years.
Over the course of 2017, we have collaborated 
with over 500 secondary students and almost  
100 teachers across seven educational 
establishments.
Digital centres 
After the success of the Group’s flagship 
Chalhuanca Project, Hochschild has worked with 
TECSUP, IDAT and CISCO, to establish digital 
centres to promote online literacy. A training 
programme is being implemented in 2018 to 
ensure that full advantage can be taken of the 
equipment provided.
Health
Medico de Cabecera  
(the Travelling Doctor programme) 
This programme enables the Group to bring a 
mobile health service to those living in the most 
remote locations. Valued by the young and the 
old, the T ravelling Doctor programme brings 
coverage that local state health services cannot 
provide. In 2017 a total of 8,000 medical 
attendances were facilitated.
Socio-economic development
Business networks 
This successful programme has seen over 250 
agricultural and livestock producers flourish in 
their trade. Having been established in 2013, 
with only 25 beneficiaries, there has been an 
impressive level of take-up of the support 
provided by the Group. The project was originally 
set up with community members living close to 
the Inmaculada mine and, today, they are 
suppliers to the mine’s catering contractors.
Argentina
The Group has also promoted, in conjunction 
with its joint venture partner, a number of 
initiatives at its San Jose operation in Argentina. 
These have included:
 – scholarship opportunities;
 – the training of students from the town of 
Perito Moreno, located close to the mine, in 
the areas of drilling and explosives handling and 
who were subsequently employed by the 
Group; and
 – supporting local cultural causes,  
including funding a local museum and its 
showcasing of the cave paintings from the 
Cueva de los Manos.

 – Reviewed and updated strategies for 
Community Relations and social support
 – Using the Chalhuanca Project as a 
blueprint, implemented smaller urban 
digital centres
 – Continued support of causes located close 
to the Group’s Argentinian joint venture
Our view of working with  
our communities
Through a long-standing collaboration, we have 
tailored our approach so that we interact with 
each community by respecting their customs 
and social dynamics. By doing so, the Community 
Relations team can focus on prioritising their 
specific needs and hence the Group’s efforts and 
its intervention strategies.
Our achievements in 2017
Further details of some of the high impact 
initiatives pursued during the year are 
provided below.
Education
Elementary education 
Contributing to the education of community 
members living close to our operations has been 
an established part of our social support. Each 
year we evaluate programmes and direct our 
efforts to those where we maximise value for 
students, teachers and parents.
In 2017, we decided to support extra-curricular 
activities which combined the teaching of 
academic subjects with play. This was 
complemented by the delivery of lunch kits that 
will not only improve the provision of school 
lunches but will also facilitate concentration 
during school hours and also teach children the 
importance of a well-balanced, nutritious diet. 
This year almost 300 students and over 60 
teachers were supported across 11 schools.

The Hochschild approach to 
environmental management
Hochschild Mining is committed to being a  
leading global mining company in environmental 
performance, sourcing minerals with the least 
environmental footprint possible.
Hochschild recognises that environmental and 
social responsibility extends beyond the life of our 
operations and as a result, mine closure plans are in 
place to restore areas where mining activity has 
ceased and the Company operates a policy of 
progressively closing historic mine components. 
During the year, a review of a number of these 
plans was undertaken with the support of 
internationally recognised consultants.
Managing our environmental impact

findings by the Peruvian environmental 
regulator falling steadily from 50 in 2014  
to 7 in 2017
 – 2017 ECO score of 4.75, exceeding the most 
stretching environmental performance target 
set by the Board for 2017 of 3.5 (see box 
below on what this score reflects)
 – Launched integrated waste management 
service in collaboration with a specialist 
contractor which will incorporate the following:
 » Integrated waste management plans across 
all operations
 » Waste minimisation 
 » On-site waste collection
 » Disposal of hazardous waste and sale  
of marketable waste
 » Management of on-site waste facilities
 – Overhaul of water treatment plants across all 
Peruvian operations
Mission of the Environmental Team
In order to achieve the Company’s environmental 
mission, the Environmental team is committed to:
 – ensuring compliance with all legal and 
environmental regulations in place;
 – setting an annual environmental performance 
goal for all Company employees;
 – requiring an efficient use of resources, aiming 
for savings by implementing the best industrial 
and mining practices, modern technologies and 
solid procedures for environmental 
management and control;
 – requiring all Company employees to adopt  
an environmentally conscious culture;
 – providing all Company employees with the 
necessary resources and training to take 
environmentally appropriate decisions;
 – promoting innovative and forward thinking  
in the development and execution of new 
concepts and designs related to environmental 
management; and
 – requiring those that perform activities for 
Hochschild Mining to abide by the Corporate 
Environmental Policy.
Environmental Corporate 
Objective (‘ECO’ score)
The ECO score was developed 
in order to align all employees 
with one common environmental 
mission, thereby making everyone 
accountable for their actions.
The ECO score is used in the annual bonus 
scorecard for all eligible employees and is  
based on measurable and transparent 
environmental metrics. The scorecard was 
trialled in 2016 to create a baseline, and 
therefore 2017 was the first year that a  
target ECO score has been implemented.
The ECO score is calculated by monitoring 
performance across all operations and reflects 
each of the following:
 – Zero tolerance to non-compliance with 
discharge limits and environmental incidents, 
such as spillages
 – The number of observations received from  
the environmental regulator in Peru
 – Good environmental management measured 
on the basis of:
 » Water consumption per worker
 » Amount of non-recyclable waste generated 
per worker
 » Proportion of recyclable/industrial waste 
that is commercialised
 » Corporate Performance Indicator 
which tracks the number of compliance 
inspections that are passed with over 95%
These KPIs are reported on a monthly basis by 
each mining operation and communicated to all 
Company employees. Through this monthly 
publication, we try to foster healthy competition 
amongst the mining units, an effort called Green 
Challenge or ‘Reto Verde’ in Spanish.

Risk management & viability
Managing risk on
behalf of the Board
The system of risk management is embedded in the 
business to protect the Group’s resources and to 
facilitate the achievement of our strategic objectives.
As with all businesses, management of the 
Group’s operations and execution of its growth 
strategies are subject to a number of risks, the 
occurrence of which could adversely affect the 
performance of the Group. The Group’s risk 
management framework is premised on the 
continued monitoring of the prevailing 
environment, the risks posed by it, and the 
evaluation of potential actions to mitigate  
those risks.
The Risk Committee is responsible for 
implementing the Group’s policy on risk 
management and monitoring the effectiveness 
of controls in support of the Group’s business 
objectives. It meets four times a year and more 
frequently if required. The Risk Committee 
comprises the CEO, the Vice Presidents and the 
head of the Internal Audit function. A ‘live’ risk 
matrix is reviewed which maps the significant 
risks faced by the business and updated at each 
Risk Committee meeting, and the most 
significant risks as well as potential actions to 
mitigate those risks are reported to the Group’s 
Audit Committee, which has oversight of risk 
management on behalf of the Board.
2017 Risks
The key business risks affecting the Group set 
out in this report remain largely unchanged 
compared to those disclosed in the 2016 Risk 
Management report with the exception that:
 – in light of events during the year, the discussion 
on Health & Safety risks also considers the 
specific risks associated with the transporting 
and handling of hazardous materials by both 
employees and contractors; and
 – management identified risks associated with 
the failure of critical processes supported by 
information systems during the course of the 
year and has therefore been identified as a new 
risk. The commentary also treats the subject  
of cybersecurity risk.
Reasons for the year-on-year change in the 
profile of a specific risk can be found in the 
commentary section of the relevant risk which 
also provides an outlook on the risk for the 
current financial year.

Risk Impact Mitigation Commentary
2. Operational 
performance
 
Failure to meet production 
targets and manage the cost 
base could adversely impact  
the Group’s profitability.
 – Close monitoring of operational 
performance, costs and capital 
expenditure as well as the overall 
profitability at all stages of the 
mining value chain
 – Management closely monitors 
the wide range of risks that could 
affect operational performance 
to, among other things, ensure 
the adequacy and safety of key 
mining components such as 
tailing dams, waste rock deposits, 
pipelines to service ongoing 
operations. Close liaison between 
relevant departments ensures 
that procurement, construction 
and any permitting are 
undertaken as appropriate
In 2017 the Group exceeded its production target by 1m attributable silver 
equivalent ounces with particularly strong performances at Inmaculada, 
Pallancata and San Jose.
2017 budgets across the Group continued to focus on maintaining controlled 
levels of administrative expenses and sustaining capital expenditure. As 
reported in the Financial review, the all-in sustaining cost from operations was 
kept within guidance issued at the beginning of the year at $12.3 per silver 
equivalent ounce.
Management has been closely monitoring performance of the high cost Arcata 
mine to ensure that production is optimised while at the same time maintaining 
the asset´s optionality with regards to prices, exploration results and cost 
efficiencies.
Risk Impact Mitigation Commentary
3. Business 
interruption
Assets used in the Group’s 
operations may break down 
and cause stoppages with 
material effects (in 
particular, at Inmaculada).
 – Insurance coverage to protect 
against major risks
 – Management reporting systems 
to support appropriate levels of 
inventory
 – Annual inspections by insurance 
brokers and insurers assist 
management’s efforts to 
understand and mitigate 
operational risks
Mitigating actions during the year include the following:
 – Insurance advisers conducted site visits and completed a full review of 
operational risks to ensure that adequate property damage and business 
interruption risk management processes and insurance policies are in 
place at our operations
 – Management reporting systems ensured that an appropriate level of 
inventory of critical parts is maintained 
–  Adequate preventative maintenance programmes, supported by the SAP 
Maintenance Module, are in place at the operating units
Risk Impact Mitigation Commentary
4. Information 
security and 
cybersecurity
Failure of any of the Group’s 
business critical information 
systems, whether as a result 
of design/maintenance or 
unauthorised access by third 
parties, may affect the 
Group’s ability to operate.
 – Currently compliant with 
ISO 27001, an internationally 
recognised certification to 
evaluate information security 
management systems
 – Dedicated team within the 
IT department focused on 
preventing cyber-attacks
 – Audits performed by the internal 
audit department and third 
parties to test systems and issue 
recommendations
During the year management identified vulnerabilities in certain automated 
processes. This prompted a wide-ranging review of the procedures 
deployed in the testing of system updates which also incorporated 
mitigating steps to counter the risk from external unauthorised access.
This review included:
 – the engagement of external and internal Auditors to identify 
improvements to the Group’s procedures;
 – additional manual controls introduced to supplement automated processes;
 – in addition, the Audit Committee has set objectives for 2018 to:
 – further explore information vulnerabilities, benchmarking of our 
protection systems and recommend mitigation procedures; and
 – improve the Group´s protocols in case of a crisis.
Risk Impact Mitigation Commentary
1. Commodity  
price
 
Adverse movements in 
precious metal prices could 
materially impact the Group 
in various ways beyond a 
reduction in the financial 
results of operations. These 
include impacts on the 
feasibility of projects, the 
economics of mineral 
resources and heightened 
personnel retention and 
sustainability related risks.
 – Constant focus on maintaining a 
low all-in sustaining cost of 
production and an efficient level 
of administrative expense
 – Flexible hedging policy that 
allows the Company to contract 
hedges to mitigate the effect of 
price movements taking into 
account the Group’s asset mix 
and forecast production
 – Policy to maintain low levels of 
leverage to ensure flexibility 
through price cycles
See the Market Review on pages 10 
to 11 for further details
The focus on conserving capital and optimising cash flow continued in 2017 
through:
 – controlling operating and administrative costs;
 – optimising sustaining capital expenditure;
 – debt reduction and refinancing; and
 – maintaining low working capital
In relation to debt reduction and the refinancing of debt, the Company 
announced in 2017 the early redemption of its bonds, which was 
subsequently completed in early 2018. By doing so, debt has been reduced 
by approximately $95 million and the balance replaced with shorter-term 
debt on significantly better terms, saving the Group approximately $7m in 
interest expenses in 2018 and approximately $20m per year thereafter.
As reported earlier in this report, the Inmaculada mine had a record year in 2017 
in terms of production but also as the lowest cost operation in the Group’s 
portfolio. It has been key in reducing overall average production costs.
Even though currently no part of 2018 production has been hedged, the Group’s 
flexible policy enables the Board to approve hedging contracts to protect cash 
flow as and when appropriate

5. Exploration 
and reserve 
and resource 
replacement
 
The Group’s future 
operating margins and 
profitability depend upon its 
ability to find mineral 
resources and to replenish 
reserves.
 – Implementing and maintaining an 
annual exploration drilling plan
 – Ongoing evaluation of 
acquisition and joint venture 
opportunities to acquire 
additional ounces
 – High-end technology 
implemented to improve the 
estimate of mineral resources
The progress of the 2017 brownfield exploration programme in Peru was 
subjected to delays due to extended timelines in obtaining the requisite 
governmental permits.
As a direct result, a Permitting Committee was established during the year 
comprising personnel from the Legal, Environmental and Community 
Relations teams as well as members of senior management to plan and 
execute a co-ordinated effort to address the administrative delays.
All permits required for the 2018 brownfield exploration programme at our 
operating units have been secured.
Following the drilling campaign in the vicinity of the Inmaculada mine, 
significant potential was discovered at the Millet vein system. For further 
details, refer to page 29. 
Greenfield exploration and the appraisal of acquisition/joint venture 
opportunities restarted in 2017 in light of the Group’s improved financial 
position. These have resulted in:
 – the Group securing geographically diverse greenfield optionality; and
 – arrangements to partner with other mining companies to bolster 
exploration efforts at projects considered to have geological potential.
 
Reserves stated in this 
Annual Report are estimates.
 – Engagement of independent 
experts to undertake annual 
audit of mineral reserve and 
resource estimates
 – Adherence to the JORC code 
and guidelines therein
The Group has engaged P&E Consultants to undertake the annual audit of 
mineral reserve and resource estimates.
See page 153 for further details
Risk Impact Mitigation Commentary
6. Personnel: 
recruitment  
and retention
Inability to attract or retain 
personnel through a 
shortage of skilled personnel.
 – The Group’s approach to 
recruitment and retention 
provides for the payment of 
competitive compensation 
packages, well defined career 
plans and training and 
development opportunities
Due to increased investment in the sector, turnover in 2017 was slightly 
higher than in previous years but not to a material extent. 
The Group has continued with its initiatives to improve the retention of 
employees. These include the use of non-financial benefits (e.g. flexible 
working arrangements for Head Office staff) and tailored personal 
development plans. In addition, a programme of new initiatives in the 
employee value proposition are also scheduled for implementation. These 
include the launching of initiatives related to causes that are valued by 
potential employees; providing them with the opportunity to contribute to 
innovation, community relations and environmental performance.
Retention plans for senior executives in the form of the Company’s 
Long-T erm Incentive Plan and Restricted Share Plan are also in place.
Risk Impact Mitigation Commentary
7. Personnel:  
labour 
relations
Failure to maintain good 
labour relations with workers 
and/or unions may result in 
work slowdown, stoppage or 
strike.
 – Development of a tailored labour 
relations strategy focusing on 
profit sharing, working 
conditions, management style, 
development opportunities, 
motivation and communication
 – Monthly meetings with 
mineworkers and unions to 
ensure a complete 
understanding of expectations 
and to keep all parties updated 
on the Group’s financial 
performance
Given the level of investment at the Inmaculada mine, the Group´s Peruvian 
operation does not generate taxable income and therefore there is no 
entitlement to statutory profit sharing for Peruvian mineworkers. The 
Company has, however, implemented an additional bonus to compensate for 
this situation.
As part of the salary increases agreed with the Peruvian labour unions, a new 
bonus framework was put in place to promote safety and productivity.
The uncertainty with regards to the ongoing viability of the Arcata mine has 
adversely impacted morale among workers at the operation. During 2017, 
regular meetings were therefore scheduled and held with union 
representatives to understand concerns which continue into the current year.
Early in 2018, approximately 165 workers were made redundant from the 
Arcata operation following consultation with workers and the labour union.

Risk Impact Mitigation Commentary
9. Health and 
safety
Group employees working in 
the mines may be exposed 
to health and severe safety 
risks.
Failure to manage these risks 
may result in occupational 
illness, accidents, a work 
slowdown, stoppage or 
strike and/or may damage 
the reputation of the Group 
and hence its ability to 
operate.
 – Health & Safety operational 
policies and procedures reflect 
the Group’s zero tolerance 
approach to accidents
 – Use of world-class DNV safety 
management systems as well as 
Dupont´s consultancy services
 – Dedicated personnel to ensure 
the safety of employees at the 
operations via stringent controls, 
training and prevention 
programmes
 – Rolling programme of training, 
communication campaigns and 
other initiatives promoting safe 
working practices
 – Use of reporting and 
management information 
systems to monitor the 
incidence of accidents and 
enable preventative measures to 
be implemented
Having recorded three consecutive years of compliance with our ongoing 
Zero Fatalities objective, the Group sadly reported four fatalities during 2017, 
which resulted from two separate accidents, one at Inmaculada and one  
at Arcata.
An extensive programme, the HOC Culture T ransformation Plan, is being 
implemented by management in response to these accidents in order to 
materially reinforce the Group’s commitment to safety. 
The Plan comprises the following pillars:
 – Leadership, with senior management involved in a full review of all high 
risk activities
 – Communications, focusing on initiatives to motivate and incentivise safe 
working practices
 – Training, with all personnel receiving five hours of on-site learning  
every week
 – Technical, with the migration to the latest version of risk information 
management systems and a review of the Company’s procedures
For further details, please refer to the safety section of the Sustainability 
Report on pages 38 and 39.
Following an audit on the transportation and handling of hazardous 
materials, a plan of action to mitigate the risk of injury was put in place 
which involved:
 – a review of procedures on the routes to be used to transport such 
substances;
 – a review of contracts with transporters to ensure compliance with the 
Group’s safety policy and to manage accident responses; and
 – the installation of specialist brigades at the Peruvian operations to  
attend to accidents involving hazardous substances.
Macro-economic risks
Risk Impact Mitigation Commentary
8. Political, 
legal and 
regulatory
 
Changes in the legal, tax and 
regulatory landscape could 
result in significant additional 
expense, restrictions on or 
suspensions of operations 
and may lead to delays in the 
development of current 
operations and projects.
 – Local specialist personnel 
continually monitor and react, as 
necessary, to policy changes
 – Active dialogue with 
governmental authorities
 – Participation in local industry 
organisations
Despite a pro-business administration in Peru, significant delays were 
encountered during 2017 in the securing of permits to facilitate exploration 
activity. These were primarily the result of increased bureaucracy introduced 
by the previous Administration. Simplification measures were adopted by 
the Government towards the end of 2017 and the permitting process 
timelines are expected to reduce over time.
At the legislative level, the Peruvian Congress, which comprises a majority 
from the non-governing parties, continues to implement populist measures 
that could adversely affect the mining industry. Such measures include new 
laws on the protected nature of headwaters which may oblige mining 
companies with operations in the Andes to relocate. 
The Peruvian Government’s implementation of certain treaty obligations, 
including the framework for the prior consultation law has been challenged 
and which, may, lead to a review of the validity of mining concessions.
In terms of social conflicts, the governmental authorities remain sensitive  
to conflicts between communities and mining companies and are reluctant 
to intervene with decisiveness.
In Argentina, 2017 was marked by congressional elections where the ruling 
party did not secure a majority. The Government has sought to promote 
investment through, most notably, a phased reduction in the corporate 
tax rate. 
The ongoing inflationary environment which exceeds the rate of devaluation 
of the Argentinian Peso relative to the US dollar has led to an increase in 
costs for the Group as an exporter.

 – The Group has a dedicated team 
responsible for environmental 
management
 – The Group has adopted a 
number of policies and 
procedures to limit and monitor 
its environmental impact
Environmental permitting and agency oversight in Peru remained rigorous 
during the year.
In 2017, the Group performed highly in its ECO score, which was developed 
in-house and which focuses on:
 – compliance with discharge limits;
 – minimising the number of environmental incidents such as spills;
 – minimising the number of findings from the regulator; and
 – specific aspects of environmental management including water 
consumption and waste generation.
For further details, please refer to the environmental section of the 
Sustainability report on page 43.
In addition, during the year, the Group:
 – launched an integrated waste management service in conjunction with 
specialist contractors;
 – focused on improving the water treatment plants at the Peruvian 
operations;
 – supported the business by securing the approval of permits such as with 
regards to the Pablo vein at Pallancata, new components and plant 
capacity increases across the Peruvian operations and for exploration 
at Inmaculada
Risk Impact Mitigation Commentary
11. Community 
relations
 
Communities living in  
the areas surrounding 
Hochschild’s operations 
may oppose the activities 
carried out by the Group  
at existing mines or, with 
respect to development 
projects and prospects, 
may invoke their rights  
to be consulted under  
new laws.
These actions may result 
loss of productions, 
increased costs and 
decreased revenues, longer 
lead times, additional costs 
for exploration and have an 
adverse impact on the 
Group’s ability to obtain  
the relevant permits.
 – The Group has a dedicated team 
responsible for Community 
Relations
 – Constructive engagement with 
local communities
 – Community Relations strategy 
focuses on promoting education, 
health and nutrition, and 
sustainable development
 – Allocation of budget and 
personnel for the provision of 
community support activities
 – Policy to actively recruit workers 
from local communities
As previously reported, protests by a community close to the Pallancata 
mine resulted in a blockade from November 2016 until mid-January 2017. 
The blockade did not impact the mine’s targeted production as the 
operations were at the time in the permitting process and transitioning to 
the new Pablo vein. Dialogue and new agreements between the Company 
and community representatives resulted in the lifting of the blockade.
The Group continues to actively engage with other local communities  
to understand their needs and to implement action plans in order to 
anticipate and mitigate potential conflicts.
The risk of additional stoppages or blockades will continue to be present  
if the working groups do not reach long-term agreements between the 
parties involved. 
Looking ahead to 2018: 
 – the overall political and social climate may be adversely impacted by the 
regional elections in Peru in October; and
 – at Arcata, the declining production profile of the asset has led to 
redundancies and lower economic activity in the area, which may also 
result in social unrest.
Further details on the Group’s activities to mitigate sustainability risks can be 
found in the Sustainability report on pages 38 to 43.
Annual Report & Accounts 2017 
Hochschild Mining plc 48 In accordance with provision C.2.1 of the Code, 
the Directors have assessed the viability of the 
Group taking into account the Group’s current 
position and the potential impact of the principal 
risks which could threaten the business model, 
future performance, solvency or liquidity of the 
Group.
Period of Viability Statement
As per provision C2.2, the Directors have 
reviewed the length of time to be covered by the 
Viability Statement, particularly given its primary 
purpose of providing investors with a view of 
financial viability that goes beyond the period of 
the Going Concern statement.
It has been concluded that three years is the 
appropriate time horizon in light of:
i.   the inherent uncertainty of longer-term 
forecasting in a cyclical industry which, in the 
case of precious metals, is largely driven by 
global macro-economic factors; and 
ii.   the large number of external variables  
that need to be taken into account in 
establishing any meaningful forecast  
of the Group’s business.
Approach to assessing viability
In assessing the Group’s viability, the Directors 
have considered the principal risks to which the 
Group is exposed as set out in the earlier part of 
this report. This includes those where either the 
likelihood of the risk has increased, or the impact 
of the risk has become more severe. In particular, 
the Directors have considered forecasts which 
reflect the impact of:
 – Depressed precious metal price scenarios. This 
is a key input for stress-testing and involved the 
preparation of forecasts using (i) below spot 
$16/Au oz and $1,100/Ag oz; and (ii) spot 
prices of $17/Au oz and $1,300/Ag oz.
  Should prices fall further than the lowest of 
these scenarios, the Board would oversee the 
implementation of contingency actions, such 
as the elimination of discretionary expenditure 
e.g. exploration expenditure, the reduction if 
not the elimination of dividend distributions 
and other initiatives to reduce costs across the 
business so as to maximise the production  
of profitable ounces.
 – Risks that severely threaten forecast 
production levels. The principal risks that could 
jeopardise production are those arising from 
(a) geological risk that could result in the 
variability of our reserves and production 
volume and grades; (b) temporary stoppages 
resulting from the occurrence of a 
sustainability-risk i.e. those associated with 
health & safety, environmental and community 
relations; (c) industrial unrest that could also 
temporarily affect an operation’s production 
schedule; and (d) delays in obtaining 
operational permits. 
  Management prepares operational and 
financial forecasts based on a life-of-mine plan 
assuming only reserves and resources which 
have an adequate degree of certainty. For this 
reason, forecasts do not reflect the potential  
of incremental resources added as a result of 
exploration activity which could be easily 
converted to actual production given the 
availability of spare capacity at its plants.  
This state of preparedness, together with the 
mitigating actions described above, have been 
designed to control the impact of production 
risks or facilitate the swift recovery from the 
impact of those risks; and 
 – Plausible future contingencies for example, 
governmental/regulatory action such as 
environmental liabilities, controls against which 
are described in the table above.
The viability statement analysis has also taken 
into account other mitigating actions available to 
the Group upon the occurrence of one or more 
of the principal risks. Such actions include: 
 – hedging the price at which sales contracts  
are settled;
 – operational strategies to anticipate, minimise 
and overcome production-related risks;
 – the implementation of cost and capital 
expenditure reduction programmes;
 – working capital management; and
 – active debt financing management.
For examples of the mitigating actions taken by 
the Board during the year under review, please 
refer to the commentary in the Risk Management 
section of this report. 
Conclusion
While it is always possible that combinations of 
weak precious metal prices and adverse 
operational risks could threaten the solvency and 
liquidity of the Company over the next three 
years, the Directors have a reasonable 
expectation that the Company will be able to 
continue in operation and meet its liabilities as 
they fall due over three years being the period of 
their assessment.

Directors 
The names, functions and biographical details of 
the Directors serving at the date of this report 
are given on pages 50 and 51. With the exception 
of Dionisio Romero Paoletti, who was appointed 
to the Board on 1 January 2018, all other 
Directors were in office for the duration 
of the year under review.
Roberto Dañino and Nigel Moore retired from 
the Board at the conclusion of the 2017 AGM 
and Enrico Bombieri retired from the Board on 
31 December 2017. 
Each of the Directors will be retiring and seeking 
re-election by shareholders at the 2018 AGM in 
line with the UK Corporate Governance Code.
Directors’ and officers’  
liability insurance 
The Company’s Articles of Association contain a 
provision whereby each of the Directors is 
indemnified by the Company in respect of liability 
in relation to: (i) any negligence, default, breach 
of duty or breach of trust relating to the Company 
or any associated company; (ii) execution of his/
her duties as Director of the Company; and (iii) 
the activities of the Company or any associated 
company as trustee of an occupational pension 
scheme. For these purposes, associated company 
has the meaning given to it by Section 256 of the 
Companies Act 2006.
However, a Director will not be indemnified for 
any liability incurred by him/her to the Company 
or Group companies; any criminal or regulatory 
fines; the costs of defending any criminal 
proceedings in which he is convicted; or the 
costs of defending any civil proceedings brought 
by the Company in which judgment is given 
against him/her.
The Company has purchased and maintains 
liability insurance for its Directors and officers as 
permitted by law.
Political and charitable donations 
The Company does not make political donations. 
During the year, the Group spent $5.623 million 
on supporting social and community welfare 
activities surrounding its mining units (2016: 
$4.389 million).
Relationship agreement 
Pelham Investment Corporation (the ‘Major 
Shareholder’), Eduardo Hochschild (who, 
together with the Major Shareholder are 
collectively referred to as the ‘Controlling 
Shareholders’) and the Company entered into 
a relationship agreement (‘the Relationship 
Agreement’) in preparation for the Company’s 
IPO in 2006 and which was amended and 
restated during 2014.
The principal purpose of the Relationship 
Agreement is to ensure that the Group is capable 
of carrying on its business for the benefit of the 
shareholders of the Company as a whole, and 
that transactions and relationships with the 
Controlling Shareholders and any of their 
respective associates are at arm’s length and on 
normal commercial terms.
Further details of the Relationship Agreement 
with regard to the conduct of the Major 
Shareholder are set out in the Corporate 
Governance Report on page 56 and, with regard 
to the right to appoint Directors to the Board, 
are set out on page 69.
As required by the Listing Rules, the Directors 
confirm that, with respect to the year under 
review:
i.    the Company has complied with the 
independence provisions included in the 
Relationship Agreement; and 
ii.    so far as the Company is aware: 
  a.   the independence provisions included  
in the Relationship Agreement have  
been complied with by the Controlling 
Shareholders or any of their associates; and
  b.  the procurement obligation included in the 
Relationship Agreement has been complied 
with by the Controlling Shareholders.
Conflicts of interest 
The Companies Act 2006 allows directors of 
public companies to authorise conflicts and 
potential conflicts of interest of directors where 
the Company’s Articles of Association contain a 
provision to that effect. Shareholders approved 
amendments to the Company’s Articles of 
Association at the AGM held on 9 May 2008, 
which included provisions giving the Directors 
authority to authorise matters which may result 
in the Directors breaching their duty to avoid a 
conflict of interest.
The Board has established effective procedures 
to enable the Directors to notify the Company  
of any actual or potential conflict situations  
and for those situations to be reviewed and,  
if appropriate, to be authorised by the Board, 
subject to any conditions that may be considered 
necessary. In keeping with the approach agreed 
by the Board, Directors’ conflicts were reviewed 
during the year under review.
Directors of the Company who have an interest in 
matters under discussion at Board meetings are 
required to declare this interest and to abstain 
from voting on the relevant matters. Any related 
party transactions are approved by a committee 
of the Board consisting solely of Independent 
Directors. In addition, the Directors will be able  
to impose limits or conditions when giving any 
authorisation, if they think this is appropriate.

Further information Directors’ Report continued
Going concern 
The Group’s business activities, together with  
the factors likely to affect its future development, 
performance and position are set out in the 
Strategic Report from the Inside Front Cover  
to page 49. The financial position of the Group, 
its cash flows, liquidity position and borrowings 
are described in the Financial Review on pages  
30 to 35. In addition, note 36 to the financial 
statements includes the Group’s objectives, 
policies and processes for managing its capital; 
its financial risk management objectives; details 
of its financial instruments; and its exposure to 
credit risk and liquidity risk.
As described in the Market Review on pages 10 
and 11, 2017 saw an increase in the price of gold 
of c.13% and silver relatively underperformed, 
ending 2017 just under 5% higher.
The Group has achieved record levels of 
attributable production of 38 million silver 
equivalent ounces (513.6k gold equivalent 
ounces) with strong contributions from 
Inmaculada and the Group’s joint venture,  
San Jose. With the increase in production and 
the positive gold and silver price performance, 
the Group generated robust cash flow during the 
year despite a fall in profitability due to the 
expected rise in overall costs.
As part of its risk management responsibilities, 
the Board continually reviews its capital 
structure, initiatives to reduce operating costs 
and, furthermore, contingency measures that 
can be implemented in the event that precious 
metal prices conditions deteriorate.
In conclusion, having considered financial 
forecasts and projections which take into  
account (i) possible changes in commodity price 
scenarios; and (ii) the contingency measures that 
could be taken to alleviate pressure on the balance 
sheet in the event of a fall in prices, the Directors 
have a reasonable expectation that the Group and 
the Company have adequate resources, including 
access to contingent resources, that would see it 
continue in operational existence for the 
foreseeable future. Thus they continue to adopt 
the going concern basis of accounting in preparing 
the annual financial statements.
AGM 
The 12th AGM of the Company will be held  
at 3 pm on 25 May 2018 at the offices of 
Linklaters LLP. The shareholder circular 
incorporating the Notice of AGM will be  
sent separately to shareholders or, for  
those who have elected to receive electronic 
communications, will be available for viewing  
at www.hochschildmining.com
The shareholder circular contains details of the 
business to be considered at the meeting.
Auditor 
A resolution to reappoint Ernst & Young LLP  
as Auditor will be put to shareholders at the 
forthcoming AGM. 
Statement on disclosure  
of information to Auditor 
Having made enquiries of fellow Directors and of 
the Company’s Auditor, each Director confirms 
that, to the best of his/her knowledge and belief, 
there is no relevant audit information of which the 
Company’s Auditor is unaware. Furthermore, 
each Director has taken all the steps that he/she 
ought to have taken as a Director in order to  
make himself/herself aware of any relevant audit 
information and to establish that the Company’s 
Auditor is aware of that information.
This confirmation is given, and should be 
interpreted, in accordance with the provisions  
of Section 418(2) of the Companies Act 2006.
Statement of Directors with respect 
to the Annual Report and financial 
statements 
As required by the UK Corporate Governance 
Code, the Directors confirm that they consider 
that the Annual Report, taken as a whole, is fair, 
balanced and understandable and provides the 
information necessary for shareholders to assess 
the Company’s performance, business model 
and strategy. 
Statement of Directors’ 
responsibilities 
The Directors confirm that to the best  
of their knowledge:
 – the financial statements, prepared in accordance 
with the applicable set of accounting standards, 
give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, 
financial position and profit of the Company and 
the undertakings included in the consolidation 
taken as a whole; and
 – the Management Report includes a fair review 
of the development and performance of the 
business and the position of the Company and 
the undertakings included in the consolidation 
taken as a whole, together with a description  
of the principal risks and uncertainties that  
they face.
Disclaimer 
Neither the Company nor the Directors  
accept any liability to any person in relation  
to this Annual Report except to the extent  
that such liability could arise under English law. 
Accordingly, any liability to a person who has 
demonstrated reliance on any untrue or 
misleading statement or omission shall be 
determined in accordance with Section 90A  
of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000.

Annual Report & Accounts 2017 
Hochschild Mining plc 54 Corporate Governance Report
I am delighted to present the Corporate 
Governance Report for 2017.
In this section of the Annual Report, we 
report on the Company’s compliance with 
the provisions of the 2016 edition of the UK 
Corporate Governance Code and the 
application of its principles. Your Board is 
committed to ensuring good governance to 
not only protect shareholder value but to 
further enhance it by the implementation of a 
robust framework of controls and practices.
I would like to highlight the following activities 
in this crucial area undertaken by the 
Directors during the year.
Succession planning
As highlighted in last year’s report, a number 
of changes at Board level were anticipated 
and so I am delighted that despite having lost 
the long-standing support of three 
Non-Executive Directors, we were well placed 
to ensure continuity at Board level. In 
addition, we were delighted to announce the 
appointment of Dionisio Romero Paoletti as a 
Non-Executive Director. Dionisio joined the 
Board on 1 January 2018 and brings a vast 
wealth of business experience in Latin 
America, as the Chairman and CEO of the 
Credicorp financial group.
Succession planning was not only limited to 
the Board. During the year, the Nominations 
Committee considered the status of the 
succession plans for the Group’s senior 
executives. This process involved a review  
of the key positions below Board level and 
identifying the rising talent across all 
functions. The Committee considered 
specific development plans which, supported 
by the allocation of the necessary resources, 
will further strengthen the Group’s ability  
to accomplish our operational and  
strategic objectives.
Dear Shareholder
Introduction
This report, together with the Directors’ 
Remuneration Report, describes how the 
Company has applied the Main Principles of the 
UK Corporate Governance Code (‘the Code’) 
(2016 edition) in respect of the year ended 
31 December 2017. A copy of the Code is 
available on the website of the Financial 
Reporting Council (‘FRC’) at www.frc.org.uk.
Disclosures to be included in the Corporate 
Governance Report in relation to share structure, 
shareholder agreements and the Company’s 
constitutional provisions pursuant to the 
Disclosure Guidance and T ransparency Rules are 
provided in the Supplementary Information 
section on pages 67 to 69.
Statement of compliance
The Board confirms that, in respect of the year 
under review, the Group has complied with the 
provisions contained in the Code with the 
following exceptions:
i.   the Company did not fully comply with the 
requirement that performance-related 
incentive schemes should include 
arrangements to recover or withhold variable 
pay when appropriate to do so (i.e. clawback  
or malus); and
ii.   an externally facilitated evaluation of the 
Board has not been undertaken.
In relation to (i) above, as stated in last year’s 
Directors’ Remuneration Report, the Company 
reviewed the use of clawback which, following 
legal advice, was concluded to be unenforceable 
in the countries in which the Company primarily 
operates. As reported in this year’s Directors’ 
Remuneration Report, the Remuneration 
Committee reviewed the malus policy during 
2017 and agreed to widen its remit beyond 
adverse events in relation to safety, environment, 
community and legal compliance so as to also 
include trigger events including material 
misstatement, material failure of risk 
management, action or omission resulting in 
serious reputational damage. The revised malus 
provisions will apply to all incentives, including 
the annual bonus, effective from 2018.
In relation to (ii) above, please refer to the 
Board Evaluation section below for further 
details on the internally-led approach to the 
Board’s performance evaluation.
Board evaluation
In 2017, we continued with our internally-led 
Board evaluation process which last year was 
managed by Michael Rawlinson, as our Senior 
Independent Director-Designate. The process, 
which is described in more detail in this 
report, reviewed many aspects of the 
functioning of the Board, the Committees and 
the roles played by the Directors. In addition, 
the opportunity was taken to identify topics  
of interest for incorporation of presentations 
by speakers into the annual board calendar. 
Equipping the Board with the necessary skills 
and knowledge of the sector and the global 
environment in which we operate is key, and  
I look forward on reporting on these aspects 
in next year’s report.
If you should have any queries arising from 
this report, please do not hesitate to contact 
me at Chairman@hocplc.com.
Eduardo Hochschild 
Chairman
 Your Board is committed to ensuring 
good governance to not only protect 
shareholder value but to enhance it.”

Strategic Report

Financial statements
Further information The Board
The Board is responsible for approving the 
Company’s strategy and monitoring its 
implementation, for overseeing the management 
of operations and for providing leadership and 
support to the senior management team in 
achieving sustainable added value for 
shareholders. It is also responsible for enabling 
the efficient operation of the Group by providing 
adequate financial and human resources and an 
appropriate system of financial control to ensure 
these resources are fully monitored and utilised.
There is an agreed schedule of matters reserved 
for the Board which includes the approval of 
annual and half-yearly results, the Group’s 
strategy, the annual budget and major items of 
capital expenditure.
Composition
At all times during the year, the Board comprised 
a majority of Independent Non-Executive 
Directors. At the end of the year, the Board 
comprised the Chairman, the Chief Executive 
Officer and six Non-Executive Directors, all of 
whom were considered, by the Board, to be of 
independent judgement and character.
Chairman and Chief Executive
The Board is led by the Chairman, Eduardo 
Hochschild, who is also the majority shareholder 
of the Company with a c.51% holding.
The Board has approved a document which sets 
out the division of responsibilities between the 
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer.
As Chairman, Eduardo Hochschild is responsible 
for leading the Board of Directors and ensuring 
that the Board is enabled to play a full and 
constructive part in the development and 
determination of the Group’s strategy and overall 
commercial objectives.
Ignacio Bustamante, as the Chief Executive 
Officer, is responsible for the formulation of the 
vision and long-term corporate strategy of the 
Group, the approval of which is a matter for the 
full Board.
The Chief Executive Officer is responsible for 
leading an executive team in the day-to-day 
management of the Group’s business.
Status of the Chairman
In light of his majority shareholding, the 
Chairman is not considered to be independent. 
However, during the one-to-one interviews 
conducted with each Board member, the 
Directors continue to assert that no undue 
influence is exercised.
The reasons for this are twofold. Firstly, the 
composition of the Board ensures that the 
significant presence of Independent Directors 
ensures that the views of minority shareholders 
are well represented. Secondly, the undertakings 
provided in the Relationship Agreement (as 
described below) ensure that the Company and 
its subsidiaries are capable of carrying on their 
business independently of Eduardo Hochschild 
and his associates.
The Relationship Agreement was reviewed by the 
Board in 2014 following the implementation of 
new Listing Rules applicable to listed companies 
with controlling shareholders (the ‘New Listing 
Rules’). As a result, an amended and restated 
Relationship Agreement was approved and 
adopted which, in addition to being the subject 
of a general update, incorporated revised 
independence provisions reflecting the language 
of the New Listing Rules.
Under the terms of the agreement, each of 
Eduardo Hochschild and Pelham Investment 
Corporation (being the entity through which  
Mr Hochschild holds his shares in the Company) 
(the ‘Major Shareholder’) undertakes that:
i.   all transactions with the Company (and its 
subsidiaries) will be conducted at arm’s 
length and on normal commercial terms;
ii.   neither of them (nor their associates) 
(the ‘Relevant Parties’) will take any action 
that would have the effect of preventing the 
Company from complying with its obligations 
under the Listing Rules;
iii.  the Relevant Parties will not propose, and 
neither will they procure the proposal of, a 
shareholder resolution intended or which 
appears to be intended to circumvent the 
proper application of the Listing Rules; and
iv.  the Relevant Parties will not take any action 
that would preclude or inhibit any member of 
the Group from carrying on its business 
independently of any of them.
Certain confirmations are required to be given by 
the Board under the New Listing Rules with 
regards to the Company’s compliance with the 
independent provisions which can be found in 
the Directors’ Report on page 53.
Senior Independent Director
Enrico Bombieri was the Senior Independent 
Director during the year under review until his 
retirement from the Board at the end of the year 
when he was succeeded by Michael Rawlinson. 
During that time Mr Bombieri acted as a central 
point of contact for the Non-Executive Directors 
collectively but he also served as a conduit 
between the Non-Executive Directors and the 
executive management team.
A crucial part of the role of the Senior 
Independent Director is to meet with major 
shareholders if concerns have not been 
addressed by the executive team. No such 
meetings were held during the year.
Non-Executive Directors
The Company’s Non-Executive Directors hold, or 
have held, senior positions in the corporate 
sector with the exception of Sanjay Sarma who 
has a background in academia in the field of 
mechanical engineering and technology. They all 
bring their experience and independent 
perspective to enhance the Board’s capacity to 
help develop proposals on strategy and to 
oversee and grow the operations within a sound 
framework of corporate governance.
Details of the tenure of appointment of 
Non-Executive Directors are provided in the 
Directors’ Remuneration Report.
Independence of Non-Executive Directors
The Board considers that all of the Non-
Executive Directors serving during the year were 
independent of the Company with the exception 
of Roberto Dañino given his previous role as an 
Executive Director of the Company and that, up 
until his retirement from the Board in May 2017, 
he was also engaged as a Special Adviser to the 
Chairman and senior management team.
In reaching its conclusion on the independence 
of the Non-Executive Directors serving at the 
end of the year, the Board considered:
i.   Jorge Born’s tenure on the Board of over 
nine years; and
ii.   Sanjay Sarma’s position as a director of T op 
Flight T echnologies, a company in which 
Eduardo Hochschild has a 1.25% shareholding 
and a convertible note investment.
Notwithstanding the above, the Board 
collectively feels that the above circumstances 
are not considered to be of a nature to materially 
interfere with the exercise of the respective 
Director’s independent judgement.

operations, exploration activity and financial 
situation.
Appointments and re-election  
of Directors
Board nominations are recommended to the 
Board by the Nominations Committee. There 
were no new appointments during the year.
The Company has adopted the practice of 
requiring Directors to seek annual re-election by 
shareholders in keeping with the UK Corporate 
Governance Code. The biographies of the 
Directors can be found on pages 50 and 51.
Under the terms of the Relationship Agreement, 
the Major Shareholder has (i) the right to 
appoint up to two Non-Executive Directors to 
the Board for so long as the Major Shareholder 
holds an interest of 30% or more in the 
Company and (ii) the right to appoint one 
Non-Executive Director for so long as it has an 
interest of 15% or more in the Company, and in 
each case to remove any such Director(s) 
previously appointed.
The Relationship Agreement continues for so 
long as the Company’s shares are traded on the 
London Stock Exchange or until such times as 
the Controlling Shareholders (including Eduardo 
Hochschild) cease to own or control in 
aggregate a minimum of 15% of the issued share 
capital or voting rights of the Company.
The Major Shareholder exercised this right for 
the first time through the appointment of 
Dionisio Romero Paoletti who joined the Board 
on 1 January 2018.
Board development
It is the responsibility of the Chairman to ensure 
that the Directors update their knowledge and 
their skills and are provided with the necessary 
resources to continue to do so. This is achieved 
through the various means described as follows.
Induction
New Board appointees are offered the 
opportunity to meet with key management 
personnel and the Company’s principal  
advisers as well as undertaking visits to the 
Group’s operations.
Briefings
The Directors receive regular briefings from the 
Company Secretary on their responsibilities as 
Directors of a UK listed company and on relevant 
developments in the area of corporate 
governance. In addition, the Directors have 
ongoing access to the Company’s officers  
and advisers.
Advice
The Company has procedures by which 
members of the Board may take independent 
professional advice at the Company’s expense in 
the furtherance of their duties.
Company Secretary
The Company Secretary is appointed and 
removed by the Board and is responsible for 
advising the Board on governance matters and 
the provision of administrative and other services 
to the Board. All the Directors have access to the 
Company Secretary.
Board evaluation
The Board is committed to the process of 
continuous improvement which is achieved  
in particular by the internally led Board 
evaluation process.

Further information 2017 Board evaluation
In keeping with past practice, the 2017 
Board evaluation process was undertaken 
internally through one-to-one interviews 
conducted by the Senior Independent 
Director-designate assisted by the 
Company Secretary.
The interviews were structured to seek 
Directors’ views on a number of subject 
areas including those outlined below.
The Committees
 – Composition and overall workings of the 
main Board Committees, including 
specific aspects of the performance of 
the Audit Committee, as well as of the 
Brownfield Working Group established 
to review the Group’s progress in this 
vital source of potential growth
 – Specific aspects of each Committee’s 
role and scope of responsibilities
The Board
 – The composition of the Board, focusing 
on the skills mix after the retirements 
from the Board
 – The workings of the Board
 – Strategic planning, governance  
and evaluation
Risk and culture
 – A review of the process of managing risk
 – Seeking views on the Group’s corporate 
culture and the behaviours that it 
promotes
In addition to the above, Directors were 
requested to provide feedback on the 
performance of the Chairman and fellow 
Board members.
Implementation of 2016 Board evaluation
A number of actions were taken during the year 
following the 2016 Board evaluation process. 
These included:
 – more detailed reporting to the Board on the 
work of the Remuneration Committee;
 – a presentation from management looking back 
critically at the steps taken in response to the 
significant falls in precious metal prices in 2013 
as a means of ensuring preparedness for future 
such volatile market conditions; and
 – suggestions on the content of the monthly 
Board reports to convey, among other things, 
investor sentiment to the industry in general.
2017 Board evaluation
Evaluation of the Board and Committees
The findings relating to the evaluation of the 
Board and the Committees were considered 
collectively by the Chairman and Michael 
Rawlinson as the Senior Independent Director-
Designate and the resulting recommendations 
were discussed and, where appropriate, 
approved by the Board.
Evaluation of the Chairman
The findings of the Chairman’s performance 
evaluation were collated by Michael Rawlinson 
and discussed between the Non-Executive 
Directors before being relayed to the Chairman.
Outcome
The principal recommendations arising from the 
2017 Board evaluation process can be 
summarised as follows:
 – closer supervision of the management of 
CSR-related risks by the CSR Committee;
 – further process enhancements to assist the 
flow of information between the Remuneration 
Committee and the full Board;
 – scheduling of additional meetings of the 
Directors outside of formal Board meetings, to 
promote closer co-operation particularly in 
light of recent Board changes;
 – the reinstatement of a physical Board meeting 
in August rather than via video conference; and
 – incorporation of progress updates against 
brownfield objectives in the monthly  
Board reports.
External Board evaluation
Since the process was introduced, the Directors 
unanimously consider that the internally-led 
evaluation has resulted in a number of 
recommendations that have improved the way 
the Board and the Committees function. For this 
reason, an externally led evaluation was not 
undertaken during the year. The Board 
acknowledges the benefits of an external 
appraisal of the overall governance structure and 
processes and, while it is minded to continue 
using an internal evaluation, the format of the 
2018 evaluation will be kept under review.
The Board’s Committees
The Board has delegated authority to the Audit 
Committee, CSR Committee, Nominations 
Committee and Remuneration Committee. 
Reports from each of these committees on their 
activities during the year appear on the following 
pages. Further information on the activities of 
the CSR Committee and Remuneration 
Committee can be found in the Sustainability 
Report and Directors’ Remuneration Report 
respectively.
Corporate Governance Report continued
Annual Report & Accounts 2017 
Hochschild Mining plc 58 The Audit Committee undertakes  
a crucial role in overseeing financial 
reporting and the framework of  
internal controls and risk management.”
Having assumed the Chair of the 
Committee in May, I am pleased to 
introduce my first report of the Audit 
Committee in respect of its activities 
during 2017.
The Audit Committee undertakes a 
crucial role in overseeing, on behalf of the 
Board, the quality of the Group’s financial 
reporting as well as the robustness of the 
framework of internal controls and risk 
management. This purpose is fulfilled 
through frequent and periodic reporting 
from management and auditors (internal 
and external), the review of judgements 
on subjectivities as well as ensuring the 
implementation of the necessary policies 
and procedures. The report that follows 
describes the various means by which 
these responsibilities were fulfilled in 
2017. In addition, the following aspects 
were also considered.
Review of Assurance Map
The Committee reviewed the Group’s 
Assurance Map which identifies and 
grades each source of assurance provided 
to the Committee with respect to its key 
functions. This exercise not only facilitates 
a gap analysis but it also tests the 
robustness of each source in terms of the 
provision of complete, accurate and, 
where necessary, corroborated data.
Key roles and responsibilities
 – T o monitor the integrity of the Company’s 
financial statements
 – T o monitor the effectiveness of the Company’s 
internal controls and risk management systems
 – T o review, on behalf of the Board, the 
Company’s procedures for detecting fraud  
and the Company’s systems and controls for 
the prevention of bribery, and to receive 
reports on non-compliance
 – Oversight of the Internal Audit function and 
review of its annual work plan
 – T o oversee the relationship with the Company’s 
external Auditor
 – T o review the effectiveness of the external 
audit process

Committee’s activities including details of the 
significant audit issues encountered during the 
year and how they have been addressed
Membership
The Audit Committee was chaired by Nigel 
Moore until his retirement from the Board on 
11 May 2017. Nigel had extensive and substantial 
financial experience gained in his previous role as 
a partner with Ernst & Young between 1973 and 
2003 where he was responsible for services to a 
number of significant companies, including audit 
responsibilities. In addition, Nigel had acted as 
Audit Committee Chairman for a number of 
other listed companies.
Eileen Kamerick succeeded to the chair of the 
Audit Committee on 11 May 2017. Eileen was 
formerly a Chief Financial Officer of a number of 
US-based companies and currently serves as the 
Audit Committee Financial Expert for the AIG 
Funds and Anchor Series T rust (US mutual 
funds) and Audit Committee Chair of the Legg 
Mason Closed End Mutual Funds.
Michael Rawlinson’s career in banking specialised 
in the mining sector having initially worked as an 
analyst and corporate financier, serving most 
recently as Global Co-Head of Mining and Metals 
at Barclays Investment Bank from 2013 until his 
retirement from that role in June 2017.
Graham Birch was appointed to the Committee 
on 11 May 2017 and is a former director of 
BlackRock Commodities Investment T rust plc 
and manager of BlackRock’s World Mining T rust 
and Gold and General Unit T rust.

during the year under review are considered  
to be Independent Directors and the  
Committee is satisfied that it has, as a whole, 
competence relevant to the sector in which  
the Company operates.

Whistleblowing
The UK Corporate Governance Code requires 
the Committee to ensure that the Group has 
provided employees with a facility to report 
impropriety in confidence. As described later, 
the Committee is satisfied that such provision 
is made though, in the early part of 2017, we 
commissioned a survey to gauge the 
awareness of employees as to its availability 
and purpose. While the results were 
encouraging, the survey revealed a need to 
raise awareness on how reports could be 
submitted and to provide reassurance to 
employees that adequate follow-up action 
would be taken. Please refer to the 
description of the ‘Activity During the Year’ 
section of the report below for details on the 
resulting action plan that was implemented.
Tax Compliance Strategy
In line with a new requirement, the Audit 
Committee considered a policy document 
describing the Group’s approach to the 
management of its UK tax affairs. With 
Hochschild’s mining operations all located 
outside of the UK, our UK tax footprint is 
understandably small. However, our 
commitment in respect of all tax matters is 
firm; to deal transparently with all relevant 
authorities and in a responsible manner in 
relation to tax planning. A copy of the full 
document can be obtained from the 
Responsibility section of our website.

Activity during the year
The following matters featured amongst those 
considered by the Committee during the year:
 – Financial reporting – The 2016 Annual 
Report and Accounts and the 2017 Half-Yearly 
Report were reviewed by the Committee 
before recommending that they be adopted by 
the Board. In its review of these financial 
reports, the Audit Committee reviewed 
accounting policies, estimates and judgements 
applied in preparing the relevant statements 
and the transparency and clarity of disclosures 
contained within them.
 – Review of audit plans – In line with its usual 
practice, the Committee considered reports 
from the external Auditor on the scope and 
structure of the review of the half-yearly results 
and audit of the annual results.
 – Risk management – Consideration and 
challenge of risk management assessments 
which incorporate a risk matrix detailing  
(i) the most significant risks facing the Group; 
(ii) an evaluation reflecting the likelihood of 
the occurrence of the risk and the extent of the 
potential impact on the Group, and  
(iii) commentary on the steps taken to 
manage each specific risk. See pages 45 to 48 
for a description of the principal risks and 
uncertainties faced by the Group during  
the year.
 – Internal audit – The Audit Committee 
continued to oversee and challenge the 
Group’s adoption of a risk-based approach to 
internal audit. The Audit Committee Chairman 
receives a quarterly report from the Head of 
Internal Audit which sets out specific areas 
covered, improvements being recommended 
and introduced, and proposals for the 
programme over the following three months. 
The CEO and CFO also receive copies of this 
report and robustly support the activities of 
the Internal Audit function.
 – Internal control – Through the processes 
described on the following page, the Audit 
Committee reviewed the adequacy of the 
Group’s internal control environment and risk 
management systems.
 – Whistleblowing – The Audit Committee 
reviewed the adequacy of the Group’s 
Whistleblowing Policy taking into account the 
reports received through the various online 
and offline channels established by the Group. 
(See box below for more information)
 – Fraud and bribery – The Audit Committee 
continued to review and challenge the actions 
taken by management to promote ethical and 
transparent working practices.
The Group has adopted a Code of Conduct 
which describes the values and standards of 
behaviour expected of our employees and our 
business partners. In addition, the Group has 
adopted a specific anti-bribery and anti-
corruption policy to reflect the Board’s zero 
tolerance of these types of act. This policy is 
circulated to all employees by the CEO on a 
periodic basis, highlighting the reputational 
damage and criminal proceedings that could 
result. The 2017 communications campaign 
followed certain high-profile cases of alleged 
corruption in Peru so as to maximise impact.
 – External audit –The Audit Committee oversees 
the relationship with the external Auditor who 
was reappointed following a tender process 
undertaken in Q1 2016. As part of this 
responsibility, the Audit Committee reviewed  
the findings of the external Auditor and 
management letters, and reviewed and agreed 
audit fees. The Audit Committee evaluates the 
Auditor’s performance each year taking into 
account written feedback prepared by the CFO, 
the Group Financial Controller and relevant 
finance managers from the operations. The 
issues raised are considered in detail at the Audit 
Committee meeting held mid-year resulting in an 
action plan, the execution of which is assessed in 
the following year’s auditor evaluation.
 – Auditor objectivity – The Audit Committee 
has adopted a Policy on the Use of External 
Auditors for the Provision of Non-Audit 
Services (see later section for more details).
 – Governance and evaluation – The Audit 
Committee received updates from the Auditor 
and the Company Secretary on regulatory and 
other developments impacting the Committee’s 
role. In relation to the evaluation of the 
Committee’s performance, this was carried out 
as part of the annual Board evaluation. Specific 
questions were put to each Board member on 
various aspects of the performance of the Audit 
Committee including its responsibilities in 
relation to risk management and internal 
control. General feedback on the Committee’s 
performance was also sought and fed back to 
the Committee Chair.
 – Committee objectives – The Audit 
Committee has continued its initiative of 
setting specific objectives for itself and 
management with a view to ensuring the 
diligent fulfilment of its responsibilities.
The objectives for 2017 resulted in:
 – supervision of the process of preparation of 
the 2016 financial statements in preparation 
for the expedited reporting timetable for the 
2017 financial statements;
 – a focused and tailored induction programme 
for Eileen Kamerick in preparation for 
the succession to the Chair of the Audit 
Committee. This resulted in a number of 
briefings with the external Auditors and 
relevant internal personnel such as the  
CFO, the Head of Internal Audit and the 
Company Secretary;
 – an internal communication campaign 
highlighting the Group’s anti-bribery and  
anti-corruption policies.
 – Tax Compliance Strategy – As set out in the 
introductory letter, the Audit Committee, 
approved on behalf of the Board, a document 
on the Group’s approach to UK tax matters. 
The document can be located at:  
http://www.hochschildmining.com/en/
responsibility/tax_compliance_strategy
During the year, the Committee members held 
meetings with the external Auditor without 
executive management to discuss matters 
relating to the 2016 annual audit and the 2017 
Half-Yearly Report. There were no matters of 
significance to report from these meetings.
Corporate Governance Report continued
2017 Whistleblowing campaign
As mentioned in the Committee Chair’s 
introductory letter, a survey was 
commissioned during 2017 to gauge the 
general employee awareness of the facility 
which identified a need to highlight how 
reports could be submitted and how reports 
were handled. An internal publicity campaign 
was rolled out in H1 2017 highlighting these 
particular aspects and, in addition, a shortcut 
to the online whistleblowing tool was installed 
on the desktop of every company computer 
to promote ease of access. A survey has been 
scheduled in the current year to verify the 
success of the 2017 campaign.
Annual Report & Accounts 2017 
Hochschild Mining plc 60 Significant audit issues
As recommended by the Code, the following is  
a summary of the significant issues considered  
by the Committee in relation to the 2017 
financial statements and how these issues  
have been addressed.
Impairments
The Audit Committee assessed management’s 
analysis which concluded that indicators of 
impairment (or impairment reversals) in H2 
2017 were present with regards to Arcata, 
Pallancata and San Felipe and hence, were the 
subject of a full impairment assessment.
The Audit Committee considered
i.  with regards to Arcata,
  a.   management’s evaluation of the reserves 
and resources volumes at Arcata noting 
that exploration and mining activities did 
not result in inferred resources being 
converted into reserves. Furthermore, the 
Committee considered that production 
and costs at Arcata were negatively 
affected by lower grades and tonnage;
  b.  certain key assumptions and the 
associated sensitivity analysis used in the 
recoverable value model of Arcata; 
namely price forecasts, discount rates, 
production volumes, costs and other 
operating inputs; and
  c.  the basis of calculation of the recoverable 
value of Arcata.
ii.   with regards to San Felipe, the recoverability 
assessment performed by management,
iii. with regards to Pallancata,
  a.   the conversion of inferred resources into 
Reserves from the Pablo vein;
  b.  the better than expected grades and 
tonnage from operations; and
  c.  the better than expected costs  
and production.
In conclusion, the Audit Committee concurred 
with management on the following for the full 
year ending 31 December 2017:
 – an impairment of $43 million with regards to 
Arcata; and
 – the impairment reversals with respect to 
Pallancata of $31.9 million and with respect to 
San Felipe of $8.4 million.
Going Concern Assessment
The Board and the Committee (under its 
delegated authority) regularly considered 
management forecasts on the Group’s financial 
position and the ability of the Group to continue 
as a going concern.
The Board has considered cash flow forecasts 
and undertaken sensitivity analysis of the  
key assumptions.
In addition, the Audit Committee corroborated 
its assessment through consideration of the 
processes undertaken by the Auditor in its 
testing of management’s forecasts. In conclusion, 
the Committee is content that the financial 
statements are in accordance with relevant 
accounting standards and guidance.
Please refer to the Directors’ Report on page 54 
for its confirmation to shareholders on the 
appropriateness of the Going Concern 
assumption and the Risk Management section of 
the Directors’ approach to the longer-term 
Viability Statement.
Adequacy of tax provisions
The Audit Committee considered the potential 
fines or losses that the Group may be subject to 
in light of open tax reviews and the uncertainty 
with respect to the quantum and timing of  
these liabilities.
The Audit Committee considered management’s 
assessment of these potential exposures.
In addition, the Committee considered the view 
of independent experts as well as the work of the 
external Auditor which focused on:
 – corroborating management’s assessments; and
 – changes to those assessments relative to  
prior years and the appropriate treatment  
in light thereof.
In conclusion and having had regard to 
management’s assessment, the Committee 
agrees with the treatment and disclosure of the 
potential liabilities identified.
Mine rehabilitation provisions
The Audit Committee considered the judgement 
exercised by management in assessing the 
amounts required to be paid by the Company  
to rehabilitate the Group’s mines which, with 
regards to Pallancata, was prepared in 
conjunction with an external consultant during 
the year (to supplement the decommissioning 
cost estimates prepared in 2016 with the same 
third party on the Group’s other operations).
In its assessment of the analysis undertaken 
by management (and, where relevant, the 
independent third party), the Audit Committee 
took into account:
 – the basis of the estimation of future 
rehabilitation costs;
 – the discount rate applied;
 – significant changes in estimates and the basis 
and level of new costs; and
 – the accounting for the changes in the provisions.
The Audit Committee concluded that the 
provision is appropriate.
Revenue recognition
The Audit Committee reviewed management’s 
approach to the accounting of revenue. In 
addition, the Committee considered the 
Auditor’s procedures which focused on:
 – testing the key controls around the revenue 
recognition process to confirm that they are 
designed and operating effectively, supporting 
the prevention and detection of material errors 
in the reported revenue figures;
 – the timing of sales; and
 – the appropriate treatment of provisional pricing.
As a result, the Audit Committee has been able 
to conclude that revenue has been recognised in 
accordance with accounting standards and the 
calculation of any provisional pricing adjustments 
has been performed in accordance with the 
Group’s accounting policies.
Auditor independence
The Audit Committee continues to oversee the 
implementation of specific policies designed to 
safeguard the independence and objectivity of 
the Auditor, which includes the Group’s policy on 
the provision of non-audit services.
Policy on the use of Auditor  
for non-audit services
Following the issue of the new consolidated 
Ethical Standard for Auditors by the Financial 
Reporting Council, the Audit Committee adopted 
a revised Policy in 2016 on the use of the Auditor 
for non-audit services (the ‘Revised NAS Policy’).
The Revised NAS Policy lists those non-audit 
services that the external Auditor is specifically 
prohibited from providing. In summary, these 
include (a) tax services; (b) bookkeeping; (c) 
payroll services; (d) designing or implementing 
internal control or risk management procedures 
with regards to financial information or related 
technology systems; (e) valuation services; (f) 
certain legal services; and (g) corporate finance 
type services. Certain of these services may be 
provided by the Auditor subject to the 
satisfaction of certain criteria ensuring the 
Auditor’s objectivity and the Audit Committee’s 
approval. The Revised NAS Policy requires  
(i) the Audit Committee and Chief Financial 
Officer to approve all non-audit services 
undertaken by the external Auditor and  
(ii) that the cost of non-audit services rendered 
by the external Auditor, in any financial year, 
cannot exceed 70% of the total audit fee for that 
year. Please refer to the next section entitled 
‘2017 Audit and non-audit fees’ for details on the 
operation of this policy during the year.
Safeguards
Additional safeguards to ensure auditor 
objectivity and independence include:
 – six-monthly reports to the Audit Committee 
from the Auditor analysing the fees for 
non-audit services rendered; and
 – an annual assessment, by the Audit Committee, 
of the Auditor’s objectivity and independence 
in light of all relationships between the 
Company and the audit firm.

Committee Responsibilities) Order 2014 
(the ‘Order’)
The Company confirms that it has complied with 
the Order save that certain engagements for 
non-audit services of a recurring nature which 
the external Auditors were permitted to provide 
were noted and ratified by the Audit Committee 
after they were rendered in breach of the Revised 
NAS Policy. The average value of each such 
engagement was c.$9k which, in the aggregate, 
were worth $52k and, hence, are considered to 
be of a trivial nature and were not considered to 
have had any bearing on the independence of the 
external Auditors. It is the Committee’s intention 
to amend the Revised NAS Policy to include the 
pre-approval of permitted services by the 
external Auditors for specified recurring services 
where the value of each such engagement does 
not individually exceed $15,000 and which will be 
subject to an overall cap of $50,000 in any one 
calendar year.
Internal control and risk management
Whilst the Board has overall responsibility for the 
Group’s system of internal control including risk 
management and for reviewing its effectiveness, 
responsibility for the periodic review of the 
effectiveness of these controls has been delegated 
to the Audit Committee. Notwithstanding this 
delegation of authority, the Board continues to 
monitor the strategic risks to which the Company 
is exposed in the context of a risk appetite that is 
under continuous review. Internal controls are 
managed by the use of formal procedures 
designed to highlight financial, operational, 
environmental and social risks and provide 
appropriate information to the Board enabling  
it to protect effectively the Company’s assets  
and, in turn, maintain shareholder value.
The process used by the Audit Committee to 
assess the effectiveness of risk management and 
internal control systems comprises:
 – reports from the Head of the Internal Audit 
function;
 – reviews of accounting and financial reporting 
processes together with the internal control 
environment at Group level. This involves the 
monitoring of performance and the taking of 
relevant action through the monthly review of 
key performance indicators and, where 
required, the production of revised forecasts. 
The Group has adopted a standard accounting 
manual to be followed by all finance teams, 
which is continually updated to ensure the 
consistent recognition and treatment  
of transactions and production of the 
consolidated financial statements;
 – review of budgets and reporting against 
budgets; and
 – consideration of progress against strategic 
objectives.
The system of internal control is designed to 
manage rather than eliminate the risk of failure 
to achieve business objectives and it must be 
recognised that such a system can only provide 
reasonable and not absolute assurance against 
material misstatement or loss.
Audit Committee’s assessment
Based on its review of the process, the  
Audit Committee is satisfied that the internal 
controls are in place at the operational level 
within the Group.
Board’s assessment
Risk management
Throughout the year, the Board considered its 
risk appetite which was considered to be 
appropriate. The Board confirms that its 
assessment of the principal risks facing the 
Company, including those that would threaten its 
business model, future performance, solvency or 
liquidity, and which are set out in the Risk 
Management & Viability section, was robust.
Internal control
As detailed above, the Board, through the 
delegated authority granted to the Audit 
Committee, monitors the ongoing process by 
which critical risks to the business are identified, 
evaluated and managed. This process is consistent 
with the FRC’s ‘Guidance on Risk Management, 
Internal Control and Related Financial and 
Business Reporting’ published in 2014.
The Directors confirm that, with the support of 
the Audit Committee, the effectiveness of the 
Company’s system of risk management and 
internal controls has been reviewed during the 
year under review. These covered material 
controls, which included controls covering 
operational, financial and compliance matters.  
The controls operated effectively during the 
financial year although, as is the case for many 
large companies, additional controls were 
implemented or further strengthened during  
the year. The Audit Committee was made  
aware of the control changes and there was  
no significant impact on the financial results.  
The Directors confirm that no significant failings 
or weaknesses were identified as a result of the 
review of the effectiveness of the Group’s system 
of internal control.
Corporate Governance Report continued
Annual Report & Accounts 2017 
Hochschild Mining plc 62  In 2017 the Nominations Committee 
focused on continuity in terms of the 
Board’s committees and executive 
succession planning.”
The Nominations Committee’s focus on 
succession saw it play an active role during 
2017 on two fronts: firstly in ensuring the 
continuity of the Board Committees in light 
of the retirements during the year, and 
secondly, by reviewing the succession plan 
for the Group’s most senior executives. This 
detailed exercise provided Committee 
members with visibility of the rising talent of 
executives at Hochschild Mining.
In terms of additions to the Board, I am 
delighted to welcome Dionisio Romero 
Paoletti as a Non-Executive Director who 
joins as a representative director of Pelham 
Investment Corporation, the entity through 
which I hold my majority shareholding in the 
 – the proposed nomination of Mr Dionisio 
Romero Paoletti as a nominee director of the 
Group’s major shareholder (controlled by 
Eduardo Hochschild); 
 – the format of the 2017 Board evaluation 
process. As explained earlier in this report,  
it was decided that in light of the extensive 
benefits that have been brought about by past 
internally led-evaluations and the ongoing 
focus on cost-control, the Board favoured the 
continuation of this approach in 2017. The 
format of the 2018 Board evaluation will, 
however, be kept under review; 
 – the findings of the 2017 Board evaluation 
process (see earlier section of the Corporate 
Governance Report); and
 – the nomination of Michael Rawlinson as the 
Senior Independent Director to succeed Enrico 
Bombieri following his retirement from the 
Board at the end of 2017.
Appointments to the Board 
In seeking candidates for appointment to the 
Board, regard is given to relevant experience and 
the skills required to complete the composition  
of a balanced Board, taking into account the 
challenges and opportunities facing the Company.
Mr Romero Paoletti is an acquaintance of  
Mr Eduardo Hochschild and therefore, in relation 
to his appointment as a nominee of the 
Company’s major shareholder pursuant to  
its rights under the Relationship Agreement, 
neither search consultants nor open advertising 
were used.
Diversity policy 
The Board acknowledges that diversity brings 
new perspectives which can drive superior 
business performance and promote innovation. 
However, as has been stated in past Annual 
Reports, the Board is keen to commit to the 
overriding principle that every Board member 
and potential appointee must be able to 
demonstrate the skills and knowledge to be able 
to make a valued contribution to the Board. This 
merits-based approach will continue to apply and 
the Board does not intend to set diversity 
targets. As demonstrated by the most recent 
appointments, where the opportunity also arises 
to increase Board diversity (whether of gender, 
culture or professional background) this would 
be considered to be an additional benefit.

2017 represented a year of many 
achievements on our sustainability agenda, 
but it was also a year of setback in terms of 
our safety record. After three consecutive 
years of zero fatalities, it is with great sadness 
that two accidents across our operations 
during 2017 resulted in four fatalities. The 
Committee and, indeed the Board as a whole, 
are deeply committed to ensuring the safety 
of our colleagues and we are working to 
ensure that safety comes first for everyone 
through the implementation of a Safety 
Culture T ransformation Plan.
With regards to the environment, the Group 
has implemented numerous initiatives to 
mitigate the impact of our operations.

Share capital
Issued share capital
The issued share capital of the Company as at 1 
January 2017 was 507,232,310 ordinary shares 
of 25 pence each (‘shares’). No shares were 
issued during the year.
The Hochschild Mining Employee Share T rust 
(‘the T rust’) is an employee share trust 
established to hold shares on trust for the 
benefit of employees within the Group.
The T rustee of the T rust has absolute discretion to 
vote or abstain from voting in relation to the 
shares held by it from time to time and in doing so 
may take into account the interests of current and 
future beneficiaries and other considerations.
Substantial shareholdings
As at 31 December 2017, the Company had been 
notified of the following interests in the 
Company’s shares in accordance with Chapter 5 
of the Financial Conduct Authority’s Disclosure 
Guidance and T ransparency Rules:
Current share repurchase authority
The Company obtained shareholder approval at 
the AGM held in May 2017 for the repurchase of 
up to 50,723,231 shares which represented, at 
that time, 10% of the Company’s issued share 
capital (‘the 2017 Authority’). Whilst no 
purchases have been made by the Company 
pursuant to the 2017 Authority, it is intended 
that shareholder consent will be sought on 
similar terms at this year’s AGM when the 2017 
Authority expires.
Additional share capital information
This section provides additional information as at 
31 December 2017.
(a) Structure of share capital
The Company has a single class of share capital 
which is divided into ordinary shares of 25 pence 
each, which are in registered form. 
Further information on the Company’s share 
capital is provided in note 27 to the consolidated 
financial statements.
(b) Rights and obligations attaching to shares
The rights attaching to the ordinary shares are 
described in full in the Articles.
In summary, on a show of hands and on a poll at 
a general meeting or class meeting, every 
member present in person or, subject to the 
below, by proxy has one vote for every ordinary 
share held. However, in the case of a vote on a 
show of hands, where a proxy has been 
appointed by more than one member, the proxy 
has one vote for and one vote against if the proxy 
has been instructed by one or more members to 
vote for the resolution and by one or more 
members to vote against the resolution.
Members are entitled to appoint a proxy to 
exercise all or any of their rights to attend and to 
speak and vote on their behalf at a general 
meeting or class meeting. A member that is a 
corporation is entitled to appoint more than one 
individual to act on its behalf at a general meeting 
or class meetings as a corporate representative.
(c) Transfer of shares
The relevant provisions of the Articles state that:
 – registration of a transfer of an uncertificated 
share may be refused in the circumstances set 
out in the CREST Regulations and where, in the 
case of a transfer to joint holders, the number 
of joint holders to whom the uncertificated 
share is to be transferred exceeds four;
 – the Directors may, in their absolute discretion, 
decline to register any transfer of any share 
which is not a fully paid share. The Directors 
may also decline to recognise any instrument 
of transfer relating to a certificated share 
unless the instrument of transfer:
 (i)   is duly stamped (if required) and is 
accompanied by the relevant share 
certificate(s) and such other evidence of 
the right to transfer as the Directors may 
reasonably require; and 
 (ii)  is in respect of only one class of share. 
The Directors may, in their absolute 
discretion, refuse to register a transfer if it 
is in favour of more than four persons 
jointly; and
 – the Directors may decline to register a transfer 
of any of the Company’s shares by a person 
with a 0.25% interest, if such a person has been 
served with a notice under the Companies Act 
after failure to provide the Company with 
information concerning interests in those 
shares required to be provided under the 
Companies Act.

Further information (d) Restrictions on voting
No member shall be entitled to vote at any 
general meeting or class meeting in respect of 
any shares held by him or her, if any call or other 
sum then payable by him or her in respect of that 
share remains unpaid. Currently, all issued shares 
are fully paid.
In addition, no member shall be entitled to vote if 
he or she failed to provide the Company with 
information concerning interests in those shares 
required to be provided under the Companies Act.
(e) Deadlines for voting rights
Votes are exercisable at the general meeting of 
the Company in respect of which the business 
being voted upon is being heard.
Votes may be exercised in person, by proxy or,  
in relation to corporate members, by a  
corporate representative. Under the Articles,  
the deadline for delivering proxy forms cannot 
be earlier than 48 hours (excluding non-working 
days) before the meeting for which the proxy is 
being appointed.
Shareholder agreements
The Relationship Agreement entered into prior 
to the IPO between, amongst others, the Major 
Shareholder (as defined in the Relationship 
Agreement) and Eduardo Hochschild 
(collectively ‘the Controlling Shareholders’)  
and the Company:
 – contains provisions restricting the Controlling 
Shareholders’ rights to exercise their voting 
rights to procure an amendment to the Articles 
that would be inconsistent with the 
Relationship Agreement; and
 – contains an undertaking by the Controlling 
Shareholders that they will, and will procure 
that their Associates will, abstain from voting 
on any resolution to approve a transaction with 
a related party (as defined in the FCA Listing 
Rules) involving the Controlling Shareholders 
or their Associates.
Significant agreements
A change of control of the Company following a 
takeover bid may cause a number of agreements 
to which the Company, or any of its trading 
subsidiaries, is party to take effect, alter or 
terminate. Such agreements include commercial 
trading contracts, joint venture agreements and 
financing arrangements. Further details are given 
below of those arrangements where the impact 
may be considered to be significant in the 
context of the Group.
(a) $350m 7.75% Senior Notes
Under the terms and conditions of the $350 
million 7.75% Senior Notes due 2021 (which, 
although in issue as at the balance sheet date, 
were subsequently redeemed earlier this year), 
upon the occurrence of a change of control 
followed by a ratings downgrade which results in 
a change of control repurchase event (as 
defined in the indenture), the Company may be 
required by each holder of the notes to offer to 
purchase the notes at a price equal to 101% of 
the principal amount of the notes, plus accrued 
and unpaid interest and additional amounts, if 
any, to the purchase date. 
In summary, a Change of Control means the 
occurrence of one or more of the following 
events: (1) the disposition (other than by way 
of merger or consolidation) of all or substantially 
all of the assets of the Company and its 
subsidiaries taken as a whole to any person other 
than (i) to the Company or one of its 
subsidiaries or (ii) to a Permitted Holder (being 
Eduardo Hochschild or a permitted transferee); 
(2) the consummation of any transaction 
(including any merger or consolidation) the 
result of which is that (i) any person other than 
a Permitted Holder becomes the ‘beneficial 
owner’ of more than 50% of the Company’s 
outstanding Voting Stock (as defined) or (ii) the 
Permitted Holders cease to be the beneficial 
owners, directly or indirectly, of at least a 
majority of the outstanding Voting Stock of the 
Company; (3) the Company consolidates with, 
or merges with or into any person, or any person 
consolidates with, or merges with or into, the 
Company, in any such event pursuant to a 
transaction in which any of the outstanding 
Voting Stock of the Company or such other 
person is converted into or exchanged for cash, 
securities or other property, other than any such 
transaction where the shares of the Voting Stock 
of the Company outstanding immediately prior 
to such transaction constitute, or are converted 
into or exchanged for, a majority of the Voting 
Stock of the surviving person immediately after 
giving effect to such transaction; (4) the first 
day on which the majority of the members of the 
Board of Directors of the Company cease to be 
Continuing Directors (as defined); (5) the 
Company shall for any reason cease to be the 
beneficial owner (as defined) of 100% of the 
Voting Stock of Compañía Minera Ares S.A.C.;  
or (6) the adoption of a plan relating to the 
liquidation or dissolution of Compañía Minera 
Ares S.A.C. 
(b) $100m Credit Agreement 
Under the terms and conditions of the $100 
million Credit and Guaranty Agreement between, 
amongst others, the Group and Scotiabank Peru 
S.A.A, a Change of Control obliges the Group to 
prepay all Advances (as defined in the 
agreement) unless any Lender notifies the 
Group that it is declining any such prepayment in 
which case the Advances owing to such declining 
Lender shall not be prepaid. 
In summary, a Change of Control means an event 
or series of events by which: (a) the Permitted 
Holders (being Eduardo Hochschild, his spouse, 
either of their descendants or estate or guardian 
of any of the aforementioned, a trust for the 
benefit of one or more of the aforementioned or 
any entity controlled by any one or more of the 
aforementioned or investment vehicle for the 
primary benefit of any of them) shall for any 
reason cease, individually or in the aggregate, to 
control the Company; or (b) the Permitted 
Holders shall for any reason cease, individually or 
in the aggregate, to have the power to appoint at 
least a majority of the members of the Board of 
Directors or other equivalent governing body of 
the Company; or (c) the Company shall for any 
reason cease, directly or through one or more  
of its Subsidiaries, to be the ‘beneficial owner’  
as so defined) of more than 50% of the Equity 
Interests in Compania Minera Ares S.A.C.
(c) Long-Term Incentive Plans
Awards made under the Group’s Long-T erm 
Incentive Plan, Enhanced Long-T erm Incentive 
Plan and Restricted Share Plan shall, upon a 
change of control of the Company, vest early 
unless a replacement award is made. Vesting will 
be pro-rated to take account of the proportion 
of the period from the award date to the normal 
vesting date falling prior to the change of control 
and the extent to which performance conditions 
(and any other conditions) applying to the 
award have been met.

The Directors may from time to time appoint 
one or more of their body to be the holder of 
any executive office for such period (subject to 
the Companies Act) and on such terms as they 
may determine and may revoke or terminate any 
such appointment.
Each Director is subject to periodic re-election 
by shareholders at intervals of no more than 
every three years. Each Director (other than the 
Chairman and any Director holding executive 
office) shall retire at each AGM following the 
ninth anniversary of the date on which he was 
elected by the Company.
Approach to appointment adopted 
by the Board
Under law, the Company is entitled to adopt 
such practices which are no less stringent than 
those set out in the Articles. Accordingly, 
notwithstanding the above, the Board has 
adopted the recommendation of the UK 
Corporate Governance Code that all Directors 
should seek annual re-election by shareholders.
2014 Listing Rules
Following the implementation, in 2014, of new 
Listing Rules by the Financial Conduct Authority 
(in its capacity as the UK Listing Authority), as a 
company with a controlling shareholder, the 
election or re-election of any Independent 
Director must be approved by: (i) all 
shareholders of the Company; and (ii) the 
independent shareholders of the Company  
(i.e. any person entitled to vote on the election  
of Directors of the Company that is not a 
controlling shareholder).
If either shareholder resolution to elect or 
re-elect the Independent Director is defeated, 
the Company may propose a further resolution 
to elect or re-elect the proposed Independent 
Director provided that the further resolution 
must not be voted on within 90 days from the 
date of the original vote but it must then be 
voted on within a period of 30 days from the end 
of the 90 day period. It may then be passed by a 
simple majority of the shareholders of the 
Company voting as a single class.
Removal of Directors
The Company may, in accordance with and subject 
to the provisions of the Companies Act by ordinary 
resolution of which special notice has been given, 
remove any Director before the expiration of his 
term of office. The office of Director shall be 
vacated if: (i) he is prohibited by law from acting 
as a Director; (ii) he resigns or offers to resign and 
the Directors resolve to accept such offer; (iii) he 
becomes bankrupt or compounds with his 
creditors generally; (iv) a relevant order has been 
made by any court on the grounds of mental 
disorder; (v) he is absent without permission of 
the Directors from meetings of the Board for six 
months and the Directors resolve that his office be 
vacated; (vi) his resignation is requested in writing 
by not less than three quarters of the Directors for 
the time being; or (vii) in the case of a Director 
other than the Chairman and any Director holding 
an executive office, if the Directors shall resolve to 
require him to resign and within 30 days of being 
given notice of such notice he so fails to do.
Relationship Agreement
In addition, under the terms of the Relationship 
Agreement:
 – for as long as the Major Shareholder has an 
interest of 30% or more in the Company, it is 
entitled to appoint up to two Non-Executive 
Directors and to remove such Directors so 
appointed; and
 – for as long as the Major Shareholder has an 
interest of 15% or more of the Company, it is 
entitled to appoint up to one Non-Executive 
Director and to remove such Director so 
appointed.
Amendment of Articles of Association
Any amendments to the Articles may be made in 
accordance with the provisions of the 
Companies Act by way of special resolution.
Powers of the Directors
Subject to the Articles, the Companies Act and 
any directions given by special resolution, the 
business and affairs of the Company shall be 
managed by the Directors who may exercise all 
such powers of the Company.
Subject to applicable statutes and other 
shareholders’ rights, shares may be issued with 
such rights or restrictions as the Company may by 
ordinary resolution decide or, in the absence of 
any such resolution, as the Directors may decide. 
Subject to applicable statutes and any ordinary 
resolution of the Company, all unissued shares of 
the Company are at the disposal of the Directors. 
At each AGM, the Company puts in place annual 
shareholder authority seeking shareholder 
consent to allot unissued shares, in certain 
circumstances for cash, in accordance with the 
guidelines of the Investor Protection Committee.
Repurchase of shares
Subject to authorisation by shareholder 
resolution, the Company may purchase its own 
shares in accordance with the Companies Act. 
Any shares which have been bought back may be 
held as treasury shares or, if not so held, must be 
cancelled immediately upon completion of the 
purchase, thereby reducing the amount of the 
Company’s issued share capital. The minimum 
price which must be paid for such shares is 
specified in the relevant shareholder resolution.
Dividends and distributions
Subject to the provisions of the Companies Act, 
the Company may by ordinary resolution from 
time to time declare dividends not exceeding the 
amount recommended by the Directors. The 
Directors may pay interim dividends whenever 
the financial position of the Company, in the 
opinion of the Directors, justifies their payment. 
If the Directors act in good faith, they are not 
liable to holders of shares with preferred or pari 
passu rights for losses arising from the payment 
of interim dividends on other shares.

Further information Dear Shareholders
On behalf of the Board, I am pleased to present the Directors’ 
Remuneration Report for the year ending 31 December 2017 which is split 
into three sections: this Annual Statement, the Directors’ Remuneration 
Policy and the Annual Report on Remuneration. 
From an operational perspective, 2017 was a successful year for the 
Company, with a record level of production overall and two of our mines, 
Inmaculada and our San Jose joint venture, having their best years to date. 
Our brownfield exploration programme has made good progress with, in 
particular, some encouraging new discoveries in the vicinity of the 
Inmaculada mine. 
It is with sadness, however, that the year also represented a setback in 
terms of our safety record and, after investigation, it is clear that we must 
continue to embed a safety-first culture across all of our operations. More 
details on the programme that is being implemented can be found in the 
Safety section of the Sustainability Report.
Remuneration Policy review
This year we are seeking shareholder approval for a revised Directors’ 
Remuneration Policy which appears on pages 71 to 76 and is the 
culmination of a wide-ranging review by the Remuneration Committee that 
took in all elements of executive remuneration at Hochschild Mining. The 
focus has been on incorporating features of good practice in light of 
specific investor feedback, as well as to reflect general trends in executive 
remuneration through, among other things, reaction to the work of the 
Executive Remuneration Working Group in its mission to simplify executive 
remuneration among the UK’s larger companies. 
I am pleased to be able to report on the resultant proposals which, subject 
to shareholder approval, will take effect from the forthcoming AGM. In 
particular, the new Remuneration Policy will extend the time horizon of the 
Long-T erm Incentive Plan (‘L TIP’) such that the cash awards, upon vesting 
after three years, will be invested as to 50% in the Company’s shares and 
will be required to be held for a further two years. In addition, we have 
reviewed the structure of the annual bonus scheme and, as a result, the 
level of payouts at the ‘threshold’ and ‘target’ levels of performance have 
been reduced thereby further incentivising the highest levels of 
performance. We have also increased the minimum shareholding 
requirement for Executive Directors from 200% to 250% of salary and, in 
recognition of prevailing best practice and the investor focus in this area, 
we have widened the scope of the Group’s malus policy such that a wider 
variety of acts (or failure to act) may be brought within the Remuneration 
Committee’s discretion to reduce incentive payouts.
The new Policy will be put to a binding shareholder vote at the forthcoming 
AGM, and the Annual Report on Remuneration will, as usual, be subject to 
an advisory vote by shareholders.
Remuneration decisions in 2017
For 2017, the CEO will receive an annual bonus of 125% of salary 
(equivalent to 83% of maximum). This bonus outcome reflects the 
Company’s strong operational performance as set out above and, as 
explained later in this report, takes into account the Group’s safety 
performance. A summary of performance against the bonus scorecard 
is included on page 80.
During 2017, the CEO was granted a Long-T erm Incentive Plan award of 
200% of salary. Vesting will be based on performance over the three 
financial years to 31 December 2019. Consistent with our approach for 
2016 awards, 2017 awards will vest to the extent that relative TSR targets 
are achieved over the period. 
Based on relative TSR performance to 31 December 2017, 100% of the 
2015 L TIP award and 86.3% of the four-year tranche of the legacy 2014 
This report has been prepared according to the requirements of the 
Companies Act 2006 (‘the Act’), Regulation 11 and Schedule 8 of 
the Large and Medium-Sized Companies and Groups (Accounts and 
Reports) (Amendment) Regulations 2013 and other relevant 
requirements of the FCA Listing Rules. In addition, the Board has 
applied the principles of good corporate governance set out in the 
UK Corporate Governance Code, and has considered the guidelines 
issued by its leading shareholders and bodies such as ISS 
(Institutional Shareholder Services), the Investment Association and 
the Pensions and Lifetime Savings Association.
The Remuneration Committee is seeking shareholder approval for 
an updated Remuneration Policy at the 2018 AGM. The key changes 
to the previous Policy are as follows:
 – The overall L TIP time horizon to be extended such that 50% of 
vested L TIP awards is paid immediately on vesting in cash (less 
tax), and 50% (after tax) is invested in Company shares and 
required to be held for a further two years
 – Payout under the annual bonus for ‘threshold’ and ‘target’ 
performance to be reduced to up to 50% and up to 75% of 
maximum opportunity, respectively 
 – Use of the discretion granted under Listing Rule 9.4.2R to be 
limited to the maxima set out in the Policy T able (unless in relation 
to a buy-out), and limited to recruitment
 – Widening of the malus policy to include a more extensive list of 
trigger events
 – Clarification of the operation of Compensation for Time Services 
(‘CTS’), as mandated by the Peruvian government
The Committee is also seeking shareholder approval for a new 
Long-T erm Incentive Plan at the AGM, as the 2008 L TIP is due to 
expire in May 2018. The terms of the proposed L TIP are broadly 
consistent with those of the 2008 Plan. No other material changes 
to the Remuneration Policy are proposed at this time, though the 
wording of the Policy has been reviewed to ensure consistency with 
the relevant Plan Rules and clarity of its application. Subject to 
shareholder approval, the new Policy will become effective from  
the date of the 2018 AGM.
Directors’ Remuneration Report
Enhanced Long-T erm Incentive Plan (‘EL TIP’) award will vest in early 2018. 
The high levels of vesting reflect the Company’s strong long-term TSR 
performance over the three- and four-year periods to 2017.
Implementation of proposed Remuneration Policy in 2018
For 2018, the maximum annual bonus opportunity will remain 150% of 
salary. The bonus payment will be subject to performance against broadly 
the same measures as those used in 2017. An L TIP award of 200% of salary 
is proposed for 2018, in line with past years and while vesting will continue 
to be based on relative TSR to the mining sector, the L TIP time horizon will 
be extended as described above. Further detail on the implementation of 
Policy for 2018 is included on page 82.
I trust that shareholders will be supportive of the proposed changes to 
Remuneration Policy, and if you should have any queries or comments on 
the Policy or any aspect of this year’s report, I would encourage you to 
contact me through the Company Secretary.
I hope you find this report to be informative.

Annual Report & Accounts 2017 
Hochschild Mining plc 70 Policy Table
The table below provides a summary of each element of the Remuneration Policy for Executive Directors.
Element: objective  
and link to strategy Operation Opportunity Performance metrics
Base salary
T o support recruitment 
and retention
Salary is reviewed annually, usually in 
March, or following a significant 
change in responsibilities.
Salary levels are targeted to be 
competitive and relevant to the global 
mining sector, with reference to the 
relative cost of living. The Committee 
also takes into consideration general 
pay levels for the wider employee 
population.
T o avoid setting expectations, there is no 
prescribed maximum salary.
In respect of existing Executive Directors, it is 
anticipated that salary increases will generally 
be in line with the wider employee population. 
In exceptional circumstances (including, but 
not limited to, a material increase in job size  
or complexity, the reversal of a previous salary 
reduction, or if a Director has not received  
an increase for a number of years), the 
Committee has discretion to make 
appropriate adjustments to salary levels.
None.
Executive Directors receive 
Compensation for Time Services 
(‘CTS’) and profit share, both of 
which are provided for by Peruvian 
law, as well as certain allowances 
which may include medical insurance, 
the use of a car and driver, and 
personal security.
CTS is a legal entitlement for employees in 
Peru which provides for a fund in the event of 
termination of employment. CTS in respect of 
base salary is calculated as one month’s wages 
and is deposited biannually in an employee’s 
interest-accruing bank account and prior to 
the end of employment, employees can gain 
access to the deposited amount to the extent 
it exceeds four months’ wages. CTS in respect 
of other forms of remuneration such as 
incentive payouts, that are considered to be 
‘non-extraordinary’, is currently calculated at a 
rate of 1/24th.
For the profit share, an amount equal to 8% of 
the relevant Peruvian company’s taxable income 
for the year is distributable to its employees. 
This amount is mandated by Peruvian law, and 
any increases are not within the control of the 
Group. The amount receivable by each 
Executive Director is determined with reference 
to annual base salary (plus the annual bonus, if 
any) and the number of days worked during 
the calendar year.
The value of the other benefits varies by role 
and individual circumstances; eligibility and 
cost are reviewed periodically.
The Committee retains the discretion to 
approve a higher cost of benefits in exceptional 
circumstances (for example relocation) or in 
circumstances where factors outside the 
Company’s control have changed materially 
(for example increases in insurance premiums).
None.
The principal objectives of the Remuneration Committee’s agreed 
Remuneration Policy are to:
 – attract, retain, and motivate the Group’s executives and senior management;
 – provide management incentives that align with and support the Group’s 
business strategy; and
 – align management incentives with the creation of shareholder value.
The Group seeks to achieve this alignment over both the short and long 
term through the use of an annual performance-related bonus, which 
rewards the achievement of a balanced mix of financial, operational and 
other relevant performance measures, and the use of a Long-T erm Incentive 
Plan (‘L TIP’) which is linked to relative T otal Shareholder Return (‘TSR’).
The Committee takes into consideration the remuneration arrangements 
for the wider employee population in making its decisions on remuneration 
for senior executives. Remuneration decisions are also driven by external 
considerations, in particular relating to the global demand for talent in the 
mining sector.
This section of the report sets out the Remuneration Policy for Directors, which 
shareholders are asked to approve at the 2018 AGM. The Committee intends 
that this Policy will formally come into effect from approval at the 2018 AGM.

Annual bonus
T o achieve alignment  
with the Group’s strategy 
and commitment to 
operating responsibly
Performance measures, targets  
and weightings are set at the start  
of the year. At the end of the year,  
the Committee determines the  
extent to which targets have been 
achieved, taking into account 
individual performance.
Bonus payments are normally delivered 
in cash. The Committee has discretion 
to defer all or a portion of the bonus, 
payable in cash or Hochschild shares 
under the Deferred Bonus Plan 
(‘DBP’), for up to three years.
Deferred bonus is subject to malus, 
i.e. forfeiture or reduction, in 
circumstances such as material 
misstatement or gross misconduct.
If deferral is applied, the Committee 
retains the discretion to allow 
dividends (or equivalent) to accrue 
over the deferral period in respect  
of the awards that vest.
The maximum annual bonus opportunity  
is 150% of salary.
For ‘threshold’ and ‘target’ levels of 
performance, the bonus earned is up to 50% 
and up to 75% of maximum, respectively.
Performance is determined by the Committee 
by reference to Group financial measures as  
well as the achievement of personal/strategic 
objectives. The personal/strategic objectives  
are typically weighted no higher than 30%  
of maximum.
The Committee retains discretion to vary 
year-on-year the weightings for individual 
measures, to ensure alignment with the business 
priorities for the year. Performance targets are 
generally calibrated with reference to the 
Company’s budget for the year. Each objective  
in the scorecard has a ‘threshold’, ‘target’ and 
‘maximum’ performance target, achievement of 
which translates into a score for each objective.
The Committee uses its judgement to determine 
the overall scorecard outcome based on the 
achievement of the targets and the Committee’s 
broad assessment of Company and individual 
performance. A review of the quality of earnings 
is conducted by the Committee to determine 
whether any adjustments should be made to  
the reported profit for the purpose of bonus 
outcomes. This ensures that bonus outcomes 
are not impacted by unbudgeted non-recurring 
or one-off items, or circumstances outside of 
management’s control such as material changes 
in commodity prices that could distort the 
overall quality of earnings.
Malus provisions apply, i.e. the Committee has 
the discretion to reduce bonus payments on  
the occurrence of an adverse event that is 
attributable (directly or indirectly) to an act  
or failure to act by the executive. Such events 
include those related to health and safety, the 
environment or community relations.
Details of the measures, weightings and targets 
applicable for the financial year under review 
are provided in the Annual Report on 
Remuneration, unless they are considered  
to be commercially sensitive.
Long-Term Incentive 
Plan (‘LTIP’)
T o directly incentivise 
sustained shareholder  
value creation through 
operational performance 
and to support the 
recruitment of senior 
positions and longer-term 
retention
Awards are made annually, in the  
form of cash, with vesting subject  
to the attainment of specific 
performance conditions and 
continued employment.
Awards have a performance and 
vesting period of at least three years. 
For LTIP awards made in 2018 and 
subsequent years, 50% of vested 
awards is paid immediately on vesting 
in cash (less tax), and 50% after tax  
is invested in Company shares and 
normally required to be held for a 
further two years. Dividends, if any, 
will accrue to shares during the 
holding period.
Maximum annual award level is 200% of salary 
(267% of salary in exceptional circumstances, 
such as to aid the recruitment or retention of 
an Executive Director).
The current performance condition is TSR 
performance relative to specific sector-based 
comparator groups, although the Committee  
has the discretion to adjust the performance 
measures and/or comparator groups before each 
cycle to ensure that they remain appropriate.
Malus provisions apply, i.e. the Committee  
can reduce or prevent vesting if it determines 
either that (i) the overall underlying business 
performance of the Company is not satisfactory 
or (ii) an act or failure to act, which is 
attributable (directly or indirectly) to an 
award-holder has resulted in, among other 
things, an adverse event related to health and 
safety, the environment or community relations.
Details of the TSR comparator groups and 
targets used for specific LTIP grants are included 
in the Annual Report on Remuneration.
In addition to the above elements of remuneration, the Committee may consider it appropriate to grant an award under a different structure, but within 
the limits sets out in the Policy T able, in order to facilitate the recruitment of an individual, exercising the discretion available under Listing Rule 9.4.2R.
The Committee also retains discretion to make non-significant changes to the Policy without going back to shareholders. The Committee is satisfied that 
the Remuneration Policy is in the best interests of shareholders and does not promote excessive risk-taking.
Annual Report & Accounts 2017 
Hochschild Mining plc 72 Notes to the Policy Table
Payments from existing awards
Executive Directors are eligible to receive payment from any award made prior to the approval and implementation of the Remuneration Policy detailed in 
this report (such as the vesting of Enhanced Long-T erm Incentive Plan or Restricted Share Plan (‘RSP’) awards made under a previous Policy, or awards 
made prior to appointment to the Board). Details of any such payments will be set out in the Annual Report on Remuneration as they arise.
Performance measurement selection and approach to target-setting
The measures used under the annual bonus are selected annually to reflect the Group’s main strategic objectives for the year and reflect both financial and 
non-financial priorities.
Performance targets are set to be stretching and achievable, taking into account the Company’s strategic priorities and the economic environment in which 
the Company operates. T argets are set taking into account a range of reference points including the Group’s strategic and operating plan.
The Committee considers relative TSR to be the most appropriate measure of long-term performance for the Company and together with the annual 
bonus measures, provide a balance between absolute and relative performance, between short-term and long-term performance measures, and between 
external and internal measures of performance. TSR aligns with the Company’s focus on shareholder value creation and rewards management for 
outperformance of sector peers, and is transparent, visible and motivational to executives.
The Committee has discretion to vary the performance condition for in-flight awards in certain circumstances to ensure they continue to be fair, 
reasonable and no more or less difficult to satisfy than originally intended. For example, in the event of corporate activity amongst the TSR comparator 
group during a performance period, the Committee may make adjustments to the comparator group (for example, replacing that company with the 
acquiring company, including a substitute for that company, or tracking the future performance of that company by reference to the median of the 
remaining comparators). Other examples of special circumstances include but are not limited to rights issues, corporate restructuring, and special 
dividends. The Committee will also review the appropriateness of the performance conditions prior to each L TIP grant and reserves the discretion to set 
different targets for future awards without consulting with shareholders.
Remuneration Policy for other employees
The Committee takes into consideration the remuneration arrangements for the wider employee population in making its decisions on remuneration for 
senior executives. The Company’s approach to annual salary reviews is consistent across the Group, with consideration given to the scope of the role, level 
of experience, responsibility, individual performance and pay levels in comparable companies.
In general, the Remuneration Policy and principles which apply to other senior executives are broadly consistent with those set out in this report for the CEO. 
Generally, remuneration is linked to Company and individual performance in a way that is ultimately aimed at reinforcing the delivery of shareholder value.
Senior employees above a specific grade are eligible to participate in an annual bonus scheme with a similar design to that for the CEO. Opportunities and 
specific performance conditions vary by organisational level with business area-specific metrics incorporated where appropriate.
All Peruvian employees participate in the statutory profit share scheme whereby an amount equal to 8% of the relevant Peruvian company’s taxable income 
for the year is distributable to its employees. The amount receivable by each employee is determined with reference to their annual base salary and bonus, 
if any, and the number of days worked in the calendar year.
Selected senior employees participate in the L TIP and are required, subject to shareholder approval of the new plan, to invest 50% of the vested cash 
award (on a tax net basis) in the Company’s shares and hold these shares for a further two years. These shares will count towards their target shareholding 
(expressed as a percentage of salary, which will be set depending on seniority).

Pay scenario charts
The charts below provide an estimate of the potential future reward opportunities for the CEO, and the potential split between the different elements  
of remuneration under three different performance scenarios: ‘minimum’, ‘on-target’ and ‘maximum’.
Potential reward opportunities are based on the proposed Remuneration Policy, applied to the CEO’s base salary as at 1 March 2018 of $700,000.
The charts above exclude the effect of any Company share price appreciation.
The ‘minimum’ scenario shows base salary and benefits (that is, fixed remuneration), and associated CTS. These are the only elements of the CEO’s 
remuneration package which are not at risk.
The ‘on-target’ scenario reflects fixed remuneration as above, plus a target payout of 75% of the annual bonus and threshold vesting of 25% of the 
maximum award under the L TIP, and associated CTS.
The ‘maximum’ scenario reflects fixed remuneration, plus full payout of all incentives, and associated CTS.
Approach to remuneration on recruitment or promotion
The Committee’s policy is to set the remuneration package for a new Executive Director in accordance with the approved Remuneration Policy at the time 
of the appointment. The overarching aim is to ensure that the Company pays no more than is necessary to appoint individuals of an appropriate calibre.
In the cases of appointing a new Executive Director, the Committee may make use of any of the existing components of remuneration as set out in the 
Policy T able. In determining the appropriate remuneration for a new Executive Director, the Committee will take into consideration all relevant factors 
(including the nature of remuneration and where the candidate was recruited from) to ensure that arrangements are in the best interests of Hochschild 
and its shareholders. Where an individual is appointed on an initial base salary that is below market, any shortfall may be managed with phased increases 
over a period of time, subject to the individual’s development in the role. This may result in above-average salary increases during this period.
In addition to the components of remuneration as set out in the Policy T able, the Committee may also make an award in respect of a new appointment to 
‘buy-out’ incentive arrangements forfeited on leaving a previous employer on a like-for-like basis, having regard to the fair value of the instruments. In doing 
so, the Committee will consider relevant factors including any performance conditions attached to these awards and the likelihood of those conditions 
being met. The Committee aims to use the current remuneration structure in making recruitment awards, but in some cases it may be required to use the 
flexibility afforded by Listing Rule 9.4.2R, if appropriate, in relation to such buy-out awards.
In cases of appointing a new Executive Director by way of internal promotion, the Committee will determine remuneration in line with the Policy for 
external appointees as detailed above. Where an individual has contractual commitments made prior to his or her promotion to the Board, the Company 
will continue to honour these arrangements. Incentive opportunities for below-Board employees are typically no higher than for Executive Directors, but 
measures may vary to provide better line-of-sight. For more details on the Remuneration Policy for other employees, see page 73.
Service contracts
Executive Director Date of service contract
Ignacio Bustamante 1 April 2007
Executive Director service contracts, including arrangements for early termination, are carefully considered by the Committee.
Ignacio Bustamante was appointed a Director of the Company with effect from 1 April 2010 and is employed under a contract of employment with 
Compañia Minera Ares S.A.C. (Ares) dated 1 April 2007. The contract is subject to Peruvian law and, as such, has no fixed term and may be terminated (i) 
by the executive on 30 days’ notice and (ii) by Ares without notice. Under Peruvian law, termination by Ares other than termination for certain prescribed 
reasons (such as gross negligence) gives rise to an entitlement to compensation of no less than 1.5 times the monthly base salary for each year of service 
completed, up to a maximum of 12 months’ base salary. In addition to these provisions and to reflect Peruvian market practice, the Committee has 
discretion to award Ignacio Bustamante up to an additional 12 months’ base salary on termination (other than for the prescribed reasons outlined above). 
The prevailing circumstances will be taken into consideration at the time of termination.
Annual Report & Accounts 2017 
Hochschild Mining plc 74 Leaver and change-of-control provisions
The table below summarises how the awards under the annual bonus and L TIP, as well as legacy plans, are typically treated in specific circumstances, with 
the final treatment remaining subject to the Committee’s discretion. When considering the appropriate treatment, the Committee reviews all potential 
incentive outcomes to ensure they are fair to both shareholders and participants. Leaver provisions for awards granted prior to 2018 under the EL TIP and 
RSP are detailed in the previous Remuneration Policy.

Non-Executive Directors
The Group’s Non-Executive Directors serve under Letters of Appointment as detailed in the table below. In accordance with their terms, the Non-Executive 
Directors serve for an initial period of three years which is automatically extended for further three-year terms. Notwithstanding this, all Directors are 
subject to annual re-election by the Company in general meeting in line with the UK Corporate Governance Code, and the appointments of Non-Executive 
Directors may be determined by the Board or the Director giving not less than three months’ notice.
Details of the terms of appointment of the Company’s Non-Executive Directors serving during the year are shown in the table below. The appointment and 
reappointment and the remuneration of Non-Executive Directors are matters reserved for the full Board.

The Non-Executive Directors are not eligible to participate in the Company’s performance-related incentive plans and do not receive any pension contributions. 
As part of his change of role from Executive to Non-Executive Chairman on 1 January 2015, the Committee agreed that Mr Hochschild would retain his 
eligibility for benefits received in respect of his time as an Executive Director, consisting primarily of personal security, car and driver, and medical insurance.
The Non-Executive Directors’ fees have been set at a level to reflect the amount of time and level of involvement required in order to carry out their duties 
as members of the Board and its Committees.
Details of the Policy on fees paid to our Non-Executive Directors are set out in the table below:
Objective Details Opportunity Performance metrics
T o attract and retain 
Non-Executive 
Directors of the highest 
calibre with broad 
commercial and other 
experience relevant  
to the Company.
Fee levels are reviewed from time to time, with any 
adjustments typically effective from 1 March each year.
The fee paid to the Chairman is determined by the 
Committee, and base fees to Non-Executive Directors are 
determined by the Board. Additional fees are payable for 
acting as Chairman of the Board’s Committees and  
as Senior Independent Director.
Fee levels are reviewed by reference to FTSE-listed 
companies of similar size and complexity. Time commitment, 
level of involvement required and responsibility are taken into 
account when reviewing fee levels.
NED fees will typically only be increased during the 
term of this Policy in line with general market levels 
of NED fee inflation.
In the event that there is a material misalignment  
with the market or a change in the complexity, 
responsibility or time commitment required to fulfil a 
Non-Executive Director role, the Board has discretion 
to make an appropriate adjustment to the fee level.
The maximum aggregate annual fee for all 
Directors provided in the Company’s Articles  
of Association is £3 million p.a.
None.
In recruiting a new Non-Executive Director (‘NED’), the Committee will use the Policy as set out in the table above. A base fee would be payable for Board 
membership, with additional fees payable for those acting as Chair of the Company’s Board Committees and as Senior Independent Director, as appropriate.
External appointments policy
The Board recognises that Executive Directors may be invited to serve as Directors of other companies, which can bring benefits to the Group. Executive 
Directors are entitled to accept appointments outside the Company providing that the Chairman’s permission is sought and granted. The Policy is that fees 
may be retained by the Director, reflecting the personal risk assumed in such appointments.
Details of external appointments and the associated fees received are included in the Annual Report on Remuneration.
Consideration of conditions elsewhere in the Company
The Committee does not currently consult with employees specifically on the effectiveness and appropriateness of the executive Remuneration Policy and 
framework. However, the Company seeks to promote and maintain good relationships with employee representative bodies as part of its employee 
engagement strategy and consults on matters affecting employees and business performance as required in each case by law and regulation in the jurisdictions 
in which the Company operates. Although the Committee does not consult directly with employees on Directors’ Remuneration Policy, the Committee takes 
into consideration the remuneration arrangements for the wider employee population in making its decisions on remuneration for senior executives.
Consideration of shareholder views
When determining remuneration, the Committee takes into account views of shareholders and best practice guidelines issued by institutional shareholder 
bodies. The Committee will continue to monitor trends and developments in corporate governance and market practice to ensure the structure of the 
executive remuneration remains appropriate.
The Committee is always open to feedback from shareholders on Remuneration Policy and arrangements, and commits to undergoing shareholder 
consultation in advance of any significant changes to Remuneration Policy. Further details on the votes received in respect of remuneration resolutions 
presented at last year’s AGM and any matters discussed with shareholders during the year are provided in the Annual Report on Remuneration.
Annual Report & Accounts 2017 
Hochschild Mining plc 76 The following section provides details of how Hochschild’s 2015 Remuneration Policy was implemented during the financial year ending 31 December 
2017, and how the Remuneration Committee intends to implement the proposed Remuneration Policy in 2018. Any information contained in this section 
of the report that is subject to audit has been marked as such.
Remuneration Committee membership
The Remuneration Committee was chaired during the year under review by Enrico Bombieri, and its other members were Graham Birch and Nigel Moore 
until his retirement from the Board on 11 May 2017. Michael Rawlinson was appointed to the Remuneration Committee on 11 May 2017, and was 
subsequently appointed Chairman of the Committee from 1 January 2018 to succeed Enrico Bombieri. Eileen Kamerick was appointed a member of the 
Committee on that same date. The Remuneration Committee has comprised, at all times, of only Independent Non-Executive Directors. The composition 
of the Remuneration Committee and its terms of reference comply with the provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code and are available for 
inspection on the Company’s website at www.hochschildmining.com.
Members of senior management attend meetings at the invitation of the Committee. During the year, such members included the Chairman, the CEO and the 
Vice President of Human Resources. No Director or senior executive is present when his own remuneration arrangements are considered by the Committee.
The Committee’s terms of reference
The duties of the Remuneration Committee are to determine and agree with the Board the broad policy for the remuneration of the Executive Directors, 
the other members of senior management and the Company Secretary, as well as their specific remuneration packages including pension rights and, where 
applicable, any compensation payments. In determining such policy, the Remuneration Committee shall take into account all factors which it deems 
necessary to ensure that members of the senior executive management of the Group are provided with appropriate incentives to encourage strong 
performance, and are rewarded in a fair and responsible manner for their individual contributions to the success of the Group.
The Remuneration Committee met four times during the year (details of members’ attendance at meetings are provided in the Corporate Governance 
Report on page 65) and undertook the items of business noted below.
Key activities of the Remuneration Committee in 2017:
 – Considered external market developments and best practice in remuneration, and latest shareholder guidelines
 – Reviewed and approved incentive outcomes for 2016 (2016 annual bonus and vesting of 2014 L TIP awards and the third tranche of 2011 EL TIP awards)
 – Reviewed the CEO’s total remuneration, including salary for 2017
 – Considered and approved the 2016 Directors’ Remuneration Report (‘DRR’)
 – Considered investor feedback on the 2016 DRR
 – Approved the opportunity/award level and performance targets for 2017 annual bonus and L TIP awards
 – Reviewed the Remuneration Policy, L TIP and operation of the Annual Bonus Plan
 – Reviewed and widened the malus policy for application across all incentives
 – Considered and approved the CEO’s 2018 objectives
Advisers
During the year, in order to enable the Committee to reach informed decisions on executive remuneration, advice on market data and trends was obtained 
from independent consultants, Mercer Kepler. Mercer Kepler reports directly to the Committee Chairman, and is a signatory to and abides by the Code of 
Conduct for Remuneration Consultants (which can be found at www.remunerationconsultantsgroup.com). Other than advice on remuneration, no other 
services were provided by Mercer Kepler to the Company (or any other part of the MMC group of companies with the exception of unrelated insurance 
brokerage services). The fees paid to Mercer Kepler in respect of work carried out in 2017 (based on time and materials) totalled £44,405, excluding 
expenses and VAT .
The Committee undertakes due diligence periodically to ensure that Mercer Kepler remains independent of the Company and that the advice provided is 
impartial and objective. The Committee is satisfied that the advice provided by Mercer Kepler is independent.

2   Please refer to the Sustainability Report on page 43 for further details on the methodology of calculating the Group’s ECO score (the internally designed measurement of the Company’s environmental performance).
The determination of the bonus payout is at the discretion of the Committee, taking into account performance during the year against the above 
scorecard. Each objective in the scorecard has a ‘threshold’, ‘target’ and ‘maximum’ performance target, achievement of which translates into a score for 
each objective.
Objectives which are considered critical to the Group are given higher weightings, such that outperformance in these areas contributes more significantly 
to the overall bonus outcome. The weighted average of the scores is calculated, and is translated into a bonus outcome of between 0% and 150% of salary 
for the CEO, which is used in the Committee’s judgement in determining the actual bonus awarded.
The Committee assessed performance against the scorecard and the CEO’s performance in 2017. A number of adjustments were made in line with the 
Company’s usual practice to (a) maintain the quality of earnings by primarily disregarding the impact of factors outside of management’s control such as 
the price of silver and gold (as compared to the budgeted prices), the higher provision for vesting of L TIP awards (based on relative T otal Shareholder 
Return), and any budgetary additions approved by the Board, and (b) acknowledge other factors outside of management’s control which, in the context 
of the Brownfields objective, meant the delays by the governmental authorities to process permitting applications for exploration activity. In addition, the 
Committee considered the Group’s safety performance during the year and concluded that the impact on the CEO’s bonus entitlement resulting directly 
from the failure to meet the objective on accident severity represented an appropriate reduction in remuneration. The Committee’s assessment of 
performance resulted in the award of a bonus to the CEO of 125% of salary (83% of maximum).
2015 LTIP vesting
On 18 March 2015, Ignacio Bustamante was granted an award under the L TIP with a face value of US$1,000,000. Vesting was dependent on three-year 
relative TSR performance against both a tailored peer group (70% of the total award) and the constituents of the FTSE350 Mining Index (30% of the total 
award). There was no retesting of performance. Further details of the performance conditions are shown in the table below.

The Company’s TSR in the performance period between 1 January 2015 and 31 December 2017 ranked 86th percentile versus that for the tailored peer 
group and outperformed the median of the constituents of the FTSE350 Mining Index by c.26% per annum. The Committee also considered the overall 
underlying business performance of the Company over the period, and concluded that given the impact on the CEO’s 2017 bonus as a result of the Group’s 
safety performance during the year, there should be no further adjustment to the formulaic vesting outcome in respect of the 2015 L TIP award. Therefore, 
100% of the award will vest on 18 March 2018, subject to continued employment on that date.

On 20 March 2014, Ignacio Bustamante was granted an award of 1,076,122 shares under the 2014 EL TIP (as adjusted for the rights issue in October 
2015). Vesting was dependent on four-, five- and six-year relative TSR performance against a tailored peer group. There was no retesting of performance. 
Further details of the performance conditions are shown in the table below:

The Company’s TSR in the performance period between 1 January 2014 and 31 December 2017 ranked 82nd percentile versus that for the tailored peer 
group. The Committee also considered the overall underlying business performance of the Company over the period, and concluded that given the impact 
on the CEO’s 2017 bonus as a result of the Group’s safety performance during the year, there should be no further adjustment to the formulaic vesting 
outcome in respect of this tranche of the 2014 EL TIP award. Therefore, 86.3% of the award will vest in March 2018, subject to continued employment on 
the vesting date.
Scheme interests awarded in 2017 (audited)
On 8 March 2017, Ignacio Bustamante was granted a cash-settled award under the L TIP with a face value of $1.4 million.
Vesting is dependent on three-year relative TSR from 1 January 2017 to 31 December 2019, with 70% of the award based on TSR performance against a 
tailored peer group and 30% of the award based on TSR performance against the constituents of the FTSE350 Mining Index.
Awards vest on the third anniversary of the date of grant, subject to continued employment, and are subject to potential malus if, before vesting, the 
Committee determines either that (i) the overall underlying business performance of the Company is not satisfactory or (ii) an unacceptable position  
has occurred regarding safety, the environment, community relations, and/or compliance with legal obligations of the Company. Awards are settled in cash 
and the CEO will be required to invest at least 20% of any amount vesting into Hochschild shares, until such time as he has achieved the relevant 
shareholding guideline.

Implementation of Remuneration Policy for 2018
A summary of how the proposed Remuneration Policy will be applied for the year ended 31 December 2018, subject to shareholder approval,  
is provided below.
Salary
The Committee reviewed the CEO’s salary and has determined that it shall remain unchanged at US$700k (excluding CTS).
Annual bonus
The maximum annual bonus opportunity for the CEO for the 2018 financial year will remain 150% of salary. The bonus payment will be subject to 
performance against broadly the same measures as those used in 2017. Further disclosure of measures and targets, where not commercially sensitive,  
will be provided in next year’s Annual Report on Remuneration. As referred to in the Chairman’s Statement and Remuneration Policy, effective from  
the 2018 bonus, payout for ‘threshold’ and ‘target’ performance will be reduced to 50% (from 67%) and to 75% (from 83%) of the maximum 
opportunity, respectively.
As in prior years, the Committee will use its judgement to determine the overall scorecard outcome based on the achievement of the targets and a broad 
assessment of Company and individual performance. The Committee reviewed the Company’s malus policy during the year, and agreed to widen the policy 
to include a more extensive list of trigger events, including but not limited to material misstatement, material failure of risk management, gross misconduct, 
action or omission resulting in serious reputational damage. The revised malus provisions will apply to all incentives, including the annual bonus, effective 
from 2018.
The Remuneration Committee will continue to retain discretion as to whether any part of the bonus should be paid in shares and/or deferred for any 
period up to three years.
LTIP
Subject to shareholder approval, the Committee will make awards in 2018 within the maximum limits described in the proposed Remuneration Policy.  
The performance conditions will be the same as for 2017 awards. The full comparator group is as follows: Acacia Mining, Agnico-Eagle Mines, Alamos Gold, 
AngloGold Ashanti, Barrick Gold, Centamin Egypt, Cia des Minas Buenaventura, Coeur Mining, Eldorado Gold, Endeavour Silver, First Majestic Silver, 
Fortuna Silver Mines, Fresnillo, Gold Fields, Goldcorp, Hecla Mining, IAMGOLD, Kinross Gold, Newmont Mining, Pan American Silver, Petropavlovsk, 
Polymetal, Randgold Resources, Silver Standard Resources, T ahoe Resources, and Volcan Compañía Minera.
As referred to in the Chairman’s Statement and Remuneration Policy, effective from awards made in 2018, the L TIP time horizon will be extended such that 
50% of a vested L TIP award will be paid immediately in cash, with remaining 50% invested (on an after tax basis) in the Company’s shares which are 
required to be held for a further two years.
Revised malus provisions apply to L TIP awards granted in 2018 and subsequent years on the same basis as that described in the annual bonus section.

operates in, and the FTSE250 Index provides a view of performance against a broad equity market index of which Hochschild has been a constituent  
for the majority of the past eight years. The table below details the CEO’s single figure remuneration and actual variable pay outcomes over the

Directors’ interests (audited)
The interests of the Directors and their families in the ordinary shares of the Company as at 31 December 2017 are detailed in the table below.
The Company has adopted shareholding guidelines whereby all Executive Directors (currently only the CEO) are required to acquire and retain a beneficial 
shareholding in the Company equal to at least 200% of base salary. The guideline has been increased to 250% to take effect from the 2018 AGM for 
additional shareholder alignment. The CEO is required to invest 20% of a vested L TIP award (on a net basis) and retain 50% of the after-tax vested EL TIP 
shares until such time as he has met the shareholding guideline. In respect of awards granted under the proposed L TIP in 2018 and future years, the CEO 
will be required to invest 50% of a vested L TIP award (on a net basis) regardless of his achievement of the shareholding guideline.

Further information Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report and the Group and Company financial statements in accordance with applicable law  
and regulations.
Company law requires the Directors to prepare Group and parent company financial statements for each financial year. Under that law the Directors have 
prepared the financial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (‘IFRS’) as adopted by the EU. 
Under company law the Directors must not approve the financial statements unless they are satisfied that they give a true and fair view of the state of 
affairs of the Group and the parent company and of their profit or loss for that period. In preparing those financial statements, the Directors are  
required to:
 – select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently
 – make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and prudent;
 – state whether applicable IFRS have been followed, subject to any material departures disclosed and explained in the financial statements; and
 – prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Company will continue in business.
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain the parent company’s transactions and 
disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the Parent Company and enable them to ensure that its financial statements comply 
with the Companies Act 2006. They have general responsibility for taking such steps as are reasonably open to them to safeguard the assets of the Group 
and to prevent and detect fraud and other irregularities. Under applicable law and regulations the Directors are also responsible for preparing a Strategic 
Report, Directors’ Report, Directors’ remuneration report and Corporate governance statement that comply with that law and those regulations. 
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the corporate and financial information included on the Company’s website. Legislation 
in the UK governing the preparation and dissemination of financial statements may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.

Opinion
In our opinion:
 – Hochschild Mining plc’s Group financial statements and parent company financial statements (the 'financial statements') give a true and fair view of the 
state of the Group’s and of the parent company’s affairs as at 31 December 2017 and of the Group’s profit for the year then ended;
 – the Group financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the 
European Union;
 – the parent company financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union as applied in 
accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006; and
 – the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006, and, as regards the Group financial 
statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation.
We have audited the financial statements of Hochschild Mining plc which comprise:
Group Parent company
Consolidated statement of financial position as at 31 December 2017 Statement of financial position as at 31 December 2017
Consolidated income statement for the year then ended Statement of changes in equity for the year then ended

The financial reporting framework that has been applied in their preparation is applicable law and International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as 
adopted by the European Union and, as regards the parent company financial statements, as applied in accordance with the provisions of the Companies 
Act 2006.
Basis for opinion 
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK) (ISAs (UK)) and applicable law. Our responsibilities under those 
standards are further described in the Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements section of our report below. We are independent 
of the Group and parent company in accordance with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the financial statements in the UK, including 
the FRC’s Ethical Standard as applied to listed public interest entities, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these 
requirements.
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.
Use of our report
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006. Our audit work has 
been undertaken so that we might state to the Company’s members those matters we are required to state to them in an auditor’s report and for no other 
purpose. T o the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the Company and the Company’s 
members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed. 
Conclusions relating to principal risks, going concern and viability statement
We have nothing to report in respect of the following information in the Annual Report, in relation to which the ISAs (UK) require us to report to you 
whether we have anything material to add or draw attention to:
 – the disclosures in the Annual Report set out on page pages 44 to 48 that describe the principal risks and explain how they are being managed or mitigated;
 – the Directors’ confirmation set out on page 62 in the Annual Report that they have carried out a robust assessment of the principal risks facing the entity, 
including those that would threaten its business model, future performance, solvency or liquidity;
 – the Directors’ statement set out on page 54 in the financial statements about whether they considered it appropriate to adopt the going concern basis of 
accounting in preparing them, and their identification of any material uncertainties to the entity’s ability to continue to do so over a period of at least 12 
months from the date of approval of the financial statements;
 – whether the Directors’ statement in relation to going concern required under the Listing Rules in accordance with Listing Rule 9.8.6R (3) is materially 
inconsistent with our knowledge obtained in the audit; or 
 – the Directors’ explanation set out on page 49 in the Annual Report as to how they have assessed the prospects of the entity, over what period they have 
done so and why they consider that period to be appropriate, and their statement as to whether they have a reasonable expectation that the entity will be 
able to continue in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due over the period of their assessment, including any related disclosures drawing 
attention to any necessary qualifications or assumptions.
Overview of our audit approach
Key audit 
matters

Further information Key audit matters 
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement, were of most significance in our audit of the financial statements of the current 
period and include the most significant assessed risks of material misstatement (whether or not due to fraud) that we identified. These matters included 
those which had the greatest effect on: the overall audit strategy, the allocation of resources in the audit; and directing the efforts of the engagement 
team. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in our opinion thereon, and we do not provide 
a separate opinion on these matters.
Risk Our response to the risk
Key observations 
communicated to the 
Audit Committee
Recoverability of the carrying value of the Group’s 
mining assets 
Refer to the Audit Committee Report (page 61); Accounting 
policies (page 99); and note 16 (page 120), 17 and 18 of the 
Consolidated Financial Statements (page 122)
At 31 December 2017 the carrying value of the Group’s mining 
assets were: 
 – Property, plant and equipment: US$895.7m (2016: US$975.5); 
 – Evaluation and exploration assets: US$147.4 (US$139.0); and 
 – Intangible assets: US$24.5m (2016: US$26.4m).
IFRS requires companies to test their non-current assets, by 
cash-generating unit (CGU) or relevant group of CGUs, for 
impairment whenever an indicator exists. 
Additionally, IFRS requires testing the CGUs for impairment 
reversal at the end of each reporting period by assessing whether 
there is any indicator that an impairment loss recognised in prior 
periods (for an asset other than goodwill) may no longer exist, or 
may have decreased. 
For the Group, the appropriate level of CGUs are: 
 – Operating mines: Arcata, Pallancata, Inmaculada and San Jose; 
and 
 – Advanced exploration projects: San Felipe, Volcan, Azuca  
and Crespo.
The Volcan CGU includes an intangible asset with an indefinite 
useful life and therefore is tested for impairment at least annually 
and whenever there is an indication that the asset might be 
impaired.
Indicators of impairment were identified in 2017 with respect  
to the Arcata CGU and indicators of impairment reversals were 
identified with respect to the Pallancata and San Felipe CGUs: 
 – The Arcata mine unit experienced significant decrease in 
production during the year as well as difficulties to replace 
production with the conversion of resources into reserves. 
 – At Pallancata there was an increase in resources and reserves as 
well as in production resulting in an increase in tonnage  
and grades.
 – At San Felipe the significant increase in zinc market prices over 
the year resulted in an increase in the value of the project, 
together with the proceeds received in connection  
to the Group’s option agreement to sell San Felipe.
As consequence of the above indicators, management estimated 
the recoverable amount of these assets which resulted in the 
recognition of an impairment charge of $43.0m in respect of the 
Arcata CGU and impairment reversals of $31.9m and $8.4m in 
respect of Pallancata and San Felipe CGUs, respectively.
There is a risk that the carrying values of the Group’s mining assets 
might not be recoverable or could require additional reversal of 
impairments previously recognised. This risk has increased relative 
to the prior year as a result of the impairments and impairment 
reversals recognised during the year.
Our approach focused on the following procedures:
 – Obtained an understanding of management’s process and  
key controls over impairment of mining assets, and walked 
through the process in order to assess their design 
effectiveness in supporting the prevention, detection or 
correction of material errors in the financial statements
 – Obtained management’s assessment of whether any indicators of 
impairment or reversal of impairment were present during 2017, 
following the requirements of IAS 36 and IFRS 6 
 – We corroborated the validity and completeness of the 
indicators identified by management. For this purpose, we 
considered management’s assessment by reference to our 
knowledge of the business and the following procedures: 
 – We compared and assessed the changes to the spot and 
analyst forecasts of future gold and silver prices between  
31 December 2016 and 31 December 2017
 – We obtained and tested relevant support of management’s 
position on market interest rates and other macro-economic 
factors
 – For all operating mines, we assessed the economic 
performance of the CGUs during the year and identified 
progress against approved mine plans and budgets, taking 
into account updated reserves and resources estimates
 – For exploration projects we obtained an understanding  
of management’s plans to recover the carrying value in  
full from successful development or by sale
 – We obtained the recoverable value models from management 
for all those CGUs requiring a full impairment assessment and 
assessed the appropriateness of the methodology applied in 
preparing the model as well as the arithmetical accuracy of 
management’s model
 – With respect to the recoverable value model for the Arcata and 
Pallancata CGUs, we performed the following procedures: 
 – We challenged the appropriateness of key assumptions  
such as price, production volumes, grades, operating cost and 
capex by comparing to third party/independent sources or 
other evidence and performed sensitivity analyses on 
significant inputs
 – We agreed the main inputs to approved mine plans or 
budgets, and compared them with historical actual figures 
where appropriate
 – We involved our valuation specialists to assist us in  
assessing the appropriateness of the discount rate used  
in the calculation
 – With respect to the recoverable value model for the  
San Felipe and Volcan CGUs, we agreed the main inputs  
used to information from third party/independent sources. 
 – In addition, for the Volcan CGU, we involved our valuation 
specialists to assist us in assessing the appropriateness of the 
methodology applied to determine the carrying value of the 
CGU as well as the key assumption used therein
 – We compared the calculated recoverable value to the 
associated carrying value, assessing whether any impairment 
charges, or reversal of previously recognised impairment 
charges, were necessary
 – Furthermore, we considered the appropriateness, sufficiency, 
and clarity of the impairment-related disclosures provided in 
the financial statements and disclosures of sensitivities
We performed audit procedures at the Group level over this  
risk area covering 100% of the risk amount.
As a result of the audit 
procedures performed, 
we have concluded  
that management’s 
impairment indicator 
analysis and impairment 
assessment for the 
Group’s CGUs has been 
carried out appropriately 
and in accordance with 
the requirements of IFRS. 
We further concluded 
that the significant 
assumptions used in the 
recoverable value models 
prepared by management 
were appropriate, and 
when applicable, fell within 
the range of acceptable 
outcomes. 
Based on the procedures 
performed, we concur 
with management’s 
conclusion to recognise an 
impairment charge and 
impairment reversals on 
the relevant CGUs. 
Furthermore, we concur 
with management’s 
assessment that the 
carrying value of the 
Volcan CGU is neither 
further impaired nor 
requires a reversal  
of impairment as at  
31 December 2017. 
We concluded that 
the related disclosures  
in the Group financial 
statements are 
appropriate.

Statements (page 113)
For the year ended 31 December 2017 the Group recognised 
revenue from operations of US$722.6m (2016: US$688.2m).
The significant number of sales transactions and complex terms 
under which title, risks and rewards pass to the customer 
increases the risk of cut-off errors. We have also identified risks in 
relation to the calculation of the adjustment for provisional 
pricing, including the estimate of silver and gold in the 
concentrate sold. In particular:
 – Cut-off: the complexity of terms that define when title, risk and 
reward are transferred to the customer, as well  
as the high value of the transactions, give rise to the risk that 
revenue is not recognised in the correct period.
 – Measurement: at each reporting period there are a number  
of open invoices that are provisionally priced including the 
estimate of silver and gold in the concentrate sold and the 
forward pricing of those sales. Estimation is used in the 
valuation of the embedded derivative and the income 
statement impact of the mark to market movement which is 
recorded in revenue. This calculation is based on estimations 
and susceptible to potential manipulation
The risk relating to revenue recognition has remained stable  
in comparison to the prior year as no significant changes were 
noted in sales agreements.
Our approach focused on the following procedures:
 – Obtained an understanding of the key controls around the 
revenue recognition process sufficient to assess its design 
effectiveness in supporting the prevention, detection or 
correction of material errors in the reported revenue figures 
 – Tested the operating effectiveness of key controls at one 
component (where this was deemed a more efficient approach 
than substantive testing, after considering the number of sales 
transactions), including those controls over provisional pricing
 – Read the terms and conditions of material sales contracts and 
ensured they have been accounted for in line with the Group's 
revenue recognition policy 
 – Performed detailed substantive testing procedures over the 
revenue transactions. This included: agreeing the main inputs to 
supporting evidence (such as provisional and final invoices, 
credit/debit notes, bill of ladings, market prices, agreements and 
bank statements), recalculating the amounts invoiced and 
recorded as revenue, performing cut-off testing to ensure 
revenue is recognised in the correct period 
 – For open sales where provisional pricing applies, we verified with 
external sources that inputs used were appropriate and 
recalculated the provisional price adjustment to ensure it was 
correctly measured
 – Investigated and understood the nature of any significant 
credits raised post year-end to ensure that transactions  
were recorded at the correct value in the relevant period
 – Tested reconciliation of year-end inventory by agreeing the 
movements of production and sales transactions to the 
respective reports
 – Read and assessed the financial statements disclosures to 
ensure that presentation and all the disclosure requirements in 
respect of revenue and the provisional pricing have  
been included
We performed audit procedures in two components under  
full scope audit, covering 100% of this risk amount.
As a result of the 
procedures performed, 
we concluded that the 
Group has appropriately 
accounted for the revenue 
transactions in 
accordance with IFRS, 
including the appropriate 
determination of the 
provisional pricing 
adjustment. 
Mine rehabilitation provisions
Refer to the Audit Committee Report (page 61); Accounting 
policies (page 99); and note 26 of the Consolidated Financial 
Statements (page 128)
At 31 December 2017 management has recorded a mine 
rehabilitation provision of US$100.1m (2016: US$102.4m). 
Management is required to provide for the costs of 
environmental rehabilitation and site restoration in accordance 
with IAS 37 ‘Provisions, contingent liabilities and contingent 
assets’. 
Given the high level of judgement and estimation in assessing the 
method, timing and quantum of the cash flows required to 
rehabilitate mines, this is an area of audit focus. 
The risk relating to mine rehabilitation provisions has remained 
stable in comparison to the prior year, however as certain mines 
are approaching the end of life, this matter still had a greater 
effect on directing the efforts of the engagement team and 
therefore we consider it as a key audit matter.
Our approach consisted of the following procedures:
 – Obtained an understanding of management’s process to 
estimate the future restoration costs
 – Obtained a detailed understanding of the mine closure reports 
issued by the external specialists engaged by the Group to 
update the mine closure plans, and held discussions directly 
with the specialists, to understand their work and assess the 
sufficiency of the Group’s restoration provisions
 – Assessed the objectiveness and competence of the external and 
internal specialists used by management
 – Understood the main changes or lack of changes in estimates 
and new restoration costs and challenged the rationale behind 
these. For this purpose we held discussions with management 
and the third party specialist as well as performed comparison 
to prior year figures and enquired about significant variances
 – Performed an overall recalculation of the mine rehabilitation 
provision, including assessing the appropriateness of the 
discount rate applied by agreeing the nominal risk free rate 
according to the life of each mine unit to independent sources
 – Assessed the appropriateness of the accounting for the changes 
to these provisions, and ensured that these changes and the 
provisions were appropriately reflected and disclosed in the 
Group financial statements
We performed audit procedures on two full scope components, 
covering 99% of this risk amount.
As a result of the 
procedures performed  
we concluded that the 
provisions for mine 
rehabilitation activities 
have been recognised 
appropriately in 
accordance with IFRS,  
and that all required 
disclosures have been 
included in the Group 
financial statements. 
Based on the information 
available, we consider the 
judgements and 
assumptions made by 
management and the 
external specialists to be 
reasonable.

Financial statements
Further information The key audit matters included in our auditor’s report are consistent with those included in prior year.
As part of our audit, we also addressed the risk of management override of internal controls, including evaluating whether there is evidence of bias by  
the Directors that may represent a risk of material misstatement due to fraud. The above is not a complete list of all risks identified by our audit.
An overview of the scope of our audit 
Tailoring the scope
Our assessment of audit risk, our evaluation of materiality and our allocation of performance materiality determines our audit scope for each entity within 
the Group. T aken together, this enables us to form an opinion on the Consolidated financial statements. We take into account size, risk profile, the 
organisation of the Group and effectiveness of Group-wide controls, changes in the business environment and other factors such as recent internal Audit 
results when assessing the level of work to be performed at each entity. 
In assessing the risk of material misstatement to the Group financial statements, and to ensure we had adequate quantitative coverage of significant 
accounts in the financial statements, of the 18 reporting components of the Group, we selected three components covering entities within the UK,  
Peru and Argentina, which represent the principal business units within the Group.
We performed an audit of the complete financial information for three components ('full scope components') which were selected based on their size  
or risk characteristics. In addition to this, for two components ('specific scope components') we performed audit procedures on specific accounts within 
those components that we considered had the potential for the greatest impact on the significant accounts in the financial statements either because of 
the size of these accounts or their risk profile. 
The reporting components where we performed audit procedures accounted for 97% (2016: 97%) of the Group’s Adjusted EBITDA (on an absolute 
basis), 100% (2016: 100%) of the Group’s Revenue and 96% (2016: 96%) of the Group’s T otal assets. For the current year, the full scope components 
contributed 97% (2016: 97%) of the Group’s Adjusted EBITDA, 100% (2016: 100%) of the Group’s Revenue and 89% (2016: 90%) of the Group’s T otal 
assets. The specific scope components contributed 7% (2016: 6%) of the Group’s T otal assets. The audit scope of these components may not have 
included testing of all significant accounts of the component but will have contributed to the coverage of significant accounts tested for the Group. 
Of the remaining 13 components that together represent 3% of the Group’s Adjusted EBITDA, none are individually greater than 2% of the Group’s 
Adjusted EBITDA. For these components, we performed other procedures, including analytical reviews, testing of consolidation journals and enquiry  
of management about unusual transactions in these components, to respond to any potential risks of material misstatement to the Group financial 
statements.

Involvement with component teams 
In establishing our overall approach to the Group audit, we determined the type of work that needed to be undertaken at each of the components by us, as 
the primary audit engagement team, or by component auditors from other EY global network firms operating under our instruction. Of the three full 
scope components, audit procedures were performed on one of these directly by the primary audit team. For the two specific scope components, the 
primary audit team performed the audit procedures.
The Group audit team continued to follow a programme of planned visits that has been designed to ensure that the Senior Statutory Auditor visits each of 
the primary operating locations where the Group audit scope was focused. During the current year’s audit cycle, visits were undertaken by the primary 
audit team, including the Senior Statutory Auditor, to the component team in Peru and by the Senior Statutory Auditor to the component team in 
Argentina. These visits involved discussing the audit approach with the component team and any issues arising from their work and meetings with local 
management. In addition, the primary team interacted regularly with the component teams where appropriate during various stages of the audit, were 
responsible for the scope and direction of the audit process, attended closing meetings either in person or by call and reviewed key audit working papers 
on risk and other areas. This, together with the additional procedures performed at Group level, gave us appropriate evidence for our opinion on the 
Group financial statements.
Independent auditor’s report to the members of Hochschild Mining plc
continued
Annual Report & Accounts 2017 
Hochschild Mining plc 90 Our application of materiality 
We apply the concept of materiality in planning and performing the audit, in evaluating the effect of identified misstatements on the audit and in forming 
our audit opinion. 
Materiality
The magnitude of an omission or misstatement that, individually or in the aggregate, could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of the 
users of the financial statements. Materiality provides a basis for determining the nature and extent of our audit procedures.
We determined materiality for the Group to be US$6.0 million (2016: US$6.3 million), which is approximately 2% (2016: 2%) of the Group’s Adjusted 
EBITDA. We believe that Adjusted EBITDA provides us with an earnings-based measure that is significant to users of the financial statements on which  
we could set our materiality. This was deemed to be a critical measure for users of the financial statements, given the focus on this metric by the Group’s 
shareholders, investors and external lenders, specifically as an Adjusted EBITDA measure is used to assess the Group’s compliance with key restrictive 
covenants on the Group’s borrowings. 
We determined materiality for the parent company to be US$21.1 million (2016: US$16.4 million), which is 1% (2016: 1%) of Equity. The parent 
company materiality is higher than the Group materiality as it is based on Equity, which we considered to be an appropriate basis for materiality for a 
holding company, as the users of the financial statements focus on a capital-based measured. 
Materiality
–   Profit from continuing operations before exceptional items, net of finance cost, foreign 
exchange loss and income tax
–   Add: Depreciation and amortisation in cost of sales and in administrative expenses 
–   Add: Exploration expenses other than personnel and other exploration related fixed expenses
–  Add: Other non-cash expenses
–  Adjusted EBITDA – US$300.8m
–  Materiality: 2% of Adjusted EBITDA – US$6.0m
Adjustments
Starting basis
Performance materiality
The application of materiality at the individual account or balance level. It is set at an amount to reduce to an appropriately low level the probability that the 
aggregate of uncorrected and undetected misstatements exceeds materiality.
On the basis of our risk assessments, together with our assessment of the Group’s overall control environment, our judgement was that performance 
materiality was 75% (2016: 75%) of our planning materiality, namely US$4.5 million (2016: US$4.7 million). We have set performance materiality at this 
percentage due to our understanding of the Group’s control environment and that there have been no significant events that would alter our expectation 
that there is a low likelihood of misstatements that would be material individually or in aggregate to the financial statements.
Audit work at component locations for the purpose of obtaining audit coverage over significant financial statement accounts is undertaken based on a 
percentage of total performance materiality. The performance materiality set for each component is based on the relative scale and risk of the component 
to the Group as a whole and our assessment of the risk of misstatement at that component. In the current year, the range of performance materiality 
allocated to components was US$2.2 million to US$3.8 million (2016: US$3.0 million to US$3.8 million). 
Reporting threshold
An amount below which identified misstatements are considered as being clearly trivial.
We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to them all uncorrected audit differences in excess of US$300k (2016: US$315k), which is set 
at 5% of planning materiality, as well as differences below that threshold that, in our view, warranted reporting on qualitative grounds. 
We evaluate any uncorrected misstatements against both the quantitative measures of materiality discussed above and in light of other relevant qualitative 
considerations in forming our opinion.

Financial statements
Further information Other information 
The other information comprises the information included in the Annual Report set out on pages 1 to 86, including the Strategic Report and Governance 
sections (including Directors’ Report, Corporate Governance Report, Supplementary Information, Directors’ Remuneration Report and Statement of 
Directors’ Responsibilities), other than the financial statements and our auditor’s report thereon. The Directors are responsible for the other information. 
Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and, except to the extent otherwise explicitly stated in this report, we do not 
express any form of assurance conclusion thereon. 
In connection with our audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other 
information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. 
If we identify such material inconsistencies or apparent material misstatements, we are required to determine whether there is a material misstatement in 
the financial statements or a material misstatement of the other information. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a 
material misstatement of the other information, we are required to report that fact.
We have nothing to report in this regard.
In this context, we also have nothing to report in regard to our responsibility to specifically address the following items in the other information and to 
report as uncorrected material misstatements of the other information where we conclude that those items meet the following conditions:
 – Fair, balanced and understandable set out on page 54 – the statement given by the Directors that they consider the Annual Report and financial 
statements taken as a whole is fair, balanced and understandable and provides the information necessary for shareholders to assess the Group’s 
performance, business model and strategy, is materially inconsistent with our knowledge obtained in the audit; or 
 – Audit Committee reporting set out on pages 59 to 62 – the section describing the work of the Audit Committee does not appropriately address 
matters communicated by us to the Audit Committee; or
 – Directors’ statement of compliance with the UK Corporate Governance Code set out on page 55 – the parts of the Directors’ statement 
required under the Listing Rules relating to the Company’s compliance with the UK Corporate Governance Code containing provisions specified for 
review by the Auditor in accordance with Listing Rule 9.8.10R(2) do not properly disclose a departure from a relevant provision of the UK Corporate 
Governance Code.
Opinions on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006
In our opinion, the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited has been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 2006.
In our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of the audit:
 – the information given in the Strategic Report and the Directors’ Report for the financial year for which the financial statements are prepared is consistent 
with the financial statements; and 
 – the Strategic Report and the Directors’ Report have been prepared in accordance with applicable legal requirements. 
Matters on which we are required to report by exception
In the light of the knowledge and understanding of the Group and the parent company and its environment obtained in the course of the audit, we have 
not identified material misstatements in:
 – the Strategic Report or the Directors’ Report; or
 – the information about internal control and risk management systems in relation to financial reporting processes and about share capital structures, given 
in compliance with rules 7.2.5 and 7.2.6 of the FCA Rules.
We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters in relation to which the Companies Act 2006 requires us to report to you if, in our opinion:
 – adequate accounting records have not been kept by the parent company, or returns adequate for our audit have not been received from branches not 
visited by us; or
 – the parent company financial statements and the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited are not in agreement with the accounting 
records and returns; or
 – certain disclosures of Directors’ remuneration specified by law are not made; or
 – we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit; or
 – a Corporate Governance Statement has not been prepared by the Company.
Responsibilities of Directors
As explained more fully in the Directors’ Responsibilities Statement set out on page 86, the Directors are responsible for the preparation of the financial 
statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view, and for such internal control as the Directors determine is necessary to enable the 
preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. 
In preparing the financial statements, the Directors are responsible for assessing the Group and parent company’s ability to continue as a going concern, 
disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the Directors either intend to liquidate 
the Group or the parent company or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.
Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements 
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to 
fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an 
audit conducted in accordance with ISAs (UK) will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and 
are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the 
basis of these financial statements. 
Independent auditor’s report to the members of Hochschild Mining plc
continued
Annual Report & Accounts 2017 
Hochschild Mining plc 92 Explanation as to what extent the audit was considered capable of detecting irregularities, including fraud 
The objectives of our audit, in respect to fraud, are: to identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements due to fraud; to 
obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the assessed risks of material misstatement due to fraud, through designing and implementing 
appropriate responses; and to respond appropriately to fraud or suspected fraud identified during the audit. However, the primary responsibility for the 
prevention and detection of fraud rests with both those charged with governance of the entity and management. 
Our approach was as follows: 
 – We obtained an understanding of the legal and regulatory frameworks that are applicable to the Group and determined that the most significant which 
are directly relevant to specific assertions in the financial statements are those related to the report framework (IFRS, the Companies Act 2006 and UK 
Corporate Governance Code) and the relevant tax compliance regulations in UK, Peru and Argentina.
 – We understood how Hochschild Mining plc is complying with those legal and regulatory frameworks by making enquiries of management, internal audit, 
those responsible for legal and compliance procedures and the Company Secretary. We corroborated our enquiries through our review of Board minutes 
and papers provided to the Audit Committee.
 – We assessed the susceptibility of the Group’s financial statements to material misstatement, including how fraud might occur by meeting with 
management from various parts of the business to understand where it is considered there was a susceptibility of fraud. We also considered performance 
targets and their propensity to influence on efforts made by management to manage earnings. We considered the programmes and controls that the 
Group has established to address risks identified, or that otherwise prevent, deter and detect fraud; and how senior management monitors those 
programmes and controls. Where the risk was considered to be higher, we performed audit procedures to address each identified fraud risk. These 
procedures included testing manual journals and were designed to provide reasonable assurance that the financial statements were free of fraud or error.
 – Based on this understanding we designed our audit procedures to identify non-compliance with such laws and regulations identified in the paragraphs 
above. Our procedures involved: journal entry testing, with a focus on manual consolidation journals and journals indicating large or unusual transactions 
based on our understanding of the business; enquiries of legal counsel, Group management, internal audit and all full and specific scope management; 
and focused testing, as referred to in the key audit matters section above.
 – In addition, we concluded that there are certain significant laws and regulations which may have an effect on the determination of the amounts and 
disclosures in the financial statements being the Listing Rules of the UK Listing Authority, and those laws and regulations relating to health and safety and 
environmental matters. 
A further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements is located on the Financial Reporting Council’s website at https://www.
frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities. This description forms part of our Auditor’s report.
Other matters we are required to address 
 – We were appointed by the Company on 16 October 2006 to audit the financial statements of the Company for the period ending 31 December 2006 and 
subsequent financial periods. Following a competitive tender process, we were reappointed as Auditor of the Company for the period ending 31 
December 2016 and subsequent financial periods.
 – The period of total uninterrupted engagement including previous renewals and reappointments is 12 years, covering periods from our initial appointment 
in 2006 through to the year ended 31 December 2017.
 – The non-audit services prohibited by the FRC’s Ethical Standard were not provided to the Group or the parent company and we remain independent of 
the Group and the parent company in conducting the audit. 
 – The audit opinion is consistent with the additional report to the Audit Committee.

Notes to the consolidated financial statements
For the year ended 31 December 2017
Annual Report & Accounts 2017 
Hochschild Mining plc 98 2 Significant accounting policies 
(a) Basis of preparation 
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted by the 
European Union (EU) and the Companies Act 2006. 
The basis of preparation and accounting policies used in preparing the consolidated financial statements for the years ended 31 December 2017 and 2016 
are set out below. The consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a historical cost basis except for the revaluation of certain financial 
instruments that are measured at fair value at the end of each reporting period, as explained below. These accounting policies have been consistently 
applied, except for the effects of the adoption of new and amended accounting standard.
The financial statements are presented in US dollars (US$) and all monetary amounts are rounded to the nearest thousand ($000) except when  
otherwise indicated. 
The financial statements have been prepared on the going concern basis. Details of the factors which have been taken into account in assessing the Group’s 
going concern status are set out within the Directors’ Report.
Changes in accounting policy and disclosures 
The accounting policies adopted in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements are consistent with those applied in the preparation of the 
consolidated financial statement for the year ended 31 December 2016. Amendments to standards and interpretations which came into force during the 
year did not have a significant impact on the Group’s financial statements and are as follows:
 – IAS 7 Statement of cash flows, applicable for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2017
The amendments require entities to provide disclosures about changes in their liabilities arising from financing activities, including both changes arising 
from cash flows and non-cash changes. The adoption of these amendments would not have an impact on the Group´s financial position or performance. 
The Group has provided the information for the current year in note 25.
 – IAS 12 Income T axes, applicable for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2017
The amendments clarify the accounting for deferred tax assets for unrealised losses on debt instruments measured at fair value. Entities are required to 
apply the amendments retrospectively. The adoption of these rules did not have a significant impact on the Group´s financial position or performance. 
Standards, interpretations and amendments to existing standards that are not yet effective and have not been previously adopted by the Group 
Certain new standards, amendments and interpretations to existing standards have been published and are mandatory for the Group’s accounting periods 
beginning on or after 1 January 2018 or later periods but which the Group has not previously adopted. Those that are applicable to the Group are as 
follows: 
 – IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers, applicable for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018
The IASB has issued a new standard for the recognition of revenue arising from contracts with customers. The new revenue standard will supersede all 
current revenue recognition requirements under IFRS. 
The new standard is based on the principle that revenue is recognised when control of a good or service transfers to a customer. The Group has evaluated 
recognition and measurement of revenue based on the five-step model in IFRS 15 and has not identified significant financial impacts, hence no adjustments 
will be recorded derived from the adoption of IFRS 15 other than certain reclassifications as explained below. 
The Group will adopt the new standard from 1 January 2018 applying the simplified transition method and modified retrospective approach. Certain 
disclosures will change as a result of the requirements of IFRS 15.
The key issues identified, and the Group’s views and perspective are set below. These are based on the Group’s current interpretation of IFRS 15 and may be 
subject to changes as interpretations evolve more generally. Furthermore, the Group is considering and will continue to monitor any further development. 
 – Embedded derivatives arising from the sales: As discussed in note 2(p), some of the Group’s sales of gold and silver contain provisional pricing features 
which are currently considered to be embedded derivatives recorded within sales. Under IAS 18, revenue is recognised at the estimated fair value of the 
total consideration received or receivable when the gold and silver is delivered, which is usually when title has passed to the customer. The fair value is 
based on the most recent determined estimate of metal content and the estimated forward price that the entity expects to receive at the end of the 
quotational period stipulated in the contract. The revaluation of provisionally priced contracts is recorded as an adjustment to revenue. IFRS 15 will not 
change the assessment of the provisional price adjustment, however as they are not considered within the scope of IFRS 15, the Group will account for 
these in accordance with IFRS 9. Therefore, subsequent changes in fair value will be recognised in the statement of profit or loss and other 
comprehensive income as part of ‘other income/other expenses’. 
 – Impact of shipping terms: The Group sells a portion of its production on CIF Incoterms and therefore the Group is responsible for shipping services after 
the date at which control of the gold and silver passes to the customer. Under IAS 18, these shipping services are currently not considered to be part of 
the revenue transaction and thus the Group has disclosed them as selling expenses. However, under IFRS 15 the Group should reclassify the portion of 
those selling expenses relating to transport of gold and silver from the Group’s production plants to the ports and reclassify those costs to cost of sales. 
The Group estimates that approximately US$4,800,000 would be reclassified from selling expenses to cost of sales, based on 2017 figures. In addition, 
the Group needs to assess the amount of remaining costs related to shipping services which are considered a separate performance obligation under 
IFRS 15 and therefore a portion of the revenue currently recognised when the title has passed to the customer will need to be deferred and recognised as 
the shipping services are subsequently provided. Based on the analysis performed during 2017, the Group determined that the overall impact on the 
timing of revenue recognition related to these shipping services will not be material and consequently such revenue will not be disclosed separately.

IFRS 9 Financial Instruments addresses the classification, measurement and derecognition of financial assets and financial liabilities, introduces new rules 
for hedge accounting and a new impairment model for financial assets. 
Based on the assessment performed, the Group expects the new guidance to have the following impacts on the classification and measurement of its 
financial instruments:
 – Classification and measurement of the embedded derivatives arising from sales: The financial assets and liabilities arising from the revaluation provisional 
priced contracts is currently disclosed separately in the balance sheet as part of ‘other financial assets/liabilities’. Under IFRS 9, the embedded derivative 
will no longer be separated from the host contract and therefore the revaluation of provisionally priced contracts will be disclosed within the receivable of 
the host contract in ‘trade and other receivables’.
 – Available-for sale financial assets: The equity instruments that are currently classified as available-for-sale financial assets satisfy the conditions for 
classification as at fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI) and therefore there is no impact in classification. However, as opposed to 
the current IFRSs, under IFRS 9 gains and losses accumulated in other comprehensive income are not recycled to the income statement. Furthermore, 
under IFRS 9 there is no exception to carry investments in entities at costs less any recognised impairment and therefore, fair value will need to be 
calculated. There are no other significant changes to the accounting treatment of these assets. 
 – Impairment: The new impairment model requires the recognition of impairment provisions based on expected credit losses (ECL) rather than only 
incurred credit losses as is the case under IAS 39. The Group will apply the simplified approach and record lifetime expected losses on all trade 
receivables. However, given the short-term nature of the Group’s receivables, these are not expected to have a significant impact in the financial 
statements.
 – Disclosures: The new standard also introduces expanded disclosure requirements and changes in presentation. These are expected to change the nature 
and extent of the Group’s disclosures about its financial instruments particularly in the year of the adoption of the new standard.
 – The Group has also assessed other changes introduced by IFRS 9 that will have no impacts in the financial statements as explained below: 
 – The Group does not expect any impact on the accounting for financial liabilities, as the new requirements of IFRS 9 only affect the accounting for financial 
liabilities that are designated at fair value through profit or loss and the Group does not have any such liabilities. 
The Group does not currently apply hedge accounting and therefore there are no impacts in the financial statements.
 – No impacts are expected in relation to derecognition of financial instruments as the same rules have been transferred from IAS 39 Financial Instruments: 
Recognition and Measurement.
 – IFRS 16 Leases, applicable for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2019.
 – IFRS 16 specifies how an IFRS reporter will recognise, measure, present and disclose leases. The standard provides a single lessee accounting model, 
requiring lessees to recognise assets and liabilities for all leases unless the lease term is 12 months or less or the underlying asset has a low value. Lessors 
continue to classify leases as operating or finance, with IFRS 16’s approach to lessor accounting substantially unchanged from its predecessor, IAS 17. The 
Group is analysing the adoption of this new standard and expected not to have a significant impact on the Group´s financial position or performance.
 – IFRS 2 Classification and Measurement of Share-based Payment T ransactions – Amendments to IFRS 2, applicable for annual periods beginning on or 
after 1 January 2018.
The amendments are related to the classification and measurement of share-based payment transactions and it does not require to restate prior periods. 
The adoption of these amendments would not have a significant impact on the Group´s financial position or performance.
 – IFRIC 23 Uncertainty over income tax treatments, applicable for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2019.
IFRIC 23 clarifies the accounting for uncertainties in income taxes. This interpretation is to be applied to the determination of taxable profit (tax loss), tax 
bases, unused tax losses, unused tax credits and tax rates, when there is uncertainty over income tax treatments under IAS 12. The Group will adopt. The 
Interpretation specifically addresses the following:
 – Whether an entity considers uncertain tax treatments separately
 – The assumptions an entity makes about the examination of tax treatments by taxation authorities
 – How an entity determines taxable profit (tax loss), tax bases, unused tax losses, unused tax credits and tax rates
 – How an entity considers changes in facts and circumstances
The interpretation is effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2019, but certain transition reliefs are available. The Group will 
apply interpretation from its effective date, however we do not expect significant impacts on the financial statements on the implementation as the 
Group’s current treatment is in line with the requirements of the interpretation.
The Group is analysing the effect of the standards and plans to adopt the new standards on the required effective date.
Notes to the consolidated financial statements

Annual Report & Accounts 2017 
Hochschild Mining plc 100 (b) Judgements in applying accounting policies and key sources of estimation uncertainty 
Many of the amounts included in the financial statements involve the use of judgement and/or estimation. These judgements and estimates are based on 
management’s best knowledge of the relevant facts and circumstances, having regard to prior experience, but actual results may differ from the amounts 
included in the financial statements. Information about such judgements and estimates is contained in the accounting policies and/or the notes to the 
financial statements. 
Significant areas of estimation uncertainty and critical judgements made by management in preparing the consolidated financial statements include:
Significant estimates:
 – Useful lives of assets for depreciation and amortisation purposes – note 2(e).
Estimates are required to be made by management as to the useful lives of assets. For depreciation calculated under the unit-of-production method, 
estimated recoverable reserves and resources are used in determining the depreciation and/or amortisation of mine-specific assets. This results in a 
depreciation/amortisation charge proportional to the depletion of the anticipated remaining life-of-mine production. Each item’s life, which is assessed 
annually, has regard to both its physical life limitations and to present assessments of economically recoverable reserves and resources of the mine 
property at which the asset is located. These calculations require the use of estimates and assumptions, including the amount of recoverable reserves 
and resources. Changes are accounted for prospectively.
 – Ore reserves and resources – note 2(g).
There are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating ore reserves and resources. Assumptions that are valid at the time of estimation may change 
significantly when new information becomes available. Changes in the forecast prices of commodities, exchange rates, production costs or recovery rates 
may change the economic status of reserves and resources and may, ultimately, result in the reserves and resources being restated.
 – Recoverable values of mining assets – notes 2(i), 16, 17 and 18.
The value of the Group’s mining assets are sensitive to a range of characteristics unique to each mine unit. Key sources of estimation for all assets include 
uncertainty around ore reserve estimates and cash flow projections. In performing impairment reviews, the Group assesses the recoverable amount of its 
operating assets principally with reference to fair value less costs of disposal, assessed using discounted cash flow models. There is judgement involved in 
determining the assumptions that are considered to be reasonable and consistent with those that would be applied by market participants. Key 
judgements include the estimation of future gold and silver prices, future capital requirements, exploration potential, operating performance and the 
application of discount rates which reflect the macro-economic risk in Peru and Argentina as applicable. Changes in these assumptions will affect the 
recoverable amount of the property, plant and equipment, evaluation and exploration assets, and intangibles.
 – Mine closure costs – notes 2(m) and 26(1).
The Group assesses its mine closure cost provision annually. Significant estimates and assumptions are made in determining the provision for mine 
closure cost as there are numerous factors that will affect the ultimate liability payable. These factors include estimates of the extent and costs of 
rehabilitation activities, technological changes, regulatory changes, cost increases, mine life and changes in discount rates. Those uncertainties may result 
in future actual expenditure differing from the amounts currently provided. The provision at the balance sheet date represents management’s best 
estimate of the present value of the future closure costs required. 
 – Liability for cash-settled share-based payments – notes 26(2).
The Group initially measures the cost of cash-settled transactions with employees using the Monte Carlo model to determine the fair value of the liability 
incurred. The liability needs to be remeasured at the end of each reporting period up to the date of settlement, with any changes in fair value recognised 
in the profit or loss. This requires a reassessment of the estimates used at the end of each reporting period, including the anticipated potential changes 
to the T otal Shareholder Return (‘TSR’) performance, the number of participants in the plan, and levels of interest rates. The assumptions and models 
used for estimating fair value are discussed in note 26(2).
 – Income tax – notes 2(r), 14, 28 and 34.
Judgement is required in determining whether deferred tax assets are recognised on the statement of financial position. Deferred tax assets, including 
those arising from un-utilised tax losses require management to assess the likelihood that the Group will generate taxable earnings in future periods, in 
order to utilise recognised deferred tax assets. Estimates of future taxable income are based on forecast cash flows from operations and the application 
of existing tax laws in each jurisdiction. T o the extent that future cash flows and taxable income differ significantly from estimates, the ability of the Group 
to realise the net deferred tax assets recorded at the balance sheet date could be impacted.
Judgement is also required when determining the provision for taxes as the tax treatment of some transactions cannot be finally determined until a formal 
resolution has been reached with the tax authorities. Provisions are also made for uncertain exposures which can have an impact on both deferred and 
current tax. T ax benefits are not recognised unless it is probable that the benefit will be obtained and tax provisions are made if it is probable that a liability 
will arise (refer to note 34(a)). The final resolution of these transactions may give rise to material adjustments to the income statement and/or cash flow 
in future periods. The Group reviews each significant tax liability or benefit each period to assess the appropriate accounting treatment.

Critical judgements:
 – Determination of functional currencies – note 2(d).
The determination of functional currency requires management judgement, particularly where there may be several currencies in which transactions are 
undertaken and which impact the economic environment in which the entity operates. 
 – Recognition of evaluation and exploration assets and transfer to development costs – notes 2(f), 16 and 17.
Judgement is required in determining when the future economic benefit of a project can reasonably be regarded as assured, at which point evaluation 
and exploration expenses are capitalised. This includes the assessment of whether there is sufficient evidence of the probability of the existence of 
economically recoverable minerals to justify the commencement of capitalisation of costs; the timing of the end of the exploration phase, the start of the 
development phase; and the commencement of the production phase. For this purpose, the future economic benefit of the project can reasonably be 
regarded as assured when the Board authorises management to conduct a feasibility study, mine-site exploration is being conducted to convert resources 
to reserves, or mine-site exploration is being conducted to confirm resources, all of which are based on supporting geological information.
 – Significant judgement and assumptions for assets classified as held for sale – note 23.
T o determine whether an asset should be classified as an asset held for sale in accordance with IFRS 5, consideration should be given as to whether the 
sale is ‘highly probable’. The three main criteria are: There is a plan in place to sell the asset, the sale is due to complete within 12 months of the year end; 
and that it is unlikely that significant changes to the plan will be made or the sale withdrawn. As disclosed in note 23, despite the final payment date for 
the sale of San Felipe property being within 12 months, all the three criteria to be considered ‘highly probable’ (as defined by IFRS 5) have not been met 
and therefore the property has not been classified as an asset held for sale. 
(c) Basis of consolidation 
The consolidated financial statements set out the Group’s financial position, performance and cash flows as at 31 December 2017 and 31 December 2016 
and for the years then ended, respectively. 
Subsidiaries are those entities controlled by the Group regardless of the amount of shares owned by the Group. Control is achieved when the Group is 
exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the investee and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the 
investee. Non-controlling interests’ rights to safeguard their interest are fully considered in assessing whether the Group controls a subsidiary. Specifically, 
the Group controls an investee if, and only if, the Group has: 
 – power over the investee (i.e. existing rights that give it the current ability to direct the relevant activities of the investee); 
 – exposure, or rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the investee; and 
 – the ability to use its power over the investee to affect its returns.
Generally, there is a presumption that a majority of voting rights result in control. T o support this presumption and when the Group has less than a majority of 
the voting or similar rights of an investee, the Group considers all relevant facts and circumstances in assessing whether it has power over an investee, including:
 – the contractual arrangement with the other vote holders of the investee; 
 – rights arising from other contractual arrangements; and 
 – the Group’s voting rights and potential voting rights. 
The Group reassesses whether or not it controls an investee if facts and circumstances indicate that there are changes to one or more of the three 
elements of control.
Basis of consolidation 
Subsidiaries are consolidated from the date of their acquisition, being the date on which the Group obtains control, and continue to be consolidated until 
the date that such control ceases. 
A change in the ownership interest of a subsidiary, without loss of control, is accounted for as an equity transaction, affecting retained earnings. If the 
Group loses control over a subsidiary, it (i) derecognises the assets (including goodwill) and liabilities of the subsidiary; (ii) derecognises the carrying 
amount of any non-controlling interest (‘NCI’); (iii) derecognises the cumulative translation differences, recorded in equity; (iv) recognises the fair value 
of the consideration received; (v) recognises the fair value of any investment retained; (vi) recognises any surplus or deficit in profit or loss; and (vii) 
reclassifies the parent’s share of components previously recognised in other comprehensive income to profit or loss or retained earnings, as appropriate.
An NCI represents the equity in a subsidiary not attributable, directly and indirectly, to the parent company and is presented separately within equity in the 
consolidated statement of financial position, separately from equity attributable to owners of the parent.
Losses within a subsidiary are attributable to the NCI even if that results in a deficit balance.
Business combinations 
Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method. The cost of an acquisition is measured as the aggregate of the consideration 
transferred, measured at acquisition date fair value and the amount of any NCI in the acquiree. The choice of measurement of NCI, either at fair value  
or at the proportionate share of the acquiree’s identifiable net assets, is determined on a transaction by transaction basis. Acquisition costs incurred are 
expensed and included in administrative expenses. 
Goodwill is initially measured at cost, being the excess of the aggregate of the consideration transferred and the amount recognised for the NCI, and any 
previously interest held, over the net identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed. Assets acquired and liabilities assumed in transactions separate 
to the business combinations, such as the settlement of pre-existing relationships or post-acquisition remuneration arrangements, are accounted for 
separately from the business combination in accordance with their nature and applicable IFRSs. Identifiable intangible assets meeting either the 
contractual-legal or the separability criterion are recognised separately from goodwill. Contingent liabilities representing a present obligation are recognised 
if the acquisition date fair value can be measured reliably.

Hochschild Mining plc 102 (d) Currency translation 
The functional currency for each entity in the Group is determined by the currency of the primary economic environment in which it operates. For the 
holding companies and operating entities this currency is US dollars and for the other entities it is the local currency of the country in which it operates. 
The Group’s financial information is presented in US dollars, which is the Company’s functional currency. 
T ransactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the entity are initially recorded in the functional currency using the exchange 
rate ruling at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are remeasured at the rate of exchange ruling at 
the statement of financial position date. Exchange gains and losses on settlement of foreign currency transactions which are translated at the rate 
prevailing at the date of the transactions, or on the translation of monetary assets and liabilities which are translated at period-end exchange rates, are 
taken to the income statement. Non-monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies that are stated at historical cost are translated to the 
functional currency at the foreign exchange rate prevailing at the date of the transaction. Exchange differences arising from monetary items that are part of 
a net investment in a foreign operation are recognised in equity and transferred to income on disposal of such net investment. 
Subsidiary financial statements expressed in their corresponding functional currencies are translated into US dollars by applying the exchange rate at 
period-end for assets and liabilities and the transaction date exchange rate for income statement items. The resulting difference on consolidation is 
included as cumulative translation adjustment in equity. 
(e) Property, plant and equipment 
Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost or deemed cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses. Cost comprises its purchase price 
and directly attributable costs of acquisition or construction required to bring the asset to the condition necessary for the asset to be capable of operating 
in the manner intended by management. Economical and physical conditions of assets have not changed substantially over this period. 
The cost less residual value of each item of property, plant and equipment is depreciated over its useful life. Each item’s estimated useful life has been 
assessed with regard to both its own physical life limitations and the present assessment of economically recoverable reserves and resources of the mine 
property at which the item is located. Estimates of remaining useful lives are made on a regular basis for all mine buildings, machinery and equipment, with 
annual reassessments for major items. Depreciation is charged to cost of production on a units-of-production basis for mine buildings and installations and 
plant and equipment used in the mining production process, or charged directly to the income statement over the estimated useful life of the individual 
asset on a straight-line basis when not related to the mining production process. Changes in estimates, which mainly affect units-of-production 
calculations, are accounted for prospectively. Depreciation commences when assets are available for use. Land is not depreciated. 
An asset’s carrying amount is written-down immediately to its recoverable amount if the asset’s carrying amount is greater than its estimated  
recoverable amount.
Gains and losses on disposals are determined by comparing the net proceeds with the carrying amount and are recognised within other income/expenses, 
in the income statement. 
The expected useful lives under the straight-line method are as follows: 
Years
Buildings 3 to 33
Plant and equipment 5 to 10
Vehicles 5
Borrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition or construction of an asset that necessarily takes a substantial period of time to be ready for its 
intended use are capitalised as part of the cost of the asset. All other borrowing costs are expensed where incurred. For borrowings associated with a 
specific asset, the actual rate on that borrowing is used. Otherwise, a weighted average cost of borrowing is used. The Group capitalises the borrowing 
costs related to qualifying assets with a value of US$1,000,000 or more, considering that the substantial period of time to be ready is six or more months.
Mining properties and development costs 
Purchased mining properties are recognised as assets at their cost of acquisition or at fair value if purchased as part of a business combination. Costs 
associated with developments of mining properties are capitalised.
Mine development costs are, upon commencement of commercial production, depreciated using the units-of-production method based on the estimated 
economically recoverable reserves and resources to which they relate. 
When a mine construction project moves into the production stage, the capitalisation of certain mine construction costs ceases and costs are either 
regarded as part of the cost of inventory or expensed, except for costs which qualify for capitalisation relating to mining asset additions or improvements, 
underground mine development or mineable reserve development. In addition, the revenue generated for the sale of the inventory produced during the 
pre-operating stage is recognised as a deduction of the costs capitalised for this project.
Construction in progress and capital advances
Assets in the course of construction are capitalised as a separate component of property, plant and equipment. Once the asset moves into the production 
phase, the cost of construction is transferred to the appropriate category. Construction in progress is not depreciated. 
Subsequent expenditure 
Expenditure incurred to replace a component of an item of property, plant and equipment is capitalised separately with the carrying amount of the 
component being written-off. Other subsequent expenditure is capitalised if future economic benefits will arise from the expenditure.  
All other expenditure including repairs and maintenance expenditures are recognised in the income statement as incurred.

(f) Evaluation and exploration assets
Evaluation and exploration expenses are capitalised when the future economic benefit of the project can reasonably be regarded as assured.
Projects in the development phase – Exploration and evaluation costs are capitalised as assets from the date that the Board authorises management to 
conduct a feasibility study. 
Expenditure is transferred to mine development costs once the work completed to date supports the future development of the property and such 
development receives appropriate approval.
Identification of resources – Costs incurred in converting inferred resources to indicated and measured resources (of which reserves are a component) 
are capitalised as incurred. Costs incurred in identifying inferred resources are expensed as incurred. 
(g) Determination of ore reserves and resources 
The Group estimates its ore reserves and mineral resources based on information compiled by internal competent persons. Reports to support these 
estimates are prepared each year and are stated in conformity with the 2012 Joint Ore Reserves Committee (JORC) code.
It is the Group’s policy to have the report audited by a Competent Person. 
Reserves and resources are used in the units-of-production calculation for depreciation as well as the determination of the timing of mine closure cost and 
impairment analysis. 
(h) Intangible assets 
Right to use energy of transmission line
T ransmission line costs represent the investment made by the Group during the period of its use. This is an asset with a finite useful life equal to that of the 
mine to which it relates and that is amortised applying the units-of-production method for that mine.
Water permits
Water permits represent the cost that allow the holder to withdraw a specified amount of water from the ground for reasonable, beneficial uses. This is an 
asset with an indefinite useful life.
Legal rights
Legal rights correspond to expenditures required to give the Group the right to use a property for the surface exploration work, development and 
production. This is an asset with a finite useful life equal to that of the mine to which it relates and that is amortised applying the units-of-production 
method for that mine.
Other intangible assets 
Other intangible assets are primarily computer software which are capitalised at cost and are amortised on a straight-line basis over their useful life of  
three years.
(i) Impairment of non-financial assets 
Assets that have an indefinite useful life are not subject to amortisation and are tested annually for impairment. 
The carrying amounts of property, plant and equipment and evaluation and exploration assets are reviewed for impairment if events or changes in 
circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. If there are indicators of impairment, an exercise is undertaken to determine 
whether the carrying values are in excess of their recoverable amount. Such review is undertaken on an asset by asset basis, except where such assets do 
not generate cash flows independent of other assets, and then the review is undertaken at the cash-generating unit level. 
The assessment requires the use of estimates and assumptions such as long-term commodity prices, discount rates, future capital requirements, 
exploration potential and operating performance. Changes in these assumptions will affect the recoverable amount of the property, plant and equipment 
and evaluation and exploration assets.
If the carrying amount of an asset or its cash-generating unit (CGU) exceeds the recoverable amount, an impairment provision is recorded to reflect the 
asset at the lower amount. Impairment losses are recognised in the income statement. 
Calculation of recoverable amount 
The recoverable amount of assets is the greater of their value in use (VIU) and fair value less costs of disposal (FVLCD) to sell. FVLCD is based on an 
estimate of the amount that the Group may obtain in a sale transaction on an arm’s length basis. VIU is based on estimated future cash flows discounted to 
their present value using a discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset. For an 
asset that does not generate cash inflows largely independent of those from other assets, the recoverable amount is determined for the CGU to which the 
asset belongs. 
The recoverable values of the CGU are determined using a FVLCD methodology. FVLCD was determined using a combination of Level 2 and Level 3 inputs 
to construct a discounted cash flow model to estimate the amount that would be paid by a willing third party in an arm’s length transaction. 
Reversal of impairment 
An impairment loss is reversed if there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the recoverable amount. An impairment loss is reversed only 
to the extent that the asset’s carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation or amortisation, 
if no impairment loss had been recognised.

Annual Report & Accounts 2017 
Hochschild Mining plc 104 (j) Inventories 
Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or net realisable value. Cost is determined using the weighted average method. 
The cost of work in progress and finished goods (ore inventories) is based on the cost of production. For this purpose, the costs of production include:
 – costs, materials and contractor expenses which are directly attributable to the extraction and processing of ore;
 – depreciation of property, plant and equipment used in the extraction and processing of ore; and
 – related production overheads (based on normal operating capacity).
Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less applicable variable selling expenses.
(k) Trade and other receivables 
Current trade receivables are carried at the original invoice amount less provision made for impairment of these receivables. Non current receivables are 
stated at amortised cost. A provision for impairment of trade receivables is established when there is objective evidence that the Group will not be able to 
collect all amounts due according to the original terms of the receivable which on average, do not exceed 30 days. The amount of the provision is the 
difference between the carrying amount and the recoverable amount and this difference is recognised in the income statement. 
(l) Share capital 
Ordinary shares are classified as equity. Any excess above the par value of shares received upon issuance of those shares is classified as share premium.  
In the case the excess above par value is available for distribution, it is classified as merger reserve and then transferred to retained earnings.
(m) Provisions 
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past event, it is probable that an outflow of 
resources will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation. If the effect of the time value of 
money is material, provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of 
the time value of money and, where appropriate, the risks specific to the liability. Where discounting is used, the increase in the provision due to the 
passage of time is recognised as a finance cost. 
Mine closure cost 
Provisions for mine closure costs are made in respect of the estimated future costs of closure and restoration and for environmental rehabilitation costs 
(which include the dismantling and demolition of infrastructure, removal of residual materials and remediation of disturbed areas) in the accounting 
period when the related environmental disturbance occurs. The provision is discounted and the unwinding of the discount is included in finance costs. At 
the time of establishing the provision, a corresponding asset is capitalised and is depreciated over future production from the mine to which it relates. The 
provision is reviewed on an annual basis for changes in cost estimates, discount rates and operating lives. 
Changes to estimated future costs are recognised in the statement of financial position by adjusting the mine closure cost liability and the related asset 
originally recognised. If, for mature mines, the related mine assets net of mine closure cost provisions exceed the recoverable value, that portion of the 
increase is charged directly to the income statement. Similarly, for reductions to the estimated costs exceeding the carrying value of the mine asset, that 
portion of the decrease is credited directly to the income statement. For closed sites, changes to estimated costs are recognised immediately in the 
income statement.
Workers’ profit sharing and other employee benefits 
In accordance with Peruvian legislation, companies in Peru must provide for workers’ profit sharing equivalent to 8% of taxable income of each year. This 
amount is charged to the income statement within personnel expenses (note 10) and is considered deductible for income tax purposes. The Group has no 
pension or retirement benefit schemes. 
Other 
Other provisions are accounted for when the Group has a legal or constructive obligation for which it is probable there will be an outflow of resources for 
which the amount can be reliably estimated. 
(n) Share-based payments
Cash-settled transactions
The fair value of cash-settled share plans is recognised as a liability over the vesting period of the awards. Movements in that liability between reporting 
dates are recognised as personnel expenses. The fair value of the awards is taken to be the market value of the shares at the date of award adjusted by a 
factor for anticipated relative TSR performance. Fair values are subsequently remeasured at each reporting date to reflect the number of awards expected 
to vest based on the current and anticipated TSR performance. 
Equity-settled transactions
The cost of equity-settled transactions is recognised, together with a corresponding increase in other reserves in equity, over the period in which the 
performance and/or service conditions are fulfilled. The cumulative expense recognised for equity-settled transactions at each reporting date until the 
vesting date reflects the extent to which the vesting period has expired and the Group’s best estimate of the number of equity instruments that vest. The 
income statement expense for a period represents the movement in cumulative expense recognised as at the beginning and end of that period and is 
recognised in personnel expenses (note 10). 
(o) Contingencies 
Contingent liabilities are not recognised in the financial statements and are disclosed in notes to the financial statements unless their occurrence is remote. 
Contingent assets are not recognised in the financial statements, but are disclosed in the notes if their recovery is deemed probable.

(p) Revenue recognition 
The Group is involved in the production and sale of gold and silver from doré and concentrate containing both gold and silver. Doré bars are either sold 
directly to customers or are sent to a third party for further refining into gold and silver before they are sold. Concentrate is sold directly to customers.
Revenue is recognised to the extent that it is probable that economic benefits will flow to the Group and the revenue can be reliably measured. 
Revenue associated with the sale of gold and silver from doré and concentrate is recognised in the income statement when all significant risks and rewards 
of ownership are transferred to the customer, usually when title has passed to the customer. Revenue excludes any applicable sales taxes.
The revenue is subject to adjustment based on inspection of the product by the customer. Revenue is initially recognised on a provisional basis using the 
Group’s best estimate of contained gold and silver. Any subsequent adjustments to the initial estimate of metal content are recorded in revenue once they 
have been determined. 
In addition, certain sales are ‘provisionally priced’ where the selling price is subject to final adjustment at the end of a period, normally ranging from 15 to 
90 days after the start of the delivery process to the customer, based on the market price at the relevant quotation point stipulated in the contract. 
Revenue is initially recognised when the conditions set out above have been met, using market prices at that date. The price exposure is considered to be 
an embedded derivative and hence separated from the sales contract at each reporting date. The provisionally priced metal is revalued based on the 
forward selling price for the quotational period stipulated in the contract until the quotational period ends. The selling price of gold and silver can be 
measured reliably as these metals are actively traded on international exchanges. The revaluation of provisionally priced contracts is recorded as an 
adjustment to revenue. 
Income from services provided to related parties (note 30) is recognised in revenue when services are provided. 
Deferred revenue results when cash is received in advance of revenue being earned. Deferred revenue is recorded as a liability until it is earned. Once 
earned, the liability is reduced and revenue is recorded. The Group analyses when revenue is earned or deferred.
(q) Finance income and costs 
Finance income and costs comprise interest expense on borrowings, the accumulation of interest on provisions, interest income on funds invested, unwind 
of discount, gains and losses from the change in fair value of derivative instruments and gains and losses on the disposal of available-for-sale investments. 
Interest income is recognised as it accrues, taking into account the effective yield on the asset. 
(r) Income tax 
Income tax for the year comprises current and deferred tax. Income tax is recognised in the income statement except to the extent that it relates to items 
charged or credited directly to equity, in which case it is recognised in equity. 
Current tax expense is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year, using tax rates enacted at the statement of financial position date, and 
any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years. 
Deferred tax is provided using the balance sheet liability method, providing for temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities 
for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes, with the following exceptions:
 – where the temporary difference arises from the initial recognition of goodwill or of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination 
that at the time of the transaction affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss; and 
 – in respect of taxable temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures, where the timing of the reversal of 
the temporary differences can be controlled and it is probable that the temporary differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply to the period when the asset is realised or the liability is settled 
based on the tax rates (and tax laws) that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the statement of financial position date. 
A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the asset can be utilised. 
Deferred tax assets are reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that the related tax benefit will be realised. 
(s) Uncertain tax positions 
An estimates tax liability is recognised when the Group has a present obligation as a result of a past event, it is probable that the Group will be required to 
settle that obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation. The provision is the best estimate of the consideration required 
to settle the present obligation at the balance sheet date, taking into account risks and uncertainties surrounding the obligation. Separate provisions for 
interest and penalties are also recorded if appropriate. 
Movements in interest and penalty amounts in respect of tax provisions are not included in the tax charge, but are disclosed in the income statement. T ax 
provisions are based on management’s interpretation of country specific tax law and the likelihood of settlement. This involves a significant amount of 
judgement as tax legislation can be complex and open to different interpretation. Management uses in-house tax experts, professional firms and previous 
experience when assessing tax risks. Where actual tax liabilities differ from the provisions, adjustments are made which can have a material impact on the 
Group’s profits for the year. Refer to note 34(a) for specific tax contingencies. 
Notes to the consolidated financial statements

Annual Report & Accounts 2017 
Hochschild Mining plc 106 (t) Leases 
Finance leases, which transfer to the Group substantially all the risks and rewards incidental to ownership of the leased item, are capitalised at the inception 
of the lease at the fair value of the leased asset or, if lower, at the present value of the minimum lease payments. Lease payments are apportioned between 
finance charges and the reduction of the lease liability so as to achieve a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability. Finance 
charges are reflected in the income statement. The depreciation policy for leased assets is consistent with that for similar assets owned. 
A lease is classified as an operating lease if it does not transfer substantially all of the risks and rewards incidental to ownership. Operating lease payments 
are recognised as an expense in the income statement on a straight-line basis over the lease term. 
(u) Financial instruments 
Financial assets and liabilities are recognised when the Group becomes party to the contracts that give rise to them and are classified as loans or borrowings, 
receivables, payables, financial instruments fair valued through profit and loss, available-for-sale financial assets or as derivatives designated as hedging 
instruments in an effective hedge (refer to note 2(y)), as appropriate. The Group determines the classification of its financial assets and liabilities at initial 
recognition and, where allowed and appropriate, re-evaluates this designation at each financial year-end. When financial assets and liabilities are recognised 
initially, they are measured at fair value, being the transaction price plus, in the case of financial assets not at fair value through profit or loss and borrowings, 
directly attributable transaction costs. The Group considers whether a contract contains an embedded derivative when the entity first becomes a party to it. 
The embedded derivatives are separated from the host contract if it is not measured at fair value through profit or loss and when the economic characteristics 
and risks are not closely related to those of the host contract. Reassessment only occurs if there is a change in the terms of the contract that significantly 
modifies the cash flows that would otherwise be required. All regular way purchases and sales of financial assets are recognised on the trade date, being the 
date that the Group commits to purchase or sell the asset. Regular way transactions require delivery and receipt of assets within the timeframe generally 
established by regulation or convention in the marketplace. The subsequent measurement of financial assets depends on their classification, as follows: 
Financial assets at fair value through profit and loss 
Financial assets at fair value through profit and loss includes financial assets held for trading and financial assets designated upon initial recognition as at fair 
value through profit and loss. 
Financial assets are classified as held for trading if they are acquired for the purpose of selling in the near term. Derivatives, including separated embedded 
derivatives, are also classified as held for trading unless they are designated as effective hedging instruments or a financial guarantee contract. Gains or 
losses on financial assets held for trading are recognised in the income statement. 
Loans and receivables 
Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market, do not qualify as 
trading assets and have not been designated as either fair value through profit and loss or available-for-sale. Such assets are carried at amortised cost using 
the effective interest method if the time value of money is significant. Gains and losses are recognised in the income statement when the loans and 
receivables are derecognised or impaired, as well as through the amortisation process. 
Available-for-sale financial assets 
Available-for-sale financial assets are those non-derivative financial assets that are designated as such or are not classified as loans and receivables, 
held-to-maturity investments or financial assets at fair value through profit and loss. After initial recognition, available-for-sale financial assets are measured 
at fair value with unrealised gains or losses being recognised as a separate component of equity until the investment is derecognised or until the investment 
is determined to be impaired at which time the cumulative gain or loss previously reported in equity is included in the income statement. 
Loans and borrowings 
Borrowings are recognised initially at fair value. After initial recognition, interest bearing loans and borrowings are subsequently measured at amortised 
cost using the effective interest rate method. 
Gains and losses are recognised in the income statement when the liabilities are derecognised as well as through the amortisation process. 
Borrowings are classified as current liabilities unless the Group has an unconditional right to defer settlement of the liability for at least 12 months after the 
statement of financial position date. 
Impairment of financial assets
The Group assesses at each statement of financial position date whether a financial asset or group of financial assets is impaired. 
Available-for-sale financial assets 
For available-for-sale (AFS) financial investments, the Group assesses at each reporting date whether there is objective evidence that an investment or a 
group of investments is impaired.
In the case of equity investments classified as available-for-sale, objective evidence would include a significant or prolonged decline in the fair value of the 
investment below its cost, where ‘significant’ is estimated to be around 30% of the original cost of the investment and ‘prolonged’ is more than 12 months. 
In addition, the Group analyses any case taking into account the portfolio of projects of the investee, the key technical personnel and the viability of the 
investee to finance its projects. If an available-for-sale asset is impaired, an amount comprising the difference between its cost (net of any principal 
payment and amortisation) and its fair value is transferred from equity to the income statement. Reversals of impairment losses on debt instruments are 
reversed through the income statement, if the increase in fair value of the instrument can be objectively related to an event occurring after the impairment 
loss was recognised in profit or loss. Reversals in respect of equity instruments classified as available-for-sale are not recognised in the income statement.

Derecognition of financial instruments 
A financial asset (or, where applicable a part of a financial asset or part of a group of similar financial assets) is derecognised when: 
 – the rights to receive cash flows from the asset have expired; or 
 – the Group has transferred its rights to receive cash flows from the asset or has assumed an obligation to pay the received cash flows in full without 
material delay to a third party under a ‘pass-through’ arrangement; and either: (a) the Group has transferred substantially all the risks and rewards of the 
asset; or (b) the Group has neither transferred nor retained substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset, but has transferred control of the asset.
When the Group has transferred its rights to receive cash flows from an asset or has entered into a pass-through arrangement, and has neither transferred 
nor retained substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset nor transferred control of the asset, a new asset is recognised to the extent of the Group’s 
continuing involvement in the asset. 
Continuing involvement that takes the form of a guarantee over the transferred asset, is measured at the lower of the original carrying amount of the asset 
and the maximum amount of consideration that the Group could be required to repay. 
A financial liability is generally derecognised when the contract that gives rise to it is discharged or cancelled or expires. Where an existing financial liability is 
replaced by another from the same lender on substantially different terms, or the terms of an existing liability are substantially modified, such an exchange 
or modification is treated as a derecognition of the original liability and the recognition of a new liability, such that the difference in the respective carrying 
amounts together with any costs or fees incurred are recognised in profit or loss. 
(v) Dividend distribution 
Dividends on the Company’s ordinary shares are recognised when they have been appropriately authorised and are no longer at the Company’s discretion. 
Accordingly, interim dividends are recognised when they are paid and final dividends are recognised when they are declared following approval by 
shareholders at the Company’s Annual General Meeting.
(w) Cash and cash equivalents 
Cash and cash equivalents are carried in the statement of financial position at cost. For the purposes of the statement of financial position, cash and cash 
equivalents comprise cash on hand and deposits held with banks that are readily convertible into known amounts of cash and which are subject to 
insignificant risk of changes in value. For the purposes of the cash flow statement, cash and cash equivalents, as defined above, are shown net of 
outstanding bank overdrafts. 
Liquidity funds are classified as cash equivalents if the amount of cash that will be received is known at the time of the initial investment and the risk of 
changes in value is considered insignificant. 
(x) Exceptional items 
Exceptional items are those significant items which, due to their nature or the expected infrequency of the events giving rise to them, need to be disclosed 
separately on the face of the income statement to enable a better understanding of the financial performance of the Group and facilitate comparison with 
prior years. Exceptional items mainly include:
 – impairments or write-offs of assets, assets held for sale, property, plant and equipment and evaluation and exploration assets;
 – gains or losses arising on the disposal of subsidiaries, investments or property, plant and equipment;
 – any gain or loss resulting from restructuring within the Group; 
 – taxes and interests owed by the Group following a change in circumstances surrounding tax disputes, resulting in the exposure being assessed as probable;
 – the impact of infrequent labour action related to work stoppages in mine units;
 – the penalties generated by the early termination of agreements with providers of the Group;
 – the reversal of an accumulation of prior year’s tax expenses that resulted from an agreement with the government; and
 – the related tax impact of the above items.
(y) Hedging
The Group used commodity swaps and zero cost collar contracts to hedge certain of its cash flows from product sales against price risk. These derivative 
financial instruments were initially recognised at fair value on the date on which the derivative contract was entered into and were subsequently 
remeasured at fair value. The fair value of these forward contracts was determined by reference to market values for similar instruments.
These forward contracts were classified as cash flow hedges as they were hedging the Group’s exposure to variability in cash flows that was attributable to 
a particular risk associated with a highly probable forecast sales transaction.
At the inception of a hedging relationship, the Group formally designated and documented the hedge relationship to which the Group wished to apply 
hedge accounting and the risk management objective and strategy for undertaking the hedge. The documentation included identification of the hedging 
instrument, the hedged item or transaction, the nature of the risk being hedged and how the entity would assess the hedging instrument’s effectiveness in 
offsetting the exposure to changes in the hedged item’s fair value or cash flows attributable to the hedged risk. Such hedges were expected to be highly 
effective in offsetting changes in fair value or cash flows and were assessed on an ongoing basis to determine their effectiveness in the financial reporting 
periods for which they were designated. 
Where the commodity forward contracts meet the strict criteria for hedge accounting, the effective portion of the gain or loss on the hedging instrument 
was recognised directly in equity, while any ineffective portion was recognised immediately in the income statement. In the case of zero cost collar 
contracts, the time value had to be accounted for at fair value through profit or loss, in consequence the change in the time value would be recognised in 
the income statement.
Notes to the consolidated financial statements
continued
Annual Report & Accounts 2017 
Hochschild Mining plc 108 Amounts taken to equity were transferred to the income statement when the hedged transaction affected profit or loss, such as when the forecast 
transaction occurred.
If the forecast sales transaction was no longer expected to occur, amounts previously recognised in equity were transferred to the income statement. If the 
hedging instrument expired or was sold, terminated or exercised without replacement or rollover, or if its designation as a hedge was revoked, amounts 
previously recognised in equity remain in equity until the forecast sales transaction occurred.
(z) Fair value measurement
The Group measures financial instruments such as derivatives and non-financial assets at fair value at each statement of financial position date. Also, fair 
values of financial instruments are measured at amortised cost.
Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the 
measurement date. The fair value measurement is based on the presumption that the transaction to sell the asset or transfer the liability takes place either:
 – in the principal market for the asset or liability; or
 – in the absence of a principal market, in the most advantageous market for the asset or liability.
The principal or the most advantageous market must be accessible by the Group.
The fair value of an asset or a liability is measured using the assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability, assuming 
that market participants act in their economic best interest.
A fair value measurement of a non-financial asset takes into account a market participant’s ability to generate economic benefits by using the asset in its 
highest and best use or by selling it to another market participant that would use the asset in its highest and best use.
The Group uses valuation techniques that are appropriate in the circumstances and for which sufficient data are available to measure fair value, maximising 
the use of relevant observable inputs and minimising the use of unobservable inputs.
All assets and liabilities for which fair value is measured or disclosed in the financial statements are categorised within the fair value hierarchy, as described 
in note 36(e).
For assets and liabilities that are recognised in the financial statements on a recurring basis at fair value, the Group determines whether transfers have 
occurred between levels in the hierarchy by reassessing categorisation (based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement as a 
whole) at the end of each reporting period.
The Group determines the policies and procedures for both recurring fair value measurement and unquoted AFS financial assets, and for non-recurring 
measurement.
At each reporting date, the Group analyses the movements in the values of assets and liabilities which are required to be remeasured or reassessed as per 
the Group’s accounting policies. For this analysis, the Group verifies the major inputs applied in the latest valuation by agreeing the information in the 
valuation computation to contracts and other relevant documents.
The Group, in conjunction with its external valuers, where applicable, also compares each of the changes in the fair value of each asset and liability with 
relevant external sources to determine whether the change is reasonable.
For the purpose of fair value disclosures, the Group has determined classes of assets and liabilities on the basis of the nature, characteristics and risks of 
the asset or liability and the level of the fair value hierarchy as explained above.

Further information 3 Segment reporting
The Group’s activities are principally related to mining operations which involve the exploration, production and sale of gold and silver. Products are subject to 
the same risks and returns and are sold through similar distribution channels. The Group undertakes a number of activities solely to support mining operations 
including power generation and services. T ransfer prices between segments are set on an arm’s length basis in a manner similar to that used for third parties. 
Segment revenue, segment expense and segment results include transfers between segments at market prices. Those transfers are eliminated on consolidation. 
For internal reporting purposes, management takes decisions and assesses the performance of the Group through consideration of the following reporting 
segments:
 – Operating units – Arcata and San Jose, which generate revenue from the sale of gold, silver, doré and concentrate
 – Operating unit – Pallancata, which generates revenue from the sale of concentrate
 – Operating unit – Inmaculada, which generates revenue from the sale of gold, silver and doré 
 – Exploration, which explores and evaluates areas of interest in brownfield and greenfield sites with the aim of extending the life-of-mine of existing 
operations and to assess the feasibility of new mines. The exploration segment includes costs charged to the profit and loss and capitalised as assets
 – Other – includes the profit or loss generated by Empresa de T ransmisión Aymaraes S.A.C. (a power transmission company that absorbed Empresa de 
T ransmisión Callalli S.A.C. on 1 June 2016)
The Group’s administration, financing, other activities (including other income and expense), and income taxes are managed at a corporate level and are 
not allocated to operating segments. 
Segment information is consistent with the accounting policies adopted by the Group. Management evaluates the financial information based on 
International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted for use in the European Union.
The Group measures the performance of its operating units by the segment profit or loss that comprises gross profit, selling expenses and exploration expenses.
Segment assets include items that could be allocated directly to the segment.

1 Mine site exploration is performed with the purpose of identifying potential minerals within an existing mine site, with the goal of maintaining or extending the mine’s life. 
2  Prospects expenditure relates to detailed geological evaluations in order to determine zones which have mineralisation potential that is economically viable for exploration. Exploration expenses are generally 
incurred in the following areas: mapping, sampling, geophysics, identification of local targets and reconnaissance drilling. 
3  Generative expenditure is early-stage exploration expenditure related to the basic evaluation of the region to identify prospects areas that have the geological conditions necessary to contain mineral deposits. 
Related activities include regional and field reconnaissance, satellite images, compilation of public information and identification of exploration targets. 
The Group determines the cash flows which relate to the exploration activities of the companies engaged only in exploration. Exploration activities incurred 
by Group operating companies are not included since it is not practicable to separate the liabilities related to the exploration activities of these companies 
from their operating liabilities.
Cash outflows on exploration activities were US$2,600,000 in 2017 (2016: US$1,168,000).

The exceptional items for the year ended 31 December 2017 are as follows:
1  Corresponds to the impairment of the Arcata mine unit of US$43,009,000 and the reversals of impairment related to the Pallancata mine unit of US$31,892,000 and the San Felipe project of US$8,364,000.
2 Corresponds to the deferred tax credit generated by the impairment of the Arcata mine unit, net by the reversal on impairment of the Pallancata mine unit.
The exceptional items for the year ended 31 December 2016 are as follows:
3  Corresponds to the reversal of the reserves tax liability recorded in previous periods and their associated interests as a result of the settlement agreed between Minera Santa Cruz S.A.C. and the Fiscal Authority 
in Argentina.
4  From 16 November 2016 until the end of the year, due to actions by the communities surrounding the Pallancata mine unit, the extracting and treatment operations were temporarily suspended. At 
31 December 2016 the fixed indirect costs related to abnormal decrease in production from the work stoppage amounted to US$2,474,000, corresponding to the Pallancata reporting segment.
5 Penalty for early termination of the energy supply contract between Compañia Minera Ares S.A.C. and SDF Energia.
6  A section of the Ares tailings dam lateral walls showed unusual decay. A comprehensive study was conducted to determine long-term stability and the conclusion was that certain areas needed to be repaired. 
This failure was not anticipated and required works aimed at repairing and reinforcing the walls and ensure the long-term sustainability of the dam had to be conducted. The expenditure incurred was not part 
of our mine closure provision and reflects an unexpected, one-off event.
7 Provision for impairment of the account receivable with a third party due to the uncertainty surrounding the outcome of the legal dispute and hence its recoverability. 
8  As at 31 December 2016 corresponds to the write-off of non-current assets of Compañia Minera Ares S.A.C. of US$1,634,000 arising from events falling outside the entity’s ordinary activities. The charge was 
generated by the change of the exploitation method in the Pallancata mine unit, from mechanised to conventional. 
9  Mainly corresponds to the current tax credit arising from the costs of the work stoppage at Pallancata mine unit, the penalty for early termination of agreement in Compañia Minera Ares S.A.C., the costs 
incurred due to the damage of the tailing dam in Ares mine unit and the reversal of reserves tax in Argentina (US$1,212,000) and the deferred tax credit arising from the write-off of non-current assets and the 
account receivable (US$1,012,000).

1  On 29 December 2017 , the Argentinian government enacted the tax reform. The main change is the decrease of the statutory income tax rate, from its current level of 35% to 30% with effect from 1 January 
2018 and to 25% with effect from 1 January 2020 (2016: In December 2016, the Peruvian government approved an increase of the statutory income tax rate, from its current level of 28% to 29.5% with effect 
from 1 January 2017). 
The weighted average statutory income tax rate was 29.0% for 2017 and 30.1% for 2016. This is calculated as the average of the statutory tax rates 
applicable in the countries in which the Group operates, weighted by the profit/(loss) before tax of the Group companies in their respective countries as 
included in the consolidated financial statements.
The change in the weighted average statutory income tax rate is due to a change in the weighting of profit/(loss) before tax in the various jurisdictions in 
which the Group operates. 
The tax related to items charged or credited to equity is as follows:
As at 31 December

Annual Report & Accounts 2017 
Hochschild Mining plc 118 The effective tax rate for corporate income tax for the period ended 31 December 2017 is 15.9% (2016: 41.9%), compared to the weighted average 
statutory tax rate of 29.0% (2016: 30.1%), and 39.0% (2016: 37.3%) taking into account the mining royalty and the special mining tax which are income 
taxes under IAS 12. The main factor that reduced the effective tax rate for corporate income tax is the deferred tax impact of the reduction of the 
Argentina tax rate and the reversal of San Felipe impairment, which does not attract a deferred tax liability, on the basis that no deferred tax asset arose 
when the impairment was originally recognised.
15 Basic and diluted earnings per share 
Earnings per share (‘EPS’) is calculated by dividing profit for the year attributable to equity shareholders of the Company by the weighted average number 
of ordinary shares issued during the year. 
The Company has dilutive potential ordinary shares. 
As at 31 December 2017 and 2016, EPS has been calculated as follows:

Profit/(loss) from continuing operations before exceptional items and attributable to equity holders of the parent is derived as follows:
As at 31 December
2017 2016
Profit attributable to equity holders of the parent – continuing operations (US$000) 41,561 45,550
Exceptional items after tax – attributable to equity holders of the parent (US$000) (526) 7,604

There were borrowing costs capitalised in property, plant and equipment amounting to US$601,000 (2016: US$825,000). The capitalisation rate used was 
8.27% (2016: 7.23%).
1 Mining properties and development costs related to Crespo project (US$26,016,000) are not currently being depreciated.
2 Net of transfers and other movements of US$1,607 ,000 were transferred from evaluation and exploration assets (note 17).
Management determined there were triggers of impairment in the Arcata mine unit as it has experienced difficulties to replace production with incremental 
resources and to convert resources into reserves, and there was a significant decrease in production during the year. An impairment test was carried 
out resulting in an impairment charge of US$43,009,000 (US$39,905,000 in property, plant and equipment and US$3,104,000 and evaluation and 
exploration assets).
In the case of the Pallancata mine unit, there was an increase in terms of tonnage, grades, and resources and reserves due to the Pablo vein. The Group 
is currently operating the vein, converting inferred resources into reserves, and the process is showing better results than expected in terms of tonnage 
and grades. An impairment test was carried out resulting in an impairment reversal of US$31,892,000 (US$31,509,000 in property, plant and equipment 
and US$383,000 and evaluation and exploration assets).
In addition, management evaluated the carrying value of the San Felipe Project, recognising an impairment reversal of US$8,364,000 (all in evaluation 
and exploration assets) due to the proceeds received in the year (refer to note 23) and the significant increase in zinc market prices over the year resulting 
in an increase of the in-situ value (refer to notes 11 and 17).
No indicators of impairment or reversal of impairment were identified in the other CGUs, which includes other exploration projects. 
The recoverable values of the Arcata and Pallancata CGUs were determined using a fair value less costs of disposal (FVLCD) methodology with the 
exception of San Felipe, where the recoverable value was determined using a value in use (VIU). FVLCD was determined using a combination of Level 2 and 
Level 3 inputs to construct a discounted cash flow model to estimate the amount that would be paid by a willing third party in an arm’s length transaction. 
In assessing the recoverable value of the San Felipe CGU, given the early stage of the project, the Group applied a value-in-situ methodology which applies 
a realisable ‘enterprise value’ to unprocessed mineral resources. The enterprise value used is based on observable external market information. T ogether 
with the US$29,396,000 recognised as a deferred income (refer to note 23) that will be realised once the option is exercised or terminated; the total 
recoverable value of the project under a value in use approach amounts to US$37,081,000.
Notes to the consolidated financial statements

Annual Report & Accounts 2017 
Hochschild Mining plc 120 The key assumptions on which management has based its determination of FVLCD and the associated recoverable values calculated are gold and silver 
prices, production costs, the discount rate and the value per in-situ regarding the San Felipe project. Gold and silver prices used, discount rate applied and 
value per in-situ per zinc equivalent tonne are presented below.

31 December 2017 5,859 91,065 37,081
Sensitivity analysis
Other than as disclosed below, management believes that no reasonably possible change in any of the key assumptions above would cause the carrying 
value of any of its CGUs to exceed its recoverable amount. 
The estimated recoverable amounts of the following of the Group’s CGUs are equal to, or not materially greater than, their carrying values.
As the Arcata CGU was fully impaired at 31 December 2017, a negative change in any of the key assumptions would not have an impact on the impairment 
charge recognised. However, a positive change in the following key assumptions would, in isolation, decrease the impairment charge recorded by: 
US$000
Prices (increase by 10%) 11,696
Post tax discount rate (decrease by 3%) 30
Production costs (decrease by 10%) 9,535
As the impairment charge previously recognised at the Pallancata CGU was fully reversed at 30 June 2017, a positive change in any of the key assumptions 
would not have an impact on the impairment reversal recognised. Similarly, an adverse change in the key assumptions (10% decrease in price, 3% increase 
in post tax discount rate and 10% increase in production costs), in isolation, would still result in a full reversal of the impairment previously recognised.
With respect to the impairment assessment performed at the San Felipe CGU, a decrease of 10% in the value-in-situ per tonne would result in a reversal  
of impairment of US$7,595,000, whilst an increase of 10% would result in a reversal of previously recognised impairment of US$9,132,000.

1 The transmission line is amortised using the units-of-production method. At 31 December 2017 the remaining amortisation period is approximately 8 years (2016: 9 years). 
2  Corresponds to the acquisition of water permits of Andina Minerals Group (‘Andina’). They have an indefinite life according to Chilean law. To determine the fair value less costs of disposal of the Volcan cash-
generating unit, which includes the water permits held by the Group, the Group used the value-in-situ methodology. This methodology applies a realisable ‘enterprise value’ to unprocessed mineral resources 
which was US$7 .10 per gold equivalent ounce of resources at 31 December 2017 (2016: US$6.90). The risk adjusted enterprise value figure has been determined using a combination of Level 2 and Level 3 
inputs to estimate the amount that would be paid by a willing third party in an arm’s length transaction, taking into account the water restrictions imposed by the Chile government. 
3  Legal rights correspond to expenditures required to give the Group the right to use a property for the surface exploration work, development and production. At 31 December 2017 the remaining amortisation 
period is from 10 to 20 years (2016: 8 to 20 years).
4 The amortisation for the period is included in cost of sales and administrative expenses in the income statement.
The carrying amount of the Volcan CGU, which includes the water permits, is reviewed annually to determine whether it is in excess of its recoverable amount.

Sensitivity analysis
Other than as disclosed below, management believes that no reasonably possible change in any of the key assumptions above would cause the carrying 
value, to exceed its recoverable amount. 
The estimated recoverable amount is not materially greater than its carrying value. A change in the value-in-situ assumption could cause an impairment loss 
or reversal of impairment to be recognised as follows:

Goldspot Discoveries Inc. (US$569,000). In addition, 13,415,000 shares of Santa Cruz Silver Mining were received in payment (US$2,780,000) of the option for the San Felipe project (refer note 23) and thus 
no cash consideration was received. With the acquisition of the shares, the Group also acquired 14,545,454 warrants of Red Eagle and 2,443,269 warrants of Cobalt respectively. The warrants were recognised  
at fair value on acquisition and presented as other financial assets.
2  As at 31 December 2016 the Group held an investment in Mariana Resources Ltd which was acquired by Sandstorm Gold on 12 July 2017 . In consideration for the exchange of shares the Group received cash 
proceeds of $407 ,000 and shares of Sandstorm Gold generating a gain of US$1,386,000. On 17 July 2017 the Group disposed its investment in Sandstorm Gold realising a loss on sale of available-for-sale-
financial assets of US$32,000.
The fair value of the listed shares is determined by reference to published price quotations in an active market.
Investments held in Pembrook Mining Corp. (US$11,745,000), ECI Exploration and Mining Inc.(US$2,639,000) and Goldspot Discoveries Inc. 
(US$581,000) are unlisted and recognised at cost less any recognised impairment loss as there is no active market for these investments. The investments 
in Pembrook Mining Corp and ECI Exploration and Mining Inc. are fully impaired as at 31 December 2016 and 2017.

Finished goods include ounces of gold and silver, doré and concentrate. 
Products in process include stockpile and precipitates. 
The Group either sells doré bars as a finished product or if it is commercially advantageous to do so, delivers the bars for refining into gold and silver 
ounces which are then sold. In the latter scenario, the doré bars are classified as products in process. At 31 December 2017 and 2016 the Group had no 
doré on hand included in products in process. 
Concentrate is sold to smelters, but in addition could be used as a product in process to produce doré. 
As part of the Group’s short-term financing policies, it acquires pre-shipment loans which are guaranteed by the sales contracts. 
The amount of expense recognised in profit and loss related to the consumption of inventory of supplies, spare parts and raw materials is US$104,689,000 
(2016: US$86,754,000).
Movements in the provision for obsolescence comprise an increase in the provision of US$542,000 (2016: US$2,162,000) and the reversal of

1  On 3 August 2011, the Group entered into an agreement with Impulsora Minera Santa Cruz (‘IMSC’) whereby IMSC acquired the right to explore the San Felipe properties and an option to purchase the related 
concessions. Under the terms of this agreement the Group has received US$29,396,000 as non-refundable payments at 31 December 2017 (2016: US$25,000,000). 
  These payments will reduce the total consideration that IMSC will be required to pay upon exercise of the option and constitute an advance of the final purchase price, rather than an option premium and, as 
such, they were recorded as deferred income. 
  On 30 November 2016, IMSC renegotiated terms of the agreement, extending the validity of the agreement to 1 December 2017 . As a result of this extension, on 9 March 2017 the Group received in payment 
13,415,000 ordinary shares of Santa Cruz Silver Mining (‘SCSM’) quoted in the Toronto Stock Exchange, at the unit price of CAD 0.28 amounting to CAD 3,756,000 equivalent to US$2,780,000. The amount 
received included valued added taxes of US$384,000 and part consideration of US$2,396,000 recognised as deferred income. 
  On 28 February 2017 , the Group signed a new option agreement with IMSC for the San Felipe properties for a total consideration of US$10,000,000. An initial payment of US$2,000,000 was received in cash on 
7 March 2017 . 
  In March 2017 , IMSC entered into an agreement with Americas Silver Corporation (‘ASC’) to assign 100% of its interest in the San Felipe Project.  
  On 1 December 2017 , the option to sell the San Felipe property to IMSC was extended to 31 December 2018 based on an amendment to the payment terms, and additional US$8,000,000 is payable by IMSC at 
31 December 2017 .
2  On 25 April 2017 the Group signed a five-year option agreement with Minas Argentinas S.A. (‘MASA’) giving MASA the right to explore and the option to purchase the Mosquito property, located in Argentina. 
The Group has received in cash US$2,000,000, recognising US$1,813,000 as deferred income at 31 December 2017 .

1  The provision represents the discounted values of the estimated cost to decommission and rehabilitate the mines at the expected date of closure of each of the mines. The present value of the provision has 
been calculated using a real pre-tax annual discount rate, based on a US Treasury bond of an appropriate tenure adjusted for the impact of quantitative easing as at 31 December 2017 and 2016 respectively,  
and the cash flows have been adjusted to reflect the risk attached to these cash flows. Uncertainties on the timing for use of this provision include changes in the future that could impact the time of closing  
the mines, as new resources and reserves are discovered. The discount rate used was 0.14% (2016: 0.25%). Expected cash flows will be over a period from one to 16 years.
2   Corresponds to the provision related to awards granted under the Long-Term Incentive Plan (‘LTIP’) to designated personnel of the Group. Includes the following benefits: (i) 2017 awards, granted in March 
2017 , payable in March 2020 (ii) 2016 awards, granted in March 2016, payable in March 2019. Only employees who remain in the Group’s employment on the vesting date will be entitled to a cash payment, 
subject to exceptions approved by the Remuneration Committee of the Board. The percentage of the award granted is determined 70% by the Company’s TSR ranking relative to a tailored peer group of mining 
companies, and 30% by the Company’s TSR ranking relative to a peer group of FTSE350 companies. The liability for the LTIP is measured, initially and at the end of each reporting period until settled, at the fair 
value of the awards, by applying the Monte Carlo pricing model, taking into account the terms and conditions on which the awards were granted, and the extent to which the employees have rendered services 
to date. Changes to the provision of US$8,702,000 (2016: US$9,965,000) have been recorded as administrative expenses US$8,215,000 (2016: US$9,298,000) and exploration expenses US$487 ,000 (2016: 
US$667,000).
3  Based on the 2017 internal and external review of mine rehabilitation estimates, the provision for mine closure increased by US$856,000 (2016: US$11,975,000 decrease). The net increase (2016: net decrease) 
mainly corresponds to the Pallancata mine unit of US$1,385,000 (2016: US$447 ,000 decrease), the Inmaculada mine unit of US$1,191,000 (2016: US$1,651,000 increase), the Crespo project of US$43,000 
(2016: US$37 ,000 decrease), the Ares mine unit of US$22,000 (2016: US$1,622,000 decrease) and the Azuca project of US$7 ,000 (2016: US$8,000 decrease), net of the decrease in Arcata mine unit of 
US$1,131,000 (2016: US$6,648,000 decrease), the Selene mine unit of US$607 ,000 (2016: US$698,000 decrease) and San José mine unit of US$54,000 (US$4,166,000 decrease). 
4  US$1,428,000 (2016: US$6,346,000) related to changes in estimate and discount rates for mines already closed and the Arcata mine unit which reduction of the estimated costs exceeded the carrying value of 
the mine asset, therefore the effect has been recognised directly in the income statement.

(b) Treasury shares
T reasury shares represent the cost of Hochschild Mining plc shares purchased in the market and held by the trustee of the Hochschild Mining Employee 
Share T rust to satisfy the award of conditional shares under the Group’s Enhanced Long-T erm Incentive Plan granted to the CEO (note 2(n)). During 
2011, the Group purchased 126,769 shares for the purposes of the plan, for a total consideration of £561,478 (equivalent to US$898,000). No shares 
were purchased by the Group during 2016 and 2017. 
On 20 March 2016, 66,727 T reasury shares with a value of US$472,000 (being the cost incurred to acquire the shares) were transferred to the CEO of the 
Group with respect to the Deferred Bonus Plan benefit. On 20 March 2017, 40,383 T reasury shares with a value of US$286,000 (being the cost incurred to 
acquire the shares) were transferred to the CEO of the Group with respect to the Deferred Bonus Plan benefit. T reasury shares at 31 December 2017 
comprise 67,197 (2016: 107,580) ordinary shares with a value of US$140,000 (2016: US$426,000).
(c) Other reserves 
Unrealised gain/loss on available-for-sale financial assets 
Under IAS 39, the Group classifies its investments in listed companies as available-for-sale financial assets which are carried at fair value. Consequently,  
the increase in carrying values, net of the related deferred tax liability, is taken directly to this account where it will remain until disposal or impairment  
of the investment, when the cumulative unrealised gains and losses are recycled through the income statement. 
Unrealised gain/loss on cash flow hedges
Correspond to the effective portion of the gain or loss on the hedging instruments (refer to note 2(y)).
Cumulative translation adjustment
The cumulative translation adjustment account is used to record exchange differences arising from the translation of the financial statements  
of subsidiaries and associates with a functional currency different to the reporting currency of the Group. 
Merger reserve 
The merger reserve represents the difference between the value of the net assets of the Cayman Holding Companies (Ardsley, Garrison, Larchmont and 
Hochschild Mining (Peru)) acquired under the Share Exchange Agreement and the nominal value of the shares issued in consideration of such acquisition. 
Share-based payment reserve
Share-based payment reserve is used to recognise the value of equity-settled share-based payment transactions provided to employees, as a part of 
their remuneration.

(i) Restricted Share Plan (‘RSP’)
At the beginning of 2015, the Group introduced the RSP, which is a new one-off share-based long-term incentive plan for some executives and key 
employees who play a fundamental role in the performance of the business. 
Under the RSP of the Group, on 30 December 2014 and 16 February 2015, 1,319,392 and 6,026,089 share options with a fair value of 86.8p (US$1.35) 
and 92.3p (US$1.42) per share were granted to the CEO and certain key employees. Following the rights issue in October 2015, the number of share 
options were adjusted to 1,491,572 and 6,812,485 with a fair value of 76.7p (US$1.19) and 81.6p (US$1.25) per share, respectively.
The vesting of the options is subject to the satisfaction of certain performance as well as service conditions classified as non-market conditions. The 
options vest over a five-year period in tranches of 20% of the shares after each of 2, 3 and 4 years and the balance after 5 years.
If the service conditions are not met, the options lapse. As the performance conditions are non-market-based they are not reflected in the fair value of the 
award at grant date, and therefore the Company will assess the likelihood of these conditions being met with a relevant adjustment to the cumulative 
charge as required at each financial year-end.
The fair value of the option was determined with respect to the market price of the shares on the grant date. The awards do not entitle the recipients to 
dividends or payment in lieu of dividends during the vesting period. 
The RSP does not have an exercise price.
On 30 December 2016 the Group issued 1,660,805 ordinary shares under the Restricted Share Plan, to certain employees of the Group, including the CEO.
The carrying amount of the share-based payment reserve relating to the RSP at 31 December 2017 is US$6,048,000 (2016: US$3,958,000) with the 
amount recognised in the consolidated income statement of US$2,090,000 (2016: US$3,181,000).
On 30 December 2017 20% of the options vested, resulting in 1,660,805 ordinary shares that were issued on 2 January 2018. The balance of shares 
pending to vest at 31 December 2017 is 4,982,447 ordinary shares.
(ii) Deferred Bonus Plan (‘DBP’)
At the beginning of 2014, the Group introduced the DBP, as a mechanism to pay the annual bonuses to the employees. Before the approval of DBP the 
annual bonuses were paid entirely in cash. Under the DBP rules a part of the annual bonuses could be deferred into shares for one or two years. A Deferred 
Bonus award granted under the Plan, and the terms of that Deferred Bonus award, must be approved in advance by the Directors.
The fair value of the awards was determined with respect to the market price of the shares on the grant date. The awards do not entitle the recipients to 
dividends or payment in lieu of dividends during the vesting period. The carrying amount of the share-based payment reserve relating to the DBP at 31 
December 2017 is US$43,000 (2016: US$57,000) with the amount recognised in the consolidated income statement of US$34,000 (2016: US$76,000). 
On 20 March 2016 and 20 March 2017, 66,727 and 40,383 T reasury shares were transferred respectively to the CEO of the Group with respect to the DBP. 
(iii) Enhanced Long-term Incentive Plan (‘EL TIP’)
In April 2011 and March 2014, the CEO was granted awards under the EL TIP (397,645 and 1,076,122 shares respectively). Awards were made over 
conditional shares with a value, on the date of grant, equivalent to six times salary and which vest in tranches over an extended performance period of four, 
five and six years. Further details on the design of the EL TIP award and numbers of awards granted are included in the Directors' Remuneration Report.
The fair value of the option was determined using the Monte Carlo model. The carrying amount of the share-based payment reserve relating to the EL TIP 
at 31 December 2017 is US$1,543,000 (2016: US$1,854,000). The amount recognised in the consolidated income statement amounts to US$449,000 
(2016: US$563,000). In addition, US$$760,000 (2016: US$383,000) relating to options that lapsed during the year (204,731 ordinary shares lapsed in 
2017 and 102,365 ordinary shares lapsed in 2016) were transferred from the share-based payment reserve to retain earnings. 
As at 31 December 2017, 1,076,122 ordinary shares are pending to vest (31 December 2016: 1,280,853 ordinary shares). No shares lapsed during the 
year (2016: 204,731 shares).

Hochschild Mining plc 134 33 Commitments
(a) Mining rights purchase options 
During the ordinary course of business, the Group enters into agreements to carry out exploration under concessions held by third parties. Generally, 
under the terms of these agreements, the Group has the option to acquire the concession or invest in the entity holding the concession. In order to 
exercise these options the Group must satisfy certain financial and other obligations during the term of the agreement. The options lapse in the event that 
the Group does not meet its financial obligations. At any point in time, the Group may cancel the agreements without penalty, except where specified 
below. These agreements are not under non-cancellable/irrevocable clauses.
The Group continually reviews its requirements under the agreements and determines, on an annual basis, whether to proceed with its financial 
commitment. Based on management’s current intention regarding these projects, the commitments at the statement of financial position date are as follows: 
As at 31 December
2017

34 Contingencies 
As at 31 December 2017 the Group is subject to various claims which arise in the ordinary course of business. No provision has been made in the financial 
statements and none of these claims are currently expected to result in any material loss to the Group. 
(a) Taxation 
Fiscal periods remain open to review by the tax authorities for four years in Peru and five years in Argentina and Mexico, preceding the year of review. 
During this time the authorities have the right to raise additional tax assessments including penalties and interest. Under certain circumstances, reviews 
may cover longer periods. 
Because a number of fiscal periods remain open to review by the tax authorities, coupled with the complexity of the Group and the transactions 
undertaken by it, there remains a risk that significant additional tax liabilities may arise. As at 31 December 2017, the Group had exposures totalling 
US$46,664,000 (2016: US$43,931,000) which are assessed as ‘possible’, rather than ‘probable’. No amounts have been provided in respect of these items. 
This predominantly relates to potential tax penalties and related interest on intercompany loans. 
Notwithstanding this risk, the Directors believe that management’s interpretation of the relevant legislation and assessment of taxation is appropriate and  
that it is probable that the Group’s tax and customs positions will be sustained in the event of a challenge by the tax authorities. Consequently, the Directors 
consider that they have made adequate provision for any future outflow of resources and no additional provision is required in respect of these claims or risks. 
(b) Guarantees 
The Group is required to provide guarantees in Peru in respect of environmental restoration and decommissioning obligations. The Group has provided for 
the estimated cost of these activities (see note 26).

Peru 
In accordance with Peruvian legislation, owners of mining concessions must pay a mining royalty for the exploitation of metallic and non metallic resources. 
Mining royalties have been calculated with rates ranging from 1% to 3% of the value of mineral concentrate or equivalent sold, based on quoted market prices. 
In October 2011 changes came into effect for mining companies, with the following features:
a)  Introduction of a Special Mining T ax (‘SMT’), levied on mining companies at the stage of exploiting mineral resources. The additional tax is calculated 
by applying a progressive scale of rates ranging from 2% to 8.4%, of the quarterly operating profit. 
b)  Modification of the mining royalty calculation, which consists of applying a progressive scale of rates ranging from 1% to 12%, of the quarterly 
operating profit. The former royalty was calculated on the basis of monthly sales value of mineral concentrates. 
The SMT and modified mining royalty are accounted for as an income tax in accordance with IAS 12 ‘Income T axes’.
c)  For companies that have mining projects benefiting from tax stability regimes, mining royalties are calculated and recorded as they were previously, 
applying an additional new special charge on mining that is calculated using progressive scale rates, ranging from 4% to 13.12% of quarterly 
operating profit. 
d)  In the case of the Arcata mine unit, the Company left the tax stability agreement, but has maintained the agreement for the mining royalties, such that 
the Arcata unit is liable for the new SMT but the mining royalties remain payable at the same rate as they were, before the modification in 2011.
As at 31 December 2017, the amount payable as under the former mining royalty (for the Arcata mining unit), the new mining royalty (for the Ares, 
Pallancata and Inmaculada mining units), and the SMT amounted to US$108,000 (2016: US$170,000), US$1,133,000 (2016: US$769,000), and 
US$492,000 (2016: US$737,000) respectively. The former mining royalty is recorded as ‘T rade and other payables’, and the new mining royalty and SMT 
as ‘Income tax payable’ in the Statement of Financial Position. The amount recorded in the income statement was US$885,000 (2016: US$1,759,000) 
representing the former mining royalty, classified as cost of sales, US$4,201,000 (2016: US$3,882,000) of new mining royalty and US$2,229,000 (2016: 
US$3,869,000) of SMT , both classified as income tax.
Argentina 
In accordance with Argentinian legislation, Provinces (being the legal owners of the mineral resources) are entitled to collect royalties from mine 
operators. For San Jose, the mining royalty applicable to doré and concentrate is 3% of the pit-head value. As at 31 December 2017, the amount payable as 
mining royalties amounted to US$576,000 (2016: US$509,000). The amount recorded in the income statement as cost of sales was US$5,792,000 (2016: 
US$5,747,000).
36 Financial risk management
The Group is exposed to a variety of risks and uncertainties which may have a financial impact on the Group and which also impact the achievement of 
social, economic and environmental objectives. These risks include strategic, commercial, operational and financial risks and are further categorised into 
risk areas to facilitate consolidated risk reporting across the Group. 
The Group has made significant developments in the management of the Group’s risk environment which seeks to identify and, where appropriate, 
implement the controls to mitigate the impact of the Group’s significant risks. This effort is supported by a Risk Committee with the participation of the 
CEO, the Vice Presidents, and the head of the Internal Audit function. The Risk Committee is responsible for implementing the Group’s policy on risk 
management and internal control in support of the Company’s business objectives, and monitoring the effectiveness of risk management within the 
organisation.
(a) Commodity price risk 
Silver and gold prices have a material impact on the Group’s results of operations. Prices are significantly affected by changes in global economic conditions 
and related industry cycles. Generally, producers of silver and gold are unable to influence prices directly; therefore, the Group’s profitability is ensured 
through the control of its cost base and the efficiency of its operations. 
The Group´s policy is generally to remain hedge free. However, management continuously monitors silver and gold prices and reserves the right to take the 
necessary action, where appropriate and within Board approved parameters, to mitigate the impact of this risk.

At 31 December 2017 and 2016 the Group is not exposed to commodity price risk on commodity forward contracts.
The Group has embedded derivatives arising from the sale of concentrate and doré which were provisionally priced at the time the sale was recorded 
(refer to notes 5 and 36(e)). For these derivatives, the sensitivity of the fair value to an immediate 10% favourable or adverse change in the price of gold 
and silver (assuming all other variables remain constant), is as follows:

(b) Foreign currency risk 
The Group produces silver and gold which are typically priced in US dollars. A proportion of the Group’s costs are incurred in pounds sterling, Peruvian 
nuevos soles, Canadian dollars, Argentinian pesos and Mexican pesos. Accordingly, the Group’s financial results may be affected by exchange rate 
fluctuations between the US dollar and the local currency. The long-term relationship between commodity prices and currencies in the countries in which 
the Group operates provides a certain degree of natural protection. The Group does not use derivative instruments to manage its foreign currency risks.
The following table demonstrates the sensitivity of financial assets and liabilities, at the reporting date, denominated in their respective currencies, to a 
reasonably possible change in the US dollar exchange rate, with all other variables held constant, of the Group’s profit before tax and the Group’s equity.

(c) Credit risk 
Credit risk arises from debtors’ inability to make payment of their obligations to the Group as they become due (without taking into account the fair value 
of any guarantee or pledged assets). The Group is primarily exposed to credit risk as a result of commercial activities and non compliance, by 
counterparties, in transactions in cash which are primarily limited to cash balances deposited in banks and accounts receivable at the statement of financial 
position date. 
Counterparty credit exposure based on commercial activities, including trade receivables, embedded derivatives and cash balances in banks as at

1 The long-term credit rating as at 6 February 2018 (2016: 31 January 2017). 
T o manage the credit risk associated with commercial activities, the Group took the following steps:
 – Active use of prepayment/advance clauses in sales contracts
 – Delaying delivery of title and/or requiring advance payments to reduce exposure timeframe (potential delay in sales recognition)
 – Obtaining parent guarantees or contracting directly with parent company to shore up the credit profile of the customer (where possible)
 – Maintaining as diversified a portfolio of clients as possible
T o manage credit risk associated with cash balances deposited in banks, the Group took the following steps:
 – Increasing banking relationships with large, established and well-capitalised institutions in order to secure access to credit and to diversify credit risk
 – Limiting exposure to financial counterparties according to Board approved limits
 – Investing cash in short-term, highly liquid and low risk instruments (money market accounts, term deposits, US T reasuries)
Receivable balances are monitored on an ongoing basis with the result that the Group’s exposure to bad debts is not significant. The maximum exposure is 
the carrying amount as disclosed in notes 20, 22 and 36(e). 
(d) Equity risk on financial instruments 
The Group acquires financial instruments in connection with strategic alliances with third parties. The Group constantly monitors the fair value of these 
instruments in order to decide whether or not it is convenient to dispose of these investments. The disposal decision is also based on management’s 
intention to continue with the strategic alliance, the tax implications and changes in the share price of the investee. 
At 31 December 2017 the sensitivity to reasonable movements in the share price of available-for-sale financial assets of +/- 25% with all other variables held 
constant is +/-US$1,421,000 recognised in equity. The amount held of investments at 31 December 2016 (note 19) is not significant and the sensitivity to 
reasonable movements in the share price of available-for-sale financial assets is immaterial.

Hochschild Mining plc 138 (e) Fair value hierarchy 
The Group uses the following hierarchy for determining and disclosing the fair value of financial instruments by valuation technique:
Level 1: quoted (unadjusted) prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
Level 2: other techniques for which all inputs which have a significant effect on the recorded fair value are observable, either directly or indirectly. 
Level 3: techniques which use inputs which have a significant effect on the recorded fair value that are not based on observable market data.
As at 31 December 2017 and 2016, the Group held the following financial instruments measured at fair value:

1  Sales of concentrate and certain gold and silver volumes are provisionally priced at the time the sale is recorded. The price is then adjusted after an agreed period of time (usually linked to the length of time it 
takes for the smelter to refine and sell the concentrate or for the refiner to process the doré into gold and silver), with the Group either paying or receiving the difference between the provisional price and the 
final price. This price exposure is considered to be an embedded derivative in accordance with IAS 39 ‘Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement’. The gain or loss that arises on the fair value of the 
embedded derivative is recorded in ‘Revenue’ (note 5). 
During the period ending 31 December 2017 and 2016, there were no transfers between these levels.
The reconciliation of the financial instruments categorised as level 3 is as follows:

(f) Liquidity risk 
Liquidity risk arises from the Group’s inability to obtain the funds it requires to comply with its commitments, including the inability to sell a financial asset 
quickly enough and at a price close to its fair value. Management constantly monitors the Group’s level of short- and medium-term liquidity, and their 
access to credit lines, in order to ensure appropriate financing is available for its operations.
The table below categorises the undiscounted cash flows of Group’s financial liabilities into relevant maturity groupings based on the remaining period as at

(g) Interest rate risk 
The Group has financial assets and liabilities which are exposed to interest rate risk. Changes in interest rates primarily impact loans and borrowings by 
changing either their fair value (fixed rate debt) or their future cash flows (variable rate debt). The Group does not have a formal policy of determining 
how much of its exposure should be at fixed or at variable rates. However, at the time of taking new loans or borrowings, management applies its 
judgement to decide whether it believes that a fixed or variable rate borrowing would be more favourable to the Group over the expected period  
until maturity.

Interest on financial instruments classified as floating rate is re-priced at intervals of less than one year. Interest on financial instruments classified as fixed 
rate is fixed until the maturity of the instrument. The other financial instruments of the Group that are not included in the above tables are non-interest 
bearing and are therefore not subject to interest rate risk. 
The sensitivity to a reasonable movement in the interest rate, with all other variables held constant, of the financial instruments with a floating rate, 
determined as a +/-50bps change in interest rates has a +/-14,000 effect on profit before tax (2016: +/-6,000). The Group is exposed to fluctuations in 
market interest rates. 
This assumes that the amount remains unchanged from that in place at 31 December 2017 and 2016 and that the change in interest rates is effective from 
the beginning of the year. In reality, the floating rate will fluctuate over the year and interest rates will change accordingly. 
(h) Capital risk management 
The Group’s objectives when managing capital are to safeguard the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern in order to provide returns for 
shareholders, benefits for other stakeholders, and to maintain an optimal capital structure to reduce the cost of capital. Management considers as part of 
its capital, the financial sources of funding from shareholders and third parties (notes 25 and 27).
In 2017 the Group collected US$69,500,000 (2016: US$70,000,000) due to proceeds of borrowings while US$38,000,000 (2016: US$177,431,000) of 
debt was repaid.
Management also retains the right to fund operations (fully owned and with joint venture partners) with a mix of equity and joint venture partners’ debt.
37 Subsequent events
(a)  A restructuring plan has been established for the Arcata mining unit that includes the dismissal of approximately 165 employees. This reduction is 
aligned with the exploitation plan 2018, which is lower than budgeted in 2017, and is scheduled to take place between the months of January and 
February 2018. The process has been co-ordinated and communicated during January 2018 to the employees and the union. The approximate cost 
associated with the indemnities is estimated to be around US$1,388,000.
(b)  On 23 January 2018 the Group redeemed in full all of the US$294,775,000 outstanding principal amount of the Senior Unsecured Notes of Compañía 
Minera Ares S.A.C. (refer to note 25 (a)). The redemption price was US$317,620,062, that includes the principal amount of US$294,775,000, the 
total amount of unpaid interests of US$11,422,531 and a premium of US$11,422,531.
(c)  On 10 January 2018 the Group signed a short-term loan with Nova Scotia Bank of US$50,000,000 (3 months LIBOR plus 0.32%) and on 17 January 
2018 signed a medium-term loan with Nova Scotia Bank of US$100,000,000 (3 months LIBOR plus 0.70%). The proceeds were employed to redeem 
the Senior Unsecured Notes of Compañia Minera Ares S.A.C.
(d) On 2 January 2018 the Group issued 1,660,805 ordinary shares under the Restricted Share Plan, to certain employees of the Group.

Further information 1 Corporate information 
Hochschild Mining plc (hereinafter ‘the Company’) is a public limited company incorporated on 11 April 2006 under the Companies Act 1985 as a Limited 
Company and registered in England and Wales with registered number 05777693.
The Company’s registered office is located at 17 Cavendish Square, London W1G 0PH, United Kingdom. The Company was incorporated to serve as a 
holding company to be listed on the London Stock Exchange. The Company acquired its interest in a group of companies to constitute the Hochschild 
Mining Group (‘the Group’) pursuant to a share exchange agreement (‘Share Exchange Agreement’) dated 2 November 2006. 
The ultimate controlling party of the Company is Mr Eduardo Hochschild whose beneficial interest in the Company and its subsidiaries (together ‘the 
Group’ or ‘Hochschild Mining Group’) is held through Pelham Investment Corporation, a Cayman Islands company.
On 8 November 2006, the Company’s shares were admitted to the Official List of the UKLA (United Kingdom Listing Authority) and to trading on the 
London Stock Exchange. 
2 Significant accounting policies 
(a) Basis of preparation 
The Company’s financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted by the 
European Union and are also consistent with IFRS issued by the IASB, as applied in accordance with the Companies Act 2006. 
The financial statements of the Company have been prepared on a historical cost basis. The financial statements are presented in US dollars (US$) and all 
monetary amounts are rounded to the nearest thousand ($000) except when otherwise indicated. 
(b) Going concern
The ability for the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent on Hochschild Mining Holdings Limited providing additional funding to the extent 
that the operating inflows of the Company are insufficient to meet future cash requirements. As Hochschild Mining Holdings Limited has committed to 
provide this support, is itself a going concern and can provide financial support if necessary, the Directors have prepared the financial statements for the 
Company on the going concern basis.
(c) Exemptions 
The Company’s financial statements are included in the Hochschild Mining Group consolidated financial statements for the years ended 31 December 2017 
and 31 December 2016. As permitted by section 408 of the Companies Act 2006, the Company has not presented its own profit and loss account. 
(d) Judgements in applying accounting policies and key sources of estimation uncertainty 
Certain amounts included in the financial statements such as the impairment in subsidiaries involve the use of judgement and/or estimation. These 
judgements and estimates are based on management’s best knowledge of the relevant facts and circumstances, having regard to prior experience, but 
actual results may differ from the amounts included in the financial statements. Information about such judgements and estimation is contained in the 
accounting policies and/or the notes to the financial statements. 
(e) Changes in accounting policy and disclosures 
The accounting policies adopted in the preparation of the financial statements are consistent with those applied in the preparation of the consolidated 
financial statement for the year ended 31 December 2017. Amendments to standards and interpretations which came into force during the year did not 
have a significant impact on the financial statements. The accounting policies adopted are consistent with those of the previous financial year.
(f) Currency translation 
The functional currency of the Company is the US dollar and is determined by the currency of the primary economic environment in which it operates. 
T ransactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the Company are initially recorded in the functional currency using the 
exchange rate ruling at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are remeasured at the rate of 
exchange ruling at the statement of financial position date. Exchange gains and losses on settlement of foreign currency transactions which are translated 
at the rate prevailing at the date of the transactions, or on the translation of monetary assets and liabilities which are translated at period-end exchange 
rates, are taken to the income statement. Non monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies that are stated at historical cost are 
translated to the functional currency at the foreign exchange rate prevailing at the date of the transaction. 
(g) Investments in subsidiaries 
Subsidiaries are entities over which the Company controls operating and financial policies, generally by owning more than 50% of voting rights. Investments 
in subsidiaries are recognised at acquisition cost less any provision for impairment. The Company assesses investments for impairment whenever events or 
changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an investment may not be recoverable. If any such indication of impairment exists, the 
Company makes an estimate of its recoverable amount. Where the carrying amount of an investment exceeds its recoverable amount, the investment is 
considered impaired and is written down to its recoverable amount. If, in subsequent periods, the amount of the impairment loss decreases and the 
decrease can be related objectively to an event occurring after the impairment was recognised, the previously recognised impairment loss is reversed. Any 
subsequent reversal of an impairment loss is recognised in the profit and loss account, to the extent that the carrying value of the asset does not exceed its 
amortised cost at the reversal date.
(h) Dividends receivable 
Dividends are recognised when the Company’s right to receive payments is established. Dividends received are recorded in the income statement. 
Notes to the parent company financial statements 
For the year ended 31 December 2017
Annual Report & Accounts 2017 
Hochschild Mining plc 144 (i) Other receivables 
Current receivables are carried at the original amount less provision made for impairment of these receivables. A provision for impairment of receivables is 
established when there is objective evidence that the Company will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the original terms of the receivable. 
The amount of the provision is the difference between the original carrying amount and the recoverable amount and this difference is recognised in the 
income statement. 
(j) Cash and cash equivalents 
Cash and cash equivalents are carried in the statement of financial position at cost. For the purposes of the statement of financial position, cash and cash 
equivalents comprise cash in hand and deposits held with banks that are readily convertible into known amounts of cash within three months or less and 
which are subject to insignificant risk of changes in value. For the purposes of the cash flow statement, cash and cash equivalents as defined above are 
shown net of outstanding bank overdrafts. 
(k) Share capital 
Ordinary shares are classified as equity. Any excess above the par value of shares received upon issuance of those shares is classified as share premium. In 
the case the excess above par value is available for distribution, it is classified as merger reserve and then transferred to retained earnings.
(l) Provisions 
Provisions are recognised when the Company has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past event, it is probable that an outflow of 
resources will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation. If the effect of the time value of 
money is material, provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of 
the time value of money and, where appropriate, the risks specific to the liability. Where discounting is used, the increase in the provision due to the 
passage of time is recognised as a finance cost.
(m) Share-based payments 
Cash-settled transactions
The fair value of cash-settled share plans is recognised as a liability over the vesting period of the awards. Movements in that liability between reporting 
dates are recognised as personnel expenses. The fair value of the awards is taken to be the market value of the shares at the date of award adjusted by a 
factor for anticipated relative TSR performance. Fair values are subsequently remeasured at each reporting date to reflect the number of awards expected 
to vest based on the current and anticipated TSR performance. 
Equity-settled transactions
The cost of equity-settled transactions is recognised, together with a corresponding increase in other reserves in equity, over the period in which the 
performance and/or service conditions are fulfilled. The cumulative expense recognised for equity-settled transactions at each reporting date until the 
vesting date reflects the extent to which the vesting period has expired and the Company’s best estimate of the number of equity instruments that vest. 
The income statement expense for a period represents the movement in cumulative expense recognised as at the beginning and end of that period and is 
recognised in personnel expenses.
(n) Finance income and costs 
Finance income and costs mainly comprise interest income on funds invested, interest expense on borrowings, foreign exchange gains and losses, gains 
and losses from the change in fair value of derivative instruments and gains and losses on the disposal of available-for-sale investments. Interest income and 
costs are recognised as they accrue, taking into account the effective yield on the asset and liability, respectively. 
(o) Income tax 
Income tax for the year comprises current and deferred tax. Income tax is recognised in the income statement except to the extent that it relates to items 
charged or credited directly to equity, in which case it is recognised in equity. 
Current tax expense is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year, using tax rates enacted at the statement of financial position date, and 
any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years. 
Deferred tax is provided using the balance sheet liability method, providing for temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities 
for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes with the following exemptions: 
 – where the temporary difference arises from the initial recognition of goodwill or of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination 
that at the time of the transaction affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss; 
 – in respect of taxable temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures, where the timing of the reversal of 
the temporary differences can be controlled and it is probable that the temporary differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply to the period when the asset is realised or the liability is settled 
based on the tax rates (and tax laws) that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the statement of financial position date. 
A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the asset can be utilised. 
Deferred tax assets are reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that the related tax benefit will be realised.

(p) Financial instruments 
Financial assets and liabilities are recognised when the Company becomes party to the contracts that give rise to them and are classified as loans or 
borrowings, receivables, payables, financial instruments at fair value through profit and loss or as available-for sale financial assets, as appropriate. The 
Company determines the classification of its financial assets and liabilities at initial recognition and, where allowed and appropriate, re-evaluates this 
designation at each financial year-end. When financial assets and liabilities are recognised initially, they are measured at fair value, being the transaction 
price plus, in the case of financial assets not at fair value through profit or loss and borrowings, directly attributable transaction costs. The Company 
considers whether a contract contains an embedded derivative when the entity first becomes a party to it. The embedded derivatives are separated from 
the host contract if it is not measured at fair value through profit or loss and when the economic characteristics and risks are not closely related to those of 
the host contract. Reassessment only occurs if there is a change in the terms of the contract that significantly modifies the cash flows that would otherwise 
be required. 
All regular way purchases and sales of financial assets are recognised on the trade date, being the date that the Company commits to purchase or sell the 
asset. Regular way transactions require delivery and receipt of assets within the timeframe generally established by regulation or convention in the 
marketplace. 
Financial guarantees
Financial guarantees are guarantees provided by the Company on behalf of one of the Group’s subsidiaries. At inception the fair value of a financial 
guarantee is determined and recognised as a liability in the Company’s accounts, while the debit is recognised as a capital contribution to its subsidiary. The 
liability is subsequently amortised on a straight-line basis over the life of the guarantee, unless it is considered probable that the guarantee will be called, in 
which case it is measured at the value of the guaranteed amount payable, if higher.
The liability is presented within creditors as ‘Financial liability – financial guarantee’. 
Loans and borrowings 
Borrowings are recognised initially at fair value. After initial recognition, interest bearing loans and borrowings are subsequently measured at amortised 
cost using the effective interest rate method. 
Gains and losses are recognised in the income statement when the liabilities are derecognised as well as through the amortisation process. 
Borrowings are classified as current liabilities unless the Group has an unconditional right to defer settlement of the liability for at least 12 months after the 
statement of financial position date.
A detailed description of the Company’s policies in respect of financial instruments is included in the Group’s financial statements (note 2(t)). 
(q) Dividends distribution 
Dividend distribution to the Company’s shareholders is recognised as a liability in the Company’s financial statements in the period in which the dividends 
are approved by the Company’s shareholders.
3 Profit and loss account
The Company made a profit attributable to equity shareholders of US$487,315,000 (2016: US$1,199,842,000).
4 Property, plant and equipment
At 31 December 2017 and 2016 the Company has property, plant and equipment with cost of equipment of US$265,000 which is fully depreciated.
There were no additions during 2016 and 2017.

The Company tested its investment in subsidiary for impairment in light of increases in the prices of gold and silver, as well as increases in the Company’s 
publicly listed share price. As a result of this test, the Company recognised an impairment reversal of the investment in Hochschild Mining Holdings Ltd. of 
US$491,285,000 (2016: US$1,202,604,000).
The recoverable value of the investment in Hochschild Mining Holdings Limited was determined using a fair value less costs of disposal. The fair value less 
costs of disposal was determined with reference to the market capitalisation of the Group at 31 December 2017 and 2016 translated from Pounds Sterling 
into US dollars using the year-end exchange rate (both Level 1 inputs), to which a control premium was added based on recent market transactions (a 
Level 2 input), and subsequently adjusted for the net debt held directly by the Company. A Level 1 input refers to quoted prices in active markets, while a 
Level 2 input corresponds to other information that can be observed directly or indirectly. Any positive variation in the key assumptions would not have an 
impact on the impairment reversal recognised. Therefore, an adverse change of 10% of the market capitalisation would result in a reduction of the reversal 
of impairment by US$86,048,000.

13 Financial risk management 
The Company is exposed to a variety of risks and uncertainties which may have an impact on the achievement of financial and economic objectives. These 
risks include strategic, operational and financial risk and are further categorised into risk areas to facilitate risk assessment. 
The Company is not exposed to significant sources of commodity price, equity or interest rate risk. 
(a) Foreign currency risk 
Due to the operations of the Company, it has cash and cash equivalents and trade payables denominated in Pounds Sterling and Canadian dollars. 
Accordingly, the financial results of the Company may be affected by exchange rate fluctuations. The Company does not use derivative instruments to 
manage its foreign currency risks. The following table demonstrates the sensitivity of financial assets and liabilities, at the reporting date denominated in

(b) Credit risk 
The Company is primarily exposed to credit risk in transactions in cash which are primarily limited to cash balances deposited in banks and accounts 
receivable at the statement of financial position date. The Company has evaluated and introduced efforts to try to mitigate credit risk exposure. 
T o manage credit risk associated with cash balances deposited in banks, the Company is: 
 – increasing banking relationships with large, established and well-capitalised institutions in order to secure access to credit and to diversify credit risk;
 – investing cash in short-term, highly liquid and low risk instruments (term deposits); and
 – maintaining excess cash abroad in hard currency.
Credit risk concentrations exist when changes in economic, industrial or geographic factors take place, affecting in the same manner the Company’s 
counterparties whose added risk exposure is significant to the Company’s total credit exposure. Receivable balances are monitored on an ongoing basis 
with the result that the Company’s exposure to bad debts is not significant. The maximum exposure is the carrying amount as disclosed in note 6. 
(c) Liquidity risk 
Liquidity risk arises from the Company’s inability to obtain the funds it requires to comply with its commitments, including the inability to sell a financial 
asset quickly enough and at a price close to its fair value. Management constantly monitors the Company’s level of short- and medium-term liquidity and 
their access to credit lines on reasonable terms in order to ensure appropriate financing is available for its operations.
The Company is funded by Hochschild Mining Holdings Ltd through loans in order to meet its obligations. Liquidity is supported by the balance of cash and 
cash equivalent held by the Company and Hochschild Mining Holdings Ltd at 31 December 2017 of US$2,182,000 (2016: US$10,402,000) and US$16,137,000 
(2016: US$17,218,000) respectively. The Company also serves as principal funding conduit for the Group’s capital raising activities such as equity issuances.

(d) Capital risk management 
The Company’s objectives when managing capital are to safeguard the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern in order to provide returns for 
shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders and to maintain an optimal capital structure to reduce the cost of capital. Management considers as part 
of its capital the financial sources of funding from shareholders and third parties (notes 8 and 9). In order to ensure an appropriate return for 
shareholders’ capital invested in the Company, management monitors capital thoroughly and evaluates all material projects and potential acquisitions 
before submission to the Board for ultimate approval, where applicable.

Hochschild Mining plc 152 Ore reserves and mineral resources estimates 
Hochschild Mining plc reports its mineral resources and reserves estimates in accordance with the Australasian Code for Reporting of Exploration Results, 
Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves 2004 edition (‘the JORC Code’). This establishes minimum standards, recommendations and guidelines for the public 
reporting of exploration results and mineral resources and reserves estimates. In doing so it emphasises the importance of principles of transparency, 
materiality and confidence. The information on ore reserves and mineral resources on pages 153 to 155 were prepared by or under the supervision of 
Competent Persons (as defined in the JORC Code). Competent Persons are required to have sufficient relevant experience and understanding of the style 
of mineralisation, types of deposits and mining methods in the area of activity for which they are qualified as a Competent Person under the JORC Code. 
The Competent Person must sign off their respective estimates of the original mineral resource and ore reserve statements for the various operations and 
consent to the inclusion of that information in this report, as well as the form and context in which it appears. 
Hochschild Mining plc employs its own Competent Person who has audited all the estimates set out in this report. Hochschild Mining Group companies are 
subject to a comprehensive programme of audits which aims to provide assurance in respect of ore reserve and mineral resource estimates. These audits 
are conducted by Competent Persons provided by independent consultants. The frequency and depth of an audit depends on the risks and/or 
uncertainties associated with that particular ore reserve and mineral resource, the overall value thereof and the time that has lapsed since the previous 
independent third party audit. 
The JORC Code requires the use of reasonable economic assumptions. These include long-term commodity price forecasts (which, in the Group’s case, 
are prepared by ex-house specialists largely using estimates of future supply and demand and long-term economic outlooks). 
Ore reserve estimates are dynamic and are influenced by changing economic conditions, technical issues, environmental regulations and any other relevant 
new information and therefore these can vary from year-to-year. Mineral resource estimates can also change and tend to be influenced mostly by new 
information pertaining to the understanding of the deposit and secondly the conversion to ore reserves. 
The estimates of ore reserves and mineral resources are shown as at 31 December 2017, unless otherwise stated. Mineral resources that are reported 
include those mineral resources that have been modified to produce ore reserves. All tonnage and grade information has been rounded to reflect the 
relative uncertainty in the estimates; there may therefore be small differences. The prices used for the reserves calculation were: Au Price: US$1,200 per 
ounce and Ag Price: US$16.5 per ounce.
