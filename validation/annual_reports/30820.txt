Alternative Performance Measures
The Group uses Alternative Performance Measures (APMs) as key financial performance indicators (KPIs) to assess underlying performance of the Group. The APMs used are widely used 
industry measures, form the measurement basis of the key strategic targets (return on net operating assets** and operating profit* margin) and are linked directly to executive remuneration. 
All references to adjusted operating profit or operating profit throughout this report meet the definition of an APM.
Definitions of the APMs discussed throughout this Annual Report and Accounts, and a reconciliation to the equivalent statutory measure, are detailed on pages 148 to 150.

taylorwimpey.co.uk Chairman’s Statement
Introduction
On behalf of your Board, I am delighted to report that we have made good 
progress on both our financial and operational metrics and delivered another 
year of growth in shareholder returns, with £451 million returned to 
shareholders in 2017 in total dividends. Group revenue for the year increased 
by 7.9% to £3,965.2 million (2016: £3,676.2 million) and we were pleased to 
report an operating profit* of £841.2 million, an increase of 10.1% year on year 
(2016: £764.3 million). More detailed information on our financial performance 
can be found on pages 42 to 45. During the year, we completed 
14,541 much-needed new homes in the UK, which represents a 4.8% growth 
on last year, whilst also continuing to make a significant contribution to the 
communities in which we operate, where we invested over £400 million 
through planning obligations. I am proud to report that since we implemented 
our strategy outlined in 2011, Taylor Wimpey has delivered nearly 87k new 
homes across the country and returned £1.2 billion to shareholders. 
The housing cycle
Trading performance and customer demand remained resilient throughout  
the year and in our core geographies. You can find more perspective on 
market conditions on pages 10 and 11. We recognise that the outcome of  
the General Election, combined with the on-going Brexit negotiations, has 
resulted in greater political uncertainty. We maintain and welcome an open 
and active dialogue with the Government and the main political parties. We 
are pleased to note that all the main parties understand the importance of 
housebuilding to the country. Whist we have not seen any adverse impact  
on the new build housing market or consumer confidence, we are monitoring 
both the consumer and political environment. We remain confident that our 
strategy, with a robust balance sheet, high-quality landbank and a highly 
experienced management team, provides the resilience and flexibility to 
enable us to deal with changing market conditions, as required, and to 
perform well through changing market conditions. More information on our 
strategy can be found on pages 20 and 21 and you will see the key themes 
reflected throughout this document, and importantly in our general approach 
to business.
Health and safety
Health and safety will always be our non-negotiable top priority and continues 
to be the first item discussed at every plc Board and regional board meeting 
throughout the business. It also remains one of the highest rated questions 
in our annual employee engagement survey, with 98% of employees believing 
Taylor Wimpey takes health and safety in the workplace seriously 
(2016: 98%). We are pleased to note our Annual Injury Incidence Rate (AIIR) 
for reportable injuries per 100,000 employees and contractors was a record 
low of 152 in 2017 (2016: 211) and our efforts and level of focus on health 
and safety will of course continue. More information can be found on pages 
28 to 30, including details of our own internal review following the tragic events 
at Grenfell Tower, London, in June 2017.
Customer service
Customer service continues to be a key priority for all Taylor Wimpey 
employees. You may recall that in last year’s Annual Report and Accounts, 
I advised that during 2016 we implemented several changes to our customer 
service approach. These included enhancing the structure of our customer 
service teams, through the creation of a new role of Head of Customer 
Service in each of our 24 regional businesses, which has helped our overall 
performance. During 2017, we worked hard throughout the business to instil 
A responsible

Taylor Wimpey plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Strategic Report and embed these new initiatives into our standard operating processes and 
culture. It is here that I would like to take the opportunity to thank each and 
every employee on behalf of our shareholders and the Board for all their efforts 
in this area. I have been impressed by the hard work and commitment shown 
by all of our teams. While we recognise that we don’t get everything right and 
there is still, of course, more work to do, it has been very pleasing to see a 
significant improvement in our customer satisfaction scores in recent months, 
which validates the investments and efforts we have made into enhancements 
in this area. We will be prioritising further improvements in customer service 
in 2018. 
It is, however, equally, if not more important, to acknowledge, reflect on and 
address situations where we have not always got it right. Following concern 
expressed by some customers, during 2017 we carried out a review of 
historic lease structures and, in particular, ten-year doubling ground rent 
clauses, which we had stopped using on new developments from late 2011. 
Whilst Taylor Wimpey implemented these leases in good faith and the terms 
were clearly set out in the relevant leases, it was clear from our review that  
the impact of these doubling rent review clauses was causing some of  
our customers understandable concern, particularly from a mortgageability 
and saleability perspective. We acknowledge that the introduction of these 
doubling clauses in 2007 was not consistent with our high standards of 
customer service and we have quite rightly apologised to customers for  
the unintended consequences and concern that we caused. In our Annual 
General Meeting trading update of April 2017, we announced that we  
would make a provision, before tax, of £130 million in the first half accounts  
to allow us to put things right for our affected customers. At the same time, 
we implemented, on a voluntary basis, the Taylor Wimpey Ground Rent 
Review Assistance Scheme, to enable us to work with the relevant freeholders 
who own the leases, in order to convert our customers’ ten-year doubling 
ground rent clauses to leases based on RPI, should they elect to participate 
in the Scheme. 
As part of our review, we also stopped selling houses on a leasehold basis  
on our new developments with effect from the start of 2017, other than in 
exceptional circumstances such as where Taylor Wimpey does not own  
the site on a freehold basis.
Charities and local community groups
We believe that as a responsible business, we must actively contribute to 
helping others whether financially, with our time, energy or expertise. We 
remain highly committed to supporting charities and local community groups 
in the areas in which we operate, and I am extremely proud to see the 
personal commitments our employees continue to make to our charitable 
partners. We aim to be an aspirational housebuilding brand that is recognised 
for the good that is given back to our local communities by both our 
employees and our business as a whole. Our primary goal is to genuinely 
improve the position of the causes that we support. The other goal is to 
engage our employees in these activities as we recognise it is good for their 
personal development and self-awareness. During 2017, it was pleasing to 
see many of our employees participate in our volunteering scheme, which 
allows employees to take paid time off to volunteer at one of our national 
charities. We hope to see an increasing number take advantage of this 
opportunity in 2018.

taylorwimpey.co.uk In addition to our planning obligations during 2017, we donated and 
fundraised over £1 million for registered charities (2016: over £875k). 
In addition, a further c.£90k was donated to other organisations (2016: 
c.£159k), sponsoring community events, local sports teams, social clubs and 
many other initiatives. More information can be found within our Sustainability 
Report 2017 which will be available on our website in March 2018.
Dividends
A key part of our investment proposition is our commitment to a reliable 
dividend stream for our investors through the housing market cycle. 
Subject to shareholder approval each year, the Company will pay an ordinary 
dividend of approximately 5% of Group net assets which will be at least 
£150 million in dividends per annum. This is intended to provide a reliable 
minimum annual return to shareholders throughout the cycle. This Ordinary 
Dividend Policy was subject to prudent and comprehensive stress testing 
against various downside scenarios, which also included a reduction of 20% 
in average selling prices and a 30% reduction in volumes. 
The payment of ordinary dividends will continue to be supplemented by 
additional significant special dividends at appropriate times in the cycle.  
Our Special Dividend Policy will pay out to shareholders the free cash 
generated by the Group after land investment, all working capital, taxation  
and other cash requirements of the business in executing our strategy in  
the medium term, and once the Group’s ordinary dividends have been met.
Subject to shareholder approval the 2017 final ordinary dividend of c.2.44 
pence per share will be paid on 18 May 2018 to shareholders on the register 
at the close of business on 6 April 2018 (2016 final dividend: 2.29 pence 
per share). In combination with the interim dividend of 2.30 pence per share 
(2016 interim dividend: 0.53 pence per share) this gives a total ordinary 
dividend for the year of c.4.74 pence per share (2016 ordinary dividend: 
2.82 pence per share).
This dividend will be paid as a cash dividend, and shareholders are once again 
being offered the opportunity to reinvest all of their ordinary dividend under the 
Dividend Re-Investment Plan (DRIP), details of which are available from our 
Registrar and on our website. Elections to join the Plan must reach the 
Registrar by 26 April 2018 in order to be effective for this dividend. Further 
details can be found on our website www.taylorwimpey.co.uk/corporate
In addition, on 14 July 2017, we returned £300.5 million to shareholders  
by way of a special dividend, equating to 9.2 pence per ordinary share.  
As previously announced in August 2017 we intend to return c.£340 million  
to shareholders in July 2018, equating to 10.4 pence per ordinary share, 
subject to shareholder approval at the Annual General Meeting (AGM). This is 
proposed to be paid on 13 July 2018 as a cash dividend to all shareholders 
on the register at close of business on 1 June 2018. Shareholders will be 
offered the opportunity to reinvest all of their 2018 special cash dividend under 
the DRIP, for which elections to join the Plan must reach the Registrar by 
22 June 2018.
The Board confirms its intention to keep the mechanics of how the Company 
will pay special dividends, including the merits of undertaking a share buyback 
at some point in the future should it become appropriate to do so, under 
regular review. 
Corporate Governance
We are and remain committed to good corporate governance and believe 
that integrity and transparency are key to attaining this. Corporate governance 
is embedded at every level within the business and is a reflection of our core 
values and culture, policies, and relationships with all of our stakeholders. 
A key part of good corporate governance is ensuring the Board which 
governs has the necessary balance and skills which are both relevant and 
complementary, and can benefit the Board and the business with their 
experience, background and diversity. More information about each Director 
can be found within the biographies on pages 46 and 47. I was delighted to 
announce in January that after a rigorous process, we appointed Gwyn Burr 
to the Board as an Independent Non-Executive Director, with effect from  
1 February 2018. Gwyn has excellent and relevant experience gained from 
both her previous executive experience, primarily focused on customer 
service, and also from her more recent non-executive roles and we very much 
look forward to working with her. We also announced that Rob Rowley will 
stand down from the Board following the AGM on 26 April 2018. I would like 
to again express both my and the Board’s gratitude for Rob’s long and valued 
contribution to the Board over the past eight years, including both as the 
Company’s Senior Independent Director and as Chair of the Audit Committee. 
Dame Kate Barker will succeed Rob as the Board’s Senior Independent 
Director, following the AGM, and as planned, Humphrey Singer succeeded 
Rob as the Chairman of the Audit Committee in January 2018. 
The annual Board Evaluation is an important exercise and one that your  
Board as a whole and individually takes very seriously. In line with the UK 
Governance Code, we ensure that the Evaluation is externally facilitated at 
least once every three years, and is conducted internally in intervening years 
and formally facilitated by myself and the Company Secretary. The 2017 
Evaluation was externally facilitated by Manchester Square Partners (MSP) 
and I am pleased to report that the outcome of the review concluded that the 
Board is still functioning well, with a high degree of mutual trust, respect and 
integrity whilst being open, straight-talking and challenging in nature. It was 
also pleasing to note that MSP found that the Board operated with first class 
governance. There were inevitably some areas for improvement and additional 
focus and these are already being addressed by the Board. Further details of 
the outcome of the Evaluation and how it was conducted are set out in the 
Corporate Governance section of this report on page 61.
I would also like to touch on executive remuneration: last year, following  
our usual constructive consultation with our shareholders, our Remuneration 
Policy received very strong support at the 2017 AGM, for which we are very 
grateful. This enabled the Company, via the Remuneration Committee, to take 
into account a number of views and perspectives to put in place an 
appropriate remuneration framework having regard to a number of factors 
including: the overall economic and market environment as well as the 
Company’s strategy and targets. 
During 2017, we published our first Modern Slavery Statement in line with 
statutory requirements, and we will publish our second statement in 2018.  
We strongly support the legislation and do not tolerate any form of slavery, 
forced labour or human trafficking in our business or in our supply chain. I am 
pleased to confirm that our risk assessment found that in general the risk of 
modern slavery occurring in our business or supply chain is low. However, 
there are some higher risk areas in the supply chain and we will be engaging 
with the suppliers in these areas to make sure they have the right policies and 
strategies in place to mitigate these risks. We have a Modern Slavery Act 
working group, chaired by our Group Legal Director and Company Secretary, 
which oversees our approach.
“ 
Corporate governance is embedded 
at every level within the business and 
is a reflection of our core values and 
culture, policies, and relationships 
with all our stakeholders.

People
We believe in investing in our people and in developing our internal ‘bench’ 
and future pipeline of talent as this is key to ensuring their future success and, 
in turn, that of Taylor Wimpey. The Nomination Committee plays a key role in 
the oversight of our progress in this regard. An important part of our approach 
is a continued investment in the skills and development of our employees 
across the business, as we work to ensure that Taylor Wimpey attracts and 
retains the best people in the industry through the cycle. It was therefore 
particularly pleasing to be ranked as one of Glassdoor’s ‘Top 20 Best 
Companies To Work For’ in the UK. This is based solely on employee and 
former employee feedback and is therefore an important external benchmark. 
In 2017, we undertook an employee engagement survey with an 
encouragingly high participation rate of 72%. We were impressed with the 
overall results and very high level of engagement across the whole business. 
We were pleased to see improved scores in customer service, flexible 
working, as well as training and benefits package. Perhaps more importantly, 
it also identified areas, such as better collaboration between some functions, 
where further work is needed and we will of course prioritise these areas 
in 2018. 
As part of the Government’s welcomed employee voice initiative, during  
2017 we established our National Employee Forum (NEF) with elected 
representatives from across the business. The main objective of the NEF, 
which has already met on two occasions, will be to gather employee feedback 
on individual topics important to the business and share it with the relevant 
members of the senior management team – and of course vice versa. The 
NEF will build upon the existing regional Employee Consultative Committee 
structure to enhance the dialogue between the Board, Group Management 
Team and our employees. Kate Barker, as Chairman of the Remuneration 
Committee, and I will be attending the Forum from time to time, in addition to 
the Group Legal Director and Company Secretary, the Group HR Director  
and other senior management.

Team on page 17.
Diversity
We value diversity in every sense at Taylor Wimpey and aim to be an inclusive 
employer attracting, retaining and promoting employees from all backgrounds. 
This contributes to creativity and innovation in our workforce, widens our talent 
pool, boosts employee engagement, helps us to better reflect our customer 
base and ultimately improves our decision-making. Whilst we have made 
great strides since setting up our Diversity and Inclusivity Steering Committee, 
we recognise there is more to do and we are committed to improving further. 
All our senior leaders have attended our Open Minds diversity training course 
and from 2018, we will extend this further and all new employees will 
complete an e-learning module on diversity and inclusion as part of their 
induction. During 2017 we also held networking sessions for senior women in 
our business to meet with Group Management Team members and share 
experiences and insights. 
Outlook
We are confident that we can adapt to changing market conditions from a 
position of strength and perform well, underpinning our value proposition to 
shareholders and other stakeholders. Reflecting on the good progress made 
in 2017 and the lessons learnt, the Taylor Wimpey team is looking forward to 
the challenges and opportunities that 2018 will bring. 
I have already thanked all of our employees earlier in this Statement, so I 
would like to end by thanking all of our customers, shareholders and other 
stakeholders for their ongoing support.

taylorwimpey.co.uk Our place in the UK market
New housebuilding accounts for 10-15% of 
the total housing market. We are one of the 
largest residential developers in the UK, 
building nearly 15k homes in 2017 across 
Scotland, England and Wales.
Our key market drivers
We operate in a cyclical market, where 
factors such as customer confidence and 
mortgage cost inevitably have a direct 
impact on the short term outlook. A key part 
of managing through the cycle is the need 
to continually monitor market conditions 
using external indicators. These help us 
assess where we are in the cycle and, whilst 
we will not always get this right, we can 
adapt our tactics accordingly.
UK market outlook
We have been encouraged by early trading 
patterns at the start of the year and despite 
some wider macroeconomic uncertainty, 
customer confidence remains robust and 
market fundamentals are solid.
Customers continue to benefit from a 
competitive mortgage market and 
continued low interest rates. Help to Buy is 
a key differentiator for new build housing 
and remains popular with customers, 
enabling them to take the first step onto or 
move up the housing ladder. Customer 
demand and pricing in Central London 
remain stable.
How we are positioned
We have made a good start to 2018 and 
are encouraged by solid levels of demand 
coming into the spring selling season. The 
fundamentals for new build housing in the 
UK remain good with strong customer 
confidence in our core geographies. 
Whilst we have seen no adverse impact on 
trading, we are conscious of the wider 
political and economic risks.
We are confident that our well-capitalised 
balance sheet together with our high-quality 
landbank with outlets located in places 
where demand is high and where people 
want to live provides the flexibility and 
resilience needed to manage all types of 
market conditions through the cycle.
Taking a proactive approach to managing through the cycle 
Understanding 
our markets 
Government policy and 
planning
Both the 2017 Budget and the Housing White 
Paper in February 2017 recognised the 
importance of housing to the UK and the part all 
housebuilders can play in the economy. We 
broadly welcome the measures set out in the 
White Paper which are balanced and aim to 
sustainably increase the delivery of much-
needed homes.
We welcome the commissioning of the 
independent Hackitt Review on building 
regulations and fire safety, following the tragic  
fire at Grenfell Tower in June 2017. We look 
forward to working positively with Government 
and other agencies to ensure that the outcomes 
are effective and appropriate for the long term.
Help to Buy remains a popular purchasing tool 
for our customers, and the new build housing 
market more widely. The Government 
announcement in the Autumn regarding further 
funding for Help to Buy provided clarity for the 
period up to 2021, although we still await an 
update from the Government on the future of the 
Help to Buy scheme in the period after 2021. We 
reflect and account for the current uncertainty on 
the long term future of Help to Buy within our 
business planning.
Planning has historically been a constraint on 
the ability of the industry to build a sufficient 
number of new homes. We believe that the 
land market and planning environment have 
significantly changed over recent years. Whilst 
the planning process remains complex and is 
often slow, there is better clarity in many local 
authority areas and a better supply of suitable 
land that has good planning prospects with 
reduced competition.

EU Referendum implications
Despite the initial concerns in the immediate 
aftermath of the Referendum, we have continued 
to experience robust customer demand in the 
period since the UK’s vote to leave the European 
Union (EU) in 2016. Our initial reaction to the 
Referendum result in 2016 was to reflect our 
caution and uncertainty on its impact, by 
increasing our required investment margin and 
return expectations on new land acquisitions. 
There has, however, been no negative  
impact to the land market following the  
EU Referendum result.
We have experienced no material change in build  
cost inflation patterns since the EU Referendum  
result. Throughout 2017 there were increases in 
underlying build cost (excluding house type mix 
impact) of c. 3.5%, largely due to continued 
pressure on resources to deliver the higher level  
of homebuilding. We do not foresee any material 
change in either the supply or pricing of labour and 
materials in 2018, and forecast another year of 
overall build cost inflation of around 3-4%.

Taylor Wimpey plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Strategic Report Wider housing market
There continues to be a fundamental demand and supply imbalance in new 
build housing, with the Government stating in the 2017 Budget its intent to 
increase new supply in England to 300k by the mid 2020s.
Through 2017, demand for new build housing has remained robust 
supported by healthy employment trends, a competitive mortgage market 
and the Government’s Help to Buy scheme. The Help to Buy scheme 
continues to be a differentiator for new build housing, and remains a useful 
and popular product for our customers. Help to Buy was used in c.43% of 
total sales in 2017. 
Overall housing transactions in the second hand market remained more 
subdued on average over the year.
Whilst there were some regional variations, we saw generally strong demand 
throughout 2017 and the UK housing market remained resilient. Trading in 
Central London was stable, with customer confidence improving through the 
year, while the outer London market remained robust.

Mortgage availability and affordability
Mortgage availability and affordability in the UK is a key dynamic for the 
housebuilding sector and our customers.
Despite a modest increase in the Bank of England base rate of 0.25% in 
November 2017, the first increase in the last decade, borrowing costs remain 
at a low level when considered in a long term historical context. The availability 
of mortgage credit remains good with a healthy level of competition amongst 
lenders. We believe the financial attraction of purchasing a house relative to 
rental costs (of an equivalent house) remains compelling.
Commentary from the Bank of England after the November 2017 base rate 
increase indicated its expectation of only modest further increases in the 
coming years, so we do not currently envisage any material change in the 
overall conditions in the mortgage market in the near term.
The tighter lending requirements, introduced in 2014 as part of the Mortgage 
Market Review, continued to help ensure that monthly payments remained 
affordable, aiding the stability of the market.

2017 has been another strong year 
for Taylor Wimpey as we made good 
progress towards our medium term 
financial targets and improved our 
operational performance.
”
2017 was another strong year for Taylor Wimpey and we enter 2018 in a 
good position with positive forward momentum. We have been encouraged 
by early trading patterns at the start of the year and despite some wider 
macroeconomic uncertainty, consumer confidence remains robust and 
market fundamentals are solid. 
We grew volumes to nearly 15,000 homes during the year and are focused  
on delivering much-needed homes across the UK to the highest quality and 
standard. Importantly, we are pleased to see that our investment in customer 
service has resulted in a notable improvement in our customer 
satisfaction scores.
Group financial summary
Group revenue increased by 7.9% to £3,965.2 million in 2017 
(2016: £3,676.2 million) from 14,688 completions (2016: 14,112). The 
increase was driven by increased completions and improved selling prices 
in the UK. We delivered a gross profit for the year of £1,033.0 million 
(2016: £939.9 million), 9.9% up on the prior year and a profit, before 
exceptional items, for the year of £660.3 million (2016: £589.7 million),  
12.0% up on the prior year due to the improvement in the operational  
result, lower net finance costs and lower effective tax rate. Profit for the year 
was £555.3 million (2016: £589.3 million). This represents improved underlying 
trading offset by the exceptional provision recognised in the year in relation to 
the leasehold review. More information on our financial performance can be 
found within our Group Financial Review on pages 42 to 45.
UK operational performance summary
Whilst there were some regional variations, we saw generally strong demand 
throughout 2017 and the UK housing market remained resilient. Trading in 
Central London was stable, with customer confidence improving through the 
year, while the outer London market remained robust. We traded on an 
average of eight Central London schemes in 2017, of which the average size 
was 118 plots.
In 2017, total UK home completions (including joint ventures) increased by 
4.8% to 14,541 (2016: 13,881). During 2017, we delivered 2,809 affordable 
homes, including joint ventures, (2016: 2,690), equating to 19.3% of total 
completions (2016: 19.4%). Our net private reservation rate for the year was 
0.77 homes per outlet per week (2016: 0.72). 
Private cancellation rates for the year remained low at 13% (2016: 13%). 
Average selling prices on private completions increased by 3.5% to £296k 
(2016: £286k), once again benefiting from our focus on better quality locations 
and the improvement of specification in line with product and location. Our 
total average selling price increased by 3.5% to £264k (2016: £255k). We 
estimate that market-led house price growth for our regional mix was c.4% in 
the 12 months to 31 December 2017 (2016: 5%).

Taylor Wimpey plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Strategic Report First time buyers accounted for 41% of total sales in 2017 (2016: 38%). 
Investor sales continued to be at a very low level of c.3% (2016: 3%). 
During 2017, approximately 43% of total sales used the Help to Buy scheme, 
and we worked with 6,069 households to take the first step to home 
ownership or to move up the housing ladder (2016: 39% and 5,393). 
Approximately 77% of sales through Help to Buy in 2017 were to first time 
buyers (2016: 77%). During the year 27% of sales in the London market used 
Help to Buy London, which launched in February 2016.
During 2017, we opened 109 new high-quality outlets (2016: 105) in  
locations in villages, towns and cities where people want to live, and  
which are supported by strong demographics and local economies.  
As at 31 December 2017 we were operating from 278 outlets 
(31 December 2016: 285).
As at 31 December 2017 our order book represented 7,136 homes 
(31 December 2016: 7,567 homes) with a value of £1,628 million 
(31 December 2016: £1,682 million), excluding joint ventures. The order  
book remains strong, and has fallen slightly year on year, as we increased  
the pace of production throughout 2017.
Group strategy and returns
We believe that a long term view and a proactive approach are needed to 
deliver value through the housing cycle and in the wider environment in  
which we operate. Key to this approach is our management of risk,  
which protects shareholder value whilst still enabling us to take advantage  
of opportunities and drive further growth from the business.
We have remained disciplined in building and optimising a short term 
landbank of c.75k plots, of which 52% is strategically sourced, in the relatively 
balanced land market we have experienced since 2011. We have added in 
excess of 57k potential plots to the strategic pipeline since 2013, at a reduced 
cost and which, importantly, continues to give us increased flexibility and 
choices. Given this strength and quality of the landbank, we are focused on 
delivering value and maximising returns from our investments. We believe we 
can continue to drive further value from our landbank and our business model, 
as we focus on our customers, delivery and efficiency and also increased 
cash generation.
We believe that financial results must be achieved in the right way and as a 
responsible business we acknowledge both our obligations to the 
communities we operate in and the opportunity to work with our stakeholders 
to create value together. We will be hosting a Strategy Day in May 2018, 
where we will update the market on our views of long term strategy.
Medium term targets
Our targets are set to be stretching, and we are pleased to have made good 
progress against both our financial targets and operational metrics, since we 
set out our medium term targets in 2016. 
These targets sit within our long term strategy, ensuring we are focused on 
operational efficiency as well as strategic investments. We believe these to be 
the best medium term measures. They target further improvement across 
three key areas in the period from 2016 to 2018:
 – An average annual return on net operating assets** of 30%
 – An average operating profit* margin of c.22%
 – A total of £1.3 billion of dividends to be paid in cash to shareholders over 
the period
More information on our medium term targets and how they link through to 
our long term strategy can be found on pages 20 and 21.
With a total dividend of c.£500 million to be paid in 2018, subject to 
shareholder approvals, the Group is on track to meet its target to pay 
£1.3 billion in dividends in total for the 2016-18 period. The return on net 
operating assets** of 32.4% in 2017 is above the target level for another year 
and as such we expect to meet or exceed our return on net operating 
assets** target. We continue to deliver further expansion in the operating 
profit* margin, although as we have noted before, the target remains a 
challenging one in the time frame set out. 
Dividends
We are committed to providing a reliable dividend stream for our investors 
through the cycle. Our dividend strategy includes sustaining a significant 
ordinary dividend to shareholders on an annual basis, including through a 
‘normal downturn’, combined with a special dividend to be paid at appropriate 
times in the cycle. This enables shareholders to benefit from the success of 
our strategy at all stages of the cycle. 
In 2017 shareholders received total dividends (including ordinary and special 
dividends) of £451 million (or 13.8 pence per share).
As previously announced, and subject to shareholder approval at the 2018 
Annual General Meeting scheduled for 26 April 2018, we intend to pay 
c.£340 million to shareholders in July 2018 by way of a special dividend. 
Accordingly, subject to shareholder approval at the 2018 Annual General 
Meeting, in 2018 shareholders will receive a total dividend of c.£500 million 
(c.15.3 pence per share), comprising an ordinary dividend of c.£160 million 
(c.4.9 pence per share) and a special dividend of c.£340 million (10.4 pence 
per share).
Our people
I would like to take this opportunity to reiterate Kevin’s words of thanks to the 
teams and the individuals across our business. Individually, and working 
together, our people are an important competitive advantage. I believe we 
have the best people and culture in the industry. I am particularly proud of the 
personal and professional commitments our employees make towards our 
charity partners and their local communities. A great example of this is our 
Taylor Wimpey Challenge, which is now into its fourth year. To date, our 
employees from across all of our regional businesses and functions have 
participated and together have raised more than £171k for the Youth 
Adventure Trust and other charities. More information can be found on our 
case study on page 34.
A key aspiration, and goal, for the Group Management Team is to make 
Taylor Wimpey the employer of choice and establish a culture where 
individuals from all backgrounds can reach their full potential. We were 
pleased to have been named in the 'Top 20 Places To Work' in the UK, by 
Glassdoor, as voted for by employees, the only commercial housebuilder to 
make the list.
Our employee engagement survey, conducted in 2017, highlighted key 
strengths but more importantly has highlighted areas for improvement and 
these will be a key area of focus for 2018. We aim to do this annually so we 
can measure performance. More information can be found on page 22 and 
throughout this report.

Customers
Customer service continues to be a key priority for all employees at Taylor 
Wimpey and is integral to our vision for the future of the business. We aim to 
put the needs of our customers at the heart of our decision-making. During 
2017 we built on the early success of our new customer service approach, 
which focuses on getting it right first time and improving the clarity and 
openness of our communication with customers, and have continued to 
make good progress implementing this approach across the business. Whilst 
we recognise there is more to do, we are particularly pleased to see a positive 
trend in customer satisfaction feedback, with scores in the last six months 
averaging over 90%. Internally, we are pleased to see the approach 
embedding well in the business, where 95% of Taylor Wimpey employees 
believe that Taylor Wimpey aims to deliver the best customer service in the 
homebuilding industry, based on our employee survey. In an industry that is 
growing at pace, delivery of quality alongside volume growth is not always 
easy and it has been a priority to ensure that our people have the right 
resources, and that we are clear that we prioritise delivering the right quality 
over short term financial results. 
During 2017, we achieved a customer satisfaction score of 88% (2016: 85%), 
reflecting the number of customers who were satisfied with the quality of their 
Taylor Wimpey home and 89% of customers would recommend Taylor 
Wimpey to a friend, based on the Home Builders Federation (HBF) survey. 
The survey is conducted by the National House-Building Council (NHBC) at 
eight weeks after completion to monitor our performance and identify areas 
for improvement.
As we have previously announced and as Kevin sets out in more detail on 
page 7, we have made good progress in securing agreements with 
freeholders representing over 90% of historic leases with a ten-year doubling 
ground rent clause, to enable our customers to convert to an RPI-based 
structure, should they elect to participate in our assistance scheme. We 
continue to work with the remaining freeholders to address the small number 
of remaining leases. A provision of £130 million, before tax, was recorded as 
an exceptional item in the H1 2017 accounts as a result of the leasehold 
review, and remains unchanged in the full year 2017 accounts.
Research and development
Research and development is a key area of focus as we seek to understand 
what our future customers will want and need. Our Project 2020 design 
competition in partnership with the Royal Institute of British Architects (RIBA) 
attracted over 100 entries from 14 different countries. The two-stage 
competition invited architects from across the globe to design new house type 
typologies with the brief of being innovative, pragmatic, cost effective, capable 
of high-quality mass production and which would appeal to future customers 
and their changing needs.
The ‘Infinite House’ designed by OpenStudio Architects, based in London, 
was chosen and will be built into a prototype in 2018. We selected a design 
that can be easily adapted both internally and externally to suit different sites 
and customer demographics. We are using the winning design to create a 
series of prototype homes on three of our developments. We achieved 
planning permission for the sites during 2017 and construction will begin in 
2018. More information can be found within our Sustainability Report 2017.
Chief Executive’s Statement continued
 
 
 
 
Research and development 
Research and development will help us to meet the changing needs  
and aspirations of our customers. By exploring new approaches and 
technologies we can also improve efficiency in construction and reduce 
the environmental impact of the homes we build, helping to future-proof 
our business.
Demonstrating excellence through improved operational efficiency 
and discipline
We continue to improve our business through our investment in people, product, processes and systems 
through research and development and embedding improvements to our customer service processes.
 
 
Land
Land is the critical raw material for our business and the ability to purchase 
the right sites in the right locations, at the right price and the right point in 
the cycle, is an important driver of value. We have remained disciplined 
since we re-entered the land market in 2011 and have built a short term 
landbank of c.75k plots, of which 52% is strategically sourced. Given this 
strength and quality of the landbank, we are focused on delivering value 
and maximising returns from our investments.
Build
We work with selected subcontractors and build using carefully sourced 
materials to ensure that the homes that we sell are of a high quality and  
are built safely, efficiently, cost-effectively and with minimal impact on 
the environment.
Our health, safety and environmental management system covers  
all our business activities. It includes procedures and processes to keep 
noise, dust and disturbance to a minimum on all our operational sites to 
prevent pollution incidents and to protect the biodiversity of the 
local environment.
Outlets
Our selling outlets are located in villages, towns and cities where people 
want to live, and which are supported by strong demographics and 
local economies.

Health and safety 
The health and safety of individuals on our sites will always be our number one 
priority and it continues to be the first item discussed at every plc and regional 
board meeting. It remains one of the highest rated questions in our annual 
employee engagement survey, with 98% of employees believing Taylor 
Wimpey takes health and safety in the workplace seriously.
Following the tragic fire at Grenfell Tower in London in June 2017, we 
conducted an internal review into our current and historic developments, 
working, as appropriate, with building owners, management companies, 
independent fire safety experts and local fire and rescue services. On sites 
where there are tall buildings with Aluminium Composite Material cladding,  
we have sought advice from independent fire safety experts, and, where 
required, have put in place additional measures to ensure that the buildings 
are fully compliant with the Government’s guidance on interim fire safety 
measures. We welcome the commissioning of the independent Hackitt 
Review on building regulations and fire safety, and look forward to working 
positively with Government and other agencies to ensure that the outcomes 
are effective and appropriate for the long term.
UK current trading and outlook
We have made a good start to 2018 and are encouraged by solid levels of 
demand coming into the spring selling season. The fundamentals for new 
build housing in the UK remain good with strong customer confidence in  
our core geographies. 
Customers continue to benefit from a competitive mortgage market and 
continued low interest rates. Help to Buy is a key differentiator for new build 
housing and remains popular with customers, enabling them to take the first 
step onto or move up the housing ladder. Customer demand and pricing in 
Central London remain stable. 
The net private sales rate for the year to date (w/e 18 February 2018) remains 
high at 0.81, against a very strong comparator (2017 equivalent period: 0.91), 
and remains in line with our expectations and plans for 2018. 
As at 18 February 2018, we were c.47% forward sold for private completions 
for 2018, with a total order book value of £1,968 million (2017 equivalent 
period: £1,978 million), excluding joint ventures. This order book represents 
8,415 homes (2017 equivalent period: 8,573). In Central London c.52% of 
private completions for 2018 are forward sold, as at 18 February 2018 (2017 
equivalent period: 58%). We prioritise getting outlets open efficiently and in the 
right way for our customers. As at 18 February 2018, we are building on 97% 
of our sites with implementable planning. 
We expect underlying build cost increases during 2018 to be at a similar level 
to 2017, at around 3-4%.
Following the introduction of a number of changes to our customer service 
approach in early 2016, we have been particularly pleased to see a significant 
improvement in customer satisfaction, averaging a score of over 90% in the 
last six months. Ensuring that we get the product quality and service right for 
our customers is a key priority for us.
As previously announced, we will pay a total dividend in 2018 of c.£500  
million, subject to shareholder approvals, and confirm our intention  
to make further material capital returns in 2019 and beyond. 
Whilst we have seen no adverse impact on trading, we are conscious of the 
wider political and economic risks. We are confident that our well-capitalised 
balance sheet together with our high-quality landbank with outlets located in 
places where demand is high and where people want to live provides the 
flexibility and resilience needed to manage all types of market conditions 
through the cycle.

Taylor Wimpey plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Strategic Report We are a value-driven business, with a long term, sustainable focus.
Our focus remains on adding value and sustainable growth as we maximise 
efficiency through operational excellence and discipline on our sites and 
throughout our business.
We have a clear strategy and a strong focus on where we can add further 
value to the business. In this way, we are confident that we can adapt to all 
market conditions from a position of strength and perform well, underpinning 
our value proposition to shareholders and other stakeholders. 
We believe that financial results must be achieved in the right way and as a 
responsible business we acknowledge both our obligations to the 
communities we operate in and the opportunity to work with our stakeholders 
to create value together. 
Since setting out our strategy in 2011, we have made significant progress 
towards our financial objectives. More information on our strategy, updated 
targets and performance can be found on pages 16 and 20.
Today we have a strong landbank of c.75k plots underpinned by a strategic 
pipeline of c.117k potential plots.
We will be hosting a Strategy Day in May 2018, where we will update the 
market on our views of long term strategy.
Strategy set to manage through the cycle
The housing market is cyclical and so factors such as customer confidence and mortgage cost inevitably have a direct impact 
on the short term outlook. We believe that a long term view and a proactive and flexible approach are needed to manage 
through the cycle. Our strategy is built on this and so seeks to protect growth whilst mitigating future downside risk. This 
applies to all areas of the business, from landbuying to our Dividend Policy.
High earnings quality with high margin driven by strong landbank
Steady growth has created a sustainable business focused on good-quality locations where people want to live.
We believe that quality of location is a key determinant of a home purchase and that this remains true through all 
market conditions.
We have taken a very disciplined approach since we set out the strategy back in 2011. This applies to all areas from the returns 
we expect to deliver from our sites through to the quality of those locations which we believe will differentiate us irrespective 
of the cycle.
Quality business with further continuous operational improvement
We have always been clear that our quality measures are as important to us as our financial objectives and are key to the way 
we run our business. We believe that these areas will become more important during this cycle, and will become an area of 
clear differentiation for Taylor Wimpey and contribute to our long term success. We will maintain a firm focus on health and 
safety, which will always be our non-negotiable top priority. We will continue to improve the business through our investment in 
our people, product, processes and systems, through research and development and embedding improvements to our 
customer service processes.
Our strategy is differentiated by a long term focus on value and on achieving 
both our financial and quality objectives sustainably in a cyclical environment.

Dual stream dividend underpins value
We are confident that the quality of our short term landbank, with the underpin of our significant strategic land pipeline, 
combined with a high-quality balance sheet, will mean that we can continue to be cash generative through the cycle, enabling 
us to sustain a significant ordinary dividend to shareholders on an annual basis, including through a ‘normal’ downturn. We will 
also supplement this with special dividends at appropriate times in the cycle.

Our people
We aim to be the employer of choice in the  
housebuilding industry.
What we do
We aim to be the employer of choice in the housebuilding industry,

regardless of market conditions or their background.

Progress in 2017
Having introduced 
many new initiatives 
and frameworks in 
2016 including 
enhanced flexible 
benefits, new 
development 
programmes and 
widening our hiring 
channels, 2017 has 
focused on ensuring 
that these are 
embedded and owned 
by the business, and 
seen as ‘business 
as usual’. 
Priorities for 2018
With the ongoing 
challenge for skills and 
resources in the 
housebuilding sector 
and the targets we 
have set ourselves, we 
will continue to focus 
on how we effectively 
attract, develop, and 
retain our people so 
that they are fully 
engaged with the 
company to deliver 
both our short term 
targets and longer term 
strategic goals. In 
doing so, we aspire to 
become known in the 
sector as the ‘employer 
of choice’. 
Business model
We believe that a long term view and a proactive 
approach are needed to deliver value through the 
housing cycle and in the wider environment in which 
we operate. Key to this approach is our management 
of risk, which protects shareholder value whilst still 
enabling us to take advantage of opportunities and 
drive further growth from the business. We believe that 
financial results must be achieved in the right way and 
as a responsible business we acknowledge both our 
obligations to the communities we operate in and the 
opportunity to work with our stakeholders to create 
value together. We believe that we can deliver 
enhanced value through the housing cycle and benefit 
shareholders by driving the outputs of our strategy in 
three main areas:
 – Dividend Policy
 – Medium term financial targets (2016-2018)
 – Further continuous operational improvement

term targets

Creating 
value across 
the cycle Stakeholder engagement: We strive to be an open, transparent and responsive company for all our stakeholders.
Managing the planning and community  
engagement process
We aim to be the industry leader in managing the planning  
and community engagement process.
What we do
We aim to be the industry leader in all aspects of planning and to obtain 
the right planning consents that enable us to respond to a changing 
market, reflect the desires of our customer base and deliver the quality 
homes we want to build, whilst meeting our financial objectives.
Why is it important for all our stakeholders?
We believe that local communities should have a say in development. 
This enables us to achieve the right planning permissions and ensure our 
developments are valued by their local communities.
How are we different?
We actively seek the views of local communities and other stakeholders. 
We develop a tailored planning and community engagement strategy for 
each site and work closely with communities and other local 
stakeholders throughout all aspects of the planning process. We believe 
that we have a responsibility to contribute to our local communities and 
that this responsibility grows with our success.

Progress in 2017
In 2017, we contributed 
£413 million to the local 
communities in which 
we build across the UK 
via planning obligations, 
providing, for example, 
local infrastructure, 
affordable homes, 
public transport and 
education facilities 
(2016: £363 million).  
As at 18 February 
2018, we are building 
on 97% of our sites  
with implementable 
planning.
Priorities for 2018
Continue to maintain 
best practice 
community 
engagement. 
Continue to 
investigate ways to 
engage with a wider 
and more diverse 
range of people 
within the local 
communities in 
which we operate.
Selecting land
We believe that the quality of our landbank is one of the key 
strengths for Taylor Wimpey.
What we do
Good-quality land with planning is the critical ‘raw material’ for our 
business. The land that we acquire, together with the planning potential 
we work with local authorities and communities to create, is key to 
defining products, locations, target customer base and prices, and 
underpins our confidence in our future financial performance.
Why is it important for all our stakeholders?
The value we create for our shareholders, communities and customers 
all starts with land. We add value through planning, allowing us to 
generate the best quality returns. Land is a scarce resource and we want 
to make the best use of what is available, select the right sites and 
transform them into vibrant and thriving communities.
How are we different?
We have a strong short term landbank at c.75k plots. Our investment 
and scale are based on our view of land quality and capital risk in a 
cyclical market. We are focused on selecting the right land and 
developing it in a sustainable manner. We have one of the largest 
strategic land pipelines in the sector with c.117k potential plots.

53% of completions

pipeline. We continue 
to prioritise opening 
our outlets as 
efficiently as possible. 
Priorities for 2018
Continue to work with 
land vendors, 
communities and 
local authorities to 
convert land from the 
strategic pipeline into 
the short term 
landbank. Continue to 
work on ‘land light’ 
structures and active

Continue to focus on

Delivering customer service
We remain focused on and are committed to delivering an 
excellent customer service to all of our customers at every 
stage of their journey.
What we do
We want to ensure that we always deliver our homes to the quality 
standard to which we aspire and that our service is always proactive, 
positive and professional. Our customer vision is to help our customers 
make our houses their homes.
Why is it important for all our stakeholders?
Whilst we operate in a cyclical market, we strongly believe that a 
customer-centric approach is needed throughout the cycle. We 
recognise that buying a home is a major financial and emotional 
investment and it is critical that we give our customers the 
right experience.
How are we different?
We are in the process of embedding our new customer approach across 
the business with our focus on three main areas: our culture, structure 
and process.

Progress in 2017
Having introduced a 
number of customer 
service initiatives in 
recent years, such as 
the newly created role 
of Head of Customer 
Service and the 
Home Quality 
Inspection (HQI), a 
key focus in 2017 has 
been embedding the 
new processes and 
delivering a consistent 
standard. We are 
pleased that during 
2017 we received a 
customer satisfaction 
score of 88%, an 
improvement on the 
85% of last year and 
just short of our target 
of 90%. Whilst we 
have made great 
strides, we know 
there is still 
more to do.
Priorities for 2018
The key priority for 
2018 will be to 
continue to enhance 
our customer service 
offering, and we will 
therefore be aiming 
for a further increase 
in our customer 
satisfaction score and 
aim to become a five 
star housebuilder. In 
2018, we will also 
continue the rollout of 
our customer portal 
which improves the 
information flow 
between our 
customer facing 
teams and 
homebuyers at every 
stage of their contact 
with Taylor Wimpey.
Getting the homebuilding basics right
Getting the basics right means effective processes are 
consistently applied across our regional businesses.
What we do
We work with selected subcontractors and build using carefully sourced 
materials to ensure that the homes that we sell are of a high quality and 
are built safely, efficiently, cost-effectively and with minimal impact on 
the environment.
Why is it important for all our stakeholders?
There is nothing more important to us than providing a safe place in 
which our employees and subcontractors can work. We are also 
committed to high standards of environmental management. The 
building process is carefully managed by our site-based and regional 
production teams to ensure quality, minimise disruption to residents in 
the surrounding areas, and to protect and enhance the value of 
each site.
How are we different?
We believe that quality objectives matter as much as financial objectives. 
Heath and safety is our non-negotiable top priority. Operating sustainably 
is both the right thing to do and makes good business sense.

Priorities for 2018
Health and safety of 
our people, the build 
process and 
customer service will 
all continue to be of 
critical focus for the 
Group in 2018. We 
also continue to 
examine potential 
improvements to the 
build process whilst 
also always 
considering the 
environmental 
impacts of 
our process. Optimising value 
We look to optimise the value of each site not only during the 
initial acquisition process, but throughout the planning and 
development stages so that the original value is not only 
protected but enhanced.
What we do
Our ability to constantly increase efficiency and tightly control costs is part  
of the Taylor Wimpey culture and remains central to delivering enhanced 
returns. This extends to and encompasses all aspects of our business as 
we strive to optimise and capture value at every level from procurement 
through to delivery. We also aim to add value to the charities we support 
and to our wider partnerships.
Why is it important for all our stakeholders?
The discipline of continually reviewing and challenging ourselves to do more 
ensures we do more than simply protect the business, we enhance the value.
We believe that as a responsible business we must actively contribute to 
helping others, whether financially, with our time or with our expertise.
How are we different?
We have a relentless focus on value at every stage of our business model 
and this is ingrained into the Taylor Wimpey mindset. We also balance our 
desire to improve quality with a focus on making our assets work harder for 
us and our stakeholders.

TBC
We are one of the largest residential developers in the 
UK, building nearly 15,000 homes in 2017. Our business 
touches many lives. 
For our customers, the home they buy from us is often the 
biggest and most important purchase they will ever make. 
It’s where they will spend most of their time, and where 
many of the important events in their lives will happen. So 
the way we design and build our homes and 
developments can have a significant influence on our 
customers’ future happiness and wellbeing. As a 
responsible homebuilder we seek to design and build our 
developments in the right way, so that they become 
thriving, inclusive and sustainable communities for 
generations to come.
We directly employ nearly 5,000 people, with many 
thousands more on our sites and in our supply chain.  
We aim to treat everyone we work with fairly and  
provide support and development opportunities for our  
employees so that they can enjoy a satisfying career  
with Taylor Wimpey. 
Reducing our impact on the environment is very important 
to us, so we consider it at every stage of our operations. We 
work with our partners in the supply chain to source 
sustainable materials, and with our subcontractors to 
minimise the impact of our sites. We also design homes to 
be resource efficient.
Our Legacy, Engagement and Action for the Future (LEAF) 
committee oversees our sustainability programme and 
management of sustainability risks. It is chaired by Lee 
Bishop, our Major Developments Director and 
representative of the GMT. Its members include our Head 
of Sustainability and senior executives from our 
procurement, production, and design functions and from 
our regional businesses. 
Sustainability is integrated into our values and cultural 
principles, particularly our commitment to a sustainable 
future and to build a proud legacy. We will be doing further 
work in 2018 to develop our sustainability strategy, 
focusing on the issues that matter most for our customers, 
our business and our stakeholders.

Building a 
sustainable 
business Our approach
We want to attract and retain the best people and 
treat them fairly and with respect.
We continue to make a significant investment in 
and commitment to the recruitment of our next 
generation of future leaders, including extending 
our trainee schemes and investing in the skills 
and development of our employees across the 
business, to ensure that Taylor Wimpey attracts 
and retains the best people in the industry 
through the cycle.
We aim to be the employer of choice in the 
housebuilding industry, attracting and retaining the 
best people to establish a culture that gives all 
individuals the opportunity and support to develop 
to their full potential, regardless of market 
conditions or their background. We were pleased 
to have been named in the top 20 places to work 
in the UK, by Glassdoor, as voted for by 
employees, the only commercial housebuilder to 
make the list.
During 2017 we directly employed, on average, 
4,999 people across the UK (2016: 4,697) 
and provided opportunities for a further 13,442 
operatives on our sites. Our voluntary employee 
turnover rate remained low at 14.0% 
(2016: 13.9%).
What makes us different
Our people matter
With the ongoing challenge for skills and resources 
in the housebuilding sector and the targets we 
have set ourselves, we have continued to focus on 
how we effectively attract, develop, and retain our 
people so that they are fully engaged with the 
company to deliver both our short term targets 
and longer term strategic goals.
We aim to be the employer of choice in the 
housebuilding industry.

Ingrid Osborne was selected for the Cranfield 
School of Management’s “100 Women to Watch 
2017”. Ingrid joined the group as a graduate 
trainee in 2001, and worked in various roles before 
being appointed Managing Director of Central 
London in 2010. Ingrid is now Divisional Managing 
Director for Central and East London and has 
been a member of the General Management 
Team since 2013. Ingrid commented: 
“A broad range of opinions, backgrounds and 
experiences are always beneficial in business. So 
the more we can encourage and embrace 
diversity, the better. As one of three women on our 
leadership team, it’s important that we share our 
experiences with colleagues and help mentor and 
encourage the next generation to achieve their 
goals. As leaders we have a critical role to play in 
creating the right culture and leading by example. I 
want people to know that I use flexible working 
options, so that they feel able to do the same. By 
treating people as individuals and working 
together, we build trust and that positively impacts 
engagement and productivity.”

Strategic Report Investing in our people
Through our learning and development initiatives, 
aimed at growing talent from within, we give our 
employees the opportunities and skills to become 
our future business leaders and develop their 
careers with Taylor Wimpey.
There is a significant skills shortage in our industry 
and we are committed to playing our part in 
addressing this. We have made a significant 
investment in, and commitment to, the recruitment 
of our next generation of future leaders, including 
extending our trainee schemes and investing in the 
skills and development of our employees across 
the business, to ensure that Taylor Wimpey 
attracts and retains the best people in the industry 
through the cycle. During 2017, we recruited 204 
apprentices (including 67 site management 
apprentices), 28 management trainees and 31 
graduates, whilst improving our apprenticeship 
and trainee schemes across a number of areas 
(2016 total: 147). We are also planning to relaunch 
our management trainee programme in summer 
2018. This will offer three-year development 
programmes and will also significantly increase the 
overall number of trainee positions.
Listening to our people 
We launched and held our first National Employee 
Forum (NEF) in 2017. The main objective of the 
NEF will be to gather employee feedback on 
individual topics important to the business and 
share it with the relevant members of senior 
management. The NEF will build upon the existing 
regional Employee Consultative Committee 
structure so as to enhance the dialogue between 
the Board, Group Management Team and 
our employees.
In 2017 we undertook an employee engagement 
survey, ‘Talkback’, with an encouragingly high 
participation rate of 72%. We were impressed with 
the overall results and high level of engagement 
across the whole business. We were particularly 
pleased to see improved scores in customer 
service, flexible working and our training and 
benefits package. Importantly it highlighted areas 
which needed further work, including better 
collaboration between teams, and we will be 
focusing on this in 2018. 
Striving to become a more

We aim to be an inclusive employer and to attract, 
retain and promote employees from all 
backgrounds. Encouraging and embracing 
diversity is now one of our cultural principles. We 
have developed a Diversity and Inclusion Strategy 
that focuses on the impact of leadership for 
creating and maintaining a diverse and inclusive 
culture; improving how diversity and inclusion are 
embedded into our policies and procedures, and 
reflecting our commitment to this.
Human rights
We support the United Nations’ Universal 
Declaration of Human Rights and have policies 
and processes in place to ensure that we act in 
accordance with our cultural values which 
encompass areas such as business conduct, 
equal opportunities, anti-corruption and 
whistleblowing. We do not consider this a material 
issue in our business.

How is Taylor Wimpey 
addressing the construction 
skills shortage?
We can play a part in addressing the 
skills shortage facing the housebuilding 
sector and wider construction industry. 
We offer a range of trainee positions to 
attract young people and address 
specific skills gaps. We now have 575 
people in entry-level positions. We are 
piloting a new approach to hiring 
trades professionals increasing the 
number we employ directly (rather 
than via subcontractors). We also 
partner with others through initiatives 
such as the Home Building 
Skills Partnership.
Q&A
 23
taylorwimpey.co.uk Our approach
We believe that the land market and planning 
environment have significantly changed over recent 
years. Whilst the planning process remains 
complex and is often slow, there is better clarity in 
many local authority areas and a better supply of 
suitable land that has good planning prospects 
with reduced competition. Our ability to buy 
high-quality land at the right time in the cycle and 
enhance it through planning, remains an important 
driver of value as it enables us to build and sell the 
right product, create the right community and 
deliver the right service to our customers. 
We believe that quality of location is a key 
determinant of value through all market conditions. 
Our landbank is broadly spread across the country 
in targeted quality locations, supported by strong 
demographics and economics, in the villages, 
towns and cities where people want to live.
What makes us different
New opportunities 
We are highly selective with regard to the types of 
sites that we buy, focusing on the quality of the 
land rather than the number of plots acquired. We 
employ dedicated land teams in each of our 24 
regional businesses, who use their expertise and 
local knowledge to identify potential high-quality, 
sustainable sites. We have a targetted approach to 
our land investment. This is focused on where we 
can add value as we seek to maximise the returns 
from our investments, while continuing to ensure 
that the business is optimally positioned to deliver 
those returns on a sustainable basis.
During the year, and as previously announced, 
we added a further site to our Major Developments 
portfolio of large scale land opportunities. The land 
acquired is a regeneration scheme at Clapham 
Junction in central London and is a joint venture 
with Wandsworth London Borough Council. It is 
expected to deliver over 2,200 homes. Furthermore, 
as previously announced, our Central London 
business acquired 681 plots in 2017 from the 
Royal Mail that forms part of the Mount Pleasant 
estate, some of which will be retained by the 
Royal Mail Group.
Short term landbank
Our short term landbank stands at c.75k plots, 
equating to c.5.1 years of supply at current 
completion levels as at 31 December 2017. During 
2017 we acquired 8,040 plots (2016: 6,355 plots) 
at anticipated contribution margins of c.28% and 
return on capital employed*** of c.34%.
In the year, we achieved a 1.7 percentage points 
margin upside on completions from land acquired 
since 2009, compared with the expected margin 
at the point of acquisition.
The average cost of land as a proportion of 
average selling price within the short term owned 
landbank remains low at 14.8% (2016: 15.4%). 
The average selling price in the short term owned 
landbank in 2017 increased by 8.1% to £280k 
(2016: £259k). 
We believe that the quality of our landbank 
is one of the key strengths of Taylor Wimpey.

Case study
In August 2017, the Group completed contracts 
to purchase part of the Mount Pleasant estate, 
in Central London, from the Royal Mail Group, after 
enabling works by Royal Mail Group had been 
completed. The site has a detailed development 
planning consent, secured by the Royal Mail 
Group in 2015, to create 681 residential units 
including affordable housing, retail and office  
space and public areas.
Selecting Land
24 
Taylor Wimpey plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Strategic Report Strategic pipeline in place for 
long term success
A key strength of Taylor Wimpey is our strategic 
land pipeline. Strategic land is any land which does 
not have any form of residential consent at the time 
we take a commercial interest. This provides an 
enhanced supply of land at a reduced cost. 
Importantly, it gives us greater control over the 
planning permissions we receive. We have one of 
the largest strategic pipelines in the sector which 
stood at a record of c.117k potential plots as at 
31 December 2017 (31 December 2016: c.108k 
potential plots). During 2017, we converted a 
further 7,863 plots from the strategic pipeline to 
the short term landbank (2016: 9,519 plots). We 
continue to seek new opportunities and added a 
net 17.1k new potential plots to the strategic 
pipeline in 2017 (2016: 10.8k). In the year, a record 
53% of our completions were sourced from the 
strategic pipeline (2016: 51%).
Case study
In 2017, Taylor Wimpey Midlands purchased freehold land known as Flying Fields, Southam, 
Warwickshire. The land was acquired with an outline planning permission for 535 new homes of 
which 35% is to be affordable housing. Extensive areas of open space and a small retail store are to 
be accommodated as part of the development. The 60 acre site is agricultural land which was used 
as an airfield during the war. Southam is a popular market town in the district of Stratford upon Avon 
where demand for new homes is strong owing to its proximity to Coventry and ease of access to the 
M40 motorway and employment opportunities. Taylor Wimpey has another successful scheme of 
165 new homes currently under construction in Southam. The land and planning team at Taylor 
Wimpey Midlands has worked closely with the District Council and Southam Town Council to 
implement the masterplan for the site, which incorporates extensive landscaping throughout to reflect 
its rural edge of town setting.
Our KPIs
Strategically sourced  
completions
Objective
We aim to source more than 40% of our 
completions from the strategic pipeline per 
annum in the medium term.
Definition
Number of completions which originally did not 
have planning permission when we acquired a 
commercial interest in them, expressed as a 
percentage of total completions.
Why is it key to our strategy?
The strategic pipeline enhances our ability to 
increase the contribution per legal completion 
because of the inherent margin uplift from 
strategic plots. It also allows us to take a long 
term view of sites. 
Owned and controlled plots  
with planning
Objective
We aim to maintain sufficient land in our 
portfolio to enable us to remain selective in 
future purchases.
Definition
The total number of plots that we either own or 
control, with some form of planning consent. 
Why is it key to our strategy?
Having a portfolio of land in place is key to 
planning the required scale of our building 
operations for future home completions. It 
enables us to be selective in land purchases.

How is sustainability  
integrated into land selection?
Our land teams integrate sustainability into 
the land acquisition process from the start, 
looking at factors such as how well 
connected the site is to transport links, the 
potential impact on habitats and species, 
the risk of flooding and whether the 
development will support local economic 
activity. Our Land Assessment and 
Management Process (LAMP) helps us to 
identify and manage sustainability risks at 
site-level before and during construction. 
Q&A
 25
taylorwimpey.co.uk Our approach
Whilst we have a national presence, we are proud 
to operate as a local homebuilder with 24 regional 
businesses across the country. We continually 
explore ways in which we can work more closely 
with local communities. We are committed to 
working with local people and other stakeholders 
throughout the planning process and seek to 
engage, consult and work in partnership with 
communities and all interested stakeholders.
We do this by creating a tailored planning and 
community engagement strategy for each site 
which reflects the needs of the local area. Our 
approach goes well beyond regulatory 
requirements, with engagement starting before we 
submit a planning application and continuing 
throughout the development process. Wherever 
possible, we use the feedback obtained as part of 
our community engagement to develop and 
improve our design proposals.
To fully understand local views, it is important that 
we reach a wide range of stakeholders from 
residents, property owners and local authorities, to 
businesses, schools, residents’ associations and 
other groups.
We are committed to publishing information on 
proposed developments online so that members 
of local communities and other interested parties 
can easily find out what we are planning and 
where. The Taylor Wimpey website includes pages 
for all of our proposed developments throughout 
the UK. We would like people to register their 
interest so we can update them on progress. 
Above all, we want wider and more diverse groups 
and individuals to get involved and tell us their 
views, whether positive or negative.
We aim to be the industry leader in managing the 
planning and community engagement process.

Our KPIs
Conversion of strategic pipeline
Objective
We aim to convert on average c.6k plots per 
annum in the medium term. 
Definition
Number of plots, which originally did not have 
planning permission when we took a 
commercial interest in the land, and which we 
have promoted through the planning process 
to achieve some form of planning. In this way 
we convert potential plots from the strategic 
pipeline to plots in the short term landbank.
Why is it key to our strategy?
The strength of our strategic pipeline (plots 
without residential planning consent) is a key 
differentiator and enables us to be extremely 
selective in the short term land market and also 
reduces the pressure on the teams. We work 
with landowners, local authorities and 
communities to promote the strategic pipeline 
through the planning process and achieve 
planning permission. Strategic land pipeline 
conversions can be variable year on year and 
so we view an average target as the 
appropriate measure.

Taylor Wimpey plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Strategic Report Case study
At our Newton Farm (Phase 2) development, in our 
West Scotland business, Taylor Wimpey agreed 
with South Lanarkshire Council to contribute 
c.£9.4m and 7.2 net developable acres for the 
development of a new school as part of the 
Section 75 (S75) agreement. Construction of the 
school was the responsibility of South Lanarkshire 
Council. The Council had a desire to open the new 
school facility by August 2017 for the new school 
term. In order to facilitate the school construction 
programme, and meet our obligations under the 
S75 agreement, we installed part of the 
development’s new spine road by December 
2015, providing access and a serviced site for the 
Council. South Lanarkshire Council was therefore 
able to commence works on site in early 2016, 
and deliver the school on programme, opening in 
August 2017. Our West Scotland business 
maintains engagement with the school, providing 
health and safety talks, demonstrations and 
other initiatives.
What makes us different
We build much more than homes
We work with communities and our partners to 
create well designed, sustainable neighbourhoods 
where our customers want to live, grow and thrive 
and which are valued by our local communities.
We aim to create great places to live, work and 
play; designing our developments to become 
thriving and inclusive communities with a strong 
sense of place and character. We have appointed 
an urban designer to work with our regional 
businesses on placemaking and launched our 
Design Academy covering the core principles of 
urban design and how to create sustainable 
communities where people want to live.
We make a significant contribution to the local 
communities we operate in. In 2017, we 
contributed £413 million to the local communities 
in which we build across the UK via planning 
obligations, providing, for example, local 
infrastructure, affordable homes, public transport 
and education facilities (2016: £363 million).
Our developments create economic benefits for 
local communities. As well as new housing, these 
can include new jobs on site and in the supply 
chain, increased revenues for local businesses 
during construction and from new residents, and 
benefits arising from our investment in new 
infrastructure and amenities. We use our 
Economic Benefits toolkit to estimate and 
communicate these benefits to stakeholders 
during the planning process.
Stakeholder engagement
We introduced a comprehensive community 
engagement framework in 2011 and have been 
regularly improving and updating it since. We are 
proud of our approach to community engagement 
and the way that our employees deliver it. The 
framework applies to every stage of the 
development timeline, from pre-planning 
consultation to ongoing communication with 
existing and new residents during and after 
construction. We also have a Building Our 
Reputation toolkit that provides information and 
practical tools to help our employees communicate 
honestly and openly with communities and 
customers throughout the development process.
We believe that a positive and structured approach 
to working with others is at the heart of a 
successful scheme. We work in partnership with 
the communities in which we build to deliver 
homes that meet their requirements 
and aspirations.
Expertise in planning
We aim to be the industry leader in all aspects of 
planning and to secure the right planning consents 
that enable us to respond to a changing market, 
reflect the desires of our customer base and 
deliver the quality homes we want to build, whilst 
meeting our financial objectives.
Planning is fundamental to the success of our 
business, and we aim to progress sites through 
the planning process to enable us to develop our 
sites as efficiently as possible. During 2017 we 
worked with communities, planners and 
landowners to convert a further 7,863 plots from 
the strategic pipeline.
We aim to create development proposals that are 
financially viable, benefit the local community and 
provide the housing that is needed. We prioritise 
getting outlets open efficiently and in the right way 
for our customers. As at 18 February 2018, we are 
building on 97% of sites with implementable 
planning. 
We believe that the land market and planning 
environment have significantly changed over recent 
years. Whilst the planning process remains 
complex and is often slow, there is better clarity in 
many local authority areas and a better supply of 
suitable land that has good planning prospects 
with reduced competition.
How do you engage a wide range of local stakeholders?
We seek views from a wide range of stakeholders from neighbouring residents and property 
owners to local authorities, businesses, schools and other groups. We use a variety of channels 
including meetings, exhibitions, workshops, newsletters and information boards. We have also 
been trialling the use of social media, particularly Facebook and Twitter, to help capture and 
respond to feedback and to reach a wider audience.
Q&A
 27
taylorwimpey.co.uk Our approach
The health and safety of individuals on our sites will 
always be our number one priority and continues 
to be the first item discussed at every plc and 
regional board meeting. It remains one of the 
highest rated questions in our annual employee 
engagement survey with 98% of employees 
believing Taylor Wimpey takes health and safety in 
the workplace seriously.
We are committed to providing a safe place in 
which our employees and subcontractors can 
work and our customers can live, and we will not 
compromise on ensuring that everyone leaves our 
sites safe and well. We have a comprehensive 
Health, Safety and Environmental (HSE) Strategy 
and a fully integrated HSE Management System in 
place which is regularly reviewed at all levels. 
Our Annual Injury Incidence Rate (AIIR) for 
reportable injuries per 100,000 employees and 
contractors reduced to 152 in 2017 (2016: 211). 
Our AIIR for major injuries per 100,000 employees 
and contractors was 54 in 2017 (2016: 53). 
Our AIIR remains below both the HBF Home 
Builder Average and Health and Safety Executive 
Construction Industry Average.
Following the tragic fire at Grenfell Tower in 
London in June 2017, we conducted an internal 
review into our current and historic developments, 
working, as appropriate with building owners, 
management companies, independent fire safety 
experts and local fire and rescue services. On sites 
where there are tall buildings with Aluminium 
Composite Material cladding, we have sought 
advice from independent fire safety experts, and, 
where required, have put in place additional 
measures to ensure that the buildings are fully 
compliant with the Government’s guidance on 
interim fire safety measures. We welcome the 
commissioning of the independent Hackitt Review, 
and look forward to working positively with 
Government and other agencies to ensure that the 
outcomes are effective and appropriate for the 
long term.
Getting the basics right means effective processes are 
consistently applied across our regional businesses.

basics
Case study
Taylor Wimpey Logistics, our supply chain 
business, plays an important role in our supply 
chain management. Around 300 of our sites, 
managed by 21 of our regional businesses, are 
supplied with build materials from Taylor 
Wimpey Logistics. Working on a plot-by-plot 
basis, the business sources bulk materials 
directly from manufacturers to prepare ‘just in 
time’ delivery of build packs for each stage of 
the building process, ensuring materials arrive 
on sites at the appropriate times in the build 
process. This reduces both work in progress 
on site and the potential for loss or damage of 
materials, thus driving build efficiency on 
our schemes.
During peak periods, Taylor Wimpey Logistics 
pick, package and dispatch up to 100,000 
items in 1,500 build packs on around 60 
lorries per week.

Taylor Wimpey plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Strategic Report Case study
Underpinning the importance we 
place on the build process and the 
quality of our final product, we were 
very pleased to record an increase in 
Taylor Wimpey’s performance in the 
National House-Building Council’s 
(NHBC) Pride in the Job Awards. We 
achieved a total of 62 Quality Awards 
(2016: 57), 24 Seals of Excellence 
Awards (2016: 16) and 2 Regional 
Awards in 2017 (2016: 2). Our two 
Regional Winners were Paul 
McLachlan from Taylor Wimpey 
North Yorkshire and Michael 
Wickham from Taylor Wimpey South 
Thames. Our regional winner Paul 
went on to achieve runner up in the 
large builder category of the 
Supreme Awards. 
Paul commented: “Winning the 
Regional Award and then being 
named a runner up in the Supreme 
Awards has been unbelievable, it’s 
been the highlight of working for the 
company as over the years the 
competition gets stronger, the quality 
rises and the standard increases.”
What makes us different
We do not compromise on 
health and safety
We not only create homes that our customers 
want to live in, we want to ensure that every step 
of the way, health and safety is at the forefront. 
Partnering with contractors on safety issues is 
critical to keeping everyone safe on site. Before we 
agree to work with a contractor, we require details 
of their risk assessment process and safety 
procedures for their area of activity.
We clearly communicate critical safety messages 
to site operatives through our ‘Operative’s 
Journey’ process, which starts with our HSE site 
induction. One of the key issues to address is 
preventing ‘safety sign blindness’, and keeping 
safety at the front of everyone’s minds on site.
The HSE induction is supported by regular poster 
campaigns and talks on key topics. In 2017, we 
re-launched our ‘toolbox talks’ as ‘site safe 
briefings’ and made the content more engaging 
for site operatives. 
Our Site Support Team brings together 
representatives from Taylor Wimpey and our 
contractors such as trades supervisors, 
groundworkers supervisors or site operatives to 
encourage a safety mindset. Members are 
nominated by the Site Manager and given a blue 
hat to make them visible on site. Site Support 
Teams participate in improving site safety and 
operatives can talk to members of the team about 
HSE issues, concerns or suggestions. During 
2017 we ran training sessions and team building 
events for Site Support Team members.
Quality product range
We build homes that people want to live in. We 
are proud of the homes we build and the 
communities we create. Our focus is on providing 
high-quality, well-designed, sustainable homes 
and communities that meet the needs and 
aspirations of local residents. Our mix of homes is 
informed by the local area.
We have clear quality and finish standards for all 
Taylor Wimpey homes and during 2017 we 
continued to strengthen our quality assurance 
processes. Each one of our homes should meet 
our quality standards and we want every customer 
to receive excellent service. During the year, we 
appointed a UK Head of Production, a newly 
created role as we seek to ensure we consistently 
achieve a high-quality build for our customers.
It is expected that this will increase customer 
satisfaction and save time and money for the 
business in getting the home delivery right first 
time. There are also sustainability benefits 
associated with achieving high-quality standards, 
including greater durability, less waste and fewer 
resources used for repairs and maintenance.
We continue to offer a wide range of homes from 
one-bedroom apartments to six-bedroom houses, 
with prices ranging from under £70k to over 
£4 million. In 2017 the proportion of apartments in 
our private completions was 16% (2016: 14%). 
The square footage of our total completions also 
decreased slightly to 1,013 square feet 
(2016: 1,021 square feet).
Following the success of our standard house type 
range, which is in place on over 70% of Taylor 
Wimpey sites, in 2017 we introduced a specific 
timber frame house type range. We will be 
reviewing the wider standard house type range to 
further refine in 2018.
Build costs
Our scale affords us the benefit of strong 
purchasing power, and we can achieve significant 
cost savings across our regional businesses with 
national agreements with a number of suppliers.
During 2017, underlying build cost per unit 
increased to £143.7k (2016: £137.2k), reflecting 
underlying build cost inflation as well as some mix 
impact of product delivery in the year. In the 
period, there were increases in underlying build 
cost (excluding house type mix impact) of c.3.5% 
year on year (2016: c.4%), largely due to continued 
pressure on resources to deliver the higher level 
of homebuilding.
Taylor Wimpey Logistics plays an important part in 
our supply chain management, providing us with 
an alternative route to delivery and aiding efficiency 
with the preparation of ‘just in time’ build packs for 
each stage of the building process. 
How do you manage risks  
relating to climate change?
Climate change has the potential to impact 
our business strategy in a number of ways. 
For example, physical changes such as 
rising temperatures and an increase in flood 
risk could affect our customers and 
influence where and how we build our 
homes. We use our Sustainability and 
Climate Change Risk and Opportunity 
Register to guide the climate change 
adaptation of our business practices and 
the homes we build. See our Sustainability 
Report 2017 for more information. 
Q&A
 29
taylorwimpey.co.uk Responsible procurement
A significant proportion of our procurement, 
particularly for materials sourcing, is through large 
contracts with national suppliers. However, we 
also work with many smaller businesses, providing 
labour and services, including companies that are 
local to our development sites. This can benefit the 
business by giving us access to a more diverse 
range of skills and experience and help support the 
local economies in which we work. We provide 
advice and help to small and medium sized 
businesses with HSE risk assessments and other 
site-specific procedures that they need to prepare 
in order to tender for work with us.
The Company welcomes the aims and objectives 
of the Modern Slavery Act 2015 and takes its 
responsibilities under the Act very seriously. As part 
of this we have strengthened oversight of 
standards in our supply chain to make sure we are 
selecting partners who share our commitment to 
responsible business. We published our first 
Modern Slavery Act Statement on our website in 
March 2017. We have been following up with 
suppliers identified as higher risk for further 
engagement. Further information can be found on

are for emissions over which we have financial control. We do not have responsibility for any emissions sources that are not 
included in our consolidated statement.
The following sources of emissions were excluded or part-excluded from this report:
 – Fugitive emissions (refrigerant gases): excluded on the basis of expected immateriality and difficulty in acquiring data
 – Gas and electricity of part-exchange properties: excluded on the basis of immateriality due to very few completions of 
this type
 – Certain joint venture properties: where Taylor Wimpey was not part of the handover process. In these cases other 
homebuilders have captured MCR-related data

Taylor Wimpey plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Strategic Report Our contributions to the environment
We strive to keep any adverse effects that our 
activities may have on local environments and 
communities, such as pollution and ecological 
damage, to a minimum and to make a positive 
contribution to the environment of the areas 
we build in.
We acknowledge the global threat of climate 
change and are committed to reducing our 
emissions, energy use and waste and 
reviewing water use.
We have a comprehensive Waste and Resource 
Strategy and Action Plan for our housing 
operations and our supply chain. We focus on 
seeing materials as resources, using them more 
efficiently through design and on-site recovery, and 
keeping generated waste to a minimum.
During 2017 our construction waste increased by 
6.3% per 100 square metres of completed build. 
We recycled 95% of UK construction waste. 
Environmentally sustainable homes
New homes are considerably more energy-
efficient than older housing stock, and we are 
committed to building increasingly energy-efficient 
homes in line with Government policy and 
Building Regulations. Our ‘fabric first’ approach to 
energy efficiency, which concentrates on highly 
insulated walls and windows, helps owners to 
save energy and money.
Our greenhouse gas emissions (GHG)
We continue to take steps to improve our 
approach to climate change mitigation, adaptation 
and transparency. Our target was a 25% reduction 
in scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas emissions per 
100 square metres of completed homes by 2018 
compared with 2013. We have met this goal, and 
exceeded the target, a year early, achieving a 
38.7% reduction in carbon emissions from 2013.
We held a carbon workshop with the Carbon Trust 
during 2017 to review our approach. As a result, 
we have set a new target to achieve a 50% 
reduction in our direct emissions (scope 1 and 2) 
intensity over 10 years against our 2013 baseline.
We are reviewing our approach to scope 3 
emissions and exploring whether we can set a 
target aligned with climate science. We will be 
doing further work in this area internally and with 
the Carbon Trust during 2018.
We participate in the CDP climate change report 
and received a score of B in 2017 (2016: B). We 
have achieved the Carbon Trust Standard for our 
overall approach to carbon management, including 
our policy, strategy and verification of our data and 
processes. We are the first homebuilder to 
achieve this.
Case study
Taylor Wimpey received the CDP award for the

taylorwimpey.co.uk Our approach
Customer service continues to be a key priority for 
all at Taylor Wimpey and is integral to our vision for 
the future of the business. We aim to put the 
needs of our customers at the heart of our 
decision-making.
We have made great strides in our customer 
service approach. However, there are things that 
we can and must do better.
Across our business operations, we want our 
employees to adopt our customer-centric culture 
and to understand the important role they play with 
our customers. Regardless of the role that any 
Taylor Wimpey employee fulfils in the business, we 
all contribute to the final result for our customers. 
Our aim is to keep our customer at the centre of 
our decisions and coordinate our input to deliver  
a quality home first time, with great service 
throughout their customer journey. This will help 
our customers to settle in quickly and make our 
houses their homes.
During 2017 we built on the early success of our 
new customer service approach, which focuses 
on getting it right first time and improving the clarity 
and openness of our communication with 
customers, and have continued to make good 
progress implementing this approach across the 
business. 
What makes us different
Our strong and sustainable  
customer base
Approximately 97% of our customers are 
owner-occupiers. First time buyers accounted for 
41% of total sales in 2017 (2016: 38%). Investor 
sales continued to be at a very low level at 3% 
(2016: 3%).
Understanding our customers
Over the years our customers’ communication 
preferences have changed. We continue to make 
improvements to our online capabilities, including 
our website and use of social media such as 
Facebook, Twitter and Instagram. During 2017 we 
launched a new customer portal. More information 
can be found within our case study.
A responsible business 
We acknowledge that we do not always get it right 
for our customers and sometimes fall short of our 
high standards. Where this is the case, we work 
with customers to put this right and learn from our 
mistakes. Whilst we recognise there is more to do, 
we are particularly pleased to see a positive trend 
in customer satisfaction feedback, with scores in 
We remain focused on customer service and are 
committed to delivering an excellent customer service 
to all of our customers at every stage of their journey.

Putting customers 
at the heart of 
what we do
Case study
Touchpoint, our customer portal and online 
options system, was officially launched in 2017. 
After a successful pilot phase, the portal is now 
being rolled out across the wider business. 
Touchpoint plays a critical part in improving the 
information flow between our customer facing 
teams and homebuyers at every stage of their 
contact with Taylor Wimpey, from the moment 
they reserve and throughout the aftercare process. 
Once a home is reserved, the portal guides our 
customers through the homebuying process 
letting them know what they need to do next and 
giving immediate access to important updates, for 
example, how the build of their home is 
progressing, counting down to legal completion 
and move-in dates. Touchpoint also offers new 
homeowners useful information about the various 
appliances and systems in their home and enables 
them to log any issues there and then through the 
portal. Touchpoint aims to complement the 
personal service delivered by our Sales Executives, 
Site Managers and Customer Relations Managers, 
offering another more flexible means of 
communication with Taylor Wimpey.

the last six months averaging over 90%. Internally, 
we are pleased to see the approach embedding 
well in the business, where 95% of Taylor Wimpey 
employees believe that Taylor Wimpey aims to 
deliver the best customer service in the 
homebuilding industry, according to our employee 
survey. In an industry growing at pace, delivery of 
quality alongside volume growth is not always easy 
and it has been a priority to ensure that our people 
have the right resources, and that we are clear that 
we prioritise delivering the right quality over short 
term financial results.
We strive to be a five star builder and we have 
made significant investment to improve our 
customer journey. The results from this are starting 
to be realised in a customer satisfaction score of 
88%, up from 85% in 2016, showing progress 
towards our target.
Looking ahead to 2018 and beyond
The continued rollout of our Touchpoint customer 
portal will be a key focus in 2018. Touchpoint will 
not only provide an improved service for our 
customers but should ensure a more helpful and 
informative homebuying experience for 
our customers.
Reflecting the success of our academy-based 
approach in other key areas of the business, our 
new Academy of Customer Excellence (ACE) was 
launched in 2017. It aims to build the skills of our 
customer service, production and sales teams and 
develop further their knowledge of our product 
range, ensuring consistent customer service 
delivery across our regional businesses.
Does Taylor Wimpey monitor 
long term customer satisfaction?
We carry out post-occupancy research to 
help deepen our understanding of customer 
views and the longer term success of our 
developments. In 2017, this included 
research at 16 completed sites that 
explored the impact of design and 
placemaking on customer satisfaction. It 
showed that residents value developments 
with character that are easy to navigate and 
where there is good landscaping and 
access to open and green spaces.

taylorwimpey.co.uk Our approach
We achieve this optimisation of value by 
undertaking a series of thorough reviews of each 
site at all stages of its life cycle, using our value 
improvement and tracking processes to ensure 
that we are continually optimising and delivering 
the value within our land portfolio.
We also believe in the value of working together 
with our partners, suppliers and other stakeholders 
and are committed to supporting charities and 
local community groups. 
What makes us different
Capturing value
We have a relentless focus on value at every stage 
of our business model and this is ingrained into the 
Taylor Wimpey mindset. We also balance our 
desire to improve quality with a focus on making 
our assets work harder for us and our stakeholders.
We actively review every site, both new and old, 
through our value improvement meetings which 
are held quarterly and are tracked centrally. This 
allows us to benchmark our success and identify 
opportunities for further improvement, ranging 
from re-planning of sites to redesign and selective 
enhancements to our specification. We are 
committed to not only delivering what we set out 
to do but, by delivering more, instilling a discipline 
of capturing inflation. In the year, we achieved a 
1.7 percentage points margin upside on 
completions from land acquired since 2009, 
compared with the expected margin at the 
point of acquisition.
Higher return potential
It is important to also develop approaches that 
enable us to control land in a capital-light way, 
without unduly burdening the business. This ‘light 
touch’ improves our returns, frees money for other 
investment and reduces risk in the event of 
negative changes in the market. Taking this 
approach can also help if, and when, there is 
greater competition in high growth areas. A good 
example of this can be found within our Major 
Developments business. More information can be 
found within the case study on page 35. 
Partnerships
We strive to be an open, transparent and 
responsive company for all our stakeholders and 
to work with them to understand and address the 
wider social, economic and environmental impacts 
resulting from our operations.
We look to optimise the value of each site not only 
during the initial acquisition process, but throughout the 
planning and development stages so that the original 
value is not only protected but enhanced.

Case study
The fourth annual Taylor Wimpey 
Challenge took place in the Lake 
District in May 2017, with around 
400 staff from across the regional 
businesses in the UK and Spain 
participating. As with the previous 
challenges, this latest team-focused 
fundraising event was organised in 
partnership with the Youth 
Adventure Trust (YAT), which 
provides adventure camps and day 
activities for disadvantaged young 
people. As a result of our teams 
fundraising efforts more than £171k 
was donated to the YAT and a 
selection of charities local to our 
regional businesses. 
Optimising Value
How is Taylor Wimpey 
investing in research 
and innovation? 
Through Project 2020, our research 
initiative, we are exploring different 
approaches to meet the changing needs 
and aspirations of our customers, improve 
efficiency in construction and reduce the 
environmental impact of the homes we 
build. For example, following our design 
competition with the RIBA, we will be 
building a series of prototype homes 
incorporating sustainable build technologies 
and off-site production techniques.

Taylor Wimpey plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Strategic Report Efficiency
During 2017 we achieved an average annual 
return on net operating assets** of 32.4% 
(2016: 30.7%) which is ahead of our medium term 
target of 30% as set out in May 2016.
We have improved our UK net operating asset 
turn
†
* to 1.52 times (2016: 1.46 times), benefiting 
from a low land cost as a percentage of average 
selling price in the short term owned landbank, as 
a result of higher margin land acquired in recent 
years and increased strategic pipeline conversion. 
The higher proportion of strategic land conversion 
results in higher work in progress spend, due to 
these sites generally requiring greater 
infrastructure investment.
Charity
We are committed to supporting charities and 
local community groups in the areas in which we 
operate. We believe that as a responsible 
business, we must actively contribute to helping 
others whether financially, with our time, energy or 
expertise. We aim to be an aspirational 
housebuilding brand that is recognised for the 
good that is given back to our local communities 
by our employees. Our primary goal is to genuinely 
improve the position of the causes that we 
support. The secondary goal is to engage our 
employees in these activities as we recognise it is 
good for their development and self-awareness. 
Whilst there are a large number of worthy projects 
and causes, we have to focus to make sure that 
we are effective. 98% of Taylor Wimpey staff 
believe that Taylor Wimpey is committed to being 
an ethical and responsible company, according to 
our employee survey.
During 2017, we continued our partnership with 
our national charities as well as local charity 
partners across the UK. Our six national charities 
are the Youth Adventure Trust, End Youth 
Homelessness, Crisis, CRASH, St Mungo’s and 
Foundations Independent Living Trust. Our 
national charity partners are selected by our 
Charity Committee, with regional charities selected 
by our regional businesses.
In total, during 2017 we donated and fundraised 
over £1 million for registered charities (2016: over 
£875k), in addition to c.£90k for other 
organisations, such as scout groups and various 
local community causes (2016: c.£159k). More 
information about our local sponsorships and 
charity partnerships can be found within our 
Sustainability Report, which will be published on 
our website in March 2018.
Our KPIs
Contribution per  
legal completion
Objective
We strive to maximise the level of contribution 
per home sold.
Definition
Revenue, net of incentives, less build costs, 
land costs and direct selling costs, divided by 
the number of homes completed (excluding 
joint ventures).
Why is it key to our strategy?
Our strategy is focused on value and we 
continue to prioritise both short and long term 
margin performance. Increasing the contribution 
per plot is a key driver to achieving this.
Forward order book as a  
percentage of completions
Objective
We look to maintain a strong order book.
Definition
The number of homes in our year end order 
book, expressed as a percentage of the 
number of homes completed during the year 
(excluding joint ventures).
Why is it key to our strategy?
A strong order book provides our customers 
with good visibility and provides greater stability 
for business planning and enhances our ability 
to deliver the best experience for customers 
whilst driving the most value for shareholders.
Case study 
Since its creation in 2015, Major Developments 
has focused on the complex, mostly public land, 
mixed use opportunities across the UK, specifically 
with a high return and a lower risk structure. The 
business works hard to seek acquisition structures 
that require low upfront capital investment, offering 
reduced land risk, and therefore reduced exposure 
to longer term market challenges, enabling us to 
create additional value, whilst further reducing 
cyclical risk. In October 2017, the business 
announced its most recent development which is 
a joint venture with Wandsworth London Borough 
Council for the regeneration of Winstanley and 
York Road Estates that will provide more than 
2,200 new homes, in addition to significant new 
amenities and facilities for the local community.

taylorwimpey.co.uk Risk management and mitigation
Group Material Risk Register
The Material Risk Register is maintained by the 
GMT and is also reviewed by the Audit 
Committee with the promotion, removal or 
change of risks before consideration by the 
Board. Views are collated from the bottom up 
Business Unit (BU) risk registers and a top 
down view of risk formed from horizon 
scanning the macro-economic environment, 
the political landscape and developments in 
specific areas of uncertainty relating to the 
business or the wider markets within which we 
operate. Each material risk is assessed as to its 
likely impact based on the Group’s standard 
methodology, and risk items promoted or 
removed as appropriate.
Forecast and Planning Process
All BU risk registers are re-evaluated and 
completed as part of the formal planning 
process every six months. Each BU 
re-assesses with their own Senior Management 
Team, the risk landscape that the business 
faces and the risk register is then updated to 
reflect latest forward views.
Principal Risks and Uncertainties
The Board, supported by the GMT and the 
Audit Committee, identify the Principal Risks 
based on the assessment of the Material Risk 
Register. The Principal Risks will be disclosed 
with the half and full year results. Feedback 
regarding changes to Principal Risks is 
provided in detail to the risk owners who have 
been identified to manage and be primarily 
responsible for the specific risk on behalf of 
the Group.
Business Unit Risk Register
All items reported in the BU risk registers are 
reviewed for individual risks of note and for 
risk-themes which may arise across the Group. 
A summary of BU risks is assessed by the 
GMT, with significant items promoted for 
discussion by the Audit Committee. The 
assessment includes a comparison of the 
risk-rating of the individual items over time.
The successful management of risk is essential to enable the Group to deliver 
its strategic objectives. Our risk management and internal control framework 
defines the procedures that manage and mitigate risks facing the business, 
rather than eliminate risk altogether and can only provide reasonable and not 
absolute assurance against material misstatement or loss.
Our risk management framework includes risk registers that are maintained at 
all organisational levels throughout the business, which detail the risks faced 
by the Group, its operating companies and the central teams that support the 
business and external stakeholders. The registers identify key operational, 
financial and strategic risks to the business, with strategic risks considered 
and identified as part of the business planning process. Our risk registers take 
into account the significance of health, safety and environmental issues (HSE), 
together with social and governance matters relating to the Group and use a 
standardised methodology for the assessment of risk.
The standard methodology used in risk management requires each identified 
risk to be assessed and measured according to a risk matrix. This matrix 
considers the potential impact of each risk, (whether financial, reputational, 
HSE etc), the likelihood of the event occurring, together with mitigating actions 
and hence the remaining or residual risk. Our risk registers are refreshed on an 
ongoing basis as part of our financial planning cycle. The registers feed into a 
formal risk assessment that identifies the Principal Risks and Uncertainties (see 
pages 38 to 41) and other key risks which are monitored closely, and allows 
both the Audit Committee and the Board to re-evaluate the identified risks 
facing the Group. Our Sustainability and Climate Change Risk and 
Opportunity Register highlights the material risks and opportunities facing the 
Company in relation to sustainability and climate change and forms part of our 
Corporate Risk Management Framework. More information is provided in our 
Sustainability Report 2017.
As with any business, Taylor Wimpey faces risks and uncertainties in the course of its day to day operations. It is 
only by effectively identifying and managing these risks that we are able to deliver on our medium term targets 
(2016-2018) of an average operating profit* margin of c.22%, an average annual return on net operating 
assets** of 30% and a total of £1.3 billion of dividends to be paid in cash to shareholders over the period.

Risk Materiality Process
The Board determines the nature and extent of the Principal Risks it is willing to take in achieving its strategy, 
whilst maintaining sound risk management and internal control systems.
The current risk profile is within our tolerance range and overall is described as:
The Group is willing to accept a moderate level of risk in order to deliver financial returns. There may be occasions where these risks could have a moderate 
adverse impact to the Group, be it financially or operationally, although it is considered that the effect could be mitigated through management actions.
The Board oversees the risk management and internal control framework of 
the Group. The Chief Executive is responsible for implementing any necessary 
improvements, with the support of the GMT. In line with the UK Corporate 
Governance Code, the Board holds formal risk reviews at least half yearly and 
also routinely considers risk at each Board Meeting as appropriate. The Board 
reviews the risk profile of the Group and the significant risks with the 
mitigating factors.
At the Board meeting in February 2018, the Board completed its annual 
assessment of risks. This followed the Audit Committee’s formal assessment 
of risk, which was supported by the detailed risk assessment by the GMT, 
and their review of the effectiveness of internal controls. The key risks affecting 
the Group were identified and agreed with the Board.
Other key risks
In addition to the principal industry related risks set out in the following pages, 
we also monitor closely several other key internal and external factors. These 
could be risks with increasing potential impact or likelihood which are added 
to our watch list, or risks arising as a result of a combination of unlikely events, 
which together create a major event. These include factors that may affect our 
reputation and which can come from many sources. The Group considers risk 
from a wider technology and cyber perspective, and we are delivering a 
programme of works across the business to reduce our exposure to 
non-compliance with the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) 
which is implemented in May 2018. We continue to invest in our technology 
controls and services to mitigate the increasing cyber threats. The Group also 
considers the potential impact to the business in the event that our customers’ 
buying-experience or any of our homes are below our high standards. Our 
enhanced customer service processes and departments were established in 
2016, and once fully embedded, will significantly help to ensure that the quality 
of our homes is delivered as promised to our customers. 
Our customers and our corporate obligation are at the heart of Taylor 
Wimpey’s cultural values, which were launched to all employees in 2016. 
The enhanced Customer Journey is in place and we have focused heavily 
on product quality. However, during late 2016, some customers expressed 
concern about certain leasehold homes which are subject to ground rents that 
double every ten years until the 50
th
 year, at which point the rent is capped. 
This lease structure was introduced on some new developments by 
Taylor Wimpey in good faith in 2007 until late 2011, since when our new 
Risk Category
Group Appetite for Risk
Our description of the Group’s 
risk appetite is the foundation of 
our Risk Management framework. 
We have identified operational 
categories against which both our 
current risk profile and our risk 
tolerance range have been 
defined. Certain risk categories 
are dependent on where we 
believe we are in the cycle, and 
may adjust accordingly. In 
defining our risk appetite, the 
Board has taken into account the 
expectations of the company’s 
shareholders, regulators and 
other stakeholders.
Current risk profile Risk tolerance range 
developments have used leases with RPI-based ground rent clauses, which 
have become the industry norm. During the year, we reviewed the terms of 
these leases. The doubling clauses are considered to be entirely legal, clearly 
set out in the lease documentation and all our customers received 
independent legal advice as part of the standard conveyancing process. That 
said, it became clear that the impact of these rent review clauses was causing 
some of our customers understandable concern, and we resolved that these 
doubling clauses were not consistent with our cultural values. We have 
implemented the Taylor Wimpey Ground Rent Review Assistance Scheme 
(GRRAS), for our customers who wish to alter the terms of the doubling lease 
to materially less expensive terms based on RPI, with the Group bearing the 
financial cost of doing so. 
The Government has recently launched a consultation on leasehold 
properties, and this may result in changes to future ground rent structures. 
Whilst our business model, like most other volume housebuilders, is to 
transfer the freehold, management and upkeep of apartment and other 
developments to third party organisations, we note that potential changes 
may arise from the consultation.
In the current economic climate and with the structural shortage of housing 
supply in the UK, the Government and the main political parties have housing 
high on their agendas. The housebuilding industry is facing increased scrutiny 
and pressure from a number of sources, including social media and pressure 
groups, with the potential for greater oversight from Government through a 
Design Champion and a single Housing Ombudsman. We endeavour to 
deliver both the letter and the spirit of regulations and maintain this same 
ethos in our relationships with our customers. 
Following the tragic fire at Grenfell Tower in London in June 2017, we 
conducted an internal review into our current and historic developments, 
working, as appropriate with building owners, management companies, 
independent fire safety experts and local fire and rescue services. On sites 
where there are tall buildings with Aluminium Composite Material cladding, we 
sought advice from independent fire safety experts, and, where required, have 
put in place additional measures to ensure that the buildings are fully 
compliant with the Government’s guidance on interim fire safety measures. 
We welcome the commissioning of the Hackitt Review, and look forward to 
working positively with Government and other agencies to ensure that the 
outcomes are effective and appropriate for the long term.

Risk Relevance to strategy Potential impact on KPIs Mitigation Progress in 2017
A Government policy and 
planning regulations
The National Planning Policy Framework 
(NPPF) and the Localism Act 2011 are well 
established, although are insufficient to 
deliver greater housing availability for the 
UK. Additional initiatives and legislative and 
regulatory amendments have been 
signalled by a Housing White Paper, 
published in February 2017, with 
consultations continuing through the year 
and into 2018. Consultation on 
amendments to the NPPF is expected in 
spring 2018.
Since April 2013, the Government-backed 
Help to Buy (HtB) scheme has helped to 
fund the home deposit for certain 
homebuyers. The Government has 
announced the scheme’s extension to 
2021, however, there is potential for 
change to the scheme rules, for both the 
buyer and the seller, and ultimately its 
discontinuation.
The Housing White Paper and changes to 
the HtB scheme could have a disruptive 
effect on the planning system, sales rates, 
site mixes and customer behaviour.
The Review of Building Regulations and 
Fire Safety, headed by Dame Judith Hackitt 
(the Hackitt Review) following the Grenfell 
fire tragedy in June 2017, is expected to 
deliver its final report in late spring 2018. 
While looking primarily at the fire safety of 
tall buildings, the review is wide ranging, 
taking in the regulatory frameworks around 
the design, construction and management 
of buildings, the advice and guidance that 
supports those regulatory frameworks and 
the responsibilities of those involved. This 
may have a significant impact on the 
regulatory framework. Changes to building 
regulations are usually forward looking in 
terms of implementation and it is expected 
that recommended changes will generally 
need to be complied with in required 
timeframes.
Sir Oliver Letwin is undertaking a review (the 
Letwin Review) on the gap between 
planning permissions and starts on site. 
The review is ongoing and the conclusions 
of the review are expected to appear over 
the next few months.
Responsibility
Group Operations Director
Regional Managing Directors
Our ability to build great 
places to live is dependent 
upon creating site plans 
which inspire and delight our 
customers, delivered at an 
affordable price. Obtaining 
timely planning permissions 
and achieving other regulatory 
requirements and permits, is 
key to starting on site as soon 
as possible and home 
delivery.
There remains a risk of 
delayed or refused planning 
applications, increased 
timescales to the discharge of 
planning conditions and 
greater complexity around 
Section 106 since the 
introduction of the 
Community Infrastructure 
Levy (CIL).
As all elements of the 
anticipated changes from the 
Housing White Paper are 
clarified, and if the terms of 
HtB are amended, there 
could be a change in demand 
for specific products. In turn, 
this may lead to changes to 
site mixes, and to extended 
timeframes to gaining revised 
planning consents.
Unforeseen delays, our 
inability to obtain suitable 
planning consents and 
disruption from changes to 
planning regulations, could 
impact on the number or type 
of homes that we build.
With the introduction of 
regulation from the Housing 
White Paper, we may be 
required to meet higher levels 
of planning obligations, so 
incurring additional costs.
The locally produced CIL 
charge schedules may 
increase costs, impacting the 
viability of developments in 
our short term landbank. 
Where CIL charges are not in 
place, there could be an 
impact on gaining planning 
consent or Judicial Review 
challenge. In addition, a CIL 
review from 2017 is still being 
considered and resulting 
changes may be disruptive, 
impacting volumes and 
contribution per plot.
Changes to Building 
Regulations on tall and other 
buildings, although likely to be 
limited in impact to the Group, 
could introduce delays to 
implementation and re-work 
to current and other sites and 
increased costs.
Together, these changes 
could have a detrimental 
impact on the contribution  
per plot.
Removal of HtB completely 
could see slower sales rate 
particularly from first time 
buyers, and potentially a 
greater number of smaller 
homes required by our 
customers.
We operate within our 
comprehensive community 
led planning strategy. This 
improves communications 
with all parties, but especially 
local communities, thereby 
enhancing our ability to deliver 
developments that meet local 
requirements.
We continually review 
changes to Building 
Regulations and supporting 
guidance.
We consult with Government 
agencies and opposition 
parties on housing policy, 
both directly and indirectly as 
a member of industry groups, 
to highlight potential issues 
and to understand any 
proposed changes to 
regulations and policy.
Our customer and community 
engagement strategy is 
embedded and having a 
positive effect. We have been 
successful in gaining planning 
consents throughout the year 
with particular emphasis on 
the conversion of the strategic 
land pipeline.
We continue to represent the 
Group, via the HBF, on 
broader planning and local 
plan matters, to ensure local 
plans are robust and CIL 
charge schedules are 
appropriate. We have met 
with Government officials on a 
number of occasions through 
the year including discussions 
on HtB.

B Impact of market 
environment on mortgage 
availability and demand
The cost of servicing a mortgage continues 
to be at historic lows. However, a change in 
business confidence, employment 
opportunities or significant changes in the 
Bank of England base rate that is not 
combined with wage growth could impact 
the demand for housing, which may also 
lead to lower selling prices.
The ability of first time buyers to purchase 
homes is constrained by changes in 
mortgage availability at the higher 
loan-to-value levels. The Government-
backed HtB scheme helps to fund the 
home-deposit for these and other 
homebuyers. £10 billion additional funding 
was announced at the Conservative Party 
Conference in 2017 to support the HtB 
scheme until its currently programmed end 
in 2021. There is potential for change to the 
scheme rules and ultimately its 
discontinuation.
Sustained growth in interest rates and low 
wage inflation could challenge mortgage 
affordability. Strict guidelines are in place for 
lenders to assess mortgage affordability if 
interest rates were to rise. Furthermore, the 
Bank of England has powers to set 
loan-to-value and debt-to-income limits for 
financial institutions selling residential 
mortgages.
Responsibility
UK Sales and Marketing Director
Regional Sales and Marketing Directors
The majority of the homes 
that we build are sold to 
individual purchasers who 
take on mortgages to finance 
their purchases.
Loss of economic confidence 
as a result of the terms the 
UK agrees on leaving the EU, 
may impact on demand for 
new build housing and sales 
prices. This may be tempered 
to some extent by the current 
imbalance between demand 
and supply. 
However, future decisions 
made by the Government 
around homebuyer initiatives, 
new legislation, stamp duty 
and the Bank of England 
about interest rates, are likely 
to create both risks and 
opportunities for 
homebuilders and their 
customers.
A reduction in demand for 
new homes below normal 
levels could negatively impact 
on both profit and cash 
generation. This would have 
an adverse effect on return on 
net operating assets and cash 
generation.
Our local teams select the 
locations and home designs 
that best meet the needs of 
the local community and 
customer demand in the 
present and future. We 
evaluate new outlet openings 
on the basis of local market 
conditions and regularly 
review the pricing and 
incentives that we offer.
We work closely with the 
financial services industry to 
ensure customers receive 
advice on the procurement of 
mortgage products.
We continue to promote the 
Government backed HtB 
scheme and our customers 
demonstrate strong demand 
for the scheme. We are 
monitoring usage of HtB by 
our customer base to 
understand how any change 
to the scheme, or its 
withdrawal, may impact the 
desired design and location of 
homes required in the future.
Throughout 2017 we have 
continued to develop good 
working relationships with 
established mainstream 
lenders and those wishing to 
increase volume within the 
new build market.
C
Material costs and 
availability of 
subcontractors
A continued increase in housing production 
may further strain the already reduced 
availability of skilled subcontractors and 
materials and put pressure on utility firms to 
keep up with the pace of installation. 
Further, leaving the EU could impact on the 
availability of skilled workers given the 
relatively large proportion of the labour 
force, particularly in the South East, that is 
from Eastern Europe. Together, this could 
result in build programme and completion 
delays and unexpected cost increases.
Responsibility
Group Operations Director
Head of Procurement
Regional Commercial Directors
We aim to commence work 
on new sites as soon as 
planning consents allow, to 
accelerate build progress and 
optimise return on capital 
employed. The majority of 
work performed on our sites 
is subcontracted, providing 
flexibility and supporting our 
strategy.
If the availability of 
subcontractors or materials is 
insufficient to meet demand, 
this could lead to longer build 
times and increased costs, 
thereby reducing profitability 
and return on capital 
employed.
Lack of skilled subcontractors 
could also result in higher 
levels of waste being 
produced from our sites and 
lower build quality.
We maintain regular contact 
with suppliers, negotiating 
contract volumes, pricing and 
duration. We provide high 
level and site-specific 
programme information to the 
subcontractor base to aid 
with demand planning.
When selecting our 
subcontractors, we consider 
competencies particularly in 
relation to health and safety, 
quality, previous performance 
and financial stability.
We are well underway with a 
project to take on more direct 
labour across the majority of 
trades.
We are assessing alternative 
build methods to reduce 
reliance on traditional brick 
and block techniques and 
resources. We work to 
address the skills shortage 
with apprenticeship schemes 
and the Construction Industry 
Training Board.
With the growth in 
housebuilding, availability of 
materials is generally in line 
with demand but there remain 
pinch points with key 
products such as bricks, 
blocks and roof tiles. The cost 
of these key products has 
risen significantly and whilst 
other material costs have 
been stable in 2017 we are 
experiencing more cost 
pressure coming into 2018. 
The supply of quality 
subcontractors and labour 
generally remains challenging. 
The Group has agreed 
product lines and volumes 
with key suppliers to mitigate 
long lead times and 
shortages.
We are continuing to trial 
several different build 
methods as alternatives to 
conventional brick and block.

D Ability to attract and retain 
high-calibre employees
Recruiting employees with inadequate skills 
or in insufficient numbers, or not being able 
to retain key staff with the right skills for the 
future, could have a detrimental impact on 
our business.
Responsibility
Group HR Director
Every employee managing people
Our business model requires 
significant input from skilled 
people to deliver quality 
homes and communities. 
There continues to be 
competition amongst 
employers in the 
housebuilding and 
construction industries for 
sector-specific staff. 
Shortages exist across the 
industry in the main manual 
trades and in certain 
managerial and professional 
occupations. This could 
impact our ability to achieve 
our strategic goals.
Not filling critical roles or 
having a significantly changing 
work force could lead to 
delays in build, quality issues, 
reduced sales levels, poor 
customer service and 
reduced profitability.
We monitor employee 
turnover levels closely and 
conduct exit interviews to 
identify any areas for 
improvement. We benchmark 
our remuneration to ensure 
that we are competitive within 
the industry.
Clear succession plans are in 
place for key roles within the 
Group. Our renewed 
approach to succession 
planning enabled more 
internal candidates to be 
promoted to senior roles. We 
hold regular development 
reviews to identify training 
requirements.
We extended the 
management training and 
graduate programme in 
response to emerging gaps in 
our pipeline, leading to an 
increase in trainee and 
graduate numbers and the 
types of programme we offer.
2017 saw the trial of a new 
Academy for Customer 
Excellence, to improve the 
skills and confidence of our 
customer facing employees.
The Production Academy, 
launched in 2016, saw the 
first graduates and over 200 
site-based staff have 
progressed through the 
Academy or are currently 
completing the course. We 
have increased the numbers 
of apprentices, both direct 
and indirect, in the year.
E Land 
purchasing
The purchase of land of poor quality, at too 
high a price, or incorrect timing of land 
purchases in relation to the economic cycle 
could impact future profitability.
Responsibility
Divisional Managing Directors
Regional Managing Directors
Regional Land and Planning Directors
Strategic Land Managing Directors
Land is a valuable resource 
for the Group.
Limited availability of 
good-quality land at an 
attractive price throughout the 
housing cycle can lead to 
significant and unsustainable 
competition. The disciplined 
purchasing of land of the 
appropriate quality, on 
attractive terms and at the 
right time and scale in the 
economic cycle, will enhance 
the Group’s ability to deliver 
sustainable margins and 
return on capital employed 
through the cycle.
Purchasing poor quality or 
mispriced land, or incorrectly 
timing land purchases would 
have a detrimental impact on 
our profitability and return on 
capital employed.
Acquiring insufficient land 
would reduce our ability to 
actively manage our land 
portfolio and create value for 
shareholders.
Our land teams prepare 
annual Land Strategy 
documents to guide their land 
searches to match the needs 
of each individual business. 
They select and appraise 
each site, with the appraisal 
process ensuring that each 
project is financially viable, 
consistent with our strategy 
and appropriately authorised.
We strive to be the developer 
of choice, through a 
comprehensive approach 
encompassing land vendors, 
land agents, local councils 
and local communities.
Our strategic land teams work 
alongside regional businesses 
to identify and secure land 
with the potential for future 
development and to promote 
it through the planning 
system.
The short term land market 
remained benign throughout 
2017, albeit there is significant 
variation in competition for 
small sites compared with 
larger sites. We continued to 
invest in value-creating land 
opportunities, maintaining 
strong discipline on quality, 
margin and return on capital 
employed. 
We are mindful of external 
factors and continue to 
critically assess opportunities 
for robustness in changing 
circumstances. The strong 
level of conversion from the 
strategic pipeline means our 
reliance on purchasing short 
term land is diminished, 
providing some insulation 
from land price increases.

Taylor Wimpey plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Strategic Report Assessment of Prospects
We consider the long term prospects of the Group in light of our business 
model. Our strategy to deliver sustainable value is achieved through 
delivering high-quality homes in the locations where people want to live, 
with excellent customer service, whilst carefully managing our cost base 
and the Group’s balance sheet. Management re-evaluates the medium to 
long term strategy, in the light of external, economic and industry changes. 
If appropriate, management adapts the strategy accordingly, in light of 
changes; for example, for material changes in planning and the wider 
housing market fundamentals. The Group strategy is underpinned by our 
short term landbank, which supports 5.1 years of development at current 
completion levels. Additionally, the Group ensures a strong, long term 
supply of land, with its Strategic Land business promoting land through the 
constrained planning process. The Group has c. 8 years supply of land at 
current completion levels in its strategic land pipeline.
Viability Statement
In accordance with provision C.2.2 of the 2014 revision of the UK Corporate 
Governance Code, the Directors have assessed the prospects of the 
Company over a longer period than the 12 months required by the ‘Going 
Concern’ provision. Whilst our operating plan covers a period of three years, 
the Board conducted their viability assessment for a period of five years, 
which is an increase of two years since 2016, to better reflect the forecast 
period that the Board considers. The Company operates in a market which 
is prone to cyclicality, tending to follow the UK economic cycle. It is impacted 
by Government policy, planning regulation and the mortgage market. 
However, the Board considers that the Company has reasonable visibility 
over a five-year time horizon. This period aligns with the average build out 
time for a development phase from the point of land acquisition to final 
delivery to our customers. 
The viability assessment includes the Group’s income statement, balance 
sheet, cash flows, KPIs and debt covenants, and considers the potential 
impacts which may arise from the Principal Risks of the business as 
described on pages 38 to 41. It includes macro-economic and industry-
wide projections as well as matters specific to the Group.
The assessment considers sensitivity analysis on a series of realistically 
possible, but severe and prolonged, changes to principal assumptions. This 
downside scenario reflected the potential impact of declining customer 
confidence, disposable incomes, and higher interest rates as may be 
experienced as a secondary impact to the Group from the UK leaving the EU. 
As such, we reduced volumes by 30% and selling prices by 20% over the first 
two years, with no recovery. The assessment also reflects the potential 
consequences of changes to our Principal Risks, including an increase to build 
costs of 10% and an adverse price movement of 10% in the land market. We 
also considered mitigating actions, assuming continued investment in land, 
albeit at a reduced level, and the continued payment of the annual ordinary 
dividend of £150 million throughout the period. Based on the results of this 
analysis, the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Company will be 
able to continue in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due over the 
five-year period of their assessment.

F Site and product 
safety
Construction sites and 
operations can present risk to 
health and safety. Suitable 
and sufficient controls to 
eliminate or reduce the risk 
must be constantly 
implemented, monitored and 
measured. Unsafe practices 
by our employees or 
subcontractors, and unsafe 
product quality, have the 
potential to cause death or 
serious injury.
The fire at Grenfell Tower, the 
subsequent public scrutiny of 
the relevant regulations and 
the interim report of the 
Hackitt Review, have all 
brought to light that 
throughout the industry, 
cladding systems to tall 
buildings require review.
Responsibility
Director of Health, Safety and 
Environment
Group Operations Director
Group Director of Design
Every employee and 
subcontractor
Our operations involve, and 
interface with, a large number 
of people. This ranges from 
employees and 
subcontractors to customers 
and their families who live on, 
or visit, our sites each day. 
We want everyone to go 
home at the end of the day 
uninjured and healthy.
Although the majority of our 
developments comprise 
houses and low-rise 
apartment buildings, there are 
a number of buildings which 
are at or above 18 metres in 
height.
In addition to the potentially 
tragic personal impact of an 
accident on site or after 
customer completion, there is 
potential for legal proceedings 
and civil, financial penalties, 
reputational damage and 
delay to the site’s progress.
A comprehensive Health, Safety and 
Environmental (HSE) Management System 
is embedded throughout the business, 
supported by policies and procedures to 
ensure that we provide a safe and healthy 
working environment and build homes that 
comply with the required regulations.
We provide extensive HSE training for our 
employees and provide HSE inductions 
and regular Site Safe Briefings for our 
contractors and operatives.
‘Blue Hat’ support teams from our 
contractor base are integrated into our site 
management teams, where they assist our 
site managers to communicate the HSE 
ethos and support maintaining a safe site.
Following guidance from the Government’s 
Independent Expert Advisory Panel, we 
have identified all buildings over 18 metres 
(six storeys) constructed by or for Taylor 
Wimpey, which have Aluminium Composite 
Material (ACM). Where buildings have been 
identified with the ACM cladding system, 
we have notified the persons responsible 
for those buildings and have directed them 
to the interim mitigation advice from 
Government. 
Where appropriate, we have also followed 
Government advice in seeking independent 
professional advice on any further action 
that should be taken. 
All HSE issues are reviewed by the GMT on 
a timely basis and actions put in place to 
rectify issues and help prevent a 
recurrence.
We continue to compare very 
favourably with the UK 
housebuilding and 
construction industry in terms 
of site safety. Our Annual 
Injury Incidence Rate (AIIR) for 
reportable injuries is below the 
normal range for the industry. 
2017 saw an AIIR for 
reportable injuries at a record 
low of 152 per 100,000 
employees from 28 injuries 
(2016: 211 from 36 injuries), 
The number of injuries 
classed as major was  
54 in 2017 (53 in 2016). 
During 2017, as a result of 
our incident trend analysis, 
there was an increased focus 
on site housekeeping and our 
groundworks operations.
We have continued our 
‘supervising safely’ training, 
with over 4,820 groundworks 
supervisors trained and HSE 
training for our ‘Blue Hat’ 
support workers as part of 
our ‘Creating a Site Team 
Approach’ initiative.
In light of Government advice 
on tall buildings, we have 
undertaken expert reviews on 
a number of buildings.

Strategic Report The Group Financial Review is presented at Group level, which includes 
Spain, unless otherwise indicated. A short summary of the Spanish 
business follows.
Joint ventures are excluded from the operational review and are separated out 
in the Group Financial Review, unless stated otherwise.
Income statement
Group revenue increased by 7.9% to £ 3,965.2 million in 2017 
(2016: £3,676.2 million). This increase was driven by increased completions 
and improved selling prices in the UK. Group completions increased by 4.1% 
to 14,688 (2016: 14,112). 
Group gross profit of £1,033.0 million (2016: £939.9 million) increased by 
9.9% with the top line revenue growth partially offset by higher build costs. 
Gross profit includes positive contribution of £17.4 million (2016: £13.1 million) 
which represents previously written down inventory allocated to a plot which 
has subsequently resulted in a gross profit on completion. This can be due to 
revenue outperformance, cost efficiencies or product mix improvements. 
In 2017, 5% (2016: 5%) of the Group’s UK completions were from sites that 
had been previously impaired. In Spain, 35 plots (2016: 65) were completed 
that had previously been impaired. The Group anticipates that c.2% of UK 
2018 completions will come from sites that have been previously impaired.  
Adjusted operating profit* increased by 10.1% to £841.2 million 
(2016: £764.3 million), delivering an operating profit* margin of 21.2% 
(2016: 20.8%) from marginally improved overhead efficiency. 
The improvement in the UK was driven by improved selling prices, up 3.5% to 
£264k (2016: £255k), and UK volume growth of 4.2% to 14,387 completions 
(2016: 13,808). Average selling prices on private completions increased by 
3.5% to £296k (2016: £286k) in the UK, with this increase being in part as a 
result of our underlying shift to better quality locations and by capturing market 
sales price increases.
The UK land cost per unit sold remains unchanged at £45.4k (2016: £45.4k) 
in spite of the continued shift to better quality locations. Total UK land cost per 
completion as a percentage of selling prices was 17.2% (2016: 17.8%). 
Underlying build cost per unit in the UK increased to £143.7k (2016: £137.2k), 
driven by build cost inflation, the impact of higher infrastructure costs due to a 
higher proportion of strategic sites and further product quality improvements 
implemented during the year. Other direct costs and selling expenses per unit 
decreased marginally to £6.0k (2016: £6.2k), being 2.3% of total revenue 
(2016: 2.4%). UK contribution per completion increased by 5.8% to £69.3k 
for the period (2016: £65.5k). 
On a divisional basis the three UK operating divisions delivered a combined 
increase of 9.0% in operating profit* to £884.3 million (2016: £811.1 million). 
The North Division generated a 5.3% increase in operating profit* to 
£294.9 million (2016: £280.0 million), delivering a return on net operating 
assets** of 35.6%, 1.2 percentage points above prior year (2016: 34.4%). The 
Central and South West Division increased operating profit* by 13.3% to 
£318.0 million (2016: £280.7 million), improving the return on net operating 
assets** by 3.9 percentage points to 43.0% (2016: 39.1%). The London and

During the year, completions from joint ventures were 154 (2016: 73). The 
total order book value of joint ventures as at 31 December 2017 was 
£4 million (31 December 2016: £52 million), representing seven homes 
(31 December 2016: 100). The total 2017 year end order book reflects the 
development phasing at the two main joint venture sites, with delivery 
expected later in 2018. Our share of results of joint ventures in the period was 
£7.6 million (2016: £1.2 million).
Group net finance costs for the period were £29.2 million (2016: £30.9 million). 
Interest on overdraft, bank and other loans decreased by £4.9 million year on 
year and benefited from average net cash of £186.5 million (2016: net debt of 
£87.4 million). Unwind of the discount on land creditors was £20.7 million 
(2016: £17.7 million). The notional interest on the pension deficit was 
£5.9 million (2016: £6.1 million), with lower discount rates offset by higher 
average deficit level. 
Pre-exceptional profit before tax for the year from operations increased by 
10.7% to £812.0 million (2016: £733.4 million). The pre-exceptional tax 
charge was £151.7 million (2016: £143.7 million) with an underlying tax rate of 
18.7% (2016: 19.6%) that largely reflects the statutory tax rate in the UK. An 
exceptional tax credit of £25.0 million was recognised in respect of the 
£130.0 million exceptional provision recognised in the year.
This resulted in a profit, before exceptional items, for the year of £660.3 million 
(2016: £589.7 million), 12.0% up on the prior year due to the improvement in 
the operational result, lower net finance costs and lower effective tax rate.
Profit after tax was £555.3 million, down 5.8% on 2016, as a result of the 
exceptional charge relating to the leasehold review. We continue to view the 
provision, before tax, of £130 million as an appropriate estimate and we have 
made good progress in securing agreements with freeholders representing 
over 90% of historic leases with a ten-year doubling ground rent clause, to 
enable our customers to convert to a RPI-based structure, should they elect 
to participate in the assistance scheme we announced last April. We continue 
to work with the remaining freeholders to address the small number of 
remaining leases. The pace of usage of the leasehold provision will be 
dependent on the number of applications received from customers with these 
leases and the length of time it will take to change their lease terms with the 
relevant freeholder, and the approvals that may be required from individual 
mortgage providers and management companies as appropriate. It is 
expected that a large proportion will be utilised and paid in 2018 and 2019 
with the balance spread over a number of years.
Basic earnings per share was 17.0 pence (2016: 18.1 pence). The adjusted 
basic earnings per share
††
 was 20.2 pence (2016: 18.1 pence), up 11.6%.

taylorwimpey.co.uk Balance sheet
Net operating assets were £2,654.1 million (31 December 2016: £2,539.6 
million), reflecting a net investment of £61.7 million (2016: £113.3 million) year 
on year in land and work in progress (WIP), funded by profitability in the 
period, as well as a lower pension deficit. Return on net operating assets** 
increased by 1.7 percentage points to 32.4% (2016: 30.7%), mainly reflecting 
improved profitability while maintaining balance sheet discipline. Net operating 
asset turn
†
* increased to 1.53 times (2016: 1.48 times).
As at 31 December 2017, the UK held short term owned land valued at £2.3 
billion (2016: £2.3 billion), representing 56,619 plots (2016: 57,287). The total 
controlled short term landbank represented 18,230 plots (31 December 
2016: 18,947). The value of long term owned land decreased by 33.3% to 
£90 million (2016: £135 million), representing 26,836 plots (2016: 27,826), 
with a total controlled strategic pipeline of 90,409 plots (31 December 
2016: 80,190). Total potential revenue in the owned and controlled landbank 
increased to £47 billion in the period (31 December 2016: £42 billion), 
reflecting underlying price improvement and the increase in the scale of 
the landbank.
Average WIP per UK outlet at 31 December 2017 increased by 6.7% to 
£4.8 million (2016: £4.5 million), reflecting the high proportion of strategic land 
conversions which require a greater level of infrastructure investment, build 
cost inflation, and our continuing focus on delivering a consistent standard to 
our customers that has added, on average, two weeks to our production 
programmes. UK WIP turn
†
** reduced marginally to 2.95 times (2016: 3.00 
times) as a result. As at the balance sheet date, the Group held certain land 
and work in progress that had been written down to a net realisable value of 
£87.7 million (31 December 2016: £138.3 million) of which the balance in the 
UK was £69.9 million (31 December 2016: £119.6 million). As at 
31 December 2017, the associated write-downs were £93.3 million 
(31 December 2016: £147.0 million) of which the balance in the UK was 
£46.9 million (31 December 2016: £96.8 million) and principally relates to 
eight locations.
As at 31 December 2017, in the UK, 2% of our short term owned and 
controlled land was impaired (31 December 2016: 3%), with 83% of the short 
term owned and controlled landbank purchased after 2009, 63% of which 
was sourced through our strategic pipeline, resulting in a land cost to average 
selling price in the short term owned landbank of 14.8% (31 December  
2016: 15.4%).
We continue to use land creditors as a way of funding land acquisitions where 
this results in better return on our investment for longer dated delivery 
schemes and is value-enhancing for the business. Land creditors increased to 
£639.1 million (31 December 2016: £599.8 million) and, combined with net 
cash, resulted in adjusted gearing of 4.1% (31 December 2016: 8.1%). 
£326.6 million of the land creditors is expected to be paid within 12 months 
and £201.6 million between one and two years from balance sheet date. 
Included within the land creditor balance is £117 million of UK land overage 
commitments (31 December 2016: £130 million).
The mortgage debtor balance was £63.1 million at 31 December 2017 
(31 December 2016: £78.0 million), with the decrease due to redemption 
receipts of £18.5 million (31 December 2016: £21.1 million), offset by gains 
(including fair value adjustment) of £0.6 million and interest income of 
£2.9 million.
Our net deferred tax asset decreased to £29.3 million in the period 
(31 December 2016: £57.4 million) and relates principally to our pension deficit 
and our Spanish business. £9.4 million of this asset relates to the temporary 
differences of our Spanish business, including brought forward trading losses.  
Net assets at 31 December 2017 increased by 23.7% to £3,587.8 million, 
before dividends paid in the period, and by 8.2% overall year on year to 
£3,137.3 million (31 December 2016: £2,900.3 million). The net asset increase 
from 31 December 2016 was driven by profitability in the period and the 
pension actuarial assumptions and asset performance decreasing the pension 
deficit year on year, offset by the £450.5 million dividend paid in the year.
Pensions
As at 31 December 2017, the IAS 19 defined benefit pension scheme 
valuation is in surplus by £23.9 million. This is due to significant asset 
outperformance and changes in actuarial assumptions, the most significant of 
which relates to the life expectancy of scheme members. During 2017, a 
Medically Underwritten Mortality Study (MUMS) was commissioned in addition 
to using postcode analysis data which has historically formed the basis of 
member life expectancy.
The Study surveyed 3,206 members covering 45% of scheme liabilities, all 
between the ages of 55 and 80 and had a 58% response rate, representing 
£621 million of the scheme liabilities. The liability reduction resulting from this 
study has been partially offset by a 0.15% decrease in the discount rate with 
the balance of actuarial assumptions staying broadly stable. Due to the rules 
of the scheme, this surplus cannot be recovered by the Group and therefore a 
deficit of £63.7 million has been recognised on the balance sheet under 
IFRIC14 (the limit on a defined benefit asset, minimum funding requirements 
and their interaction). This deficit is equal to the present value of the remaining 
committed payments under the 2013 triennial valuation. The Group continues 
to work closely with the Trustees in managing pension risks, including 
management of interest rate, inflation and longevity risks. The Scheme assets 
are approximately 80% hedged against changes in both interest rates and 
inflation expectations on the Scheme’s long term, ‘self-sufficiency’ basis. The 
Scheme also benefits from a bulk annuity contract which covers some of the 
largest liabilities in the Scheme, providing protection against interest rate, 
inflation and longevity risk. In 2017 we paid £23.1 million in pension 
contributions (2016: £23.1 million).
During 2017 we engaged with the Pension Trustees on the triennial valuation 
of the pension scheme as at 31 December 2016. The agreed technical 
provisions deficit at 31 December 2016 was £222 million, which has reduced 
to c.£30 million as at 31 December 2017 due to the liability hedging 
programme in place as well as continued asset performance. A four-year 
recovery plan has been agreed with the Trustees in principle for contributions 
from 1 April 2018 moving to £40 million per annum with a funding mechanism 
that will be tested on a quarterly basis such that should the scheme reach a 
technical provisions surplus, further contributions will be suspended and only 
recommence if the funding level falls below 96% given how well capitalised 
the scheme is.

Cash flow
Net cash increased to £511.8 million at 31 December 2017 from 
£364.7 million at 31 December 2016, despite returning £450.5 million to 
shareholders by way of dividends in the year (2016: £355.9 million). This 
improvement in net cash is largely as a result of strong performance in 
underlying trading and maintaining balance sheet discipline. 
Net land spend, net of the movement in land creditors, was £645.6 million 
(2016: £583.2 million) and we invested the sum of £2,386.7 million in work in 
progress in the period (2016: £2,269.8 million). In 2017, we paid £5.1 million in 
interest costs (2016: £13.5 million). During 2017, we paid £126.7 million in 
corporate tax (2016: £71.0 million), reflecting the profit and loss charge. 
£13.3 million was spent during the year to acquire shares for satisfying future 
share scheme awards (31 December 2016: £10.6 million).
In the 12 months to 31 December 2017 we converted 87.5% of operating 
profit* into operating cash flow**** (2016: 81.4%).
Financing structure
At 31 December 2017 our committed borrowing facilities were £638.7 million 
with an average maturity of 2.6 years. Average net cash for 2017 was 
£186.5 million (2016: £87.4 million net debt).
On 14 February 2018, we completed an amendment and extension of the 
£550 million revolving credit facility to mature in 2023 on improved terms with 
an option to extend for a further two years. This extends the average maturity 
of the committed borrowing facilities to 5.2 years
Spain
The Spanish housing market remained positive throughout 2017. We 
completed 301 homes in 2017 (2016: 304) at an average selling price of 
€352k (2016: €358k). The total order book as at 31 December 2017 was 329 
homes (31 December 2016: 293 homes).
The Spanish business delivered a significantly improved operating profit* of 
£26.8 million for 2017 (2016: £20.6 million) and an operating profit* margin of 
28.5% (2016: 22.0%) as a greater proportion of delivery is from high-quality 
locations acquired more recently and as we see the benefits of an improving 
wider market environment. Looking ahead, we believe the business is well 
positioned for further growth in 2018.  
Going concern
The Directors remain of the view that the Group’s financing arrangements and 
balance sheet strength provide both the necessary facilities and covenant 
headroom to enable the Group to conduct its business for at least the next 
12 months. Accordingly, the consolidated financial statements are prepared 
on a going concern basis.
Accounting standards
The consolidated financial statements have been produced in accordance 
with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as endorsed and 
adopted for use in the EU. There have been no changes to IFRS during 2017 
that have a material impact on the Group results.

2 Directors’ Report: Governance
Dear Shareholder
In my capacity as Chairman of the Board, I am very pleased to again have 
this opportunity to make a personal statement on the Company’s approach 
to corporate governance.
Firstly, I would like to emphasise again that the Board continues to take 
corporate governance very seriously and has been able to demonstrate this 
over many years with full compliance with the UK Corporate Governance 
Code (the Code). The requirements of the Code are summarised in the table 
on page 53 where we have included a signpost directing you to the relevant 
page which sets out in detail how the Company has complied with the various 
provisions of the Code. Where possible, the Company has consistently 
sought to comply with planned improvements to the Code, and with wider 
governance initiatives, often in advance of their formal application to our 
reporting years. This proactive approach is demonstrated by the 
establishment during the year of our National Employee Forum, in response to 
the Government’s employee voice initiative and which is likely to form part of 
the revised Code scheduled to apply to companies with effect from 
1 January 2019. The Board recognises the importance of considering the 
Company’s responsibilities and duties to both its shareholders and its broader 
stakeholder group and this has been part of our culture and decision making 
process for many years. The Directors’ duties of s.172 of the Companies Act 
2006 help to underpin the good governance which is at the heart of what we 
do and the Board receives regular briefings and updates on corporate 
governance at its Board and Committee meetings.
This report on corporate governance aims to set out and explain in clear terms 
the governance-related processes and procedures in place at Taylor Wimpey 
which we believe are essential for the delivery of the long term success of the 
Company. It is these processes that ensure we comply with all applicable 
laws and regulations as well as, of course, meeting the requirements of 
relevant stakeholders, including our shareholders and their representative 
bodies with whom we are always very pleased to engage and we very much 
appreciate their constructive and helpful approach.
Culture, values and ethics
The Board strongly believes that good governance should be focused not 
only on how the Board itself operates effectively but also, and very importantly, 
on the culture within which all of our businesses operate and conduct 
themselves on a day to day basis. The culture, values and ethics set out in the 
Chief Executive’s Statement on page 12 are set by the Board and then led in 
our operations by the Chief Executive and the rest of our Executive and senior 
management teams. The principles of good governance are embedded 
throughout the organisation and by way of example, manifest themselves in 
a number of different ways, including the following:
 – An absolute and non-negotiable requirement to ensure the health and 
safety of our employees, customers, subcontractors, suppliers and 
visitors to our offices and developments. Please see page 18.
 – The requirement to observe good business practice, including abiding by 
all applicable laws and regulations that relate to our business. Please see 
page 60.
 – The provision of mandatory training on key legislation and regulations to 
all of our business units.
 – Our Group-wide Operating Framework control document setting out 
delegated authority limits.
 – A system of controls and checks underpinned by a rigorous Internal 
Audit Department and overseen by the Audit Committee.
 – Regular and embedded risk assessment and monitoring processes. 
Please see page 64.
 – Encouraging and investigating any disclosures made either directly or 
through an independent whistleblowing hotline. Please see page 66.
Governance developments during the period
There were a number of significant developments in the area of corporate 
governance during 2017.
Kevin Beeston, Chairman
Governance highlights for 2017

Governance Code. Please see page 53.

meet the new statutory reporting of payment terms during 2018.

Corporate Governance
Good governance is 
at the heart of what we do Perhaps the most important of these was the publication in August of the 
Government’s proposals for Corporate Governance reforms in certain key 
areas, in respect of which the Company has already taken action to address 
some of these areas, as set out below:
 – Requiring annual reporting and narrative around CEO pay relative to the 
workforce. Please see page 88.
 – Demonstrating how the Directors met the requirement of s.172 of the 
Companies Act for them to promote the success of the Company for its 
members whilst also having regard to long-term success; other 
stakeholders’ interests (including employees; shareholders; customers; 
suppliers and the wider communities in which our business operates); 
the impact on the environment; and maintaining high standards of 
ethics. Please see page 51.
 – Strengthening the voice of employees at Board level which I have 
already mentioned. Please see pages 23, 51, 81 and 95.
Key amongst these developments is the requirement to clearly explain how 
the Board led an appropriate level of engagement with stakeholders in order 
to meet its duty under s.172 of the Companies Act to promote the success 
of the Company whilst taking into account the interests of other 
stakeholders. Details of this engagement during 2017 and into 2018, 
together with our actions taken in response, are set out on page 51.
The UK Financial Reporting Council (FRC) has published its proposals for a 
review of the Code, focusing particularly on the culture of the Company; on 
succession planning at Board level; on proposals arising from the 
Government’s consultation during 2017 on executive pay, Directors’ duties 
and Board composition; and wider recommendations to promote good 
corporate governance. The Board welcomes these proposals and will 
explain in next year’s Annual Report and Accounts what changes were 
made to the Code and how the Company has responded to them.
The Investment Association published its views on how companies should 
seek to respond to the Government’s initiatives towards increasing 
productivity, including greater recognition of the importance of ‘human 
capital’ and a clearer focus on training and development. Details of our 
initiatives in this regard appear on pages 22 to 23, 40 and 69.
The aim of these initiatives is to ensure that good governance goes deeper 
than simply ‘box ticking’. The Board reviewed and welcomed these 
initiatives as they are designed to help to provide shareholders and all of our 
stakeholders with increased assurance that the Company is being managed 
with their best interests firmly in mind, whilst also taking account of other 
relevant interests and the impact of the Company’s activities on the 
wider community.
The Board welcomes the Government’s proposals and will respond to 
them, to the extent not already done so, as they are implemented.
Appointments and succession
There was no change to the composition of the Board during 2017.
On 10 January 2018, after a review of the Board’s composition by the 
Nomination Committee, the Company announced a number of changes:
Gwyn Burr was appointed as an Independent Non Executive Director on 
1 February 2018. Gwyn’s executive experience over 25 years, principally in 
customer service in the retail sector, will add to the Board’s skill sets in this 
area. Gwyn has excellent experience gained from both her previous executive 
positions and also from her non executive roles, all of which will help to further 
strengthen the Board’s expertise, including our ongoing focus on customer 
service. I am delighted to welcome Gwyn to the Board and to support 
Resolution 12 at the 2018 Annual General Meeting proposing her election by 
shareholders, in respect of which more details appear on page 156.
Rob Rowley will stand down as an Independent Non Executive Director and 
as the Senior Independent Director after the conclusion of the 2018 AGM on 
26 April 2018. I should like to express both mine and the Board’s gratitude 
to Rob for his long and valued contribution to the Company’s progress and 
stewardship. Over the past eight years he has provided wise counsel as 
Senior Independent Director to myself as Chairman, careful oversight of the 
Audit Committee and an invaluable contribution to the Board. We wish him 
all the very best for the future.
Kate Barker will be the Company’s Senior Independent Director following the 
AGM, and brings to the role a wide range of experience, both of the Company 
and of wider corporate, economic and stewardship principles.
As reported on page 62, Humphrey Singer was appointed as Chairman of the 
Audit Committee on 10 January 2018 and brings wide experience of financial 
reporting and compliance to the role, including from his prior period of service 
on the Audit Committee prior to this appointment.
The Nomination Committee regularly reviews the composition; balance; skills; 
and experience of the Board and concluded throughout 2017 and, following 
the changes set out above announced earlier in 2018, that the balance and 
composition of the Board, which includes a majority of Independent Non 
Executive Directors, will continue to provide the right blend of experience, 
expertise and challenge to ensure good governance so as to enable the 
Company to successfully implement its strategy.
Board evaluation
It is a key requirement of good governance that an annual evaluation is carried 
out to ensure that the Board itself operates effectively. In line with the Code 
requirement that the evaluation be externally-facilitated at least every three years, 
the evaluation for 2017 was facilitated by Manchester Square Partners. Full 
details of the evaluation methodology and its outcome are set out on page 61.
Diversity
Diversity and inclusivity has continued to be a key item on the overall UK 
governance agenda during 2017, as the Company works towards the target 
introduced by Lord Davies of Abersoch’s review for the proportion of women 
on each FTSE 350 company’s board to increase from the current 25% target 
to 33% by 2020. The Board also welcomes the Hampton Alexander Review 
which proposes to increase Board and senior leadership diversity, more 
details of which are set out on page 71. The Board very much welcomes 
these increased targets which are designed to give greater impetus to the 
progress of enhanced gender diversity on PLC boards. This, together with 
other aspects of diversity, such as the latest proposals from the FRC to 
require greater consideration of ethnic and social diversity when planning 
Board appointments, is very much in the thinking of the Nomination 
Committee when reviewing the balance and composition of the Board and 
the structuring of talent development initiatives across the Group.
The Company fully recognises the importance of diversity and its policy is to 
appoint or promote, as appropriate, the best person for the role in question 
without taking account of factors such as educational or professional 
backgrounds save as appropriate for the position; age; gender; ethnicity; or 
disability. The objective of this policy is to ensure that diversity is built into the 
Company’s appointment and promotion process and that only relevant 
factors are taken into account when considering such matters. The policy 
has been implemented through training sessions on unconscious bias for 
management teams throughout the Company’s business and its head office 
functions. Progress to date in this area is set out on page 70.
Conclusion
I believe that your Board remains effective and continues to work well.  
I am confident that the Board has the right balance of skills, expertise and 
professionalism to continue to deliver strong governance whilst allowing the 
Executive Directors to implement and deliver the strategy (as set out on  
page 13) within the strong culture that we have worked hard to establish. 
Whilst I am also pleased with the Board’s activity and approach with regard  
to corporate governance, we continually look for ways to learn and improve.
As ever, I very much look forward to meeting with shareholders at the Annual 
General Meeting on 26 April 2018 and, as always, along with all of your 
Directors (who will all be present at the AGM), remain available to answer  
or respond to your questions, concerns and suggestions at any time.

Stakeholder engagement
We actively encourage engagement with our shareholders and other stakeholders.
As previously mentioned, the Directors are required by law to act in a 
way that promotes the success of the Company for the benefit of 
shareholders as a whole. In so doing the Company must also have 
regard to wider expectations of responsible business behaviour, such as 
having due regard to the interests of its employees and the impact of the 
Company’s business on the community in which it operates, and also 
the wider environment.
During the year, the Board specifically discussed this requirement on 
several occasions and concluded that its existing processes and 
decision making, properly take into account both the duty to 
shareholders and the remaining considerations with regard to other 
stakeholder related matters as referred to above.
Engagement with stakeholders during the year took place as 
described below.
Engagement with our shareholders 
The Board actively seeks and encourages engagement with shareholders 
including its major institutional shareholders and shareholder bodies. The 
Board fully supports the principles of the UK Corporate Governance Code 
and also welcomes and acknowledges the Stewardship Code, both of 
which aim to foster a more proactive governance role by major 
shareholders. The Board has put in place arrangements designed to 
facilitate contact with shareholders concerning business, governance, 
remuneration and other relevant topics. This provides the opportunity for 
meetings between shareholders and the Chairman, the independent Non 
Executive Directors (including the Senior Independent Director) as well as 
the Chief Executive, Group Finance Director, Group Legal Director and 
Company Secretary and other executives as appropriate, in order to 
establish a mutual understanding of objectives. The Company also 
operates a structured programme of investor relations, based on formal 
announcements and publications covering the Full Year and Half Year 
results. In addition, the Chairman meets with the Company’s institutional 
shareholders from time to time, both proactively and upon request, in 
order to discuss the Company and its performance, governance and 
remuneration policies. As set out in the Remuneration Report, the 
Remuneration Committee undertakes a consultation exercise each year 
and as part of this exercise, the Committee Chairman also engages 
directly with shareholders and their representative bodies. More details  
are set out on pages 74 and 81.
The Company is, of course, also always very pleased to hear from and 
engage with our private shareholders and has, for example, previously met 
with the United Kingdom Shareholders Association to facilitate contact 
with shareholders located in the North of England, which took place at a 
regional office and included site visits.
What our shareholders have asked us this year
During 2017 the Company held 153 meetings with shareholders holding in 
aggregate around 35% of the Company’s shares, taking the form of group 
meetings; one to one meetings; conference telephone calls; site visits; the 
AGM - before, during and after the meeting; at the announcement of the 
Company’s full year and half year results. Key themes discussed included:
 – Current trading, market demand and house price outlook.
 – The Company’s medium term strategy and business model.
 – The likely impact of Government policy.
 – The land market, build costs and labour availability.
 – The Company’s financial targets and dividend policy.
 – The mortgage market.
All Directors receive formal reports and briefings during the year about the 
Company’s investor relations programme and receive detailed feedback 
through surveys, direct contact and also other means. This enables all 
Directors to develop an understanding of the views of major shareholders 
about the Company.
The Board encourages all shareholders to vote at the AGM, which is 
attended by all Directors. The Notice of AGM, including details of all 
resolutions to be proposed at the meeting, is set out on page 151.
Engagement with our employees 
The Board was pleased to introduce during 2017 a National Employee 
Forum (‘NEF’) with the purpose of giving employees a ‘voice’ with regard 
to key matters that are being considered. The NEF builds on our existing 
network of Employee Consultation Committees and consists of elected 
employees from across the business and from a number of different office 
and site based disciplines. Early meetings have included discussions on 
customer service, the Modern Slavery Act and health and wellbeing which 
have all generated a good level of healthy debate. The meetings are 
attended by a member of the Group Management Team and so far have 
been attended by either the Group Legal Director and Company Secretary 
or by the Group Human Resources Director. Going forward, the meetings 
will be attended by other senior executives and also by the Chairman and 
the Chairman of the Remuneration Committee when topics such as 
strategy, remuneration and other operational matters will be discussed.
The Board also receives at each Board Meeting detailed reports on 
employee matters, at Group level and for each operating division.
More details are set out on pages 23, 48, 81 and 95.
Health and safety
The health and safety of our employees; customers; suppliers; 
subcontractors; and all visitors to our businesses and development sites; 
continues to be a non-negotiable top priority for the Company. The Board 
receives reports on health, safety and environmental matters, at Group 
level and for each operating division at each Board Meeting. The HSE 
Director attends each Group Operational Team meeting and also attends 
the Board on an annual basis to present on key HSE issues, initiatives, 
trends and statistics. More details are set out on pages 6, 14, 21 and 28 
to 29.
Engagement with our customers
Delivering high levels of customer satisfaction enhances the reputation of 
our business and reduces the costs associated with rectifying poor quality 
work. The Board and the Group Management Team regularly review 
customer satisfaction scores as independently reported and consider 
ways in which these can be improved. One such change during 2017 was 
the introduction of an online Customer Portal, guiding customers through 
the Customer Journey in purchasing their new home and providing a 
forum for two-way communication as the building and sales processes are 
progressed. The Board receives monthly reports on customer service 
matters, at Group level and for each operating division. Following the 
Company’s review into historic leasehold practices, during the year we 
also established the Taylor Wimpey Ground Rent Review Assistance 
Scheme in order to help our customers who have leases with ground rents 
that double every ten years to the fiftieth anniversary before being capped, 
to covert them to an RPI mechanism should they wish to participate in the 
Scheme. We have apologised to these customers and recognise that the 
implementation of these clauses fell short of the standards that we set for 
ourselves. More details are set out on pages 7 and 32 to 33.
Engagement with our supply chain
We negotiate with subcontractors and suppliers, both on a national and a 
local basis, to develop framework agreements and local commercial terms 
which reflect the payment practices and performance on which we are 
required to report in respect of the first half of 2018 by 31 July 2018. The 
report will be available online from that date. More details are set out on 
pages 21 and 28 to 29.
Engagement with local communities
We actively seek the views of local communities and develop a tailored 
planning and community engagement strategy for each development site, 
working closely with communities and other local stakeholders throughout 
all aspects of the planning process. We also support communities, both 
locally and nationally, through our charitable work, including financially and 
giving time, energy and leadership to support local efforts. More details are 
set out on pages 7, 15, 21, 27 and 96 to 97. Directors’ Report: Governance

The Board and its Committees
As at the date of this Report, the Board consists of ten Directors, namely: the 
Chairman, three Executive Directors and six Independent Non Executive 
Directors. Their names, responsibilities and other details appear on page 58.
The role of the Independent Non Executive Directors is to offer advice and 
guidance to the Executive Directors, using their wide experience in business 
and from their diverse backgrounds, details of which are set out in their 
biographies on pages 46 to 47 and 58 and in the Board diversity analysis on 
pages 46 to 47. They also provide a constructive challenge, monitoring the 
overall direction and strategy of the Company; scrutinising the performance 
of the Executive Directors; and satisfying themselves as to the integrity of the 
financial information made available both to the Board and to the 
Company’s shareholders. The Non Executive Directors also play an 
important part in the appointment or removal of Executive Directors and in 
general succession planning for the Board and other executive and senior 
management positions below Board level.
Board attendance
The Board met on eight occasions during 2017 and there was full 
attendance at all meetings by all Directors except, as noted on the table 
opposite, Mike Hussey missed one meeting due to being overseas on 
business. The Board regularly considers the number of Board meetings that 
take place each year and has concluded that eight meetings remain 
appropriate but will keep the number under review. Additional Board 
meetings would be convened as and when necessary and there are also 
processes in place for approving transactions and other matters that may 
require approval in between Board meetings.
Directors make every effort to attend all Board and applicable Committee 
meetings, as strongly evidenced by the exceptionally strong attendance 
records over many years. Where, exceptionally, a Director is unable to attend 
a meeting, it is Board policy that the Chairman and / or the Group Legal 
Director and Company Secretary (the ‘Secretary’) will, as soon as possible, 
brief the Director fully on the business transacted at the meeting and on any 
decisions that have been taken. In addition, the views of the Director are 
sought ahead of the meeting and conveyed to those attending by the 
Chairman and / or the Secretary as appropriate. Details of the attendance  
of each Director at Board and Committee meetings are set out in the table 
opposite and on pages 62, 67 and 74.
Board responsibilities
The Board discharges its responsibilities by providing strategic and 
entrepreneurial leadership of the Company, within a framework of strong 
governance, effective controls and a strong culture emphasising openness 
and transparency, which enables opportunities and risks to be assessed and 
managed appropriately. In addition, the Board sets the Company’s strategic 
aims; ensures that the necessary financial and human resources are in 
place for the Company to meet its objectives; and reviews 
management performance.
Company culture
A healthy culture is extremely important and the Board fully agrees with the 
FRC that it both “protects and generates value” and that it should be the 
subject of a continuous focus rather than wait for a crisis. The Board is 
responsible for the Company’s culture and for defining and setting the 
Company’s values and standards from the top. Culture is established by 
leadership and by example but this also needs to be underpinned by clear 
policies and codes of conduct which ensure that the Company’s obligations 
to its shareholders and other stakeholders are clearly understood and met, 
as described in more detail on page 51. The Board is led in these respects 
by the Chairman, who ensures the Board operates correctly, setting its 
culture and, by extension, that of the Company in its operations and its 
dealings with all stakeholders.
During the course of 2017 and into 2018, the Board actively reviewed and 
monitored several key areas that it considers are important indicators of 
the Company culture, including health, safety, and environmental matters 
(as set out on page 55), customer service, land and major projects, risk 
strategy, and diversity and inclusivity. The Board will keep all of these 
areas under regular review.

Taylor Wimpey plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Corporate Governance continued Appliance of the UK Corporate Governance Code
The UK Financial Reporting Council promotes high quality corporate governance and reporting through The UK Corporate Governance Code (the ‘Code’), with 
which all companies with a premium listing on the UK Stock Exchange are required to either comply in full, or explain why, and to what extent, they do not so 
comply. The Corporate Governance section of this Annual Report explains how the Code principles have been applied, as set out below:
Section A: Leadership
Every company should be headed by an effective board which is collectively 
responsible for the long term success of the company. See page 50.
There should be a clear division of responsibilities at the head of the 
company between the running of the board and the executive 
responsibility for the running of the company’s business. No one individual 
should have unfettered powers of decision. See page 58.
The chairman is responsible for leadership of the board and ensuring its 
effectiveness in all aspects of its role. See page 50.
As part of their role as members of a unitary board, non executive directors 
should constructively challenge and help develop proposals on strategy. 
See page 50.
Section B: Effectiveness
The board and its committees should have the appropriate balance of 
skills, experience, independence and knowledge of the company to enable 
them to discharge their respective duties and responsibilities effectively. 
See page 58.
There should be a formal, rigorous and transparent procedure for the 
appointment of new directors to the board. See pages 68 to 69.
All directors should be able to allocate sufficient time to the company to 
discharge their responsibilities effectively. See page 61.
All directors should receive induction on joining the board and should 
regularly update and refresh their skills and knowledge. See page 69.
The board should be supplied in a timely manner with information in a form 
and of a quality appropriate to enable it to discharge its duties. See page 69.
The board should undertake a formal and rigorous annual evaluation of 
its own performance and that of its committees and individual directors. 
See page 61.
All directors should be submitted for re-election at regular intervals, subject 
to continued satisfactory performance. See page 59
Section C: Accountability
The board should present a fair, balanced and understandable 
assessment of the company’s position and prospects. See page 66.
The board is responsible for determining the nature and extent of the 
principal risks it is willing to take in achieving its strategic objectives. The 
board should maintain sound risk management and internal control 
systems. See pages 36 to 41 and 64.
The board should establish formal and transparent arrangements for 
considering how they should apply the corporate reporting, risk 
management and internal control principles and for maintaining an 
appropriate relationship with the company’s auditors. See pages 64 and 65.
Section D: Remuneration
Executive directors’ remuneration should be designed to promote the 
long-term success of the company. Performance-related elements should 
be transparent, stretching and rigorously applied. See pages 74 to 92.
There should be a formal and transparent procedure for developing policy 
on executive remuneration and for fixing the remuneration packages of 
individual directors. No director should be involved in deciding his or her 
own remuneration. See pages 74-92.
Section E: Relations with shareholders
There should be a dialogue with shareholders based on the mutual 
understanding of objectives. The board as a whole has responsibility for 
ensuring that a satisfactory dialogue with shareholders takes place. See 
pages 51, 74 and 81.
The board should use general meetings to communicate with investors 
and to encourage their participation. See page 51.
Statement of compliance
For the year ended 31 December 2017, the Company complied with all the provisions of the Code; the Financial Conduct Authority’s (FCA) Disclosure and 
Transparency Rules sub-chapters 7.1 and 7.2 which set out certain mandatory disclosure requirements; the FCA’s Listing Rules 9.8.6R, 9.8.7R and 
9.8.7AR which include the ‘comply or explain’ requirement; and the BEIS Directors’ Remuneration Reporting Regulations and Narrative Reporting 
Regulations. These regulations are publicly available as follows:
 – The Code can be found at www.frc.org.uk
 – The FCA’s Disclosure and Transparency Rules as well as Listing Rules can be found at www.handbook.fca.org.uk
 – The BEIS Directors’ Remuneration Reporting Regulations and Narrative Reporting Regulations can be found at www.gov.uk

taylorwimpey.co.uk Directors’ Report: Governance
How we are governed
Board activities
This Report seeks to explain what your Board of Directors does and describes 
how it is responsible for setting the culture and values of the Company, 
ensuring that the Company is run in the best interests of its shareholders as 
well as other stakeholders, and how it interacts with its shareholders in 
explaining the Company’s strategic goals and performance against them. 
From a governance perspective, it is not just a case of what is done but also, 
and just as importantly, how it is done. In light of this, we therefore try and 
avoid a simple ‘box ticking’ type approach to corporate governance, 
preferring our own governance to be something that is properly embedded in 
our people, processes and decision making at all levels and vested in the 
personal values of all Directors and senior management.
As a Board we review health, safety and environmental performance at 
every Board meeting and also regularly review: our business strategy; key 
risks; the market; operational matters; customer service; diversity and 
inclusivity; corporate responsibility; our financial position and performance; 
governance, compliance and legal matters; and stakeholder-related matters 
including the make up of our share register and investor relations 
programme; community engagement; and human resources and wider 
employee matters. This is done through the consideration and discussion of 
regular reports submitted by the Executive Directors and through regular 
reports and presentations from our senior management and external 
advisers. The Board and individual Directors also undertake regular visits to 
our regional businesses and their development sites, which has proved to 
be both very useful and informative.

taylorwimpey.co.uk Directors’ Report: Governance
Division of responsibilities
The Board has an established framework of delegated financial, commercial 
and operational authorities, which define the scope and powers of the Chief 
Executive and of operational management.
In line with the Code, the roles and responsibilities of the Chairman and the 
Chief Executive have been clearly defined, set out in writing and signed by 
Kevin Beeston and Pete Redfern in their respective capacities. 
Health, safety and environment
As also set out in our 2017 Sustainability Report, which will shortly be available 
online at www.taylorwimpey.co.uk/corporate/sustainability, the Board is fully 
committed to providing a safe place in which our employees and 
subcontractors can work, and that our customers can live. We also ensure 
that all of our sites are developed to high standards of environmental 
management. As the first substantive item at each Board meeting, the Board 
receives detailed reports on health, safety and environmental matters in 
respect of the Company’s operations in the UK and Spain. The Company’s 
detailed carbon reporting, as required by BEIS, is set out on page 30.
Operational oversight
Operational management of the Company’s business is undertaken by the 
Chief Executive who receives advice from the Group Management Team 
(GMT). The GMT is the most senior executive committee and, in addition to 
the Chief Executive, consists of the Group Finance Director, the Group Legal 
Director and Company Secretary, the three Divisional Chairmen and the 
Group Operations Director, the Group HR Director, the Divisional Managing 
Director of Central and East London and the Managing Director of the Major 
Developments business. The GMT meets on a regular basis and also once 
each month with the Divisional Managing Directors when it sits in the capacity 
of the wider Group Operational Team.
The Board also receives regular reports and minutes from the Treasury 
Committee, which meets under the chairmanship of the Group Finance 
Director, and also comprises the Group Legal Director and Company 
Secretary, one of the Divisional Chairmen (who rotate periodically) and the 
Group Treasurer. The key responsibilities of the Treasury Committee are, 
broadly, to monitor and keep under review the Group’s financial risks, financial 
policies, financial facilities, covenant compliance and insurance programme in 
the light of current and proposed strategic and operational requirements, and 
Relevant skills and expertise
It is a requirement of the Code that the Board and its Committees should 
have the appropriate balance of skills, experience, independence and 
knowledge of the Company to enable duties and responsibilities to be 
discharged effectively. This was reviewed during the year and was utilised 
in drawing up the recruitment framework, including the list of desired skills, 
in the process used for the appointment of a new Independent Non 
Executive Director in February 2018. The Board considers that each 
Director brings relevant and complementary skills, experience and 
background to the Board, details of which are set out below, and 
additional information is also set out in the biographies on pages 46 to 47. 
The Board also considers that each Director is able to allocate sufficient 
time to the Company to discharge their responsibilities effectively and 
makes this an important requirement of recruitment.
Kevin Beeston, Chairman, has a wealth of commercial, financial and high 
level management experience including being a former CEO of a FTSE 
100 company. Kevin also has significant experience of chairing boards of 
both public and private companies and of being a non executive director 
and sitting on audit, nomination and remuneration committees.
Pete Redfern, Chief Executive, has operational responsibility for delivering 
the Company’s strategy in a profitable, safe and environmentally 
responsible manner. Pete has significant financial, operational and 
management experience, gained from his various roles in industry and 
from his time at KPMG. In 2014 he joined the Board of Travis Perkins plc 
as an independent non executive director and serves on their 
remuneration and Stay Safe committees.
Ryan Mangold, Group Finance Director, has operational responsibility for 
managing the Company’s finances and overseeing IT; commercial 
department and pensions matters. Ryan has financial, treasury, risk and 
financial control expertise including that gained from his time with Mondi 
Group and Anglo American plc.
James Jordan, Group Legal Director and Company Secretary, is a 
solicitor and oversees compliance with legal and regulatory obligations 
and manages the Secretariat and Legal Departments. James has 
significant legal, commercial, transactional and regulatory / governance 
related experience and expertise.
Kate Barker, Independent Non Executive Director, is an industry-
recognised economist and has led policy reviews for the Government in 
the areas of land use, planning and housing supply. Kate also brings a 
wider economic insight gained through her various roles, including as a 
Member of the Oversight Board of the Office for Budget Responsibility as 
well as experience from her other non executive positions.
Gwyn Burr, Independent Non Executive Director, has over 25 years’ 
executive experience, principally in customer service in the retail sector, 
which included the roles of Customer Director and Customer Service and 
Colleague Director from 2005 to 2013 at Sainsbury plc. Gwyn also has 
significant experience on several boards as a non executive director. 
Mike Hussey, Independent Non Executive Director, has in-depth expertise 
in land development and marketing, particularly in London, gained from his

and marketing of the Canary Wharf Group plc. Mike is currently CEO of

Angela Knight, Independent Non Executive Director, has significant 
high-level experience in both the public and private sectors. In the public

Taylor Wimpey plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Corporate Governance continued to make recommendations to the Board or GMT, as appropriate, regarding 
policy or operational changes in these areas.
All businesses and employees are expected to operate at all times to the 
highest standards of integrity and conduct in all matters concerning the 
Group. Accordingly, there is a Code of Business Conduct, which sets 
out the standard for individual dealings both internally and externally. Formal 
policies have been adopted, which set out the ethical framework within 
which all Taylor Wimpey companies and employees are required to 
undertake their business – this includes, in line with the Bribery Act 2010, 
an Anti-Corruption Policy which requires an annual sign-off by designated 
senior management. All business units receive training each year from 
external experts on legislative and regulatory matters.
The following documents relating to the Group’s management processes and 
division of responsibility are available for review on the Company’s website at 
www.taylorwimpey.co.uk/corporate/investor-relations/corporate-governance:
 – Schedule of matters specifically reserved for the decision of the Board, 
including full oversight of all decisions on profit expectations and 
Dividend Policy.
 – Terms of reference of the Board Committees: Audit, Nomination and 
Remuneration, which outline their objectives and responsibilities 
and define a programme of activities to support the discharge of 
those responsibilities.
 – Policies covering operational, compliance, corporate responsibility and 
stakeholder matters, including those related to the Bribery Act 2010 and 
Anti-Corruption referred to above, which are reviewed whenever 
necessary to take account of developments in corporate governance, 
changes in legislation and revised processes.
 – The Company’s Articles of Association.
Relevant reporting against these is provided to the Audit Committee by the 
Head of Internal Audit and the Secretary as appropriate.
Advice available to the Board
All Directors have access to the advice and services of the Secretary. 
The Board has an established procedure whereby Directors may take 
independent professional advice at the Company’s expense where they judge 
it necessary to do so in order to discharge their responsibilities as Directors.
The Board took advice during the year from Eversheds Sutherland LLP in 
developing processes and training modules designed to alert management to 
any instances of Modern Slavery.
Advice was also received from Deloitte during the year via the Audit 
Committee on the significant governance developments during the year.
The Board receives at each meeting a report from JPMorgan Cazenove 
(Cazenove) on the sector and the relative performance of the 
Company’s share price. 
Board and Committee balance, diversity, independence 
and effectiveness
A key role of the Board Chairman is to ensure that the Board is conducted so 
as to allow the Independent Non Executive Directors to challenge the 
Executive Directors constructively whilst, at the same time, also supporting 
them to implement the strategy and run the business effectively. Another key 
role is to ensure that it has the right blend of skill, independence and 
knowledge, and this is something that is kept under regular review in 
conjunction with the Nomination Committee.
It is the Company’s policy, in line with the Code, that proposed appointments 
to the Board, and succession planning, are based on merit, and judged 
against objective criteria, whilst also having due regard to the benefits of 
diversity and inclusiveness, including gender, age, disability, ethnicity, thought 
and experience. 
The Board also continues to recognise, welcome and take very seriously its 
responsibility to comply with the recommendations of the Davies Report as 
built on by the Hampton Alexander Review, encouraging increased 
participation by women on boards, which is now targeted at 33% for all FTSE 
350 companies by 2020; and which is also aimed at increasing the number of 
women in leadership positions of FTSE 100 companies to 33%, namely 
members of the Executive Committee and those senior leaders who are direct 
reports to Executive Committee members. The proportion of women on the 
Taylor Wimpey Board remained two out of nine (22%) throughout 2017. As at 
the date of this Annual Report, following the appointment of Gwyn Burr on 
1 February 2018, the proportion of women increased to 30% and will increase 
to 33% following the conclusion of the 2018 Annual General Meeting (AGM), 
when, as previously announced, Rob Rowley stands down from the Board. 
The Board will keep its balance and composition under regular review and 
when so doing will take into account the recommendations of the above 
Reports encouraging an increased proportion of women, referred to above, 
and also the Parker Review and its Report into the Ethnic Diversity of Boards.
The Board considers that there is an effective balance with three Executive 
Directors and six (shortly to become five, with effect from 26 April 2018) Non 
Executive Directors plus myself as Chairman, which ensures that each 
viewpoint is properly represented around the Board table. 
It also ensures that in line with the Code, there is an effective balance of 
guidance, support and constructive challenge to the Executive. The Board 
also considers that this will continue to be the case when Rob Rowley stands 
down from the Board after the AGM, as referred to above. 
The process followed in appointing a new director to the Board , which was 
used in connection with the appointment of Gwyn Burr on 1 February 2018, 
encompassing a comprehensive search, assessment and recruitment 
process led by the Nomination Committee, is set out on page 68 to 69.
The Nomination Committee makes recommendations on appointments and 
succession planning to the Board, and more details can be found in the 
Nomination Committee Report on pages 67 to 73.
In accordance with the Code, all Directors will again be subject to election or 
re-election as appropriate by shareholders at the AGM of the Company which 
is being held on 26 April 2018 (other than Rob Rowley). Biographical details of 
each Director can be found on pages 46 to 47 and also on page 58.
Annual re-election to the Board
The Code requires every Director to seek election or re-election, as 
appropriate, at each year’s AGM. Accordingly, at the 2018 AGM, every 
Director, irrespective of the date of his or her appointment and the length of 
his or her service on the Board, will be submitted for re-election (other than 
Rob Rowley).
Details of the resolutions to be proposed in this respect and supporting 
biographical details of the Directors appear in the Notice of Meeting on 
pages 151 to 157.
As part of the 2017 Board evaluation process, the Board reviewed and 
re-affirmed that it considers each of the Non Executive Directors to be 
independent in character and judgement and that there are no relationships 
which could affect the Director’s judgement. For Gwyn Burr, who was 
appointed on 1 February 2018, this evaluation took place as part of the 
appointment process. In line with the Code, a rigorous evaluation took place 
with regard to each of Kate Barker, Mike Hussey and Rob Rowley as they 
will each have served seven, six and eight years respectively by the time of 
the AGM in April 2018. Rob Rowley will, as announced on 10 January 2018, 
stand down from the Board at the conclusion of the Company’s 2018 AGM 
on 26 April 2018.
In addition, the Board re-evaluated each Director’s time commitments, 
and was satisfied that, in line with the Code, they each continued to allocate 
sufficient time to the Company in order to discharge their responsibilities 
effectively, including not only attendance at Board and applicable Committee 
meetings but also preparation time for meetings, visits to businesses (including 
 59
taylorwimpey.co.uk Directors’ Report: Governance
the annual Board away day / visit) and other additional requirements that may 
be required from time to time. For Gwyn Burr, who was appointed with effect 
from 1 February 2018, this evaluation took place as part of the appointment 
process. It has previously been announced that Gwyn Burr will stand down as 
an independent non executive director of DFS plc during the Spring of 2018. 
Recognising the importance of the time commitment of each Director to 
shareholders, this will continue to be kept under review for all Directors during 
2018, including as part of the annual Board evaluation process.
The Chairman, at the time of his appointment on 1 July 2010, met the 
independence criteria as set out in the Code.
Management
Progress in achieving the Group Strategy is reviewed at each Board meeting 
and is reported on page 13. The Chief Executive has responsibility for 
preparing and reviewing strategic plans for the Group and the annual 
budgetary process. These are subject to formal review and approval by 
the Board.
Budgets are re-examined in comparison with business forecasts throughout 
the year to ensure they are sufficiently robust in order to reflect the possible 
impact of changing economic conditions and circumstances. The Chief 
Executive and the Board conduct regular reviews of actual results and future 
projections with comparison against budget and prior year, together with 
various treasury reports. Disputes that may give rise to significant litigation or 
contractual claims are monitored at each Board meeting, with specific 
updates on any material developments or new matters presented by 
the Secretary.
The Group has clearly defined policies, processes and procedures governing 
all areas of the business, which will continue to be reviewed and refined in 
order to meet the requirements of the business and changing market 
circumstances. Defined authority limits continue to be closely monitored in 
response to prevailing market conditions. Any investment, acquisition or 
significant purchase or disposal of land requires detailed appraisal and is 
subject to approval by the Board or the Chief Executive, depending on the 
value and nature of the investment or contract.
There is a clearly identifiable organisational structure and a framework 
of delegated authority approved by the Board within which individual 
responsibilities of senior executives of Group companies are identified and can 
be monitored. The Operating Framework, within which delegated authorities, 
responsibilities and related processes are explained in detail, is available for 
review and guidance online by any employee through the Company’s intranet. 
These activities are reinforced through process compliance and other audits 
conducted by Internal Audit.
The annual employee performance appraisal process is competency-based, 
with individual objectives cascaded down from the appropriate business 
objectives. The process also identifies training needs to support achievement 
of objectives.
During 2017 the Group’s control environment was further enhanced through 
a robust risk assessment and review led by the Audit Committee, which 
identified the key risks to be reviewed and assessed by Internal Audit as part 
of its programme of work during the year.
Ensuring there is no conflict of interest
In order to assist Directors in complying with their duty to avoid conflicts (or 
possible conflicts) of interest, it is standard procedure that the Board must first 
give its clearance to such potential conflicts of interest (which would include 
directorships or other interests in outside companies and organisations) 
following which, an entry is then made in the statutory register which the 
Company maintains for this purpose.
Whenever any Director considers that he or she is, or may be, interested in 
any contract or arrangement to which the Company is or may be a party, the 
Director gives due notice to the Board in accordance with the Companies Act 
2006 and the Company’s Articles of Association. In such cases, unless 
allowed by the Articles, any Director with such an interest is not permitted to 
participate in any discussions or decisions relating to the contract 
or arrangement.
The Board undertakes a regular review of each Director’s interests, if any, 
outside the Company. In addition, all new appointments and interests of 
Directors are reported to the Board for consideration or noting as appropriate. 
Following these reviews, the Board remains satisfied that, in line with the 
Code, all Directors are able to allocate sufficient time to the Company to 
enable them to discharge their responsibilities as Directors effectively and that 
any current external appointments do not detract from the extent or quality of 
time which the Director is able to devote to the Company. This is further borne 
out by Directors’ attendance at Board and Committee meetings, which has 
been at or very close to 100% over many years.
Anti-bribery and anti-corruption 
In line with the Bribery Act 2010, the Company has written policies on 
avoiding and not tolerating bribery or corruption. The policies apply across all 
of the Company’s businesses and are available for review externally on the 
Company’s website and by all employees on the Company’s extranet. The 
risk to the Company of non-compliance would be reputational damage, 
financial penalties and the possible exclusion from certain approved partner 
arrangements. These risks are mitigated by training for senior managers and 
by issuing an annual reminder to all businesses and key departments requiring 
each managing director or departmental head to check that their teams have 
complied with the policies during the reporting year; remain aware of the 
policies’ requirements for the coming year; and to formally confirm in writing 
that they have done so.
This 2017 Annual Report and Accounts
Your Directors have responsibility for preparing this 2017 Annual Report and 
Accounts and for making certain confirmations concerning it. In accordance 
with the Code provision C.1.1 the Board considers that, taken as a whole, it is 
fair, balanced and understandable and provides the information necessary for 
shareholders to assess the Company’s position, performance, business 
model and strategy.
The Board was able to reach this conclusion after receiving advice from the 
Audit Committee. The processes of review and assessment followed by that 
Committee in that respect are set out on page 66.
The Viability Statement, as required by the Code, appears on page 41.

Taylor Wimpey plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Corporate Governance continued A key requirement of good governance is 
ensuring that the Board itself is operating 
effectively. The carrying out of an annual 
evaluation is a very important exercise and it is 
one which the Board takes very seriously, whilst 
also recognising the focus that our shareholders 
place on it. In line with the Code, the Board 
conducts its annual evaluation exercise via an 
independent external facilitator once every three 
years. Accordingly the evaluation for 2017 was 
externally facilitated by Manchester Square 
Partners (‘MSP’), which was chosen for its track 
record in performing rigorous evaluations for a 
number of FTSE100 companies and who have 
no other connection to the Company.
The exercise considered the effectiveness of the 
Board, each Board Committee and each 
Director, and also focused on the Board’s 
approach to key governance issues:
 – Strategy
 – Challenges and risks
 – Values and culture
 – Role
 – Dynamics
 – Engagement
 – Structure
 – Composition
 – Succession
The 2017 evaluation process was conducted 
between August and November 2017 and 
consisted of the following:
 – Briefing and planning meetings between the 
Chairman, Secretary and MSP.
 – A detailed and comprehensive bespoke 
questionnaire which MSP sent individually to 
all Directors for completion and return to them.
 – An interview with each of the Directors.
 – Meetings with key internal reports 
immediately below Board level who have 
experience of attending the Company’s 
Board meetings and external advisers such 
as the Audit partner and Broker.
 – Attendance at a meeting of each of the 
Board and the Nomination and 
Remuneration Committees, to experience 
the Board and its committees in action.
 – Presentation of the key findings and 
recommendations by MSP to the Board on 
a non-attributable basis.
The overall outcome of the evaluation exercise 
was that MSP considered that the Board was 
functioning well and in line with first class 
corporate governance principles, and is 
providing effective leadership to the Group.
As part of the Board evaluation, the time 
commitments of all Directors in line with the 
requirements of the Code were reviewed in 
detail. Following this review, the Board was 
satisfied that each Director was able to allocate 
sufficient time to discharge his or her 
responsibilities to the Company effectively. This 
included not only attendance at Board and 
applicable Committee meetings (where 
attendance was 100% during 2017 for all 
Directors, save for Mike Hussey missing one 
meeting of the Board and of the Audit 
Committee as noted on page 52), but also 
preparation time for meetings, visits to our 
businesses and other additional requirements 
that may be required from time to time.
On the one occasion when Mike Hussey missed 
a meeting of the Board and of the Audit 
Committee, he was comprehensively briefed by 
the Secretary following the meeting on the main 
matters arising.
Consistent with previous exercises, the 2017 
evaluation proved to be very useful. It was 
pleasing to note that MSP concluded that the 
Board continues to function very well. However, 
it also provided an opportunity to reflect on how 
we operate and where we can improve. I can 
confirm that the Board has already focused on 
the areas identified for improvement and will 
continue to do so during the course of 2018.
Details of this year’s evaluation; its outcome; the 
actions planned by the Board during 2018 to 
address the issues raised; and the actions taken 
during 2017 to address the issues raised in the 
last (internally facilitated) evaluation conducted in 
2016 and reported in last year’s Annual Report, 
are set out in the table below.
The outcome of the 2016 Board evaluation 
(which was internally facilitated, in line with the 
requirement of the Code that the exercise be 
externally facilitated every three years) was 
reported on in detail in last year’s Corporate 
Governance Report. The main action points 
arising from that exercise, and action taken in 
respect of each, are set out in the table below.
Board evaluation
2017 Evaluation – Recommendations included Actions being or to be taken during 2018
Devote additional Board time to strategy. Although significant time is already devoted to strategic matters this 
recommendation is already being addressed with additional time 
earmarked for discussion.
Devote additional time to risk including non-operational risk, and those which 
are considered to be strategic and lower probability in nature.
Work commenced on this during 2017 and is planned to be developed 
further during 2018.
Undertake additional focus on succession planning taking into account 
forthcoming NED changes based on length of service.
This will be a topic for Nomination Committee consideration during 2018.
Each of these key areas remains firmly on the Board’s agenda during 2018 
and an update will be provided in the 2018 Annual Report and Accounts.
2016 Evaluation – Recommendations included Actions taken during the year
Additional reporting to take place on key areas such as financial analysis, 
competitor comparisons, IT, and macro economic and market issues.
Additional reporting to the Board on these areas of the business took 
place at Board meetings during 2017 and will continue, going forward.
There needs to be continued focus on cyber risk and further improving the 
Company’s defences against the risk.
This has been the subject of detailed reviews by the Board and the Audit 
Committee during 2017 and will continue, going forward.
Additional focus to take place on diversity and inclusivity including continued 
monitoring and review.
This remained a key topic for the Board and the Nomination Committee 
during 2017 and remains so during 2018. The Board’s Diversity Policy and 
details of progress achieved, and plans for further progress during 2018, are 
set out in the Nomination Committee Report on pages 71 to 73.
Each of these key areas remains firmly on the Board’s agenda during 2018 
and an update will be provided in the 2018 Annual Report and Accounts.

Dear Shareholder
I am pleased to be able to take my first opportunity since apointment as 
Chairman of the Audit Committee to summarise below, and in the report which 
follows, the ongoing responsibilities and objectives of the Committee; the work 
that has been carried out during 2017; and the priorities established for 2018.
The Committee supports the Board in fulfilling its corporate governance 
responsibilities, including the Group’s risk management and internal control 
framework; internal audit process; financial reporting practices; the preparation 
and compliance of the Company’s Annual Report and Accounts; external 
audit process; and whistleblowing procedures.
The terms of reference of the Audit Committee are summarised opposite 
and are available in full on the Company’s website. Following a review during 
2017 it was determined that they remain appropriate and reflect the 
Committee’s responsibilities under the UK Corporate Governance Code (the 
Code) and related regulations, including the guidance note issued in March 
2017 by the Institute of Chartered Secretaries and Administrators on terms 
of reference for Audit Committees.
The Committee conducts an annual evaluation of its performance against its 
key objectives. The evaluation for 2017 was recently formally assessed by the 
Committee at its February 2018 meeting.
The key performance areas of the Committee during 2017 are set out 
opposite and described in more detail in this report.
The Committee’s key areas of focus for 2018 are also set out opposite, with 
the continuation of robust risk management and work to further reduce risk in 
areas, such as cyber security, remaining key priorities for the year ahead.
The Committee holds meetings with the external auditor and the Head of 
Internal Audit, independent of the Executive, and these assist in ensuring that 
reporting, forecasting and risk management processes are subject to rigorous 
review throughout the year.
I am pleased to confirm that throughout the year the Committee met the 
Financial Reporting Council (‘FRC’) guidance on Audit Committees which was 
issued in April 2016, and which was incorporated into the Code. The aim of 
the guidance was to further improve good governance around the 
Committee’s competence; induction for new members; audit rotation; 
independent assessment of areas of judgement; and sufficiency of resourcing 
for the Committee; all with the aim of ensuring that it was able to perform its 
primary function of protecting shareholders’ interests in relation to the 
Company’s financial reporting and internal control.
The Committee will continue to focus on ensuring that all relevant codes and 
regulations are complied with to ensure that the business is operating in a 
controlled and managed environment.
I should like to thank Rob, who stands down from the Board at the conclusion 
of the Company’s 2018 AGM, on behalf of the Committee and the 
shareholders, for his work as Chairman of the Committee since 2010, and to 
wish him well for the future.

Committee purpose and responsibilities
The membership of the Audit Committee is set out in the table opposite. Committee meetings are also attended, by invitation, by the Executive Directors, Head 
of Internal Audit, other senior executives and by Deloitte LLP (Deloitte), the external auditor. The Committee also meets privately with representatives from 
Deloitte during at least two Committee meetings per annum, which normally take place around the time of the Full and Half Year financial statements, in order to 
discuss any matters which the auditor may wish to raise in confidence, with only the Secretary being present.
Committee activities during 2017
The Audit Committee met on three occasions during the year. The reports considered at the February 2018 meeting concluded the Committee’s activities with 
regard to the Company’s 2017 reporting and have been included on page 66. 
At those meetings, the Committee carried out its remit which primarily included the following: 
Jul 2017 Feb 2018 Feb 2017 Dec 2017
 63
taylorwimpey.co.uk Directors’ Report: Governance
In addition, at each meeting, the Committee also reviewed its other areas of 
responsibility, including:
 – Financial reporting practices.
 – The risk management and internal control framework.
 – The internal audit process and the review of reports received and actions 
arising therefrom.
 – Checking for any incidences of fraud, actual, alleged or precautionary, 
and ensuring proper controls and a response plan are in place.
 – The adequacy of the Company’s whistleblowing procedures and the 
status of any investigations.
In carrying out these activities, the Committee places reliance on regular reports 
from Executive Management, Internal Audit and from Deloitte. In monitoring the 
financial reporting practices, the Committee reviewed accounting policies, areas 
of judgement highlighted by Executive Management and by the external auditor, 
the going concern assumptions and compliance with accounting standards and 
the requirements of the Code.
Committee competence
A key requirement of the FRC’s guidance on Audit Committees is that each 
Committee member should have sufficient knowledge; training; and expertise; 
to contribute effectively to the Committee’s deliberations.
As Committee Chairman, I have extensive experience in my role of Group 
Finance Director of Dixons Carphone plc of the financial reporting 
requirements of FTSE 100 companies; of financial reporting preparation and 
compliance for public companies; of dealing with internal and external 
auditors; and I also have experience of both attending Audit Committees and 
of being a member of an Audit Committee. This experience has given me an 
insight into key areas of shareholder concern and independent experience of 
robustly challenging both the executive and the external and internal auditor.
I am assisted by four other Independent Non Executive Directors:
Rob Rowley is the Committee’s former Chairman, who I succeeded as 
Chairman of the Committee on 10 January 2018 and who also has recent 
and relevant financial experience through currently chairing the Audit 
Committees at Greene King plc and Camelot Group. It has been announced 
that Rob will stand down from the Board at the conclusion of the Company’s 
2018 AGM. Kate Barker has wide experience of key areas in which the 
Company operates day to day, having led Government policy reviews into 
housing supply and land use planning. She also has experience of being a 
non executive director with Man Group plc and previously with Yorkshire 
Building Society. Mike Hussey has in-depth experience in land development 
and marketing, and also has experience at senior level as an executive board 
director of Land Securities plc and with Canary Wharf Group plc. Angela 
Knight has wide experience of financial services and banking and has 
extensive non executive director experience.
Between us, I am confident that the members of the Audit Committee have 
the necessary competence relevant for the house building sector as 
envisioned by the Code and that this will continue to be the case after Rob 
Rowley stands down.
As described in the Nomination Committee Report on page 69, there is a formal 
process of induction for new Directors and this includes specific reference to 
assisting competence in relevant Committee areas through exposure to 
appropriate areas of the Company’s operations and performance.
All the members of the Audit Committee are Independent Non Executive 
Directors and both myself, as Chairman and Rob Rowley have recent and 
relevant financial experience as required by the Code.
I am confident that the composition; balance; and expertise of the Audit 
Committee can give shareholders confidence that the financial; reporting; risk; 
and control processes of the Company are subjected to the appropriate level 
of independent, robust and challenging oversight.
Risk management and internal control
The Group has established an ongoing process of risk management and 
internal control, applying Main Principle C.2 and its Supporting Provisions of 
the Code which relates to determining the nature and extent of principal risks 
and the maintenance of sound risk management and internal control systems. 
The Board is responsible for the effectiveness of the system of internal control, 
which has been designed to meet the requirements of the Group and the 
risks it encounters, including taking account of environmental, social and 
governance considerations. The systems cannot eliminate the risk of failure 
but rather seek to manage both the likelihood of their occurrence and the 
extent of their impact, and can only provide reasonable and not absolute 
assurance against material misstatement or loss.
The Principal Risks facing the Company, as assessed by the Board, are set 
out on pages 36 to 41, together with information on the action taken and / or 
planned to mitigate each one, and a description on page 37 of the Group’s 
appetite for risk.
The Board makes its assessment of risk half yearly, after overseeing a 
bottom-up and top-down review of risk in all areas of the business. Action to 
mitigate the effect of each one is led by the Chief Executive either directly or 
indirectly in conjunction with the Group Management Team (GMT).
The Board’s assessments use a standard methodology which takes into 
account environmental, social and governance considerations. In 
compliance with the Code, the Board also regularly reviews the 
effectiveness of the Group’s system of internal control in providing a 
responsible assessment and mitigation of risks. 
The Board’s monitoring covers all controls, including financial, operational, 
compliance and assurance controls which include risk management. 
Compliance with the Group’s system of internal control is primarily driven and 
co-ordinated through compliance with an established Operating Framework 
supported by detailed manuals covering the main disciplines. These include 
clear levels of delegated authority, responsibility and accountability, and are 
subject to periodic review to ensure they remain appropriate and 
proportionate to the Group’s changing strategic and operating requirements. 
Adherence to the Operating Framework is monitored by management and 
assessed independently by Internal Audit. At its half year and year end 
meetings, the Board reviews risk in relation to the Company’s strategic 
objectives and its current plans to deliver them. It also reviews progress and 
performance in action taken to mitigate the impact of those risks.
The Board is supported in this by more regular and detailed reviews, by the 
Audit Committee, including the review of progress reports from Internal Audit, 
and by risk reviews across the business, led by the GMT. These reviews 
during 2017 resulted in a number of enhancements to internal controls, 
designed to reduce or better manage risk across the business. 
These included:
 – A seamless interface between the Enterprise Resources Planning (ERP) 
and the consolidation system and collection of non-financial data 
automatically, together with an improved audit trail of submissions.
 – Enhanced self-certification of business unit compliance with key controls 
across all functional areas.
 – Further standardisation of the approach to monitoring and control of 
large-scale infrastructure projects.
The Committee oversees the actions being taken to monitor Information 
Technology (IT) initiatives which aim to either directly protect against and reduce 
the risk of cyber-related type attacks and fraud; support and enhance the 
current IT environment including data protection; or that are crucial in their 
contribution to key business initiatives aiming to enhance the experience of 
customers, suppliers and employees.
At its meeting in February 2018, the Board, after conducting its own review 
and after reviewing more detailed assessments from the Audit Committee, 
remained satisfied that the system of internal control continued to be effective 
in identifying, assessing, and ranking the various risks facing the Company; 
and in monitoring and reporting progress in mitigating their potential impact on 
the Company. The Board also approved the statement of the Principal Risks 
and Uncertainties set out on pages 36 to 41 of this Annual Report.
Audit Committee Report continued

Taylor Wimpey plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Viability statement
The Committee reviewed the viability statement set out on page 41 together 
with the methodology underpinning it; the period it covered; and the 
robustness of the stress-testing undertaken. The outcome of that review was 
that it recommended its approval to the Board
External auditor
Re-appointment
As noted earlier, Deloitte LLP is the Company’s external auditor. Their 
performance is kept under regular review by the Board and the Audit 
Committee and the Committee undertakes a formal assessment of the 
external audit process each year including both current and ongoing suitability.
This review takes the form of a detailed checklist and questionnaire issued to 
Directors; executives involved in the detailed stages of the audit process; and 
a representative sample of employees in regional business units which were 
subject to audit. The responses were augmented by external feedback on the 
relative performance of auditors generally, and from regulatory sources.
The outcome of this review was that the Committee recommended to the 
Board, which in turn is recommending to shareholders in Resolution 13 at 
the 2018 AGM on page 151, that Deloitte LLP should continue as auditor to 
the Company.
Tender
The Company last conducted a tender process for the external audit in 
2007/2008. UK rules relating to the requirement for rotation of external 
auditors by FTSE 350 companies permit transitional arrangements in line with 
guidance issued by the FRC which, applied to the Company, allow the 
present auditor, Deloitte, to continue in office up to and including the 
conclusion of the audit of the Company’s 2020 accounts. This is considered 
by the Committee to be in the interests of shareholders and other 
stakeholders and it permits the present audit partner, Edward Hanson, to 
conclude his five year audit partner rotation and allows sufficient time 
thereafter for the Committee to prepare for the external audit to be the subject 
of a competitive tender of alternative firms to Deloitte, during 2020. The 
Company will of course keep the matter under regular review, taking into 
account the annual performance review to be conducted by the Committee 
as well as other relevant factors. There are no contractual restrictions on the 
Company’s selection of its external auditor.
Statement of compliance
The Company has complied throughout the reporting year with the provisions 
of The Statutory Audit Services for Large Companies Market Investigation 
(Mandatory Use of Competitive Tender Processes and Audit Committee 
Responsibilities) Order 2014.
Appointment of the auditor for non-audit services
The Audit Committee has a formal policy, reviewed annually, on whether the 
Company’s external auditor should be employed to provide services other 
than audit services. In line with the Code, the Committee has regard to the 
relevant ethical guidance regarding the provision of non-audit 
services by Deloitte.
As part of that policy, the Committee has determined that the following 
assignments should not be undertaken by the auditors:
 – Bookkeeping or other services related to the accounting records or 
financial statements.
 – Internal audit outsourcing services.
 – The provision of advice on large Information Technology systems.
 – Services connected with valuation, litigation support, legal, recruitment 
or remuneration.
Where non-audit services have an initial or forecast face value in excess of 
£100,000 there must be prior review and authorisation by the Group Finance 
Director and the Committee.
The Committee has reviewed this policy in light of the new regulation set out in 
the EU Audit Directive and Audit Regulation 2014 which applied to the 
Company from 1 October 2017.
The Regulations substantially curtail those non-audit services which can be 
provided by the auditor to the Group and in particular prohibits all tax-related 
services, including compliance services as well as general advice, and all 
consultancy and advisory services. The Regulations also require that Board 
approval is required if eligible non-audit services, such as due diligence and 
similar assurance services exceed 30% of the prior year Group audit fee. In 
addition, fees for eligible non-audit services are not to exceed 70% of the 
Group audit fee, calculated on a rolling three-year basis. The Board is satisfied 
that, following the above-mentioned review and taking into account the new 
regulation, this policy will be conducive to the maintenance of good 
governance, best practice and auditor independence and objectivity.
Non-audit services in 2017 predominantly related to work undertaken as a 
result of Deloitte’s role as auditors, in particular the assurance work carried out 
in connection with the announcement of the Company’s half year results for 
2017, which is of direct benefit to shareholders although it is not formally 
regarded as ‘audit’ work for reporting purposes. Deloitte also performed 
certain real estate work, for which they were selected as they were considered 
to be the best supplier for that service. All independence considerations were 
considered with regard to these services, in line with the above policy, and 
were fully compliant with it. 
The Audit Committee fully recognises and supports the importance of the 
independence of auditors. Its review of the auditor’s performance during 2017 
included non-audit services. The Committee is satisfied that the carrying out of 
the above work did not, and will not going forward, impair the independence 
of the external auditor. It also recognises that, from time to time, there is a 
clear commercial advantage based on cost and timetable requirements in 
using the Company’s auditors. As a result, the value of non-audit services 
work was £0.1m in 2017 (2016: £0.1m) which represents just under 25% of 
the audit fee as set out in Note 6 to the Accounts on page 116.
Internal Audit
The Internal Audit function reviews the effectiveness and efficiency of the 
systems of internal control in place to safeguard the assets; to quantify, price, 
transfer, avoid or mitigate risks; and to monitor the activities of the Group in 
accomplishing established objectives. The annual Internal Audit plan, and the 
individual audits conducted in line with the audit plan, are driven primarily by 
the principal risks faced by the business. Following each review an Internal 
Audit report is provided to both the management responsible for the area 
reviewed and the GMT. These reports outline Internal Audit’s opinion of the 
management control framework in place together with actions indicating 
improvements proposed or made as appropriate. The Chief Executive, the 
GMT and senior management consider the reports on a regular basis and are 
responsible for ensuring that improvements are made as agreed. A database 
of audit recommendations and improvement initiatives is maintained. 
Follow-up and escalation processes ensure that such improvements are 
implemented and fully embedded in a timely manner.
The Company belongs to and participates in industry-wide forums and other 
initiatives aimed at combating fraud within the construction industry.
Summaries of all key Internal Audit reviews and activity and resulting reports 
are provided to the Audit Committee for review and discussion.
The Internal Audit function also formally reviews proposed related-party 
transactions, such as purchases by employees from Group companies, to 
ensure proper procedures are followed and that such procedures are 
undertaken strictly in accordance with the formal policy in place and, where 
applicable, company law.
The most recent independent formal evaluation of the Internal Audit function 
was carried out in 2015 on behalf of the Audit Committee by PwC and its 
finding was that Internal Audit continues to operate effectively. A number of 
initiatives were progressed subsequently to ensure the Internal Audit function 
continues to meet both current best practice and the evolving needs of the 
Group. The next such evaluation will be carried out during 2019.
The Internal Audit Charter, which codifies the aims, processes and outputs of 
Internal Audit, was reviewed by the Committee for ongoing appropriateness.
The Internal Audit function and its reporting lines enable it to be independent 
of the executive and to exercise independent judgement.
The Head of Internal Audit has direct access at all times to the Chairman of 
the Audit Committee, the Chairman of the Board and also to the Chief 
Executive and the other Executive Directors.

taylorwimpey.co.uk Directors’ Report: Governance
Whistleblowing
The Group’s whistleblowing policy is supported by a clear process that 
includes an externally-facilitated hotline through which any person, including 
employees of the Company, may, in confidence, raise concerns about 
possible improprieties in financial reporting, other operational matters or 
inappropriate behaviours in the work place. All whistleblowing cases are 
formally investigated by the Head of Internal Audit, Group Director of Health, 
Safety and Environment (where appropriate), Group Human Resources 
Director and / or the Group Legal Director and Company Secretary depending 
on the nature of the issue. The Chief Executive is apprised of all allegations 
and conclusions of the review.
Whistleblowing incidents and their outcome are reported to the Audit 
Committee. Whistleblowing is a standing item on each Audit Committee 
agenda, which allows the Committee to regularly review the adequacy of the 
policy in line with its requirement to do so under the Code. The policy itself is 
periodically reviewed and includes the ability for workers to make protected 
disclosures with regard to matters arising under the Modern Slavery Act 2015 
with regard to our business and its supply chain. The Committee is satisfied 
that the policy and its administration remain effective.
Going concern
The Group has prepared forecasts, including certain sensitivities, taking into 
account the Principal Risks and Uncertainties identified on pages 36 to 41. 
Having considered these forecasts, the Directors remain of the view that the 
Group’s financing arrangements and capital structure provide both the 
necessary facilities and covenant headroom to enable the Group to conduct 
its business for at least the next 12 months. The Committee reviewed the 
forecasts and the Directors’ expectations based thereon, and agreed that 
they were reasonable. Accordingly, the consolidated financial statements have 
been prepared on a going concern basis.
Viability Statement
The viability statement is designed to be a longer term view of the sustainability 
of the Company’s strategy and business model and related resourcing, in the 
light of projected wider economic and market developments. The Committee 
reviewed the Directors’ expectations; the criteria upon which they were based; 
and the sensitivities applied; and agreed that they were reasonable. The 
statement appears on page 41 together with details of the processes, 
assumptions, and testing which underpin it.
Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Code provision C.1
The Board has responsibility, under Provision C.1 of the Code and its 
Supporting Principles and Code Provisions, for preparing the Company’s 
Annual Report and Accounts; for ensuring that it presents a fair, balanced and 
understandable assessment of the Company’s position and prospects; and 
that it provides the information necessary for shareholders to assess the 
Company’s performance, business model and strategy.
Process
The review of the Company’s Annual Report and Accounts took the form of a 
detailed assessment of the collaborative process of drafting them, which 
involves the Company’s Investor Relations; Company Secretariat; and Finance 
Departments, with guidance and input from other relevant Departments and 
external advisers. It ensured that there is a clear and unified link between this 
Annual Report and Accounts and the Company’s other external reporting, 
and between the three main sections of the Annual Report and Accounts 
– the Strategic Report; the Governance Reports; and the 
Financial Statements.
In particular, the Committee:
 – Reviewed all material matters, as reported elsewhere in this 
Annual Report.
 – Ensured that it correctly reflected the Company’s performance in the 
reporting year, as described in this Annual Report.
 – Ensured that it presented a consistent message throughout.
 – Ensured that it correctly reflected the Company’s business model, as 
described on page 21.
 – Ensured that it correctly described the Company’s strategy, as described 
on pages 13 and 20.
 – Considered whether it presented the information in a clear and concise 
manner, illustrated by appropriate KPIs, to facilitate shareholders’ access 
to relevant information.
Significant items
The items below are those that the Audit Committee have considered in 
discharging their duties and in considering the financial reporting of the Group.
Cost allocation of inventory
The cost allocation framework used across the Group determines the profit 
forecasted for each site and dictates the way in which inventory is costed and 
allocated across each development. It also ensures that any costs incurred in 
excess of the original forecast are recognised appropriately as the site progresses. 
The Committee reviewed the work undertaken by Deloitte LLP as part of the 
year-end audit which included testing of the Group-wide controls to monitor 
cost allocation and substantive testing. This enabled the Committee to gain 
assurance that the framework is used consistently and that areas of significant 
judgement including future sales prices, build costs and the allocation of 
shared infrastructure costs are being accurately represented in site forecasts.
Exceptional provision in relation to leasehold
At the July meeting, the Committee reviewed the assumptions used and the 
calculation of the £130.0 million exceptional provision. An update was provided 
to the Committee at the December meeting as some assumptions from the half 
year had crystalised as the Group had signed agreements with freeholders 
representing approximately 90% of identified leases. This review, combined with 
reviewing the report provided by Deloitte LLP enabled the Committee to 
conclude that the £130.0 million provision originally recognised remains the 
most appropriate estimate. 
Defined Benefit Pension valuations
During the year a Medically Underwritten Mortality Study (MUMS) was 
undertaken as part of the 2016 pension triennial valuation. The results of this, 
along with the market based assumptions (discount and inflation rates) used 
in calculating the net pension liabilities were discussed and agreed by the 
Committee to establish the net pension deficit recognised on the balance 
sheet at 31 December 2017.
Viability statement and going concern
Although the viability statement and going concern are matters for the whole 
Board, a review is made by the Committee of the appropriateness of the five-year 
assessment period, the Group’s headroom under its covenants and undrawn 
facilities in relation to the Group’s financial forecasts and sensitivity analysis.
Alternative Performance Measures (APMs)
The Committee reviewed the Group’s use of APMs and concurred with the 
presentation and balance between APMs and statutory measures throughout 
the annual report. They concluded that the APMs presented are appropriate 
and meet the criteria set out in the ESMA guidance. They were able to 
conclude this as they are widely used industry measures, form the basis of the 
key strategic targets and are linked directly to executive remuneration. 
Critical accounting judgements and key sources of 
estimation uncertainty
The Committee has considered the matters of key judgement and key 
sources of estimation uncertainty used in preparing the financial statements 
and they concur with the disclosure made in Note 2 on pages 111 to 112.
Recommendation to the Board
A summary of the process and of the Committee’s findings was considered 
by the Board at its meeting on 26 February 2018. The outcome of that 
review was that the Committee confirmed to the Board that the 2017 
Annual Report and Accounts met the requirements of Code provision C.1, 
and the Board’s formal statement to that effect, to meet the requirements of 
the Code, is set out on page 60.

Nomination Committee
The Committee is chaired by the Chairman of the Board and is 
composed of a majority of Independent Non Executive Directors as 
required by the Code. Its members are set out in the table below.
Dear Shareholder
I am pleased to be able to take this opportunity as Chairman of the 
Nomination Committee to summarise the important ongoing objectives and 
responsibilities of the Committee; the work that has been carried out during 
2017; and its plans for the coming year.
The Nomination Committee performs an extremely important role and this can 
be demonstrated by the fact that in addition to myself, all of the Non Executive 
Directors are also members of this Committee.
The primary objectives of the Committee are to support the Board in fulfilling 
its responsibilities to ensure that there are firstly, formal, rigorous 
and transparent processes in place for the appointment of new Directors both 
to the Board and to senior management positions, and secondly, effective, 
deliverable and well thought through succession planning and contingency 
planning processes in place across the Group for all key positions.
With regard to Board appointments, following a detailed review by the 
Committee of the Board’s composition and the requirements of the 
Company’s strategy, it was announced on 10 January 2018 that a number of 
changes would be made to refresh the Board and its Committees:
 – Gwyn Burr joined the Board as an Independent Non Executive Director 
on 1 February 2018, bringing considerable experience including in the key 
area of customer service which will strengthen the Board’s expertise in 
this area.
 – Rob Rowley will stand down at the conclusion of the Annual General 
Meeting on 26 April 2018 as an Independent Non Executive Director after 
over eight years of distinguished service.
 – Kate Barker will succeed Rob as the Board’s Senior Independent Director 
with effect from 26 April 2018.
 – Humphrey Singer succeeded Rob as Chairman of the Audit Committee 
on 10 January 2018.
Kate’s and Humphrey’s respective appointments are a result of the Committee’s 
medium term Board succession planning activities over recent years. 
Guidance issued by the Financial Reporting Council (FRC) is that Nomination 
Committees should generally look deeper into the Company to identify future 
leaders for the business; adopt a wider outlook in identifying potential 
Directors; and look further ahead than any immediate requirement to replace 
an individual Director. The Committee has addressed this through the further 
development of the Company’s Talent Management Boards to identify future 
talent and ensure that associated training and development plans are in place, 
to identify those executives with short and longer-term potential to be 
Directors, and to encourage and assist their further development with this aim. 
The Committee has also focused increasingly on the skills of individual 
Directors, and of the Board as a whole, in assessing whether each has the 
necessary skill sets and whether there are any particular skills gaps, 
particularly in relation to the Company’s medium term and longer-term 
strategic direction and the Board’s ability to drive it effectively. More details are 
set out on page 58.
The Committee also welcomes the Hampton Alexander Review which is 
seeking to improve Board and senior leadership diversity across FTSE350 
companies by setting targets to:
 – Increase the target for women’s representation on FTSE350 Boards to 
33% by 2020.
 – Set a new target for women’s representation on FTSE100 companies’ 
executive positions at Board level and those that directly report to the 
executive committee members (including the Company’s GMT) to 33% 
by 2020.
Following the appointment of Gwyn Burr noted above, the Company currently 
has three women on its Board (30%) and six across the combined Board and 
GMT (35%) and is therefore already compliant with the proposed revised 
target for wider executive positions and moving closer to compliance with that 
for the Board alone which is expected to be reached when Rob Rowley steps 
down from the Board at the conclusion of the Company’s 2018 AGM.

taylorwimpey.co.uk Directors’ Report: Governance
The Committee has also reviewed processes designed to meet the 
requirement to publish on a Government website, during 2018, certain 
statistics and commentary around the gender pay gap during the tax year 
ended 5 April 2017. The Company strongly supports the Government’s 
initiative on gender pay gap reporting and looks forward to publishing 
its findings.
The Committee made good progress during 2017 and its achievements 
made during 2017 and its plans for 2018 are set out in the left hand 
column of page 67.
The key priorities of the Committee remain the following:
 – To regularly review the Board’s composition, balance, diversity, skill sets, 
and individual Directors’ time commitment.
 – To regularly review our succession and contingency planning across 
the business, and ensure that there is a clear link to individuals’ career 
development and professional development.
 – To drive the Company’s diversity and inclusivity agenda across all levels of 
our business.
 – To ensure the Group continues to have the necessary level of Board and 
senior management skills and leadership to deliver the strategy.
In meeting its objectives, both the Committee and the Board take into account 
diversity including gender. We fully support the various Government initiatives 
in this key area, including the ‘Beyond One by 21’ report and 
recommendations launched in 2016 by Sir John Parker, which seek 
to increase ethnic diversity on UK boards.
I can confirm that diversity and inclusivity remains very much on the 
Taylor Wimpey agenda with regular reporting now taking place including 
a specific annual update and discussion. Whilst we continue to make 
progress, we do of course recognise that there is still further work to be done 
in order to achieve our wider diversity and inclusivity strategy.
The Committee’s objectives, the strategy for delivering them, progress made 
towards them during 2017 and targets and plans for 2018 are described in 
more detail in this Report.
The Committee will continue to focus on ensuring that the present and future 
composition of the Board and the Group’s executive management 
is appropriate for the delivery of the Group’s strategy and that all relevant UK 
Corporate Governance Code (the Code) requirements continue to be met.

Committee purpose and responsibilities
The Committee has procedures in place with regard to maintaining a formal, 
rigorous and transparent process for Board appointments, ensuring that 
appointments to the Board are made on merit and assessed against objective 
criteria. The Committee guides the Board in regularly assessing whether there 
is an appropriate balance of expertise and skills on the Board and other 
diversity considerations. The Committee notes and welcomes the 2011 report 
from Lord Davies of Abersoch on Women on Boards (the Davies Report); the 
2015 Report which raised the target from 25% to 33% by the end of 2020; 
and the Hampton Alexander Review which extends the 33% target by 2020 
to include the executives at Board level and those that report directly to the 
executive committee members (for the Company this is the GMT).
The Committee oversees on behalf of the Board, and advises the Board on, 
the identification, assessment and selection of candidates for appointment to 
the Board. The Committee has a formal, rigorous and transparent process 
against objective criteria. A description of how appointments are typically 
made to the Board is set out below and this was followed in connection with 
the recent appointment of Gwyn Burr to the Board as an Independent Non 
Executive Director on 1 February 2018.

Taylor Wimpey plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 The Nomination Committee also guides the Board in assessing from time to 
time whether the Board has the correct balance of expertise and in arranging 
orderly succession planning for appointments to the Board and in respect of 
senior management positions across the business. This considers not only the 
immediate succession planning for Directors but also a deeper review into the 
Company’s management structure to identify those with longer term potential 
to develop into future successors in the medium to long term. The Committee 
also reviews Board composition in light of the Company’s strategy, to ensure 
as far as possible that new appointments help support the drive to achieve its 
strategic objectives and required skill sets.
Committee activities during 2017
As noted on page 67, the Committee met on two occasions during 2017 
and the activities at each meeting were:
 – Reviewed succession and 
contingency planning progress and 
further plans for:
 – The Board;
 – The Non Executive Directors;
 – Board Committees; and
 – The Executive levels immediately 
below the Board.
 – Reviewed progress and plans for 
developing talent
 – Reviewed progress and plans for 
contingency planning
 – Reviewed the Board composition
 – Reviewed the process to gather data 
for the Company’s Gender Pay 
Gap reporting
 – Oversaw the selection and 
appointment of Gwyn Burr as an 
Independent Non Executive Director
 – Oversaw consequent changes in the 
positions of Senior Independent 
Director and Chairman of the 
Audit Committee
 – Received an update of progress 
around Group succession planning 
and related development plans
 – Received an update on contingency 
planning for key Executives below 
Board level
 – Recommended to the Board, 
following a rigorous review of the 
individuals’ performance, that Kate 
Barker; Mike Hussey and Rob 
Rowley, who will each have served 
for in excess of six years as an 
Independent Non Executive Director 
at the time of the Company’s 2018 
AGM, should each continue in office 
and, with the exception of Rob 
Rowley who will stand down, be 
recommended for re-appointment  
at the AGM
 – Received an update on diversity 
and inclusivity
As highlighted in the Committee’s 2017 performance on page 67, a key focus 
of the Committee’s work during the year was on progressive succession 
planning at all senior levels of the Company with a view to identifying key 
prospects and tailoring training and development plans to allow them to 
demonstrate their potential for future progression. As part of this process, 
management below Board level is provided with regular access to the Board, 
including the opportunity to attend Board meetings and other Board-related 
functions in order to give presentations on specialist topics, project work and 
the performance of specific regional businesses and Divisions. This helps to 
provide valuable exposure to the Board for up and coming management as 
well as being extremely valuable for Board members in assessing the 
Company’s strength in depth.
The Committee meets formally at least twice a year. During 2017, in addition 
to overseeing the recruitment of Gwyn Burr as an Independent Non Executive 
Director and planning succession to the positions of Senior Independent 
Director and Chairman of the Audit Committee, the Committee’s principal 
agenda items consisted of longer term succession planning, reviewing and 
approving the contingency plan for key members of staff and considering 
progress on diversity across the business. Wider succession planning and 
diversity also remained on the Board agenda regularly throughout the year.
In addition, and in line with the Code, the Chairman and the Senior 
Independent Director, independent of each other, hold meetings at least 
annually with the Non Executive Directors without the Executive 
Directors present.
Information and professional development
The Company has procedures whereby newly-appointed Directors (including 
Non Executive Directors) receive a formal induction. This includes training and 
continuing familiarisation with the Company’s business, strategy, operations 
(including health and safety) and systems, the principles underlying the 
discharge of their duties as Directors and wider issues relating to the housing 
sector. The induction also includes meetings with key executives and function 
heads from across the business, advisers and site visits.
The Board recognises the importance of induction and training. These 
programs for Directors were reviewed during the year and are considered to 
remain appropriate.
All Directors visit Group operations on a regular basis, engaging with 
employees at all levels in order to foster and maintain an understanding of the 
business. Board visits are arranged each year to operations and at least one 
Board meeting per annum takes place either in, or at a nearby location with 
representatives from, a regional business over three days. In 2017, the Board 
visit, accompanied by the GMT, encompassed presentations on culture, 
customer services, digital, production and procurement; a planning update; 
and performance updates from designated businesses.
The Group Legal Director and Company Secretary acts as Secretary to the 
Board and its Committees and he attends all meetings. It is Board policy that 
wherever possible a formal agenda and reports are issued electronically to 
Directors in respect of all Board and Committee meetings at least one week 
prior to the meeting, in order to allow sufficient time for detailed review and 
consideration beforehand. Formal minutes are prepared in respect of all Board 
and Committee meetings and are then circulated and submitted for approval 
at the next meeting. All Board papers are circulated electronically and Board 
meetings have been effectively ‘paperless’ for several years, which has 
worked well and aided the overall efficiency of the wider Board process.
The Secretary provides regular briefings to the Board on regulatory and 
governance matters which are included as part of his formal regular reporting 
to the Board, and are supplemented, as appropriate, by briefings from 
independent advisers. The Board also receives regular briefings and updates 
on environmental, social and governance (ESG) matters.
May Oct
 69
taylorwimpey.co.uk Directors’ Report: Governance
The ESG briefings allow the Board to assess the significant ESG risks to the 
Company’s short and long term value and to identify any opportunities that 
may arise to enhance value. Details of ESG risks and value-enhancement 
pursuits appear in the Sustainability Report which will shortly be available on 
our website at www.taylorwimpey.co.uk/corporate/sustainability
The Chairman, Chief Executive and Secretary meet sufficiently in advance of 
each Board meeting in order to ensure action points from previous meetings 
have been implemented and to prepare the agenda and matters to be 
covered at the next and at future Board and Committee meetings as 
appropriate. The agenda and minutes for the Audit, Nomination and 
Remuneration Committee meetings are agreed by the Secretary with the 
relevant Committee Chairman.
Composition of the Board
It is the Company’s policy, in line with the Code, that proposed appointments 
to the Board, and succession planning, are based on merit, and judged 
against objective criteria, whilst also having due regard to the benefits of 
diversity and inclusiveness, including gender, age, ethnicity, thought and 
experience. Following the appointment of Gwyn Burr as an Independent Non 
Executive Director on 1 February 2018, the Board consists of ten Directors, 
three of whom are women, representing 30% of the Board. That percentage 
will become 33% when Rob Rowley stands down from the Board, as 
previously announced, at the conclusion of the 2018 AGM. The Board is 
therefore moving towards the increased target proposed by the Davies Report 
of 33% female representation by 2020. The Board aspires to reach and 
maintain that level of representation, whilst continuing to also have due regard 
to other aspects of diversity as outlined above.
The Committee also reviews the time commitments of each Director both prior to 
all appointments and periodically so as to ensure that all Directors can discharge 
their responsibilities effectively in line with the requirements of the Code.
Succession and contingency planning
During the year, succession planning for people at all levels of the organisation 
has continued to be a key area of focus for the Committee. As part of this, 
both the Board and the Nomination Committee have visibility of a wide range 
of employees with leadership potential together with their individual 
development plans. Each Divisional Chairman of the housing business chairs 
a divisional Talent Management Board (TMB) comprising senior executives of 
the Division together with HR representatives.
Each TMB then makes recommendations to the Group Talent Board which is 
chaired by the Chief Executive. These Boards regularly review succession 
planning and related development and training requirements across the UK 
Group. Further actions to support succession planning include the development 
of career paths linked to experience, exposure and education; an assessment 
and development centre; and the promotion of the Company’s mentoring 
scheme. We are also focusing upon recruiting individuals from a wider range of 
backgrounds, experience and industries at all levels.
Succession planning remains a key area of focus across all levels of the 
organisation. During the year, the Committee considered in detail short and 
long term succession planning for Directors and key executives, together with 
appropriate development plans. The Group Management Team (GMT) 
regularly reviews the Company’s succession plans and talent pipelines, with 
further action to support these areas continuing. The Committee also 
considered contingency and longer term succession planning for all senior 
roles, linked to talent development and targeted training programmes.
Contingency planning concerns the Company’s and the Board’s 
preparedness for, and responsiveness to, sudden and unexpected loss or 
non-availability of a key Board member, or one or more key executives. 
It involves the identification of suitable individuals within the Company who, 
either singly or in concert with another, can quickly assume a key role and 
provide effective support until the incumbent returns to work or, in appropriate 
cases, a successor can be identified and appointed.
Board succession
There were no changes in the composition of the Board during 2017 but a 
number of changes, mentioned earlier in this Report, were announced early in 
2018, some of which have already taken place and some which will follow 
upon the conclusion of the 2018 AGM:
Gwyn Burr was appointed as an Independent Non Executive Director on 
1 February 2018 and brings with her from her executive background and also 
more latterly her various non executive positions considerable experience and 
expertise, principally in the area of customer service, and will therefore 
enhance the overall skill sets of the Board. On her appointment to the Board, 
Gwyn joined the Nomination and Remuneration Committees, where her 
experience of past and current service on plc boards and remuneration 
committees will be of considerable benefit.
Rob Rowley stood down as Chairman of the Audit Committee on 
10 January 2018 and was succeeded in this position by Humphrey Singer.
Rob will stand down as an Independent Non Executive Director at the 
conclusion of the AGM on 26 April 2018 and will be succeeded as Senior 
Independent Director on that date by Kate Barker. 
The composition and performance of the Board and its Committees were 
considered during the year and it was concluded that the Board and each 
Committee will, in light of the changes outlined above, continue to 
function effectively.
The Committee believes that the balance of the Board, consisting 
of a Chairman, three Executive Directors and six Independent Non Executive 
Directors, recently augmented by Gwyn Burr’s wide-ranging additional skill sets, 
will continue to provide the right blend of experience, expertise and challenge in 
order to take the Company forward in line with its strategy whilst ensuring and 
maintaining good governance and best practice, and will continue to do so after 
Rob Rowley stands down. This will, however, be kept under regular review in 
line with the guidance set out in the Code.
At the AGM of the Company to be held on 26 April 2018, all Directors will 
again be subject to re-election or, in the case of Gwyn Burr, to election, by 
shareholders in accordance with the Code. Biographical details of each 
Director can be found on page 58.

Taylor Wimpey plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Nomination Committee Report continued Employee diversity
Diversity and inclusion remained an area of clear focus throughout 2017 which 
will continue into 2018 and beyond. A Working Party which includes a variety 
of members from across the business has been overseeing progress towards 
achieving the Company’s diversity and inclusion strategy and implementing 
new initiatives so as to improve our performance in these key areas and 
comply with the Company’s Diversity Policy as set out on pages 72 to 73. The 
strategy focuses on the challenges faced in developing an inclusive and 
diverse workforce with each regional business making commitment. This 
includes working with specialist external bodies to maximise all 
opportunities, including:
 – 21
st
 century leadership
 – Ensuring that our leaders understand their role in developing a more 
diverse and inclusive culture and have the relevant training and support 
to achieve this
 – Employer of choice
 – Ensuring that our working environment, polices, procedures and 
development and progression opportunities, support greater diversity 
and inclusivity 
 – Expanding our reach
 – Developing broader recruitment channels, understanding and 
embracing the diversity of our customers and workplace, and 
improving our engagement with them
The Board believes that by embracing diversity and inclusiveness the 
Company will better understand how people’s differences and similarities can 
be utilised for the benefit of not only the Company but most importantly also 
for individuals, society as a whole, and our customers. It is the Board’s view 
that having a diverse workforce will improve the Company’s ability to deliver its 
strategy; the homes that it builds; and its services.
Diversity has continued to be a key item on the overall UK governance agenda 
during 2017. Within Taylor Wimpey, diversity has remained a key priority for 
the Board’s agenda and this will continue to be the case during 2018. 
Although the Board will continue to appoint on merit, we recognise that 
boards will generally perform better when they include top quality people from 
a range of backgrounds and perspectives. Diversity will continue to be a key 
consideration when contemplating the composition and refreshing of the 
Board and indeed our senior and wider management teams.
As noted opposite, the Company has put in place systems to measure and 
monitor diversity around the Group more effectively.
The data becoming available from these improved systems has assisted in 
designing and implementing a number of improvements to Group terms and 
conditions which we believe should facilitate access to, and success at, work 
for all, such as the following:
A review of Gender Pay. From April 2017 the government has introduced 
gender pay gap reporting for all companies with more than 250 employees in 
the UK and we have met those requirements and our data will shortly be 
published. At Taylor Wimpey we are committed to creating a diverse and 
inclusive place to work. Our fair and transparent approach to recruitment and 
our people is one of the defining factors in Taylor Wimpey’s culture and future 
workforce. Embracing diversity enables Taylor Wimpey to succeed in a 
competitive market. We have implemented a Diversity and Inclusion Strategy 
which focuses on gender equality as well as other key promoting workforce 
policies that highlight positive approaches to employee diversity. Our action plan 
that supports gender equality sets out measures to challenge the traditionally 
male dominated culture of the construction and home building industries. 
Implementing a flexible working policy in our Southern Counties regional 
business. As a result of the initial trial a number of further businesses have 
also introduced revised flexible working arrangements which have been 
received positively. 
Established a Young Persons Forum in our West Scotland regional business 
in order to give young members of the business a forum to discuss 
business-related issues that are important to them. As part of this forum, the 
business has visited a number of universities and schools which included 
the females into STEM and construction event and Glasgow Caledonian 
Universities’ Think Ahead Project.
Gained exposure for the business and the work of the young persons’ forum 
at the young panel session at The Herald and Gen Analytics Diversity 
Conference in May.
The Group has progressed work with the Royal National Institute for the Blind 
(‘RNIB’) to audit the Company’s website for ease of access for visually 
impaired users and make any necessary changes.
During 2017 we have worked with an external partner to undertake a detailed 
review of accessibility for disabled people, whether employees; customers; or 
visitors; to our offices; sites; sales centres; and show homes around the UK. 
The report will be analysed and any appropriate recommendations 
implemented during 2018.
With regard to gender, as at 31 December 2017:
The Board consisted of nine Directors, two of whom are women (22%). At the 
time of writing this report the Board consists of ten Directors, three of whom 
are women (30%). Following the Company’s AGM on 26 April the Board will 
once again consist of nine Directors, three of whom will be women (33%).
The GMT, which is effectively the Executive Board of Taylor Wimpey UK 
Limited, our main operating company, consisted of 10 Executives, three of 
whom are women (30%).
Excluding one woman who held an interim Regional Managing Director 
position, there is one woman out of 24 Regional Managing Directors (4%). 
From 1 April 2018 this will increase to two women (8%) following the 
appointment of the interim Regional Managing Director into a Regional 
Managing Director role. 
Women across the Group account for 32% (2016: 32%) of the workforce.
28% (2016: 31%) of new starters with the Company during 2017 are women.
While we are making reasonable progress, we of course recognise that we still 
have more work to do in order to fulfil our overall diversity ambitions and, as 
stated on page 69, it is a priority for 2018 to achieve further progress in this area.

taylorwimpey.co.uk Directors’ Report: Governance
Progress of our diversity policy
The Company’s plans and progress in implementing its diversity policy, benchmarked against appropriate targets, are set out below. Progress is measured and 
monitored by the Nomination Committee and the Board. The Company is also committed to ensuring that our people are free from any direct or indirect 
discrimination, harassment, bullying or any other form of victimisation. Our grievance and harassment policies ensure that any reported incidents are 
investigated. In addition, our whistleblowing policy encourages employees to speak up, including through an independent ‘Safecall’ telephone facility, against 
any inappropriate practices or behaviour and we regularly publicise the policy to all staff and workers on site.
Diversity policy Strategy Progress
Taylor Wimpey operates in diverse 
communities. We believe that 
embracing this diversity will enable 
us to succeed through a workforce 
that is inclusive, creative and 
innovative. Diversity covers many 
aspects. We have defined diversity 
to mean that we actively embrace 
the business and local 
communities in which we operate 
and will strive to reflect their 
richness and character to include 
such aspects as gender, race, 
disability and religion but also 
diversity of thought, background 
and experience.
We will examine our 
culture and practices 
to determine what further 
actions can be taken 
to improve diversity 
and inclusion within 
Taylor Wimpey.
A Working Party continues to drive delivery of our Diversity and Inclusion Strategy and 
Action Plan. Significant progress continues to be made. 
It has always been the intention to expand the Working Party to ensure that it continues 
to reflect a diverse representation from across the Group. During 2017 we sent a request 
for new members which attracted nearly 100 applicants. 
As a consequence, the Working Party has been extended to a membership of nine 
members and the decision taken to introduce a separate BAME working group of 10 
members moving forward into 2018. This BAME working group will be focusing on how 
we can extend our reach to ensure that we attract and develop employees from a wider 
and more inclusive talent pool.
Building on the comprehensive training sessions delivered to the management teams of 
our regional businesses and Head Office functions in 2016, as planned further sessions 
were delivered in 2017 to newly-appointed Directors and Managing Directors. 
We also launched our Diversity and Induction e-learning to all employees in 2017. These 
two modules (one for all employees and one specifically for line managers) help users 
understand in more detail our commitment to building a more diverse and inclusive 
workforce as well as the roles and responsibilities they have in supporting our 
commitments. These are now key modules of our induction programme for new starters. 
To monitor progress we anticipate repeating unconscious bias testing across the 
business in 2018 and comparing the results to 2016. 
The Chairman of the Working Party and the Group HR Director continue to periodically 
contact all our Managing Directors to ensure the commitment to diversity and inclusion 
remains a key focus. 
Managing diversity is about valuing 
everyone as an individual – valuing 
people as our employees, 
customers and clients. People 
have different needs, values and 
beliefs. Our people management 
practice demands that 
employment propositions are both 
consistently fair but also flexible 
and inclusive in ways that assist 
our people while supporting our 
business needs and objectives.
We will identify people 
management practices 
that assist a diverse 
workforce to achieve their 
full potential.
We will use our 
Community Engagement 
Programme to heighten 
awareness of personal 
interaction and valuing 
individuals.
We will increase the 
opportunities for young 
people to join the 
Company and will 
promote continuous 
personal development.
We are proud of our involvement with the Leonard Cheshire Disability Change 100 
programme which we are committed to continuing to support. 
In 2017 we took five interns with a range of disabilities, both physical and mental, who 
worked across a wide range of disciplines.
We have continued to promote our ‘Employer of Choice’ and diversity agenda through 
numerous publications and recently participated in the Annual Diversity Awards that were 
sponsored by The Bank of Scotland, Glasgow Herald, and Genalytics.
Our West Scotland regional business was nominated for the ‘Recruitment of Talent’ 
award and sponsored the ‘Best Community Project’ award.
Taylor Wimpey are also participating in The Hampton Alexander Review, an independent 
review body which aims to increase the number of women on UK boards.
There has been a comprehensive review of our current dress code across the business. 
As a consequence, we have developed a new range, with a wider range of sizing, and a 
more modern feel and a commitment given to provide any item of clothing not available in 
the range for personal reasons e.g. religious belief. During 2018 we are committed to 
reviewing the provision of maternity wear, to ensure that it is fit for purpose and inclusive.

Nomination Committee Report continued Diversity policy Strategy Progress
We believe that everyone should 
have the right to equal access to 
employment and, when in our 
employ, to equal pay and access 
to training and career development.
We will ensure that all 
managers involved in 
recruitment and selection 
receive training that 
incorporates the areas 
of diversity and 
promoting equality.
We will extend our 
recruitment sources in 
order to attract  
a more diverse range  
of applicants.
We recruited 190 apprentices (2016: 147), including 53 site management apprentices 
(2016: 54), 28 management trainees (2016: 30) and 31 graduates (2016: 20). 
We recruited an increased number of employees with disabilities. Working with key 
partners we hope to increase more permanent and secondment opportunities for people 
with disabilities.
The new HR Information System is better capturing data relating to all aspects of diversity 
and inclusion.
During 2018, we intend to update the diversity and inclusion data we hold on our 
employees in the system. This was always an activity planned 18 months into the delivery 
of our Diversity and Inclusion action plan, as we continue to raise awareness, and embed 
a more diverse and inclusive culture. 
We continued to partner with a number of specific diversity partners in 2017 with 
an objective to drive the attraction and development of a more diverse and 
representative workforce.
We are continuing the diversity discussion group meetings with the Chief Executive, 
Group HR Director and different sections of the workforce, to further embed diversity and 
inclusiveness at all levels of the Company.
Diversity and Inclusion is also discussed as part of the bi-annual talent and succession 
reviews by the three Divisional Chairmen with the Chief Executive and Group HR Director.
We are keen to ensure that our website is accessible to those with sight impairment and 
in conjunction with the Royal National Institute for the Blind we are currently undertaking a 
website accessibility audit.
We are committed to ensuring that 
our people are free from any direct 
or indirect discrimination, 
harassment or bullying.  
We will not tolerate any behaviour 
that detracts from this.
We will encourage our 
people to speak out and 
report any direct or 
indirect discrimination, 
harassment or bullying. 
We will act promptly in 
addressing 
any inappropriate 
behaviour or practice.
A specific focus of the Company’s whistleblowing campaign is on diversity, encouraging 
employees to speak up against any inappropriate practices or behaviour.
Our grievance policy ensures that any reports of harassment or bullying are investigated 
and acted upon.
We acknowledge that we must 
continue to promote diversity in 
order to create an organisation that 
attracts, supports and promotes 
the broadest range of talent. 
Establishing an organisational 
culture with diversity as a core 
value will enable individuals to 
reach their full potential and provide 
the best service to our customers.
Diversity will be promoted 
from the highest level and 
we will ensure that our 
people understand the 
benefits of having a 
diverse and 
inclusive workforce.
Diversity is a core message within our strategy; a main item at our Executive and Regional 
Management meetings; and is a standing agenda item at GMT meetings.
In order to support each employee to maximise their performance and achieve their own 
personal goals we have designed a Cultural Principles framework where we describe the 
behaviours and attitudes we believe are required for effective performance in order to 
deliver our vision, mission and values. Encouraging and embracing diversity is an integral 
part of our philosophy.
The Careers section of our website includes a dedicated Diversity and Inclusion section 
highlighting our focus on this area.
During 2017, we introduced a female talent forum. Feedback was incredibly positive in 
terms of creating an environment where individuals could share personal challenges and 
development areas. This will continue through 2018.

Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee is chaired by Kate Barker. All members 
of the Committee are Independent Non Executive Directors as required 
by the Code. Its members are set out in the table below.
Dear Shareholder
On behalf of the Board, I am pleased to present the Directors’ Remuneration 
Report for 2017 for and on behalf of the Taylor Wimpey 
Remuneration Committee. 
I would like to emphasise that the Committee remains very mindful of the 
understandable focus on executive pay and the increasing importance of 
considering remuneration from both a broader employee and a wide societal 
perspective. The Committee is regularly apprised on market practice and 
corporate governance developments, including the proposals to strengthen 
the employee, customer and wider stakeholder voice and a new UK 
Corporate Governance Code to apply to reporting years beginning on or after 
1 January 2019. As mentioned elsewhere in this Annual Report on pages 23, 
51, 81 and 95, in this context, we are pleased to have established the Taylor 
Wimpey National Employee Forum. Although it is still early days, I very much 
look forward to working with this important new body. 
The Committee has continued its much-valued and long-established  
practice of engaging and consulting with its key institutional investors and  
with shareholder representative bodies about Executive Director remuneration. 
As in previous years, the Committee has taken account of all the feedback 
which it has received and is, as ever, very grateful for the constructive 
engagement that has taken place with regard to the 2017 outcomes and 
remuneration proposals for 2018. Shareholders approved the Remuneration 
Policy at the 2017 AGM, with a vote in favour of more than 98% and we are 
privileged to have had a strong track record of shareholder support on the 
Company’s remuneration matters. We will consider our Remuneration Policy 
again in 2018 to ensure that it remains relevant to the business strategy  
which will be refreshed in 2018, as outlined in the Chief Executive’s Statement 
on page 13.
The Committee remains firmly committed to ensuring that the remuneration of 
the Executive Directors and the senior management team supports and drives 
the Taylor Wimpey strategy. Our remuneration is based on a framework which 
both challenges and motivates the senior management team to deliver the 
strategy and value for our shareholders and wider stakeholder interests.
The table below summarises the performance measures in our current 
incentive plans and how these link to the Taylor Wimpey strategy and align the 
interests of executives with shareholders:

Taylor Wimpey plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 The Committee firmly believes in ensuring a strong alignment between its 
Executive Directors and senior management with the interests of the 
Company’s shareholders. Executive Directors’ interests continue to be aligned 
with those of the Company’s shareholders in three principal ways: 
 – Through the share ownership requirements in Taylor Wimpey (which the 
Committee keeps under regular review).
 – Via the requirement to defer each year one third of their annual cash 
bonus into shares, which are then required to be held in trust for three 
years (described in more detail on pages 84 and 87).
 – In line with current best practice, through the requirement to retain for two 
years after vesting the net post-tax benefit deriving from any vesting of the 
Performance Share Plan award, which will also continue to apply on any 
vestings under this Plan going forward.
Performance in 2017: Executive Incentive Scheme (Bonus) 
(EIS) and Performance Share Plan (PSP) outturn
The EIS and PSP operate with clearly defined performance measures  
set out at the start of each financial year. To assess performance at an 
underlying level, which is not distorted by one-off items in the financial 
statements such as movements in the value of the land bank, the financial 
measures for the EIS and PSP are calculated before any non-recurring items 
which could affect the position - either positively or negatively. This has been 
the Committee’s policy for many years and ensures a stronger and fairer link 
between reward and underlying performance. In accordance with this 
well-established policy, the profit-related performance measures for the 2017 
EIS and 2015 PSP awards were therefore calculated before the cost of the 
gross provision of circa £130 million (the provision), which the Company 
announced in April 2017 following the outcome of the Company’s review  
into historic leasehold structures.
On this basis, for the EIS, our trading performance for 2017 was again 
excellent, with full achievement against the range of challenging targets set for 
the Group EBIT measure (40% weighting ), Cash Conversion (20%) and 
Return on Capital Employed (ROCE) (20%). The Company also partially met 
the range of Customer Service targets (6% out of 20%) and this remains an 
important area of ongoing focus. Based on the performance of the Company 
against its targets, the EIS outturn for 2017 was 86% of the maximum bonus 
potential for the Executive Directors of 150% of salary before the application of 
Committee discretion as referred to below.
With regard to the PSP award granted in 2015, which measured performance 
over the three years to the end of 2017, the level of our trading performance 
delivered full vesting in relation to the 50% of the award based on ROCE and 
Cash Conversion. For the remaining 50% of the award, which is based on 
total shareholder return (TSR), our TSR over three years was 92%, which 
resulted in full vesting against the peer group based on FTSE companies 
ranked 51-150 (20% of the award) and partial vesting against the peer group 
of other listed housebuilders (30% of the award). On this basis, the 
performance across the four performance measures led to a vesting of 
77.71% of the 2015 PSP award. 
In judging the overall link between pay and performance, the Committee 
carefully considered the impact of the provision as referred to above in our 
2017 financial statements. The Committee has taken into account that the 
Executive Directors:
 – were not personally involved in the decision to introduce leases with 
doubling ground rent clauses that gave rise to the need for this provision; 
 – have not benefited financially in relation to past years’ incentive plans from 
this issue; and
 – proactively dealt with this issue since it arose, in a positive, transparent 
and equitable way that is in the long-term interest of shareholders as well 
as relevant current and future customers.
Notwithstanding the above, in recognising the impact of this issue in 2017 for 
our shareholders and on certain of our customers, the Committee decided to 
use its discretion to scale back the level of the 2017 EIS for the 
Executive Directors.
The level of scale back is equivalent to the maximum EIS opportunity relating 
to the Customer Service element of the 2017 EIS, which equates to 20% of 
the EIS (i.e. equivalent to 30% of each Director’s salary). While the provision 
did not relate directly to the Customer Service performance conditions of the 
EIS set at the start of the year, the leasehold review did however more broadly 
relate to customer service. The Committee believes that the scale back is a 
meaningful and proportionate approach to take, recognising not only the 
impact on shareholders and certain customers, but also taking account of the 
circumstances highlighted in the bullet points set out above. The impact of the 
scale back for each Executive Director is set out in the table below: 
 
Director
EIS as originally 
determined by the 
performance criteria Scale back 
Resultant EIS 
payable before 
tax/NI and deferral 
Pete Redfern £1,078,592 £250,835 £827,757
Ryan Mangold £542,110 £126,072 £416,038
James Jordan £500,775 £116,459 £384,316
The Committee was comfortable that the PSP award should vest ordinarily in 
accordance with the performance criteria, recognising that the Executive 
Directors are each significant shareholders and have significant interests in 
both the PSP and deferred shares under the EIS. On this basis, the 
Committee feels that they will have shared with our shareholders any impact 
on the share price that may have arisen, both in terms of the value of their 
holdings and the future vesting under the above-mentioned schemes.
Full details of the performance targets and the relative achievement against 
each, are set out on page 87.
How we will apply the remuneration policy in 2018 
The average annual salary increase being proposed throughout the Company 
is 2.5% and this increase will also apply to the three Executive Directors. As in 
previous years, salary increases for the year will take effect from 1 April.
The operation of the incentive arrangements for 2018 will be unchanged 
structurally from the plans which operated in 2017, which have successfully 
provided a broad assessment of performance against our strategic KPIs.
The 2018 EIS will retain the same measures and weightings, namely, EBIT 
(40%), ROCE (20%), Cash Conversion (20%) and Customer Service (20%) 
with 10% based on the National House Building Council’s (NHBC) eight week 
score and 10% based on the NHBC nine month survey. The financial 
measures remain closely aligned to our strategy and will also assist in the 
driving of other important financial measures.

taylorwimpey.co.uk Directors’ Report: Governance
Awards made in 2018 under the PSP will also be unchanged from 2017, 
based on PBIT Margin (15%), Operating Profit Cash Conversion (15%), ROCE 
(20%), and relative Total Shareholder Return (TSR) against a Housebuilders 
group (30%) and against the FTSE 100 (20%). Following our consultation with 
shareholders, we will however be amending how we calculate the Company’s 
TSR against the housebuilder’s group by reverting to a more conventional 
median to upper quartile range. This will be no less challenging to achieve but 
will make it more straightforward to calculate and, importantly, easier to 
communicate it internally to participants. The change will also align the 
method of calculation to the FTSE 100 TSR group measurement, which has 
been in place for a number of years.
Remuneration adviser
During 2017 the Committee undertook a review of its independent adviser, 
and after a competitive tender process, including the incumbent firm, Aon 
Hewitt New Bridge Street, who had been in position since February 2009, 
decided to appoint Korn Ferry as the Committee’s adviser with effect from 
20 July 2017. Both advisers are members of the Remuneration Consultants 
Group and signatories to its Code of Conduct. 
Membership of the Committee
I should like to take this opportunity to thank Rob Rowley, who will stand 
down from the Board at the conclusion of the Company’s 2018 AGM, for his 
contribution to the Committee’s deliberations since 2010.
I should also like to welcome Gwyn Burr who joined the Committee on 
1 February 2018 and brings wide experience of remuneration committee 
related matters.
We believe that the remuneration payable to the Executive Directors for 2017 
is appropriate, linked to performance delivered and, as evidenced by our use 
of discretion to reduce the EIS payments this year, has taken account of the 
broader circumstances within which incentive payments should be made.
I very much hope that you will again be able to support the level of 
remuneration paid with respect to 2017 and the way we will implement our 
policy for 2018.

Taylor Wimpey plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Remuneration Committee Report continued Introduction
This Report has been prepared to comply with the provisions of the 
Companies Act 2006 and other applicable legislation, including the Large and 
Medium-Sized Companies and Groups (Accounts and Reports) Regulations 
2008 (as amended) (Regulations), and has also been prepared in line with the 
recommendations of the UK Corporate Governance Code (the Code) and the 
UK Listing Authority Listing Rules.
This Report has been prepared by the Remuneration Committee on 
behalf of the Board.
The 2017 Remuneration Report includes disclosures which reflect in full the 
Regulations on remuneration reporting, divided into two sections:
 – Remuneration Policy Report: this sets out the Remuneration Policy 
adopted by shareholders at the 2017 AGM, describing the framework 
within which the Company remunerates its Directors. The Policy applies 
for a period of three years from the date of the 2017 AGM or until a 
revised Policy is approved by shareholders if sooner. The preceding Policy 
applied during the year from 1 January 2017 until the date of the 2017 
AGM, but was not materially different from the current Policy. 
 – Annual Report on Remuneration: this sets out how the Company’s 
Remuneration Policy was applied during 2017 from the date of the 2017 
AGM (and under the preceding Policy until that date) and how it is 
proposed that it be applied during 2018. The Annual Report on 
Remuneration will be subject to an advisory resolution at the AGM on 
26 April 2018. Details of the resolution and its status as an advisory vote 
are set out in the Notes to the Notice of Meeting on page 157.
The Regulations require that the Company’s auditors report to shareholders 
on certain parts of this Report and state whether in their opinion those parts 
have been properly prepared in accordance with the requirements. The 
Remuneration Policy Report, which describes the Committee’s current 
Remuneration Policy for Executive Directors and which has applied since its 
approval by shareholders on 27 April 2017, contains unaudited information. 
Some elements of the Annual Report on Remuneration, which describes how 
the Committee has implemented its existing policy in 2017, contain 
audited information.
Remuneration Policy Report
Unaudited information
The Company’s Remuneration Policy was subject to a binding shareholder 
vote at the 2017 AGM of the Company and was approved by 98% of 
shareholders who voted.
The Policy is designed to ensure that the remuneration framework will support 
and drive the Taylor Wimpey strategy forward by both challenging and 
motivating the Executive Directors and the senior management team to deliver 
it and drive value for our shareholders. The Policy is set out on pages 78 to 80 
and is also available to view on the Company’s website at www.taylorwimpey.
co.uk/corporate/investor-relations/corporate-governance
Policy overview
A key part of the Committee’s role is to ensure that the remuneration of 
Executive Directors and senior management is aligned to the Company’s 
strategic objectives. It is, of course, key that the Company is able to attract 
and retain leaders who are focused and also appropriately incentivised to 
deliver the Company’s strategic objectives within a framework which is aligned 
with the long term interests of the Company’s shareholders. This alignment is 
achieved through a combination of deferral into shares of a percentage of the 
EIS; a two-year retention period for vested PSP awards; and share ownership 
guidelines which require executives to build up holdings of Taylor Wimpey 
shares, either directly or by retaining vested PSP share awards. These 
guidelines, which the Committee regularly reviews and also seeks advice on, 
require Executive Directors to put in place a plan to accumulate a holding in 
the Company equivalent to their basic salary within five years of appointment, 
followed by a holding equal to twice their basic salary within a specified period 
to be agreed with the Chairman.
The Committee’s Remuneration Policy ensures that a significant percentage 
of the overall remuneration package of Executive Directors and senior 
management is subject to performance. With all packages for Executive 
Directors substantially geared towards meeting challenging targets set 
under the EIS and PSP, the Committee believes that the pay and beneﬁts of 
its Executive Directors and senior management adequately takes account of 
reward versus risk.
In line with best practice the Remuneration Committee ensures that the 
incentive structure for Executive Directors and senior management will not 
raise environmental, social or governance (ESG) risks by inadvertently 
motivating irresponsible behaviour. More generally, the Committee under its 
terms of reference may, where it considers appropriate, take ESG matters into 
account when considering the overall remuneration structure.

Element Purpose and link to strategy Operation Maximum Performance targets
Salary To recruit and reward 
executives of a suitable 
calibre for the role and duties 
required.
Salaries are normally reviewed annually to ensure 
that they remain competitive with external market 
practices and are competitive when measured 
against FTSE peers (other non-ﬁnancial companies 
of a similar size in terms of market capitalisation and 
other large UK housebuilders).There is no automatic 
entitlement to an increase each year.
Takes into account the following:
 – The performance, role and responsibility of each 
individual Director.
 – The economic climate, general market conditions 
and the performance of the Company.
 – The level of pay awards across the rest of the 
business.
 – Salary levels in comparably-sized companies and 
other major housebuilders.
The maximum annual salary increase will not 
normally exceed the average increase which 
applies across the wider workforce. However, 
larger increases may be awarded in certain 
circumstances including but not limited to:
 – Increase in scope or responsibilities of 
the role.
 – To apply salary progression for a newly /
recently appointed Director.
 – Where the Director’s salary has fallen 
significantly below the market positioning.
Company and individual 
performance are factors 
considered when 
reviewing salaries.
Chairman  
and Non 
Executive 
Director fees
The Chairman’s and 
Non Executive Directors’ fees 
should be in line with 
recognised best practice and 
be sufficient to attract and 
retain high calibre 
non executives.
Fees consist of a single consolidated fee for the 
Chairman plus the payment of a cash amount to 
cover his office expenses
1
, an annual fee for the 
other Non Executives and additional fees for the 
Chairman of the Audit Committee and the 
Remuneration Committee. An additional fee is also 
paid to the Senior Independent Director in 
recognition of the responsibilities of that role.
Set by reference to the responsibilities undertaken 
by the non executive, taking into account that each 
Non Executive Director is expected to be a member 
of the Nomination Committee and / or the Audit 
Committee and / or Remuneration Committee.
Reviewed periodically but generally annually and at 
least every other year. Takes into account levels in 
comparably-sized companies and other major 
housebuilders.
Fees are paid monthly in cash.
Non Executive Directors do not participate in any 
incentive, share scheme, benefits-in-kind or pension 
arrangements. The Chairman is entitled to 
participate in the Company’s private medical 
insurance scheme.
Any reasonable business-related expenses 
(including tax thereon) which are determined to be a 
taxable benefit, can be reimbursed.
Aggregate annual limit of £1 million imposed by 
the Articles of Association.
N/A
Other  
benefits, 
including 
benefits- 
in-kind
Provides a competitive 
package of beneﬁts to assist 
with recruitment and retention 
of staff.
The main benefits offered include:
 – Company-provided car or a cash allowance 
in lieu.
 – Provision of a fuel card.
 – Life assurance.
 – Private medical insurance.
 – A 5% discount on the price of a new home 
acquired from the Group in the UK or Spain.
Beneﬁts-in-kind are not pensionable.
Life assurance of up to four times basic salary 
and a pension of up to two-thirds of the 
member’s entitlement for a spouse on death in 
service, or in retirement, are provided, together 
with a children’s allowance of up to 100% of the 
dependant’s pension for three or more eligible 
children. The cost of these benefits is not 
predetermined.
The value of a company-provided car or a cash 
allowance in lieu is of a level appropriate to the 
individual’s role and is subject to review from 
time to time. The fuel card covers the cost of all 
fuel, for both business and personal use.
For home purchases, the price discount is 
calculated at the plot release price less the 
average discount to third party buyers for that 
house type on that development, less a further 
5% employee discount. No more than one 
home per annum can be acquired at a discount 
under the scheme.

Annual  
Bonus 
Scheme
(EIS)
Rewards the achievement of 
stretching objectives that 
support the Company’s 
annual and strategic goals.
Compulsory deferral in shares 
is designed to further align the 
interests of Directors with 
shareholders.
EIS awards are determined by the Committee after 
the year end, based on annual performance against 
targets set at the beginning of each year.
One-third of any EIS payable is deferred into shares 
for three years and held in trust. No further 
performance conditions apply.
Dividends or other distributions will accrue in favour 
of participants during the three year deferral period 
and will be received with any shares that vest after 
the applicable deferral period.
A malus and clawback mechanism applies to all 
participants in the event of a material misstatement 
of the Group’s accounts and also for other deﬁned 
reasons. The period of the clawback is three years 
from the date of payment.
No element of the EIS is pensionable.
The maximum EIS opportunity for 
Executive Directors is set at 150% of 
base salary. Target is set at 75% of 
salary and threshold at 0%.
The EIS measures are based on 
a scorecard of designated key 
annual financial, operational and 
environmental measures and the 
measures for 2017 are described 
in the Annual Report on 
Remuneration.
The Committee may vary the 
metrics and weightings from year 
to year according to strategy and 
the market, however financial 
measures will normally have the 
most significant weighting.
Long Term 
Incentive Plan 
(PSP)
Annual grants of share-based 
long term incentives assist 
with retention and the 
incentivisation and motivation 
of senior executives to 
achieve returns for 
shareholders through the 
inclusion of relative Total 
Shareholder Return (TSR) as 
a measure, driving further UK 
operating margin progression 
and improving return on net 
operating assets through the 
cycle. The use of shares and 
a post-vesting shareholding 
period helps align the 
interests of senior executives 
with those of the Company’s 
shareholders.
Executive Directors and other designated senior 
executives can receive annual awards of PSP 
shares.
Awards of PSP shares provide alignment with 
shareholders as they deliver (subject to meeting 
performance conditions) the full value of the shares, 
which can increase and decrease over the three 
year performance period.
Dividends or other distributions will accrue for 
Directors during the performance and holding 
periods and will be received with any shares that 
vest in favour of participants after the applicable 
performance period.
Performance measures are currently measured over 
three financial years.
A malus and clawback mechanism applies to all 
participants in the event of a material misstatement 
of the Group’s accounts and also for other deﬁned 
reasons. The period of the clawback is three years 
from the date of payment.
The maximum award (currently in 
performance shares) is normally over 
shares with a face value of 200%  
of base salary. In exceptional 
circumstances this can be increased 
up to 300%.
The targets and weightings for 
2018 are described in the Annual 
Report on Remuneration.
The Committee may vary the 
measures that are included in the 
plan and the weightings between 
the measures from year to year. 
Any changes to the metrics 
would be subject to prior 
consultation with the Company’s 
major shareholders. 
Awards vest 20% for threshold 
performance and 100% for 
maximum performance with 
straight line vesting in between.

provide competitive 
retirement beneﬁts that 
represent an appropriate level 
of cost and risk for the

Taylor Wimpey plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Remuneration Committee Report continued Committee discretion
The Committee fully recognises that the exercise of discretion must be 
undertaken in a very careful and considered way and that it is an area that will 
quite rightly come under scrutiny from shareholders and other stakeholders. It 
is however also important for the Committee to retain some discretion to 
make payments outside of its Remuneration Policy in exceptional 
circumstances. The Committee confirms that any exercise of discretion in 
such circumstances would be within the available discretions set out in this 
Report and that the maximum levels available under any relevant plans would 
not be exceeded. 
As mentioned earlier in this Report, the Committee decided that it was 
appropriate to exercise its discretion to scale back the EIS entitlement of  
the three Executive Directors in respect of the 2017 outcome, by 20% of the 
EIS (which equates to 30% of salary) to take into account the impact of the  
circa £130 million provision which was made following the conclusion of the 
review into historic leasehold practices.
With regard to both the EIS and the PSP, the Committee, consistent with 
market practice, retains discretion over a number of areas relating to the 
operation and administration of these plans but in all cases within the rules. 
These include (but are not limited to) the following matters (with the maximum 
level of award restricted as set out in the Policy table on pages 78 to 80):
 – Who participates in the plans.
 – The timing of grant of award and / or payment.
 – The size of an award and / or a payment, subject to the limits of the rules.
 – Discretion relating to the measurement of performance in the event of a 
change of control or reconstruction.
 – Determination of a good leaver (in addition to any specified categories) for 
incentive plan purposes based on the rules of each plan and the 
appropriate treatment chosen.
 – Discretion to dis-apply time pro-rating in the event of a change of control 
or good leaver circumstances.
 – Adjustments required in certain circumstances (e.g. rights issues, 
corporate restructuring, acquisition, divestment, change of control, special 
dividend or a change in prevailing market conditions).
 – The ability to adjust existing performance conditions for exceptional 
events so that they can still fulfil their original purpose.
 – Discretion to allow participants to sell, transfer, assign or dispose of some 
or all of their shares in exceptional circumstances before the end of the 
holding period, subject to such additional terms and conditions as the 
Committee may specify.
How shareholder views are taken into account
The Remuneration Committee appreciates and considers very seriously all 
shareholder feedback received in relation to remuneration each year and 
guidance from shareholder representative bodies more generally. Shareholder 
views are key inputs when shaping the Remuneration Policy and the 
Committee welcomes any comment or feedback on any aspects of 
remuneration and will always consider and respond.
The Committee regularly engages with its largest shareholders and 
shareholder bodies, regarding the ongoing Remuneration Policy and 
implementation, and will take into account any feedback when determining 
any changes that might apply. The last such consultation took place in 
December 2017 and included the proposed performance targets and 
weightings of both the EIS and PSP, and also the salary proposals for 2018 of 
2.5% to apply to all employees. The Committee also used the opportunity to 
consult with shareholders on the use of its discretion to reduce the level of the 
Executive Directors’ EIS as referred to above. 
The Committee follows the principles of good governance relating to 
Directors’ remuneration as set out in the Main Principles, Supporting Principles 
and Code Provisions of the Code. The Committee reviews and takes into 
account any governance related developments and guidance that arise, on an 
ongoing basis.
How employees’ voice is taken into account
The Committee supports and welcomes the ‘employee voice’ proposals 
currently under consideration by the Government, and in anticipation of this, 
the Company has already put in place the Taylor Wimpey National Employee 
Forum (the NEF) which will work with members of the Group Management 
Team and build upon the existing regional Employee Consultative Committee 
structure. Since it was established in late 2017 it has met on two occasions 
and received updates and provided feedback and input into specific matters 
such as certain remuneration related matters, customer service and other 
important operational matters. It is intended that the Chairman and the 
Remuneration Committee Chairman will attend the NEF from time to time and 
also seek feedback on specific topics via the Group Legal Director and 
Company Secretary, Group Human Resources Director or other Group 
Management Team members as appropriate.
How performance measures were chosen
The performance metrics that are used for each of the short and long term 
incentive plans have been selected to reflect the Group’s key strategic goals 
and are designed to align the Directors’ interests with those of the 
Company’s shareholders.
The EIS performance metrics include a mix of financial and non-financial 
metrics reflecting the key annual priorities of the Group. The financial metrics 
will generally determine at least 50% of the EIS and include earnings before 
interest and tax as this reflects the Company’s strategic objective to increase 
profit sustainably. The other financial metrics, selected on an annual basis, will 
be measurable and will ensure that executives are motivated to deliver across 
a scorecard of key objectives. The improvement of customer service remains 
an area of ongoing focus and the Remuneration Committee has therefore 
retained it as a challenging measure.
The performance conditions applicable to the PSP were selected by the 
Committee as they are consistent with the overall longer term success of the 
Company. TSR provides an external assessment of the Company’s 
performance in two ways. Firstly, against its competitors via an industry peer 
group and secondly, relative TSR measured against an appropriate sector of 
the FTSE. The latter has progressed over recent years, in line with the 
improvement in the Company’s share price and capitalisation, from the FTSE 
250 for 2014 awards; through to the 50 companies ranked immediately 
above and below the Company for 2015 awards; to the FTSE 100 for 2016 
and subsequent awards. It also aligns the rewards received by executives with 
the returns received by shareholders. The ROCE and Cash Conversion 
targets ensure that returns to shareholders and the generation of cash to fund 
them are the result of long term sustainable financial performance. PBIT 
Margin is a key indicator for investors and for the Company’s strategy of 
driving margin rather than volume.
The Committee will review the choice of performance measures and the 
appropriateness of the performance targets each year. Targets are set based 
on a sliding scale that takes account of internal planning and external market 
expectations for the Company. Maximum rewards require substantial 
out-performance of our challenging plans approved at the start of each year, 
with a significantly lower level of rewards for delivering thresheld 
performance levels.

External Non Executive Director positions
Subject to Board approval and provided that such appointments fall within the 
general requirements of the Code (and do not give rise to any conflict issues 
which cannot be managed by the Board and the Executive Director), 
Executive Directors are permitted to take on non executive positions with 
other companies. Executive Directors are permitted to retain their fees in 
respect of such positions. Any such appointments would be the subject of a 
public announcement to the London Stock Exchange.
Pete Redfern is an independent non executive director on the Board of  
Travis Perkins plc where he also serves on its Remuneration Committee and 
chairs its Stay Safe Committee. His current fees total £68,000 per annum 
(2016: £57,000).
Remuneration Policy for the wider workforce
When setting the policy for Executive Directors, the Committee is made fully 
aware of pay structures across the workforce. In addition, the Committee will 
conduct a formal review of relevant elements of remuneration across the 
Group and for all levels of employee every three years. The most recent such 
review took place in 2017 and its findings, which included data in preparation 
for the publication of gender pay gap information in April 2018, were that there 
were no inherent issues or evidence of inequalities on base pay, bonus and 
car benefits, or on pension arrangements which have been aligned.
Virtually all of the Company’s employees participate in incentive arrangements. 
Many employees can elect to take their performance-related payment in 
shares rather than cash, further enhancing the link and alignment between 
shareholder value and employee reward throughout the Company, which 
both the Company and the Committee consider important. For further details 
see employee involvement on page 96.
The Company also offers both Sharesave and Share Incentive schemes to all 
eligible UK employees with more than three months’ service.
Remuneration Policy on recruitment or promotion
Base salary levels will be set in accordance with the Remuneration Policy, 
taking into account the experience and calibre of the individual. Where 
appropriate, the Company may offer a below market salary initially with a view 
to making above market and workforce increases over a number of years to 
reach the desired salary positioning, subject to individual and Company 
performance. Benefits and pension will be provided in line with those offered 
to other Executive Directors, with relocation expenses provided for if 
necessary. Tax equalisation may also be considered if an executive is 
adversely affected by taxation due to their employment with the Company. 
Legal fees and other costs incurred by the individual may also be paid by the 
Company, if considered appropriate and reasonable to do so.
The variable pay elements that may be offered will be subject to the maximum 
levels described in the policy table on pages 78 to 80. The Company may also 
consider applying different performance measures if it feels these appropriately 
meet the strategic objectives and aims of the Company whilst incentivising the 
new appointee.
The above policy, which has not been used to date since its introduction, 
would apply to both an internal promotion to the Taylor Wimpey plc Board or 
an external hire.
In the case of an external hire, the Company may choose to buy-out any 
incentive pay or benefit arrangements which would be forfeited on leaving the 
previous employer. This will only occur where the Company feels that it is a 
necessary requirement to aid the recruitment. The replacement value would 
be provided for, taking into account the form (cash or shares), timing and 
expected value (i.e. likelihood of meeting any existing performance criteria) of 
the remuneration being forfeited. Replacement share awards, if used, will be 
granted using Taylor Wimpey’s existing share plans wherever and to the 
extent possible, although in exceptional circumstances awards may also be 
granted outside of these schemes if necessary and as permitted under the 
Listing Rules. To ensure alignment from the outset with shareholders, malus 
and clawback provisions may also apply where appropriate and the 
Committee may require new directors to acquire Company shares up to a 
pre-agreed level. Shareholders will be informed of any buy-out payments at 
the time of appointment. 
In the case of an internal hire including a promotion, as previously reported, 
the Company will honour any commitments entered into prior to their 
appointment to the Board even where it is not consistent with the Policy 
prevailing at the time such commitment is fulfilled.
Directors’ contracts
It is the Company’s policy that Executive Directors should have contracts of 
employment providing for a maximum of one year’s notice either way. This 
meets the requirements of the UK Corporate Governance Code. Service 
contracts for all Executive Directors and letters of appointment for all Non 
Executive Directors are available for inspection as described in the Notice of 
Annual General Meeting on page 153.
Each of the Executive Directors’ service contracts provides for:
 – The payment of a base salary (details of which are set out on page 84).
 – An expensed company car or a cash allowance in lieu; a fuel allowance; 
life assurance; and private medical insurance (details of which are set out 
on page 78).
 – Employer’s contribution to a pension scheme (details of which are set out 
on page 79).
 – A notice period by either side of 12 months.
 – A provision requiring a Director to mitigate losses on termination.
The service contract for each of Pete Redfern and James Jordan additionally 
provides for a pension allowance.
Each service contract contains the following performance-related provisions:
 – Participation in the EIS.
 – Participation in one or more long term incentive plan.
The Company has the right to terminate contracts by making a payment in 
lieu of notice. Any such payment will typically reflect the individual’s salary, 
bonus entitlement, benefits in kind and pension entitlements. The Company 
will be mindful, on termination of an Executive Director’s employment, of the 
need to mitigate costs and phase payments, which cease when the individual 
obtains an alternative role. There are no change of control provisions that 
apply in relation to the service contract of any Executive Director.
Other than in certain ‘good leaver’ circumstances (which could include by 
way of example redundancy, ill-health or retirement), no payment would 
usually be due under the EIS unless the individual remains employed and is 
not under notice at the payment date. Any payment to a good leaver under 
the EIS would be based on an assessment of their and the Company’s 
performance over the applicable period and pro-rated for the proportion of 
the EIS year worked.
Where an Executive Director is considered by the Remuneration Committee 
to be a good leaver, deferred EIS awards (shares) would vest. In other 
circumstances, awards would lapse.
With regard to long term incentive plan awards, the rules of the PSP provide 
that, other than in certain good leaver circumstances, awards lapse on 
cessation of employment. Where an individual is a good leaver, the Committee’s 
normal policy is for the award to vest on cessation of employment following the 
application of performance targets no later than the normal vesting date of the 
award and a pro-rata reduction to take account of the proportion of the 
applicable performance period outstanding post the cessation. The Committee 
has discretion to deem an individual to be a good leaver. The Committee also 
has discretion for both early vesting and reducing the impact of pro-rating. In 
doing so, it will take account of the reason for the departure and the 
performance of the individual through to the time of departure.

Taylor Wimpey plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Remuneration Committee Report continued In situations where an Executive Director is dismissed, the Committee 
reserves the right to make additional exit payments where such payments are 
made in good faith:
 – in discharge of an existing legal obligation (or by way of damages for 
breach of such an obligation);
 – by way of settlement or compromise of any claim arising in connection 
with the termination of a Director’s office or employment; or
 – to contribute towards the individual’s legal fees and fees for 
outplacement services.
The terms of engagement of the Chairman and the Non Executive Directors are 
regulated by letters of appointment over a term of three years, which are 
reviewed annually. Both the Company and the aforementioned Directors have a 
notice period of six months and the Directors are not entitled to compensation 
on termination other than for the normal notice period if not worked out.
All Executive Directors are proposed for re-election at the 2018 AGM and 
each will have at that date an unexpired service contract term of one year.
Service contracts and letters of appointment may be inspected at the 
Company’s Registered Office during normal business hours and at the AGM.
Legacy arrangements
Any commitment made which is consistent with the approved Remuneration 
Policy in force at the time that commitment was made will be honoured, even 
where it is not consistent with the policy prevailing at the time such 
commitment is fulfilled.
Annual Report on Remuneration 
This Annual Report on Remuneration will be put to an advisory shareholder 
vote at the 2018 AGM. The information in the Implementation of the 
Remuneration Policy during 2017 section on pages 85 to 92 has 
been audited.
Remuneration Committee
The role of the Remuneration Committee (the Committee) is to recommend  
to the Board a strategy and framework for remuneration for Executive 
Directors and Senior Management in order to attract and retain leaders who 
are focused and incentivised to deliver the Company’s strategic business 
priorities within a remuneration framework which is aligned with the interests  
of our shareholders and thus designed to promote the long term success of 
the Company.
The Remuneration Committee has clearly deﬁned terms of reference which 
are available on the Company’s website at www.taylorwimpey.co.uk/
corporate/investor-relations/corporate-governance. The Committee’s main 
responsibilities are to:
 – Establish and maintain formal and transparent procedures for developing 
policy on executive remuneration and for determining the remuneration 
packages of individual Directors, and to monitor and report on them.
 – Determine the remuneration, including pension arrangements, of the 
Executive Directors.
 – Monitor and make recommendations in respect of remuneration for the 
tier of Senior Management one level below that of the Board.
 – Approve annual and long term incentive arrangements together with their 
targets and levels of awards.
 – Determine the level of fees for the Chairman of the Board.
 – Select and appoint the external advisers to the Committee.
During 2017 the Committee comprised three Independent Non Executive 
Directors and also the Chairman of the Board. Kate Barker is the Committee 
Chairman and the other members of the Committee were Kevin Beeston, 
Angela Knight and Rob Rowley. Membership of the Committee is, and was 
throughout 2017, in line with the Code. Rob Rowley will stand down from 
the Board immediately following the AGM on 26 April 2018. Gwyn Burr 
became a member of the Committee following her appointment to the 
Board on 1 February 2018. 
Details of attendance at Remuneration Committee meetings held during 2017 
appear on page 74.
No Director or other executive is involved in any decisions about his or her 
own speciﬁc remuneration.
Advice to the Committee
The Committee keeps itself fully informed on developments and best practice 
in the ﬁeld of remuneration and it seeks advice from external advisers 
when appropriate.
The Committee appoints its own independent remuneration advisers and 
during the year it decided that the role of remuneration adviser, in which 
capacity Aon Hewitt New Bridge Street, part of Aon PLC, had acted since 
February 2009, should be the subject of a comprehensive review and 
competitive tender process. The outcome of the review, which was held in 
June 2017, was the appointment, from 20 July 2017, of Korn Ferry Hay 
Group (‘Korn Ferry’), who will act as remuneration adviser to the Committee 
going forward. 
Both New Bridge Street and Korn Ferry are members of the Remuneration 
Consultants Group and signatories to its Code of Conduct. Neither firm 
provides any other services to the Company. Although the wider Aon PLC 
group of companies provide insurance broking and, until 27 March 2017, 
provided pension administration support services to the Company, the 
Committee is entirely satisﬁed that the provision of such services did not 
create any conﬂicts of interest. The Committee reviews the performance and 
independence of its advisers on an annual basis and is satisfied that the 
advice provided is objective and independent.
The Committee also receives legal advice from Slaughter and May, the 
Company’s solicitors, as and when necessary. This generally relates to 
technical advice on share schemes and also with regard to any senior 
appointments and termination arrangements. The Committee is satisfied that 
the advice provided by Slaughter and May is objective and independent.
The fees paid to the Committee’s advisers in 2017 were: New Bridge Street 
£45,000 for the period to 19 July 2017 (2016: £99,470 for a full year) and to 
Korn Ferry £38,000 for the period from 20 July 2017 (2016: Nil). No significant 
amount of advice was sought from Slaughter and May during the year.
Pete Redfern (the Chief Executive), James Jordan (the Group Legal Director 
and Company Secretary), and the Group Human Resources Director each 
attend Committee meetings by invitation only but are not present for any 
discussions that relate directly to their own remuneration.

How the Remuneration Policy will be applied in 2018
Base Salary
The Committee reviewed the Executive Directors’ salaries in February 2018 
and has decided to award increases of 2.5% for each Executive Director, with 
effect from 1 April 2018, in line with the average increase made to 
all employees.
The salaries of the Executive Directors effective from 1 April 2018 will 
be as follows:
Name
Salary at 
1 April 2017
Salary at 
1 April 2018 Increase 
Pete Redfern £836,118 £857,020 2.5%
Ryan Mangold £420,240 £430,746 2.5%
James Jordan £388,198 £397,902 2.5%
Annual Bonus Scheme
The Executive Incentive Scheme (EIS) performance metrics and their 
weightings for 2018 are shown in the table below. The precise details of the 
targets themselves are deemed to be commercially sensitive as they relate to  
the current financial year. However, detailed retrospective disclosure of  
the targets and performance against them will be provided in next year’s 
Remuneration Report in the usual way.
Measure Weighting
EBIT 40%
Cash Conversion 20%
ROCE 20%
Customer service 20%
The above metrics and weightings are unchanged from the previous year  
and reflect the Group’s continuing focus on the key performance areas of 
earnings; cash generation; returns; and further improving customer services. 
One third of any bonus will be deferred in shares for three years without any 
matching element.
Long Term Incentive Plan
Taylor Wimpey Performance Share Plan (PSP)
In accordance with the Remuneration Policy, long term incentives comprise a 
PSP award with a maximum award of 200% of base salary (face value of 
shares at date of award). The annual awards granted to Executive Directors in 
2018 will be subject to the following performance conditions:
Weighting 
(% of total 
award)
Below threshold  
(0% vesting)

(100% vesting)
TSR v Peer Group 30% Less than

Awards vest on a straight line basis between these points. The Direct Peer 
Group Index of housebuilders is an unweighted index comprised of Barratt 
Developments, Bellway, Berkeley Homes, Bovis Homes Group, Countryside 
Properties, Crest Nicholson, Galliford Try, Persimmon and Redrow. 
The targets for 2018 are unchanged from those established for the 2017 
awards. This was considered in detail by the Committee and approved on the 
basis that these targets were challenging when introduced and each remains 
stretching and appropriate in the present market outlook for the medium term.
An underlying requirement for any vesting under the current share- 
based incentive plans is that at the time of approving the vesting, the 
Committee must be satisﬁed with the overall ﬁnancial performance of the 
Group. This will include inter alia the Company’s ROCE and 
Margin performance.
The Committee also retains the right (as part of its overall discretion) to reduce 
the vesting of the award if it considers that volumes (i.e. the number of homes 
sold) have not been satisfactory during the relevant performance period.
Dividend equivalents and other distributions will accrue on vested awards and 
continue to accrue to the extent awards remain unexercised post vesting.
PSP awards are subject to a two year post vesting holding period for 2018 
and future vestings.

The performance period for all elements of the 2015 PSP award ended on 31 December 2017 and the final measurement was undertaken based on this date, 
with the performance outcome being independently calculated by Korn Ferry and as part of the overall audit process.
The outcomes were as follows:

In deciding whether, and to what extent, any vesting of awards should take place under any LTIP, the Committee also considers the overall ﬁnancial 
performance of the Company during the period. The Committee has determined that the overall financial performance of the Company has been strong in 
respect of the performance periods of the above PSP award and therefore determined that the 2015 PSP awards should vest at 77.71% based on the 
achievement of three performance measures in full and one measure (TSR Peer Group) in part, as set out in the table above.

Directors’ interests in shares of the Company
Share ownership guidelines
The Taylor Wimpey share ownership guidelines are designed to encourage shareholding in Taylor Wimpey plc by executives at various levels within the 
Company for the purpose of alignment with the Company’s shareholders which the Committee strongly believes is very important. The guidelines cover the 
Executive Directors and those executives who participate in long term incentive plans with all participating executives required to build up shareholdings through 
the retention of shares vesting under the Company’s share plans.
The level of required shareholding for Executive Directors to attain is two times base salary. Executive Directors are expected to achieve a holding equivalent to 
one times base salary within five years of their appointment and although there will be no set time limit for achieving a two times salary holding, each Executive 
Director is required to agree a personal plan with the Chairman on the target to be achieved within an agreed time frame. Executive Directors are also required 
to retain at least 50% of their net of taxes gain arising from any shares vesting or acquired pursuant to the Company’s Long Term Incentive Plans, until such 
time as the guidelines have been met. Only beneficially owned shares count toward the guidelines, including the portion of the annual bonus (EIS) deferred into 
shares. The Committee will keep the guidelines under regular review.
As mentioned earlier in this Report, any shares that vest under the 2015 and later PSP awards must, as a standard requirement, be retained by executives 
for at least 24 months. The Chairman and the Non Executive Directors are also encouraged to hold shares in the Company in order to align their interests 
with those of shareholders.

transferred into the TWPS on 1 October 2013 and there was no change to members’ benefit entitlement. Pension beneﬁts include a two thirds spouse’s pension. Pensions accrued up to 5 
April 2006 are guaranteed to increase in payment in line with inﬂation limited each year to 5%. Pensions accrued after 5 April 2006 are guaranteed to increase in payment in line with inﬂation 
limited each year to 2.5%. Pensions accrued up to 5 April 2009 will revalue in deferment in line with inﬂation subject to an overall cap of 5% per annum. Pensions accrued after 5 April 2009 
will revalue in deferment in line with inﬂation subject to an overall cap of 2.5% per annum. The Company has only taken into account deﬁned beneﬁts accrued over the period to 31 August 
2010 and has not included any Deﬁned Contribution pension beneﬁts accrued after this date.
(b) Transfer values have been calculated in accordance with The Occupational Pension Schemes (Transfer Value) Regulations 2008.
(c) The transfer value includes the effect of ﬂuctuations due to factors beyond the control of the Company and Directors, such as ﬁnancial market movements.
Note: Pete Redfern and James Jordan received cash allowances of £200,340 (2016: £197,400) and £95,898 (2016: £94,500) respectively in lieu of Company pension contributions.
There was no change to beneﬁts during the year and consequently no difference between the changes to any Director’s pension beneﬁts in comparison with 
those of other employees.

appointed an Independent Non Executive Director on 1 February 2018.
The Directors together with their biographical information are shown on 
pages 46 to 47.
Retirement and re-election
The Company has determined that in accordance with the UK Corporate 
Governance Code (the Code), all Directors should seek election or re-election, 
as appropriate, at this year’s AGM as explained in the Notes to the Notice of 
Meeting and on page 59 of the Corporate Governance Report.
Each of the Directors proposed for election or re-election at the AGM is being 
unanimously recommended by all of the other members of the Board. This 
recommendation follows the completion of the annual Board evaluation 
process, which was externally facilitated this year by Manchester Square 
Partners. This included a detailed appraisal of the Board, its Committees and 
also in respect of each Director, which in turn included a review of their 
respective time commitments (save for Gwyn Burr as explained on page 156 
as she was appointed on 1 February 2018). Further information relating to the 
evaluation is set out in the Corporate Governance Report on page 61.
The Articles of Association of the Company further regulate the appointment 
and removal of Directors, in addition to the Companies Act 2006 and related 
legislation. The Company’s Articles of Association may be amended by 
special resolution of the shareholders. The various powers and responsibilities 
of the Directors are described in the Corporate Governance Report.
Qualifying third party indemnity
The Company has granted an indemnity in favour of its Directors and officers 
and those of its Group companies, including the Trustee Directors of its Pension 
Trustee Company, against the financial exposure that they may incur in the 
course of their professional duties as Directors and officers of the Company and 
/ or its subsidiaries / affiliates. The indemnity has been put in place in 
accordance with section 234 of the Companies Act 2006 in respect of which 
the Company took advice from its corporate lawyers, Slaughter and May.
Audit and auditor 
Each Director has, at the date of approval of this Report, formally 
confirmed that:
 – To the best of his or her knowledge there is no relevant audit information 
of which the Company’s auditor is unaware.
 – He or she has taken all the steps that they ought to have taken as a 
Director in order to make themselves aware of any relevant audit 
information and to establish that the Company’s auditor is aware of 
that information.
This confirmation is given and should be interpreted in accordance with the 
provisions of section 418 of the Companies Act 2006.
Deloitte LLP (Deloitte) have confirmed their willingness to continue in office as 
auditor of the Company. Following a review by the Audit Committee of their 
effectiveness, details of which are set out on page 65, a resolution to 
re-appoint Deloitte will be proposed at the AGM. 
It is the Company’s general policy that its auditor will not carry out non-audit 
services except where it is appropriate to do so and in accordance with the 
Company’s formal policy for the carrying out of such work. In addition, and in 
line with the Code, the Committee takes into account the relevant ethical and 
auditing professional standards guidance regarding the provision of non-audit 
services by the external auditor. The Company has reviewed the policy in light 
of the new regulation set out on page 65 which applied to the Company from 
1 October 2017. Any revision to current regulations or guidelines will be taken 
into account in framing the Company’s policy going forward and reported on 
in future Annual Reports as appropriate. Deloitte provided non-audit services 
to the Group during the year within the policy framework as described in the 
Audit Committee Report, details of which are set out in Note 6 on page 116.

Statutory, Regulatory and Other Information Directors’ Report: Governance
Annual General Meeting
The AGM will be held at 11:00 am on 26 April 2018 at The British Medical 
Association, BMA House, Tavistock Square, London, WC1H 9JP.
Formal notice of the AGM including details of the special business being 
proposed is set out in the Notice of Meeting on pages 151 to 157 and on the 
Company’s website at www.taylorwimpey.co.uk/corporate. In line with recent 
practice and good governance, voting on all resolutions at this year’s AGM will 
again be conducted by way of a poll. The Board believes that this method of 
voting gives as many shareholders as possible the opportunity to have their 
votes counted as part of the process, whether their votes are tendered by 
proxy in advance of, or in person at, the AGM.
Web communication
With shareholders’ consent, the Company has adopted web communication. 
The benefits of web communication are that it:
 – enables the Company to significantly reduce its printing and 
postage costs;
 – enables shareholders to access information faster, on the day documents 
are published on the Company’s website; and
 – reduces the amount of resources consumed, such as paper, and 
therefore helps to reduce the impact of printing, mailing and related 
activities on the environment. 
Shareholder communications (including the 2017 Annual Report and 
Accounts) are available electronically through the Company’s website.
Over 85% of the Company’s shareholders use either electronic or 
web communication.
The Company will of course continue to provide hard copy documentation to 
those shareholders who have requested this and is, of course, happy to do so.
Registrar
The Company’s registrar is Link Asset Services (formerly known as Capita 
Asset Services). Their details, together with information on the services and 
facilities available to shareholders, are set out in the Shareholder Facilities 
section on pages 158 to 159.
Capital structure
Details of the Company’s issued share capital, together with information on 
the movements in the Company’s issued share capital during the year, are 
shown in Note 22 on page 132.
The Company has two classes of shares: Ordinary Shares of 1p, each of 
which carries the right to one vote at general meetings of the Company and 
such other rights and obligations as are set out in the Company’s Articles of 
Association, and Deferred Shares which carry no voting rights.
The authority given by shareholders at the AGM held on 27 April 2017 for the 
Company to purchase a maximum of 327,136,000 of its own shares 
remained valid at 31 December 2017. The authority was not exercised during 
2017 or prior to the date of this Report. The Company has no current intention 
of exercising this authority but will nevertheless be seeking the usual renewal 
of this authority at the AGM and the Board will continue to keep the position 
under regular review. The Company currently holds no shares in treasury.
There are no specific restrictions on the size of a holding, the exercise of 
voting rights, nor on the transfer of shares, which are governed by the Articles 
of Association and prevailing legislation. The Directors are not aware of any 
agreement or agreements between holders of the Company’s shares that 
may result in restrictions on the transfer of securities or on voting rights.
Details of employee share schemes are set out in the Remuneration Report 
on pages 79 and 80. The Employee Share Ownership Trusts which hold 
shares on trust for employees under various share schemes, generally abstain 
from voting at shareholder general meetings in respect of shares held 
by them.
No person has any special rights of control over the Company’s share capital 
and all issued shares are fully paid.
Substantial interests
The persons set out in the table below have notified the Company pursuant to 
Rule 5.1 of the Disclosure and Transparency Rules of their interests in the 
ordinary share capital of the Company.
At 27 February 2018, no change in these holdings had been notified nor, 
according to the Register of Members, did any other shareholder at that date 
have a disclosable holding of the Company’s issued share capital.
Directors’ interests, including interests in the Company’s shares, are shown in 
the Remuneration Report on page 91. The Board strongly believes in 
the alignment of interests between senior management and the 
Company’s shareholders.
Substantial interests in the Company’s shares were as follows:

Dividend
An interim ordinary dividend of 2.30 pence per ordinary share was paid on 
3 November 2017 and the Directors recommend a final ordinary dividend of 
2.44 pence per ordinary share which, together with the interim dividend, 
increases the total ordinary dividend for the year to 4.74 pence (2016: 2.82 
pence). Information relating to the recommended 2017 final ordinary dividend is 
set out in the Chairman’s Statement on page 8 and in the notes to resolution 2 
on page 155 in the Notes to the Notice of Annual General Meeting.
The Directors also recommend a special dividend for 2018 of 10.4 pence per 
ordinary share (2017: 9.2 pence). Information relating to the recommended 
2018 special dividend is set out in the Chairman’s Statement on page 8 and 
in the notes to resolution 3 on page 155 in the Notes to the Notice of Annual 
General Meeting.
The Company will be operating a Dividend Re-Investment Plan (DRIP), further 
details of which are set out on page 158 of this Annual Report. The DRIP will 
operate automatically in respect of the 2017 final ordinary dividend for those 
shareholders who have previously registered a DRIP mandate (unless varied 
by shareholders beforehand) and also in respect of all future dividends, 
including special dividends, until such time as each participating shareholder 
elects to withdraw from the DRIP, or the DRIP is suspended or terminated in 
accordance with the Terms and Conditions of the plan. The Board will 
continue to keep the availability of the DRIP under regular review.
Shareholders are again reminded to check their position with regard to any 
dividend mandates that are in place, should they either wish to participate in 
the DRIP or discontinue or vary any participation, as existing mandates will 
apply to all dividend payments (including special dividends) unless or 
until revoked.
The right to receive any dividend has been waived in part by the Trustee of the 
Company’s Employee Share Ownership Trusts (ESOTs) over those Trusts’ 
combined holding of 13,052,331 shares. More details of these ESOTs are 
contained in Note 25 on pages 133 to 134.

Architects, looking for exciting new ideas in home design. Through 2017 our 
regional teams have been working with the competition winners Openstudio, 
to develop their designs for use in three trial sites. Each of the three sites will 
use a different construction method, traditional masonry, timber frame, or CLT 
(cross laminated timber) allowing us to compare the production efficiency and 
energy performance of differing construction methods as well as the design 
opportunities given by the designs. The completed trials are due to be 
delivered in 2018. 
Openstudio Architects’ Infinite House is a set of contemporary housing 
prototypes designed to offer maximum flexibility, customisation and cost 
efficiency, and to maximise levels of natural light and the perception of space. 
The Infinite House’s external envelope allows it to adapt to suit different 
contexts without appearing to be a repeated house type, maintaining the 
efficiency and cost-effectiveness of repetition and structural standardisation.
During 2017 we also instigated a Direct Labour pilot involving six business 
units to determine the feasibility of increasing our direct labour workforce. 
Through many industry wide reports and internal analysis it is evident that the 
industry as a whole has a considerable challenge ahead regarding the 
capacity and capability of key trades within our future workforce. We currently 
have limited control over our subcontractor base in terms of their size, growth, 
mobility, skills, training, recruitment and commitment. We have therefore taken 
this opportunity to pilot growth in our direct labour pool which will allow Taylor 
Wimpey to construct a sustainable work force which will be able to address 
current and future market challenges in volume and quality. 
The Project 2020 development initiatives in respect of our alternative build 
methods were concluded in the early part of 2017. The build method that 
excelled in the trials above all others was timber frame. This is a well-
established method of construction with a wealth of industry knowledge and 
by coincidence is already extensively used by us in Scotland.
A strategy was developed and a target set to increase the usage of timber 
frame to 20% of all completions by 2020. Throughout 2017 the strategy 
progressed in the development of a set of standard timber frame house 
designs complemented by a set of standard timber frame construction and 
system details. These house designs and details will provide the foundation for 
the future in setting one national standard. Timber frame sites and plot 
completions have already been identified and are progressing in line with 
the strategy milestones.
In 2017, we completed a further phase of development of our Carbon Futures 
approach to quantify the carbon dioxide emissions for entire sites. This 
approach takes into account the buildings but also the carbon absorption of 
green and blue infrastructure throughout the site. In 2018 we plan to get the 
Carbon Futures approach verified by the leading consultancy the Carbon 
Trust. Also in 2017 we supported the Horizon Group at the Supply Chain 
Sustainability School. The Horizon Group is a collaboration between the 
construction industry and leading construction academics. Its vision is of a 
supply chain with greater capability to deliver a sustainable built environment 
through the development and implementation of collaborative research.
Employee involvement and communication
We are proud of how committed our employees are to Taylor Wimpey and 
the long term success of our business. We strive to listen to and engage with 
all staff and employees. During 2017 we completed a further Talkback Survey, 
with the overall results continuing to be extremely positive. The response rate 
significantly improved from 55% in 2015 to 72% with a particularly pleasing 
increase from our weekly paid site based employees where we saw an 
improvement from 18% in 2015 to 67% in 2017.
Whilst there was no change in the overall employee engagement which 
remains at a strong 93%, further high scores in “willing to go the extra mile” – 
97% and “proud to work for TW” – 95% were seen. It was also very pleasing 
to see improved scores in areas such as customer service, flexible working, 
training, benefits package and how employees feel that our cultural principles 
make Taylor Wimpey a better place to work, which were clear areas of focus 
following the 2015 survey.
Looking ahead, the areas of focus for the forthcoming period are: how we  
can continue to improve our collaboration; how we can work together more 
effectively; and how we ensure employees have the tools and resources they 
need to do their job.
Building on our approach to communication, we produced a short video clip, 
as well as a paper based report, for all employees summarising the 2017 
results which was well received.
We continue to maintain our active employee consultation committees in our 
regional business units and communicate with employees via our half yearly 
Teamtalk employee magazine and regular Teamtalk Express email 
newsletter. Our intranet includes a wide range of employee information from 
human resources policies to advice for employees on sustainable living. It 
also includes an ‘Open Door’ forum that puts employees directly in touch 
with our Chief Executive. 
During 2017 building on the ‘employee voice’ initiatives considered by the 
Government we established a National Employee Forum (the NEF). Chaired 
by Tim Betts, Divisional Managing Director, the first NEF meeting took place 
in October 2017, with topics discussed including customer service and 
business attire.
With a minimum of two meetings anticipated annually it remains the intention 
that the Chairman and the Remuneration Committee Chairman will attend the 
NEF from time to time and also seek feedback on specific topics via the 
Group Legal Director and Company Secretary or other Group Management 
Team members as appropriate.
The Company is committed to ensuring open and regular communication 
throughout the Group on both business-related issues and items of general 
interest. There is a formal Employee Consultation Committee structure in 
place in all operations and elected representatives meet with management to 
consult on appropriate issues. Intranet systems are continually updated which 
provide a valuable communication tool across the Group and an important 
facility for providing employees with access to a wide range of information. 
Information is regularly cascaded throughout the Group via email – including 
regular communications from the Chief Executive – and via verbal briefings 
and management presentations. The Company’s internal magazine provides 
a further communication option.
We have also utilised social media to inform our employees of developments 
around the Company and to invite their feedback on them. Our employees 
have enthusiastically engaged with this new internal communication channel 
and we have seen an increase in the sharing of best practice; employees 
interacting in a wider business sense; and the spread of knowledge around 
the Group. Around half of our employees now post and engage on a regular 
basis and usage and membership is growing steadily.
During 2017, we also saw the launch of our first e-learning modules, which 
can be accessed via any PC, laptop tablet or mobile phone. Forming part of 
our induction process for new employees, the four modules provide useful 
information in an engaging and interactive format in the following areas:
 – Welcome to Taylor Wimpey – this e-learning module navigates users 
around the company, tells them what our business is about and gives  
an overview of the different functions. This is particularly useful for 
employees who enter the business from a non-housebuilding 
background. 
 – The role of a PLC – this module informs users about the different  
elements of what it means to be a fully listed public limited company 
(PLC), the rules and processes around this and the corporate governance 
we must adhere to. It also provides an overview of shareholder and 
board responsibilities.
 – Diversity and Inclusivity – these two modules (one for all employees  
and one specifically for line managers) help users understand in more 
detail our commitment to building a more diverse and inclusive  
workforce as well as the roles and responsibilities they have in  
supporting our commitments.

taylorwimpey.co.uk Directors’ Report: Governance
 – The Modern Slavery Act – the Modern Slavery Act aims to tackle slavery 
in the UK and came into effect in March 2015. The module outlines Taylor 
Wimpey’s commitment to tackling modern slavery and how all employees 
can play their part. We are also raising awareness more generally around 
Data Protection and the new GDPR regime.
Whilst they do form part of our induction for new employees, in view of the 
useful content, we also made these available to existing employees. 
In addition, as we continue to focus on retaining our employees during 
increasing challenges across the Industry such as skill shortages, we embarked 
on a series of business unit roadshows during 2017. The focus is to 
communicate and raise awareness of benefits offered as part of our total 
reward offer. Where necessary we have tailored the presentations to suit  
local requirements and audiences.
Continuous development of our career site’s look and feel, as well as its 
performance, is key to how we appeal to and engage with potential 
candidates. Throughout the year we have looked to add more content, links 
and videos to increase engagement and application conversions. This year we 
saw an overall increase in visits and a real spike in activity during the graduate 
recruitment drive. 
We have added video content to ensure prospective candidates from outside 
of our sector are clear on what our technical functions are responsible for 
delivering. The videos also promote diversity, career development and culture 
– three areas that are integral to developing and maintaining a strong 
employment brand.
Externally we have driven more content on career partner sites such as 
LinkedIn and Glassdoor which has resulted in increased page views for our 
company profiles and more followers. This culminated in being rated 15
th
 in 
the Glassdoor 2018 Best Places to Work survey. 
The Company promotes employee share ownership as widely as possible 
across the business. In addition to the various share-related reward plans 
described in the Remuneration Report on pages 79 to 80, the Company also 
offers a scheme whereby employees who do not participate in the Annual 
Bonus Scheme (cash bonus scheme) are offered the opportunity each year to 
exchange any cash bonus awarded for exceptional performance, into shares 
of the Company, offering a 20% enhancement to the value if taken entirely in 
shares and retained for a designated period. The scheme has operated since 
2012 and in 2017 resulted in 349,835 shares (2016: 333,307) being acquired 
by 289 employees (2016: 281).
In addition to the above, the Company also maintains two all-employee share 
plans, namely, the Save As You Earn share option plan and the Share 
Incentive Plan (SIP), which are offered as widely as possible across the Group. 
The proportion of our eligible employees who either participate in one or both 
plans or who are already shareholders of the Company has risen to 57%.
Equal opportunities
We strive to treat our employees fairly and with respect at all times. We have 
policies and processes in place to ensure that we act in accordance with our 
vision, mission and values which encompass equal opportunities, anti-
harassment and bullying, anti-corruption and whistleblowing. We encourage 
our employees and subcontractors to speak up about concerns over any 
wrongdoing at work and provide access to an independent reporting 
hotline service.
We remain committed to the belief that embracing diversity and inclusion will 
enable Taylor Wimpey to succeed through a workforce that is creative and 
innovative. We continue to actively embrace the local communities in which 
we operate and will strive to reflect their richness and character, including 
such aspects as gender, race and religion but also diversity of thought, 
background and experience.
As set out in our Diversity Policy, we remain committed to equality of opportunity 
in all of our employment practices, policies and procedures across the Group. 
To this end, within the framework of applicable law, we are committed, 
wherever practicable, to achieving and maintaining a workforce which broadly 
reflects that of the local catchment area within which we operate.
No employee or potential employee will receive less favourable treatment due 
to their race, creed, colour, nationality, ethnic origin, religion, political or other 
opinion, affiliation, gender, sexual orientation, marital status, family 
connections, age, membership or non-membership of a trade union, or 
disability. We are committed to making reasonable adjustments wherever 
possible. In exceptional circumstances, for example due to health and safety 
considerations on construction sites, some adjustments are not possible. 
Instruction on equal opportunities is part of the induction programme and we 
have created two diversity e-learning educational modules which will help 
employees to understand in more detail our commitment to building a more 
diverse and inclusive workforce.
Our Diversity Policy can be found on the Company’s website at 
www.taylorwimpey.co.uk/corporate/sustainability/our-policies
Employment of people with disabilities
It is our policy that people with disabilities should have fair consideration for all 
vacancies within the Group.
The Company is therefore committed, where possible, to ensuring that people 
with disabilities are supported and encouraged to apply for employment and 
to achieve progress once employed. They will be treated so as to ensure that 
they have an equal opportunity to be selected, trained and promoted. In 
addition, every reasonable effort is made for disabled persons to be retained in 
the employment of the Group by investigating the possibility of making 
reasonable adjustments to the job, workplace or equipment.
We have increased the number of employees with disabilities recruited. 
Working with key partners, we hope to increase more permanent and 
secondment opportunities for people with disabilities.
For example, we continue to engage with the Leonard Cheshire Disability 
Change 100 Programme, a charity that provides talented disabled students 
with the opportunity to participate in a 100 day summer internship and 
professional development programme. Feedback from the students who 
participated in the programme in 2017 has been very positive and we intend 
to engage with the programme further during 2018.
Modern Slavery Act 
The Company welcomes the aims and objectives of the Modern Slavery Act 
2015 and continues to take its responsibilities under the Act with the 
seriousness that it requires and deserves. A dedicated team meets regularly 
to ensure that objectives continue to be met. The Company will shortly be 
publishing its second statement under the Modern Slavery Act 2015. It will be 
available on our website at www.taylorwimpey.co.uk
Charitable donations
We support charities and issues that are relevant to our business, 
communities, partners and people. We aim to make a positive impact through 
donations of time, money and materials and through encouraging our 
employees to get involved. We focus on smaller national charities as well as 
regional and local organisations where we can have a significant impact and 
our employees can be active participants.
We want to understand the difference that we are making to our charity 
partners and how we can increase our impact. We carried out a number of 
site visits to our partners during the year and used their feedback to help 
direct our future donations. For example, following a visit to St Mungo’s we 
are now covering the cost of their employing a trainer to improve the skills and 
expertise of their staff.
Our national charitable donations are overseen and prioritised by our Charity 
Committee. The Charity Committee members include senior executives such 
as our Group Legal Director and Company Secretary and Group Human 
Resources Director, as well as a combination of employees from across the 
business including mid-management and junior staff such as land managers, 
personal assistants and graduate trainees. In addition to the national charities 
we support, our regional businesses have a discretionary charity budget to 
support a number of other local charities and initiatives.
96 
Taylor Wimpey plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Statutory, Regulatory and Other Information continued We focus on charitable initiatives that support:
 – Aspiration and education: Projects which promote aspiration and 
education in disadvantaged areas
 – Tackling homelessness: Intervening and improving homeless situations for 
seriously economically disadvantaged groups in the UK
 – Local projects: Initiatives that have a direct link with our regional 
businesses and developments 
During the year, Group companies donated £816,000 (2016: £763,000) to 
various charities, the majority of which were in the UK. We recognise that 
volunteering can be beneficial for the charities we support, the communities in 
which we work and for our employees’ development and self-awareness. 
Following the introduction of our Volunteering Policy in 2016, whereby 
employees are entitled to take up to four half-days (or two full days) paid leave 
per year, many employees at all levels around the country gave up their work 
and free time to participate in fundraising events for charitable causes 
including St. Mungo’s; The Youth Adventure Trust; CRASH; Crisis UK and 
CentrePoint, which raised a further £295,000 (2016: £270,000).
Further information on the Group’s donations, activities and initiatives can be 
found in ‘Optimising and enhancing value’ on page 35 and in the Sustainability 
Report 2017 which will shortly be available on the Company’s website: www.
taylorwimpey.co.uk/corporate/sustainability
Political donations
The Company has a policy of not making donations to political parties, and 
has not made any this year and neither does it intend to make any going 
forward. The Company does support certain industry-wide and trade 
organisations which directly assist the house building industry such as the 
Home Builders Federation and the Confederation of British Industry. Whilst we 
do not regard this support as political in nature in any way, the Companies Act 
2006 definition of ‘political organisations’ and related terms is very wide and in 
certain circumstances a donation, subscription or membership fee paid to 
such organisations or to a charity could retrospectively be categorised as a 
political donation from a strict legal perspective. Accordingly, as a matter of 
prudent corporate governance, the Company will therefore be seeking the 
usual annual dispensation from its shareholders at the 2018 AGM, so as to be 
able to continue with the above memberships and make charitable donations 
up to defined levels, without inadvertently breaching the applicable legislation.
Agreements
The Company’s borrowing and bank facilities contain the usual change of 
control provisions which could potentially lead to prepayment and cancellation 
by the other party upon a change of control of the Company. There are no 
other significant contracts or agreements which take effect, alter or terminate 
upon a change of control of the Company.
Branches
A subsidiary has a branch in Spain, the former activities of which were taken 
over some years ago by our Spanish subsidiary Taylor Wimpey de España 
S.A.U. whose details appear on page 159.
Important events since the year end
There have been no important events affecting the Company or any of its 
subsidiary undertakings since 31 December 2017.
Directors’ responsibilities statement 
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report and Accounts 
in accordance with applicable law and regulations.
Company law requires the Directors to prepare financial statements for each 
financial year. Accordingly, Directors are required to prepare the Group 
financial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting 
Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union and Article 4 of the IAS 
Regulation and have elected to prepare the Parent Company financial 
statements in accordance with FRS 101 (United Kingdom Accounting 
Standards and applicable law). In accordance with company law, the 
Directors must not approve the accounts unless they are satisfied that they 
give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Company and of the profit 
or loss of the Company for that period.
In preparing the Parent Company financial statements, the Directors are 
required to:
 – Select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently.
 – Make judgements and accounting estimates that are reasonable 
and prudent.
 – State whether applicable UK Accounting Standards have been followed, 
subject to any material departures disclosed and explained in the 
financial statements.
 – Prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is 
inappropriate to presume that the Company will continue in business.
In preparing the Group financial statements, International Accounting 
Standard 1 requires that Directors:
 – Properly select and apply accounting policies.
 – Present information, including accounting policies, in a manner that 
provides relevant, reliable, comparable and understandable information.
 – Provide additional disclosures when compliance with the specific 
requirements in IFRSs are insufficient to enable users to understand the 
impact of particular transactions, other events and conditions on the 
entity’s financial position and financial performance.
 – Make an assessment of the Company’s ability to continue as a 
going concern.
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that 
are sufficient to show and explain the Company’s transactions and disclose 
with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the Company 
and enable them to ensure that the financial statements comply with the 
Companies Act 2006. They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets 
of the Company and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and 
detection of fraud and other irregularities.
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the 
corporate and financial information included on the Company’s website. 
Legislation in the United Kingdom governing the preparation and 
dissemination of financial statements may differ from legislation in 
other jurisdictions.
In accordance with Provision C.1 of the Code, the Directors are required, inter 
alia, to ensure that the Annual Report and Accounts provides the information 
necessary for shareholders to assess the Company’s performance, business 
model and strategy. Details of how this was addressed are set out in the Audit 
Committee Report on page 66.
Responsibility statement
The Directors confirm that to the best of their knowledge:
The financial statements, prepared in accordance with the relevant financial 
reporting framework, give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial 
position and profit or loss of the Company and the undertakings included in 
the consolidation taken as a whole.
The Strategic Report includes a fair review of the development and 
performance of the business and the position of the Company and the 
undertakings included in the consolidation taken as a whole, together with a 
description of the principal risks and uncertainties that they face.
The Annual Report and Accounts, taken as a whole, are fair, balanced and 
understandable and provide the information necessary for shareholders to 
assess the Company’s performance, business model and strategy.
This Report of the Directors was approved by the Board of Directors on 
27 February 2018.

Taylor Wimpey plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 
Opinion on financial statements of Taylor Wimpey plc 
In our opinion:  
– the financial statements give a true and fair view of the state of the 
Group’s and of the Parent Company’s affairs as at 31 December 2017 
and of the Group’s profit for the year then ended; 
– the Group financial statements have been properly prepared in 
accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs)  
as adopted by the European Union and IFRSs as issued by the 
International Accounting Standards Board (IASB); 
– the Parent Company financial statements have been properly prepared 
in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting 
Practice including Financial Reporting Standard 101 “Reduced 
Disclosure Framework”; and 
– the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the 
requirements of the Companies Act 2006 and, as regards the Group 
financial statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation. 
We have audited the financial statements of Taylor Wimpey plc  
(the ‘Parent Company’) and its subsidiaries (the ‘Group’) which comprise: 
– the Consolidated Income Statement; 
– the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income; 
– the Consolidated and Parent Company Balance Sheets; 
– the Consolidated and Parent Company Statements of Changes  
in Equity; 
– the Consolidated Cash Flow Statement; and 
– the related Notes 1 to 32 of the Consolidated Financial Statements and 
Notes 1 to 15 of the Parent Company Financial Statements. 
The financial reporting framework that has been applied in the preparation 
of the Group Financial Statements is applicable law and IFRSs as adopted 
by the European Union. The financial reporting framework that has been 
applied in the preparation of the Parent Company Financial Statements  
is applicable law and United Kingdom Accounting Standards, including  
FRS 101 “Reduced Disclosure Framework” (United Kingdom Generally 
Accepted Accounting Practice). 
Basis for opinion 
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on 
Auditing (UK) (ISAs (UK)) and applicable law. Our responsibilities under 
those standards are further described in the auditor’s responsibilities for  
the audit of the financial statements section of our report.  
We are independent of the Group and the Parent Company in accordance 
with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the financial 
statements in the UK, including the FRC’s Ethical Standard as applied to 
listed public interest entities, and we have fulfilled our other ethical 
responsibilities in accordance with these requirements. We confirm  
that the non-audit services prohibited by the FRC’s Ethical Standard  
were not provided to the Group or the parent company. 
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and 
appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. 
Summary of our audit approach 
Key Audit 
Matters 
The key audit matters that we identified in the current year were:
– inventory costing and margin recognition; 
– defined benefit pension scheme accounting; and 
–  accounting for the leasehold provision 
Within this report, any new key audit matters are identified with 
 and any key audit matters which are the same as the prior 
year identified with . 
Materiality 
The materiality that we used for the Group Financial Statements 
was £40.0 million which was determined on the basis of 5% of 
pre-tax profit for the year, excluding exceptional items. 
Scoping 
Based on our scoping assessment, our Group audit is 
focused on the UK Housing division (excluding joint ventures) 
which represents the principal segment within the Group and 
accounts for 98% of the Group’s net operating assets, 98% 
of the Group’s revenue and 97% of the Group’s pre-tax 
profit before exceptional income. 
Significant 
changes in 
our approach
In relation to the key audit matters, we have added the 
accounting for the leasehold provision due to the material  
nature of this provision and the judgement required in  
estimating the liability.  
We no longer include the net realisable value of inventory as a 
key audit matter. Over recent years the provision has reduced 
significantly, both in value and in the number of sites it relates  
to. Furthermore, the improvement in the macro-economic 
environment since the financial crisis and the strength of the 
housing market have reduced the risk of this balance being 
materiality misstated. 
There have been no significant changes in our approach  
to scoping the audit and in determining materiality. 
Conclusions relating to principal risks, going concern and 
viability statement 
We have reviewed the Directors’ statement regarding the appropriateness 
of the going concern basis of accounting contained within Note 1 to the 
financial statements and the Directors’ statement on the longer-term  
viability of the Group contained within the strategic report, on page 41. 
We are required to state whether we have anything material to add or  
draw attention to in relation to: 
– the disclosures on pages 36-41 that describe the principal risks and 
explain how they are being managed or mitigated; 
– the Directors’ confirmation on pages 41 and 66 that they have carried 
out a robust assessment of the principal risks facing the Group, 
including those that would threaten its business model, future 
performance, solvency or liquidity; 
– the Directors’ statement in Note 1 to the financial statements about 
whether they considered it appropriate to adopt the going concern basis 
of accounting in preparing them and th eir identification of any material 
uncertainties to the Group and the Parent Company’s ability  
to continue to do so over a period of at least twelve months from the 
date of approval of the financial statements; 
– the Directors’ explanation on page 41 as to how they have assessed the 
prospects of the Group, over what period they have done so and why 
they consider that period to be appropriate, and their statement as to 
whether they have a reasonable expectation that the Group will be able 
to continue in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due over the 
period of their assessment, including any related disclosures drawing 
attention to any necessary qualifications or assumptions; or 
– whether the Directors’ statements relating to going concern and the 
prospects of the Company required in accordance with Listing Rule 
9.8.6R(3) are materially inconsistent with our knowledge obtained in  
the audit. 
We confirm that we have nothing material to add or draw attention to in 
respect of these matters. 
We agreed with the Directors’ adoption of the going concern basis  
of accounting and we did not identify any such material uncertainties. 
However, because not all future events or conditions can be predicted,  
this statement is not a guarantee as to the Group’s ability to continue  
as a going concern. 
Key audit matters 
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement, 
were of most significance in our audit of the financial statements of the 
current period and include the most significant assessed risks of material 
misstatement (whether or not due to fraud) that we identified. These matters 
included those which had the greatest effect on: the overall audit strategy, 
the allocation of resources in the audit and directing the efforts of the 
engagement team. 
These matters were addressed in the co ntext of our audit of the financial 
statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not 
provide a separate opinion on these matters. 
For each key audit matter we perform procedures to assess the design and 
implementation of key controls in mitigating the risk that the associated 
balances are misstated.

We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and 
appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. 
Summary of our audit approach 
Key Audit 
Matters 
The key audit matters that we identified in the current year were:
– inventory costing and margin recognition; 
– defined benefit pension scheme accounting; and 
–  accounting for the leasehold provision 
Within this report, any new key audit matters are identified with 
 and any key audit matters which are the same as the prior 
year identified with . 
Materiality 
The materiality that we used for the Group Financial Statements 
was £40.0 million which was determined on the basis of 5% of 
pre-tax profit for the year, excluding exceptional items. 
Scoping 
Based on our scoping assessment, our Group audit is 
focused on the UK Housing division (excluding joint ventures) 
which represents the principal segment within the Group and 
accounts for 98% of the Group’s net operating assets, 98% 
of the Group’s revenue and 97% of the Group’s pre-tax 
profit before exceptional income. 
Significant 
changes in 
our approach
In relation to the key audit matters, we have added the 
accounting for the leasehold provision due to the material  
nature of this provision and the judgement required in  
estimating the liability.  
We no longer include the net realisable value of inventory as a 
key audit matter. Over recent years the provision has reduced 
significantly, both in value and in the number of sites it relates  
to. Furthermore, the improvement in the macro-economic 
environment since the financial crisis and the strength of the 
housing market have reduced the risk of this balance being 
materiality misstated. 
There have been no significant changes in our approach  
to scoping the audit and in determining materiality. 
Conclusions relating to principal risks, going concern and 
viability statement 
We have reviewed the Directors’ statement regarding the appropriateness 
of the going concern basis of accounting contained within Note 1 to the 
financial statements and the Directors’ statement on the longer-term  
viability of the Group contained within the strategic report, on page 41. 
We are required to state whether we have anything material to add or  
draw attention to in relation to: 
– the disclosures on pages 36-41 that describe the principal risks and 
explain how they are being managed or mitigated; 
– the Directors’ confirmation on pages 41 and 66 that they have carried 
out a robust assessment of the principal risks facing the Group, 
including those that would threaten its business model, future 
performance, solvency or liquidity; 
– the Directors’ statement in Note 1 to the financial statements about 
whether they considered it appropriate to adopt the going concern basis 
of accounting in preparing them and th eir identification of any material 
uncertainties to the Group and the Parent Company’s ability  
to continue to do so over a period of at least twelve months from the 
date of approval of the financial statements; 
– the Directors’ explanation on page 41 as to how they have assessed the 
prospects of the Group, over what period they have done so and why 
they consider that period to be appropriate, and their statement as to 
whether they have a reasonable expectation that the Group will be able 
to continue in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due over the 
period of their assessment, including any related disclosures drawing 
attention to any necessary qualifications or assumptions; or 
– whether the Directors’ statements relating to going concern and the 
prospects of the Company required in accordance with Listing Rule 
9.8.6R(3) are materially inconsistent with our knowledge obtained in  
the audit. 
We confirm that we have nothing material to add or draw attention to in 
respect of these matters. 
We agreed with the Directors’ adoption of the going concern basis  
of accounting and we did not identify any such material uncertainties. 
However, because not all future events or conditions can be predicted,  
this statement is not a guarantee as to the Group’s ability to continue  
as a going concern. 
Key audit matters 
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement, 
were of most significance in our audit of the financial statements of the 
current period and include the most significant assessed risks of material 
misstatement (whether or not due to fraud) that we identified. These matters 
included those which had the greatest effect on: the overall audit strategy, 
the allocation of resources in the audit and directing the efforts of the 
engagement team. 
These matters were addressed in the co ntext of our audit of the financial 
statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not 
provide a separate opinion on these matters. 
For each key audit matter we perform procedures to assess the design and 
implementation of key controls in mitigating the risk that the associated 
balances are misstated.

Key audit 
matter 
description 
 
 
The value for inventory as at 31 December 2017 is £4,075.7 million (2016: £3,984.0 million) and as such is the most significant asset on the 
Balance Sheet (page 105). Inventory comprises land and work in progress (‘WIP’); WIP is made up of the construction cost of developing a site, 
and is transferred to cost of sales as each legal completion takes place. 
The Group’s cost allocation framework determines the profit forecast ed for each site, and acts as a method of allocating land a nd build cost of a 
development to each individual plot, ensuring the forecast margin to be achieved on each individual plot is equal across the de velopment. This 
cost allocation framework drives the recognition of costs as each plot is sold. We consider the appropriate margin recognition across the life of 
the site to be a key audit matter. 
There is significant judgement and a risk of potential fraud in the following areas: 
– estimating the selling price and build costs included within the initial site budget. This is due to the inherent judgement relating  
to external factors such as future selling prices, th e availability of mortgages and build cost inflation; 
– appropriately allocating costs such as shared infrastructure costs relating to a development so that the gross profit margin  
(in % terms) budgeted on each individual plot is equal; and 
– recording the variation when a deviation from the initial budget occurs and ensuring such variations are appropriately spread across the 
remainder of the development. 
These judgements impact the carrying value of inventory in the balance sheet and therefore the profit recognised on each plot s old. 
 
How the 
scope of  
our audit 
responded  
to the key 
audit matter 
 
 
We visited a number of the Group’s business units (as described on page 101). As part of these visits we assessed the design an d 
implementation, and tested the operating effectiveness of controls in relation to: 
– the preparation, approval and monitoring of site budgets; 
– the regular review meetings where Management reviews actual costs against detailed site budgets; and 
– the approval of journal transfers to allocate costs across sites or phases of a site’s development. 
We have also performed substantive testing as noted below: 
For a sample of sites we have analysed completions in the period and compared the achieved margin to the initial margin determi ned when the 
original site budget was approved. Where differences fell outsid e of an acceptable threshold, we performed corroborative inquir ies with 
Management and obtained evidence supporting the variance. 
For a further sample of sites tested, we have reviewed the tota l excesses and savings balance identified for each given site, a nd through 
recalculation of the expected income statement impact (based on the number of legal co mpletions in the year), we have determined that the 
excesses and savings have been appropriately allocated and recognised.  
Through the use of IT interrogation techniques, we have analysed journal postings being made to the inventory balances to highl ight any items 
which potentially should have been recorded as an expense. Addi tionally, we have tested WIP additions to the inventory balance to determine 
whether the costs have been appropriately capitalised, by tracing these through to supporting invoices. 
We have analysed cost per square foot of plots sold at a region al business unit level for the current year and compared this to cost per square 
foot in previous years, to analyse for any unusual tr ends which required corroboration from Management. 
We performed a review of sites where the initial site budget wa s created a number of years ago, which may indicate the use of a n outdated 
budget. Given the age of these sites, we challenged Management wh ere savings from the budget had been made or additional costs have not 
been recognised.  
  
Key 
observations 
 
 
Based on the procedures performed, we concluded that the Group’ s cost allocation framework appears reasonable for the intended purpose of 
recognising appropriate margins on plot completion. The accounting for cost allocation, both at the inception of a site and on an ongoing basis 
is in line with this framework.

Key audit 
matter 
description 
 
 
The total value of the defined benefit pension scheme at the balance sheet date is a net deficit of £63.7 million (2016: £233.0 million). The 
liabilities specifically are valued at £2,239.6 million (2016: £2,368.8 million). 
Accounting for a defined benefit pension scheme and the value of liabilities is dependent on significant assumptions, including an assessment of 
the discount rate, price inflation and key de mographic figures including life expectancy and mortality rates. A change in any of these 
assumptions could cause a material change in the value of the liabilities overall and the net pension liability on the Group’s balance sheet. 
These accounting judgements are inherently complex, require a high level of Management judgement and specialist actuarial input. 
The Group is obligated to pay contributions into the pension scheme to reduce the size of the to tal net deficit. There is judgement in assessing 
the nature and quantum of certain future contributions that may n eed to be made and, at the end of the scheme, whether the Grou p is entitled 
to any surplus that remains. These judgements directly impact the size of the future funding contributions and the size of the adjustment to 
recognise the future liabilities the Group has to the pension scheme (as shown in Note 20). 
How the 
scope of  
our audit 
responded  
to the key 
audit matter 
 
 
We assessed the competence and objectivity of the qualified actuary engaged by the Group to value the scheme’s defined benefits pension 
position under IAS 19 “Employee benefits”. 
We engaged our internal actuarial specialists to assess the appropriateness of the assumptions used to account for the defined benefit scheme. 
This included comparison of key data with market benchmarks an d to challenge the methodology used by the scheme actuary. We con sidered 
whether each of the key assumptions was reasonable in isolation and collectively in determining the pension liability at the ba lance sheet date. 
Furthermore, we have performed a sensitivity analysis on the key assumptions determined by the Directors. 
We reviewed the pension scheme documentation to determine the si ze and nature of the future funding contributions and to assess the 
treatment of any remaining surplus that may arise at the end of the scheme. We performe d procedures to assess the adjustment made in 
respect of future funding obligations. In doing so we reviewed the schedule of payments the Group is obligated to provide and c hecked  
whether the calculation was arithmetically correct.  
Key 
observations 
 
 
Based on the procedures performed, we concluded that the method ology and assumptions used in valuing the pension scheme liabilities are 
considered to be within an acceptable range.  
We concurred with the treatment and calculation of the future funding contributions of the Group.

Key audit

description 
 
 
As described in Note 6 at the AGM in April 2017 the Group completed their review in relation to certain historical lease structures. As a result of 
this review the Group provided £130.0 million in the first half of the year-ended 31 December 2017 for future costs in order to alter the terms of 
the current lease. The provision at 31 December 2017 stands at £127.6 million, the small reduction relating to costs incurred and payments 
made in the six month period. 
During the year, the Group has completed negotiations with the ma jority of freeholders and has agreed the framework under which payments 
can be made to change the current lease structures. 
Accounting for these provisions is complex and involves Management making a number of forward-looking estimates. The key judgem ents 
related to this key audit matter lie in es timating the final settlements with the stakeholders impacted by the historical lease structures. 
This provision has multiple components that relate to discussions with a number of parties including freeholders and individual customers.  
Within the provision are additional costs relating to the im plementation of the measures that have been identified.  
There are a number of risks associated with this provision:  
– Costs could be provided that the Group is not yet committed to incur, or obligated to pay, thereby inflating the provision. 
– For costs that are provided there is a risk th at these are inaccurately estimated or valued. 
 
How the 
scope of  
our audit 
responded  
to the key 
audit matter 
 
 
In addressing this risk, we have obtained Management’s estimati on of the total costs. For each component of the provision we ha ve performed 
procedures to assess, based on current facts and circumstance s, whether the estimates made by Management are reasonable. 
We have held discussions with legal counsel to ascertain whether Management’s model reflects the progress of negotiations that have been 
held with freeholders. 
The largest component of this calculation is the payments to be made to freeholders in order to alter the terms of the leases. In order to verify 
these amounts we have reviewed the status of negotiations with freeholders and, where these negotiations have been completed, obtained the 
agreements and recalculated the specific amounts that have been provided for.  
We have performed procedures to assess the completeness of the customers affected through an analysis of applications and verification to the 
underlying lease agreements. 
Key 
observations 
 
 
Based on the procedures performed, we considered the provision calculated by Management to be prudent. However, our estimate of any 
potential overstatement in the provision is below materiality and, if adjusted would not have increased the post-tax profit of the Group by a 
material amount at 31 December 2017.

 101 
 
 Taylor Wimpey plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 
Our application of materiality 
We define materiality as the magnitude of misstatement in the financial 
statements that makes it probable that the economic decisions of a 
reasonably knowledgeable person would be changed or influenced.  
We use materiality both in planning the scope of our audit work and  
in evaluating the results of our work.  
Based on our professional judgement, we determined materiality for  
the financial statements as a whole as follows: 
Group materiality £40.0 million (2016: £36.0 million) 
Basis for  
determining 
materiality 
5% (2016: 5%) of pre-tax profit for the year, 
excluding exceptional items, of £812.0 million 
(2016: £733.4 million) as described on page 103. 
The increase in materiality is directly attributable to 
the increase in pre-tax profit for the Group. 
Rationale for  
the benchmark 
applied 
Pre-tax profit, excluding exceptional items, has 
been chosen for the basis for materiality as this is 
the measure by which stakeholders and the 
market assess the wider performance of the entity. 
The exceptional items are excluded as they do not 
represent part of the underlying trading 
performance of the business. 
Parent Company 
materiality 
£38.0 million (2016: £34.2 million) 
Basis for  
determining 
materiality 
Approximately 1% (2016: approximately 1%) of net 
assets of £3,862.7 million (2016: £3,757.1 million). 
This is capped at 95% (2016: 95%) of Group 
materiality which we considered appropriate for the 
consolidation of this set of financial statements to 
the Group’s results. The increase in materiality is 
driven by the increase in Group materiality. 
Rationale for  
the benchmark 
applied 
Net assets is used as the benchmark as this entity 
is a Parent Company and not a trading entity.  
We use performance materiality to detect misstatements at a lower level of 
precision; for the current year this is se t at £28.0 million (2016: £25.2 million) 
for the Group and £26.6 million (2016: £25.1 million) for the Parent 
Company. This is lower than materiality and is used to determine the size of 
the samples that are selected for audit work and in forming the conclusions 
that we make during the course of our procedures.  
We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to the 
Committee all audit differences in excess of £1.5 million (2016: £1.0 million) 
for the Group and £1.5 million (2016: £1 .0 million) for the Parent Company, 
as well as differences below that th reshold that, in our view, warranted 
reporting on qualitative grounds. This increase in threshold is the result of an 
increase in the Group’s pre-tax profit du ring the year. We also report to the 
Audit Committee on disclosure matters that we identified when assessing 
the overall presentation of the financial statements. 
An overview of the scope of our audit  
Our Group audit was scoped by obtain ing an understanding of the Group 
and its environment, including Group-wide controls, and assessing the risks 
of material misstatement at the Group level. Based on that assessment, we 
focused our Group audit scope primarily on the UK Housing division 
(excluding joint ventures) which represents the principal segment within the 
Group and accounts for 98% (2016: 98%) of the Group’s net operating 
assets, 98% (2016: 97%) of the Grou p’s revenue and 97% (2016: 98%) of 
the Group’s pre-tax profit before exceptional income. Our audit work  
on the principal segment was executed at a lower level of materiality  
£38.0 million (2016: £34.2 million). 
We audit a number of the Group’s UK subsidiaries which are subject to 
audit at statutory materiality level, which in most cases is substantially lower 
than Group materiality. The statutory audits are finalised subsequent to the 
audit of the Group accounts.  
For the Spanish operations and material joint ventures desktop review 
procedures are conducted by the UK team.  
At the parent entity level we also tested the consolidation process and 
carried out analytical procedures to confirm our conclusion that there were 
no significant risks of material misstatement of the aggregated financial 
information of the remaining components not subject to audit or audit of 
specified account balances. 
The audit is performed centrally and includes all of the 24 regional business 
units within the Group’s UK housing division. We choose to visit a sample  
of these business units selected on a rotational basis and with reference to 
size and complexity among other factors. The purpose of these visits is to 
conduct procedures over selected controls that are in place at each 
business unit and also to perform substantive testing of certain balances.  
In the current year we performed regional visits to four (2016: four) 
locations. In addition we also visit other business units throughout the entity 
which are chosen on a random basis. During these visits we assess the 
commonality of the controls in line with the Group-wide controls identified, 
as well as performing substantive testing. This was performed at four  
(2016: five) locations. 
The Parent Company is located in the UK and audited directly by the  
Group audit team. 
Other information 
The Directors are responsible for the other information. The other 
information comprises the information included in the annual report other 
than the financial statements and our auditor’s report thereon. 
Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other 
information and, except to the extent otherwise explicitly stated in our 
report, we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon. 
In connection with our audit of the financial statements, our responsibility  
is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the  
other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements  
or our knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be 
materially misstated. 
If we identify such material inconsistencies or apparent material 
misstatements, we are required to determine whether there is a material 
misstatement in the financial statements or a material misstatement of the 
other information. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude 
that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are 
required to report that fact. 
In this context, matters that we are sp ecifically required to report to you as 
uncorrected material misstatements of the other information include where 
we conclude that: 
Fair, balanced and understandable – the statement given by the Directors 
that they consider the annual report and financial statements taken as a 
whole is fair, balanced and understandable and provides the information 
necessary for shareholders to assess the Group’s performance, business 
model and strategy, is materially inconsistent with our knowledge obtained 
in the audit; or 
Audit Committee reporting – the section describing the work of the Audit 
Committee does not appropriately address matters communicated by us  
to the Audit Committee; or 
Directors’ statement of compliance with the UK Corporate Governance 
Code – the parts of the Directors’ statement required under the Listing 
Rules relating to the Company’s compliance with the UK Corporate 
Governance Code containing provisions specified for review by the auditor 
in accordance with Listing Rule 9.8.10R(2) do not properly disclose a 
departure from a relevant provision of the UK Corporate Governance Code. 
We have nothing to report in respect of these matters. 
Responsibilities of Directors 
As explained more fully in the Directors’ responsibilities statement, the 
Directors are responsible for the preparation of the financial statements and 
for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view, and for such internal 
control as the Directors determine is necessary to enable the preparation  
of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether 
due to fraud or error.

Independent Auditor’s Report continued 
Taylor Wimpey plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 
In preparing the financial statements, the Directors are responsible for 
assessing the Group’s and the Parent Company’s ability to continue as a 
going concern, disclosing as applicable, matters related to going concern 
and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the Directors either 
intend to liquidate the Group or the Parent Company or to cease 
operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so. 
Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial 
statements 
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the 
financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, 
whether due to fraud or error, and to is sue an auditor’s report that includes 
our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a 
guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs (UK) will always 
detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from 
fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, 
they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of 
users taken on the basis of these financial statements. 
A further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the financial 
statements is located on the Financial Reporting Council’s website at: 
www.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities. This description forms part of  
our auditor’s report. 
Use of our report 
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body, in 
accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006. Our 
audit work has been undertaken so th at we might state to the Company’s 
members those matters we are required to state to them in an auditor’s 
report and for no other purpose. To th e fullest extent permitted by law, we 
do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the Company 
and the Company’s members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, 
or for the opinions we have formed. 
Report on other legal and regulatory requirements 
Opinions on other matters prescribed by the Companies  
Act 2006 
In our opinion the part of the Director s’ remuneration report to be audited 
has been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 2006. 
In our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of the audit: 
– the information given in the strategic report and the Directors’ report  
for the financial year for which the financial statements are prepared  
is consistent with the financial statements; and 
– the strategic report and the Directors’ report have been prepared in 
accordance with applicable legal requirements. 
In the light of the knowledge and understanding of the Group and of the 
Parent Company and their environment obtained in the course of the audit, 
we have not identified any material misstatements in the strategic report or 
the Directors’ report. 
Matters on which we are required to report by exception 
Adequacy of explanations received and accounting records

– adequate accounting records have not been kept by the parent 
company, or returns adequate for our audit have not been received  
from branches not visited by us; or 
– the Parent Company financial statements are not in agreement with  
the accounting records and returns. 
We have nothing to report in respect of these matters.

Auditor tenure 
Following the recommendation of the Audit Committee, we were appointed 
by the shareholders of Taylor Wimpey plc on 27 April 2017 to audit the

Following the merger of Taylor Woodrow and George Wimpey, we were

Financial Statements 
Independent Auditor’s Report continued 
Taylor Wimpey plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 
In preparing the financial statements, the Directors are responsible for 
assessing the Group’s and the Parent Company’s ability to continue as a 
going concern, disclosing as applicable, matters related to going concern 
and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the Directors either 
intend to liquidate the Group or the Parent Company or to cease 
operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so. 
Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial 
statements 
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the 
financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, 
whether due to fraud or error, and to is sue an auditor’s report that includes 
our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a 
guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs (UK) will always 
detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from 
fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, 
they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of 
users taken on the basis of these financial statements. 
A further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the financial 
statements is located on the Financial Reporting Council’s website at: 
www.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities. This description forms part of  
our auditor’s report. 
Use of our report 
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body, in 
accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006. Our 
audit work has been undertaken so th at we might state to the Company’s 
members those matters we are required to state to them in an auditor’s 
report and for no other purpose. To th e fullest extent permitted by law, we 
do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the Company 
and the Company’s members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, 
or for the opinions we have formed. 
Report on other legal and regulatory requirements 
Opinions on other matters prescribed by the Companies  
Act 2006 
In our opinion the part of the Director s’ remuneration report to be audited 
has been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 2006. 
In our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of the audit: 
– the information given in the strategic report and the Directors’ report  
for the financial year for which the financial statements are prepared  
is consistent with the financial statements; and 
– the strategic report and the Directors’ report have been prepared in 
accordance with applicable legal requirements. 
In the light of the knowledge and understanding of the Group and of the 
Parent Company and their environment obtained in the course of the audit, 
we have not identified any material misstatements in the strategic report or 
the Directors’ report. 
Matters on which we are required to report by exception 
Adequacy of explanations received and accounting records 
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if,  
in our opinion: 
– we have not received all the information and explanations we require  
for our audit; or 
– adequate accounting records have not been kept by the parent 
company, or returns adequate for our audit have not been received  
from branches not visited by us; or 
– the Parent Company financial statements are not in agreement with  
the accounting records and returns. 
We have nothing to report in respect of these matters. 
Directors’ remuneration 
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are also required to report if in our 
opinion certain disclosures of Directors’ remuneration have not been made 
or the part of the Directors’ remuneration report to be audited is not in 
agreement with the accounting records and returns. 
We have nothing to report in respect of these matters.

Financial Statements 
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 
Taylor Wimpey plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 
1. Significant accounting policies 
Basis of preparation 
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going 
concern basis and under the historical cost convention except as otherwise 
stated below. 
The principal accounting policies adopted, which have been applied 
consistently, except as otherwise stated, are set out below. 
Going concern 
The Group has prepared forecasts, including certain sensitivities taking into 
account the principal risks identified on pages 36 to 41. Having considered 
these forecasts, the Directors remain of the view that the Group’s financing 
arrangements and capital structure provide both the necessary facilities and 
covenant headroom to enable the Group to conduct its business for at least 
the next 12 months. 
Accordingly, the consolidated financial statements have been prepared on  
a going concern basis. 
Basis of accounting 
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance 
with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). The financial 
statements have also been prepared in accordance with IFRS as endorsed 
by the European Union and therefore the Group financial statements 
comply with Article 4 of the EU IAS Regulation. 
Basis of consolidation 
The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements 
of the Company and entities controlled by the Company (its subsidiaries) 
made up to 31 December each year. Control is achieved where the 
Company: 
– has the power over the investee; 
– is exposed, or has rights, to variable return from its involvement with  
the investee; and 
– has the ability to use its power to affect its returns. 
On acquisition, the assets and liabilities and contingent liabilities of a 
subsidiary are measured at their fair value at the date of acquisition. Any 
excess of the cost of acquisition over the fair value of the identifiable net 
assets acquired is recognised as goodwill. Any deficiency of the cost of 
acquisition below the fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired  
(i.e. discount on acquisition) is credited to the income statement in the 
period of acquisition. The interest of non-controlling shareholders is stated 
at the non-controlling interest’s proportion of the fair value of the assets and 
liabilities recognised. Subsequently, all comprehensive income is attributed 
to the owners and the non-controlling interests, which may result in the 
non-controlling interest having a debit balance.  
The results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the year are 
included in the consolidated income statement from the effective date  
of acquisition or up to the effective date of disposal, as appropriate.  
Where a subsidiary is disposed of which constituted a major line of 
business, it is disclosed as a discontinued operation. Where necessary, 
adjustments are made to the financial statements of subsidiaries to bring 
the accounting policies used into line with those used by the Group.  
All intra-Group transactions, balances, income and expenses are  
eliminated on consolidation. 
Joint ventures 
Undertakings are deemed to be a joint venture when the Group has joint 
control of the rights and assets of the undertaking via either voting rights or 
a formal agreement which includes that unanimous consent is required for 
strategic, financial and operating decisions. Joint ventures are consolidated 
under the equity accounting method. On transfer of land and/or work in 
progress to joint ventures, the Group recognises only its share of any profits 
or losses.  
Joint operations arise where the Group has joint control of an operation,  
but has rights to only its own assets and obligations related to the 
operation. These assets and obligations, and the Group’s share of  
revenues and costs, are included in the Group’s results. 
Joint ventures and joint operations are entered into to develop specific  
sites. Each arrangement is site or project specific and once the 
development or project is complete the arrangement is wound down.  
Segmental reporting 
The Group operates in two countries, being the United Kingdom and Spain. 
The United Kingdom is split into three geographical operating segments, 
each managed by a Divisional Chairman who sits on the Group 
Management Team. In addition, there is an operating segment covering  
the Corporate functions, Major Developments and Strategic Land. 
As such the segmental reporting for 2017 is: 
– Housing United Kingdom: 
− North 
− Central and South West 
− London and South East (including Central London) 
− Corporate 
– Housing Spain 
Revenue 
Revenue comprises the fair value of the consideration received or 
receivable, net of value added tax, rebates and discounts and after 
eliminating sales within the Group. Revenue and profit are recognised  
as follows: 
(a) Private housing development properties and land sales  
Revenue is recognised in the income statement when the significant  
risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred to the purchaser. 
Revenue in respect of the sale of residential properties, whether under the 
Government’s Help to Buy Scheme or not, is recognised at the fair value  
of the consideration received or receivable on legal completion.  
(b) Part exchange 
In certain instances, property may be accepted in part consideration for a 
sale of a residential property. The fair value is established by independent 
surveyors, reduced for costs to sell. Net proceeds generated from the 
subsequent sale of part exchange properties are recorded as a reduction  
to cost of sales. The original sale is recorded in the normal way, with the  
fair value of the exchanged property replacing cash receipts. 
(c)  Cash incentives 
Cash incentives are considered to be a discount from the purchase  
price offered to the acquirer and are therefore accounted for as a reduction 
to revenue. 
(d) Contracting work and partnership housing contracts  
Where the outcome of a long term contract can be estimated reliably, 
revenue and costs are recognised by reference to the stage of completion 
of the contract activity at the balance sheet date. This is normally measured 
by surveys of work performed to date. Variations in contract work, claims 
and incentive payments are included to the extent that it is probable that 
they will result in revenue and they are capable of being reliably measured. 
Where the outcome of a long term contract cannot be estimated reliably, 
contract revenue that is probable will be recovered is recognised to the 
extent of contract costs incurred. Contract costs are recognised as 
expenses in the period in which they are incurred. When it is probable  
that total contract costs will exceed total contract revenue, the expected 
loss is recognised as an expense immediately.

Financial Statements 
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 
Taylor Wimpey plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 
1. Significant accounting policies 
Basis of preparation 
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going 
concern basis and under the historical cost convention except as otherwise 
stated below. 
The principal accounting policies adopted, which have been applied 
consistently, except as otherwise stated, are set out below. 
Going concern 
The Group has prepared forecasts, including certain sensitivities taking into 
account the principal risks identified on pages 36 to 41. Having considered 
these forecasts, the Directors remain of the view that the Group’s financing 
arrangements and capital structure provide both the necessary facilities and 
covenant headroom to enable the Group to conduct its business for at least 
the next 12 months. 
Accordingly, the consolidated financial statements have been prepared on  
a going concern basis. 
Basis of accounting 
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance 
with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). The financial 
statements have also been prepared in accordance with IFRS as endorsed 
by the European Union and therefore the Group financial statements 
comply with Article 4 of the EU IAS Regulation. 
Basis of consolidation 
The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements 
of the Company and entities controlled by the Company (its subsidiaries) 
made up to 31 December each year. Control is achieved where the 
Company: 
– has the power over the investee; 
– is exposed, or has rights, to variable return from its involvement with  
the investee; and 
– has the ability to use its power to affect its returns. 
On acquisition, the assets and liabilities and contingent liabilities of a 
subsidiary are measured at their fair value at the date of acquisition. Any 
excess of the cost of acquisition over the fair value of the identifiable net 
assets acquired is recognised as goodwill. Any deficiency of the cost of 
acquisition below the fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired  
(i.e. discount on acquisition) is credited to the income statement in the 
period of acquisition. The interest of non-controlling shareholders is stated 
at the non-controlling interest’s proportion of the fair value of the assets and 
liabilities recognised. Subsequently, all comprehensive income is attributed 
to the owners and the non-controlling interests, which may result in the 
non-controlling interest having a debit balance.  
The results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the year are 
included in the consolidated income statement from the effective date  
of acquisition or up to the effective date of disposal, as appropriate.  
Where a subsidiary is disposed of which constituted a major line of 
business, it is disclosed as a discontinued operation. Where necessary, 
adjustments are made to the financial statements of subsidiaries to bring 
the accounting policies used into line with those used by the Group.  
All intra-Group transactions, balances, income and expenses are  
eliminated on consolidation. 
Joint ventures 
Undertakings are deemed to be a joint venture when the Group has joint 
control of the rights and assets of the undertaking via either voting rights or 
a formal agreement which includes that unanimous consent is required for 
strategic, financial and operating decisions. Joint ventures are consolidated 
under the equity accounting method. On transfer of land and/or work in 
progress to joint ventures, the Group recognises only its share of any profits 
or losses.  
Joint operations arise where the Group has joint control of an operation,  
but has rights to only its own assets and obligations related to the 
operation. These assets and obligations, and the Group’s share of  
revenues and costs, are included in the Group’s results. 
Joint ventures and joint operations are entered into to develop specific  
sites. Each arrangement is site or project specific and once the 
development or project is complete the arrangement is wound down.  
Segmental reporting 
The Group operates in two countries, being the United Kingdom and Spain. 
The United Kingdom is split into three geographical operating segments, 
each managed by a Divisional Chairman who sits on the Group 
Management Team. In addition, there is an operating segment covering  
the Corporate functions, Major Developments and Strategic Land. 
As such the segmental reporting for 2017 is: 
– Housing United Kingdom: 
− North 
− Central and South West 
− London and South East (including Central London) 
− Corporate 
– Housing Spain 
Revenue 
Revenue comprises the fair value of the consideration received or 
receivable, net of value added tax, rebates and discounts and after 
eliminating sales within the Group. Revenue and profit are recognised  
as follows: 
(a) Private housing development properties and land sales  
Revenue is recognised in the income statement when the significant  
risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred to the purchaser. 
Revenue in respect of the sale of residential properties, whether under the 
Government’s Help to Buy Scheme or not, is recognised at the fair value  
of the consideration received or receivable on legal completion.  
(b) Part exchange 
In certain instances, property may be accepted in part consideration for a 
sale of a residential property. The fair value is established by independent 
surveyors, reduced for costs to sell. Net proceeds generated from the 
subsequent sale of part exchange properties are recorded as a reduction  
to cost of sales. The original sale is recorded in the normal way, with the  
fair value of the exchanged property replacing cash receipts. 
(c)  Cash incentives 
Cash incentives are considered to be a discount from the purchase  
price offered to the acquirer and are therefore accounted for as a reduction 
to revenue. 
(d) Contracting work and partnership housing contracts  
Where the outcome of a long term contract can be estimated reliably, 
revenue and costs are recognised by reference to the stage of completion 
of the contract activity at the balance sheet date. This is normally measured 
by surveys of work performed to date. Variations in contract work, claims 
and incentive payments are included to the extent that it is probable that 
they will result in revenue and they are capable of being reliably measured. 
Where the outcome of a long term contract cannot be estimated reliably, 
contract revenue that is probable will be recovered is recognised to the 
extent of contract costs incurred. Contract costs are recognised as 
expenses in the period in which they are incurred. When it is probable  
that total contract costs will exceed total contract revenue, the expected 
loss is recognised as an expense immediately.

 Taylor Wimpey plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 
1. Significant accounting policies continued 
Cost of sales 
The Group determines the value of inventory charged to cost of sales based 
on the total budgeted cost of developing a site. Once the total expected 
costs of development are established they are allocated to individual plots 
to achieve a standard build cost per plot. 
To the extent that additional costs or savings are identified as the site 
progresses, these are recognised over the remaining plots unless they  
are specific to a particular plot, in wh ich case they are recognised in the 
income statement at the point of sale. 
Positive contribution 
The positive contribution presented on the face of the income statement 
represents the net amount of previous impairments allocated to inventory 
on a plot that has subsequently result ed in a gross profit on completion. 
This is due to the combination of selling prices and costs, or product mix 
improvements exceeding our market assumptions in the previous net 
realisable value (NRV) exercise. These amounts are stated before the 
allocation of overheads which are excluded from the Group’s NRV exercise. 
Exceptional items 
Exceptional items are defined as items of income or expenditure which,  
in the opinion of the Directors, are mate rial or unusual in nature or of such 
significance that they require separate disclosure on the face of the income 
statement in accordance with IAS 1 ‘Presentation of Financial Statements’. 
Should these items be reversed disclosure of this would also be as 
exceptional items.  
Interest receivable 
Interest income on bank deposits is recognised on an accruals basis.  
Also included in interest receivable are interest and interest-related 
payments the Group receives on other receivables.  
Borrowing costs 
Borrowing costs are recognised on an accruals basis and are payable  
on the Group’s borrowings. Also included in borrowing costs is the 
amortisation of fees associated with the arrangement of the financing.  
Finance charges, including premiums payable on settlement or redemption, 
and direct issue costs, are accounted for on an accruals basis in the 
income statement using the effective interest method and are added to  
the carrying amount of the instrument to the extent that they are not settled 
in the period in which they arise. 
Capitalised finance costs are held in other receivables and amortised over 
the period of the facility. 
Foreign currencies 
The individual financial statements of each Group company are presented  
in the currency of the primary economic environment in which it operates 
(its functional currency). Transactions in currencies other than the functional 
currency are recorded at the rates of exchange prevailing on the dates of 
the transactions. At each balance sheet date, monetary assets and liabilities 
that are denominated in foreign currencies other than the functional 
currency are retranslated at the rates prevailing at the balance sheet date.  
Non-monetary assets and liabilities carried at fair value that are 
denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the rates prevailing at 
the date when the fair value was determined. Gains and losses arising on 
retranslation are included in the net profit or loss for the period. 
On consolidation, the assets and liabilities of the Group’s overseas 
operation are translated at exchange rates prevailing at the balance sheet 
date. Income and expense items are tr anslated at an appropriate average 
rate for the year. Exchange differences arising are recognised within other 
comprehensive income and transferred to the Group’s translation reserve. 
Such translation differences are recognised as income or expenses in the 
income statement in the period in which the operation is disposed of. 
Goodwill and fair value adjustments aris ing on the acquisition of a foreign 
entity are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign entity and translated at 
the closing rate. The Group uses foreign currency borrowings to hedge its net 
investment exposure to certain overseas subsidiaries (see page 110 for details 
of the Group’s accounting policies in respect of such financial instruments). 
Operating leases 
Rentals payable under operating leases are charged to the income 
statement on a straight-line basis over the term of the relevant lease. 
Benefits received and receivable (and costs paid and payable) as an 
incentive to enter into an operating lease are also spread on a  
straight-line basis over the lease term. 
Intangible assets 
Brands 
Internally generated brands are not capitalised. Acquired brands are 
capitalised. Their values are calculated based on the Group’s valuation 
methodology, which is based on valuations of discounted cash flows. 
Brands are stated at cost, less accumulated amortisation and any 
accumulated impairment losses. 
Software development costs  
Costs that are directly associated with the acquisition or production of 
identifiable and unique software controlled by the Group, and that generate 
economic benefits beyond one year, are recognised as intangible assets. 
Computer software development costs recognised as assets are  
amortised on a straight-line basis over three to five years from the time  
of implementation, and are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation 
and any accumulated impairment losses. 
Property, plant and equipment 
Land and buildings held for use in th e production or supply of goods or 
services, or for administrative purposes, are stated in the balance sheet  
at cost less accumulated depreciation and any accumulated impairment 
losses. Freehold land is not depreciated. Buildings are depreciated over  
50 years. 
Plant and equipment is stated at cost less depreciation.  
Depreciation is charged so as to expense the cost or valuation of assets 
over their estimated useful lives. Other assets are depreciated using the 
straight-line method, on the following bases: 
– Plant and equipment 20-25% per annum 
– Computer equipment 33% per annum 
– Leasehold improvements over the term of the lease 
The gain or loss arising on the dispos al or retirement of an asset is 
determined as the difference between the sale proceeds, less any  
selling expenses, and the carrying amount of the asset. This difference  
is recognised in the income statement.  
Impairment of tangible and intangible assets  
At each balance sheet date, the Group reviews the carrying amounts of its 
tangible and intangible assets to determine whether there is any indication 
that those assets have suffered an impairment loss. If any such indication 
exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in order to 
determine the extent of the impairment loss (if any). Where the asset does 
not generate cash flows that are independent from other assets, the Group 
estimates the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to which the 
asset belongs.

Taylor Wimpey plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 
1. Significant accounting policies continued 
Impairment of tangible and intangible assets continued 
The recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and 
value in use. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows  
are discounted to their present value, using a pre-tax discount rate that 
reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the 
risks specific to the asset for which the estimates of future cash flows  
have not been adjusted. 
If the recoverable amount of an asset is estimated to be less than its 
carrying amount, the carrying amount of the asset is reduced to its 
recoverable amount. If the recoverable amount of a cash-generating  
unit is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, impairment losses  
are allocated first to the intangible assets in the cash-generating unit. 
If the full impairment of intangible assets is not sufficient to reduce the 
carrying value of the cash-generating unit to its recoverable amount, 
tangible fixed assets must then be impaired. If the recoverable amount of 
tangible fixed assets exceeds their carrying value, no further impairment is 
required. An impairment loss is recognised as an expense immediately.  
Where an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount  
of the asset or cash-generating unit is increased to the revised estimate  
of its recoverable amount, but so that the increased carrying amount  
does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined 
had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset or cash-generating 
unit in prior years. A reversal of an impairment loss is recognised as  
income immediately. 
Financial instruments 
Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised on the Group’s 
balance sheet when the Group becomes a party to the contractual 
provisions of the instrument. 
Trade receivables and other receivables 
Trade receivables on normal terms excluding derivative financial instruments 
do not carry any interest and are stat ed at their nominal value as reduced 
by appropriate allowances for estimated unrecoverable amounts. Trade 
receivables on extended terms, particularly in respect of land, are measured 
at amortised cost using the effective interest method, less any impairment. 
Interest income is recognised by applying the effective interest rate. 
Derivative financial instruments are measured at fair value.  
Mortgage receivables 
Mortgage receivables relate to sales incentives including shared equity 
loans. The receivable is recorded at amortised cost.  
Shared equity loans are separated into a loan receivable and a non-closely 
related embedded derivative asset for accounting purposes as allowed 
under IAS 39 ‘Financial instruments’. The loan is measured at amortised 
cost and the embedded derivative is measured at fair value through profit  
or loss with any subsequent impairment charged through profit and loss. 
The fair value of the derivative is based on a national house price index. 
Cash and cash equivalents 
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash held by the Group and  
short term bank deposits with an original maturity of three months or less 
from inception and are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value. 
Cash and cash equivalents are classified as ‘loans and receivables’.  
Further disclosures relating to financial assets are set out in Note 19. 
Financial liabilities and equity instruments  
Financial liabilities and equity instruments are classified according to  
the substance of the contractual arrangements entered into. An equity 
instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets  
of the Group after deducting all of its liabilities. Equity instruments issued  
by the Parent Company are recorded as the proceeds are received, net  
of direct issue costs. 
Borrowings 
Interest-bearing bank loans and overdrafts are recorded as the proceeds 
are received, net of direct issue costs.  
Trade payables 
Trade payables on normal terms are not interest-bearing and are stated  
at their nominal value. Trade payables on extended terms, particularly in 
respect of land, are recorded at their fa ir value at the date of acquisition of 
the asset to which they relate. The discount to nominal value is amortised 
over the period of the credit term and charged to finance costs. 
Derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting  
The Group uses foreign currency borrowings and derivatives to hedge its 
net investment exposure to movements in exchange rates on translation of 
certain individual financial statements denominated in foreign currencies 
other than Sterling which is the functional currency of the Parent Company. 
Derivative financial instruments are measured at fair value. Changes in the 
fair value of derivative financial instruments that are designated and effective 
as hedges of net investments in foreign operations are recognised directly  
in other comprehensive income and the ineffective portion, if any, is 
recognised immediately in the income statement.  
For an effective hedge of an exposure to changes in fair value, the hedged 
item is adjusted for changes in fair value attributable to the risk being 
hedged with the corresponding entry in the consolidated income statement. 
Gains or losses from re-measuring the derivative, or for non-derivatives the 
foreign currency component of its carrying amount, are also recognised in 
the income statement. 
Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments that do not 
qualify for hedge accounting are recognised in the income statement as 
they arise. 
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument expires  
or is sold, terminated, or exercised, or no longer qualifies for hedge 
accounting. At that time, any cumulative gain or loss on the hedging 
instrument recognised in other comprehensive income is retained in 
accumulated other comprehensive income until the forecasted transaction 
occurs. If a hedged transaction is no longer expected to occur, the net 
cumulative gain or loss recognised in accumulated other comprehensive 
income is transferred to the income st atement for the period. If a derivative 
financial instrument does not meet the specific criteria of IAS 39 ‘Financial 
instruments’ for hedge accounting it is presented as a held for trading asset 
or liability. 
Customer deposits 
Customer deposits are recorded as a liability within ‘other payables’  
on receipt and released to the in come statement as revenue upon  
legal completion. 
Provisions 
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation as  
a result of a past event, and it is prob able that the Group will be required  
to settle that obligation. Provisions are measured at the Directors’ best 
estimate of the expenditure required to settle the obligation at the balance 
sheet date and are discounted to presen t value where the effect is material.

Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments that do not 
qualify for hedge accounting are recognised in the income statement as 
they arise. 
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument expires  
or is sold, terminated, or exercised, or no longer qualifies for hedge 
accounting. At that time, any cumulative gain or loss on the hedging 
instrument recognised in other comprehensive income is retained in 
accumulated other comprehensive income until the forecasted transaction 
occurs. If a hedged transaction is no longer expected to occur, the net 
cumulative gain or loss recognised in accumulated other comprehensive

 Taylor Wimpey plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 
1. Significant accounting policies continued  
Inventories 
Inventories are initially stated at cost or at the fair value at acquisition  
date when acquired as part of a busi ness combination and then held at the 
lower of this initial amount and net realisable value. Costs comprise direct 
materials and, where applicable, direct labour and those overheads that 
have been incurred in bringing the in ventories to their present location and 
condition. Net realisable value represents the estimated selling price less all 
estimated costs of completion and costs to be incurred in marketing, selling 
and distribution. Land is recognised in inventory when the significant risks 
and rewards of ownership have been transferred to the Group. 
Non-refundable land option payments are initially recognised in inventory. 
They are reviewed regularly and written off to the income statement when  
it is probable that the option will not be exercised. 
Taxation 
The tax charge represents the sum of the tax currently payable and 
deferred tax. 
Current tax  
The tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the year. Taxable 
profit differs from profit before tax as reported in the income statement 
because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or 
deductible in other years and it fu rther excludes items that are never 
taxable or deductible. The Group’s liability for current tax is calculated 
using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the 
balance sheet date. 
Deferred tax  
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on 
differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in 
the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the 
computation of taxable profit, and is accounted for using the balance sheet 
liability method. Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable 
temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent 
that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which 
deductible temporary differences can be utilised. 
Such assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary difference 
arises from goodwill or from the initial recognition (other than in a business 
combination) of other assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects 
neither the tax profit nor the accounting profit. 
Deferred tax liabilities are also recognised for taxable temporary differences 
arising on investments in subsidiaries and interests in joint ventures, except 
where the Group is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference 
and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the 
foreseeable future. 
Deferred tax is measured on a non-discounted basis using the tax rates  
and laws that have then been enacted or substantively enacted by the 
balance sheet date.  
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance 
sheet date and reduced to the extent th at it is no longer probable that 
sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to  
be recovered. Deferred tax is charged or credited to the income statement, 
except when it relates to items char ged or credited directly to other 
comprehensive income or equity, in which case the deferred tax is also 
dealt with in other comprehensive income or equity.  
Share-based payments 
The Group has applied the requirements of IFRS 2 ‘Share-based  
payment’. The Group issues equity-settled share-based payments to 
certain employees. Equity-settled share-based payments are measured  
at fair value at the date of grant. The fair value is expensed on a  
straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on the Group’s  
estimate of shares that will eventually vest after adjusting for the  
effect of non-market vesting conditions. 
 
 
Employee benefits 
The Group accounts for pensions and similar benefits under IAS 19 
‘Employee benefits’ (amended 2014). In respect of defined benefit plans,  
a finance charge is determined on the net defined benefit pension liability. 
The operating and financing costs of such plans are recognised separately  
in the income statement; service cost s are spread systematically over the 
service period of employees, past service costs are recognised as an 
expense at the earlier of when the plan is amended or curtailment occurs,  
at the same time as which the entity will recognise related restructuring  
costs or termination benefits. Certain liability management costs and 
financing costs are recognised in the periods in which they arise.  
Actuarial gains and losses are recognised immediately in the statement  
of comprehensive income. 
The retirement benefit obligation recognised in the consolidated statement  
of financial position represents either the net liability (deficit) position of the 
scheme or, should the scheme be in an IAS 19 accounting surplus,  
the IFRIC 14 liability equal to the present value of future committed  
cash contributions. 
Payments to defined contribution schemes are charged as an expense  
as they fall due. 
2. Critical accounting judgements and key sources of 
estimation uncertainty 
Critical accounting judgements 
Management have not made any individual critical accounting judgements 
that are material to the Group, apar t from those estimations which are set 
out below. 
Key sources of estimation uncertainty 
Key sources of estimation uncertainty are those which present a significant 
risk of potential material misstatement to carrying amounts of assets or 
liabilities within the next financial year.  
Employee benefits 
The value of the defined benefit plan liabilities is determined by using various 
long term actuarial assumptions, including future rates of inflation, growth, 
yields, returns on investments and mortality rates. As actual changes in 
inflation, growth, yields and investment returns may differ from those 
assumed, this is a key source of esti mation uncertainty within the financial 
statements. Changes in these assumptions over time and differences to the 
actual outcome will be reflected in the statement of comprehensive income. 
Note 20 details the main assumptions in accounting for the Group’s defined 
benefit pension scheme along with sensitivities of the liabilities to changes in 
these assumptions.  
Other sources of estimation uncertainty 
Provision for Leasehold  
The value of this provision has been established using information  
available to management at 31 December 2017, together with a range  
of assumptions including the number of units which have been sold by

with whom the Group has not yet agreed a settlement.  
Cost allocation 
In order to determine the profit that the Group is able to recognise on  
its developments in a specific period, the Group has to allocate site-wide 
development costs between units built in the current year and in future 
years. It also has to estimate costs to complete on such developments,  
and make estimates relating to future sales price margins on those 
developments and units. In making these assessments there is a degree of 
inherent uncertainty. The Group has developed internal controls to assess 
and review carrying values and the appropriateness of estimates made.  112

Adoption of new and revised standards of interpretation 
In the current year, the Group has applied a number of amendments to 
IFRSs issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB)  
that are mandatorily effective for an accounting period that begins on or 
after 1 January 2017. Their adoption has not had any material impact on 
the disclosures or on the amounts reported in these financial statements.  
– IAS 7 ‘Statement of Cash flows’ (amendments) – Disclosure Initiative
– Annual Improvements to IFRSs 2014 – 2016 Cycle
New and revised IFRSs in issue but not yet effective 
At the date of authorisation of these financial statements, the Group has not 
applied the following new and revised IF RSs that have been issued but are 
not yet effective and in some cases had not yet been adopted by the EU: 
– IFRS 9 ‘Financial Instruments’
– IFRS 15 ‘Revenue from Contracts with Customers’
– IFRS 16 ‘Leases’
– IFRS 2 ‘Share-based Payment’ (amendments) – classification and
measurement of share-based payment transactions
– IFRS 10 ‘Consolidated Financial Statements’ and IAS 28 ‘Investments
in Associates’ (amendments) – sale or contribution of assets between 
an investor and its associate or joint venture
– Annual Improvements to IFRSs 2014 – 2016 Cycle 
The Directors do not expect that the ad option of the Standards listed above 
will have a material impact on the financial statements of the Group in future 
periods. Whilst not material the impact of standards being adopted from  
1 January 2018 is noted below: 
– IFRS 9 ‘Financial Instruments’ was issued in final form incorporating the
impairment, classification and measurement requirements in July 2014
and is scheduled to replace IAS 39 ‘Financial Instruments: Recognition
and Measurement’ from 1 January 2018. 
IFRS 9 will impact the classification, measurement, impairment and
de-recognition of financial instruments as well as introducing a new 
hedge accounting model. The main impact will be the reclassification 
of the shared equity portfolio, currently recognised as a debtor with a 
non-closely related embedded derivative.
Under IFRS 9 the shared equity port folio will be treated as Fair Value
through Profit and Loss. On restatement of 31 December 2017 results, 
this change will improve the Group’s operating profit margin by 10bps,
representing the notional interest previously unwound through finance
costs, which under IFRS 9 will be incorporated into the fair value
adjustment and so recognised through other income/expense.
The impairment requirements of the standard require the Group to
consider the expected lifetime losses on all financial assets. The Group 
does not have significant financial assets other than the shared equity
portfolio and as such the impact of IFRS 9 on other financial assets
is immaterial.
The requirements of the new hedge accounting model have been
reflected in the Group’s hedging strategy, policies and documentation
from 1 January 2018. 
– IFRS 15 ‘Revenue from Contracts with Customers’ was issued in
May 2014 and amended in September 2015. This standard will be
applicable to the Group from 1 January 2018. The standard sets out
requirements for revenue recognition from contracts with customers.
The standard uses a five-step model to apportion revenue to the
individual promises, or performance obligations, within a contract. 
The timing of revenue recognition and therefore number of units, on
some long-term contracts may be brought forward. The effect of these
changes on operating profit margin will be immaterial as the timing of 
revenue recognition for most of the Group’s long-term contracts will
not change on adoption of IFRS 15. 
The standard will require presentational changes to the consolidated 
income statement to show part exchange income and expenses 
separately below gross margin rather than on a net basis within cost  
of sales. Part exchange is not a significant element of the Group’s 
operations so as such, this impact will be negligible on gross profit 
margin and have no impact on operating profit margin.  
Introductory fees are currently deducted from revenue but under the 
new standard will be recognised in cost of sales. These fees are 
immaterial to the Group and will not impact operating profit margin.  
The above items will have no effect on the Group’s cash flows. 
– IFRS 16 ‘Leases’ was issued in January 2016, and although it is not
mandatory to adopt until 1 January 2019, the Group has elected to
adopt early, so will apply from 1 January 2018.
The standard specifies how leases are recognised, presented, measured
and disclosed.
On the consolidated statement of financial position, a right of use asset
and a corresponding lease liability must be recognised for both
operating and finance leases. In the income statement, the existing
operating lease charge which is currently recognised within operating 
profit, will be replaced by a depreciation charge in respect of the right of
use asset, and an interest cost in relation to the lease liability.
The Group’s lease commitments will be brought onto the consolidated
statement of financial position, as a liability with a corresponding asset 
valued using a Right of Use method. The value of lease commitments is
immaterial in relation to the net assets of the Group. This will impact the
timing of the recognition of lease costs within the income statement
although it will not affect the Group’s cash flows. Based on an analysis
of lease commitments held by the Group at 31 December 2017, and 
utilising estimated discount rates, the approximate net impact on profit in
the year is expected to be immaterial to the Group.
The composition of the Group’s lease commitments will change over 
time and the discount rates applied are required to be updated to reflect
the prevailing economic environment.

Leasehold provision 
As announced at the AGM on 27 April 2017, we are taking measures which we believe will address our customers’ concerns regarding historical lease 
structures in an appropriate and fair manne r. Our review has focused on a specific le ase structure which provides that the grou nd rent doubles every  
10 years until the 50th year, at which point the rent is capped. This lease structure was introduced by Taylor Wimpey in good f aith in 2007 and was one  
of a variety of lease types used on new developments during that period until late 2011, when we stopped using them on new deve lopments commenced 
after that date.  
The doubling clauses are considered to be entirely legal and are clearly set out in the relevant lease documentation. In additi on, when buying their  
Taylor Wimpey property, all customers received independent legal ad vice as part of the standard conveyancing process. In line w ith normal practice  
the relevant freehold reversions have been sold to a number of third parties over several years.  
We have made good progress in securing agreements with freehold ers covering approximately 90% of the properties affected by the doubling ground  
rent clauses. These agreements enable our customers with a ten-year doubling ground rent lease to convert to an RPI-based struc ture, should they elect 
to participate in our assistance scheme. The provision will be utilised as customer applications progress through the scheme.  
The exceptional provision of £130.0 million recognised at June 2017 was calculat ed using a range of assumptions including the t otal number of properties 
still owned by the original purchaser and an average valuation pe r leasehold unit. Following negotiations with freeholders, the valuation on the majority of 
units has been determined, but the total number of properties an d several other assumptions, could still vary over time. Howeve r, given the information 
available at 31 December 2017 it is consider ed that the original provision recognised of £130.0 million remains appropriate.  
We expect the cash outflow to be spread over a number of years; this will be determined by the timing of applications from cust omers.  
Inventory impairment 
The markets in our core geographies, which are the primary driver s of our business, continue to trade positively. However, we a re alert to the potential risk 
of a change in customer confidence given the on-going Brexit negotiations. 
At 31 December 2017, the Group completed a net realisable value a ssessment of inventory with these factors in mind. This review did not result in any net 
change to the total provision (2016: £8.2 million addition and £7 .7 million release) but resulted in a reallocation of £2.4 mil lion of historically booked provision 
between two sites which continue to hold a provision due to poor site location and complex site requirements. There was no furt her change to the 
provision because the majority of the remaining impairment provis ion is on sites which have suffered from adverse planning deci sions, or are impacted  
by other site-specific factors, rather than wider market factors.  
The Group undertakes a detailed review on a site by site basis of the net realisable value of its land and work in progress. Th e results from this review are 
sensitive to the assumptions used. Therefore, we also consider when the inventory is likely to be realised, and whether there h as been a sustained change 
in market conditions and the wider economic environment existing at the balance sheet date.  
At the balance sheet date, the Group held land and work in progre ss in the UK that had been written down to net realisable valu e of £69.9 million  
(2016: £119.6 million) with associated impairments of £46.9 m illion (2016: £96.8 million). As at 31 December 2017, 2% (31 Decem ber 2016: 3%) of  
our UK short term owned and controlled land is impaired. In the year 5% (2016: 5%) of the Group’s UK completions were from pre- 2009 impaired sites.  
There has been continued improvement in the Spanish housing market during the year . However, this improvement has been on newer sites which  
have been acquired in better locations. Sales rates and prices on sites which have been previously impaired remain low. In the year, 35 plots (2016: 65) 
were completed in Spain that had previously been impaired. At 31 December 2017 Spain ha d land and work in progress that had bee n written down to

Closing deferred tax on UK temporary differences has been calcul ated at the tax rates that are expected to apply for the period when the asset is realised 
or the liability is settled. Accordingly, the temporary differen ces have been calculated at rates between 19% and 17% (2016: 20 % and 17%).

The Group has not recognised temporary differences relating to tax losses carried forward and other temporary differences amoun ting to £2.8 million 
(2016: £3.0 million) in the UK and £58.0 mi llion (2016: £70.0 million) in Spain. The UK temporary differences have not been rec ognised as they are 
predominantly non-trading in nature and insufficient certainty exists as to their future utilisation. The temporary differences in Spain have not been 
recognised due to uncertainty of sufficient taxable profits in the future against which to utilise these amounts. 
At the balance sheet date, the Group has unus ed UK capital losses of £269.6 million (2016: £269.5 m illion). No deferred tax asset has been recognised  
in respect of the capital losses at 31 Dece mber 2017 because the Group does not believe that it is probable that these capital losses will be utilised in the 
foreseeable future.

The markets in our core geographies, which are the primary driver s of our business, continue to trade positively. However, we a re alert to the potential risk 
of a change in customer confidence given the on-going Brexit negotiations. At 31 December, the Group completed a net realisable value assessment of 
inventory with these factors in mind. This review did not result in any net change to the total provision (2016: £8.2 million a ddition and £7.7 million release) 
but in a reallocation of £2.4 million of historically booked provision between two sites which continue to hold a provision due to the poor site location and 
complex site requirements. There was no furt her change as the majority of the impairment provision remaining is on sites which have suffered from adverse 
planning decisions or are impacted by other site-specific factors rather than wider market factors.

Capital management  
The Group’s policy is to maintain a strong credit rating for the business and to have an appropriate funding structure. Shareho lders’ equity and long-term 
debt are used to finance property, plant and equipment and the medi um to long term inventories. Revolving credit facilities are used to fund net current 
assets including development and construction costs. The Group’s financing facilities contain the usual financial covenants inc luding minimum interest 
cover and maximum gearing. The Group met these requirements throughout the year.

other payables, as disclosed in Note 18, include £125.3 million (2016: £152.9 million) of non-financial liabilities.  
The Group has designated the carrying value of €54.0 million of foreign currency borrowings (2016: €54.0 million foreign curren cy borrowings) as a net 
investment hedge.  
The Group has no other financial instruments with fair values th at are determined by reference to significant unobservable inpu ts (level 3), nor have there 
been any transfers of assets or liabilities between levels of th e fair value hierarchy. There are no non-recurring fair value measurements. 
Forward contracts have been entered into to hedge transaction risks on intra-Group loans to buy/(sell) against Sterling: €65.0 million and C$ nil million 
(2016: €47.5 million and C$(0.4) million). The fair value of the forward contracts is not materially different to their book value as they were entered into  
on or near 31 December in each year and mature less than one month later, hence the value of the derivative is negligible. 
Market risk 
The Group’s activities expose it to the financial risks of changes in both foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. The Group aims to manage  
the exposure to these risks using fixed or variable rate borrowings, foreign currency borrowings and derivative financial instruments. 
(a) Interest rate risk management  
The Group can be exposed to interest rate risk as the Group borro ws funds, when required, at variable interest rates. The exposure to variable rate 
borrowings can fluctuate during the year due to the seasonal nature of cash flow s relating to housing sales and the less certai n timing of land payments. 
Group policy is to manage the volatility risk by a combination of fixed rate borrowings and interest rate swaps such that the sensitivity to potential changes 
in variable rates is within acceptable levels. Group policy does not allow the use of derivative s to speculate against changes to future interest rates and they 
are only used to manage exposure to volatilit y. This policy has not changed during the year. 
To measure the risk, variable rate borrowings and the expected in terest cost for the year are forecast monthly and compared to budget using 
management’s expectations of a reasonably possible change in interest rates. Interest expense volatility remained within acceptable limits throughout  
the year.  
Interest rate sensitivity 
The effect on both income and equity, based on exposure to non-derivative floating rate instruments at the balance sheet date, is shown in the table below. 
The Group does not currently have any outstanding interest rate derivatives. The 0.25% change represents a reasonably possible change in interest rates 
over the next financial period.

Market risk 
The Group’s activities expose it to the financial risks of changes in both foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. The Group aims to manage  
the exposure to these risks using fixed or variable rate borrowings, foreign currency borrowings and derivative financial instruments. 
(a) Interest rate risk management  
The Group can be exposed to interest rate risk as the Group borro ws funds, when required, at variable interest rates. The exposure to variable rate 
borrowings can fluctuate during the year due to the seasonal nature of cash flow s relating to housing sales and the less certai n timing of land payments.

in variable rates is within acceptable levels. Group policy does not allow the use of derivative s to speculate against changes to future interest rates and they

(b) Foreign currency risk management 
The Group’s overseas activities expose it to the financial risks of changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Its Spanish sub sidiary is the only foreign 
operation of the Group.  
The Group is not materially exposed to transaction risks as al l Group companies conduct their business in their respective functional currencies.  
Group policy requires that transaction risks are hedged to the functional currency of the subsidiary using foreign currency borrowings or derivatives  
where appropriate.  
The Group is also exposed to the translatio n risk from accounting for both the income and the net investment held in a functional currency other than 
Sterling. The net investment risk may be hedged using foreign cu rrency borrowings and derivatives. Assets and liabilities denominated in non-functional 
currencies are retranslated each month using th e latest exchange rates. Income is also measured monthly using the latest exchan ge rates and compared 
to a budget held at historical exchange rates. Other than th e natural hedge provided by foreign currency borrowings, the transl ation risk of income is not 
hedged using derivatives. The policy is kept under periodic review and has not changed during the year. 
Hedge accounting 
Hedging activities are evaluated periodically to ensure that they are in line with Group policy. During 2016 foreign currency b orrowings replaced forward 
contracts as the designated financial instrument to hedge the net investment risk in the Spanish operations.  
The Group has designated the carrying value of €54.0 million of foreign currency borrowings (2016: €54.0 million borrowings) held at the balance sheet 
date as a net investment hedge of part of the Group’s investment in Euro denominated assets.  
The change in the carrying amount of the derivatives which were effective hedging instruments, and the change in the carrying v alue of the borrowings, 
offset the exchange movement on the foreign currency net invest ments and are presented in the Statement of Other Comprehensive Income.  
Foreign currency sensitivity 
The Group is exposed to the Euro due to its Spanish operations. The following table details how the Group’s income and equity w ould increase/(decrease)  
on a before tax basis following a 15% change in the currency’s value against Sterling, and in accordance with IFRS 7, all other variables remaining constant.  
The 15% change represents a reasonably possible change in the specified Euro exchange rates in relation to Sterling.

Credit risk 
Credit risk is the risk of financial loss where counte rparties are not able to meet their obligations.  
Group policy is that surplus cash, when no t used to repay borrowings, is placed on de posit with the Group’s main relationship b anks and with other banks  
or money market funds based on a minimum credit rating and maximum exposure. There is no significant concentration of risk to a ny single counterparty. 
Land receivables arise from sales of surplus land on deferred term s. A policy is in place such th at, if the credit risk is not acceptable, then the deferred 
payment must have adequate security, either by the use of an appropriate guarantee or a charge over the land. The fair value of any land held as security  
is considered by management to be sufficient in relation to the carrying amount of the receivable to which it relates. 
Trade and other receivables comprise mainly amounts receivable from various housing as sociations and other house builders. Management consider  
that the credit quality of the various recei vables is good in respect of the amounts outstanding and therefore credit risk is considered to be low. There is  
no significant concentration of risk.  
Mortgage receivables, including shared equity loans, are in connection with the various historical promotion schemes to support sales on a selective basis. 
The mortgages are secured by a second charge over the property and are held at amortised cost. The non-closely related embedded derivative related to 
shared equity is held at fair value. 
The carrying amount of financial assets, as detailed above, repres ents the Group’s maximum exposure to credit risk at the reporting date assuming that 
any security held has no value.

Liquidity risk 
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group does not have sufficient financial resources available to meet its obligations as the y fall due. The Group manages 
liquidity risk by continuously monitoring forecast and actual cash flows, matching the expected cash flow timings of financial assets and liabilities with  
the use of cash and cash equivalents, borro wings, overdrafts and committed revolving credit facilities with a minimum of 12 months to maturity. Future 
borrowing requirements are forecast on a monthly basis and funding headroom is maintain ed above forecast peak requirements to m eet unforeseen 
events. The Group’s borrowings and facilities have a range of ma turities with an average life of 2.6 years (2016: 3.6 years). I n February 2018, the Group 
agreed with its banks, to amend the terms of its £550 million facility on more favourable terms and to extend the maturity date to February 2023.  
The Group’s borrowings and facilities now have an average life of 5.2 years. 
In addition to fixed term borrowings, the Group has access to co mmitted revolving credit facilities and cash balances. At the balance sheet date, the  
total unused committed amount was £550.0 million (2016: £550.0 mi llion) and cash and cash equivalents were £600.5 million (2016 : £450.2 million). 
The maturity profile of the anticipated future cash flows, including interest using the latest applicable relevant rate based o n the earliest date on which  
the Group can be required to pay financial liabiliti es on an undiscounted basis, is as follows:

20. Retirement benefit obligations 
Retirement benefit obligations comprise a defined benefit pensio n liability of £63.7 million (2016: £232.7 million) and a post-retirement healthcare liability  
of £1.1 million (2016: £1.4 million). 
The Group operates the Taylor Wimpey Pension Scheme (TWPS), a de fined benefit pension scheme, which is closed to both new membe rs and to  
future accrual. The Group also operates defi ned contribution pension arrangements in the UK, which are available to new and exi sting UK employees. 
Defined contribution pension plan 
A defined contribution plan is a pension plan under which the Gr oup pays contributions to an independently administered fund – such contributions  
are based upon a fixed percentage of employees’ pay. The Group ha s no legal or constructive obligations to pay further contribu tions to the fund once  
the contributions have been paid. Members’ benefits are determined by the amount of contributions paid by the Group and the mem ber, together with 
investment returns earned on the contributions arising from the performance of each in dividual’s chosen investments and the type of pension the member 
chooses to buy at retirement. As a result, actuarial risk (that be nefits will be lower than expected) and investment risk (that assets invested in will not 
perform in line with expectations) fall on the employee.  
The contributions are recognised as an employee benefit expense when they are due. Prepaid contributions are recognised as an a sset to the extent  
that a cash refund or a reduction in the future payments is available. 
The Group’s defined contribution plan, the Taylor Wimpey Personal Choice Plan (TWPCP), is offered to all new and existing monthly paid employees.  
The People’s Pension is used for auto enrolment purposes for weekly and monthly paid employees not participating in the TWPCP. The People’s Pension 
is provided by B&CE, one of the UK’s largest providers of financial benefits to construction industry employers and individuals . 
The Group made contributions to its defined contribution arrangem ents of £10.4 million in 2017 (2016: £10.6 million), which is included in the income 
statement charge. The Group expects to make contributions of around £10.6 million in 2018. 
Defined benefit pension schemes 
The Group’s defined benefit pension scheme in the UK is the TWPS . The TWPS is a funded defined benefit pension scheme which pro vides benefits to 
beneficiaries in the form of a guaranteed level of pension payable for life. The level of benefits provided depends on members’ length of service and their 
salary in the final years leading up to retirement or date of ceasing active accrual if earlier. Pension payments are generally increased in line with inflation.   127

20. Retirement benefit obligations continued 
The Scheme was formed by the merger of the Taylor Woodrow Group Pension and Life Assurance Fund and the George Wimpey Staff Pen sion Scheme  
in 2013. The Scheme is closed to new members and future accrual. 
The Group operates the TWPS under the UK regulatory framework. Be nefits are paid to members from a Trustee-administered fund an d the Trustee is 
responsible for ensuring that the Scheme is sufficiently funded to meet current and future benefit payments. Scheme assets are held in trust.  
The TWPS Trustee’s other duties include managing the investment of scheme assets, administration of scheme benefits and exercis ing of discretionary 
powers. The Group works closely with the Trustee to manage the TWPS. The Trustee of the TWPS owes fiduciary duties to the TWPS’ beneficiaries.  
The appointment of the Directors to the Trustee Board is determined by the TWPS trust documentation.  
During 2017 we engaged with the Pension Trus tee on the triennial valuation of the pension scheme with a reference date of 31 De cember 2016. The table 
below sets out the key assumptions agreed as part of this valuation. 
Assumptions  
Discount rate (pre-retirement) 4.20%
Discount rate (post-retirement) 2.35%
RPI inflation 3.50%
CPI inflation 2.70%
Mortality 100% of S2PXA tables, CMI_2016 improvements with 1.50% trend rate and a smoothing 
factor of 7.5 
The result of this valuation is a Technica l Provisions deficit at 31 December 2016 of £222.0 million. Strong investment returns on the Scheme’s assets over 
2017 have reduced this deficit to approxim ately £30.0 million at 31 December 2017.  
A revised funding plan, based on the results of the triennial valu ation, has been agreed since the Balance Sheet date. This pla n commits the Group to cash 
contributions of £47.1 million per annum for four years, includ ing £5.1 million per annum from the Pension Funding Partnership (as described below) and 
£2.0 million per annum to cover scheme expenses. However, £40 million per annum of cash contributions are only required whilst the Scheme remains in  
a Technical Provisions deficit position. Should the Scheme become fully funded, then these cash contributions will be suspended until such time that the 
Scheme’s Technical Provision funding level falls to below 96%.  
During 2017, as part of the triennial valuation, each of the as sumptions were reviewed, with a focus on demographic assumptions. In order to review the 
mortality base table assumption for the Scheme, three different in vestigations were carried out. Firstly, the Scheme Actuary of the TWPS analysed actual 
mortality experience for the Scheme over the period from 2014 to 2016 inclusive. Secondly the Company commissioned a postcode mortality analysis of 
the Scheme population from an independent actuary. Finally, the Company, in collaboration with the Trustee, commissioned a review to assess the current 
health of existing scheme members through questionnaires and telephone interviews. This approach, referred to as a Medically Un derwritten Mortality 
Study (“MUMS”), allowed for more detailed investigation of the h ealth profile of the Scheme, and has been adopted for other pen sion schemes in recent 
years. The Company and Trustee wrote to appr oximately 3,200 members aged between 55 and 80 who together covered 45% of overall scheme liabilities. 
Of these members, approximately 60% responded to the survey. The responses were then analysed by experienced medical underwriters to translate 
them into loadings to be applied to standard mortality base ta bles. The results of the MUMS investigation, the postcode analysis and the scheme specific 
experience analysis were then ‘blended’ to form an overall mortality assumption. This blending applied different weightings to each study for each  
sub-Group of scheme members, reflecting the perceived relevance of each study to each sub-Group.  
This resulted in an overall loading to be applied to the S2P ba se tables of 107% for the IAS 19 accounting valuation, and resulted in a reduction in life 
expectancy of around 0.5 years to 1 year relative to the mo rtality base table assumption adopted in the previous year. 
The revised, scheme specific, mortality assumption resulted in a reduction in the deficit (before IFRIC 14 adjustment) of appro ximately £60 million which, 
combined with asset outperformance has resulted in an IAS 19 acc ounting surplus of £23.9 million. The terms of the Scheme are s uch that the Group 
does not have an unconditional right to a refund of surplus. As a result, the Group has recognised an adjustment to this surplus of £87.6 million, resulting in 
an IFRIC 14 deficit of £63.7 million, which represents the pres ent value of future contributions under the current 2013 funding plan.  
In 2013, the Group introduced a £100.0 million Pension Funding Part nership utilising show homes, as well as seven offices which are owned, in a sale  
and leaseback structure. This provides an additional £5.1 million of annual funding for the TWPS. The assets held within this s cheme do not affect the  
IAS 19 figures as they remain assets of the Group, and are not assets of the TWPS. As at 31 December 2017, there was £101.5 mil lion of property and 
£9.5 million of cash held within the structure (2016: £101.4 millio n of property and £9.6 million of cash). The terms of this F unding Partnership are such  
that, should the Scheme be in a Technical Provisions deficit at 2028, then a bullet payment will be due equal to the lower of £ 100.0 million or the Technical 
Provisions deficit. The IFRIC 14 deficit at 31 December 2017 does not include any value in respect of this bullet payment as mo delling undertaken by an 
independent actuary indicates that the Scheme is expected to be fully funded by 2028 and therefore no bullet payment is expecte d to be required. 
The Group continues to work closely with the Trustee in managing pension risks, including management of interest rate, inflatio n and longevity risks.  
The Scheme assets are approximately 80% hedged against changes in both interest rates and inflation expectations on the Scheme’ s long-term,  
‘self-sufficiency’ basis. The Scheme also benefits from a bulk annuity contract which covers some of the largest liabilities in the Scheme, providing 
protection against interest rate, inflation and longevity risk.

The defined benefit obligation is measured us ing the projected unit actuarial cost method. 
The duration, or average term to payment fo r the benefits due, weighted by liability, is approximately 16 years for the TWPS. 
Accounting assumptions 
The assumptions used in calculating the accounting costs and obligations of the TWPS, as detailed below, are set by the Directo rs after consultation with 
independent, professionally qualified actuaries. The basis for th ese assumptions is prescribed by IAS 19 and they do not reflec t the assumptions that may 
be used in future funding valuations of the TWPS.  
The discount rate used to determine the present value of the obligations is set by reference to market yields on high-quality c orporate bonds with regard  
for the duration of the TWPS. The assumption for RPI inflation is set by reference to the Bank of England’s implied inflation curve with regard for the 
duration of the TWPS, with appropriate adjustments to reflect di stortions due to supply and demand for inflation-linked securit ies. CPI inflation is set  
by reference to RPI inflation as no CPI-linked bonds exist to render implied CPI inflation directly observable. 
The life expectancies have been derived us ing mortality assumptions that were based on the results of a Medically Underwritten Mortality Study conducted 
by the Group during 2017, combined with experience data. Using th e results from this study the mortality assumption is based on 107% of S2PXA tables, 
CMI_2016 improvements with a 1.25% trend rate and smoothing factor of 7.5. The base ta bles used in 2016 were the S2NXA tables w ith CMI_2015 
improvements and 1.25% trend rate, including actual 2013 to 2015 death data.

20. Retirement benefit obligations continued  
Risks and risk management 
The TWPS, in common with the majority of such defined benefit pension schemes in the UK, has a number of areas of risk. These a reas of risk, and the 
ways in which the Group has sought to manage them, are set out in the table below. 
The risks are considered from both a fundin g perspective, which drives the cash commitments of the Group, and from an accountin g perspective,  
i.e. the extent to which such risks affect the am ounts recorded in the Group’s financial statements. 
Although investment decisions in the UK are the responsibility of the Trustees, the Group takes an active interest to ensure th at the pension scheme  
risks are managed efficiently. The Group has regular meetings with the Trustees to discuss investment performance, regulatory changes and proposals  
to actively manage the position of the Scheme.  
Risk Description 
Asset volatility Building on the implementation of the Scheme’s Strategic Asset Allocation review in 2016, the Trustee agreed to two new allocat ions  
in 2017. The first, a new allocation of US$145 million (c. £110 million) was approved in October 2017 to the KKR Private Credit 
Opportunities Partners ll fund, an illiquid credit mandate. The allocation will provide a high return with sufficient liquidity remaining across 
the rest of the portfolio given that existing illiquid allocations are expected to fall in the near future as the mangers (Ares , M&G and 
Highbridge) return more capital. As this fund is a drawdown-type structure, the Scheme will be investing over time, the first capital call 
occurred in February 2018. The investment will be funded from ex cess collateral within the liability-hedging portfolio and the Scheme’s 
remaining holdings in investment grade corporate bonds.  
In November 2017, the Trustee agreed to di versify their Diversified Risk Premia (“DRP”) allocation between two managers, disinv esting 
half of the current DRP allocation with AQR, and allocating this to the Bridgewater Optimal fund. This transition occurred on  
1 February 2018 and will lead to greater diversif ication and reduced manager concentration risk.  
In addition to the investments outlined above, the Scheme’s strategy is well diversified through its exposure to a range of ass et classes, 
including protected equities, commercial real estate debt, direct loans, hedge funds, government bonds and a broad spectrum of 
corporate bonds and other fixed income exposures. 
The Scheme does not target a specific asset allocation but instead bases its strategic asset allocation on the return objectives and risk 
constraints agreed upon by the Trustees. 
Changes in 
bond yields 
Falling bond yields tend to increase the funding and accounting liabilities. However, the investment in bond and liability-matc hing 
derivatives offers a degree of matching, i.e. the movement in as sets arising from changes in bond yields partially matches the movement 
in the funding or accounting liabilities. In this way, the exposure to move ments in bond yields is reduced. 
Investing  
in foreign 
currency 
In order to maintain appropriate diversification of investments wi thin the Scheme’s assets and to take advantage of overseas in vestment 
returns, a proportion of the underlying investment portfolio is invested overseas. To balance the risk of investing in foreign currencies 
while having an obligation to settle benefits in Sterling, a currency hedging programme, using forward foreign exchange contrac ts,  
has been put in place to reduce the currency exposure of these overseas investments to the targeted level. 
Asset/liability 
mismatch 
In order to manage the Scheme’s economic exposure to interest rates and inflation rates, a liability-hedging programme has been put  
in place. Derivatives are being used to hedge changes in the Scheme’s funding level from changes in its liabilities in an unfun ded way, 
substantially reducing asset/liability mismatch risk. 
Illiquidity Insurance policies, real estate and illiquid debt (which include commercial real estate debt and direct lending bonds) make up  
£366 million (16%) of the asset portfolio of the Scheme. Excludin g these amounts, approximately 76% of assets are managed eithe r in 
segregated accounts or daily/weekly dealt pooled funds and can th erefore be realised within a few business days under normal ma rket 
conditions. Of the remaining investments, a further 19% are in pooled funds with monthly redemption dates. The remainder of 5% could 
be redeemed within approximately three months of notification in normal market conditions. 
Life expectancy The majority of the TWPS’ obligations are to provide a pension for the life of the member on retirement, so increases in life expectancy 
will result in an increase in the TWPS’ liabilities. The inflation-linked nature of the majority of benefit payments from the T WPS increases 
the sensitivity of the liabilities to changes in life expectancy. During 2014, the Group reached agreement with Partnership Life Assurance 
Company Limited to insure the benefits of 10% of members with the greatest anticipated liabilities through a medically underwritten  
buy-in. By insuring these members, the Group has removed more than 10% of risk from the scheme by significantly reducing the 
longevity of a large proportion of the liabilities.

29. Share-based payments continued 
For share plans with no market conditions granted during the current and preceding year , the fair value of the awards at the gr ant date was determined 
using the Binomial model. The inputs into that model were as follows: 
 2017 2016
Weighted average share price £1.94 £1.63
Weighted average exercise price £0.98 £0.83
Expected volatility 36% 38%
Expected life 3/5 years 3/5 years
Risk free rate 0.6% 0.1%
Expected dividend yield 2.02% 1.81%
The weighted average fair value of share awards granted during the year is £1.10 (2016: £0.95). 
Expected volatility was determined by calculating the historical volatility of the Group’s share price over the expected term. 
For share awards with market conditions granted during the current year, the fair value of the awards was determined using the Monte Carlo simulation 
model. The inputs into that model were as follows: 
 2017 2016
Weighted average share price £1.86 £1.76
Weighted average exercise price Nil Nil
Expected volatility 38% 31%
Expected life 0.8/3 years 0.8/3 years
Risk free rate 0.1% 0.4%
Expected dividend yield 0.0% 0.0%
The weighted average fair value of share options granted during the year is £1.21 (2016: £0.92). 
Expected volatility was determined by calculating the historical volatility of the Group’s share price over the expected term. The expected life used in the 
model is based on historical exercise patterns. 
The Group recognised a total expense of £11.5 million related to equity-settled share-based payment transactions in 2017 (2016: £9.8 million).

Since the Balance Sheet date, the pensions 2016 triennial valuation has been completed and a new funding plan agreed. The trien nial valuation (technical) 
deficit was £222 million at the reference da te of 31 December 2016, although this defi cit reduced to c.£30 million by 31 Decemb er 2017. This plan 
commits the Group to cash contributions of £47.1 million per a nnum (2016: £23.1 million per annum), including £5.1 million per annum from the Pension 
Funding Partnership and £2.0 million per annum to cover scheme expenses. However, £40.0 million per annum of cash contributions are only required 
whilst the scheme remains in a Technical Provisions deficit whic h will be tested quarterly. Once the scheme is fully funded, th ese cash contributions will be 
suspended until such time that the Scheme’s Technical Provision funding level falls to below 96%.  
In February 2018, the Group agreed with its banks, to amend the terms of its £550 million facility on more favourable terms and to extend the maturity date 
to February 2023.

Notes to the Company Financial Statem ents for the year to 31 December 2017 
Taylor Wimpey plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 
1. Significant accounting policies 
The following accounting policies have been used consistently, unless 
otherwise stated, in dealing with items which are considered material. 
Basis of preparation 
The Company meets the definition of a qualifying entity under FRS 101 
(Financial Reporting Standard 101) issued by the Financial Reporting 
Council. Accordingly, these financial statements were prepared in 
accordance with FRS 101 ‘Reduced Disclosure Framework’ as issued  
by the Financial Reporting Council. 
As permitted by FRS 101, the Company has taken advantage of the 
disclosure exemptions available under that standard in relation to  
share-based payments, financial instruments, capital management, 
presentation of comparative information in respect of certain assets, 
presentation of a cash flow statement, standards not yet effective, 
impairment of assets and related party transactions. 
The principal accounting policies adopted are set out below. 
Going concern 
The Group has prepared forecasts, including certain sensitivities taking into 
account the principal risks identified on pages 36 to 41. Having considered 
these forecasts, the Directors remain of the view that the Group’s financing 
arrangements and capital structure provide both the necessary facilities and 
covenant headroom to enable the Group to conduct its business for at least 
the next 12 months. 
Accordingly, the Company financial statements have been prepared on a 
going concern basis. 
Investments in Group undertakings 
Investments are included in the balance sheet at cost less any provision for 
impairment. The Company assesses investments for impairment whenever 
events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an 
investment may not be recoverable. If any such indication of impairment 
exists, the Company makes an estimate of the recoverable amount of  
the investment. If the recoverable amount is less than the value of the 
investment, the investment is considered to be impaired and is written 
down to its recoverable amount. An impairment loss is expensed 
immediately; if the impairment is not considered to be a permanent 
diminution in value, it may reverse in a future period to the extent it is  
no longer considered necessary.  
The Company values its investments in subsidiary holding companies 
based on a comparison between the net assets recoverable by  
the subsidiary company and the investment held. Where the net  
assets are lower than the investment an impairment is recorded.  
For trading subsidiaries, the investment carrying value in the Company  
is assessed against the net present value of the discounted cash flows  
from the subsidiary. 
Borrowing costs 
Capitalised finance costs are held in other receivables and amortised  
over the period of the facility.  
Taxation 
The tax charge represents the sum of the tax currently payable and 
deferred tax. 
Current tax 
The tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the year. Taxable 
profit differs from profit before tax because it excludes items of income or 
expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes 
items that are never taxable or deductible.  
The Company’s liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that  
have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.  
Any liability or credit in respect of Gr oup relief in lieu of current tax is  
also calculated using corporation tax rates that have been enacted or 
substantively enacted by the balance sheet date unless a different rate 
(including a nil rate) has been agreed within the Group. 
Deferred tax 
Deferred tax is provided in full on temporary differences that result in an 
obligation at the balance sheet date to pay more tax, or a right to pay less 
tax, at a future date, at rates expected to apply when they crystallise based 
on current tax rates and law.  
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is regarded as more 
likely than not that they will be recovered. 
Deferred tax is measured on a non-discounted basis using the tax rates 
and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance 
sheet date. 
Foreign currencies 
Transactions denominated in foreign currencies are recorded in Sterling at 
actual rates as of the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities 
denominated in foreign currencies at the year end are reported at the rates 
of exchange prevailing at the year end.  
Any gain or loss arising from a change in exchange rates after the date of 
the transaction is included as an exchange gain or loss in profit and loss. 
Unrealised exchange differences on intercompany long term loans and 
foreign currency borrowings, to the extent that they hedge the Company’s 
investment in overseas investments, are taken to the translation reserve. 
Derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting  
The Company uses foreign currency borrowings to hedge its investment  
in overseas operations. Changes in the fair value of derivative financial 
instruments that are designated and effective as hedges of investment in 
overseas operations are recognised directly in other comprehensive income 
and the ineffective portion, if any, is recognised immediately in the income 
statement. The hedged items are adjusted for changes in exchange rates, 
with gains or losses from re-measuring the carrying amount being 
recognised directly in other comprehensive income.  
Share-based payments 
The Company issues equity-settled share-based payments to certain 
employees of its subsidiaries. Equity-settled share-based payments are 
measured at fair value at the grant date. The fair value is expensed on a 
straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on the estimate of shares 
that will eventually vest. The cost of equity-settled share-based payments 
granted to employees of subsidiary companies is borne by the employing 
company, without recharge. As such the Company’s investment in the 
subsidiary is increased by an equivalent amount.

Investments in Group undertakings 
Investments are included in the balance sheet at cost less any provision for 
impairment. The Company assesses investments for impairment whenever 
events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an 
investment may not be recoverable. If any such indication of impairment 
exists, the Company makes an estimate of the recoverable amount of  
the investment. If the recoverable amount is less than the value of the 
investment, the investment is considered to be impaired and is written 
down to its recoverable amount. An impairment loss is expensed 
immediately; if the impairment is not considered to be a permanent 
diminution in value, it may reverse in a future period to the extent it is  
no longer considered necessary.  
The Company values its investments in subsidiary holding companies 
based on a comparison between the net assets recoverable by  
the subsidiary company and the investment held. Where the net  
assets are lower than the investment an impairment is recorded.  
For trading subsidiaries, the investment carrying value in the Company  
is assessed against the net present value of the discounted cash flows  
from the subsidiary. 
Borrowing costs 
Capitalised finance costs are held in other receivables and amortised  
over the period of the facility.  
Taxation 
The tax charge represents the sum of the tax currently payable and 
deferred tax. 
Current tax 
The tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the year. Taxable 
profit differs from profit before tax because it excludes items of income or 
expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes 
items that are never taxable or deductible.  
The Company’s liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that  
have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.  
Any liability or credit in respect of Gr oup relief in lieu of current tax is  
also calculated using corporation tax rates that have been enacted or 
substantively enacted by the balance sheet date unless a different rate 
(including a nil rate) has been agreed within the Group. 
Deferred tax 
Deferred tax is provided in full on temporary differences that result in an 
obligation at the balance sheet date to pay more tax, or a right to pay less 
tax, at a future date, at rates expected to apply when they crystallise based 
on current tax rates and law.  
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is regarded as more 
likely than not that they will be recovered. 
Deferred tax is measured on a non-discounted basis using the tax rates 
and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance 
sheet date. 
Foreign currencies 
Transactions denominated in foreign currencies are recorded in Sterling at 
actual rates as of the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities 
denominated in foreign currencies at the year end are reported at the rates 
of exchange prevailing at the year end.  
Any gain or loss arising from a change in exchange rates after the date of 
the transaction is included as an exchange gain or loss in profit and loss. 
Unrealised exchange differences on intercompany long term loans and 
foreign currency borrowings, to the extent that they hedge the Company’s 
investment in overseas investments, are taken to the translation reserve. 
Derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting  
The Company uses foreign currency borrowings to hedge its investment  
in overseas operations. Changes in the fair value of derivative financial 
instruments that are designated and effective as hedges of investment in 
overseas operations are recognised directly in other comprehensive income 
and the ineffective portion, if any, is recognised immediately in the income 
statement. The hedged items are adjusted for changes in exchange rates, 
with gains or losses from re-measuring the carrying amount being 
recognised directly in other comprehensive income.  
Share-based payments 
The Company issues equity-settled share-based payments to certain 
employees of its subsidiaries. Equity-settled share-based payments are 
measured at fair value at the grant date. The fair value is expensed on a 
straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on the estimate of shares 
that will eventually vest. The cost of equity-settled share-based payments 
granted to employees of subsidiary companies is borne by the employing 
company, without recharge. As such the Company’s investment in the 
subsidiary is increased by an equivalent amount.

the purpose of the determination by the Company of the votes which 
shareholders may cast), shareholders must be registered in the Register 
of Members of the Company by 6:00pm on 24 April 2018 (or, in the event 
of any adjournment, on the date which is two days before the time of the 
adjourned meeting). Shareholders then on the Register of Members shall 
be entitled to attend and vote at the Annual General Meeting in respect of

entries on the relevant Register of Members after that deadline shall be 
disregarded in determining the rights of any person to attend and vote at 
the Annual General Meeting.

of 3,276,276,755 ordinary shares, carrying one vote each. Therefore,

3. If you are a shareholder of the Company at the time and date set out in 
Note 1 above, you are entitled to appoint a proxy to exercise all or any of 
your rights to attend and to speak and vote on your behalf at the Meeting. 
Shareholders may appoint more than one proxy in relation to the Annual 
General Meeting provided that each proxy is appointed to exercise the 
rights attached to a different share or shares held by that shareholder. A 
proxy need not be a shareholder of the Company but must attend the 
Annual General Meeting to represent you. A proxy form which may be 
used to make such appointment and give proxy instructions accompanies 
this notice. If you do not have a proxy form and believe that you should 
have one, or if you require additional forms, please contact Link Asset

Wales. In the case of joint holders, where more than one of the joint 
holders purports to appoint a proxy, only the appointment submitted by 
the most senior holder will be accepted. Seniority is determined by the 
order in which the names of the joint holders appear in the Company’s 
Register of Members in respect of the joint holdings (the first-named being 
the most senior).
4. To be valid, any proxy form or other instrument appointing a proxy must be 
received by Link Asset Services at PXS 1, 34 Beckenham Road,

than 11:00 am on 24 April 2018. Please note that all forms of proxy 
received after this time will be void. A form of proxy sent electronically at any 
time that is found to contain any virus will not be accepted.
5. The return of a completed proxy form, other such instrument or any 
CREST Proxy Instruction (as further described in Notes 8 and 9 below) will 
not prevent a shareholder attending the Annual General Meeting and 
voting in person if he / she wishes to do so.

Section 146 of the Companies Act 2006 to enjoy information rights (a 
‘Nominated Person’) may, under an agreement between him / her and 
the shareholder by whom he / she was nominated, have a right to be 
appointed (or to have someone else appointed) as a proxy for the Annual 
General Meeting. If a Nominated Person has no such proxy appointment 
right or does not wish to exercise it, he / she may, under any such 
agreement, have a right to give instructions to the shareholder as to the 
exercise of voting rights. Such persons should direct any communications 
and enquiries to the registered holder of the shares by whom they were 
nominated and not to the Company or its registrar.
7. The statement of the rights of shareholders in relation to the appointment 
of proxies in Notes 3 and 4 above does not apply to Nominated Persons. 
The rights described in these notes can only be exercised by shareholders 
of the Company.
8. CREST members who wish to appoint a proxy or proxies through 
the CREST electronic proxy appointment service may do so by using the 
procedures described in the CREST Manual. CREST personal members 
or other CREST sponsored members, and those CREST members who 
have appointed a service provider(s), should refer to their CREST sponsor 
or voting service provider(s), who will be able to take the appropriate 
action on their behalf.
9. In order for a proxy appointment or instruction made using the CREST 
service to be valid, it must be properly authenticated in accordance with 
Euroclear UK and Ireland Limited’s specifications, and must contain the 
information required for such instruction, as described in the CREST 
Manual (available via www.euroclear.com/CREST). The message, 
regardless of whether it constitutes the appointment of a proxy or is an 
amendment to the instruction given to a previously appointed proxy must, 
in order to be valid, be transmitted so as to be received by the issuer’s 
agent (ID RA10) by 11:00 am on 24 April 2018. For this purpose, the time 
of receipt will be taken to be the time (as determined by the time stamp 
applied to the message by the CREST Application Host) from which the 
issuer’s agent is able to retrieve the message by enquiry to CREST in the 
manner prescribed by CREST. After this time any change of instructions 
to proxies appointed through CREST should be communicated to the 
appointee through other means.
10. CREST members and, where applicable, their CREST sponsors or voting 
service providers should note that Euroclear UK and Ireland Limited does 
not make available special procedures in CREST for any particular 
message. Normal system timings and limitations will, therefore, apply in 
relation to the input of CREST Proxy Instructions. It is the responsibility of 
the CREST member concerned to take (or, if the CREST member is a 
CREST personal member, or sponsored member, or has appointed a 
voting service provider, to procure that his / her CREST sponsor or voting 
service provider(s) take(s)) such action as shall be necessary to ensure 
that a message is transmitted by means of the CREST system by any 
particular time. In this connection, CREST members and, where 
applicable, their CREST sponsors or voting system providers are referred, 
in particular, to those sections of the CREST Manual concerning practical 
limitations of the CREST system and timings.
11. The Company may treat as invalid a CREST Proxy Instruction in the 
circumstances set out in Regulation 35(5)(a) of the Uncertificated 
Securities Regulations 2001.
12. Any corporation which is a member can appoint one or more corporate 
representatives who may exercise on its behalf all of its powers as a 
member provided that they do not do so in relation to the same shares.
13. Under Section 527 of the Companies Act 2006 members meeting the 
threshold requirements set out in that section have the right to require the 
Company to publish on a website a statement setting out any matter 
relating to:
(i) the audit of the Company’s accounts (including the Auditor’s 
Report and the conduct of the audit) that are to be laid before the 
Annual General Meeting; or
(ii) any circumstance connected with an auditor of the Company 
ceasing to hold office since the previous meeting at which annual 
accounts and reports were laid in accordance with Section 437 
of the Companies Act 2006. 
The Company may not require the shareholders requesting any such 
website publication to pay its expenses in complying with Sections 527 or 
528 of the Companies Act 2006. Where the Company is required to place 
a statement on a website under Section 527 of the Companies Act 2006, 
it must forward the statement to the Company’s auditor not later than the 
time when it makes the statement available on the website. The business 
which may be dealt with at the Annual General Meeting includes any 
statement that the Company has been required under Section 527 of the 
Companies Act 2006 to publish on a website.
14. Any member attending the Meeting has the right to ask questions 
and participate in the Meeting. The Company must cause to be answered 
any such question relating to the business being dealt with at the Meeting 
but no such answer need be given if: (i) to do so would interfere unduly 
with the preparation for the meeting or involve the disclosure of 
confidential information; (ii) the answer has already been given on a 
website in the form of an answer to a question; or (iii) it is undesirable in 
the interests of the Company or the good order of the Meeting that the 
question be answered.
15. A copy of this Notice, and other information required by Section 311A of 
the Companies Act 2006, can be found at www.taylorwimpey.co.uk/
corporate 
16. Voting on all resolutions at this year’s Annual General Meeting will 
be conducted by way of a poll, rather than on a show of hands. 
The Board believes that a poll is more representative of shareholders’ 
voting intentions because it gives as many shareholders as possible the 
opportunity to have their votes counted (whether their votes are tendered 
by proxy in advance of, or in person at, the Annual General Meeting). The 
results of the poll will be announced via a Regulatory Information Service 
and made available at www.taylorwimpey.co.uk/corporate as soon as 
practicable after the Annual General Meeting.

Taylor Wimpey plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Explanatory notes to the resolutions
Ordinary Business
Ordinary Resolutions
Ordinary resolutions require more than half of the votes cast to be in favour.
Resolution 1: To receive the annual report and financial statements
English company law requires the Directors to lay the Financial Statements of 
the Company for the year ended 31 December 2017 and the reports of the 
Directors, namely the Strategic Report, Directors’ Report, Directors’ 
Remuneration Report, and Auditor’s Report; before a general meeting 
of the Company (the Annual Report). 
Resolution 2: To declare a final dividend
The Directors recommend the payment of a final dividend of 2.44 pence per 
share in respect of the year ended 31 December 2017. If approved at the 
Annual General Meeting, the dividend will be paid on 18 May 2018 to 
shareholders who are on the Register of Members at the close of business 
on 6 April 2018.
Resolution 3: To declare a special dividend
The Company has announced its intention to return cash to its shareholders, 
through the payment of annual special dividends, always subject to market 
and performance fluctuations. Due to the size of these special dividends, the 
Company believes it is appropriate to seek prior shareholder approval for its 
payment, as it has done at the last four Annual General Meetings for 
such dividends.
Further details on the rationale for paying special dividends and the link to the 
Company’s current strategy, can be found on page 8.
The aggregate cost of the special dividend for 2018 will be around 
£340 million and will be met from profits and surplus cash generated during 
2017. If approved, it will be paid on 13 July 2018 to shareholders on the 
register at the close of business on 1 June 2018.
Dividend Re-Investment Plan
Subject to shareholders approving either or both of the dividends as set out in 
Resolutions 2 and 3 at the Annual General Meeting scheduled for 26 April 2018, 
the Company will be offering a Dividend Re-Investment Plan (DRIP) on each 
one. The DRIP is provided and administered by the DRIP plan administrator, 
Link Market Services Trustees Limited, which is authorised and regulated by the 
Financial Conduct Authority (FCA). The DRIP offers shareholders the opportunity 
to elect to invest cash dividends received on their ordinary shares, in purchasing 
further ordinary shares of the Company. These shares would be bought in the 
market, on competitive dealing terms.
The DRIP will operate automatically in respect of the Final Dividend for 2017 
(unless varied beforehand by shareholders) and all future dividends, including 
special dividends, until such time as you withdraw from the DRIP or the DRIP 
is suspended or terminated in accordance with the Terms and Conditions.
Shareholders are again reminded to check the position with regard to any 
dividend mandates that are in place, should you either wish to participate in 
the DRIP or discontinue or vary any participation, as existing mandates will 
apply to all dividend payments (including special dividends) unless 
or until revoked.
CREST
For shares held in uncertificated form (CREST), please note that elections 
continue to apply only to one dividend and a fresh election must be made, via 
CREST, for each dividend. 
Full details of the terms and conditions of the DRIP and the actions required to 
make or revoke an election, both in respect of maintenance dividends (i.e. in 
this case, the 2017 final dividend) and any special dividends, are available at 
www.signalshares.com or on request from the Registrar, Link Asset Services, 
The Registry, 34 Beckenham Road, Beckenham, Kent, BR3 4TU, email: 
shares@linkgroup.co.uk or call +44 (0)371 664 0381. Calls are charged at the 
standard geographic rate and will vary by provider. Calls outside the United 
Kingdom will be charged at the applicable international rate. The Registrar is 
open between 9:00 am and 5:30 pm, Monday to Friday excluding public 
holidays in England and Wales.
Resolution 4-12: Election of Directors
In accordance with the UK Corporate Governance Code (the ‘Code’) which 
states that all directors of FTSE 350 companies should be subject to annual 
election by shareholders, the Board has resolved that all Directors of the 
Company will retire and, being eligible, offer themselves for re-election or 
election, as appropriate, by shareholders at the Annual General Meeting.
Details of the Directors’ service contracts, remuneration and interests in the 
Company’s shares and other securities are given in the Directors’

and that each continues to demonstrate commitment to the role.
Resolution 13: Re-appointment of Deloitte LLP (Deloitte) as auditor 
of the Company 
The Company is required to appoint auditors at each general meeting at 
which accounts are laid before the shareholders. It is therefore proposed that 
the auditor is appointed from the conclusion of the 2018 Annual General 
Meeting until the conclusion of the next general meeting at which accounts 
are laid before shareholders. Following an annual review of Deloitte’s 
performance, details of which are set out on page 65, and following 
consideration of the guidance on the timing of the rotation of the external 
auditor, details of which are set out on page 65, the Board recommends the 
re-appointment of Deloitte as the Company’s auditor.
Resolution 14: Authorisation of the Audit Committee to agree on 
behalf of the Board the remuneration of Deloitte as auditor
The Board seeks shareholders’ authority for the Audit Committee to determine 
on behalf of the Board the remuneration of Deloitte for their services. The 
Board has adopted a procedure governing the appointment of Deloitte to 
carry out non-audit services, details of which are given in the Audit Committee 
Report. Details of non-audit services performed by Deloitte in 2017 are given 
in Note 6 on page 116 of the Report and Accounts.
Resolution 15: Authority to allot shares
The Directors wish to renew the existing authority to allot unissued shares in 
the Company, which was granted at the Company’s last Annual General 
Meeting held on 27 April 2017 and is due to expire at the conclusion of this 
Annual General Meeting. Accordingly, Paragraph (A) of resolution 15 would 
give the Directors the authority to allot ordinary shares or grant rights to 
subscribe for or convert any securities into ordinary shares up to an aggregate 
nominal amount equal to £10,920,922 (representing 1,092,092,200 ordinary 
shares). This amount represents approximately one-third of the issued 
ordinary share capital of the Company as at 5 March 2018, the latest 
practicable date prior to publication of this Notice of Meeting. 
In line with guidance issued by The Investment Association (formerly the 
Association of British Insurers) (TIA), paragraph (B) of resolution 15 would give 
the Directors authority to allot ordinary shares or grant rights to subscribe for 
or convert any securities into ordinary shares in connection with a rights issue 
in favour of ordinary shareholders up to an aggregate nominal amount equal 
to £21,841,845 (representing 2,184,184,500 ordinary shares), as reduced by 
the nominal amount of any shares issued under paragraph (A) of resolution 
15. This amount (before any reduction) represents approximately two-thirds of 
the issued ordinary share capital of the Company as at 5 March 2018, the 
latest practicable date prior to publication of this Notice of Meeting.
The Company does not hold any shares in treasury.
The authorities sought under paragraphs (A) and (B) of resolution 15 will expire 
at the earlier of 25 July 2019 and the conclusion of the Annual General 
Meeting of the Company to be held in 2019.
The Directors have no present intention to exercise either of the authorities 
sought under this resolution. However, if they do exercise the authorities, the 
Directors intend to follow TIA recommendations concerning their use 
(including as regards the Directors standing for re-election in certain cases).
Special Resolutions
Special resolutions require at least a 75% majority of votes cast 
to be cast in favour.
Resolutions 16 and 17: Authority to dis-apply pre-emption rights 
Resolutions 16 and 17 will be proposed as special resolutions, each of which 
requires a 75% majority of the votes to be cast in favour. They would give the 
Directors the power to allot ordinary shares (or sell any ordinary shares which 
the Company holds in treasury) for cash without first offering them to existing 
shareholders in proportion to their existing shareholdings.
The power set out in resolution 16 would be, similar to previous years, limited 
to: (a) allotments or sales in connection with pre-emptive offers and offers to 
holders of other equity securities if required by the rights of those shares, or as 
the Board otherwise considers necessary, or (b) otherwise up to an aggregate 
nominal amount of £1,638,138 (representing 163,813,800 ordinary shares).
This aggregate nominal amount represents approximately 5% of the issued 
ordinary share capital of the Company (excluding treasury shares) as at 
5 March 2018, the latest practicable date prior to publication of this Notice.
Notes to the Notice of Annual General Meeting continued
156 
Taylor Wimpey plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 In respect of the power under resolution 16 (B), the Directors confirm their 
intention to follow the provisions of the Pre-Emption Group’s Statement of 
Principles regarding cumulative usage of authorities within a rolling 3-year 
period where the Principles provide that usage in excess of 7.5% of the issued 
ordinary share capital of the Company (excluding treasury shares) should not 
take place without prior consultation with shareholders.
Resolution 17 is intended to give the Company flexibility to make non 
pre-emptive issues of ordinary shares in connection with acquisitions and 
other capital investments as contemplated by the Pre-emption Group’s 
Statement of Principles. The power under resolution 17 is in addition to that 
proposed by resolution 16 and would be limited to allotments or sales of up to 
an aggregate nominal amount of £1,638,138 (representing 163,813,800 
ordinary shares) in addition to the power set out in resolution 16. This 
aggregate nominal amount represents an additional 5% of the issued ordinary 
share capital of the Company (excluding treasury shares) as at 5 March 2018, 
the latest practicable date prior to publication of this Notice.
The powers under resolutions 16 and 17 will expire at the earlier of 
25 July 2019 and the conclusion of the Annual General Meeting of the 
Company held in 2019.
Resolution 18: Authority to make market purchases of shares 
Any purchases under this authority would be made in one or more tranches 
and would be limited in aggregate to 10% of the ordinary shares of the 
Company in issue at the close of business on 5 March 2018.
The minimum price (exclusive of expenses) which may be paid for an ordinary 
share is 1 pence per ordinary share. The maximum price to be paid on any 
exercise of the authority would not exceed the highest of (i) 105% of the 
average of the middle market quotations for the Company’s ordinary shares 
for the five business days immediately preceding the date of the purchase; 
and (ii) the higher of the price of the last independent trade and the highest 
current independent bid on the trading venues where the purchase is carried 
out. Shares purchased pursuant to these authorities could be held as treasury 
shares, which the Company can re-issue quickly and cost-effectively, and 
provides the Company with additional flexibility in the management of its 
capital base. The total number of shares held as treasury shall not at any one 
time exceed 10% of the Company’s issued share capital. Accordingly, any 
shares bought back over the 10% limit will be cancelled. The Company 
currently holds no shares in treasury.
This is a standard resolution, sought by the majority of public listed companies 
at Annual General Meetings. The Board’s current intention of utilising this 
authority is generally limited to acquiring shares for the various share scheme 
arrangements. The Board would only consider a more formal share purchase 
programme if it would result in an increase in earnings per share and was in 
the best interests of shareholders generally, having regard to all 
relevant circumstances.
The total number of options and conditional share awards to subscribe for 
ordinary shares outstanding as at the close of business on 5 March 2018 was 
37,779,438, representing approximately 1.2% of the issued ordinary share 
capital of the Company as at that date and approximately 1.3% of the 
Company’s issued ordinary share capital following any exercise in full of this 
authority to make market purchases.
This authority will last until the earlier of 25 October 2019 and the conclusion 
of the Company’s Annual General Meeting in 2019.
Special Business
Ordinary Resolutions
Resolution 19
The Remuneration Committee of the Board (the ‘Committee’) is seeking 
shareholders’ approval of the Directors’ Remuneration Report (the ‘Directors’ 
Remuneration Report’) in Resolution 19, which will be proposed as an 
ordinary resolution.
The Directors are required to prepare the Directors’ Remuneration Report, 
comprising an annual report detailing the remuneration of the Directors  
and a statement by the Chairman of the Remuneration Committee. The 
Company is required to seek shareholders’ approval in respect of the 
contents of this report on an annual basis (excluding the part containing the 
Directors’ Remuneration Policy, which was approved by shareholders at the 
Company’s 2017 Annual General Meeting when it was proposed for its latest 
three-yearly vote). The vote on the Directors’ Remuneration Report is an 
advisory one.
Resolution 20: Authority to make political donations
In order to comply with its obligations under the Companies Act 2006 and to 
avoid any inadvertent infringement of that Act, the Board wishes to renew its 
existing authority for a general level of political donation and / or expenditure. 
Resolution 20 seeks to renew the existing authority for the Company to make 
political donations and incur political expenditure. The Companies Act 2006 
requires this authority to be divided into three heads (as set out in Resolution 
20) with a separate amount specified as permitted for each. An amount not 
exceeding £250,000 for each head of the authority has been proposed. In 
accordance with the Companies Act 2006, Resolution 20 extends approval to 
all of the Company’s subsidiaries.
This authority will expire at the conclusion of the Annual General Meeting 
of the Company in 2019, unless renewal is sought at that meeting.
The Company and the Group do not make any donations to political parties 
or organisations and do not intend to going forward, but do support certain 
industry-wide bodies such as the Home Builders Federation in the UK. Whilst 
the Board does not regard this as political in nature, in certain circumstances 
such support together with donations made for charitable or similar purposes 
could possibly be treated as a donation to a political organisation under the 
relevant provisions of the Companies Act 2006. For example, a donation to a 
humanitarian charity which may also operate as a political lobby, sponsorship, 
subscriptions, paid leave to employees fulfilling public duties and payments to 
industry representative bodies could constitute a donation to a political 
organisation within the current definitions in the Companies Act 2006. 
Details of the Company’s and the Group’s charitable donations appear 
on pages 96 to 97 of the Report and Accounts.
Special Resolution
Resolution 21: Notice of general meetings
Special resolutions require at least a 75% majority of votes cast to be cast in 
favour. 
This resolution will be proposed as a special resolution and therefore requires 
a 75% majority of votes to be cast in favour. The Companies (Shareholders’ 
Rights) Regulations 2009 have increased the notice period required for 
general meetings of the Company to 21 clear days unless shareholders agree 
to a shorter notice period, which cannot be less than 14 clear days. At the 
2017 Annual General Meeting, a resolution was passed approving the 
Company’s ability to call general meetings (other than Annual General 
Meetings, which will continue to be held on at least 21 clear days’ notice) on 
not less than 14 clear days’ notice. As this approval will expire at the 
conclusion of this Annual General Meeting, Resolution 21 proposes its 
renewal. The shorter notice period of 14 clear days would not be used as a 
matter of routine for any general meeting, but only where the flexibility is 
merited by the business of a particular meeting and is thought to be to the 
advantage of shareholders as a whole. The renewed approval will be effective 
until the Company’s Annual General Meeting in 2019, when it is intended that 
a similar resolution will be proposed.
Note that in order to be able to call a general meeting on less than 21 clear 
days’ notice, the Company must in respect of that meeting make available 
electronic voting to all shareholders.

Shareholders’ services
Web communications
Shareholders have previously passed a resolution enabling the Company to 
make documents and information available to shareholders by electronic 
means and via a website, rather than by sending hard copies. This way of 
communicating is enabled in accordance with the Companies Act 2006, Rule 
6 of the Disclosure and Transparency Rules and the Company’s Articles 
of Association.
Making documents and information available electronically:
 – Enables the Company to reduce printing and postage costs.
 – Allows faster access to information and enables shareholders to access 
documents on the day they are published on the Company’s website.
 – Reduces the amount of resources consumed, such as paper, and lessens 
the impact of printing and mailing activities on the environment.
The Company provides hard copy documentation to those shareholders who 
have requested this and is, of course, happy to provide hard copies to any 
shareholders upon request.
The Company’s website is www.taylorwimpey.co.uk and shareholder 
documentation made available electronically is generally accessible at

Dividend Re-Investment Plan
You can choose to invest your cash dividends, including any special dividend, 
in purchasing Taylor Wimpey shares on the market under the terms of the 
Dividend Re-Investment Plan (‘DRIP’). For further information on the Plan and 
how to join, contact Link Asset Services.
Shareholders are again reminded to check the position with regard to any 
dividend mandates that are in place, should you either wish to participate in the 
DRIP or discontinue or vary any participation, as existing mandates will apply to 
all dividend payments (including special dividends) unless or until revoked.
CREST
The Company offers shareholders who hold their Taylor Wimpey shares 
in CREST a facility for the receipt of dividends through the CREST system. 
For shares held in uncertificated form (CREST), please note that elections 
continue to apply only to one dividend and a fresh election must be made, via 
CREST, for each dividend. 
Full details of the terms and conditions of the DRIP and the actions required to 
make or revoke an election, both in respect of maintenance dividends (i.e. in 
this case, the 2017 final dividend) and any special dividends, are available at 
www.signalshares.com or on request from the Registrar, Link Asset Services, 
The Registry, 34 Beckenham Road, Beckenham, Kent, BR3 4TU, email: 
shares@linkgroup.co.uk tel: +44 (0)371 664 0381. Calls are charged at the

Kingdom will be charged at the applicable international rate. Lines are open 
between 9:00 am and 5:30 pm Monday to Friday excluding public holidays 
in England and Wales.
Dividend mandates
We strongly encourage all shareholders to receive their cash dividends 
by direct transfer to a bank or building society account. This ensures that 
dividends are credited promptly to shareholders without the cost and 
inconvenience of having to pay in dividend cheques at a bank. If you wish to 
use this cost-effective and simple facility, complete and return the dividend 
mandate form attached to your dividend cheque. Additional mandate forms 
may be obtained from Link Asset Services.
Duplicate share register accounts
If you are receiving more than one copy of our Report and Accounts, it may 
be that your shares are registered in two or more accounts on our Register of 
Members. You might wish to consider merging them into one single entry. 
Please contact Link Asset Services who will be pleased to carry out your 
instructions in this regard.
Share dealing services
We have arranged both telephone and online share dealing services. Link

companies that have Link as their registrar. The services are operated by Link 
Asset Services. To use the services either visit www.linksharedeal.com or

form of proxy you have been sent). Shareholders are not in any way obliged to 
use this service when dealing in the Company’s shares.
Taylor Wimpey and CREST
Taylor Wimpey shares can be held in CREST accounts, which do not require 
share certificates. This may make it quicker and easier for some shareholders 
to settle stock market transactions. Shareholders who deal infrequently may, 
however, prefer to continue to hold their shares in certificated form and this 
facility will remain available for the time being, pending the likely general 
introduction of dematerialised shareholdings in due course.

Unsolicited approaches to shareholders 
and ‘Boiler Room’ scams
We receive reports from time to time from Taylor Wimpey shareholders who 
have each received what appear to be fraudulent approaches from third 
parties with respect to their shareholding in the Company. In some cases 
these are ‘cold calls’ and in others correspondence. They generally purport to 
be from a firm of solicitors or an investment company and offer, or hold out 
the prospect of, large gains on Taylor Wimpey shares or other investments 
you may hold.
The approaches normally include the seeking of an advance payment from 
the shareholder, the disclosure of the shareholder’s bank details or the sale of 
an unrelated investment. Shareholders are advised to be extremely wary of 
such approaches and advised to only deal with firms authorised by the UK 
Financial Conduct Authority (FCA). More information is available on 
our website www.taylorwimpey.co.uk/corporate/shareholder-information/
boiler-room-scams and you can check whether an enquirer is properly 
authorised and report scam approaches by contacting the FCA 
on www.fca.org.uk/consumers or by calling +44 (0)800 111 6768.
