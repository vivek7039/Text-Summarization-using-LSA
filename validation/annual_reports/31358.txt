STRATEGIC 
REPORT
Commenting on the results and 
prospects, Mike Love, Non-Executive 
Chairman, said:
“The current trading performance of 
the Group is positive with orders for 
both Dillistone Systems and Voyager 
Software ahead of the same period 
in 2017 – with the former more than 
25% up on the same period in 2017 
and the latter having one of the best 
quarters for new business orders in  
its history.
 Our GatedTalent product, launched 
in October 2017, has been very well 
received with a growth trajectory that, 
we believe, will lead to it becoming the 
dominant product in its market space 
within a year.
 Recurring revenues for 2017 were at 
record levels and, despite the ongoing 
investment in product development, 
cash reserves have held up well. 
Overall, despite the evident pressure 
on new licence sales in 2017 and the 
loss for the year of £0.071m, going 
into 2018 the Group believes that it is 
now in a stronger position in its core 
markets than in recent years.
 This confidence in the future allows 
us to recommend a final dividend 
of 0.5p and we anticipate reporting 
further positive progress as the year 
progresses.”

TIMELINE 
The original FileFinder software 
was developed by David Dillistone, 
himself a retained search consultant. 
While it was initially created for in-
house use, David soon realised that 
there was a market for it beyond his 
own firm, and so he created David 
Dillistone Systems. 
By the late 1990s, David had retired 
and the business – now renamed as 
Dillistone Systems – was owned by 
Custom Business Systems (CBS). 
CBS invested heavily in the firm 
and, by the end of the decade, 
offices had been established on 
three continents.

2006
2014
2015 2016

2013
2011
2012
1990
In 2003, the current management 
team took part in a management 
buyout of the business. The dawn of 
the internet meant that it became far 
easier to sell the FileFinder system 
internationally, and, as a result, 
Dillistone Systems grew rapidly. 
In March 2011, FileFinder 10 was 
released after over two years of 
development. In September 2011, 
the Group made its first acquisition: 
Voyager Software. 
In 2008, a decision was  
taken to significantly increase  
R&D expenditure, and the 
development of the next generation 
of FileFinder began. 
In 2006, the Group floated on the 
AIM market of the London Stock 
Exchange (DSG.L). 
In September 2012, Voyager Infinity 
was launched after three years of 
development. 
In July 2013, the Group made its 
second acquisition: FCP Internet. 
In October 2014, the Group 
acquired ISV Software. 2014 saw 
the release of FileFinder Anywhere, 
a market leading product suited to 
mobile working. 
Voyager software division launched 
ISV Online and the first of a suite of 
mobile apps.
Voyager Software division – launch 
of cloud hosted version of Infinity; 
launch of integration of ISV FastPath 
and Infinity; and launch of version 6 
of Evolve.

GatedTalent was established in 
2017 to provide a network allowing 
executives to share information with 
selected executive recruiters in a 
GDPR compliant manner.

GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL 
STATEMENTS
Voyager Software division
Voyager Software itself became a part of the 
Dillistone Group in September 2011. It has 
always provided end-to-end recruitment 
solutions to the recruitment sector, typically 
those working on a contingency basis, and 
continues to do so to this day. In September 
2012, Voyager Software launched its latest 
generation of recruitment solutions with its 
Infinity product. Infinity is designed to improve 
the performance and efficiency of recruitment 
businesses specialising in permanent, contract 
and temporary roles. With automation at its 
heart, it meets the demands of flexibility and 
functionality required by these recruitment 
firms. Alongside Voyager Software’s VDQ 
product, for pure fast paced temporary 
agencies, and Mid-Office, the pay-and-bill 
solution for the back office, the business covers 
the whole contingency recruitment space. 
In 2013, the Group acquired FCP Internet, 
suppliers of the evolve™ SaaS product, and 
this has subsequently been integrated into the 
Voyager Software Division. In October 2014,  
a further acquisition, ISV Software – a  
supplier of skills testing and training  
services, was also incorporated into the 
Division. Today, the Voyager Software Division’s 
products are used in over 20 different countries 
by many thousands of users in different-sized 
recruitment businesses. The Division has 
offices in the UK and Australia and employs 
around 60 people.

OVERVIEW DILLISTONE GROUP PLC - Annual Report and Accounts 2017

Dr Mike Love 
Non-Executive Chairman
the Group has accelerated its acquisition 
intangibles amortisation by £0.459m  
taking total amortisation to £0.838m  
(2016: £0.379m).
The Board has raised £0.400m from the 
Directors and PDMRs (person discharging 
managerial responsibilities) in the form of a 
convertible loan note to provide continued 
funding for GatedTalent.The loan notes carry 
an interest rate of 8.15% and a conversion 
price of 71.6p. The loan note has a 3-year 
duration but with various rights for early 
conversion or repayment. 
Dividends
In view of the fund raising carried out to 
develop GatedTalent, we did not pay an 
interim dividend. However we propose paying 
a final dividend of 0.5p (2016: 2.8p) subject 
to Shareholder approval. The dividend will 
be payable on 13 July 2018 to Shareholders 
on the register on 15 June 2018. Shares will 
trade ex dividend from 14 June 2018. Future 
dividends will depend on Group performance. 
Staff
Our staff are fundamental to our success. 
It is through their efforts, commitment and 
determination that we continue to be a leading 
technology provider in the sectors we serve. 
On behalf of the Board I would like to take this 
opportunity to thank all of our staff for their 
individual and collective contributions during 
2017 and for the huge effort demonstrated 
during the early months of 2018, supporting 
our GDPR related projects.
Outlook
Both our Dillistone Systems and Voyager 
Software divisions have enjoyed strong demand 
for our products and services during the first 
quarter of 2018. The Board is delighted to note 
that, while Voyager revenues will clearly be 
impacted by the previously announced loss of 
a legacy contract, Q1 2018 saw one of its best 
ever quarters in terms of new contract wins.
After a slow January, orders for Dillistone 
Systems’ FileFinder product improved 
significantly in February and March and ended 
the quarter more than 25% up on the same 
period in 2017. Many of these orders were 
driven by demand for our GatedTalent product 
which features exclusive integration with 
FileFinder Anywhere.
In our 27 February announcement, we 
revealed that we had achieved the milestone 
of 100 clients for our GatedTalent service. 
We continue to see strong demand for the 
platform, with more than 160 firms having 
now signed contracts. The division has now 
generated its first subscription revenue.
Long term revenue growth from the 
GatedTalent platform will be derived from 
interactions with executives who register with 
the service and create a profile. Executives 
join to be “On the radar” of our executive 
recruiter clients. They may register directly at 
www.GatedTalent.com or via an invitation from 
a Search firm – these invitations are typically 
sent as part of an executive recruiter’s GDPR 
compliancy process.  
The platform is working well and as expected 
and the throughput on the GatedTalent 
platform is growing month on month and is 
expected to accelerate rapidly over the period 
to the end of July. The number of profiles is 
also growing and is also expected to increase 
quickly over the coming months. 
Having originally anticipated that our clients 
would send around 1 million invitations, our 
current belief is that the number of invitations 
will be around 3 million. The majority of 
our clients are expected to leave mailing 
of compliancy messages as late as legally 
possible and, despite the thousands of 
messages already sent, we believe that the vast 
majority of our clients will not send messages 
before May, with a number of firms likely to 
complete the process in June or even July. 
We are seeing significant variances in invitation 
conversion rates between clients. Some firms 
are seeing in excess of 8% of invitations 
leading to Profiles; others are seeing a fraction 
of 1% converting. What is apparent from the 
Profiles that have been created so far, however, 
is that our executive talent pool will be both 
senior and diverse. Currently, the three most 
common Job Titles for our Executives are 
“CEO”, “Managing Director” and “General 
Manager”. We have onboarded profiles from 
executives in 75 countries. A heatmap with 
further information on profile data is available 
at www.gatedtalent.com/metrics/.
The Group has paid dividends throughout its 
time as a public company and, having ended 
the year with cash of £1.390m, the Board is 
pleased to be in a position to pay a dividend of 
0.5p per share.
Dr Mike Love
Non-Executive Chairman
26 April 2018
CHAIRMAN’S STATEMENT
For the year ended 31 December 2017
2017 was an exciting year for the 
Dillistone Group with the launch of 
GatedTalent (www.GatedTalent.com) 
on 9 October 2017 at the World 
Executive Search Congress. 
Our business has traditionally been involved in 
the supply of technology to the recruiting and 
associated sectors. GatedTalent is a private 
network – a tool which allows executives to 
share information with trusted recruiters. It is 
a first for our Group and has the potential to 
transform the nature of the Group’s underlying 
business model from software to data. 
More generally, trading across the Group was 
challenging in 2017, although we did see some 
improvement in operational performance in the 
second half of the year – despite the increasing 
costs associated with GatedTalent. Overall, 
Group revenue fell 4% to £9.582m, of which 
recurring revenue grew 6% to £7.474m. 
Adjusted operating profit dropped significantly 
to £0.309m in part due to the investment 
made in GatedTalent and in part due to a 
decline in new licence sales. Excluding our 
GatedTalent investment, the Group remained 
cash generative across this year.
As anticipated in our Interim statement, a 
SaaS contract with a major client expired in 
early 2018. This contract, with a client using 
a legacy product acquired as a result of an 
acquisition made several years ago, was 
worth in the region of £600,000 per annum in 
contribution terms to the Group. Consequently,  www.dillistonegroup.com 07 www.dillistonegroup.com 07
What is GatedTalent?
Imagine a private database of the world’s global executives. Imagine if this database included detailed, private information on those executives – 
including biographical, aspirational and often compensation data. Imagine if the database was curated by the executives themselves in a manner 
that made it entirely GDPR friendly. Imagine if the information provided by the executive was enhanced by detailed company data. And imagine 
that database offered seamless two-way integration with the leading executive search CRM. And... one more thing. Imagine this database was 
huge. And global. That’s what GatedTalent is. 
How does it work?
Virtually any executive recruiter storing 
information covered by the GDPR will need 
to go through a process of confirming and 
proving that their data is legal. As part 
of this process, they will typically make 
contact with huge numbers of executives 
they store in their databases. GatedTalent 
will manage this process and then, 
optionally, will invite the executive to create 
a detailed – but private – profile which 
will be shared only with recruiters that the 
executive has chosen to trust. Recruiters 
using the platform will earn credits for any 
executives who they introduce and who go 
on to create a profile – those credits may 
be used to search the anonymised database 
of “unconnected executives” and make 
connection requests to executives who are 
currently not known to the firm.
How is this different to LinkedIn  
or Xing?
LinkedIn and Xing are both social networks. 
Any information uploaded to these 
platforms is essentially publicly available. 
That means that many of the most senior 
executives do not use these networks – and 
they wouldn’t dream of sharing private 
data such as compensation on an open 
platform. With GatedTalent, search firms 
make connection requests and executives 
say YES or NO. It’s as simple as that. 
Executives control who sees some, all or 
none of their data.
How is it different to other online 
services that are designed to 
allow executives to network with 
recruiters?
Over the course of 2018, our executive 
search firm clients will invite around 3 
million executives to join the platform. 
The largest comparable product – the 
AESC’s Bluesteps – has about 115,000 
profiles within it, despite having been in 
existence for around a decade. We are 
confident that, within a year, our data pool 
will be close to or larger and more up to 
date than Bluesteps. It will then continue 
to grow, because – for the thousands of 
FileFinder users worldwide – the database 
will be fully integrated with everything they 
do. Our users will find executives in the 
platform and so executives will want to be 
in the platform. Furthermore – unlike most 
products in this space – we’ll never charge 
the executives. We don’t believe that the 
world’s most senior executives need to pay 
to interact with search firms.

CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER’S REVIEW
For the year ended 31 December 2017
“ Dillistone Systems division is 
expected to benefit particularly 
from the launch of GatedTalent, 
which targets the same market as 
FileFinder and is tightly integrated.”
Jason Starr 
Chief Executive
Dillistone Group Plc is a global 
leader in the supply of solutions  
and services to the recruitment 
sector worldwide.
Strategy and objectives
The Group’s strategy is to grow the business 
both organically and through acquisition. 
This strategy is made possible through our 
commitment to product development, which 
ensures that the business continues to 
command a leading role in all of the markets in 
which it operates. 
Our acquisition strategy typically entails 
consideration of businesses offering:
• products that would further increase 
market share in the Group’s core markets; 
• legacy applications, where clients could 
be transferred to our modern suite of 
products; or
• complementary applications, which may 
be cross-sold to clients of the Group.
The Group’s objectives are principally to:
• ensure our products meet the needs of 
the recruitment sector through continual 
investment and development;
• be a leading player in all of the markets 
we serve;
• develop our staff, delivering progressive 
career development;
• increase our profitability and deliver 
increased shareholder value year on year 
in conjunction with a progressive  
dividend policy.

CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER’S REVIEW
For the year ended 31 December 2017
Our business model
The business is split into three Divisions. Dillistone Systems and Voyager Software are our established businesses, with GatedTalent launched in the 
second half of 2017.
Dillistone Systems specialises in the supply of software and services into executive-level recruitment teams. Voyager Software’s clientele are primarily 
involved in contingent recruitment, including permanent placement, contract placement and the provision of temporary staff. GatedTalent is a private 
network of executives, accessed by executive recruiters. This Division generates revenue based on a combination of recruiter subscription and 
transaction fees for connecting with executives. There is a close relationship between GatedTalent and Dillistone Systems.
The majority of our products are commercialised through one or more of the following:
1. An upfront licence fee plus a recurring support fee;
2. Software as a Service (SaaS) subscription basis; or
3. A hybrid model incorporating an upfront payment and recurring support and cloud hosting fees.
There is a continuing move away from the upfront license model towards our cloud delivery services.
The business operates out of four countries: the UK, Germany, the US and Australia. As well as supplying and supporting our software we also host  
the software for a proportion of our clients. This is done through data centres in Europe, the Americas, Singapore and Australia.
In 2000+ ﬁrms across 60 countries, our clients are situated  
across the entire recruitment landscape.
They say that we provide them with:
Stability, ﬂexibility and functionality
Easy access to their data 
Rapid deployment
Ongoing development ensures upgrade path for clients
Our large client base means that we do not depend  
on a small number of clients.
We generate revenue typically through three pricing mechanisms:
Upfront licence fee plus recurring support fee
Software as a Service (SaaS) subscription basis
Hybrid model incorporating upfront payment 
and recurring support and hosting fees

CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER’S REVIEW
For the year ended 31 December 2017 continued
Group review of the business
2017 saw recurring revenues grow 6% to 
£7.474m (2016: £7.027m) reflecting the 
increasing adoption of our SaaS offering.  
Non-recurring revenues decreased to £1.644m 
(2016: £2.370m). As a result, overall revenues 
decreased by 4% to £9.582m (2016: £9.963m) 
with recurring revenues representing 78% 
of Group revenues (2016: 71%). Costs have 
increased in part due to GatedTalent which 
made an operating loss of £0.439m and which 
was in development for all of 2017. We saw our 
first revenue from GatedTalent in Q1 of 2018 
although, as anticipated, revenue in the first 
half will not be significant and the Division will 
be loss making in 2018.

Divisional Reviews
Dillistone Systems
The Dillistone Systems division is primarily 
focused on providing technology solutions to 
the executive search market via our range of 
“FileFinder” applications. This client group is 
made up of both executive search firms and 
executive search teams in major organisations.
Dillistone Systems’ head office is in London and 
it has offices in the US, Germany and Australia. 
The Division accounts for 47% (2016: 49%) of 
the Group’s revenue and it saw revenue fall 6% 
to £4.548m (2016: £4.858m). The Division is 
expected to benefit particularly from the launch 
of GatedTalent, which targets the same market 
as FileFinder and is tightly integrated.
Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and 
amortisation (‘EBITDA’) fell to £0.778m (2016: 
£1.434m) as sales fell and costs increased. 
Total amortisation and depreciation charge 
was £0.589m (2016: £1.229m). (In 2016 we 
reviewed our amortisation policy for capitalised 
development costs to bring it more into line with 
industry practice by writing off all such costs 
over five years rather than a range of five to ten 
years and the impact of this on the Dillistone 
division was an increase to the 2016 charge 
by £0.600m). Operating profit for 2017 was 
£0.189m (2016: £0.205m).
Voyager Software
Voyager Software is a provider of technology 
products targeted at the entire recruitment 
landscape, from front office to back office 
and bureaus, and includes both recruitment 
management systems and pre-employment 
skills testing technology.
In 2017, the Voyager Software division 
accounted for 53% (2016: 51%) of Group 
revenues. The Division’s revenues decreased 
by 1% to £5.034m (2016: £5.105m). EBITDA 
increased by 10% to £1.200m (2016: 
£1.093m). Amortisation and depreciation 
increased to £0.511m (2016: £0.461m). 
Divisional operating profit increased 9% to 
£0.689m (2016: £0.632m).
2017 saw some major developments in the 
Division including:
• Development of TempNinja – A new mobile 
companion app allowing candidates to view 
and accept temporary jobs, update their 
availability and chat directly with recruiters 
using Voyager’s popular VDQ! and Infinity 
SaaS solution.
• Additional functionality released in 
Infinity (including Infinity SaaS) including 
enhanced support for the temporary 
recruitment sector & Power BI reporting. 
• A well-received industry wide education 
programme around the forthcoming GDPR 
legislation being recognised as an industry 
leader.
• Enhancements and new content for ISV.
Online including tests around the GDPR.
GatedTalent
GatedTalent was established in 2017 to 
provide a network allowing executives to share 
information with selected executive recruiters 
in a GDPR compliant manner. The GatedTalent 
product was under development throughout 
2017 and therefore did not generate revenue. 
GatedTalent is the most exciting product we 
have developed in recent years. The platform 
is free to executives. Revenue will be generated 
from executive recruiters through subscriptions 
to the platform and through charges for 
”connection requests” made through the 
platform.
The platform is now live, with clients using it; 
compliance messages being sent and profiles 
being created. Subscription revenue is now 
being generated. We expect that GatedTalent 
will manage the process of sending around 
3 million such messages during the course 
of 2018. We believe that the vast majority of 
our clients will not send messages before May 
2018, with a number of firms likely to complete 
the process in June or even July.
The Division is effectively a start-up business 
within the Group and is expected to be loss 
making in 2018, although we do anticipate that 
it will have a direct and positive impact on the 
performance of our Dillistone Systems business 
starting in 2018. During 2017, GatedTalent 
incurred an operating loss of £0.439m and 
development expenditure of £0.391m was 
capitalised.
The Board is confident that all three Divisions 
have strong futures.
Financial risk management
The Group’s operations expose it to a number 
of risks that include the effect of changes in 
interest rates, credit, foreign currency exchange 
rates and liquidity. The Group does not trade in 
financial instruments. Further details in relation 
to these risks are shown in note 25. 
Interest rate risk
The Group is exposed to interest rate risk 
through its floating rate overdraft, and through 
its management of retained cash. The Group 
monitors its exposure to interest rate risk when 
borrowing and investing its cash resources. 
Credit risk
The Group has a large customer base in excess 
of 2,000 customers and is not dependent on 
a small number of customers. Accordingly, 
the Group does not believe it is exposed to 
significant credit risk. In addition, it only places 
money with banks with strong credit ratings. 
Exchange risk
The Group is exposed to translation and 
transaction foreign exchange risk. The Group’s 
foreign operations primarily trade in their own 
currencies, reducing the transaction risk.  
As a result, the main foreign exchange 
transactional exposure arises when repatriating 
profits. The Group only seeks to remit cash 
when required in the UK and it usually has 
some flexibility on timing of such appropriations 
to minimise any exchange losses. The Group 
is, however, exposed to translation risks on net 
assets held. 
Liquidity risk
Although the Group has some borrowings, it 
maintains positive cash resources and has 
sufficient available funds for its operations and 
planned expansion of its existing activities.  www.dillistonegroup.com 11
CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER’S REVIEW
For the year ended 31 December 2017 continued
Principal risks and uncertainties
There are a number of risks and uncertainties which could have an impact on the Group’s long term performance and cause actual results to differ 
materially from expected and historical results. The Directors seek to identify material risks and put in place policies and procedures to mitigate any 
exposure. The table of risks that follows gives details of the principal risks and the approach being taken to manage them.
Risk Potential adverse impact Mitigation
Economic risk The recruitment industry has a reputation for being 
vulnerable to the cyclical nature of the economy. This can 
impact significantly on non-recurring revenue and to a 
lesser extent recurring revenue. 
The Company operates globally and so is not reliant on 
one economy. It enjoys a high percentage of recurring 
revenues. Acquisitions have increased the exposure to the 
UK economy. Future acquisitions may be overseas.
In a downturn there may be a reduction in new permanent 
hires which may be replaced by temporary hires.  
The temporary recruitment market is potentially anti-
cyclical. The Group’s products support both permanent 
and temporary hires.
Innovation and new products help maintain opportunities 
for the business world-wide.
New product risk All technology suppliers need to develop new products and 
applications and there is always a risk that new products 
may lead to issues. This could damage the Group’s 
reputation and result in loss of new orders and therefore 
reduce revenue growth. It could also result in claims 
against the Group.
The cost and time frame for developing and releasing new 
products could be a bigger drain on resource than built into 
budgets and forecasts. 
Products are tested pre-launch, and launch and 
implementation strategies developed to minimise risks. 
The development plan is regularly reviewed by 
management and the Board.
Agile project methodology so stakeholders have regular 
visibility and influence on what is being developed.
Product Manager added in 2018 for Dillistone Systems  
to help ensure product is fit for purpose.
Additional UX (User Experience) Resource to be added  
to help deliver software that meets the needs of clients  
in 2018.
Attrition of customer 
base
Failure to attract new customers, or the loss of existing 
customers, may have a detrimental effect on the Group’s 
ability to generate revenues.
Actively manage existing customer relationships through 
account management structures and promptly dealing  
with issues. 
The Group continues to invest in new products with new 
features being added.
Competitor activity The market for recruitment software is extremely 
fragmented with a large number of small suppliers 
operating in all of the Group’s geographical markets. 
Very few of these suppliers have the necessary financial, 
technical and marketing resources to be able to develop 
their competitive position. However, the competition may 
intensify through consolidation or new entrants to  
the market.
Some competitors offer a broader product range enabling 
them to compete across the whole of the sector.
The businesses can easily lose market share if its products 
are not well regarded either from being “out of date”  
or “buggy”.
Some firms may try to compete on price, particularly if the 
market deteriorates.
The Group has strong customer relationships and uses 
account management to keep in touch with clients.
The Group continues to invest in its product development 
and 2017 saw the continued development of temp 
functionality to Infinity, TempNinja and the continued 
development of ISV Online. The Group continues to 
innovate and provide solutions to client needs.
There is a focus on fixing bugs and issues as they arise to 
ensure the user experience is good.
Pricing strategies are reviewed on a regular basis. 
If successful, GatedTalent will provide a competitive 
advantage to FileFinder. Close integration with FileFinder is 
likely to lead to a sustained competitive advantage for our 
executive search CRM platform.
The Group continues to look into developing new products 
and additional features to more readily compete.

CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER’S REVIEW
For the year ended 31 December 2017 continued
Risk Potential adverse impact Mitigation
Business continuity 
risks associated with 
information systems, 
operational failure, 
data security and 
cyber security risks
A failure of systems or failure of hosting facilities leading 
to loss of customer confidence in the Group being able to 
deliver their requirements.
Loss or corruption of data held on behalf of customers 
which could have a detrimental effect on their confidence 
in data security processes and could cause financial loss.
External attacks on servers could result in lost or corrupted 
data and loss of reputation. 
Each division is reliant on data centres. Work ongoing to 
move data centres to the cloud through Amazon and Azure. 
Plans are regularly reviewed on how to improve data centre 
management as the business grows worldwide. 
Data backups occur at least daily and the necessary 
test carried out on a regular basis to ensure data can be 
restored. 
Penetration testing helps minimise the risk of attacks. 
Regular review of Group wide infrastructure to improve cyber 
defences locally and at data centres.
Employee engagement 
and retention
Capability to meet the demands of the markets in which 
the Group operates and competes effectively with other IT 
suppliers is largely dependent on the skills, experience and 
performance of staff.
Failure to attract or retain high calibre employees could 
seriously impede future growth and present performance. 
Reliability on small group of people, especially in parts of  
the business.
To retain staff the Group operates competitive remuneration 
packages.
Appraisals are carried out which also consider individual’s 
personal development.
Cross training being carried out where possible.
Ability to finance 
acquisitions and new 
development
The Group wants to grow either by acquisition or through 
development of its own products. This requires that it will 
have the ability to fund such expansion either via borrowing 
or placement, or through the availability of its own cash 
resources.
Ongoing discussions with investors and potential investors to 
build a following in Dillistone.
Management capacity Size of business means that management tends to be 
stretched and under resourced. As the business grows there 
may be insufficient support to ensure that the growth is 
effectively managed and integrated.
In 2018 we anticipate a further strengthening of product 
development management capability and review of 
divisional structures.
Foreign exchange 
volatility
The Group has substantial operations in both the UK and 
overseas. Profits are exposed to variations in exchange 
rates thereby impacting on reported profits.
There is usually some element of natural hedge in the 
currencies, although if sterling strengthens against all 
currencies it can have a negative impact on results.
Brexit Potential economic uncertainty could lead to a reduction in 
orders in the short to medium term, impacting adversely on 
the Group’s results.
Clearly, any changes brought about by Brexit are likely to 
be implemented in the lead up to the exit date, which might 
introduce changes to the UK-EU trading arrangements.
This may impact where recruiting individuals with European 
languages requirement. It may increase the time and 
difficulty in recruiting skilled employees.
Clients usually choose best in class and already buy from 
global firms. The Group continues to monitor implications 
and is continually reviewing its products and pricing to 
ensure it stays competitive.
We deal with visa requirements for some staff already.
Data protection 
legislation
Ensure that all Group products comply with international 
data protection legislation and demonstrate to clients that 
they do.
Work being carried out to ensure data is secure and 
protected at appropriate levels.
Senior member of executive team has GDPR practitioner 
certificate. Appropriate internal committee established.
Numerous webinars held for clients and prospects on the 
impact of GDPR.
Ability to source new 
talent
The Group is reliant on specialist skills, especially in 
Development and Dev Ops and it may not be possible to 
recruit resources locally.
Look more broadly at where staff are based or use of 
outsourcing. www.dillistonegroup.com 13

FINANCIAL REVIEW
For the year ended 31 December 2017
“ The Group finished the year with cash 
funds of £1.390m (2016: £1.537m); 
bank borrowings of £nil (2016: 
£0.158m) and a convertible loan of 
£0.391m (after taking into account  
the equity adjustment).”
Julie Pomeroy 
Finance Director
Total revenues decreased by 4% 
to £9.582m (2016: £9.963m) with 
recurring revenues increasing by 
6% to £7.474m (2016: £7.027m) 
while non-recurring revenues 
decreased to £1.644m (2016: 
£2.370m). 
Third party resell revenue amounted to 
£0.464m in the period (2016: £0.566m). 
Cost of sales increased by 4% to £1.536m 
(2016: £1.478m), mainly due to continued 
investment in cloud based hosting facilities 
through Azure and Amazon.
Administrative costs, excluding acquisition 
related items, depreciation and amortisation, 
rose 10% to £6.637m (2016: £6.052m). In part 
this was due to the investment in GatedTalent 
which made an operating loss £0.439m. Total 
depreciation and amortisation, decreased to 
£1.100m (2016: £1.690m) following the one-off 
adjustment of £0.720m in 2016 relating to the 
review of its amortisation policy for capitalised 
development costs. 
Acquisition related administrative costs totalled 
£0.823m (2016: £0.331m) and were in respect 
of the amortisation of intangibles arising on 
the Voyager, FCP and ISV acquisitions and 
movement in the estimation of contingent 
consideration. The current year figure also 
includes an acceleration of the acquisition 
intangibles amortisation as a result of the loss of 
a major contract in that business as disclosed 
in note 13. Finance cost includes £0.005m 
(2016: £0.015m) relating to the unwinding 
of the discount in respect of the contingent 
consideration.
Recurring revenues covered 97% of 
administrative expenses before acquisition 
related and one-off costs (2016: 100%). 
Excluding depreciation and amortisation of our 
own internal development, the administrative 
costs are covered 113% (2016: 116%) by 
recurring revenues.
The Group benefitted from a tax credit in 
2017 of £0.454m (2016: credit £0.134m). 
The 2017 credit reflects the significant R&D 
tax credits available to all three divisions and 
the assumption that any tax losses will be 
surrendered for the R&D tax credit payment. 
It has also been impacted by the reduction in 
tax rate to 19.25% (2016: 20%) as well as the 
impact of the one-off adjustment in respect 
of amortisation of development costs and 
adjustments to prior year computations.  
These benefits are partially offset by the 
higher rates of corporation tax that are payable 
overseas. The acquisition related items tax 
credit reflects the reduction in deferred tax that 
arises as amortisation is charged in the profit 
and loss account. 
Profit for the year before acquisition related 
and other one-off items amounted to £0.606m 
(2016: £1.395m). The 2017 adjusted profits 
benefitted from a tax credit of £0.303m 
(2016: tax credit of £0.063m). The loss for 
the year after acquisition related items and 
other one-off items was £0.071m (2016: profit 
£0.526m). Basic earnings per share (EPS) fell 
to (0.36)p (2016: 2.68p). Fully diluted EPS fell 
to (0.36)p (2016: 2.62p). Adjusted basic EPS 
fell to 3.08p (2016: 7.10p). 
Capital expenditure
The Group invested £1.506m in property, plant 
and equipment and product development 
during the year (2016: £1.126m). This 
expenditure included £1.358m (2016: 
£1.056m) spent on capitalised development 
related costs.

Trade and other payables
As with previous years, the trade and other 
payables includes deferred income, ie income 
which has been billed in advance but is not 
recognised as income at that time.  
This principally relates to support, SaaS and 
cloud hosting renewals, which are billed in 2017 
but are in respect of services to be delivered 
in 2018. Contractual income of this type is 
recognised monthly over the period to which it 
relates. It also includes deposits taken for work 
which has not yet been completed; as such 
income is only recognised when the work is 
substantially complete or the client software 
goes “live”. Also included in trade and other 
payables is £0.146m (2016: £0.375m) in 
respect of contingent consideration. At the end 
of 2017, there was one tranche of contingent 
consideration payable in respect of ISV relating 
to the revenue in the nine month period to 
30 September 2017 and this was paid in 
February 2018. 
Cash
The Group finished the year with cash funds of 
£1.390m (2016: £1.537m); bank borrowings of 
£nil (2016: £0.158m) and a convertible loan of 
£0.391m (after taking into account the equity 
adjustment). This is after capital expenditure 
of £1.506m, the final payment to the vendors 
of ISV of £0.219m and dividend payments of 
£0.551m.

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE REPORT
For the year ended 31 December 2017
Dillistone Group Plc (the “Company”) is 
committed to maintaining high standards of 
corporate governance. The Company does not 
comply with the provisions of the UK Corporate 
Governance Code (the “Code”) in its entirety 
and it is not required to do so. However, the 
Board recognises the importance of sound 
corporate governance and will take appropriate 
measures to ensure that the Company complies 
with the main provision of the Code as far as 
practicable and to the extent appropriate given 
the Company’s size, assets, liabilities and other 
relevant information. The summary below 
further describes the Company’s approach to 
corporate governance.
Leadership
The Board comprises a Non-Executive 
Chairman, one Independent Non-Executive 
Director and five Executive Directors.  
All Directors are obliged to submit themselves 
for re-election at least every three years.  
The Chairman and Non-Executive Director are 
considered to be independent of management 
and free from any business or other relationship 
which could materially interfere with the 
exercise of their independent judgement. Giles 
Fearnley is the current Senior Independent 
Director and his shareholding of approximately 
2.3% is not considered by the Board to change 
his independence. 
Effectiveness
To enable the Board to discharge its duties, 
all Directors have full and timely access to all 
relevant information. They are also able to take 
independent professional advice as appropriate. 
The Board has two committees:
Audit Committee
The Audit Committee comprises the Chairman 
and the Non-Executive Director and usually 
meets twice during the year. 
The Finance Director, Group Chief Executive 
Officer (CEO) and external Auditor attend 
by invitation. The Audit Committee makes 
recommendations to the Board on issues 
surrounding the appointment, resignation or 
removal of auditors and their remuneration.  
It discusses and agrees the scope of the audit 
with the external Auditor before the audit. 
The Audit Committee reviews external audit 
activities, monitors compliance with statutory 
requirements for financial reporting and reviews 
the half-year and annual accounts before they 
are presented to the Board for approval. It is 
also required to review the effectiveness of 
the Group’s internal control systems, to review 
the Group’s statement on internal control 
systems prior to endorsement by the Board 
and to consider, from time to time, the need 
for a risk assessment of the Group’s internal 
control systems.
Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee comprises the 
Chairman, the Non-Executive Director and, by 
invitation, the Group CEO and the Company 
Secretary. It is responsible for recommending to 
the Board the contract terms, remuneration and 
other benefits for Executive Directors, including 
the performance-related bonus scheme and 
participation in the Group’s long-term share 
option schemes.
The Board has not delegated a Nomination 
Committee; the whole Board is involved in the 
appointment of any new director.
The Board does not currently undertake an 
evaluation of its own performance or that of its 
committees.
Accountability
The Board meets at least four times each 
year and has adopted a formal schedule of 
matters specifically reserved for decision by 
it, thus ensuring that it exercises control over 
appropriate strategic, financial, operational 
and compliance issues. At these meetings 
the Board reviews trading performance, 
ensures adequate financing, sets and monitors 
strategy, examines investment and acquisition 
opportunities and discusses reports to 
Shareholders. 
Internal controls
The Board has overall responsibility for the 
Group’s system of internal controls. However, 
such a system is designed to manage rather 
than eliminate the risk of failure to achieve 
business objectives and can only provide 
reasonable and not absolute assurance against 
material misstatement. In order to discharge 
that responsibility in a manner which ensures 
compliance with laws and regulations and 
promotes effective and efficient operations, 
the Directors have established an organisation 
structure with clear operating procedures, 
lines of responsibility and delegated authority. 
There is an established framework of internal 
controls set out and approved by the executive 
management. The more important elements of 
this framework are as follows:
• Management structure
The Board has overall responsibility for 
the Group and each Executive Director 
has been given responsibility for specific 
aspects of the Group’s affairs.
• Corporate accounting and procedures 
Responsibility levels are communicated 
throughout the Group as part of the 
corporate communication procedure. 
Accounting, delegation of authority and 
authorisation levels, segregation of duties 
and other control procedures, together with 
the general ethos of the Group are included 
in these communications, and standardised 
accounting policies are in place reflecting 
this policy.
• Quality and integrity of personnel
The integrity and competence of personnel 
is ensured through high recruitment 
standards and subsequent training 
courses. Quality personnel are seen as an 
essential part of the control environment 
and the ethical standards expected are 
communicated through senior members 
of staff. www.dillistonegroup.com 19
• Budgetary process 
Each year the Board approves the annual 
budget, which includes an assessment of 
key assumptions underlying it. Performance 
is monitored and relevant action taken 
throughout the year by monthly reporting 
to the Board of updated forecasts together 
with information on key risk areas.
• Internal monitoring
The Audit Committee considers and 
determines relevant action in respect 
of any control issues raised by the 
Auditor. Given the size of the Group and 
the close day-to-day control exercised 
by the Executive Directors and senior 
management, no formal financial internal 
audit department is considered necessary. 
The Operations Director is responsible for 
maintaining registrations and quality related 
certifications and defining and agreeing the 
procedures, standards and practices to be 
followed in all non-financial aspects of the 
Group’s business.
• Risk management
The Board formally reviews the risk register 
at least annually and the consideration of 
risks and in particular the identification 
of new risks are an agenda item at each 
Board meeting.
• Relationship with Company Auditor
The Auditor has ready access to the 
chairman of the Audit Committee and the 
Audit Committee meets at least annually 
with the Auditor without any member of the 
executive being present.
Remuneration
The objective of the Group’s remuneration policy 
is to attract, motivate, and retain high quality 
individuals who will contribute significantly 
to shareholder value. The Remuneration 
Committee decides on the remuneration of 
the Directors and other senior management, 
which comprises a basic salary, benefits, 
bonus scheme, share options and longer-term 
incentive plan.
No Director is involved in deciding his or her 
own remuneration.
Relations with Shareholders 
The Group seeks to maintain good 
communications with Shareholders.  
The Executive Directors make presentations to 
institutional Shareholders covering the interim 
and full year results. The Group despatches 
the notice of Annual General Meetings (AGM), 
with an explanatory circular describing items 
of special business, at least 21 working days 
before the meeting. All Shareholders have 
the opportunity formally or informally to ask 
questions at the Company’s AGM and the 
Chairman typically makes a statement on 
current trading conditions at that meeting. 
The Chairman of the Audit and Remuneration 
Committees attends the AGM and will answer 
questions that may be relevant to the remit of 
those committees. At each AGM the Chairman 
advises Shareholders of the proxy voting details 
on each of the resolutions, which are dealt 
with on a show of hands. In addition, webinars 
are made following certain announcements as 
well as ad hoc meetings, giving Shareholders 
and other interested parties the opportunity to 
interact with members of the Board.
Auditor
A resolution authorising the Directors to set 
the remuneration of the Auditor will be put to 
Shareholders at the forthcoming AGM.

REPORT TO THE SHAREHOLDERS  
ON DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION
For the year ended 31 December 2017
Service contracts
The Board’s policy is that service contracts of Executive Directors should provide for termination by the Group on one year’s notice. The service 
contracts of each of the current Executive Directors provide for such a period of notice.
The independent Non-Executive Directors have letters of appointment providing fixed three-year service periods, which may be terminated by giving six 
months’ notice.
Non-Executive Directors’ remuneration
The fees for the Chairman and independent Non-Executive Director are determined by the Board. The Chairman and the Non-Executive Director are 
not involved in any discussions or decisions about their own remuneration.
The Chairman and independent Non-Executive Director do not receive bonuses or pension contributions and are not entitled to participate in any 
of the Group’s share schemes. They are entitled to be reimbursed the reasonable expenses incurred by them in carrying out their duties as Directors of 
the Company.
Executive Directors’ remuneration
The remuneration package of the Executive Directors includes the following elements:
Basic salary 
Salaries are normally reviewed annually taking into account inflation and salaries paid to directors of comparable companies. Pay reviews also take into 
account Group and personal performance. The Board as a whole decides the remuneration of the Chairman and the Non-Executive Director.
Performance related pay scheme
There are two performance related pay schemes for Executive Directors. The first is an annual bonus scheme which is based upon the achievement 
of certain profit and commercial targets for the Group, as appropriate. The Executive Directors’ bonus charged in the 2017 financial year is £17,000 
(2016: £35,000) including Employer’s National Insurance. 
The second scheme is a long-term incentive plan linked to growth in earnings per share over a three year period. At the discretion of the Remuneration 
Committee, Executive Directors are either granted share options at the ruling mid-market price at the time of the grant or a pure cash bonus fixed as a 
percentage of salary. The awards are subject to meeting challenging EPS growth targets. Annual awards are made under this scheme. Where options 
are awarded, the value of the award is calculated using a Black–Scholes model (see note 23 for further details). The awards made in the period are 
included in the LTIP tables below.

Directors’ responsibilities
The Directors are responsible for preparing the 
Directors’ Report and the financial statements 
in accordance with applicable law and 
regulations.
Company law requires the Directors to prepare 
financial statements for each financial year. The 
Directors are also required to prepare financial 
statements in accordance with the rules of the 
London Stock Exchange for companies trading 
on the Alternative Investment Market. The 
Directors have elected under company law to 
prepare the Group and Company’s financial 
statements in accordance with International 
Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by 
the European Union (IFRSs). Under company 
law the Directors must not approve the financial 
statements unless they are satisfied that they 
give a true and fair view of the state of affairs 
and profit or loss of the Group and Company for 
that period. 
In preparing the Group and Company financial 
statements, the Directors are required to:
• select suitable accounting policies and then 
apply them consistently;
• make judgements and accounting 
estimates that are reasonable and prudent;
• state whether they have been prepared in 
accordance with IFRSs adopted by the EU;
• prepare the financial statements on 
the going concern basis unless it is 
inappropriate to presume that the Group 
and the Company will continue in business.
The Directors are responsible for keeping 
adequate accounting records that are 
sufficient to show and explain the Company’s 
transactions and disclose with reasonable 
accuracy at any time the financial position 
of the Company and enable them to ensure 
that the financial statements comply with the 
Companies Act 2006. They are also responsible 
for safeguarding the assets of the Company 
and hence for taking reasonable steps for the 
prevention and detection of fraud and other 
irregularities.
Website publication
The Directors are responsible for ensuring the 
Annual Report and the financial statements 
are made available on a website. Financial 
statements are published on the Company’s 
website in accordance with legislation in the 
United Kingdom governing the preparation 
and dissemination of financial statements, 
which may vary from legislation in other 
jurisdictions. The maintenance and integrity of 
the Company’s website is the responsibility of 
the Directors. The Directors’ responsibility also 
extends to the ongoing integrity of the financial 
statements contained therein.
The Directors confirm that so far as each 
Director is aware:
• there is no relevant audit information of 
which the Company’s Auditor is unaware; 
and
• the Directors have taken all steps that they 
ought to have taken as Directors to make 
themselves aware of any relevant audit 
information and to establish that the Auditor 
is aware of that information.

Independent Auditor’s Report
to the members of Dillistone Group Plc 
For the year ended 31 December 2017
Opinion
We have audited the financial statements of Dillistone Group Plc (the ‘parent company’) and its subsidiaries (the ‘group’) for the year ended 31 
December 2017 which comprise the consolidated statement of comprehensive income, the consolidated and company statement of changes in 
equity, the consolidated and company statement of financial position, the consolidated and company cash flow statement; and notes to the financial 
statements, including a summary of significant accounting policies. 
The financial reporting framework that has been applied in the preparation of the financial statements is applicable law and International Financial 
Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union and as regards the parent company financial statements, as applied in accordance 
with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006.
In our opinion:
• the financial statements give a true and fair view of the state of the group’s and of the parent company’s affairs as at 31 December 2017 and of the 
group’s loss for the year then ended;
• the group financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union;
• the parent company financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union and as 
applied in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006; and
• the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006.
Basis for opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK) (ISAs (UK)) and applicable law. Our responsibilities under those 
standards are further described in the Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements section of our report. We are independent of 
the group in accordance with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the financial statements in the UK, including the FRC’s Ethical 
Standard as applied to listed entities, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements. We believe that the 
audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.
Conclusions relating to going concern
We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters in relation to which the ISAs (UK) require us to report to you where:
• the directors’ use of the going concern basis of accounting in the preparation of the financial statements is not appropriate; or
• the directors have not disclosed in the financial statements any identified material uncertainties that may cast significant doubt about the group’s 
or the parent company’s ability to continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting for a period of at least twelve months from the date 
when the financial statements are authorised for issue.
Overview
Materiality
Audit scope
Areas of 
focus
Group materiality was £143,000 (2016: £150,000), which represents 1.50% (2016: 1.50%) of total revenue. Component 
materiality and other considerations are detailed in the materiality section below. 
We identified five centrally controlled components (either those operations required to have individual audit opinions issued 
under the Companies Act 2006, or those that contributed greater than 15% of group revenue), which, in our view, required an 
audit of their complete financial information.
Further review procedures were performed on both centrally and foreign controlled operations in the US by the group audit 
team at the group's head office. BDO network component auditors were engaged to perform specific audit procedures on the 
operations located in Australia.
We have identified and reported on two key audit matters, including Capitalised Development and Revenue Recognition (as 
detailed below).  www.dillistonegroup.com 25
STRATEGIC  
REPORT
FINANCIAL 
STATEMENTS
Key audit matters
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement, were of most significance in our audit of the financial statements of the  
current period and include the most significant assessed risks of material misstatement (whether or not due to fraud) we identified, including those 
which had the greatest effect on: the overall audit strategy, the allocation of resources in the audit; and directing the efforts of the engagement team.  
These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not 
provide a separate opinion on these matters.  
Key audit matter Description of key audit matter Our response
Capitalised 
development costs
Recognition of internally developed intangible assets was 
considered to be a key audit matter, given the involvement of 
significant judgement, including: 
• Determining the distinction between research and 
development costs; and
• Determining the value of salary costs relating to 
members not in the development team to be capitalised.
Management have also utilised significant judgement in 
assessing the technological and commercial feasibility of the 
projects.
As described in note 1.12, the group capitalises costs 
incurred on product development relating to the design and 
development of new or enhanced products. Details of the 
products concerned are given in the “Dillistone Group at a 
Glance” section of the annual report on pages 04 and 05.
Our audit procedures involved: 
• Making enquiries of “Heads of Development” within the 
group to understand procedures performed to capitalise 
internally generated intangible assets. 
• Reviewing all project summary reports for all ongoing and 
completed projects during the year for which costs were 
capitalised. 
• Consideration of management’s assessment of technical 
feasibility.
• Where appropriate, confirmation of the existence of an 
active market through consideration of sales activity.
• For a sample of capitalised payroll costs, obtained and 
reviewed employment contracts and timecards.
Recognition of 
revenue 
The group’s revenue recognition policy can be found in note 
1.4 to the financial statements.
We consider a significant risk of material misstatement to 
arise from the recognition of revenue around the year end. 
Further, the offering of bonus schemes and incentive plans 
increases the risk that sales may be overstated due to fraud. 
Therefore the key audit matter is the existence of revenue 
around the year end, including the recognition of the correct 
apportionment of revenue in the year and the related amount 
deferred at the year end.
We tested that consistent revenue recognition procedures 
have been adopted during the year by reviewing a selection of 
contracts, tracing the satisfaction of performance obligations, 
cash receipts and revenue postings into the income statement.
We performed testing over all material revenue streams, 
including: 
•  Applying predictive analytical testing procedures for 
contract revenue earned during the year and investigated 
all movements that were not consistent with independent 
expectations set. All inputs used to set those expectations 
were tested substantively.
• Verifying a sample of bespoke and non-recurring orders 
received in the year, reconciling to underlying agreements, 
cash receipt and appropriate trigger events for revenue 
recognition.
• Selecting a sample of entries deferred at year end, tracing 
these back to the cash receipt and expected delivery of 
performance obligations. 
• Reviewing a sample of revenue items posted either side of 
year end to confirm revenue cut-off procedures have been 
correctly applied.

Independent Auditor’s Report continued
to the members of Dillistone Group Plc 
For the year ended 31 December 2017
Our application of materiality
We apply the concept of materiality in performing our audit and evaluating the effect of misstatements. We consider materiality to be the magnitude 
by which misstatements, including omissions, could influence the economic decisions of reasonable users that are taken on the basis of the financial 
statements. 
In order to reduce to an appropriately low level the probability that any misstatements exceed materiality, we use a lower materiality, performance 
materiality, to determine the extent of testing needed. Importantly, misstatements below these levels will not necessarily be evaluated as immaterial as 
we also take account of the nature of identified misstatements, and the particular circumstances of their occurrence, when evaluating their effect on 
the financial statements as a whole. 
We agreed with the audit committee that we would report to the committee all individual audit differences identified during the course of our audit in 
excess of £7,150 (2016: £7,500). We also agreed to report differences below these thresholds that, in our view, warranted reporting on qualitative 
grounds.
Overall group materiality £143,000 (2016: £150,000)
Basis for determining 1.50% of total group revenue (2016: 1.50%)
Rationale for benchmark applied The ability of the group to generate continued and new sources of revenue is imperative for management to 
conclude on the market feasibility of software projects and the ability to capitalised costs in accordance with IAS 
38. Furthermore, as a significant driver of profit, revenue growth impacts the achievement of key performance 
indicators resulting in bonus schemes and incentive plans offered by the group.

We determined component materiality as follows: 
Range of component materiality 3% to 93% (2016: 2% to 80%) of group materiality www.dillistonegroup.com 27
An overview of the scope of our audit
Our group audit was scoped by obtaining an understanding of the group and its environment, including the group’s system of internal control, and 
assessing the risks of material misstatement in the financial statements at the group level. 
In determining the scope of our audit we considered the level of work to be performed at each component in order to ensure sufficient assurance was 
gained to allow us to express an opinion on the financial statements of the Group as a whole. We tailored the extent of the work to be performed at 
each component, either by us, as the group audit team or component auditors within the BDO International network, based on our assessment of the 
risk of material misstatement at each component. We identified five centrally controlled components as significant, and have audited these for group 
reporting purposes.
The group audit team centrally performed the audit of 82% (2016: 85%) of group revenue and 95% (2016: 89%) of total assets using the materiality 
levels set out above. 
For two of the components not considered significant, the component auditors performed specific scope procedures based on their relative size, risks 
in the business and our knowledge of those entities appropriate to respond to the risk of material misstatement. Review and specific scope procedures 
were performed by the group audit team on the remaining three reporting components not considered significant to the group.

financial statements and our auditor’s report thereon. Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and, except to the 
extent otherwise explicitly stated in our report, we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.
In connection with our audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the 
other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially 
misstated. If we identify such material inconsistencies or apparent material misstatements, we are required to determine whether there is a material 
misstatement in the financial statements or a material misstatement of the other information. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude 
that there is a material misstatement of this other information; we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard.
Opinions on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006
In our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of the audit:
• the information given in the strategic report and the directors’ report for the financial year for which the financial statements are prepared is 
consistent with the financial statements; and
• the strategic report and the directors’ report have been prepared in accordance with applicable legal requirements.

to the members of Dillistone Group Plc 
For the year ended 31 December 2017
Matters on which we are required to report by exception
In the light of the knowledge and understanding of the group and the parent company and its environment obtained in the course of the audit, we have 
not identified material misstatements in the strategic report or the directors’ report.
We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters in relation to which the Companies Act 2006 requires us to report to you if, in our opinion:
• adequate accounting records have not been kept by the parent company, or returns adequate for our audit have not been received from branches 
not visited by us; or
• the parent company financial statements are not in agreement with the accounting records and returns; or
• certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration specified by law are not made; or 
• we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit.
Responsibilities of directors
As explained more fully in the directors’ responsibilities statement set out on page 22, the directors are responsible for the preparation of the financial 
statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view, and for such internal control as the directors determine is necessary to enable the 
preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
In preparing the financial statements, the directors are responsible for assessing the group’s and the parent company’s ability to continue as a going 
concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the directors either intend 
to liquidate the group or the parent company or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.
Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements
This report is made solely to the company’s members, as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006. Our audit work 
has been undertaken so that we might state to the company’s members those matters we are required to state to them in an auditor’s report and for no 
other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the company and the company’s 
members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due 
to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee 
that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs (UK) will always detect a material misstatement when it exists.
Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to 
influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.
A further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements is located on the Financial Reporting Council’s website at: 
www.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities. This description forms part of our auditor’s report.

Notes to the Financial Statements
For the year ended 31 December 2017
Dillistone Group Plc (the ‘Company’) is a company incorporated in England and Wales. The financial statements are presented in thousand Pounds 
Sterling. The principal activities have been detailed in the Strategic Report and the registered office is 50 Leman St, London, E1 8HQ.
The Group financial statements consolidate those of the Company and its subsidiaries (together referred to as the ‘Group’). The parent company 
financial statements present information about the Company as a separate entity and not about its Group.
Both the Group financial statements and the Company financial statements have been prepared and approved by the Directors in accordance with 
International Financial Reporting Standards (’IFRS’) as adopted by the European Union (’EU’), IFRIC Interpretations and the Companies Act 2006 
applicable to companies reporting under IFRS. In publishing the Company financial statements here together with the Group financial statements, the 
Company has taken advantage of the exemption in s408 of the Companies Act 2006 not to present its individual income statement and related notes 
in these financial statements.
1. Accounting policies
1.1 Basis of accounting
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared using the significant accounting policies and measurement bases summarised below: 
Significant estimates
In the application of the Group’s accounting policies the Directors are required to make estimates and assumptions about the carrying amounts of 
assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. The estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience 
and other factors that are considered to be relevant. Actual results may differ from these estimates.
The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which 
the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period, or in the period of the revision and future periods if the revision affects both current and 
future periods. The key areas are summarised below:
Capitalisation and amortisation of internal development expenditure
Management exercises judgement in establishing both the technical feasibility of completing an intangible asset which can be used internally or sold 
and the degree of certainty that a market exists for the asset, or its output, for the generation of future economic benefits. In addition, amortisation 
rates are based on estimates of the useful economic lives and residual values of the assets involved. The assessment of these useful economic lives is 
made by projecting the economic lifecycle of the asset which is subject to alteration as a result of product development and innovation. Amortisation 
rates are changed where economic lives are re-assessed and technically obsolete items written off where necessary. The carrying value of capitalised 
development is reviewed for impairment indicators at each accounting period end. See note 13. In addition, management use a best estimate to 
determine the amount of Directors’ costs that are capitalised.
Impairment of goodwill, other intangible assets and investments
There are a number of assumptions management has considered in performing impairment reviews of goodwill, other intangible assets and 
investments which include an estimate of the future cash flows expected to arise from the cash generating unit and a suitable discount rate in order to 
calculate the recoverable amount. See notes 12, 13 and 15.
Valuation of assets and liabilities
Management has made a number of assumptions with regards to the models used to value assets and liabilities at the statement of financial position 
date. Valuation techniques commonly used by market practitioners are applied. In respect of the provision for bad and doubtful receivables and credit 
note provisions, management has made relevant judgements based on discussions with the account managers as regards the recoverability of trade 
receivables. See note 17.
Valuation of separately identifiable intangible assets
As detailed in note 1.8, separately identifiable intangible assets are identified and amortised over a defined period. The Directors use acknowledged 
approaches eg: relief from royalty method, capital asset pricing model, excess earnings valuation method but these are reliant upon certain judgements 
and assumptions which they determine are reasonable by reference to companies in similar industries.
Valuation of share-based payments
The estimation of share-based payment costs requires the selection of an appropriate valuation model and consideration as to the inputs necessary for 
the valuation model chosen. The Group has made estimates as to the volatility of its own shares, the probable life of options granted, leaver rates and 
the time of exercise of those options. The model used by the Group is a Black-Scholes valuation model. Further details are shown in note 23.
Judgements in applying the Group’s accounting policies
In the process of applying the Group’s accounting policies, management makes various judgements that can significantly affect the amounts 
recognised in the financial statements. The critical judgements are considered to be the following:

Notes to the Financial Statements continued
For the year ended 31 December 2017
1. Accounting policies (continued)
Customers’ practical acceptance of licence software
As detailed in note 1.4, perpetual licence fee revenues are recognised on practical acceptance of the software. The Group uses the ‘live’ date as the 
basis of determining the timing of customer practical acceptance, thereby reducing the judgement required to ascertain the timing of licence revenue 
recognition.
Capitalisation of internal development expenditure
Management exercises judgement in establishing both the technical feasibility of completing an intangible asset which can be used internally or sold 
and the degree of certainty that a market exists for the asset, or its output, for the generation of future economic benefits. See ‘Capitalisation and 
amortisation of internal development expenditure’ in Significant estimates above for further details.
The accounting policies set out below have, unless otherwise stated, been applied consistently by the Group to all periods presented in these financial 
statements.
1.2 Going concern
The Group’s business activities and financial position, together with the factors likely to affect its future development, performance and position, are 
set out in the CEO’s Review and Financial Review on pages 8 to 14. In addition, note 25 to the financial statements includes the Company’s objectives, 
policies and processes for managing its capital; its financial risk management objectives; details of its financial instruments; and its exposures to credit 
risk and liquidity risk. The Group prepare budgets and cashflow forecasts to ensure that the Group can meet its liabilities as they fall due.
The Group has considerable financial resources together with well established relationships with a number of customers and suppliers across different 
geographic areas. In addition a substantial proportion of its revenue is recurring.
As a consequence, the Directors believe that the Company is well placed to manage its business risks successfully despite the current uncertain 
economic outlook.
The Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Company has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for at least 12 months 
from the date of approval of these financial statements. Thus they continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing the annual 
financial statements.  
1.3 Basis of consolidation
The Group financial statements consolidate those of the parent company and all of its subsidiaries as of 31 December 2017. The parent controls a 
subsidiary if it is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the subsidiary and has the ability to affect those returns through its 
power over the subsidiary. All subsidiaries have a reporting date of 31 December.
All transactions and balances between Group companies are eliminated on consolidation, including unrealised gains and losses on transactions 
between Group companies. Where unrealised losses on intra-group asset sales are reversed on consolidation, the underlying asset is also tested for 
impairment from a Group perspective. Amounts reported in the financial statements of subsidiaries have been adjusted where necessary to ensure 
consistency with the accounting policies adopted by the Group.
Profit or loss and other comprehensive income of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the year are recognised from the effective date of 
acquisition, or up to the effective date of disposal, as applicable.
1.4 Revenue 
General
Revenue to be recognised is the fair value of the total amount receivable by the Group for supplies of licences and services. VAT or similar local taxes 
and trade discounts are excluded.
Licencing (excluding Software as a Service “SaaS”)
The Group licenses software under licence agreements. Perpetual licence fee revenues are recognised on practical acceptance of the software, when 
all obligations have been substantially completed. This is when the customer has accepted the product ie the “live” date, the risks and rewards of 
ownership have been transferred, it is probable that the economic benefits of the transaction will flow to the Group, all costs and revenue in relation 
to the transaction can reliably be measured and the Group has no further managerial involvement over the goods to the degree usually associated 
with ownership. To the extent that payments have been received in advance for licences, where practical acceptance has not yet been reached, these 
amounts are recognised as deferred income.
Professional services (including installation and training)
The Group provides professional services which include installation, consulting, data translation and training. Such revenues are recognised as the 
services are completed or, where they are part of the sale and installation of software, they are typically recognised when the obligations under the 
contract are complete. To the extent that payments have been received in advance for such services these amounts are recognised as deferred 
income.  www.dillistonegroup.com 37
1. Accounting policies (continued)
Product support, hosting and SaaS
Revenues from support, hosting or SaaS agreements are recognised over the period to which they relate but only after practical acceptance of the 
software, as defined above, has been received. The contractual arrangements normally separate out and apportion a value to each deliverable and 
this value is an approximation of the fair value of the deliverable. Where revenue is invoiced in advance for such services, the amount in advance is 
included in deferred revenue and released over the period to which the service relates. 
Third party revenues
The Group sells, predominantly as principal, software developed by other organisations together with services that are bought in from third parties. 
Sales of third party software are recognised in the period in which the sale occurs. Services are recognised in the period in which they are provided. 
Tokens
The Group sells tokens to access certain services within the business. Tokens are normally bought in bundles and can be used over time.  
Tokens have a fixed expiry period after which the customer has no legally enforceable right to claim on the tokens, and hence all risks & rewards have 
been transferred and performance obligations have been fulfilled. Revenue is recognised on use or on expiry of the tokens.
1.5 Share based payments
The Company operates a share based payment scheme. 
It is an equity settled share-based compensation plan (share options) for remuneration of its employees. 
All employee services received in exchange for the grant of any share-based compensation are measured at their fair values. These are determined by 
reference to the share option awarded. Their value is appraised at the grant date and excludes the impact of any non-market vesting conditions (e.g. 
profitability or sales growth targets). 
All equity-settled share-based compensation is ultimately recognised as an expense in the profit or loss with a corresponding credit to share based 
payment reserve, net of deferred tax where applicable. If vesting periods or other vesting conditions apply, the expense is allocated over the vesting 
period, based on the best available estimate of the number of shares options expected to vest. Non market vesting conditions are included in 
assumptions about the number of options that are expected to become exercisable. Estimates are subsequently revised if there is any indication that 
the number of share options expected to vest differs from previous estimates. No adjustment to expenses recognised in prior periods is made if fewer 
share options ultimately are exercised than originally estimated.
Upon exercise of share options, the proceeds received, net of any directly attributable transaction costs, up to the nominal value of the shares issued 
are reallocated to share capital with any excess being recorded as additional share premium.
1.6 Long term incentive plan (“LTIP”) – capped cash bonus
The LTIP awards can be share based or cash based. The cash awards are based on a capped cash bonus with performance conditions related to the 
growth in earnings per share of the Group. These awards automatically mature following the publication of the Annual Report of the Company, three 
years after the period to which the grant relates. The liability is accrued and recognised in the statement of comprehensive income.
1.7 Long term incentive plan (“LTIP”) – share option based award
The LTIP awards can be share based or cash based. The number of share option granted under these awards are based on a percentage of salary with 
performance conditions related to the growth in earnings per share of the Group. These awards can be exercised between three and ten years after the 
date of the grant. This element is accrued and recognised in the statement of comprehensive income.
1.8 Business combinations
The Group applies the acquisition method in accounting for business combinations. The consideration transferred by the Group to obtain control of 
a subsidiary is calculated as the sum of the acquisition-date fair values of assets transferred, liabilities incurred and the equity interests issued by the 
Group, which includes the fair value of any asset or liability arising from a contingent consideration arrangement. Acquisition costs are expensed as 
incurred.
The Group recognises identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination regardless of whether they have been previously 
recognised in the acquiree’s financial statements prior to the acquisition. Assets acquired and liabilities assumed are generally measured at their 
acquisition-date fair values. Goodwill is stated after separate recognition of identifiable intangible assets. It is calculated as the excess of the sum of:
a) fair value of consideration transferred, 
b)  the recognised amount of any non-controlling interest in the acquiree and 
c) acquisition-date fair value of any existing equity interest in the acquiree, over the acquisition-date fair values of identifiable net assets. If the fair 
values of identifiable net assets exceed the sum calculated above, the excess amount (ie gain on a bargain purchase) is recognised in profit or loss 
immediately. 
Where contingent consideration relates to the results spread over different accounting periods, the fair value of such consideration is recalculated at 
each year end and any adjustment is recognised in profit or loss immediately.

1. Accounting policies (continued)
1.9 Adjusted operating profit
Adjusted operating profit excludes acquisition costs and related intangible amortisation and movements in contingent consideration and other one-off 
costs which can include, as an example, the additional amortisation charge required in re-estimating the useful economic life of an intangible asset.
1.10 Impairment testing of goodwill, other intangible assets and property, plant and equipment
For impairment assessment purposes, assets are grouped at the lowest levels for which there are largely independent cash inflows (cash generating 
units). As a result, some assets are tested individually for impairment and some are tested at cash generating unit level. Goodwill is allocated to those 
cash generating units that are expected to benefit from synergies of the related business combination and represent the lowest level within the Group 
at which management monitors goodwill. Cash generating units to which goodwill has been allocated are tested for impairment at least annually.  
All other individual assets or cash generating units are tested for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying 
amount may not be recoverable.
An impairment loss is recognised for the amount by which the asset’s or cash generating unit’s carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount, 
which is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value-in-use. To determine the value-in-use, management estimates expected future cash flows 
from each cash generating unit and determines a suitable interest rate in order to calculate the present value of those cash flows. The data used 
for impairment testing procedures are directly linked to the Group’s latest approved budget, adjusted as necessary to exclude the effects of future 
reorganisations and asset enhancements. Discount factors are determined individually for each cash generating unit and reflect management’s 
assessment of respective risk profiles, such as market and asset-specific risks factors. Impairment losses for cash generating units reduce first the 
carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to that cash generating unit. Any remaining impairment loss is charged pro rata to the other assets in 
the cash generating unit. With the exception of goodwill, all assets are subsequently reassessed for indications that an impairment loss previously 
recognised may no longer exist. An impairment charge is reversed if the cash generating unit’s recoverable amount exceeds its carrying amount.
1.11 Segment reporting
Operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to the chief operating decision-maker. The chief operating 
decision-maker, who is responsible for allocating resources and assessing performance of the operating segments, has been identified as the Board of 
Directors.
1.12 Intangible assets
Internal development costs
Costs incurred on product development relating to the design and development of new or enhanced products are capitalised as intangible assets when 
it is reasonably certain that the development will provide economic benefits, considering its commercial and technological feasibility and the resources 
available for the completion and marketing of the development, and where the costs can be measured reliably. The expenditures capitalised are the 
direct labour costs and subcontractor costs, which are managed and controlled centrally. Product development costs previously recognised as an 
expense are not recognised as an asset in a subsequent period.
Capitalised product development expenditure is amortised over its useful life of five years, with amortisation commencing in the month of costs being 
incurred. Maintenance costs are expensed. Amortisation of new products commences once a product is available for use.
Capitalised product development expenditure is subject to regular impairment reviews and is stated at cost less any accumulated impairment losses. 
Any impairment taken during the year is shown under administrative expenses on the statement of comprehensive income. Development costs that do 
not meet the requirements for capitalisation are written off to profit and loss as incurred. In accordance with IAS 38, no research costs are capitalised 
to the balance sheet, but are expensed as incurred.
Purchased Software
Software acquired externally is capitalised when it is expected to have ongoing use within the business. Capitalised expenditure includes both the 
purchase price and any costs directly associated with bringing the software into use. Amortisation is charged over the useful economic life of the 
software, typically 3 to 5 years, beginning when it is capable of being used by the business.
Acquired as part of a business combination
In accordance with IFRS 3 Business Combinations, an intangible asset acquired in a business combination is deemed to have a cost to the Group of 
its fair value at the acquisition date. The fair value of the intangible asset reflects market expectations about the probability that the future economic 
benefits embodied in the asset will flow to the Group. Where an intangible asset might be separable, but only together with a related tangible or 
intangible asset, the Group of assets is recognised as a single asset separately from goodwill where the individual fair values of the assets in the Group 
are not reliably measurable. Where the individual fair values of the complementary assets are reliably measurable, the Group recognises them as a 
single asset provided the individual assets have similar useful lives. www.dillistonegroup.com 39
1. Accounting policies (continued)
Subsequent to initial recognition, intangible assets are reported at cost less accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses. 
Amortisation is provided to write off the cost of each intangible asset over its useful economic life as follows:
Intangible assets: Estimated life
Brand and IP 15 years
Acquired developed technology 6–11.25 years
Contractual customer relationships 1.25 years
Non-contractual customer relationships 6–10.25 years
The useful economic life of intangible assets are reviewed annually. The Group has reviewed its useful economic life in respect of non contractual 
relationships following the loss of a major contract in one part of the business. See note 13.
1.13 Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation on these assets is provided at rates estimated to write off 
the cost, less estimated residual value, of each asset over its expected useful life as follows:
Leasehold land and buildings the lower of 5 years or the remaining lease period
Office and computer equipment 3–5 years straight line
Fixtures, fittings and equipment 4–5 years straight line
1.14 Financial assets
The Group classifies its financial assets under the definitions provided in International Accounting Standard 39 (IAS 39) Financial Instruments: 
Recognition and Measurement, depending on the purpose for which the financial assets were acquired. Management determines the classification of 
its financial assets at initial recognition. Management considers that the Group’s financial assets fall under the ‘loans and receivables’ category.
Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determined payments that are not quoted in an active market. They are included 
in current assets, except for maturities greater than 12 months after the statement of financial position date, which are classified as non-current assets. 
The Group’s loans and receivables comprise trade receivables, intercompany trading balances (in relation to Company accounts), and cash and cash 
equivalents.
Trade receivables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method, less 
any provision for impairment. Receivables are considered for impairment when they are past due or when other objective evidence is received that a 
specific counterparty may default. Receivables that are not considered to be individually impaired are reviewed for impairment in groups.  
The impairment loss estimate is then based on recent historical counterparty default rates and current economic conditions. 
Derecognition of financial assets occurs when the rights to receive cash flows from the investments expire or are transferred and substantially all of 
the risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred. An assessment for impairment is undertaken at least at each statement of financial position 
date whether or not there is objective evidence that a financial asset or a group of financial assets is impaired.
1.15 Financial liabilities
Other financial liabilities are classified under the definitions provided in IAS 39, either as financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss, or 
financial liabilities measured at amortised cost. Management considers that the Group’s other financial liabilities fall under the ‘financial liabilities 
measured at amortised cost’ category other than contingent consideration which is measured at fair value and movements in fair value are recognised 
in the profit or loss. The Group’s other ‘financial liabilities measured at amortised cost’ comprise trade payables, intercompany trading balances  
(in relation to Company accounts), bank loans and accruals.
Trade and other payables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
1.16 Convertible loan notes
The proceeds received on issue of the Group’s convertible loan note are allocated into their liability and equity components. The amount initially 
attributed to the debt component equals the discounted cash flows using a market rate of interest that would be payable on a similar debt instrument 
that does not include an option to convert. Subsequently, the debt component is accounted for as a financial liability measured at amortised cost until 
extinguished on conversion or maturity of the loan note. The remainder of the proceeds is allocated to the conversion option and is recognised in the 
‘Convertible loan note reserve’ within Shareholders’ equity, net of income tax effects.

1.17 Investments
Investments in subsidiary companies are included at cost in the accounts of the Company less any amount written off in respect of any impairment  
in value.
1.18 Leases
Leases taken by the Group are assessed individually as to whether they are finance leases or operating leases. Leases are classified as finance leases 
whenever the terms of the lease transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership to the lessee. All other leases are classified as operating 
leases.
Operating lease rental payments are recognised as an expense in the income statement on a straight-line basis over the lease term. The benefit of 
lease incentives is spread over the term of the lease.
1.19 Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost includes all directly attributable expenses. Costs of ordinarily interchangeable 
items are assigned using the first in, first out cost formula. Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business less any 
applicable selling expenses.
1.20 Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents includes cash in hand, deposits held at call with banks and other short-term highly liquid investments with original 
maturities of three months or less and which are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value.
1.21 Equity
Equity comprises the following:
• ‘Share capital’ represents the nominal value of equity shares.
• ‘Share premium’ represents the excess over nominal value of the fair value of consideration received for equity shares, net of expenses of the share 
issue.
• ‘Merger reserve’ is used where more than 90% of the shares in a subsidiary are acquired and the consideration includes the issue of new shares 
by the Company, thereby attracting merger relief under the Companies Act 2006.
• ‘Convertible loan note reserve’ represents the equity element arising on the issue of a loan note with rights to an equity conversion.
• ‘Share option reserve’ represents equity-settled share-based employee and non-employee remuneration until such share options are exercised.
• ‘Retained earnings’ represents retained profits and losses.
• ‘Translation reserve’ represents translation differences arising on the consolidation of investments in overseas subsidiaries.
1.22 Foreign currency translation
The consolidated financial statements are presented in Sterling, which is also the functional currency of the parent Company.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated into functional currency at the rates of exchange ruling at the 
statement of financial position date. Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded at the rate ruling at the date of the transaction. All differences are 
taken to profit and loss.
On consolidation, the assets and liabilities of the Group’s overseas subsidiaries are translated from their functional currency to Sterling at exchange 
rates prevailing on the statement of financial position date. Income and expenses have been translated from their functional currency into Sterling at 
the average rate for each month over the reporting period. Exchange differences are charged/credited to other comprehensive income and recognised 
in the currency translation reserve in equity.
On disposal of a foreign entity, the deferred cumulative amount recognised in equity relating to that particular foreign operation is recognised in the 
income statement. www.dillistonegroup.com 41
1. Accounting policies (continued)
1.23 Income taxes
Current income tax assets and liabilities comprise those obligations to fiscal authorities in the countries in which the Group carries out its operations. 
They are calculated according to the tax rates and tax laws applicable to the fiscal period and the country to which they relate. Tax expense recognised 
in profit or loss comprises the sum of deferred tax and current tax not recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity. 
Deferred income taxes are calculated using the liability method on temporary differences. This involves the comparison of the carrying amount of 
assets and liabilities in the consolidated financial statements with their respective tax bases. However, deferred tax is not provided on the initial 
recognition of goodwill, or on the initial recognition of an asset or liability unless the related transaction is a business combination or affects tax or 
accounting profit. Deferred tax on temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries is not provided if reversal of these temporary 
differences can be controlled by the Group and it is probable that reversal will not occur in the foreseeable future.
Deferred tax liabilities are always provided for in full. Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits  
will be available against which the temporary differences can be utilised. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are calculated at tax rates that are  
expected to apply to their respective period of realisation, provided they are enacted or substantively enacted at the statement of financial position date.  
Tax expense recognised in profit or loss comprises the sum of deferred tax and current tax not recognised in other comprehensive income or directly  
in equity.
1.24 Defined contribution pension scheme
The pension costs charged in profit or loss represent the contributions payable by the Group during the year.
1.25 New accounting standards to update
No new standards, amendments or interpretations, effective for the first time for the financial year beginning on or after 1 January 2017 have had a 
material impact on the Group or parent Company.
The following standards have been issued by the IASB and have been adopted by the EU but not adopted early by the Group:
Standard Key requirements Effective date as adopted by the EU 
IFRS 9 Financial Instruments 1 January 2018
IFRS 15 Revenue from contracts with customers 1 January 2018
IFRS 16 Leases 1 January 2019
IFRS 9 – Financial instruments
This standard comes into effect for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018. Given the nature of the financial assets and liabilities 
of the Group and the parent Company, the key areas for consideration are trade receivables and intercompany receivables with the introduction of 
‘expected credit loss’ calculations. Given the work performed thus far, no material valuation impact is anticipated.
IFRS 15 – Revenue from customer contracts
This standard comes into effect for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018. The standard applies a single, five-step model based on 
the principle of transfer of promised goods and services (performance obligations) to the customer. Revenue is recognised upon satisfaction of these 
performance obligations. Having carried out a detailed assessment of the types of contracts the Group has with its customers, it is expected that the 
new standard will have a material impact on reported revenue due to the change in the timing of revenue recognition. The Group expects to use the 
retrospective approach when adopting the standard.
With respect to IFRS 15 implementation, the most significant ways that Dillistone generates income from its customers are as follows:
• Software as a Service (‘SaaS’) subscriptions – the customer pays a regular fixed amount for the right to access both software and related support 
service. Revenue is currently recognised over the life of the subscription, which is unchanged under IFRS 15;
• Outright licences – the customer pays a one-off amount to purchase a licence conferring a perpetual right to use a version of the software. 
Currently, revenue is recognised at the point control passes to the customer (i.e. ‘live’ date). Under IFRS 15, licences sold with elective support 
contracts are separate performance obligations and continue to be recognised at a point in time. However, licences sold with mandatory support 
contracts consist of one performance obligation, with revenue recognition matching the support contract;
• Product support – the customer pays a regular fixed amount for the right to access technical support services and the right to future software 
upgrades. Support subscriptions can be mandatory or elective depending on the software version purchased. Performance obligations under 
support contracts are satisfied over the subscription life, thus revenue is recognised over time under IFRS 15, as it is currently;

Notes to the Financial Statements continued

1. Accounting policies (continued)
• Installation services – the customer pays a fee for the software to be installed, with revenue currently recognised when the installation is complete. 
This will continue to be the case under IFRS 15 for most installations, which are not complex and could be completed by a third party. For complex 
installations, these combine with the licence to form one performance obligation, and revenue recognition consequently matches the licence;
• Training – the customer pays a fee to be trained in using the software. Training revenue is recognised under the existing standard when delivered. 
Under IFRS 15 this will continue to be the case for most training, as it is not essential to using the software. However, for training that is essential, 
training combines with the licence as one performance obligation with revenue recognition following the licence.
On the basis of the work performed thus far, the Group considers there to be no material adjustments to revenue arising from complex installations 
and essential training. The material impact on reported revenue arises from the combination of outright licence sales and mandatory support contracts 
into one performance obligation. This revenue will move from being recognised at a point in time to over time being the expected life of the support 
contract. We have taken the portfolio approach with respect to these contracts and have estimated an expected life of 5 years for them, which we 
intend to review on a periodic basis. Our work to date estimates an increase to 2017 revenue in the range of £0.1 - £0.3 million, and the change to 
retained earnings at 1 January 2017 to be a reduction in the range of £1.0 - £1.5 million. These calculations imply deferred income to be recognised in 
future periods in the range of £0.9 - £1.2 million. There will also be a corresponding tax deduction in respect of this adjustment in 2018.
IFRS 15 is not expected to have an impact on the parent Company.
IFRS 16 – Leases
This standard comes into effect for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2019. The standard requires almost all leases to be recorded 
in the statement of financial position. This requires recognition of a right-of-use asset and lease liability. The lease liability is measured as the present 
value of the future lease payments, discounted at the interest rate implicit in the lease if determinable, or otherwise at the lessee’s incremental 
borrowing rate. The asset is measured as equivalent to the lease liability, adjusted for other costs including initial direct costs or obligations under the 
lease such as restoration costs. The asset is subsequently depreciated on a straight line basis to the expected maturity date of the lease. The liability 
is increased by interest and reduced by the lease payments made. The impact of this standard is currently being assessed. See note 22 for detail on 
operating lease payment commitments.

The UK corporation tax rate fell in April 2017 to 19% from 20% and accordingly the rate for the year is 19.25%. Deferred tax is provided in relation 
to the UK at rates of between 17% to 19% depending on when reversals are expected to occur. The tax credit is impacted by the higher rates of 
corporation tax payable in the US, offset by the R&D tax credits available to Dillistone Systems division, Voyager Software division and GatedTalent 
division. It has also been assumed that where there are tax losses arising as a result of R&D tax credits they will be surrendered for a tax repayment 
at the HMRC stated rate of 14.5%. The release of prior year provisions relates, in part, to the agreement of the prior years’ tax positions of UK and US 
companies together with the formation of a tax group in Australia allowing surrender of losses between companies in the same jurisdiction and the 
utilisation of tax losses not previously recognised. The Group has gross tax losses and temporary timing differences of £205,000 (2016: £369,000) for 
which no deferred tax asset has been recognised as the timing of their utilisation is uncertain.

At the year end date, an impairment test has been undertaken by comparing the recoverable amount of the cash generating units listed below (CGU) 
to which the goodwill has been allocated, against the carrying value of those CGUs. The recoverable amount of the cash generating unit is based on 
value-in-use calculations. These calculations use cash flow projections covering a three year period based on financial budgets and a calculation of the 
terminal value, for the period following these formal projections.
The key assumptions used for value-in-use calculations are those regarding growth rates, increases in costs and discount rates. The discount rate is 
reviewed annually to take into account the current market assessment of the time value of money and the risks specific to the cash generating units 
and rates used by comparable companies. The pre-tax discount rate used to calculate value-in-use is in a range of 12% to 15.5% (2016: 12% to 
19.4%). Growth rates for forecasts take into account historic experience and current market trends. Costs are reviewed and increased for inflation 
and other cost pressures. The long term growth rate used for the terminal value calculation was 2.5% (2016: 1.75%) for all CGUs. The allocation of 
goodwill across the CGUs is as follows:

Sensitivities
A decrease in the cashflow by 10% would result in an impairment of £365,000 for the Voyager and FCP consolidated and an increase in the discount 
rate to 16.5% would require an impairment of £249,000. For ISV the discount rate would need to increase to over 23% or cash flows would need to 
fall by over 35% to reduce the headroom to £nil. Cashflows in respect of Dillistone goodwill would need to reduce by over 80% or the discount rate to 
increase to over 87% to reduce the headroom to £nil.

Intangible assets under development are reviewed each reporting period for impairment prior to amortisation. Forecasts of future revenue are prepared 
and these are discounted and compared to the carrying value. Sensitivities are carried out including applying differing growth and attrition rates as well 
as alternative discounts rates. The Group has reviewed its useful economic life in respect of non contractual relationships following the loss of a major 
contract in one part of the business. The revised useful economic life was reduced to 6 years (from 10 years) and resulted in additional amortisation in 
the period of £459,000.
Purchased software is reviewed for impairment based on its continued use within the business.
In 2016, the change in the estimate of the useful economic life of platform technology resulted in a one-off increase to the amortisation charge for the 
year of £720,000. 
The Company has no intangible assets.

The addition in the year related to the formation of GatedTalent. The 2016 addition related to the transfer of FCP Internet Limited from FCP Internet 
Holdings Limited to Dillistone Group Plc.
Investments are reviewed when evidence exists that their may be a loss in value or in certain circumstances where dividends are paid by the 
subsidiary. In 2017, following the loss of a major contract the Voyager/FCP investment has been reviewed as has the ISV investment following a 
dividend payment. The recoverable amount of the cash generating unit is based on value-in-use calculations Forecasts of future cash generation are 
prepared and these are discounted and compared to the carrying value of the investment. These calculations use cash flow projections covering a 
three year period based on financial budgets and a calculation of the terminal value, for the period following these formal projections.
The key assumptions used in these calculations are those regarding growth rates, increases in costs and discount rates. The pre-tax discount rate used 
was 15.5%. Growth rates for forecasts take into account historic experience and current market trends. Costs are reviewed and increased for inflation 
and other cost pressures. The long term growth rate used for the terminal value calculation was 2.5%.  
The calculations for Voyager/FCP showed that no impairment was required. If cashflows reduced by more than 7% or the discount rate increased to 
16.5% an impairment would be required. No impairment loss was required for ISV and cashflows would need to reduce by 37% or the discount rate to 
increase to more than 23% before impairment was considered necessary.

The Directors consider that the fair value of borrowings approximates to the carrying value except for the convertible loan note.
In 2017, the Company raised £400,000 from Directors and other PDMRs via a convertible loan note. The loan notes carry an interest coupon of 8.15% 
pa over their maximum term of 36 months, with a conversion price of 71.6p per new Dillistone ordinary share. The interest payments are payable 
quarterly in arrears and will be satisfied through the issue of further new ordinary shares or in cash at the individual loan note holder’s election. Various 
rights are built into the agreement for early repayment or conversion. Based on other outline loan offers around the time of the fund raising, a 10% rate 
has been used as the borrowing rate without conversion. This rate has been used in the calculation of the equity adjustment required in respect of this 
loan which totals £14,000.
The borrowings consisted of a bank loan repayable over 3 years from HSBC Bank plc secured by a fixed and floating charge over the assets of the 
Group and is supported by a cross guarantee between the Company and the Group’s principal subsidiaries. The loan was to provide part funding for 
the acquisition of ISV. The loan carries interest at 2.75% over UK base rate. This loan was repaid in 2017.
The loan included an option for early repayment at any time during the 3 year period. An early repayment fee of 1% of the amount prepaid must be 
made if the option is exercised. Management has reviewed the term of the prepayment option and deemed it to be closely related to the underlying 
debt instrument and hence it has not been separated from the host instrument.

23. Share options
Share based payments
There are three share option schemes in operation: an Enterprise Management Incentive Scheme (the ‘EMI Scheme’) which complies with the 
requirements of HMRC, a scheme which has not been approved by HMRC (the ‘Unapproved Scheme’) and a Share Save Scheme (“SAYE Scheme”). 
The terms and conditions of the EMI and Unapproved schemes are the same. If the options remain unexercised after a period of 10 years from the 
date of grant, the options expire. Options are normally forfeited if the employee leaves the Company before the options become available to exercise, 
which would normally be three years after grant. Performance conditions are associated with the LTIP options granted on 14 July 2015, 29 June 2016 
and 9 November 2017. The Company launched its first SAYE scheme in 2016 with a second issue in 2017. Under this scheme discounts of up to 
20% can be offered. The scheme has a linked savings contract of 3 years.
There were three grants of options in 2017. The weighted average share price of all grants in 2017 was 57.28p. The fair values of the services received 
in exchange for share based payments were calculated using a Black–Scholes pricing model. The inputs into the model were as follows:

The fair value of all options granted is shown as an employee expense with a corresponding increase in equity. The employee expense is recognised 
equally over the time from grant until vesting of the option. The expense charged takes into account the likelihood of performance targets being met. 
The employee expense for the year was £20,000 (2016: £16,000).

LTIP
LTIP awards under the long term incentive plan take the form of a cash bonus of up to one-third annual salary or the grant of share options, with 
appropriate performance conditions in place.
In 2017, the charge in respect of the LTIP schemes, which are share based and require separate disclosure under IFRS 2, was £10,000. www.dillistonegroup.com 55
24. Contingent consideration payable in respect of acquisitions
In September 2014 the Group acquired the entire share capital of ISV. As part of the acquisition, the vendors are entitled to contingent consideration 
based on revenue over the period to 30 September 2017. A payment of £219,000 was made in 2017. In the 2017 financial statements, the amount 
payable under the contingent consideration was decreased by £15,000 and this has been credited to the profit and loss. This contingent consideration 
has been discounted at 3.48% and the discount charged to profit and loss in 2017 totalled £5,000 (2016: £15,000). 
At the year end the Group had a liability for contingent consideration made up as follows:
• 30% of net revenues in the nine month period to 30 September 2017 less £25,000 (calculated at £146,000). 
25. Financial instruments
The Group uses various financial instruments; these include cash, bank deposits, bank loans and various items such as trade receivables and trade 
payables that arise directly from its operations. The main purpose of these financial instruments is to provide finance for the Group’s operations.
The Group’s finance department maintains liquidity, manages relations with the Group’s bankers, identifies and manages foreign exchange risk and 
controls Group treasury operations. Treasury dealings such as investments and foreign exchange are conducted only to support underlying business 
transactions. Consequently, the Group does not undertake speculative foreign exchange dealings for which there is no underlying exposure.
The Group’s policies for management of the financial risks to which it is exposed are outlined below.
(i) Interest rate risk
The Group is exposed to interest rate risk on its floating rate borrowings and its financial assets. The interest rate profile of the Group’s financial assets

The bench marks for interest rates on floating rate financial assets and financial liabilities are bank base rates for the currencies in which the assets 
are held. Sensitivities of movements in interest rates have been considered by Directors and reasonably possible movements in interest rates are not 
considered to have a material impact on future Group profits or equity.
(ii) Credit risk
The Group’s principal financial assets are cash and cash equivalents and trade and other receivables.
Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its contractual obligations and 
arises principally from the Group’s receivables from customers and monies on deposit with financial institutions.
Historically, the cash collection profile has been very good. Debt ageing and collections are monitored on a regular basis and for new customers 
deposits are usually required. Some of the unimpaired trade receivables are past due as at the reporting date. Information on financial assets past due 
but not impaired are included in note 17.
The credit risk on liquid funds is limited because the counterparties are banks with high credit ratings assigned by international credit rating agencies. 
The Group has no significant concentration of credit risk.
The Group’s maximum exposure to credit risk at the reporting date is represented by the carrying value of financial assets, as follows:

(iii) Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due. The Group’s approach to managing liquidity is to 
ensure it has sufficient liquidity to meet its liabilities when due.
As at 31 December 2017, the Group and Company’s financial liabilities (excluding deferred income, payroll taxes, VAT and similar taxes) have 
contractual cashflows as summarised below:

The Group would normally expect that sufficient cash is generated in the operating cycle to meet contractual cash flows as disclosed above. In addition 
the Group has significant cash balances as at the year end to minimise any liquidity risk.

(iv) Foreign currency risk
The Group is exposed to foreign currency risk on sales and purchases which are denominated in a currency other than Sterling. Exposures to currency 
exchange rates are primarily denominated in US Dollars ($), Australian Dollars (AUD) and Euros (€). The Group does not use derivatives to hedge 
translation exposures arising on the consolidation of its overseas operations.
The Group aims to manage foreign exchange risk at a local level by matching the currency in which revenue is generated and expenses are incurred. 
At the year end, the Group had assets totalling £1,837,000 and liabilities totalling £443,000 denominated in Euros (2016: assets totalling £1,307,000 
and liabilities totalling £547,000), assets totalling £1,655,000 and liabilities totalling £997,000 denominated in US Dollars (2016: assets totalling  
£1,729,000 and liabilities totalling £1,119,000) and assets totalling £441,000 and liabilities totalling £447,000 denominated in Australian Dollars 
(2016: assets totalling £445,000 and liabilities totalling £403,000). 
If each of the exchange rates strengthened by 5%, the impact on the statement of comprehensive income would be as follows:

Euros 31 20

At the year end, the Company had liabilities totalling £115,000 denominated in Euros (2016: liabilities totalling £115,000), assets totalling £257,000 
denominated in US Dollars (2016: assets totalling £281,000) and assets totalling £36,000 denominated in Australian Dollars (2016: assets totalling 
£27,000). 
For the Company a 5% increase in the value of each of the above currencies would have resulted in an impact on the income statement as follows:

Capital risk management
The Group’s objectives when managing capital are to safeguard the entity’s ability to continue as a going concern, so that it can continue to provide 
returns for Shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders.
The Group sets the amount of capital in proportion to risk. The Group manages the capital structure and makes adjustments to it in the light of 
changes in economic conditions and the risk characteristics of the underlying assets. In order to maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group 
may adjust the amount of dividends paid to Shareholders, return capital to Shareholders, issue new shares, sell assets or take on bank debt.  
The decision to take on some element of debt gives the Group additional flexibility in its capital structure and enables it to lower its cost of capital. 
The Group considers its capital to include share capital, share premium, merger reserve, translation reserve, convertible loan note reserve, share 
option reserve, retained earnings and net cash. Net cash comprises borrowings less cash and cash equivalents.

Contingent consideration 146 375 146 375
1,745 1,473 2,931 3,127
Financial assets and financial liabilities measured at fair value in the statement of financial position are grouped into three Levels of a fair value 
hierarchy. The three Levels are defined based on the observability of significant inputs to the measurement, as follows:
• Level 1: quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities
• Level 2: inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly
• Level 3: unobservable inputs for the asset or liability.
The following table shows the Levels within the hierarchy of financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis at 31 December 
2017 and 31 December 2016:
2017

Level 2
2016

Level 3
Contingent consideration: 146 375
The Group’s finance team performs valuations of financial items for financial reporting purposes, including Level 3 fair values, in consultation with 
third party valuation specialists for complex valuations. Valuation techniques are selected based on the characteristics of each instrument, with the 
overall objective of maximising the use of market-based information. The finance team reports directly to the Group Finance Director and to the audit 
committee. The valuation techniques used for instruments categorised in Level 2 and 3 are described below:
Contingent consideration (2017 – Level 2, 2016 – Level 3) 
The fair value of contingent consideration relates to the acquisition of ISV Software and is estimated using a present value technique. The contingent 
consideration at 31 December 2017 (level 2) of £146,000 is included at fair value which has been calculated as payable based on the revenues of ISV 
Software to 30 September 2017. The contingent consideration at 31 December 2016 (level 3) of £375,000 is included at fair value which is mainly 
based on actual, budget or forecast revenues prepared by the finance team. The contingent consideration in respect of 2016 is discounted.
The discount rate used to discount the contingent consideration at 31 December 2016 is 3.48% and is based on an after tax estimate of the Group’s 
current borrowing rate.  
The reconciliation of the carrying amounts of financial instruments classified within Level 3 is as follows:
2017

2016
