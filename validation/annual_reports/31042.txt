Achievements
 The first Kraken oil cargo 
was lifted from the FPSO in 
September.
 The final phases of  
Alma/Galia optimisation 
projects for power, 
produced water and sea 
water injection were 
completed, leading to 
increased production 
uptimes.
 The second Kraken 
production processing train 
was brought onstream in 
November, assisting in 
delivering gross production 
rates of over 40,000 Bopd.
 Kraken crude oil quality was 
well received by buyers, as 
reflected in the sale of some 
spot cargos at a discount to 
Brent of less than $5/bbl.
 In the Greater Kittiwake 
Area, the Mallard/Gadwall 
water injection flowline 
replacement was completed 
and brought into service.
 A compression reliability 
improvement programme 
was completed on  
PM8/Seligi, underpinning 
delivery of production 
volumes.
 At the start of December, 
EnQuest completed its 
acquisition of the Magnus 
oil field and Sullom Voe Oil 
Terminal, becoming the 
operator of both.
 Across 2017, the Group’s 
strong focus on HSE&A led 
to a significant improvement 
in the Recordable Incident 
Frequency Rate and 12 
months without a reportable 
hydrocarbon release in the 
North Sea business.
 In early 2018, EnQuest 
agreed renegotiated terms 
for the Transocean Leader 
drilling rig, reducing both 
the contract duration  
and day rates, saving 
c.$60 million of net cash 
payments for capital 
expenditure in 2019. Kraken 
full cycle gross project 
capital expenditure has 
been further reduced and is 
now expected to be c.$2.3 
billion, more than 25% lower 
than originally sanctioned.
 In January, EnQuest 
announced an agreement to 
acquire an initial 25% 
interest in the Magnus oil 
field and a 3.0% interest in 
the Sullom Voe Oil Terminal 
from BP via an innovative 
transaction structure.
 In February, the Kraken 
Floating Production, 
Storage and Offloading 
(‘FPSO’) vessel arrived in the 
field and was securely 
moored on station.
 The Alma/Galia FPSO was 
brought back onstream 
following unscheduled 
outages caused by winter 
storm damage.
 Excellent drilling progress 
was made at Kraken with the 
completion of the first and 
second drill centre (‘DC’) 
programmes, delivering 
seven producer and six 
injector wells, followed by 
drilling at DC3. 
 First oil was produced from 
the Kraken development in 
June.
 Kraken’s full cycle gross 
project capital expenditure 
estimate was reduced 
during 2017, reflecting the 
earlier than expected 
completion of DC3 and 
lower market rates for the 
remaining subsea campaign. 
The well completions 
included the world’s longest 
open hole interval gravel 
packed with OptiPac 
screens (4,347ft). 04

Thistle
Modern seismic; reactivation of the old drill rig and drilling 
of new wells; major power supply upgrade; introduction of 
new and simplified process controls and safety systems; 
integrity work on the platform topsides; water injection 
reliability programme; shutting off some water production 
from wells that produce high levels of water.
Thistle 
Returned to production levels it had not achieved since the 
1990s. In 2016, seven years after EnQuest started this 
programme, Thistle was still delivering very high levels of 
production efficiency. In 2017, well shut-ins delivered an 
extra 1,000 Bopd, double the target production uplift.
Heather/Broom
Drilling rig reactivation, drilling workovers and new wells; 
a new injection flowline; low-cost well abandonment to 
reduce integrity risk.
Heather/Broom 
Materially increased production levels and improved 
production efficiency.
Greater Kittiwake Area and Scolty/Crathes
Drilling, workovers and dissolver treatments; cost 
efficiency drive; delivery of first oil from the Scolty/Crathes 
development.
Greater Kittiwake Area and Scolty/Crathes
Gross production increased from 2,000 Boepd levels to 
between 14,000 and 16,000 Boepd by the last quarter of 
2015 and improved production efficiency; unit operating 
costs substantially down, from over $100/bbl to below  
$30/bbl; bringing Scolty/Crathes onstream extends the life 
of the GKA hub to at least 2025.
PM8/Seligi 
Facility integrity, gas compression overhaul and reliability; 
idle well restoration; process simplifications.
PM8/Seligi
Quickly increased gross production from 12,400 Boepd to 
15,100 Boepd; production efficiency has been enhanced 
and maintained at high levels. EnQuest PLC  Annual Report 2017

EnQuest PLC  Annual Report 2017
Chairman’s statement
EnQuest performance overview
EnQuest delivered a number of 
commendable operational achievements 
in 2017, combined with another year 
of strong safety performance. In June, 
first oil was achieved at the Kraken 
project, a critical turning point for 
the Company in delivering improved 
operating cash flow and marking the start 
of a material reduction in the Group’s 
capital investment requirements. While 
the subsequent ramp-up in production 
took longer than anticipated following 
initial commissioning and operational 
efficiency issues, by the end of the year, 
this large and complex development 
had produced over 40,000 Bopd (gross). 
In the first two months of 2018, average 
gross production was around 38,000 
Bopd, and has reached 50,000 Bopd 
with improving operational efficiency as 
we continue to optimise performance.
Group production of 37,405 Boepd in 2017 
was disappointing, primarily caused by 
performance issues at Alma/Galia and 
lower than planned production from both 
Kraken and Scolty/Crathes.
Despite the challenges presented by the 
prevailing macro-economic environment, 
the Group undertook further steps to 
set the platform to improve the balance 
sheet. The Group delivered operating 
and capital expenditures in line with 
targets, demonstrating the team’s focus 
on cost control and managing commercial 
agreements. EnQuest also completed 
a crude oil prepayment transaction and 
executed a refinancing agreement for 
its Tanjong Baram project in Malaysia, 
which combined improve the Group’s 
liquidity by more than $100 million.
The Group continued to pursue its vision 
and advance its long-term growth plan, 
agreeing and completing the acquisition 
of interests in the Magnus oil field and the 
Sullom Voe Oil Terminal (‘SVT’) from BP. 
This innovatively structured transaction 
required no immediate cash payment from 
EnQuest and limits the Group’s exposure 
to negative cash flows from Magnus, 
capitalising on EnQuest’s strengths in 
realising value from maturing oil fields with 
large volumes in place.
This transaction adds to the material 
growth potential of EnQuest’s asset 
base. By the end of 2017, EnQuest had 
a net 2P reserve base of 210 MMboe, 
which represents average growth of 
approximately 13% per annum since 
EnQuest’s formation eight years ago 
and a reserve life of around 17 years.
Industry context
Oil & Gas UK’s Economic Report 2017 
showed that since 2014 the cost of lifting 
oil from the North Sea has almost halved, 
an improvement in unit operating costs 
highlighted as being greater than the 
improvements achieved by any other 
basin. EnQuest’s cost conscious approach 
has been central to its business model 
since its inception and the Group remains 
focused on driving innovative and 
collaborative ways of operating to deliver 
cost savings across its business. While that 
quantum of reduction in operating costs 
cannot be repeated, a focus on improving 
costs and driving efficiencies is a 
fundamental requirement in ensuring 
EnQuest is able to deliver profitable 
growth over the long term.
The opportunity for long-term growth in 
the North Sea is clear: The UK Oil & Gas 
Authority recently announced they expect 
11.7 billion barrels of oil and gas to be 
produced from the UK Continental Shelf 
(‘UKCS’) over the period 2016 to 2050, an 
increase of 2.8 billion barrels of oil and gas 
from that previously forecast; and the UK 
Department for Business, Energy & 
Industrial Strategy forecasts oil and gas 
will still be supplying around two-thirds of 
domestic energy demand by 2035, 
confirming their place as vital sources of 
energy supply.
EnQuest is supportive of the UK 
Government’s proposals to introduce a 
mechanism to transfer tax history on the 
sale and purchase of North Sea oil assets. 
We welcome the removal of a potential tax 
barrier to the conclusion of deals. EnQuest 
has demonstrated the dramatic and 
positive impact on production, production 
efficiency and field life which can be 
achieved when assets move into the right 
hands. If implemented in the right way, 
these measures will be another positive 
step by the Government in supporting the 
strategy for Maximising Economic 
Recovery for the UK.
The UKCS remains a compelling basin 
in which to invest. It has exciting 
hydrocarbon opportunities, established 
infrastructure, access to a world-class 
supply chain and a highly skilled 
workforce, all supported by a globally 
competitive fiscal regime. A similar 
investment proposition continues to 
prevail in Malaysia where the Group has 
a strong partnership with PETRONAS. 
These opportunities provide EnQuest 
with long-term potential for growth.
The EnQuest Board
With the Board’s focus on succession 
planning, and after rigorous search 
processes, I was delighted to welcome 
three new Non-Executive Directors to the 
Company since the start of 2017: Carl 
Hughes joined the Board on 1 January 
2017, having previously been an energy 
and resources audit partner of Deloitte; 
John Winterman, who has extensive 
leadership experience in global 
exploration, business development and 
asset management, was appointed on 
7 September 2017; and Laurie Fitch, who 
has worked in a variety of investment and 
corporate finance roles, joined us on 
8 January 2018. All three bring 
considerable and varied expertise to the 
Company and I look forward to working 
with them.
In July 2017, Dr Philip Nolan stepped down 
from his role as Non-Executive Director, 
having joined the Board in 2012. I thank 
Philip for his valuable contribution to the 
Company, especially in its development 
over the past five years. I would also like to 
thank Neil McCulloch, who stepped down 
as Chief Operating Officer and Executive 
Director in December 2017, for his 
unstinting contribution to EnQuest during 
a challenging period for both the 
Company and industry.
EnQuest’s people
In 2017, the Group remained focused on 
positioning the business for the prevailing 
oil price environment, whilst at the same 
time ensuring it continued to achieve its 
operational targets. Management of 
matters pertaining to the Kraken and 
Magnus projects required significant 
amounts of the Board and management’s 
time and attention, while compliance with 
debt covenants and review of liquidity 
options also remained a priority. The 
Group’s achievements against these 
objectives have only been possible due to 
EnQuest’s people. The Board and I would 
like to express our gratitude to everyone 
at EnQuest for having continued to work 
with such energy and dedication to 
In 2018, EnQuest has entered a 
new phase.

The Group has a Code of Conduct that it 
requires all personnel to be familiar with as 
it sets out the behaviour which the 
organisation expects of its Directors, 
managers and employees, and of our 
suppliers, contractors, agents and 
partners. This year, it has been updated 
with guidance on preventing the 
facilitation of tax avoidance.
EnQuest’s Company values underpin 
a working environment where people 
are safe, creative and passionate, with 
a relentless focus on results. Inductions 
for all employees transferring from BP 
were run in September to ensure that 
all those impacted understood the 
EnQuest business, how we work and 
how they can contribute to EnQuest’s 
success. Alongside this, time was 
invested to understand the culture of 
our business through an online survey 
and subsequent focus groups. Following 
a review of the results from these 
activities, the Executive Committee is 
working on identifying the next steps 
to develop the culture and ensure that 
EnQuest is an attractive place to work.
Dividend
The Company has not declared or paid 
any dividends since incorporation and 
does not plan to pay dividends in the near 
future. Any future payment of dividends is 
expected to depend on the earnings and 
financial condition of the Company 
meeting the conditions for dividend 
payments which the Company has agreed 
with its lenders and such other factors as 
the Board of Directors of the Company 
considers appropriate.
2018: A new chapter
In 2018, EnQuest is entering a new phase. 
Kraken is progressing well, the Magnus 
integration and drilling programmes are 
well underway, plans are being developed 
to enhance performance at our other 
producing assets, and the period of heavy 
capital investment is largely behind us. 
These material advances should result in 
EnQuest generating positive net cash flow 
after investment and tax, allowing us to 
continue to manage our capital structure 
and liquidity position. Despite the current 
improvement in the near term oil price 
environment, we recognise we must 
maintain our focus on financial discipline, 
cost efficiencies and managing Group 
liquidity. Consequently, it is important that 
we prioritise our resources to those key 
projects which maximise cash flow to 
facilitate debt reduction, continuing the 
Company’s progress towards a more 
sustainable balance sheet and enabling 
the long-term growth of the business.
address the challenges presented in 
recent years, ensuring that EnQuest can 
move forward, to create further value from 
opportunities in maturing oil fields.
The Board and I would also like to take this 
opportunity to thank all those who worked 
on the acquisition of assets from BP, and 
extend a particularly warm welcome to our 
new colleagues and contractor workforce 
who joined EnQuest as a result.
Strategy and governance
The Directors provide strategic guidance 
to executive management and take key 
decisions on the implementation of the 
Group’s strategy. 
During 2017, the Board reviewed and 
refined the presentation of the Company’s 
purpose, vision, strategy and business 
model (see page 04). In addition, a  
number of ‘tenets’ were developed to 
guide the Company’s pursuit of its 
strategy in accordance with the Group’s 
appetite for risk and within its Risk 
Management Framework.
Ensuring that the Board works effectively 
remains a key focus of the Company.  
2017 saw the Risk Committee, established 
in 2016, fully embedded into the governance 
structure of the Company. The primary 
purpose of the Risk Committee is to 
provide a forum for in-depth examination 
of non-financial risk areas. EnQuest’s 
governance framework also contains 
several non-Board Committees, which 
provide advice and support to the 
Chief Executive, including an Executive 
Committee, Operations Committee and 
Investment Committee.
The Board believes that the manner in 
which it conducts its business is important 
and it is committed to delivering the 
highest standards of corporate 
governance for the benefit of all of its 
stakeholders. The Board has approved the 
Company’s overall approach to corporate 
responsibility, which is focused on five 
main areas. These are, Health and Safety, 
People, Environment, Business Conduct 
and Community.
The Board receives regular information on 
the performance of the Company in these 
areas, and specifically monitors health and 
safety and environmental reporting at 
each Board meeting. The Company’s 
Health, Safety, Environment & Assurance 
(‘HSE&A’) Policy is reviewed by the Board 
annually and all incidents, forward-looking 
indicators and significant HSE&A 
programmes are discussed by the Board. 
Specific developments and updates in all 
areas are brought to the Board’s attention 
when appropriate.

Chief Executive’s report
With production growing,  
a strong focus on cost control  
and a substantially reduced cash 
capital expenditure programme,  
EnQuest should see strong  
cash flow growth.
Amjad Bseisu Chief Executive
EnQuest’s priorities and performance 
in 2017
2017 was a transformational year for 
EnQuest, positioning the Group for 
profitable growth and transitioning from 
a period of heavy capital investment to 
one in which the Group can begin to 
reduce its debt. The Group focused on 
the Kraken development, completion of 
the asset acquisitions from BP, delivery 
against our financial and operational 
targets and the effective management 
of the Group’s financial position.
Operational performance
EnQuest was proud to deliver first 
oil from Kraken on schedule while 
significantly reducing full cycle gross 
capital expenditure. Kraken is one of the 
largest developments in the North Sea in 
the last ten years, comprising a phased 
drilling campaign of 25 wells tied back 
to a complex new Floating Production, 
Storage and Offloading (‘FPSO’) vessel. 
The drilling performance has been 
excellent, with the first three programmes 
completed early and at a lower cost than 
originally planned. The FPSO has taken 
longer than expected to commission, 
leading to lower operational efficiency 
than planned. A systematic process to 
resolve these issues has improved uptime 
and, with the reservoir performing in line 
with expectations, production increased 
throughout 2017 and into 2018.
On 1 December 2017, EnQuest completed 
the acquisition of initial interests in 
Magnus, SVT and associated infrastructure 
from BP and assumed operatorship. 
This large and complex transition 
was achieved safely and efficiently, 
delivered on time and on budget, with 
the integration of these assets into the 
EnQuest business progressing well.
EnQuest’s average production of 
37,405 Boepd reflected Electrical 
Submersible Pump (‘ESP’) performance 
issues at Alma/Galia and lower than 
planned production from both Kraken and  
Scolty/Crathes. Overall the Group’s 
production performance was disappointing 
and led to EnQuest reducing its 2017 
production guidance in August last year. 
However, the combination of improving 
performance at Kraken, planned drilling 
and workover campaigns at a number of 
assets and a full year’s contribution from 
Magnus underpins EnQuest’s expectation 
of material production growth in 2018.
Net 2P reserves of 210 MMboe at the end 
of 2017 represented a 2.4% decrease on 
the 215 MMboe at the end of 2016. This 
small decline reflects some changes in 
long-term assumptions, combined with 
lower production performance in the 
North Sea, partially offset by the Magnus 
acquisition related increase and better 
performance in Malaysia. When EnQuest 
was formed in 2010, it had 81 MMboe of 
reserves. Our ability to exploit, develop, 
convert and selectively acquire or dispose 
of reserves has meant that by the end 
of 2017, EnQuest had produced almost 
the entirety of this initial reserve base, 
and still has 2P reserves with a current 
production life of around 17 years.
Financial performance
The Group’s focus on financial discipline 
resulted in total operating expenditures 
of $349.3 million, unit opex of $25.6/Boe 
and cash capital expenditure of 
$367.6 million. While it is becoming more 
challenging to deliver the large decreases 
in operating costs of recent years, the 
Group will continue to pursue further 
operating cost reduction initiatives.
EBITDA of $303.6 million was materially 
lower than 2016. This reduction was 
driven by lower realised prices, which 
reflected the forward prices available at 
the time at which the commodity hedge 
programme was implemented, combined 
with lower production. The commodity 
hedge programme resulted in realised 
losses of $20.6 million in 2017 compared 
to realised gains of $255.8 million in 2016.
EnQuest’s ongoing programme of prudent 
measures to improve liquidity included 
the completion of an $80 million oil 
prepayment transaction and execution 
of a $37.25 million refinancing agreement 
in relation to its Tanjong Baram project, 
which completed in February 2018. 
Combined, this provides over $100 million 
of additional financial resources. EnQuest 
continued its close dialogue with its 
lending banks, agreeing a relaxation of 
the Company’s covenants and amending 
the amortisation schedule of its Term 
Loan and Revolving Credit Facility; these 
changes provided additional flexibility 
while Kraken continued to increase 
production rates. EnQuest finished the 
year with net debt of $1,900.9 million, 
excluding Payment in Kind interest.
Health, Safety, Environment and 
Assurance (‘HSE&A’)
EnQuest delivered on its commitment 
to continual improvement in HSE&A 
performance, achieving good year-on-year 
improvement in 2017 with excellent 
results in many areas and meeting the 
majority of our performance targets.
In occupational safety, our Lost Time 
Incident (‘LTI’) performance remained 
strong in both Malaysia and the UK, with 
many assets recording an LTI-free year. 
We had no reportable hydrocarbon 
releases during 2017 on our UK operated 
assets, having increased our focus on asset 
integrity and implemented hydrocarbon 
prevention plans across our sites. Our drive 
for operational excellence saw continued 
focus in the UK on coaching our workforce 
to identify and understand control of Major 
Accident Hazards (‘MAH’), embedding 
our life saving rules and transitioning 
to a new control of work tool which 
enhances both system and behavioural 
compliance. In March, members of the 
Board visited a contractor’s emergency 
response centre to help benchmark 
and refine EnQuest’s own emergency 
response and crisis management plans.
EnQuest’s focus on HSE&A is always 
a priority. Under our continual 
improvement programme, activities in 
2018 focus further on control of MAH 
and developing and empowering 
employees to deliver safe results.
North Sea operations
In December, Faysal Hamza and Bob 
Davenport took over management of 
EnQuest’s North Sea operations as 
Interim Head of North Sea and Managing 
Director – North Sea, respectively.
Production in 2017 from the North Sea 
averaged 28,467 Boepd, down 7.0% 
compared to 2016. This reduction was 
driven by lower volumes from Alma/Galia 
reflecting ESP-related well shut-ins, 
storm-related production outages 
and natural declines. Production at 
other assets was also reduced by lower 
water injection, natural declines and an 
unscheduled shutdown in December of 
the third-party operated Forties Pipeline.
Partially offsetting this decline was 
production from Kraken, a full year of 
production from Scolty/Crathes, limited 
by wax in the flowline, and the initial  11

2018 performance and outlook
The Group expects material production 
growth in 2018 to between 50,000 
and 58,000 Boepd, largely driven by 
performance at Kraken and a full year’s 
contribution from Magnus, partially 
offset by natural declines elsewhere in 
the portfolio. Production performance in 
the first two months of 2018 was strong 
across the portfolio, with Kraken gross 
production averaging around 38,000 Bopd 
in this period. Extreme cold weather in 
early March resulted in brief shutdowns at 
a number of the Group’s North Sea fields. 
While Kraken was shut down, the Group 
has undertaken much of the workscope 
previously scheduled for the planned 
shutdown in April and, as a result, this 
planned shutdown is no longer required. 
The Group continues to have planned 
maintenance shutdowns at a number of 
the Group’s fields, including Kraken, in 
the third quarter. During 2018, EnQuest 
expects to drill three wells at Magnus and 
two wells at PM8/Seligi which, along with 
the workover programme at Alma/Galia, 
should result in an improved production 
performance later in the year, with the DC4 
programme expected to come onstream 
in 2019, sustaining Kraken production.
Unit opex is expected to be approximately 
$24/Boe. Cash capital expenditure is 
expected to be lower than 2017 at 
approximately $250 million and primarily 
relates to drilling campaigns at Kraken, 
Heather and PM8/Seligi.
With production growing, a strong 
focus on cost control and a substantially 
reduced cash capital expenditure 
programme, the Group should generate 
positive net cash flow which will enable it 
to start reducing debt.
In January 2018, EnQuest received  
$30 million in cash in exchange for 
agreeing to undertake the management 
of the physical decommissioning at 
Thistle and Deveron and being liable to 
make payments to BP by reference to 
3.7% of the gross decommissioning costs 
of these assets.
Future growth opportunities
With Kraken delivering and the Group 
transitioning from a period of heavy 
investment, our focus is now turning 
towards the next stage of EnQuest’s 
development. The Group has significant 
potential within the existing portfolio, 
in particular at Magnus, PM8/Seligi 
and, in the longer term, Kraken. 
Each of these fields has substantial 
reserves and resources in place and 
with EnQuest’s proven capabilities in 
enhancing hydrocarbon recovery from 
mature and underdeveloped assets, 
the Group is well placed to deliver 
long-term sustainable growth.
contribution from Magnus. Various 
production enhancement activities 
were successfully undertaken during 
the year, improving performance at 
a number of fields by year end.
The Kraken development
Following first oil on 23 June 2017, 
production increased throughout the 
second half of the year as both production 
and injection wells performed in line with 
expectations and the commissioning and 
operational efficiency issues encountered 
during the initial production build up 
were addressed. The second processing 
train, which was brought online during 
November, assisted in bringing gross 
production rates to over 40,000 Bopd. 
All production and water injection wells 
from the first three drill centres have 
been brought online and operational 
efficiency has significantly improved. 
Whilst production has been constrained, 
FPSO charter rates have been reduced 
in accordance with production levels. 
We continue to work with the operator 
to maximise production from Kraken.
The combination of excellent delivery of 
the DC3 drilling programme, lower market 
rates for the remaining subsea campaign 
and the renegotiation of the drilling rig 
contract with Transocean has resulted in 
significant reductions to the full cycle gross 
project capital expenditure, which is now 
expected to be c.$2.3 billion. This is more 
than 25% lower than originally sanctioned.
Magnus and the Sullom Voe Oil Terminal
The acquisition is a good strategic and 
operational fit for EnQuest, providing 
opportunities for synergies and growth. 
We invest safely to realise value from 
opportunities presented in maturing 
assets, applying our differential 
capabilities to deliver high levels of 
production efficiency, asset life extension 
and cost control. The transaction 
is aligned with the UK’s strategy of 
Maximising Economic Recovery by 
getting the right assets into the right 
hands. Magnus is a good quality reservoir 
with large volumes in place, providing 
opportunities for infill drilling and the 
revitalisation of wells. BP’s confidence 
in EnQuest taking over operatorship 
underlines EnQuest’s capabilities 
as an asset life extension expert.
Malaysia operations
Production in 2017 was broadly in line 
with 2016 at 8,938 Boepd, reflecting good 
operational uptime across PM8/Seligi 
and Tanjong Baram and the execution of 
key work scopes, such as the compression 
reliability improvement and well 
interventions at PM8/Seligi. Given the 
natural decline rates of these mature 
fields, this performance is testament to 
the team’s capabilities in maximising 
hydrocarbon recovery in advance of 
the Group’s first drilling campaign 
in PM8/Seligi, planned for 2018.

Producing the goods
Kraken is transformational for EnQuest in 
the context of our production and cash 
generation performance. It is among the 
biggest operating assets when measured 
by production in the modern day UK North 
Sea. Following first oil on 23 June 2017, 
gross production rates of approximately 
40,000 Bopd were achieved towards the 
end of the year. With average gross 
production in the first two months of 2018 
around 38,000 Bopd and the targeted 
gross production of 50,000 Bopd achieved 
in early 2018. 
This centrepiece development in 
EnQuest’s portfolio will drive production 
and cash flow growth, which should enable 
the Group to begin reducing its debt.
Delivering on objectives
An interlinked series of factors contributed 
to successful delivery. These included:
A good understanding of a productive 
reservoir
• Exceptionally well mapped, with 3D 
seismic used to place wells
• Two discovery wells and nine appraisal 
wells were drilled
• In total, almost 50,000 feet measured 
depth of reservoir section has been 
drilled to date
• Deep directional resistivity data 
acquired in all development wells
Excellent drilling performance
• The rig deployed on Kraken was able to 
operate through challenging weather 
conditions, with recorded downtime 
levels of less than 5%
• A highly experienced and competent 
rig crew delivered continuous 
improvements by utilising lessons 
learned in each phase
• Drilling at the second and third drill 
centres (‘DC’s) were completed 
significantly ahead of schedule
• The team delivered the world’s longest 
open hole interval gravel packed with 
OptiPac screens at 4,347 feet on DC3
A project-specific model
• A comparatively small core team 
managed a limited number of larger 
contractors charged with delivering 
larger workscopes
• Fewer interfaces and greater scope for 
contractors to pursue efficient progress 
in their specialist areas underpinned 
our ability to deliver with agility and 
efficiency
• Tried-and-tested technologies and 
systems resulted in important cost 
efficiencies
As a result of the above initiatives and a 
strong focus on cost control and 
commercial agreements, the full cycle 
gross project capex is now expected to be 
approximately $2.3 billion, down more 
than 25% from the projected figure of  
$3.2 billion at project sanction. By the end 
of 2017, three of Kraken’s four drill centres, 
comprising 11 production wells and ten 
water injector wells, were operational. 
With high levels of safety performance 
throughout 2017 and reservoir 
performance in line with original 
expectations, the team is confident of 
maximising the long-term value of this 
landmark development.
As one of the most significant oil 
field projects in the UK Continental 
Shelf, successful production from 
Kraken is positive news for the 
whole basin. It has the potential 
to open up additional heavy oil 
opportunities in the Northern 
North Sea, with other 
developments in the pipeline. 
It’s particularly pleasing to see a 
project delivered under budget, 
having clearly benefited from a 
strong partnership between 
operator and key service  
providers.

EnQuest PLC  Annual Report 2017
With their integrated skills, operational scale, cost 
structures and high levels of operating efficiency, we have 
seen what EnQuest can do on the Thistle, Deveron and 
Dons fields that were previously operated by BP . We 
believe this is a good example of having the right assets in 
the right hands, offering new opportunities for the assets 
and benefiting the UKCS, in the spirit of Maximising 
Economic Recovery (MER UK).
Mark Thomas 
BP North Sea Regional President
Realising potential
Our experience and track record of 
extending field lives and our ability to 
extract additional value from mature 
assets, alongside our excellent Health, 
Safety and Environmental performance, 
positioned EnQuest as the ideal party to 
assume operatorship of the UK North 
Sea’s most northerly installation.
Early in 2017, EnQuest agreed to acquire 
an initial 25% interest in Magnus, as well  
as additional stakes in the Sullom Voe Oil 
Terminal (‘SVT’), the Northern Leg Gas 
Pipeline and the Ninian Pipeline System 
from BP.
At the time of the agreement announcement, 
BP expressed its confidence in EnQuest’s 
ability to extend the productive life of 
Magnus and consequently support the 
Maximising Economic Recovery (‘MER’) 
agenda for the UK North Sea.
The innovative nature of the contract 
structure may serve as a model for the 
future transfer of mature assets from 
majors to operators-of-scale focused on 
maximising value and, therefore, as a 
template for the pursuit of the UK’s MER 
goals. The terms of the initial deal mean 
there are no requirements for cash from 
EnQuest, other than as generated from 
transaction assets, and no exposure to 
cumulative negative cash flows.
Upon completion on 1 December 2017, 
EnQuest assumed operatorship, enabling 
the team to explore the potential of the 
field that brings with it approximately 
14 MMboe of additional net 2P reserves 
(at 31 December 2017). Full year net 
production in 2017 was 3,928 Boepd.
Safety, efficiency, value
The 2018 plan for Magnus can be 
summarised as: keep it safe, increase 
efficiency and explore how we can create 
further value.
Immediate activities include performing 
two well interventions and drilling a new 
long-reach producer well to enhance 
production rates. Proposals are also being 
developed to drill ‘twin’ producer and 
injector wells later this year. At the same 
time, the team will review platform 
operations – primarily to eliminate 
unnecessary complexity – while maintaining 
our focus on safety.
Magnus’ proximity to our other Northern 
North Sea assets also presents the 
opportunity for EnQuest to identify 
and capitalise on efficiencies in areas 
such as logistics support, while our 
pre-negotiated option to acquire BP’s 
remaining 75% interest in Magnus, 
as well as additional interests in the 
other transaction assets, potentially 
positions us to generate further value.
New depth of experience
With more than 300 employees working at 
Magnus, SVT and onshore in Aberdeen 
transferring to EnQuest, our business-wide 
pool of experience, knowledge and 
competency has also grown. Amid this 
growth, we commit to preserving the 
essential EnQuest characteristics of agility 
and dynamism.
At SVT, we intend to engage with other 
stakeholders to ensure it remains 
fit-for-purpose and proactively explore 
new business opportunities and maximise 
the long-term value of the terminal. As an 
operator of assets, we have a proven track 
record of driving efficiency improvements 
while lowering costs.
Around one-third of EnQuest’s North Sea 
production flows through the terminal, so 
it plays an important role in EnQuest’s 
future growth and is an essential element 
of the Group’s North Sea portfolio.
Magnus: key facts
• Discovered in March 1974 in the 
4th licensing round
• Oil was found 2,709 metres below the 
seabed in a water depth of 186 metres
• The UK’s most northerly field, located 
160 kilometres NE of the Shetland 
Islands, mainly in Block 211/12a
• Oil is recovered by 14 deviated 
platform wells, then metered and 
exported to SVT
• Gas separated from the oil is cooled  
and compressed to recover valuable gas 
liquids. Dry gas is used to power the 
platform and provide gas lift to oil wells; 
quantities beyond this are exported via 
the FLAGS pipeline to St Fergus
SVT: key facts
• Located at the northern end of the 
largest of the Shetland Islands, it is one 
of the largest oil terminals in Europe
• Built between 1975 and 1981 and covers 
1,000 acres
• Provides critical storage capacity for 
the offshore producing fields before oil 
is loaded on to tankers for onward 
shipping to refineries worldwide
• Handles production through the Brent 
and Ninian pipeline systems from more 
than two dozen oil fields in the east 
Shetland Basin, between Shetland and 
Norway. Gas is also imported from 
West of Shetland fields via a 20-inch 
pipeline, some is used as fuel in the 
Power Station and some is exported to 
Magnus where it is used for Enhanced 
Oil Recovery

Untapped potential
EnQuest’s expertise in deriving maximum value from 
established assets is exemplified in our work in the  
PM8/Seligi

 fields in Malaysia, where we have arrested 
a decline in production and plan to realise much more 
untapped potential.
PM8/Seligi is a group of proven oil 
fields with significant untapped 
reservoir potential. It is very much 
part of EnQuest’s future… part of 
our growth opportunity story.
John Penrose, Managing Director, Malaysia
A mature oil field
Historically, the PM8 and Seligi fields were 
in the group of the largest oil producing 
developments in Malaysia. Having been in 
production for more than two decades, 
the fields had been in natural decline. 
EnQuest’s focus on owning and operating 
maturing and underdeveloped 
hydrocarbon assets has delivered 
exceptional results since its acquisition of 
an operated interest in the combined PM8 
Production Sharing Contract and Seligi oil 
field in 2014. These outstanding results 
have been achieved before we conduct 
our first drilling campaign in the fields.
PM8/SELIGI
1 PM8/Seligi is the term EnQuest 
uses to refer to the PM-8 
Extension Production Sharing 
Contract (‘PSC’) as it is officially 
known by the Malaysian authorities. 
The PSC comprises the PM8 PSC 
assets and the Seligi oil field and 
the term of the PSC runs to 2033. STRATEGIC

Value enhancement through EnQuest’s 
differential capabilities
Without EnQuest’s focused life extension 
capability, it is anticipated production 
rates would have continued to decline.  
By instigating work programmes on both 
the topside facilities and wells, and 
pursuing performance efficiency across 
our operations, we arrested the long-term 
decline trend and started developing a 
strategy for future growth. Achievements 
to date include:
• Well intervention activities responsible 
for increasing our overall active well 
stock and reducing the gas:oil ratio 
allowing for more robust operations;
• Rotating machinery reliability 
improvements, primarily relating to the 
gas compression trains;
• Production history matching within the 
reservoir surveillance and dynamic 
simulation models to support future 
investment in development drilling and 
secondary recovery schemes to add 
additional reserves and further extend 
field life;
• Process simplification: using Multi-Phase 
Flow Meters in place of Test Separators 
to reduce equipment count; and 
eliminating the requirement to maintain 
redundant equipment; and
• Improving safety systems, asset integrity 
and equipment reliability by upgrading 
and replacing obsolete components.
These programmes have helped PM8/Seligi 
deliver average working interest production 
of 8,123 Boepd in 2017. This ranks the fields 
as EnQuest’s single largest production hub 
in 2017, generating 22% of EnQuest’s total 
production and 22% more than the next 
largest hub.
Such success would not have been 
possible, however, without a strong 
relationship with our regulator and partner, 
the national oil company Petroliam 
Nasional Berhad (‘PETRONAS’), which 
holds a 50% interest in the fields through its 
subsidiary PETRONAS Carigali Sdn Bhd. 
PETRONAS has recognised these 
achievements, reflecting our focus on 
efficiency and the application of the right 
resources at the right time. They have 
shared an outline of our idle well 
restoration template with other operators 
as an example of good practice in 
leveraging maximum value from mature 
assets. We have also received recognition 
from PETRONAS for our subsurface work in 
maximising value creation, well intervention 
campaigns, effective shutdown execution, 
focus on flare optimisation and assistance 
in meeting domestic demand fluctuations 
for natural gas. 
2018 and beyond
The first drilling campaign will be 
performed in 2018 and will feature one 
appraisal well and one development well 
within the PM8/Seligi field. This campaign 
represents the first drilling activity at  
PM8/Seligi since 2011. Beyond the 
additional production gains, coring and 
electric logging in the appraisal well will 
yield new reservoir data to inform further 
drilling campaigns, and therefore help to 
shape future growth activities. The work is 
to be performed by a semi-submersible 
tender assisted drilling rig and is scheduled 
for completion in the second half of 2018.
PM8/Seligi: key facts
• The group of oil fields is c.300 kilometres 
off Peninsular Malaysia in 70 metres 
water depth
• Oil in the Seligi field is found in 
reservoirs located between 1,000 metres 
to 2,000 metres vertically beneath the 
seabed
• Two central processing platforms and 
one flare structure
• 11 satellite platforms
• 370 kilometres of pipeline
• Average age of assets: 21 years

Operating review
We were delighted to take charge of North Sea operations 
at such an exciting time. In particular, with Kraken onstream 
and the acquisition of the Magnus oil field and SVT 
completed, EnQuest is embarking on a new phase in its 
development.
Faysal Hamza, Interim Head of North Sea and Managing Director 
– Corporate Development
North Sea operations overview
EnQuest delivered some notable 
achievements during the year, particularly 
the delivery of first oil from Kraken on 
schedule and completing the acquisition 
of initial interests in the Magnus oil field, 
the Sullom Voe Oil Terminal (‘SVT’) and 
associated infrastructure assets from BP. 
Kraken is a landmark heavy oil 
development project, one of the largest 
developments in the North Sea in the 
last ten years. The drilling performance 
has been excellent, with programmes 
completed early and at a lower cost than 
originally planned. Although there were 
some initial issues with a prolonged 
commissioning of the Floating Production, 
Storage and Offloading vessel leading to 
lower operational efficiency, substantial 
progress has since been made and 
performance continues to improve. 
On 1 December 2017, EnQuest completed 
the acquisition of assets from BP . Following 
a period of extensive preparation, the 
assets and operations were transitioned 
safely and smoothly to EnQuest and 
the integration programme is now well 
underway. Both assets offer excellent 
opportunities for EnQuest and the wider 
industry and are in the spirit of Maximising

Bob Davenport, Managing Director – North Sea
Economic Recovery in the UK Continental 
Shelf. Magnus is a good operational fit and 
is close to EnQuest’s existing operated 
assets in the Northern North Sea. It has 
high quality reservoirs with significant 
future opportunities. EnQuest is drilling 
three wells in 2018 to deliver increased 
volumes. At SVT, approximately one-third 
of the Group’s North Sea production 
flows through the terminal. As such, it 
has the potential to play an important 
role in EnQuest’s future growth.
The Group’s North Sea production 
declined to 28,467 Boepd, down 7.0% on 
2016. Underperformance at Alma/Galia  
and natural declines elsewhere were 
partially offset by a full year’s contribution 
from Scolty/Crathes and initial 
contributions from Kraken and Magnus. 
A focus on cost control and commercial 
agreements resulted in operating 
costs being in line with the Company’s 
expectations. Such financial discipline 
is an essential part of the way in which 
EnQuest does business. Unit operating 
costs have reduced significantly from 
historical levels, particularly when the price 
of oil was above $100/bbl, but the Group 
recognises the need to continue to work 
on delivering further cost efficiencies. 
At the end of 2017, Faysal Hamza and Bob Davenport took over management of 
EnQuest’s North Sea operations as Interim Head of North Sea and Managing 
Director – North Sea, respectively. 20

 – 2016: 18,885 Boepd
1 Includes net production from Magnus since the 
acquisition on 1 December 2017, averaged over 
the 12 months to the end of December 2017.
2017 performance summary
Production in 2017 of 15,627 Boepd was 
17.3% lower than 2016. This reduction was 
primarily driven by lower water injection at 
Heather/Broom and Thistle/Deveron, 
combined with natural declines at these 
and the Dons fields. Production efficiency 
at Heather/Broom and the Dons fields was 
very good, and the contribution from 
Magnus also helped mitigate the reduced 
production.
During the year, work programmes to 
improve the reliability of water injection on 
Heather/Broom, Thistle/Deveron and the 
Dons were successful, delivering improved 
performance by the year end. Water 
injection was reinstated at the Dons in 
December 2017 following the replacement 
of the water injection pipelines. On 
Thistle, work was undertaken to improve 
the reliability of water injection and shut 
off areas of the reservoir in which high 
volumes of water were being produced. 
The resulting improved water injection 
performance significantly increased 
reservoir pressure. Shutting off some 
water production from four wells that 
produced high levels of water increased oil 
production by around a thousand barrels 
per day, doubling the target uplift from 
this work scope. When combined with 
NORTHERN NORTH SEA OPERATIONS
better plant uptime, these programmes 
enabled Thistle production rates to finish 
the year strongly.
Reservoir performance and production 
were above expectations at Don 
Southwest, with production improving 
chemical treatments completed at West 
Don and Don Southwest.
Average gross production of c.16,000 
Boepd from Magnus during the full year 
2017 was similar to 2016; a good result 
during this intensive period of preparation 
for transition. Upon completion of the 
acquisition on 1 December 2017, EnQuest 
became duty holder and operator. 
As part of EnQuest’s asset life extension 
strategy, a series of idle well reservoir 
abandonments were successfully 
undertaken at Thistle and Heather to 
reduce integrity risks and provide 
opportunities for future drilling of infill 
wells. The abandonment programme on 
Heather partially abandoned legacy wells 
which should safeguard sustained high 
water injection reservoir efficiency.  
The programme was well executed, 
delivered ahead of schedule and under 
budget. This allowed the team to include 
an additional well within the programme 
cost estimate. These programmes, 
co-funded by EnQuest’s partners, 
demonstrate EnQuest’s ability to execute 
low-cost well work and is an important 
new component of the strategy to extend 
the lives of these fields, benefiting all 
stakeholders in these fields. 
EnQuest people
Since the first day of joining 
EnQuest I have particularly enjoyed 
working with my new colleagues

Following an upgrade of the drilling rig, 
the 2018 drilling programme includes a 
well intervention plan (logging and 
potentially also perforations) then two 
production wells and one injection well  
set to come onstream during 2018. In early 
Q1, the first wireline intervention was 
successfully completed, prior to the 
spudding of the first new sidetrack well. 
New production efficiency enhancement 
opportunities are also being assessed.
A strategic infrastructure hub
SVT was commissioned in 1978 and 
receives East of Shetland (‘EoS’) oil via 
the Brent Pipeline System, which services 
Brent, Thistle, Northern Producer, Alwyn 
and TENCCA, and the Ninian Pipeline 
System, which services Ninian, Magnus 
and Heather. Since 1998, the terminal has 
also provided services to West of Shetland 
(‘WoS’) fields, including Schiehallion, 
Clair and Foinaven. Gas from these three 
fields is ‘sweetened’ at SVT before being 
shipped to Magnus, for Enhanced Oil 
Recovery and onward export. The terminal 
also now processes condensate from 
the Laggan-Tormore development.
Following the safe and efficient transfer of 
operatorship to EnQuest on 1 December 
2017, steady operations have continued.
Building on the work that BP as operator 
and EnQuest and other owners have 
undertaken in recent years, EnQuest 
is targeting cost improvements and 
exploring terminal life extension 
opportunities which could benefit wider 
Northern North Sea and WoS operations.
EnQuest people
EnQuest has lots of great people and 
for me that’s what makes it a brilliant 
environment to work in. Every 
department within the Company 
works closely together, resulting 
in robust decisions being made 
quickly. For the wells team, 2017 was 
a fantastic year and that’s down to 
the people and the way in which the 
Company encourages us to work.

2017 performance summary
Production in 2017 of 8,131 Boepd was 
30.6% lower than 2016. This reduction 
was primarily driven by lower volumes 
at Alma/Galia reflecting Electric 
Submersible Pump (‘ESP’) related well 
shut-ins, storm-related production 
outages and natural declines. Field 
performance improved in the second 
half of the year following completion 
of the optimisation projects for power, 
produced water and sea water injection. 
Good production has been delivered 
from the Greater Kittiwake Area (‘GKA’), 
with high levels of plant uptime and 
production efficiency. The GKA work 
programme was focused on optimising 
production across the assets, including 
replacement of the Mallard/Gadwall 
water injection flowline and the E gas 
compressor crank shaft. The GKA team 
delivered a good HSE&A performance 
and was proud to have delivered  
12 years of operations without an LTI.
In line with previous updates, the full 
year contribution from Scolty/Crathes 
was limited due to wax in the flowline. 
These wax issues continue to be managed 
with chemical and lift gas treatments. 
Full year production uptime has been 
very high with the reservoir performing 
well. The unscheduled shutdown in 
December of the third-party operated 
Forties Pipeline resulted in the GKA 
and Scolty/Crathes fields being shut 
down for approximately three weeks, 
during which time opportunistic 
maintenance work was undertaken.

2017 performance summary
The FPSO arrived in the North Sea in early 
January and was on-station and securely 
moored by mid-February, with first oil 
delivered on 23 June 2017. The four wells 
from the first Drill Centre (‘DC’) and the 
three wells from DC2 produced at initial 
gross rates above expectations and with 
stabilised flow rates which confirmed the 
field development plan. Water injection 
wells performed in line with expectations. 
During the period after first oil, prolonged 
commissioning of the complex Kraken 
FPSO vessel led to lower than expected 
production efficiency and to initial 
production volumes being lower than 
expected. EnQuest continued with 
its plan of bringing wells onstream in 
a phased manner, in line with good 
reservoir management practices aimed 
at maximising long-term productivity and 
value. The second processing train, which 
was brought online during November, 
assisted in bringing gross production rates 
to over 40,000 Bopd. Since late December, 
all DC3 wells have been brought online 
and operational uptime has improved. 
Following the excellent delivery of 
the DC3 drilling programme and 
lower market rates for the remaining 
subsea campaign, full cycle gross 
Kraken project capital expenditure 
was further reduced during 2017. 
Cargo offloads started in September and 
one was successfully completed in each 
subsequent month. The quality of the 
crude has been well received by buyers.  
By as early as November, a sale of cargo 
had been contracted at a discount to Brent 
of less than $5/bbl, this level of pricing 
being achieved earlier than targeted.

as a result, this planned shutdown is no 
longer required. EnQuest continues to 
have a summer shutdown planned for one 
week in September.
In early 2018, EnQuest agreed renegotiated 
terms with Transocean for the Transocean 
Leader drilling rig, reducing both the 
contract duration and the day rates, 
saving c.$60 million of net cash payments 
for capital expenditure in 2019. Full cycle 
gross project capital expenditure has been 
reduced by approximately $100 million and 
is now expected to be c.$2.3 billion, more 
than 25% lower than originally sanctioned.
THE KRAKEN DEVELOPMENT
Kraken is one of the largest 
developments in the UK North 
Sea in the last decade.

Being part of an evolving 
organisation with a leading edge is 
what excited me initially, and it still 
does. Every day, my work presents 
me with numerous ways to enhance 
my skills outside of joint venture 
accounting, allowing me to gain a 
better understanding of the wider 
operations and business.

2017 performance summary
At PM8/Seligi, EnQuest continued 
to enhance production by investing 
in low cost well interventions and 
facility projects to improve production 
efficiency, including gas compression 
package major overhauls, well test 
improvements with Multi-Phase Flow 
Meters and process simplifications to 
improve overall reliability. In addition, 
robust maintenance and integrity 
inspection campaigns of platform 
structures, topsides and subsea pipelines 
continued to ensure safe operations. 
During 2017, the first new drilling projects 
were defined for execution in 2018, 
and significant progress was made 
on rebuilding of static and dynamic 
reservoir simulation models in support 
of longer term field redevelopment. 
At Tanjong Baram, the focus remained 
on steady, safe and low-cost operations 
with high levels of production efficiency 
and uptime throughout the year. 
At PM8/Seligi, successful execution  
of planned well work and maintenance 
programmes underpinned strong 
production delivery from the field.

3 The Group’s underlying technical data underpinning proven and probable reserve profiles has been 
audited by a recognised Competent Person in accordance with the definitions set out under the 2007 
Petroleum Resources Management System and supporting guidelines issued by the Society of 
Petroleum Engineers.

7 Proven and probable reserves: Acquisition of 25% equity in Magnus.  
Contingent resources: Acquisition of 25% equity in Magnus offset by relinquishment of the Group’s 
equity interests in the Crawford, Porter and Elke licences and expiry of 50% of the Kildrummy licence.
8 The above proven and probable reserves include 5.8 MMboe that will be consumed as lease fuel on the 
Kraken FPSO and fuel gas on Heather, Broom, West Don, Don SW, Conrie and Ythan.
9 The above table excludes Tanjong Baram in Malaysia.
The Group’s net 2P reserves at the end of 
2017 were 210 MMboe, down 2.4% from 
215 MMboe at the end of 2016. This slight 
reduction was driven by:
• Production of 12 MMboe from existing 
assets and the Kraken development, 
which came onstream in Q2;
• Changes in long term assumptions;
• Lower production performance in the 
North Sea; partially offset by
• The acquisition of 25% equity in the 
Magnus oil field, which added  
14 MMboe after accounting for 2017 
production; and
• Better than expected reservoir and well 
intervention performance, idle well 
restoration work and clearly defined 
near term work programme in Malaysia.
Contingent resources at the end of 2017 
were 164 MMboe, up 8.6% from 151 
MMboe at the end of 2016. This increase 
was driven by:
• Changes to longer term field 
redevelopment plans at PM8/Seligi;
• The acquisition of 25% equity in the 
Magnus oil field; and
• Revisions associated with future 
development plans at other North Sea 
assets, including Kraken offset by the 
disposal of the Group’s interests in the 
Crawford, Porter and Elke discoveries 
and the licence expiry for 50% of the 
Kildrummy discovery.

Financial Review
With Kraken onstream and the acquisition 
of assets from BP completed, the Company 
is well placed to deliver value in the medium 
to long term.
Jonathan Swinney,  
Chief Financial Officer
Financial overview
All figures quoted are in US Dollars and relate to business performance unless 
otherwise stated. 
EnQuest has continued to focus on project execution and financial 
discipline. The Company delivered first oil from the Kraken 
development in June 2017 and completed the acquisition of initial 
interests in the Magnus oil field and Sullom Voe Oil Terminal (‘SVT’) 
through an innovatively structured transaction in December. 
EnQuest also continues to focus on cost control and cash 
management, and as operating cash flows grow and capital 
expenditure reduces, this should facilitate reductions in debt. 
These key milestones, along with the effective management of the 
Group’s liquidity position, continue to ensure that the Company is 
well placed to deliver value to stakeholders in the medium and 
long-term. 
Production on a working interest basis decreased by 5.9% to 
37,405 Boepd, compared to 39,751 Boepd in 2016. Lower 
production at Alma/Galia and natural declines at the Group’s 
other North Sea fields were partially offset by production from 
Kraken and a full year of production from Scolty/Crathes, which 
came onstream in November 2016. 
Total revenue for 2017 was $635.2 million, 25.2% lower than 2016 
($849.6 million). This was as a result of lower realised oil prices, 
reflecting the forward prices available at the time at which the 
commodity hedge programme was implemented, combined with 
lower production. The commodity hedge programme resulted in 
realised losses of $20.6 million in 2017 compared to realised gains 
of $255.8 million in 2016.
The Group’s operating expenditures of $349.3 million were 2.3% 
lower than 2016 ($357.4 million), but unit operating costs increased 
by 4.0% to $25.6/Boe as a result of lower production.

Where the derivative hedges capital expenditure, the (gain)/loss is added 
back when calculating EBITDA in order to reflect the underlying result of 
operating activities.
EBITDA for 2017 was $303.6 million, down 36.4% compared to 
2016 ($477.1 million), primarily as a result of lower revenue.
Business performance loss after tax for 2017 was $33.6 million 
(2016: profit of $121.5 million). After re-measurements and 
exceptional items, the Group recorded a net loss of $60.8 million 
(2016: net profit of $185.2 million).
Reflecting the ongoing investments EnQuest has made to 
develop its assets, notably Kraken, EnQuest’s net debt increased 
from $1,796.5 million at the end of 2016 to $1,991.4 million at 
31 December 2017. This includes $90.5 million of interest that has 
been capitalised to the principal of the facilities pursuant to the 
terms of the Group’s November 2016 refinancing (‘PIK’).

As at 31 December 2017, total cash and available facilities totalled 
$244.4 million, excluding $26.5 million of cash from the ring fenced 
working capital facility associated with SVT (2016: $330.9 million 
excluding $nil cash from the ring fenced SVT working capital 
facility).
UK corporate tax losses at the end of the year increased to $3,121.3 
million. In the current environment, no material corporation tax or 
supplementary corporation tax is expected to be paid on UK 
operational activities for the foreseeable future. The Group paid 
cash corporate income tax on the Malaysian assets which will 
continue throughout the life of the Production Sharing Contract. 32
EnQuest PLC  Annual Report 2017
Income statement
Production and revenue
Net working interest production of 37,405 Boepd was 5.9% lower 
than 2016 (39,751 Boepd). This reduction primarily reflects the 
impact of ESP performance issues at Alma/Galia, natural declines 
in the Group’s assets where there has been no recent drilling, 
partially offset by the impact of commencement of production at 
Kraken in June 2017 and a full year of production from Scolty/
Crathes, which achieved first oil in November 2016.
On average, market prices for crude oil in 2017 were higher than in 
2016. The Group’s blended average realised oil price excluding the 
impacts of hedging was $53.9/bbl for 2017, 21.8% higher than 2016 
($44.3/bbl). Revenue is predominantly derived from crude oil sales 
and for 2017, crude oil sales totalled $637.0 million, 10.2% higher 
than 2016 ($577.8 million). The increase in revenue reflected higher 
market prices for crude oil, partially offset by lower production. 
Revenue from the sale of condensate and gas was $2.8 million 
(2016: $3.6 million) while tariffs and other income generated 
$16.0 million (2016: $12.4 million). The Group’s commodity hedges 
and other oil derivatives generated $20.6 million of realised losses 
(2016 income: $255.8 million), including $10.4 million of non-cash 
amortisation of option premiums (2016: $31.2 million).

Cost of sales were $569.5 million for the year ended 31 December 
2017, 12.9% lower than 2016 ($653.5 million). Operating costs 
decreased by $8.1 million, reflecting the benefit of a weaker Sterling 
exchange rate and net lease charter payment credits of $19.5 
million arising from the non-availability of the Kraken FPSO, partially 
offset by a full year of operations at Scolty/Crathes. The Group’s 
average unit operating cost has increased by 4.0% to $25.6/Boe, 
primarily due to the 5.9% reduction in production volumes. 
At 31 December 2017, the Group had moved to a net underlift 
position compared to the prior year end net overlift position, 
resulting in a $20.4 million credit to cost of sales (2016: charge of 
$2.8 million). The Group’s change in lifting position and inventory 
reflected the unwind of the overlift balance that had accrued at 
31 December 2016, primarily on Thistle and GKA, partially offset 
by the unwind of underlift at Alma/Galia and the build up of an 
overlift at Scolty/Crathes.
Depletion expense of $223.1 million was 7.3% lower than 2016 
($240.6 million), reflecting lower production in 2017. The average 
unit depletion rate decreased slightly from $16.6/Boe to $16.3/Boe.
Other cost of sales of $12.7 million were higher than 2016  
($5.4 million), principally driven by the impact of higher oil prices 
on the supplemental payment due on profit oil in Malaysia. 
General and administrative expenses
General and administrative expenses were $0.8 million  
(2016: $10.9 million), reflecting the Group’s ongoing efforts to 
reduce costs across the organisation.
Other income and expenses
Net other expenses of $17.6 million (2016: income of $51.9 million) 
primarily comprises net foreign exchange losses, which relate to 
the revaluation of Sterling denominated amounts in the balance 
sheet following the strengthening of Sterling against the US 
Dollar, offset by one-off general and administration recovery 
impacts. The prior year income comprised almost entirely of net 
foreign exchange gains.
Finance costs
Finance costs of $149.0 million were 21.9% higher than 2016  
($122.2 million). The charges include $137.9 million of bond and 
loan interest payable (2016: $110.5 million), $13.5 million unwinding 
of discount on provisions and liabilities, largely in respect of 
decommissioning (2016: $14.2 million), $2.8 million amortisation  
of arrangement fees for the bank facilities and bonds  
(2016: $5.9 million) and other financial expenses of $5.9 million 
(2016: $10.5 million), primarily commitment and letter of credit fees. 
The Group capitalised interest of $42.3 million in 2017 in relation 
to the interest payable on borrowing costs on its capital 
development projects, primarily the Kraken development (2016: 
$55.3 million). 
In June 2017, in line with first oil from Kraken, the Group’s lease 
for the FPSO vessel from Armada Kraken PTE Limited (‘BUMI’) 
commenced. Finance lease interest of $31.3 million has been 
recognised within finance costs. In 2016, $36.5 million of finance 
costs related to the amortisation of put option premium  
related to the Group’s oil hedge portfolio were recognised.  
No corresponding charge existed in 2017 as no put options had 
been used to hedge 2017 production. 
Finance income
Finance income of $2.2 million (2016: $1.4 million) includes  
$1.8 million from the unwind of the discount on financial assets 
(2016: $1.0 million) and $0.4 million of bank interest receivable 
(2016: $0.3 million).
Taxation
The tax credit for 2017 of $66.0 million (2016: $5.2 million tax credit), 
excluding exceptional items, is mainly due to the Ring Fence 
Expenditure Supplement (‘RFES’) on UK activities. 
Remeasurement and exceptional items
Revenue included unrealised losses of $7.7 million in respect of the 
mark to market movement on the Group’s commodity contracts 
(2016: unrealised loss of $51.5 million).
Non-cash impairment charge on the Group’s oil and gas assets 
arising from changes in assumptions combined with lower 
production performance in the North Sea totalled $172.0 million 
(2016: reversal of non-cash impairment of $147.9 million).
Other income and expense included the recognition of the 
accounting for the excess of fair value over consideration of 
$16.1 million associated with the Thistle decommissioning option 
and $10.3 million associated with the accounting impact of the 
acquisition of initial interests in assets from BP and the related 
discounted purchase option valuation of $22.3 million (see note 
29). Other items include a $1.3 million gain from the disposal of 
Ascent Resources loan notes, a $10.3 million charge arising from a 
cost recovery settlement in Malaysia, a $6.4 million charge arising 
from the cancellation of contracts and a $2.8 million provision in 
relation to restricted cash.
A tax credit of $117.0 million (2016: charge of $37.3 million) has 
been presented as exceptional, representing the tax impact of the 
above items, together with a net write-back of $47.2 million of tax 
losses which had been previously impaired.

Earnings per share
The Group’s reported basic loss per share was 5.4 cents  
(2016: earnings per share of 22.7 cents) and reported diluted loss 
per share was 5.4 cents (2016: earnings per share of 22.1 cents). 
Cash flow and liquidity
Net debt at 31 December 2017 amounted to $1,991.4 million, 
including PIK of $90.5 million, compared with net debt of 
$1,796.5 million at 31 December 2016, including PIK of $27.7 million. 
The Group has remained in compliance with financial covenants 
under its debt facilities throughout the year and managing 
ongoing compliance remains a priority. Where necessary or 
appropriate, the Group has and would seek waivers and/or 
consents. The movement in net debt was as follows:
Net debt 1 January 2017 (1,796.5)
Operating cash flows 301.8
Cash capital expenditure (367.6)
Proceeds on disposal of Ascent Resources loan notes 3.6
Net interest and finance costs paid (52.0)

bond and credit facility (‘PIK’) (62.8)
Other movements, primarily net foreign exchange  
loss on cash and debt (17.9)
Net debt 31 December 2017 (1,991.4)
The Group’s reported operating cash flows for the year ended 
31 December 2017 were $301.8 million, down 20.5% compared  
to 2016 ($379.5 million). The main driver for this reduction is the 
reduced contribution from commodity price hedging, where total  
cash flows received in 2017 were $3.6 million as compared to  
$198.8 million for 2016. This reduced cash flow was partially offset 
by the impact of higher market oil prices on revenue and reduced 
operating and general and administrative expenses.

In the North Sea, a total of $252.2 million was spent during the 
year on the Kraken development, primarily related to drilling and 
completing 14 wells across Drill Centres (‘DC’)/2 and 3. Excellent 
drilling performance resulted in the delivery of the wells ahead of 
schedule. In early 2018, EnQuest also agreed renegotiated terms 
for the drilling rig, reducing both the contract duration and day 
rates. Full cycle gross project capital expenditure is now expected 
to be c.$2.3 billion. The remaining 2017 cash capital expenditure is 
primarily the settlement of deferred invoices in respect of the 
Alma/Galia and Scolty/Crathes developments and the Eagle 
discovery.
Balance sheet
The Group’s total asset value has increased by $1,112.5 million to 
$5,038.5 million at 31 December 2017 (2016: $3,926.0 million), 
mainly attributable to the recognition of the $772.0 million Kraken 
FPSO finance lease asset in property, plant and equipment 
(‘PP&E’). Net current liabilities have increased to $377.9 million as 
at 31 December 2017 (2016: $45.1 million), primarily driven by the 
scheduled $270 million RCF amortisation due in October 2018 and 
the impact of the Kraken FPSO finance lease commitments due 
within one year.
Property, plant and equipment (‘PP&E’)
PP&E has increased by $885.2 million to $3,848.6 million at 
31 December 2017 from $2,963.4 million at 31 December 2016 
(see note 10). This increase is explained by the recognition of the 
Kraken FPSO finance lease in June 2017 of $772.0 million, capital 
additions to PP&E of $323.6 million, additions of $124.5 million for 
the acquisition of interests in the Magnus oil field, SVT and 
associated infrastructure assets (see note 29), a net increase of 
$66.2 million for changes in estimates for decommissioning and 
other provisions, including the KUFPEC cost recovery provision, 
offset by depletion and depreciation charges of $229.2 million and 
non-cash impairments of $172.0 million.
The PP&E capital additions during the period, including 
capitalised interest, are set out in the table below:

Intangible oil and gas assets
Intangible oil and gas assets marginally increased to $52.1 million 
at 31 December 2017 from $50.3 million at 31 December 2016 (see 
note 12).
Trade and other receivables
Trade and other receivables have increased by $25.1 million to 
$227.8 million at 31 December 2017 compared with $202.7 million 
at 31 December 2016. The increase relates mainly to the timing of 
crude oil sales increased underlift and higher oil prices, partially 
offset by other working capital movements (see note 15). 
Cash and net debt
1
The Group had $173.1 million of cash and cash equivalents at 
31 December 2017 and $1,991.4 million of net debt, including PIK 
of $90.5 million (2016: $174.6 million of cash and cash equivalents 
and $1,796.5 million of net debt, including PIK of $27.7 million).  
Net debt
1
 comprises the following liabilities:
• $224.1 million principal outstanding on the £155 million retail bond 
(2016: $191.3 million) including $14.9 million of interest capitalised as 
an amount Payable In Kind (‘PIK’) in the year;
• $720.8 million principal outstanding on the high yield bond, 
including capitalised interest (PIK) of $70.8 million pursuant to 
the Restructuring (2016: $677.5 million and $27.5 million 
respectively);
• $1,100.0 million carrying value of credit facility, comprising 
amounts drawn down of $1,095.2 million and PIK interest of 
$4.8 million (2016: $1,037.5 million comprising amounts drawn 
down of $1,037.3 million and PIK interest of $0.2 million);
• $25.6 million relating to the SVT Working Capital Facility (2016: $nil);
• $75.5 million relating to the Mercuria Prepayment Facility 
(2016: $nil);
• $10.0 million outstanding from a trade creditor loan 
(2016: $40.0 million); and
• $8.5 million principal outstanding on the Tanjong Baram 
Project Finance Facility (2016: $24.9 million).
1 Net debt excludes accrued interest and the net-off of unamortised fees  
(see note 19 of the consolidated financial statements).
Provisions
The Group’s decommissioning provision increased by $145.4 million 
to $639.3 million at 31 December 2017 (2016: $493.9 million). The 
movement is explained by additions to Kraken of $63.6 million 
based on drilling and developments carried out in the period, an 
increase of $80.9 million due to changes in estimates (including the 
impact of oil prices and foreign exchange rates) and $11.5 million 
unwinding of discount, partially offset by reductions of $10.6 million 
for decommissioning carried out in the period. 34
EnQuest PLC  Annual Report 2017
Financial Review CONTINUED
Other key movements in provisions during the period include the 
addition of $66.6 million of outstanding contingent consideration 
for the acquisition of the Magnus oil field, SVT and associated 
infrastructure assets from BP completed in December 2017 (see 
note 29) and $10.3 million for PM8/Seligi cost recovery. This is 
largely offset by a $77.8 million reduction for changes in estimates 
and the fair value of cost recovery provisions, combined with 
payments of $9.0 million contingent consideration to Centrica 
pursuant to the Greater Kittiwake Area acquisition agreement and 
$5.5 million for the final settlement due to Cairn under the carry 
agreement (see note 22).
Income tax
The Group had no UK corporation tax or supplementary 
corporation tax liability at 31 December 2017, which remains 
unchanged from 31 December 2016. The income tax asset at 
31 December 2017 represents UK corporation tax receivable in 
relation to non-upstream activities and the income tax payable is 
in relation to the Group’s activities in Malaysia (see note 7).
Deferred tax
The Group’s net deferred tax asset has increased from  
$191.7 million at 31 December 2016 to $335.6 million at 
31 December 2017. The increase is mainly due to the RFES, 
together with the recognition of $9.7 million of previously 
derecognised tax losses. Total UK tax losses carried forward at 
the year end amount to $3,121.3 million (2016: $2,893.7 million) 
(see note 7).
Trade and other payables
Trade and other payables of $446.1 million at 31 December 2017 
are $6.7 million lower than at 31 December 2016 ($452.8 million). 
$367.3 million are payable within one year (2016: $410.2 million) 
and $78.8 million are payable after more than one year  
(2016: $42.6 million). The decrease in current payables mainly 
reflects the settlement of deferred invoices and an $11.9 million 
reduction in the overlift position, offset by accruals (see note 23).
Other financial liabilities
Other current financial liabilities have increased by $16.9 million to 
$61.2 million. The increase primarily relates to mark to market 
movements on the Group’s commodity derivatives following the 
strengthening of the oil price, waiver fees payable to credit facility 
lenders due in March 2018 (previously non-current) and the 
Group’s liability to carry PETRONAS Carigali for its share of 
exploration or appraisal well commitments in relation to the  
PM8/Seligi asset in Malaysia (previously non-current).
Other non-current financial liabilities of $7.1 million (2016: $19.8 
million) relate mainly to the Magnus field liabilities acquired as part 
of the transaction that completed in December 2017 (see note 20). 
Financial risk management
Oil price
The Group is exposed to the impact of changes in Brent crude oil 
prices on its revenue and profits. EnQuest’s policy is to manage 
the impact of commodity prices to protect against volatility and 
allow availability of cash flow for reinvestment in capital 
programmes that are driving business growth. 
In November 2017, the Group entered into an 18-month collar 
structure for the Mercuria Prepayment Facility of $80 million (see 
note 19). Repayment will be in equal monthly instalments over  
18 months, through the delivery of an aggregate of approximately 
1.8 mmbbls of oil. EnQuest will receive the average Brent price 
over each month subject to a floor of $45 per barrel and a cap of 
approximately $64 per barrel. Losses totalling $5.2 million were 
included within unrealised revenue in the income statement.
The marking to market of the Group’s open contracts as at 
31 December 2017 gave rise to a loss of $29.2 million in respect of 
fixed price swap contracts for 4.15 MMbbls of 2018 production at a 
weighted average price of $59.1/bbl (2016: loss of $40.5 million in 
respect of fixed price swap contracts for 5.99 MMbls of 2017 
production at a weighted average price of $51.3/bbl). 
During 2016, the Group entered into commodity hedging 
contracts to hedge a portion of its 2017 production against 
fluctuations in oil prices. This hedging generated cash outflows 
of $0.9 million (including $2.0 million outflow in respect of the 
settlement of December 2016 hedges) while revenue and other 
operating income included a loss of $31.1 million during 2017. 
These amounts were mostly in respect of the settlement of swaps 
in respect of 6.0 MMbbls, plus the maturity of certain other 
commodity derivatives. The Group’s marketing and trading 
activities, which are designed to manage price exposures on 
certain individual cargos, generated $6.7 million of cash, and 
contributed $10.6 million to revenue and other operating income.
Foreign exchange
EnQuest’s functional currency is US Dollars. Foreign currency risk 
arises on purchases and the translation of assets and liabilities 
denominated in currencies other than US Dollars. To mitigate the 
risks of large fluctuations in the currency markets, the hedging 
policy agreed by the Board allows for up to 70% of the non-US 
Dollar portion of the Group’s annual capital budget and operating 
expenditure to be hedged. For specific contracted capital 
expenditure projects, up to 100% can be hedged. 
During 2017, the Group has continued to use an exchange 
structure to manage risk. The first exchange structure was 
entered into in 2016 and allowed the counterparty to elect to 
sell £47.5 million to EnQuest at an exchange rate of $1.4:£1, or 
purchase 1.3 MMbbls of oil at $58/bbl. This structure expired 
on 30 June 2017. The second exchange structure allowed the 
counterparty to elect to sell £66.0 million to EnQuest at an 
exchange rate of $1.2:£1 or purchase 1.5 MMbbls of oil at $60/bbl. 
This structure expired on 31 December 2017. As a result of these 
exchange structures, $4.4 million was recognised within other 
foreign currency contracts and no costs within other operating 
income during the year (2016: $9.3 million and $nil respectively).
EnQuest continually reviews its currency exposures and when 
appropriate looks at opportunities to enter into foreign exchange 
hedging contracts.
Surplus cash balances are deposited as cash collateral against 
in-place letters of credit as a way of reducing interest costs. 
Otherwise cash balances can be invested in short-term bank 
deposits and AAA-rated liquidity funds, subject to Board-approved 
limits and with a view to minimising counterparty credit risks.
Going concern 
The Group closely monitors and manages its funding position and 
liquidity risk throughout the year, including monitoring forecast 
covenant results, to ensure that it has access to sufficient funds 
to meet forecast cash requirements. Cash forecasts are regularly 
produced and sensitivities considered for, but not limited to, 
changes in crude oil prices (adjusted for hedging undertaken by 
the Group), production rates and project timing and costs. These 
forecasts and sensitivity analyses allow management to mitigate 
any liquidity or covenant compliance risks in a timely manner. 
Management has also continued to take action to implement 
cost saving programmes to reduce planned operational, general 
and administrative and capital expenditures in 2017 and 2018. 
At 31 December 2017, the Group had cash and available bank 
facilities of $244.4 million, excluding $26.5 million of cash from 
the ring fenced working capital facility associated with SVT.
The Group’s business plan (‘Base case’), which underpins this 
assessment, assumes Kraken production rates are in line with the 
Group’s production guidance. The Base case has been updated for 
the forward curve and uses an oil price assumption of c.$67/bbl 
throughout 2018 and c.$63/bbl for the first quarter of 2019. This has 
been further stress tested under a plausible downside case 
(‘Downside case’) as described in the viability statement. Both cases 
reflect the bank debt amortisation profile due in the going concern 
period. The Directors consider the Base case and Downside case to 
be an appropriate basis on which to make their assessment. 35
EnQuest PLC  Annual Report 2017
STRATEGIC 
REPORT
CORPORATE 
GOVERNANCE
FINANCIAL 
STATEMENTS
The Group has historically reviewed farm down options and 
continues to do so. The Base case and Downside case indicate 
that the Company is covenant compliant and will be able to 
operate within the headroom of its existing borrowing facilities 
for 12 months from the date of approval of the Annual Report 
and Accounts. 
Should there be any liquidity shortages or covenant breaches due 
to events not included in the Base or Downside cases, the 
Directors believe that a number of mitigating actions, including 
assets sales or other funding options, can be executed 
successfully in the necessary timeframe to meet debt repayment 
obligations as they become due and in order to maintain liquidity. 
Nevertheless, there remains the risk that the Group is unable 
successfully to achieve farm down options, other potential asset 
sales or other funding options. The risk represents a material 
uncertainty that may cast doubt upon the Group’s ability to 
continue to apply the going concern basis of accounting.
Notwithstanding the material uncertainty described above, after 
making enquiries and assessing the progress against the forecast, 
projections and the status of the mitigating actions referred to 
above, the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group 
will be able to continue in operation and meet its commitments as 
they fall due over the going concern period. Accordingly, the 
Directors therefore continue to adopt the going concern basis in 
preparing the financial statements.
Viability statement
The Directors have assessed the viability of the Group over a 
three-year period to March 2021. This assessment has taken into 
account the Group’s financial position as at March 2018, the future 
projections and the Group’s principal risks and uncertainties. The 
Directors’ approach to risk management, their assessment of the 
Group’s principal risks and uncertainties, and the actions 
management are taking to mitigate these risks, are outlined on 
pages 40 to 47. The period of three years is deemed appropriate 
as it provides a sufficient time horizon to assess the performance 
of the Kraken project and covers the period within which the 
Group’s Facility will be largely repaid. Based on the Group’s 
projections, the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the 
Group will be able to continue in operation and meet its liabilities 
as they fall due over the period to March 2021.
The Group’s business plan process has underpinned this 
assessment and has been used as the Base case. The business 
plan process takes account of the Group’s principal risks and 
uncertainties, and has further been stress tested to understand 
the impact on the Group’s liquidity and financial position of 
reasonably possible changes in these risks and/or business plan 
assumptions.
The forecasts which underpin this assessment use the same oil 
price assumption as for the going concern assessment with a 
longer-term price assumption for the viability period being 
aligned to a recent forward curve. The Base case reflects 
significant steps already undertaken to reduce operating and 
capital expenditure. 
For the current assessment, the Directors also draw attention to 
the specific principal risks and uncertainties (and mitigants) 
identified below, which, individually or collectively, could have a 
material impact on the Group’s viability during the period of 
review. In forming this view, it is recognised that such future 
assessments are subject to a level of uncertainty that increases 
with time and, therefore, future outcomes cannot be guaranteed 
or predicted with certainty. The impact of these risks and 
uncertainties, including their combined impact, has been 
reviewed by the Directors and the effectiveness and achievability 
of the potential mitigating actions have been considered.
Oil price volatility
A material decline in oil and gas prices would adversely affect the 
Group’s operations and financial condition. To mitigate oil price 
volatility, the Directors have hedged c.7.5 million barrels of 2018 
production at an average price of c.$62/bbl. As further mitigation, 
the Directors, in line with Group policy, will continue to pursue 
hedging at the appropriate time and price.
Kraken production and related asset disposal
All production and injector wells on the first three Drilling Centres 
(‘DC’) are onstream and are, in aggregate, operating as per the 
Field Development Plan (‘FDP’). Both production processing 
trains are also onstream. Kraken gross production averaged 
around 38,000 Bopd (gross) in the first two months of 2018 and 
has already delivered the targeted 50,000 Bopd (gross) as 
planned. The remaining development wells (DC4) will be drilled 
from Q4 2018 and onstream from Q1 2019, concluding the 
execution of the FDP. On the basis of this performance, and 
subject to delivering on the Group’s plans to further optimise 
production and improving plant uptime, EnQuest expects to 
deliver sustained production rates. The Group has historically 
reviewed farm down options and continues to do so.
Access to funding
The Group’s Facility contains certain covenants (based on the 
ratio of indebtedness incurred under the term loan and revolving 
facility to EBITDA, finance charges to EBITDA, and requirement 
for liquidity testing). Prolonged low oil prices, cost increases and 
production delays or outages could further threaten the Group’s 
liquidity and/or ability to comply with relevant covenants.
The Directors recognise the importance of ensuring medium-term 
liquidity and in particular to protect against potential future 
declines in the oil price. EnQuest has a committed $1.125 billion 
Tranche A Term Loan and a further Tranche B $75 million 
Revolving Credit Facility (collectively the ‘Facility’). Across the 
Facility, $98 million remains available at 31 December 2017. 
In addition, the maturity dates of the $721 million high yield bond 
and the £166 million retail notes (both figures inclusive of the PIK 
notes), have been amended to April 2022, with an option 
exercisable by the Group (at its absolute discretion) to extend the 
maturity date by one year and an automatic further extension of 
the maturity date to October 2023 if the existing Facility is not 
fully repaid or refinanced by October 2020. 
A further condition to the payment of interest on both the high 
yield bond and retail notes in cash is based on, amongst other 
things, the average prevailing oil price (dated Brent future (as 
published by Platts)) for the six-month period immediately 
preceding the day which is one-month prior to the relevant 
interest payment date being at least $65/bbl; otherwise interest 
payable is to be capitalised.
In conducting the viability review, these risks have been taken into 
account in the stress testing performed on the Base case 
described above. 
Specifically the Base case has been subjected to stress testing by 
considering the impact of the following plausible downside risks:
• a 10% discount to the oil price forward curve;
• a 5% increase in operating costs except for fixed costs related 
to the Kraken FPSO; and
• a lower value achieved from the sale of an interest in Kraken.
A scenario has been run illustrating the impact of the above risks 
on the Base case. This plausible Downside case indicates no 
mitigating actions need be undertaken for the Group to be viable 
in the three-year period. 
Notwithstanding the principal risks and uncertainties described 
above, after making enquiries and, assessing the progress against 
the forecast, projections and the status of the mitigating actions 
referred to above, the Directors have a reasonable expectation 
that the Group will be able to continue in operation and meet its 
commitments as they fall due over the viability period ending 
March 2021. Accordingly, the Directors therefore support this 
viability statement. 36

Corporate responsibility review
In our drive for operational excellence  
we remain focused on continual  
improvement through the early  
detection and resolution of issues.
Sandy Fettes, Head of Wells Delivery  
& Interim Head of HSE&A
Health, Safety, Environment and 
Assurance (‘HSE&A’)
The EnQuest Board receives regular 
information on the HSE&A performance 
of the Company, and specifically monitors 
health, safety and environmental reporting 
at each Board meeting. EnQuest  
delivered on its commitment to continual 
improvement in HSE&A performance, 
achieving good year-on-year improvement 
in 2017 with excellent results in many areas 
and meeting the majority of our 
performance targets.
In occupational safety, our Lost Time 
Incident (‘LTI’) performance remained 
strong in both Malaysia and the UK. 
Our Heather, Thistle, Kittiwake and 
Northern Producer assets in the North 
Sea all recorded an LTI-free year. Excellent 
overall workplace safety performance 
was achieved across our Malaysia 
assets, also with zero LTIs. In 2017, we 
were pleased that PM8/Seligi achieved 
seven years without an LTI while our 
Kittiwake platform recorded 12 years 
without an LTI. These milestones were 
achieved against a backdrop of ongoing 
high levels of activity on the assets.
We had no reportable hydrocarbon 
releases during 2017 on our UK operated 
assets, having increased our focus on asset 
integrity and implemented hydrocarbon 
prevention plans across our sites.
Leading targets such as safety-critical 
maintenance deferrals, leadership site 
visits and close out of actions from 
incidents and audits were all met. 
Regulator ratings also improved 
significantly in both Malaysia and the UK.
Evidence of our continued commitment 
to improvement was demonstrated 
through the following outcomes:
UK North Sea:
• Continued focus on coaching our 
workforce to identify, understand and 
control Major Accident Hazards. 
Underpinning this workplace coaching 
were workshops held at DNV GL 
Spadeadam which demonstrate the 
potential consequences of 
hydrocarbon releases;
• Further developing the capabilities of 
elected Safety Representatives and 
Environment Representatives through 
structured engagement sessions;
• Embedding our Life Saving Rules to 
underline the importance of 
maintaining standards and encouraging 
procedural compliance;
• Demonstrating our commitment to 
industry simplification and 
standardisation initiatives by adopting 
industry standard tools for 
observational safety and tool-box talks;
• Transitioning to a new control of work 
tool which enhances both system and 
behavioural compliance; and
• Safely transitioning the Magnus and 
Sullom Voe Oil Terminal (‘SVT’) assets 
from BP, ensuring that all required 
processes, licences and consents were 
in place and available for day one 
operations.
Malaysia:
• Producing the first operations HSE&A 
case for PM8/Seligi; 
• Continuous improvement in our 
external audit compliance with positive 
results from the completion of an 
external audit by both PETRONAS and 
the Department of Occupational Safety 
and Health;
• Ongoing attention to the close-out of 
external regulator audit findings with 
significant improvements to asset 
integrity and management systems;
• Embedding an internal audit process 
within EnQuest Malaysia after its initial 
implementation in Q4 2016;
EnQuest people
Working for EnQuest over the 
last five years has given me the 
opportunity to witness first-hand 
the drive and energy to grow 
and acquire knowledge to be a 
leader in the oil and gas sector. 
Experiencing the evolution and 
continuous improvement of the 
Company makes me proud to be an 
employee. EnQuest has supported 
and developed me throughout 
my career within the HSE&A 
department, initially working as an 
advisor onshore and now offshore 
on Heather Alpha. The platform 
embraces EnQuest values and 
promotes an open reporting culture 
where everyone’s voice is valued.

and purchasing support in prior years, 
the Finance Joint Venture team has 
been moved to Dubai, with the team 
in place and fully operational ahead 
of the year end close out period.
This year also saw the introduction 
of Gender Pay legislation in the UK 
which requires companies to publish 
data on a number of predetermined 
measures. EnQuest is compliant with 
these measures and the associated 
timelines, publishing its Gender Pay 
report on its website, www.enquest.com.
The Gender Pay gap is not the same as 
equal pay, which refers to whether a man 
and a woman are receiving equal pay for 
doing equal work and it is important to 
clarify this point. The Gender Pay gap is 
there to compare the average pay of all 
women compared to the average pay 
of all men in the same organisation – 
regardless of role, seniority, experience 
or contracted working hours. Our 
Gender Pay gap results are influenced 
by factors such as societal norms, more 
males than females working in the oil 
and gas sector (particularly offshore) 
and individual choices in terms of 
self‑selected flexible working practices. 
Having a Gender Pay gap does not mean 
that the pay practices at EnQuest are 
unequal. We do not believe that we have 
an equal pay issue within EnQuest. 
The information collected was based 
on the relevant pay period of:
• The month of April 2017, for the 
purposes of calculating salary earned; 
and
• The year April 2016 to March 2017 for 
the purposes of calculating bonus paid.
The results show that the average rate 
of total pay for women is 38.7% below 
the average rate of total pay for men and 
that the average bonus gap for women 
is 44.9% below the average bonus paid 
for men. On the comparison of median 
total pay and bonus, the percentage 
difference declines to 31.6% on pay and 
23.1% on bonus. During the period
• Demonstrating a commitment to safety 
through a range of contractor safety 
management initiatives, including the 
inaugural annual contractor safety 
forum, held by EnQuest in Malaysia; 
and
• Implementing a number of safety 
awareness programmes, such as 
Monsoon Safety Awareness.
We also completed comprehensive UK 
and Malaysian HSE&A audit programmes, 
with outcomes fed into our 2018 Continual 
Improvement Programme. This underlines 
our focus upon improvement through the 
early detection and resolution of issues.
People
The acquisition of the Magnus oil field 
and SVT assets from BP, announced 
in January 2017 and completed in 
December 2017, meant that our UK staff 
workforce had approximately doubled 
by the end of the year. Consequently, 
much of the focus during the year was on 
the efficient transition of employees to 
EnQuest and safe operations from day 
one. Upon completion, 320 staff joined the 
North Sea business in line with Transfer of 
Undertakings Protection of Employment 
(‘TUPE’) Regulations, with a further 100 
contractors transferring over at the same 
time. The transition has been complex and 
the transition team have systematically 
worked through all matters arising 
with BP to ensure a smooth transfer, 
including consultation with transferring 
staff during 2017. Inductions were run 
for all transferring staff from September 
to ensure that all those impacted 
understood the EnQuest business, how 
we work and how they can contribute 
to EnQuest’s success. Combining these 
staff groups is a great opportunity to 
bolster the North Sea business and 
add depth, particularly offshore.
The successful transition was undertaken 
alongside a continued focus on cost 
management, with the teams undertaking 
a review of activities which could 
be moved to Dubai. Following the 
successful transfer of accounts payable

EnQuest PLC  Annual Report 2017
Corporate Responsibility Review CONTINUED
April 2016 to March 2017, almost an equal 
percentage of women and men received 
a bonus (96% of women and 95% of men). 
The Company conducts regular 
benchmarking exercises to ensure that 
salaries are comparable, regardless 
of gender, and that the recruitment 
process is fair and balanced. However, 
we recognise that we need to work at 
addressing our Gender Pay gap over 
the coming years. Whilst we recognise 
that any improvements of this imbalance 
cannot be resolved immediately, we are 
committed to narrowing the Gender 
Pay gap in EnQuest over time.
We have continued to work on ensuring 
we have the right capabilities across the 
organisation to deliver our business plan. 
As a result, we focused our recruitment 
effort in certain functions, including 
Commercial, Subsurface and Finance. 
Competency levels offshore remain a 
priority in both the UK and Malaysia, with 
ongoing assessments being undertaken 
to ensure that the Group has the required 
capabilities in place. With the safety of 
our people and those we work with a 
priority, we have begun embedding a 
new set of life saving rules across our 
offshore assets in the North Sea. We 
remain committed to ensuring that 
staff can optimise their performance 
through a combination of cascaded 
objectives at the beginning of the year 
that align to our wider Group goals, 
followed by regular line management 
feedback and conversations to measure 
progress towards these goals. During 
the year, we have continued to work on 
succession planning for critical roles in 
the UK and Malaysia, with further work 
planned to continue in this area in 2018. 
In 2017, we have also invested time to 
understand the culture of our business. 
This has been achieved through an 
online survey which was followed up by a 
number of focus groups facilitated by an 
independent specialist company. These 
focus groups included a sample of our 
employees and service providers, covering 
both onshore and offshore groups. We 
have worked through this feedback to 
identify our next steps as we evolve our 
culture and ensure that EnQuest is a 
great place to work. During this time, 
we have continued to run our weekly 
business briefings and town halls and we 
will be putting in place a forum whereby 
employees and the Board will have the 
opportunity for greater interaction.
EnQuest recognises the value of diversity 
in its workforce and is committed to 
diversity, including diversity of skills, 
experience, nationality and gender in its 
appointments to the Board and within 
the executive and senior management 
teams and will continue to be so, 
recruiting individuals on merit and their 
suitability for the role and cognisant of 
the skills and experience of the rest of 
the executive and senior management.
EnQuest remains committed to fair 
treatment of people with disabilities 
in relation to job applications. Full 
consideration is given to applications 
from disabled persons where the 
candidate’s particular aptitudes and 
abilities are consistent with adequately 
meeting the requirement of the job. 
Additionally, EnQuest offers opportunities 
to disabled employees for training, 
career development and promotion. 
In the event of an existing employee 
becoming disabled, it is EnQuest’s policy 
to provide continuing employment 
whenever practicable in the same or 
an alternative position and to provide 
appropriate training to achieve this aim.
Community
EnQuest remains fully committed to active 
community engagement programmes 
across the Group, developing strong 
relationships with partner organisations 
in the North Sea and Malaysia. 
EnQuest is also proud to be an active 
member of Oil Spill Response Limited 
(‘OSRL’), the largest international 
industry-funded cooperative which 
exists to respond to oil spills wherever 
in the world they may occur, by 
providing preparedness, response 
and intervention services.
North Sea
We have continued to raise funds for 
Archway, an Aberdeen-based charity 
which supports young people and 
adults with learning disabilities. In 
2017, we donated more than £7,500 
through team events and activities, 
including participation in the Ride the 
North and Great Aberdeen Run. This 
brings our total fundraising efforts for 
the organisation to £170,000 since we 
began supporting them in 2012. Our 
keen cyclists who took part in the Ride 
the North event also raised £2,580 for 
the Sandpiper Trust which promotes and 
supports initiatives that help improve 
immediate medical care in Scotland.
EnQuest maintained its support to Tullos 
Primary School, also in Aberdeen. Our 
strong relationships with companies in our 
supply chain enables us to give pupils an 
insight into the career opportunities that 
the oil and gas industry can offer them 
in the future. Events included a trip to 
Babcock’s facilities in Aberdeen, where 
the young people had the opportunity 
to sit in the helicopters used to transport 
workers offshore and also to meet 
pilots and engineers. Pupils also visited 
remotely operated vehicle provider i-Tech, 
a division of Subsea 7. EnQuest hosted 
a careers day for pupils at our Annan 
House office in Aberdeen, introducing 
the pupils to colleagues from across 
our technical and functional teams.
Our onshore and offshore charity 
committees also support many local 
organisations across the UK throughout 
the year. One of the most popular 
fundraising activities offshore is through 
the ’Greenie Charts’, with teams raising 
funds through delivering strong safety and 
environmental performance. The offshore 
teams themselves nominate which 
charities will receive a share of the funds 
raised, and in 2017, the Royal National 
Lifeboat Institution, the Children’s Hospice 
Association Scotland and the Brain 
Tumour Charity were among those who 
benefited from their focused efforts.
Having taken operatorship of the Sullom 
Voe Terminal (‘SVT’) in late 2017, we 
look forward to continuing to support 
local charities and community events.  39

We are also committed to the continuing 
protection of the environment around 
the terminal through our support of the 
Shetland Oil Terminal Environmental 
Advisory Group (‘SOTEAG’). Over the 
past 30 years, SOTEAG’s high quality 
marine environmental management 
has helped ensure that Sullom Voe’s 
special geographical and biological 
features remain unspoilt.
Malaysia
Our team in Malaysia continue to be 
committed to supporting their local 
communities. As part of our community 
service project for 2017, EnQuest 
Petroleum Production Malaysia organised 
an event at District 21 Putrajaya with 
Good Samaritan Home. More than 
100 children joined Good Samaritan 
care‑takers, EnQuest employees and their 
families for a day of fun activities, games 
and a special lunch. A wide range of 
donations were also made for the benefit 
of the Home, including furniture, kitchen 
equipment, a water dispenser and phones. 
The children delighted their visitors 
by performing a memorable dance.
Business conduct
EnQuest has a Code of Conduct that it 
requires all personnel to be familiar with. 
The EnQuest Code of Conduct sets out 
the behaviour which the organisation 
expects of its Directors, managers and 
employees, of our suppliers, contractors, 
agents and partners. We are committed 
to conducting ourselves ethically and 
with integrity and to comply with all 
applicable legal requirements.
Our employees and everyone that we 
work with help to create and support our 
reputation, which in turn underpins our 
ability to succeed. This code addresses 
our requirements in a number of areas, 
including the importance of health and 
safety and environmental protection, 
compliance with applicable law, 
anti‑corruption, anti ‑ slavery, addressing 
conflicts of interest, ensuring equal 
opportunities, combatting bullying and 
harassment and the protection of privacy.
The Group’s induction procedures cover 
the Code of Conduct and the Group 
runs both ad hoc and scheduled periodic 
training for personnel to refresh their 
familiarity with relevant aspects of the 
Code of Conduct and specific policies 
and procedures which support it (such as 
the Group’s anti‑ corruption programme).
As part of the Group’s Risk Management 
Framework the Board is supplied annually 
with an ‘assurance map’ to provide the 
Board with an insight into the status 
of the main sources of controls and 
assurance in respect of the Group’s key 
risk areas. Whilst this provides some 
formal assurance as to how the Group 
reinforces its requirements in respect 
of business conduct, the Board also 
recognises the importance of promoting 
the right culture within the Group 
and this remains an area of increased 
focus for the Group. Please see pages 
40 to 47 for further information on how 
the Group manages its key risk areas.
The Code of Conduct also includes 
details of the independent reporting line 
through which any concerns related to 
the Group’s practices or any suspected 
breaches of the Group’s policies and 
procedures can be raised. Where 
concerns are raised (whether through this 
reporting line or otherwise), the General 
Counsel, reporting for this purpose to 
the Chairman of the Audit Committee, 
is required to look into the relevant 
concern and investigate and take action 
as appropriate. Concerns raised in relation 
to potential conflicts of interest and 
safety practices, as well as more routine 
interfaces with regulatory authorities, are 
also reported to the Board and addressed.
The Code of Conduct includes a 
confirmation of EnQuest’s commitments 
to adhere to applicable tax laws (including 
the corporate offence of failure to prevent 
the criminal facilitation of tax evasion) as 
well as the Group’s stance against slavery 
and human trafficking. The Group has zero 
tolerance of such practices and expects 
the same of all with whom it has business 
dealings; for example, in relation to 
procurement, by requiring suppliers to 
confirm their commitment to anti‑ slavery 
before being qualified to supply the 
Group. The Group has supplemented its 
procedures to provide further assurance 
that it is able to identify and manage 
human rights risks in its supply chain 
and has published its modern slavery 
statement on its website at  
www.enquest.com, under corporate 
responsibilty.
Further detail on EnQuest’s Corporate 
Responsibility policies and activities, 
including the area of Business 
Conduct, is available on the Corporate 
Responsibility section of EnQuest’s 
website at www.enquest.com, under 
corporate responsibility. This is 
updated as required during the year. 40

Risks and uncertainties
Management of risks and uncertainties
The Board has articulated EnQuest’s 
vision to be the operator of choice 
for maturing and underdeveloped 
hydrocarbon assets. As EnQuest moves 
from a period of heavy investment to 
one focused on realising value from 
existing resources, it will focus on driving 
improved cash flow and managing 
its capital structure and liquidity.
EnQuest seeks to balance its risk position 
between investing in activities that 
can drive growth with the appropriate 
returns, including any appropriate 
market opportunities that may present 
themselves, and the continuing need 
to remain financially disciplined. This 
financial discipline drives cost efficiency 
and cash flow generation to reduce the 
Group’s debt. In this regard, the Board 
has developed certain strategic tenets to 
guide the Company during the current 
phase of its evolution which link with its 
strategy and appetite for risk. Broadly, 
these reflect a focus by the Company on:
• Maintaining discipline across metrics 
such as financial headroom, leverage 
ratio and gearing;
• Enhancing diversity within our portfolio 
of assets, with a focus on 
underdeveloped producing assets and 
maturing assets with investment 
potential; and
• Ensuring the quality of the investment 
decision-making process.
In pursuit of its strategy, EnQuest has 
to face and manage a variety of risks. 
Accordingly, the Board has established 
a Risk Management Framework to 
enhance effective risk management 
within the following Board-approved 
overarching statement of risk appetite 
(which has been further refined in light 
of the Company’s strategic tenets):
• We make investments and manage the 
asset portfolio against agreed key 
performance indicators consistent with 
the strategic objectives of enhancing 
net cash flow, reducing leverage, 
managing costs and diversifying our 
asset base;
• We seek to avoid reputational risk by 
ensuring that our operational 
processes and practices reduce the 
potential for error to the greatest 
extent practicable;
• We seek to embed a risk culture within 
our organisation corresponding to the 
risk appetite which is articulated for 
each of our principal risks;
• We seek to manage operational risk by 
means of a variety of controls to 
prevent or mitigate occurrence; and
• We set clear tolerances for all material 
operational risks to minimise overall 
operational losses, with zero tolerance 
for criminal conduct.
The Board reviews the Company’s risk 
appetite annually in light of changing 
market conditions and the Company’s 
performance and strategic focus. The 
Executive Committee periodically 
reviews and updates the Group Risk 
Register based on the individual risk 
registers of the business. The Group 
Risk Register, along with an assurance 
mapping exercise and a risk report 
(focused on the most critical risks and 
emerging and changing risk profiles), is 
periodically reviewed by the Board (with 
senior management), to ensure that key 
issues are being adequately identified 
and actively managed. In addition, a 
sub-Committee of the Board has been 
established (the Risk Committee) to 
provide a forum for the Board to review 
selected individual risk areas in greater 
depth (for further information, please see 
the Risk Committee Report on page 89).
The Board, supported by the Audit 
Committee, has reviewed the Group’s 
system of risk management and internal 
control for the period from 1 January 2017 
to the date of this report, and is satisfied 
that it is effective and that the Group 
complies in this respect with the Financial 
Reporting Council’s ‘Guidance on Risk 
Management, Internal Control and Related 
Financial and Business Reporting’.
Key business risks
The Group’s principal risks are those 
which could prevent the business from 
executing its strategy and creating value 
for shareholders or lead to a significant 
loss of reputation. The Board has carried 
out a robust assessment of the principal 
risks facing the Company, including those 
that would threaten its business model, 
future performance, solvency or liquidity.
Cognisant of the Group’s 2016 financial 
restructuring (and consequent strategic 
focus on reducing the Company’s debt 
and strengthening its balance sheet), the 
Board is satisfied that the Group’s risk 
management system works effectively 
in assessing and managing the Group’s 
risk appetite and has supported a 
robust assessment by the Directors of 
the principal risks facing the Group.
Set out on the following pages are:
• The principal risks and mitigations;
• An estimate of the potential impact 
and likelihood of occurrence after the 
mitigation actions, along with how 
these have changed in the past year; 
and
• An articulation of the Group’s risk 
appetite for each of these principal 
risks.
Amongst these, the key risks the 
Group currently faces are a prolonged 
low oil price environment and/or a 
sustained decline in oil prices (see ‘Oil 
Price’ risk on page 45) and materially 
lower than expected production 
performance for a prolonged period, 
particularly at the Kraken field (see 
‘Production’ risk on page 41). 41

Health, safety  
& environment (‘HSE’)
Oil and gas development, production and 
exploration activities are complex and 
HSE risks cover many areas including 
Major Accident Hazards, personal health 
and safety, compliance with regulatory 
requirements, asset integrity issues and 
potential environmental harm.
Potential impact – Medium (2016 
Medium)
Likelihood – Low (2016 Low)
There has been no material change in 
the potential impact or likelihood and 
the Group’s overall record on HSE 
remains robust.
Related KPIs – A, B, C, D, E, F, G
The Group’s principal aim is safe results 
with no harm to people and respect for 
the environment. Should operational 
results and safety ever come into conflict, 
employees have a responsibility to choose 
safety over operational results and are 
empowered to stop operations if required. 
The Group’s desire is to maintain upper 
quartile HSE performance measured 
against suitable industry metrics.
MITIGATION
The Group maintains, in conjunction with 
its core contractors, a comprehensive 
programme of HSE, asset integrity and 
assurance activities and has implemented 
a continual improvement programme, 
promoting a culture of transparency in 
relation to HSE matters. HSE performance 
is discussed at each Board meeting. 
During 2017, the Group continued to focus 
on control of Major Accident Hazards and 
‘Safe Behaviours’ which has resulted in 
significant improvement in safety and 
environmental performance.
In addition, the Group has a positive and 
transparent relationship with the UK 
Health and Safety Executive and 
Department for Business, Energy & 
Industrial Strategy.
EnQuest’s HSE Policy is now fully 
integrated across our operated sites and 
this has enabled an increased focus on 
Health, Safety and the Environment.  
There is a strong assurance programme  
in place to ensure EnQuest complies with 
its Policy and Principles and regulatory 
commitments. 
EnQuest has now extended the 
application of its HSE policy, activities and 
programmes to operatorship of the 
Magnus oil field, Sullom Voe Terminal and 
associated pipelines; see page 36 for 
further details.
RISK APPETITE
Production
The Group’s production is critical to its 
success and is subject to a variety of risks 
including: subsurface uncertainties; 
operating in a mature field environment; 
potential for significant unexpected 
shutdowns; and unplanned expenditure 
(particularly where remediation may be 
dependent on suitable weather  
conditions offshore).
Lower than expected reservoir 
performance or insufficient addition of 
new resources may have a material impact 
on the Group’s future growth.
The Group’s delivery infrastructure in the 
UKCS is, to a significant extent, 
dependent on the Sullom Voe Terminal.
Longer-term production is threatened if 
low oil prices bring forward 
decommissioning timelines.
Potential impact – High (2016 High)
Likelihood – Low (2016 Low)
There has been no material change in the 
potential impact or likelihood.
Whilst reliance on the Sullom Voe Terminal 
has decreased due to the Scolty/Crathes 
and Kraken projects coming onstream, 
production at Alma/Galia has been below 
expectations. Until the Kraken project is at 
full production, there remains a possibility 
that production at the field could be 
below expectations.
Related KPIs – B, C, D, E, G, H
Since production efficiency and meeting 
production targets is core to our business 
and the Group seeks to maintain a high 
degree of operational control over 
production assets in its portfolio, EnQuest 
has a very low tolerance for operational 
risks to its production (or the support 
systems that underpin production).
MITIGATION
The Group’s programme of asset integrity 
and assurance activities provide leading 
indicators of significant potential issues 
which may result in unplanned shutdowns 
or which may in other respects have the 
potential to undermine asset availability 
and uptime. The Group continually 
assesses the condition of its assets and 
operates extensive maintenance and 
inspection programmes designed to 
minimise the risk of unplanned shutdowns 
and expenditure. The Group monitors 
both leading and lagging KPIs in relation 
to its maintenance activities and liaises 
closely with its downstream operators 
to minimise pipeline and terminal 
production impacts.
Production efficiency is continually 
monitored with losses being identified 
and remedial and improvement 
opportunities undertaken as required. 
A continual, rigorous cost focus is also 
maintained.
Life of asset production profiles are 
audited by independent reserves auditors. 
The Group also undertakes regular 
internal reviews. The Group’s forecasts of 
production are risked to reflect 
appropriate production uncertainties.
The Sullom Voe Terminal has a good 
safety record and its safety and 
operational performance levels are 
regularly monitored and challenged by the 
Group and other terminal owners and 
users to ensure that operational integrity 
is maintained. Further, EnQuest expects 
to be well positioned to manage potential 
operational risks related to Sullom Voe 
Terminal having assumed operatorship of 
the terminal and with the workforce 
having transferred with the asset. 
Nevertheless, the Group actively 
continues to explore the potential of 
alternative transport options and 
developing hubs that may provide both 
risk mitigation and cost savings.
The Group also continues to consider new 
opportunities for expanding production.

Project execution and 
delivery
The Group’s success will be partially 
dependent upon the successful execution 
and delivery of development projects. 
Potential impact – High (2016 High)
Likelihood – Low (2016 Low)
The potential impact has been partially 
offset by the Alma/Galia, Scolty/Crathes 
and Kraken projects coming into 
production in 2015, 2016 and 2017 
respectively. 
Further, as the Group focuses on reducing 
its debt, executing new large-scale 
developments is not considered a 
strategic priority in the short term.
Related KPIs – B, D, E, F, G, H
The efficient delivery of new project 
developments has been a key feature of 
the Group’s long-term strategy. Following 
the entry into production of the Alma/Galia, 
Scolty/Crathes and Kraken projects, the 
Company’s exposure to development risks 
has now reduced. 
While the Group necessarily assumes 
significant risk when it sanctions a 
new development (for example, by 
incurring costs against oil price 
assumptions), it requires that risks to the 
efficient implementation of the project are 
minimised.
MITIGATION
The Group has project teams which are 
responsible for the planning and 
execution of new projects with a 
dedicated team for each development. 
The Group has detailed controls, systems 
and monitoring processes in place 
to ensure that deadlines are met, costs are 
controlled and that design concepts and 
the Field Development Plan are adhered 
to and implemented. These are modified 
when circumstances require and only 
through a controlled management of 
change process and with the necessary 
internal and external authorisation and 
communication. The Group also engages 
third party assurance experts to review, 
challenge and, where appropriate, make 
recommendations to improve the 
processes for project management, cost 
control and governance of major projects. 
EnQuest ensures that responsibility for 
delivering time-critical supplier 
obligations and lead times are fully 
understood, acknowledged and 
proactively managed by the most senior 
levels within supplier organisations. 
EnQuest also supports its partners and 
suppliers through the provision of 
appropriate secondees if required.
The Kraken development was sanctioned 
by DECC and EnQuest’s partners in 
November 2013. First oil production  
was achieved on 23 June 2017. Prior to 
sanction, EnQuest identified and 
optimised the development plan using 
EnQuest’s pre-investment assurance 
processes. The Group also continues to 
explore opportunities to reduce capital 
costs and optimise drilling programmes 
with a view to achieving the most cost 
efficient development outcome at  
the field. 
RISK APPETITE
Subsurface risk and 
reserves replacement
Failure to develop its contingent and 
prospective resources or secure new 
licences and/or asset acquisitions and 
realise their expected value.
Potential impact – High (2016 High)
Likelihood – Medium (2016 Medium)
There has been no material change in the 
potential impact or likelihood as oil price 
volatility and a focus on strengthening  
the balance sheet continues to limit 
business development activity to the 
pursuit of reserves enhancing, selective, 
cash-accretive opportunities (please see 
pages 14 to 15).
Low oil prices can potentially affect 
development of contingent and 
prospective resources and can also affect 
reserve certifications.
Related KPIs – B, C, D, E, F, G, H
Reserves replacement is an element of the 
sustainability of the Group and its ability  
to grow. The Group has some tolerance for
the assumption of risk in relation to the 
key activities required to deliver reserves 
growth, such as drilling and acquisitions.
MITIGATION
The Group puts a strong emphasis on 
subsurface analysis and employs 
industry-leading professionals. The Group 
continues to recruit in a variety of 
technical positions which enables it to 
manage existing assets and evaluate the 
acquisition of new assets and licences.
All analysis is subject to internal and, 
where appropriate, external review and 
relevant stage gate processes. All reserves 
are currently externally reviewed by a 
Competent Person. In addition, EnQuest 
has active business development teams 
both in the UK and internationally 
developing a range of opportunities and 
liaising with vendors/government.
The Group continues to consider potential 
opportunities to acquire new production 
resources that meet its criteria.

Inability to fund financial commitments or 
maintain adequate cash flow and liquidity 
and/or reduce costs. 
The Group’s term loan and revolving 
credit facility contains certain financial 
covenants (based on the ratio of 
indebtedness incurred under the term 
loan and revolving facility to EBITDA, 
finance charges to EBITDA and a 
requirement for liquidity testing). 
Prolonged low oil prices, cost increases 
and production delays or outages could 
threaten the Group’s liquidity and/or 
ability to comply with relevant covenants.
Potential impact – High (2016 High)
Likelihood – Medium (2016 Medium)
There has been no material change in the 
potential impact or likelihood; however, 
adhering to the RCF amortisation 
schedule remains partially dependent on 
the successful increase in production at 
the Kraken development, aggregate 
production at other assets being 
materially in line with expectations and no 
significant reduction in oil prices. Further 
information is contained in the going 
concern and viability paragraphs on pages 
34 and 35 of the Financial Review.
Related KPIs – B, C, F, G, H
The Group recognises that significant 
leverage has been required to fund its 
growth as low oil prices have impacted 
revenues. However, it is intent on reducing 
its leverage levels, maintaining liquidity, 
enhancing profit margins, reducing
costs and complying with its obligations 
to finance providers while delivering 
shareholder value, recognising that 
reasonable assumptions relating to 
external risks need to be made in 
transacting with finance providers.
MITIGATION
During the year, the Group completed 
an $80 million crude oil prepayment 
transaction and executed a $37.25 million 
refinancing for its Tanjong Baram project 
in Malaysia; the Group also secured 
consents from its term loan and revolving 
credit facility lenders to waive certain 
financial covenants tests and amend the 
amortisation schedule under the facility. 
These steps, together with other 
mitigating actions available to 
management, are expected to provide 
the Group with sufficient liquidity to 
strengthen its balance sheet for 
longer-term growth.
Ongoing compliance with the financial 
covenants under the Group’s term loan 
and revolving credit facility is actively 
monitored and reviewed. 
Funding from the bonds and revolving 
credit facility is supplemented by 
operating cash inflow from the Group’s 
producing assets. The Group reviews its 
cash flow requirements on an ongoing 
basis to ensure it has adequate resources 
for its needs. 
The Group is continuing to enhance its 
financial position through maintaining a 
focus on controlling and reducing costs 
through supplier renegotiations, assessing 
counterparty credit risk, hedging and 
trading, cost-cutting and rationalisation. 
Where costs are incurred by external 
service providers, the Group actively 
challenges operating costs. The Group 
also maintains a framework of internal 
controls.

Human resources 
The Group’s success continues to be 
dependent upon its ability to attract and 
retain key personnel and develop 
organisational capability to deliver 
strategic growth. Industrial action across 
the sector could also impact on the 
operations of the Group. 
Potential impact – Low (2016 Low)
Likelihood – Medium (2016 Low)
The impact has remained static due to low 
oil prices impacting the buoyancy of the 
employment market. The likelihood has 
increased due to the erosion in value of 
long-term share-based incentive plans.
Related KPIs – A, B, C, D, E, F, G
As a low-cost, lean organisation, the 
Group relies on motivated and high 
quality employees to achieve its targets 
and manage its risks. 
The Group recognises that the benefits of 
a lean and flexible organisation require 
agility to assure against the risk of skills 
shortages.
MITIGATION
The Group has established an able and 
competent employee base to execute its 
principal activities. In addition to this, the 
Group seeks to maintain good 
relationships with its employees and 
contractor companies and regularly 
monitors the employment market to 
provide remuneration packages, bonus 
plans and long-term share-based incentive 
plans that incentivise performance and 
long-term commitment from our 
employees to the Group.
We recognise that our people are critical to 
our success and so are continually evolving 
our end-to-end people management 
processes, including recruitment and 
selection, career development and 
performance management. This ensures 
that we have the right person for the job 
and that we provide appropriate training, 
support and development opportunities 
with feedback to drive continuous 
improvement whilst delivering safe results. 
The culture of the Group is an area of 
increased focus given the rapid growth of 
the workforce as we absorb a significant 
number of personnel into the business with 
the acquisition of operating interests in the 
Magnus field and the Sullom Voe Oil 
Terminal. See page 55 for how the Board is 
addressing this. 
The Group also maintains 
market-competitive contracts with key 
suppliers to support the execution of work 
where the necessary skills do not exist 
within the Group’s employee base. The 
Group recognises that there is a Gender 
Pay gap within the organisation but that 
there is no issue with equal pay for the 
same tasks. EnQuest aims to attract the 
best talent, regardless of gender. 
The focus on executive and senior 
management retention, succession 
planning and development remains an 
important priority for the Board. It is a 
Board-level priority that executive and 
senior management possess the 
appropriate mix of skills and experience  
to realise the Group’s strategy; succession 
planning therefore remains a key priority.

RISK APPETITE
Oil price
A material decline in oil and gas prices 
adversely affects the Group’s operations 
and financial condition.
Potential impact – High (2016 High)
Likelihood – Medium (2016 High)
There has been no material change in  
the potential impact; the likelihood has 
decreased due to rising/stabilising  
oil prices.
Related KPIs – B, D, E, F, G, H
The Group recognises that considerable 
exposure to this risk is inherent to its 
business.
MITIGATION
This risk is being mitigated by a number 
of measures including hedging oil price, 
renegotiating supplier contracts, reducing 
costs and commitments and 
institutionalising a lower cost base.
The Group monitors oil price sensitivity 
relative to its capital commitments and 
has a policy which allows hedging of its 
production. As at 19 March 2018, the 
Group had hedged approximately 
7.5 million bbls for 2018 at a price of 
approximately $62/bbl. This ensures that 
the Group will receive a minimum oil price 
for its production.
In order to develop its resources, the 
Group needs to be able to fund the 
required investment. The Group will 
therefore regularly review and implement 
suitable policies to hedge against the 
possible negative impact of changes in oil 
prices while remaining within the limits set 
by its term loan and revolving credit 
facility.
The Group has established an in-house 
trading and marketing function to enable 
it to enhance its ability to mitigate the 
exposure to volatility in oil prices.
Further, as described above, the Group’s 
focus on production efficiency supports 
mitigation of a low oil price environment.
RISK APPETITE
Fiscal risk and 
government take
Unanticipated changes in the regulatory 
or fiscal environment can affect the 
Group’s ability to deliver its 
strategy/business plan and potentially 
impact revenue and future developments.
Potential impact – High (2016 High)
Likelihood – Medium (2016 Medium)
There has been no material change in the 
potential impact or likelihood.
Related KPIs – E, G
The Group faces an uncertain 
macro-economic and regulatory 
environment. 
Due to the nature of such risks and their 
relative unpredictability, it must be 
tolerant of certain inherent exposure.
MITIGATION
It is difficult for the Group to predict the 
timing or severity of such changes. 
However, through Oil & Gas UK and other 
industry associations, the Group engages 
with government and other appropriate 
organisations in order to keep abreast of 
expected and potential changes; the 
Group also takes an active role in making 
appropriate representations.
All business development or investment 
activities recognise potential tax 
implications and the Group maintains 
relevant internal tax expertise.
At an operational level, the Group has 
procedures to identify impending changes 
in relevant regulations to ensure legislative 
compliance.
RISK APPETITE
Joint venture partners
Failure by joint venture parties to fund 
their obligations.
Dependence on other parties where the 
Group is not the operator.
Potential impact – Medium (2016 Medium)
Likelihood – Medium (2016 Medium)
There has been no material change in the 
potential impact or likelihood; however, 
due to the assumption of operatorship at 
Sullom Voe Terminal, the Group has now 
assumed exposure to a larger number of 
counterparties.
Related KPIs – C, D, E, F, G
The Group requires partners of high 
integrity. It recognises that it must accept 
a degree of exposure to the 
creditworthiness of partners and evaluates 
this aspect carefully as part of every 
investment decision.
MITIGATION
The Group operates regular cash call and 
billing arrangements with its co-venturers 
to mitigate the Group’s credit exposure at 
any one point in time and keeps in regular 
dialogue with each of these parties to 
ensure payment. Risk of default is 
mitigated by joint operating agreements 
allowing the Group to take over any 
defaulting party’s share in an operated 
asset and rigorous and continual 
assessment of the financial situation of 
partners.
The Group generally prefers to be the 
operator. The Group maintains regular 
dialogue with its partners to ensure 
alignment of interests and to maximise 
the value of joint venture assets.

Risks and uncertainties CONTINUED
RISK APPETITE
Competition
The Group operates in a competitive 
environment across many areas, including 
the acquisition of oil and gas assets, the 
marketing of oil and gas, the procurement 
of oil and gas services and access to 
human resources.
Potential impact – Medium (2016 Medium)
Likelihood – Medium (2016 Medium)
There has been no material change in 
the impact or likelihood.
Related KPIs – C, D, E, F, H
The Group operates in a mature industry 
with well-established competitors and 
aims to be the leading operator in the 
sector; it thus has a high appetite for 
this risk.
MITIGATION
The Group has strong technical and 
business development capabilities to 
ensure that it is well positioned to identify 
and execute potential acquisition 
opportunities.
The Group maintains good relations with 
oil and gas service providers and 
constantly keeps the market under review.
RISK APPETITE
Portfolio concentration
The Group’s assets are concentrated in 
the UK North Sea around a limited 
number of infrastructure hubs and existing 
production (principally only oil) is from 
mature fields. This amplifies exposure to 
key infrastructure (including aging 
pipelines and terminals), political/fiscal 
changes and oil price movements.
Potential impact – High (2016 Medium)
Likelihood – Medium (2016 Low)
The acquisition of an interest in the 
Magnus oil field and Sullom Voe Terminal 
(and associated pipelines) has elevated 
this risk in the long term (by further 
concentrating the Group’s portfolio in 
the UK North Sea). In addition, although 
production from Kraken represents a new 
production hub for the Group, it does 
further extend geographic concentration 
of the Group’s production in the UK 
North Sea.
Related KPIs – B, C, D, E
Although the extent of portfolio 
concentration is moderated by production 
generated internationally, the majority of 
the Group’s assets remain relatively 
concentrated in the UK North Sea and 
therefore this risk remains intrinsic to the 
Group.
MITIGATION
This risk is mitigated in part through 
acquisitions. For all acquisitions, the 
Group uses a number of business 
development resources to evaluate and 
transact acquisitions in a commercially 
sensitive matter. This includes performing 
extensive due diligence (using in-house 
and external personnel) and actively 
involving executive management in 
reviewing commercial, technical and other 
business risks together with mitigation 
measures.
The Group also constantly keeps its 
portfolio under rigorous review and, 
accordingly, actively considers the 
potential for making disposals and 
divesting, executing development 
projects, making international acquisitions 
and expanding hubs where such 
opportunities are consistent with the 
Group’s focus on enhancing net revenues, 
generating cash flow and strengthening 
the balance sheet.
The acquisition of the Greater Kittiwake 
Area in 2014 which produces via the 
Forties Pipeline System (‘FPS’) and the 
start-up of Alma/Galia and Kraken which 
produce to shuttle tankers reduced the 
Group’s prior concentration to the Brent 
Pipeline System (‘BPS’) and the Sullom Voe 
Terminal. Although, due to successful 
completion of the Group’s acquisition of 
the Magnus field and Sullom Voe Terminal 
from BP, the Group will see a further 
concentration in Sullom Voe. As the 
Magnus field produces via the Ninian 
Pipeline System (‘NPS’) this will not 
concentrate risk further in BPS. It should 
also be noted that the Heather and Broom 
fields also produce via NPS. Although the 
Group has concentration risk at Sullom 
Voe Terminal, taking operatorship of the 
terminal will put the Group in a position of 
more direct control of such risk.

RISK APPETITE
International business
While the majority of the Group’s activities 
and assets are in the UK, the international 
business is still material. The Group’s 
international business is subject to the 
same risks as the UK business (e.g. 
HSE&A, production and project 
execution); however, there are additional 
risks that the Group faces including 
security of staff and assets, political, 
foreign exchange and currency control, 
taxation, legal and regulatory, cultural and 
language barriers and corruption.
Potential impact – Medium (2016 Medium)
Likelihood – Medium (2016 Medium)
There has been no material change in the 
impact or likelihood.
Related KPIs – A, D, E, F, G, H
In light of its long-term growth strategy, 
the Group seeks to expand and diversify 
its production (geographically and in 
terms of quantum); as such, it is tolerant of 
assuming certain commercial risks which 
may accompany the opportunities it 
pursues. 
However, such tolerance does not impair 
the Group’s commitment to comply with 
legislative and regulatory requirements in 
the jurisdictions in which it operates. 
Opportunities should enhance net 
revenues and facilitate strengthening of 
the balance sheet. 
MITIGATION
Prior to entering a new country, EnQuest 
evaluates the host country to assess 
whether there is an adequate and 
established legal and political framework 
in place to protect and safeguard first its 
expatriate and local staff and, second, any 
investment within the country in question.
When evaluating international business 
risks, executive management reviews 
commercial, technical and other business 
risks together with mitigation and how 
risks can be managed by the business on 
an ongoing basis.
EnQuest looks to employ suitably 
qualified host country staff and work with 
good quality local advisers to ensure it 
complies within national legislation, 
business practices and cultural norms 
while at all times ensuring that staff, 
contractors and advisers comply with 
EnQuest’s business principles, including 
those on financial control, cost 
management, fraud and corruption.
Where appropriate, the risks may be 
mitigated by entering into a joint venture 
with partners with local knowledge and 
experience.
After country entry, EnQuest maintains a 
dialogue with local and regional 
government, particularly with those 
responsible for oil, energy and fiscal 
matters, and may obtain support from 
appropriate risk consultancies. When 
there is a significant change in the risk 
to people or assets within a country, the 
Group takes appropriate action to 
safeguard people and assets.
RISK APPETITE
IT security and 
resilience
The Group is exposed to risks arising from 
interruption to, or failure of, IT 
infrastructure. The risks of disruption to 
normal operations range from loss in 
functionality of generic systems (such as 
email and internet access) to the 
compromising of more sophisticated 
systems that support the Group’s 
operational activities. These risks could 
result from malicious interventions such  
as cyber-attacks.
Potential impact – Medium  
(2016 N/A)
Likelihood – Low (2016 N/A)
Related KPIs – A, B
The Group endeavours to provide a 
secure IT environment that is able to resist 
and withstand any attacks or unintentional 
disruption that may compromise sensitive 
data, impact operations or destabilise its 
financial systems; it has a very low 
appetite for this risk. 
MITIGATION
The Group has established IT capabilities 
and endeavours to be in a position to 
defend its systems against disruption or 
attack.
The Risk Committee undertook an analysis 
of cyber security risks in 2017, recognising 
it is one of the Group’s key focus areas. 
Work on assessing the cyber security 
environment and implementing 
improvements as necessary will be 
continuing during 2018.

EnQuest PLC  Annual Report 2017
Chairman’s letter
Dear Fellow Shareholder
On behalf of the Board of Directors (the ‘Board’), I am pleased 
to introduce EnQuest’s Corporate Governance Report in this, 
my first full year as Chairman of the Company.
Over the past 12 months, the Board of Directors has focused on:
• The progress of the Kraken development and its transition to 
a producing asset, with the resultant operational, financial 
and accounting impacts;
• The successful completion of the Magnus oil field (‘Magnus’) 
and Sullom Voe Oil Terminal (‘SVT’) acquisition, assurance of 
EnQuest’s capability to deliver safe operations at these 
assets and an assessment of the accounting and control 
implications arising upon completion and from ongoing 
operatorship of these assets;
• Ongoing development and implementation of the Group’s 
Risk Management Framework; 
• Board and senior management succession planning, 
including the recruitment and induction of three new 
Non-Executive Directors; and
• The Company’s strategic vision and direction.
Corporate governance
The Board believes that the manner in which it conducts its 
business is important and it is committed to delivering the 
highest standards of corporate governance for the benefit  
of all of its stakeholders. EnQuest’s Company values underpin  
a working environment where people are safe, creative and 
passionate, with a relentless focus on results. During 2017, the 
Risk Committee, established in 2016, was fully embedded into 
the governance structure of the Company. The primary purpose 
of the Risk Committee is to provide a forum for in-depth 
examination of non-financial risk areas (financial risk being within 
the scope of the Audit Committee) and we have this year added 
a separate Report from the Risk Committee Chairman, which 
can be found on page 89. In addition, the Group’s Code of 
Conduct was amended, including the provision of specific 
guidance on the anti-facilitation of tax evasion. 
The following pages provide information on the operation of 
the Board and its Committees. A summary of their work is found 
on page 58 and the individual reports are on pages 60-65 
(Audit), pages 66-86 (Remuneration), pages 87-88 (Nomination) 
and page 89 (Risk).
EnQuest’s governance framework also contains several 
non-Board Committees which provide advice and support to 
the Chief Executive on the development, implementation and 
monitoring of the Group’s strategy, including an Executive 
Committee, Operations Committee and Investment Committee.
Board composition and succession planning
The Board regularly considers how it operates and whether 
there is an appropriate composition and mix around the Board 
table. Rotation of, and succession for, the Directors is kept 
under review by the Nomination Committee, which is also 
reviewing the succession planning processes in place in relation 
to senior executives. More information on the work of the 
Nomination Committee can be found on pages 87 to 88.
In line with our managed approach to Board composition, I was 
delighted to welcome three Non-Executive Directors to the 
Company. After rigorous search processes, led by an external 
advisor, (see page 87 for more information), Carl Hughes was 
appointed on 1 January 2017, John Winterman on 7 September 
2017 and Laurie Fitch on 8 January 2018. Both Carl and John 
joined the Audit, Risk and Remuneration Committees and Laurie 
the Risk and Remuneration Committees. All bring their 
extensive and varied experience covering financial services,  
the energy industry and capital markets to the Company.  
Their biographies can be found on page 51.
I would like to thank Philip Nolan, who stepped down as a 
Non-Executive Director in July 2017 for his valuable contribution 
to the Company’s development over the past five years. I would 
also like to thank Neil McCulloch, who stepped down as Chief 
Operating Officer and Executive Director in December 2017, for 
his unstinting contribution to EnQuest during a challenging 
period for both the Company and industry.
The Board has focused on ensuring  
the Group’s governance and control 
processes are appropriate for the next 
phase of the Company’s development. 55

Board evaluation
The Board held an internal evaluation in 2017 and identified a 
number of areas for consideration, which are summarised on 
page 58. In addition, the Senior Independent Director 
conducted a review of my performance and this is also found 
on page 58. The last externally facilitated Board evaluation took 
place in 2015 and it is the intention of the Board to hold another 
in 2018.
Corporate responsibility
The Company’s corporate responsibility is focused on five main 
areas. These are Health and Safety, People, Environment, 
Business Conduct and Community. The Board has approved 
the Company’s overall approach to corporate responsibility and 
specific developments and updates in each are brought to the 
Board’s attention when appropriate.
The Board receives regular information on the performance of 
the Company in these areas, and specifically monitors health 
and safety and environmental reporting at each Board meeting. 
The Company’s Health, Safety, Environmental and Assurance 
(‘HSE&A’) Policy is reviewed by the Board annually and all 
incidents, forward-looking indicators and significant HSE&A 
programmes are discussed by the Board. We report on these 
areas specifically on page 36.
Culture
The culture of the Company was a key consideration for the 
Board in 2017 and, as detailed in the Corporate responsibility 
review on page 38, the Company conducted an online staff 
culture survey. The results of the survey have been discussed at 
Board level and the Board continues to monitor the resulting 
actions and activities with interest. This is especially important 
as the acquisition of Magnus and SVT in December 2017 
increased our workforce. We believe that engaged and 
committed staff are integral to the delivery of the Company’s 
business plan.

Strategy and risk management
The Board continued to provide strategic guidance to executive 
management throughout the year, which culminated in 
EnQuest’s annual Board strategy day in October 2017. During 
2017, the Board reviewed and refined the presentation of the 
Company’s purpose, vision, strategy and business model (see 
page 04. In addition, a number of tenets were developed to 
guide the Company in its pursuit of its strategy and in 
accordance with the Group’s appetite for risk within its Risk 
Management Framework. 
The Board, in particular through the work of the Risk Committee, 
has also been active in supporting the evolution of the Group’s 
Risk Management Framework and certain specific controls (see 
pages 40 and 89). In 2018, we will continue to build on our 
governance processes and strategic priorities as outlined on the 
following pages.

Leadership
The long-term success of the Company is the collective responsibility 
of the Board.
The role of the Board
The Board is the custodian of the Company’s values, its long-term 
vision and provides strategic direction and guidance for the 
Company in order to deliver long-term shareholder value.
The Board is responsible for:
• The Group’s overall strategy;
• Review of business plans and trading performance;
• Approval of major capital investment projects;
• Examination of acquisition opportunities and divestment 
policies;
• Review of significant financial and operational issues;
• Review and approval of the Company’s financial statements;
• Oversight of control and risk management systems (supported 
by the Audit and Risk Committees); and
• Succession planning and appointments (supported by the 
Nomination Committee).
The Board held six scheduled Board meetings in the year ended 
31 December 2017, four of which were held at the Company’s 
registered office in London, one in the Aberdeen office and 
one was held offsite in conjunction with the Company’s annual 
strategy day in October. In addition, the Board held a number 
of further Board meetings throughout the year. In total there 
were an additional eight Board meetings, primarily focused on 
the Kraken development and the acquisition of the Magnus 
oil field (‘Magnus’) and Sullom Voe Oil Terminal (‘SVT’), which 
were all fully attended. All Directors are expected to attend 
scheduled Board and relevant Committee meetings and the 
Company’s AGM. Details of Board and Committee membership 
and attendance at scheduled meetings can be found on page 57.
All Directors are covered by the Company’s Directors’ and 
Officers’ insurance policy.
A clear division of responsibilities
There is a clear division between the role of the Chairman 
and the Chief Executive; this has been set out in writing and 
agreed by the Board. The Chairman was independent upon 
his appointment to the Board, and the Board continues to 
consider him to be an independent Non-Executive Director. 
The Chairman is responsible for the leadership of the Board, 
setting the Board agenda and ensuring the overall effective 
working of the Board. In 2017 the Chairman visited several of 
the Company’s leading shareholders and proposes to do so 
again in 2018. The Chief Executive is accountable and reports 
to the Board. His role is to develop strategy in consultation 
with the Board, to execute that strategy following presentation 
to, and consideration and approval by, the Board and to 
oversee the operational management of the business.
The role of the Non-Executive Directors
The Non-Executive Directors combine broad business and 
commercial experience from oil and gas and other industry 
sectors. They bring independence, external skills and objective 
judgement, and constructively challenge the actions of senior 
management. This is critical for providing assurance that the 
Executive Directors are exercising good judgement in delivery 
of strategy and decision making. The Board considers that all 
the Non-Executive Directors continue to remain independent 
and free from any relationship that could affect, or appear 
to affect, their independent judgement. Information on the 
skills and experience of the Non-Executive Directors can 
be found in the Board biographies on pages 50 to 51.
The Chairman holds one-to-one and group meetings with the 
Non-Executive Directors, without the Executive Directors 
present, at least once a year.
The role of the Senior Independent Director
The Senior Independent Director (‘SID’) is available to 
shareholders if they have concerns where contact through the 
normal channels of the Chairman, the Chief Executive or other 
Executive Directors has failed to resolve an issue or where 
such contact is inappropriate. In his role as the SID, Helmut 
Langanger runs the annual review of the performance of the 
Chairman and has recently led a shareholder consultation 
with the Company’s major shareholders regarding the 
remuneration of the Chief Financial Officer and certain 
production and reserves growth targets relevant to the 
Company’s PSP share scheme. See pages 66 to 67 within the 
Directors’ Remuneration Report for more information on this 
consultation, which contributed to the proposal for amending 
the remuneration policy to be put to a vote at the forthcoming 
Annual General Meeting (‘AGM’) of the Company. He continues 
to provide a sounding board for the Chairman as well as act 
as an intermediary with other Directors when necessary.
Company Secretary
The Company Secretary is responsible for advising the Board, 
through the Chairman, on all Board procedures and governance 
matters. In addition, each Director has access to the advice and 
services of the Company Secretary. The Company Secretary is 
instrumental in facilitating the induction of new Directors, most 
recently Carl Hughes, John Winterman and Laurie Fitch, and 
assists with the ongoing training and development of the Board.
Effectiveness
Board composition and changes
The Nomination Committee, as one of its duties, regularly 
reviews the structure, size and composition of the Board. At the 
date of this Report there are eight Directors, consisting of two 
Executive Directors and six Non-Executive Directors (including 
the Chairman). As explained in the Chairman’s Statement, Philip 
Nolan and Neil McCulloch stepped down from the Board in July

Board activities during the year
How the Board operates
During 2017, the Board held six scheduled meetings and a number 
of ad hoc meetings were arranged to deal with matters arising 
between scheduled meetings, in particular in relation to the 
completion of Kraken and the acquisition of Magnus and SVT. 
Scheduled Board meetings are preceded by a day of Committee 
meetings and, when required, technical reviews which allow 
for an in-depth review on a particular topic of interest, such as 
well performance, project updates and drilling. This pattern of 
meetings is intended to support the Board’s focus on strategic 
and long-term matters, while ensuring that it discharges its 
monitoring and oversight role effectively through intensive 
high quality discussions and high quality information flow.
All Board papers are published via an online Board portal 
system. This offers a fast, secure and reliable method of 
distribution, which helps lower the Company’s environmental 
impact through the reduction of printing and lowers costs 
associated with printing and postage. Board agendas are 
drawn up by the Company Secretary in conjunction with the 
Chairman and with agreement from the Chief Executive. Board 
members also receive a monthly report on performance and 
updates on major projects, irrespective of a meeting taking 
place, which allows them to monitor performance regularly.
Board agenda and key activities throughout 2017

Corporate Governance Statement CONTINUED
Board Committees
The Board delegates a number of responsibilities to its Audit 
Committee, Remuneration Committee, Nomination Committee 
and Risk Committee. Membership for each Committee is found 
on page 57. The Chairman of each Committee reports formally 
to the Board on its proceedings after each meeting and makes 
recommendations that it deems appropriate to the Board for its 
consideration and approval. There are formal terms of reference 
for each Committee, approved by the Board. The terms of 
reference for each of these Committees set out the scope of 
authority of the Committee, satisfy the requirements of the Code 
and are reviewed internally on an ongoing basis by the Board. 
Copies of the terms of reference are available on the Company’s 
website www.enquest.com, under Corporate Governance.
The Committees are provided with all necessary resources to 
enable them to undertake their duties in an effective manner. 
The Company Secretary acts as secretary to the Committees, and 
minutes of all Committee meetings are available to all Directors.
In addition to the four Board Committees, EnQuest has several 
non-Board Committees, which assist the Chief Executive in 
the development, implementation and monitoring of strategy. 
These include the Executive Committee, Operations Committee, 
Investment Committee and a quarterly HSE&A Review.
Delegation of authority
Responsibility levels are communicated throughout the Group  
as part of the business management system and through an 
authority matrix which sets out, inter alia, delegated authority 
levels, segregation of duties and other control procedures. 
Changes are approved by the Board, most recently in January 
2018 when the authorities matrix was updated to include the 
acquisition of Magnus and SVT.
Board performance evaluation
Each year the Board is required to carry out an evaluation of its 
own effectiveness as required by the Code. The review in 2017 
was carried out internally. The Chairman met with each Director 
individually and Directors were also asked to complete a 
questionnaire.
Key themes which arose from the evaluation included:
• Strategy;
• Internal control, risk management and governance;
• Administration, support and development;
• Membership and proceedings; and
• Interaction with shareholders and stakeholders.
The results of the evaluation were discussed at the January 2018 
Board meeting and it was concluded that the Board and 
Committees were well constituted and had demonstrated good 
performance over the year. It was considered that the 
collaborative Board environment encouraged open debate and 
challenge when appropriate.
A number of topics were debated which have now been worked 
into the Board agenda for 2018. The most significant of these are to:
• Further evolve the Board’s approach to strategy;
• Ensure Board training and development is addressed; 
• Continue to plan for an orderly Board rotation, especially in 
light of the proposed Corporate Governance Code changes; 
and
• Progress activities relating to the development of the senior 
management team.
The Board appreciates the extent of access to senior 
management and the technical review process that operates 
the day before the Board meetings.
The Non-Executive Directors, led by the SID, also carried out a 
performance evaluation of the Chairman and concluded that the 
Chairman had performed well over the year. His allocation of time 
to the Company and encouragement of all viewpoints in Board 
meetings was appreciated by his fellow Non-Executive Directors. 
Induction, information and support
The Directors may consult with the Company Secretary at any 
time on matters related to their role on the Board.
On joining EnQuest, Non-Executive Directors receive a full and 
tailored induction to the Company. The induction programme 
consists of a comprehensive briefing pack, which includes Group 
structure details, the constitution of the Company, the Group 
governance map, a guide to Directors’ duties, terms of reference 
of each Committee, Group policies and the Company’s authorities 
matrix. In addition to this, each Director receives an introduction 
to the Company’s resource centre (including all external 
communications, such as investor presentations, reports and 
corporate responsibility reports) and a schedule of one-to-one 
meetings with each of the Executive Directors, members of senior 
management and external advisers. Visits to the Aberdeen and 
overseas offices are also arranged as appropriate.
All Non-Executive Directors have access to the Company’s senior 
management between Board meetings and the Board aims to 
hold at least one meeting each year in one of the business units to 
allow Non-Executive Directors to meet and engage with local 
staff. In addition, the continuing development of Board members 
is supported through regular briefings on key business, industry, 
governance and regulatory developments which in 2017 included 
training on corporate governance reform, preventing the 
facilitation of tax evasion and new IFRS accounting standards. 
Board meetings are also preceded by informal Board dinners 
which provide the Board an opportunity to discuss a broad range 
of issues relevant to the Group amongst themselves and with 
senior management. Individual Directors have also hosted 
breakfast meetings with staff to exchange views and information. 
The Chairman monitors the breadth of knowledge, skills and 
experience of the Board and its Committees to ensure that they 
can fulfil their obligations.
Accountability
Conflicts of interest
The Company has established procedures in place through the 
Articles of Association and the Company’s Code of Conduct 
which identify and, where appropriate, manage conflicts or 
potential conflicts of interest with the Company’s interests. 
In accordance with the Directors’ interests’ provisions in the 
Companies Act 2006, all the Directors are required to submit 
details to the Company Secretary of any situations which 
may give rise to a conflict, or potential conflict, of interest. 
The Board is satisfied that formal procedures are in place to 
ensure that authorisation for potential and actual conflicts 
of interest are operated efficiently and considers the issue 
of conflicts at the start of every Board meeting. In addition, 
the Directors are required to obtain the approval of the 
Chairman before accepting any further appointments.
Anti-bribery and corruption
The Company is committed to behaving fairly and ethically in all 
of its endeavours and has policies which cover anti-bribery and 
corruption. The overall anti-bribery and corruption programme is 
reviewed annually by the Board and a corruption risk awareness 
email is sent out annually by the Chief Executive reminding staff 
of their obligations and also to prompt them to complete an 
obligatory online anti-corruption training course. In 2017, staff were 
also advised of their obligations with regard to anti-facilitation 
of tax evasion, alongside which the Code of Conduct was 
updated and distributed. In January 2018, a new anti-facilitation 
of tax evasion module was added to the training course. 59

The Company also encourages staff to escalate any concerns and, 
to facilitate this, provides an external ‘speak-up’ reporting line 
which is available to all staff in the UK, Malaysia and the UAE. 
Where concerns are raised, these are investigated by the 
Company’s General Counsel and reported to the Audit Committee.
Risk
EnQuest has continued throughout the year to implement 
and develop its comprehensive Risk Management 
Framework, and has conducted a robust assessment of 
the principal risks facing the Group; see pages 40 to 47 of 
the Strategic Report for further information. In addition, 
the work of the Risk Committee is reported on page 89.
The Audit Committee remains responsible for the following risk 
management related tasks:
• Reviewing the effectiveness of the Company’s internal controls 
and risk management systems;
• Reviewing and approving the statements to be included in the 
Annual Report concerning internal controls and risk 
management; and
• Monitoring and reviewing the effectiveness of the Company’s 
internal audit capability in the context of the Company’s 
overall risk management system.
Remuneration
The work of the Remuneration Committee is set out in the Annual 
Report on pages 66 to 86.
Relations with shareholders
Engagement with shareholders
EnQuest maintained an active and constructive dialogue with its 
shareholders throughout the year through a planned programme 
of investor relations activities. In 2017, the Chairman and the 
Company’s SID again offered to engage with institutional 
investors on corporate governance, remuneration or indeed 
any other matters and a number of such meetings were held 
during the year. The Board was updated on the content of 
those meetings as they are routinely updated on investor 
feedback by the Company’s Investor Relations team, which 
keeps the Board informed of broker and analysts’ views, and 
also presents a paper at each Board meeting. The Chairman 
and the SID also engaged with a number of major shareholders 
in a consultation exercise summarised on pages 66 to 67.
EnQuest’s Investor Relations team and Company Secretarial 
department field daily queries from shareholders and analysts and 
there is a section of the website dedicated to shareholders which 
can be found under Investors at www.enquest.com. EnQuest’s 
registrars, Link Market Services, previously branded as Capita 
Asset Services, also have a team available to answer shareholder 
queries in relation to technical aspects of their holdings, such as 
shareholding balances. 
All of the Company’s financial results presentations are also 
available on the Company’s website and shareholders can register 
on the website to receive email alerts.
Across 2017, numerous investor and broker sales team and 
analyst meetings were held, including presentations at investor 
conferences and results. Results meetings are followed by investor 
roadshows with existing and potential new investors. Executive 
Directors and other members of management routinely hold 
meetings in London, Edinburgh and Stockholm, where EnQuest’s 
investor base is concentrated, and from time to time in other 
financial centres. Meetings are also held at EnQuest’s offices in 
London and Aberdeen, with site visits undertaken as appropriate. 
These meetings are organised directly by the Company, via 
brokers and in response to incoming investor requests; they take 
place throughout the year, other than during closed periods.
The Company notes that the European Directive MiFID II (Markets 
in Financial Instruments Directive II) took effect in the United 
Kingdom on 3 January 2018. In particular the Company notes: 
the requirement for the costs for the provision of analysts’ 
research to be separated from other broker execution services; 
and financial services industry speculation on how this may impact 
on communication between companies and investors. EnQuest is 
monitoring related developments with the objective of ensuring 
that its existing high standards of engagement with investors 
are maintained.
2017 Annual Report
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report 
and Accounts and consider that, taken as a whole, the Annual 
Report and Accounts are fair, balanced and understandable 
and provide the necessary information for shareholders to 
assess the Company’s position and performance, business 
model and strategy.
Annual General Meeting
The Company’s AGM is attended by the Board and senior 
management and is open to all EnQuest shareholders to attend. 
It provides the Board with an important opportunity to meet with 
shareholders. All of the Directors are expected to attend and will

EnQuest PLC  Annual Report 2017
Audit Committee Report
Dear Fellow Shareholder
2017 has continued to be an active period for the Audit 
Committee. With the challenging external environment and 
the Group’s acquisition of interests in, and operatorship 
of, the Magnus oil field (‘Magnus’) and Sullom Voe Oil 
Terminal (‘SVT’), the Committee focused on the robustness 
of EnQuest’s control environment, the Group’s financial 
performance and cyber security. The Committee also 
reviewed the impact of new accounting standards, the quality 
of strategic reporting, further development of financial 
statement disclosures and the potential impacts of Brexit on 
the organisation in line with the Financial Reporting Council’s 
(‘FRC’) guidance. With respect to the UK referendum result 
leading to Brexit, we do not expect it to have a material 
impact on the Group’s performance, other than the effects 
of currency fluctuations impacting our UK Sterling cost base 
whilst our Dollar-based revenues remain unaffected. 
As planned when we last reported to you, our work in 2017 has 
focused on the areas listed below:
• Continuing to monitor closely the Group’s financial position, 
liquidity and covenant compliance given the ongoing 
uncertainty in the oil price;
• Overseeing the execution of our risk-based internal audit plan;
• The accounting implications of Kraken moving from being  
a development to a producing asset; and
• The continuous development of the Group’s internal control 
and Risk Management Framework.
This report explains the way in which the Committee addressed 
the financial and audit risks which the macro environment, 
the industry and our operations presented for the Company 
during 2017. We have taken such items into account in the 
review of the going concern and the viability assessment.
Through internal audit, we reviewed the financial control 
environment of the Group to ensure that appropriate controls 
are in place and operating effectively. Further, we ensured that 
key judgements and estimates made in the financial statements, 
such as the recoverable value of the Group’s assets, are carefully 
assessed. The Committee believes the adoption of the new 
accounting standards IFRS 9–Financial Instruments and 
IFRS 15–Revenue from Contracts with Customers, effective from 
1 January 2018, will not have a material impact on the Group’s 
financial statements during 2018. The Committee is pleased 
to report that initial work is underway in preparation for the 
potential implementation of IFRS 16–Leases, which is effective 
We will remain focused on continuing to monitor closely 
the Group’s financial position, liquidity and covenant 
compliance as well as overseeing the execution of our 
risk-based internal audit plan.
from 1 January 2019. Details of the judgements and estimates 
made in the 2017 financial statements, and how we satisfied 
ourselves as to their appropriateness, are set out in detail on 
the following pages, together with further information on how 
the Committee discharged its responsibilities during the year.
As explained further on the Company’s website  
(www.enquest.com, under Corporate Governance), 
the Audit Committee’s core responsibilities are to:
• Review the content and integrity of the annual and interim 
financial statements and advise the Board on whether they 
are fair, balanced and understandable and provide the 
necessary information for shareholders to assess the 
Company’s performance, business model and strategy;
• Review the appropriateness of the significant accounting 
policies, judgements and estimates;
• Monitor and review the effectiveness of the internal control 
and risk management systems;
• Monitor and review the effectiveness of the internal audit 
function;
• Oversee the relationship with the external auditor, including 
fees for audit and non-audit services;
• Identify any matters in respect of which it considers that 
action or improvement is needed and making 
recommendations to the Board as to the steps to be taken; 
and
• Monitor and review the process of the assessment of the 
Group’s proven and probable reserves by a recognised 
Competent Person.
The report also looks ahead to those matters which I expect 
that the Committee will need to consider in the forthcoming 
year. As in previous years, we will remain focused on monitoring 
closely the enlarged Group’s financial position, liquidity and 
covenant compliance, as well as overseeing the execution of 
our risk-based internal audit plan. Time will also be committed 
to ensuring the consolidation of the Group’s acquired interests 
in Magnus and SVT into the Group’s internal control and risk 
management systems and our approach to internal audit.

• Revisions to regulatory requirements, including the Code, are communicated and monitored;
• A thorough process of review, evaluation and verification of the content of the Annual Report and Accounts is undertaken to ensure 
accuracy and consistency;
• External advisers, including the external auditors, provide advice to management and the Audit Committee on best practice with 
regard to the creation of the Annual Report and Accounts; and
• A meeting of the Audit Committee was held in March 2018 to review and approve the draft 2017 Annual Report and Accounts in 
advance of the final sign-off by the board. EnQuest PLC  Annual Report 2017

Audit Committee Report CONTINUED
Financial reporting and significant financial statement reporting issues
The primary role of the Committee in relation to financial reporting is to assess, amongst other things:
• The appropriateness of the accounting policies selected and disclosures made, including whether they comply with International 
Financial Reporting Standards; and
• Those judgements, estimates and key assumptions that could have a significant impact on the Group’s financial performance and 
position, or on the remuneration of senior management.
We consider these items together with both management and our external auditors, who each provide reports to the Audit Committee 
in respect of these areas at each Committee meeting. The main areas considered during 2017 are set out below:
Significant financial statement reporting issue Consideration
Going concern and viability
The Group’s assessments of the going concern assumption and 
viability are based on detailed cash flow and covenant forecasts. 
These are, in turn, underpinned by forecasts and assumptions in 
respect of:
• Production forecast for the next three years, based on the 
Group’s 2018 business plan production forecast;
• The oil price assumption, based on a forward curve as at 
31 January 2018, of $67/bbl (2018), $63/bbl (2019), $60/bbl 
(2020) and $58/bbl (Q1 2021);
• Opex and capex forecasts based on the approved 2018 
business plan; and
• Other funding activities including certain asset portfolio 
activities.
The Board regularly reviews the liquidity projections of the Group. 
The detailed going concern and longer-term viability analysis, 
including sensitivity analysis and stress testing, along with 
explanations and justifications for the key assumptions made, were 
presented at the March Audit Committee meeting. The external 
auditors presented their findings on the conclusions drawn.
This analysis was considered and challenged, in detail, by the 
Committee, including the appropriateness of the assumptions 
made. The wording in the Annual Report concerning the viability 
statement and going concern assumption (see pages 35 and 36) was 
reviewed and approved for recommendation to the Board.
Potential misstatement of oil and gas reserves
The Group has total proved and probable reserves at 
31 December 2017 of 210 MMboe. The estimation of these 
reserves is essential to:
• The value of the Company;
• The value of the acquisition of interests in the Magnus oil field;
• Assessment of going concern;
• Impairment testing;
• Decommissioning liability estimates; and
• Calculation of depreciation.
At the March meeting, management presented the Group’s 2P 
reserves, together with the report from Gaffney, Cline & Associates, 
our reserves auditor.
We considered the scope and adequacy of the work performed by 
Gaffney Cline and their independence and objectivity.
Impairment of tangible and intangible assets
Significant capital expenditure is incurred on projects and the  
fair value of these projects is a significant area of judgement.  
At 31 December 2017, a total of $3.9 billion had been capitalised 
in respect of oil and gas and other fixed assets, and $0.2 billion in 
respect of goodwill. The recovery of these amounts is dependent 
upon the expected future cash flows from the underlying assets. 
Owing primarily to changes in assumptions and lower production 
performance at Alma/Galia compared to the same time last year, 
impairment testing has been performed resulting in a pre-tax 
non-cash net impairment charge of $0.2 billion of tangible oil and 
gas assets. Included within this number are further impairments of 
$0.3 billion and impairment reversals of $0.1 billion.
These impairment tests are underpinned by assumptions 
regarding:
• 2P reserves;
• Oil price assumptions (forward curve until 2021 and $70/bbl 
real thereafter);
• Life of field opex and capex; and
• A discount rate driven by EnQuest’s weighted average cost of 
capital.
Management presented to the Committee, at the March meeting, 
the key assumptions made in respect of impairment testing, and the 
result thereof. The Committee considered and challenged these 
assumptions. Consideration was also given to EY’s view of the work 
performed by management. EnQuest PLC  Annual Report 2017

STATEMENTS
Significant financial statement reporting issue Consideration
Complexity of acquisition accounting
The acquisition of 25% of the Magnus oil field from BP along with 
BP’s interest in the related infrastructure assets completed on 
1 December 2017. This is a complex agreement funded by way 
of a vendor loan from BP and is linked to a further agreement in 
relation to the funding of the decommissioning of the Thistle field. 
Given the complexity of the deal there is a risk that the fair value 
calculation could be incomplete.
At the December meeting, the preliminary acquisition financial 
statements were presented to the Committee. In the March 
meeting, the key assumptions and results of the interim completion 
statements were presented to the Committee. Consideration was 
also given to EY’s view of the work performed by management.
Adequacy of the decommissioning provision
The Group’s decommissioning provision of $0.6 billion at 
31 December 2017 is based upon a discounted estimate of the 
future costs and timing of decommissioning the Group’s oil and 
gas assets. Judgement exists in respect of the estimation of the 
costs involved, the discount rate assumed, and the timing of 
decommissioning activities.
During 2016, the Group commissioned Wood Group PSN to 
estimate the costs involved in decommissioning each of our 
operated fields, excluding Kraken. In 2017, the Group 
commissioned Wood Group PSN to estimate the decommissioning 
cost estimates for the Kraken facility and associated infrastructure. 
These estimates were reviewed by operations personnel and 
adjustments were made where necessary to reflect management’s 
view of the estimates. The estimates in respect of decommissioning 
the Group’s well stock was determined internally by appropriately 
qualified personnel.
The estimate for PM8/Seligi is reviewed triennially, with the next 
review scheduled for 2018.
For Alba, our non-operated asset, the provision is based on 
estimates provided by the operator, adjusted as necessary by 
our own operations personnel, to ensure consistency in key 
assumptions with our other North Sea assets.
The Committee reviewed the report by management summarising 
the key findings and their impact on the provision. Regard was also 
given to the observations made by EY as to the appropriateness of 
the estimates made.
Taxation
At 31 December 2017, the Group carried deferred tax balances 
comprising $398.3 million of tax assets (primarily related to tax 
losses) and $62.7 million of tax liabilities.
The recoverability of the tax losses has been assessed by 
reference to the tax projections derived from the Group’s 
impairment testing. Ring fence losses totalling $3,121 million 
($1,248 million tax-effected) have been recognised. Mainstream 
(outside ring fence) tax losses totalling $290.2 million ($49.3 million 
tax-effected) have not been recognised due to uncertainty of 
recovery.
Given the complexity of tax legislation, risk exists in respect of 
some of the Group’s tax positions.
The Committee received a report from the Group’s Head of Tax, 
outlining all uncertain tax positions, and evaluated the technical 
arguments supporting the position taken by management. The 
Committee also took into account the views of EY as to the 
adequacy of our tax balances.
An evaluation of the transparency of the Group’s tax exposures 
was undertaken, reviewing the adequacy and appropriateness of 
tax disclosures presented by management. Regard was also given 
to the observations made by EY as to the appropriateness of the 
disclosures made. 64
EnQuest PLC  Annual Report 2017
Audit Committee Report CONTINUED
Internal controls
The Code requires that the Board monitors the Company’s 
risk management and internal control systems and, at 
least annually, carries out and reports on the results of a 
review of their effectiveness. The Board has oversight of 
risk management within EnQuest, and page 40 provides 
more detail on how the Board, and its Risk Committee, 
have discharged its responsibility in this regard.
Responsibility in respect of internal control is delegated 
to the Audit Committee. Key features of the Group’s 
internal control framework, the effectiveness of which is 
reviewed continually throughout the year, include:
• Clear delegations of authority to the Board and its 
sub-committees, and to each level of management;
• Setting of HSE&A, operational and financial targets and 
budgets which are subsequently monitored by management 
and the Board;
• A comprehensive risk management process with clear 
definition of risk tolerance and appetite. This includes a review 
by the Risk Committee of the effectiveness of management 
controls and actions which address and mitigate the most 
significant risks;
• An annual risk-based internal audit programme developed in 
conjunction with management. Findings are communicated to 
the Audit Committee and follow-up reviews are conducted 
where necessary; and
• Further objective feedback provided by the external auditors 
and other external specialists.
Obtaining assurance on the internal control environment
Since the flotation in 2010, the Group has outsourced its 
internal audit function and, following a re-tender process 
in 2013, PwC were appointed to act as the Company’s 
internal auditors. The Committee remains satisfied that 
outsourcing this function, rather than building an in-house 
team, remains the most appropriate approach for a company 
of this size. We will continue to keep this under review.
The Group’s system of internal control, which is embedded in 
all key operations, provides reasonable rather than absolute 
assurance that the Group’s business objectives will be achieved 
within the risk tolerance levels defined by the Board. Regular 
management reporting, which provides a balanced assessment of 
key risks and controls, is an important component of assurance.
In respect of the work performed by the internal auditors, we 
determine the internal audit plan each year. When setting the plan 
we consider recommendations from management, the internal 
auditors, and take into account the particular risks impacting the 
Company, which are reviewed by the Board and Risk Committee. 
During 2017, internal audit undertook various projects, including 
reviews of:
• The financial controls and processes for the transition from 
project to operation for Kraken;
• The Group’s cyber security environment;
• The Group’s compliance with the renegotiated revolving credit 
facility; and
• Ongoing rotational reviews of the financial control framework 
of:
 – Controls in the North Sea and head office finance functions; 
and
 – Joint venture accounting.
In all cases the audit conclusions were that the systems 
and processes were satisfactory or, where potential control 
enhancements were identified as being required, the 
Committee ensured that appropriate action was being taken 
by management to implement the agreed improvements. 
Cyber security is one of the Group’s key focus areas and work 
on assessing the cyber security environment and implementing 
improvements as necessary will be continuing during 2018.
After considering the priorities in 2018, we have directed 
internal audit to focus on, among other areas, readiness for 
increased offshoring of some finance related operations 
to Dubai, compliance with procurement procedures, cyber 
security, and an ongoing rotational review of the financial 
control framework including the impact of the recently acquired 
Magnus and SVT assets, of which EnQuest is now the operator.
External audit
One of the Committee’s key responsibilities is to monitor the 
performance, objectivity and independence of EY, who have been 
the Group’s external auditor since 2010. Each year the Committee 
ensures that the scope of the auditors’ work is sufficient and 
that the auditors are remunerated fairly. The process for 
reviewing EY’s performance involves interviewing, each year, key 
members of the Group who are involved in the audit process 
to obtain feedback on the quality, efficiency and effectiveness 
of EY’s audit services. Additionally, the Committee members 
take into account their own view of EY’s performance when 
determining whether or not to recommend their reappointment.
The effectiveness of EY was formally evaluated during the 
Committee’s meeting in August 2017, and it was concluded 
that the Committee continues to be satisfied with EY’s 
performance and the firm’s objectivity and independence. 
The Chairman of the Committee met with the extended 
audit team to discuss key audit issues during the year.
In its evaluation of EY, the Committee also considered the 
level of non-audit services provided by the firm during 
the year, the compliance with our policy in respect of the 
provision of non-audit services by the external auditor, and the 
safeguards in place to ensure EY’s continued independence 
and objectivity. In recommending the reappointment of EY 
for 2017, the Committee recognised the decrease in the size 
of non-audit fees (from $370,000 in 2016 to $5,000 in 2017). 
In 2016, the fees reflected the work required of EY for the 
Group’s equity raise prospectus, including their working capital 
review and reporting accountant’s services. These services 
provided in 2016 are typically provided by a company’s auditor 
to achieve shareholder value. The ratio of non-audit fees to 
audit fees over the last three years was 16%, which remains 
below the 70% cap outlined in the Company’s policy in respect 
of non-audit services provided by the external auditor.
In respect of audit tendering and rotation, the Committee has 
adopted a policy which complies with the EU Audit Regulation 
and Competition and Markets Authority ‘The Statutory Audit 
Services for Large Companies Market Investigation (Mandatory 
Use of Competitive Tender Processes and Audit Committee 
Responsibilities)’ Order 2014. This policy requires an annual 
assessment of whether an audit tender is required on the basis of 
quality or independence, a mandatory tender after ten years, and 
rotation of audit firms at least every 20 years. As noted above, EY 
has been the Group’s auditor since 2010, and the external audit 
has not been tendered in this time. Following the results of our 
annual evaluation of EY, a decision was taken not to tender the 
2018 audit. While no tender is required until 2019, the Committee 
will continue to evaluate the appropriate time to conduct a tender. 65

Use of external auditors for non-audit services
The Audit Committee and Board believe that the external 
auditor’s independence and objectivity can potentially 
be affected by the level of non-audit services to EnQuest. 
However, the Committee acknowledges that certain work of 
a non-audit nature is best undertaken by the external auditor. 
To ensure objectivity and independence, and to reflect best 
practice in this area, the Company’s policy on non-audit 
services reflects the EU Regulations. As a consequence of 
this, the Committee took the decision to discontinue using EY 
for tax services, other than in exceptional circumstances.
As part of the Committee’s process in respect of the provision of 
non-audit services, the external auditor provides the Committee 
with information about their policies and processes for 
maintaining independence and monitoring compliance with 
current regulatory requirements, including those regarding the 
rotation of audit partners and staff. EY have reconfirmed their 
independence and objectivity.
The key features of the non-audit services policy, the full 
version of which is available on our website, are as follows:
• A pre-defined list of prohibited services has been established;
• A schedule of services where the Group may engage the 
external auditor has been established and agreed by the 
Committee;
• Any non-audit project work which could impair the objectivity 
or independence of the external auditor may not be awarded 
to the external auditor; and
• Fees for permissible non-audit services provided by the 
external auditor for three consecutive years are to be capped 
at no more than 70% of the average Group audit fee for the 
preceding three years.
Delegated authority by the Audit Committee for the approval 
of non-audit services by the external auditor is as follows:
Authoriser
Value of services per  
non-audit project
Chief Financial Officer Up to £50,000
Chairman of the Audit Committee Up to £100,000
Audit Committee Above £100,000
Raising concerns at work
Throughout the year, our whistleblowing procedure, the 
‘speak-up’ reporting line, has continued to be in place across 
the Group. This allows employees and contractors to raise 
any concerns about business practices in confidence through 
an independently appointed third party. Any concerns raised 
under these arrangements or otherwise are investigated 
promptly by the General Counsel and notified to the Chairman 
of the Audit Committee, with follow-up action being taken 
as soon as practicable thereafter. In line with the process 
outlined on page 59 of the Corporate Governance Statement, 
there have been a limited number of instances where such 
issues have been elevated and the Committee has been 
kept appraised of how these have been addressed. 66
EnQuest PLC  Annual Report 2017
Directors’ Remuneration Report
The Committee is clear that variable remuneration should  
be based on strong, long-term business performance that 
delivers value to shareholders.
Dear Fellow Shareholder
On behalf of the Board and my fellow members of the 
Remuneration Committee, I am pleased to present EnQuest’s 
Directors’ Remuneration Report (‘DRR’) for the financial year 
ended 31 December 2017.
Overview
At the Annual General Meeting (‘AGM’) in May 2017, over 97% of 
shareholders voted to approve the new remuneration policy for 
EnQuest. Policy revisions followed an extensive review and 
shareholder consultation by the Committee on remuneration 
framework changes to reflect both developments in EnQuest as 
a maturing business and the ongoing need to retain and attract 
high calibre people in a challenging commercial environment. 
In 2017, we implemented the first phase of the two-year 
rebalancing of the overall executive remuneration package from 
short-term bonuses to longer-term Performance Share Plan 
(‘PSP’) awards. The main updates were as follows:
• Annual bonus award percentage was reduced from 100% to 
85% of salary (at target) and from 225% to 175% of salary 
(maximum);
• Implementation of an additional debt metric into the annual 
bonus performance conditions;
• PSP maximum awards increased from 200% to 250% of salary 
at normal award level and from 300% to 350% of salary at 
exceptional award level;
• PSP awards to include a debt metric if and when required; 
• Policy of bonus deferral into shares revised so that the entire 
annual bonus award above 100% of salary is deferred into 
EnQuest shares for two years delivering a cap on the actual 
bonus paid out in cash;
• Executive Directors required to build up and hold at least 
200% of salary in shares; and
• Malus or clawback provisions initiated on 2017 cash and 
share elements of the annual bonus plan and on PSP awards. 
In 2018, the second phase will see us implement a further 
reduction in the annual bonus percentage award to 75% of 
salary (at target) and 125% of salary (maximum). 
As a Committee, we believe that the policy, strongly endorsed by 
shareholders, is aligned with the Company’s strategy and market 
best practice. We are also clear that variable remuneration  
should be based on strong, long-term business performance 
that delivers value to shareholders. We believe we have set 
threshold, target and stretch levels of performance accordingly.
2017 was a critical year for EnQuest, focused on positioning the 
Group for profitable growth and transitioning from a period of 
heavy capital investment to one in which the Group can begin 
to reduce its debt. Production performance was lower than 
originally anticipated and the Group was required to undertake 
prudent measures to manage the Group’s liquidity and debt 
positions, which it did successfully. Delivering first oil from 
Kraken, along with its improving performance through the 
second half of 2017 and into 2018, along with the completion of 
the acquisition of assets from BP, underpin the Group’s 
confidence in material production growth in 2018. The resulting 
increase in the Group’s operating cash flow combined with 
lower capital expenditure will enable the Company to start to 
reduce its debt.
As part of our routine engagement on remuneration, we consulted 
with institutional shareholders on certain matters, including: 
• Chief Financial Officer (‘CFO’) remuneration with regard to 
bringing Jonathan Swinney’s salary closer to the peer group 
median; 
• The Committee’s belief that there is a need to align how the 
Company’s production and reserves growth targets are 
described in the DRR, which has been on a ‘per share’ basis, 
with their actual assessment, disclosure and reporting over 
recent years, which has been on an absolute numbers basis; 
and 
• Introducing a two-year post-vesting holding period for any 
PSP award made to Executive Directors from 2019 onwards 
in advance of the planned revision to the UK Corporate 
Governance Code. 
While the proposed CFO remuneration increase is within the 
existing remuneration policy, shareholders are being asked to 
vote on a resolution to alter the existing Directors’ remuneration 
policy at the 2018 AGM to approve the implementation of the 
two-year post-vesting holding period for PSP awards and the 
removal of the ‘per share’ description of the Group’s production 
and reserve growth targets. As always, we strive to maintain an 
open and transparent shareholder dialogue, and appreciate 
your support and input.
The Directors’ remuneration policy set out on the following 
pages has been updated to reflect the previously approved 
reduction in the target and maximum annual bonus awards to 
be implemented for 2018 and the proposed policy changes 
outlined above.  67

STATEMENTS
The DRR this year has three sections:
1. My annual statement as Chairman of the EnQuest 
Remuneration Committee.
2. The key elements of the remuneration policy, which will be 
subject to a binding shareholder vote at the 2018 AGM. 
3. The Annual Report on Remuneration of the Executive 
Directors and Non-Executive Directors for 2017. This will be 
subject to an advisory shareholder vote at the 2018 AGM. 
Shareholder consultation
We have continued our programme of open and transparent 
shareholder dialogue in 2017. Adjusting our Executive Director 
salaries towards the median of a relevant peer group is part 
of our policy and in keeping with standard benchmarking 
practice within EnQuest. This year, following a further review 
of Executive Director remuneration, we consulted with 
shareholders about the need to move Jonathan Swinney’s salary 
as CFO closer to market median levels given his performance in 
delivering the 2016 financial restructuring, the increased focus 
on financial discipline and the prudent measures undertaken  
to manage the Group’s liquidity and debt position. 
Following this consultation and a supportive response from 
shareholders, a 9.9% increase in base salary for Jonathan Swinney 
is being recommended by the Committee, taking his annualised 
salary from £294,000 to £323,000. This increase is partially offset 
by the agreed reduction in 2018 of his target annual bonus level 
from 85% to 75% of salary and reduction in his maximum potential 
annual bonus from 175% to 125%. This moves the EnQuest CFO’s 
salary and total remuneration closer to, although still below, the 
median for CFOs of our peers, adjusted for size.
The Committee decided to delay implementation of any 
increase until March 2018 to allow time for the Committee to 
take into account the Company’s more recent operational and 
financial performance. As a result of the recent positive 
Company performance, the Committee implemented the 9.9% 
salary increase for Jonathan Swinney from 1 March 2018. 
The Committee also highlighted to our shareholders that, for a 
number of years, we had labelled our PSP performance metrics 
for production and reserves growth in the DRR as being on a ‘per 
share’ basis whereas disclosure and performance measurement 
has been made on an absolute numbers basis (i.e. in Boepd and 
MMboe). This discrepancy between the ‘per share’ terminology 
and actual target setting has not previously been identified. 
However, in light of the 2016 financial restructuring and the 
resulting increase in the number of shares in issue, the funds 
from which were not used to acquire new reserves or production, 
the Committee is seeking shareholders’ approval for an 
amendment to the revised remuneration policy that will clarify 
that targets for awards vesting from 2019 onwards will be on an 
absolute basis. The Committee has taken into account that an 
adjustment to these targets to reflect the increase in the number 
of shares resulting from EnQuest’s financial restructuring would 
impact not only Executive Directors but also the wider employee 
population. The Committee has also taken into account 
management’s longstanding and significant alignment with 
shareholders through exposure to equity. The Committee’s 
intent is to maintain absolute numbers for production and 
reserves growth targets as they are actually reported now for 
outstanding 2016 and 2017 PSP cycles. However, should the 
Company engage in any future transaction where a change in 
equity capital is directly linked to changes in production and/or 
reserves, the Committee will make appropriate adjustments to 
such production and reserves growth targets. Any such 
adjustments would be designed to neutralise fully the incentive 
outcome to the impact of the change in equity capital.
In advance of the revisions to the Corporate Governance Code 
expected later in 2018, the revised remuneration policy will also 
introduce a two-year holding period for any PSP award made to 
Executive Directors from 2019 onwards.
The resolution putting forward two amendments to the 
remuneration policy is being presented to shareholders for a 
binding vote at the Company’s AGM on 24 May 2018 and, if 
approved, will take effect from this date. It is anticipated that 
this revised policy will remain in force for the following 
three-year period, with a shareholder vote next being required 
in 2021.
Performance and remuneration outcomes for 2017
2017 was another year of strong safety performance and 
witnessed the achievement of a number of strategic milestones. 
The Kraken development was brought onstream in the second 
quarter as planned and achieved gross production rates of 
40,000 Bopd in November. EnQuest also completed its 
acquisition of additional interests in, and operatorship of, 
Magnus and SVT and delivered on its operating cost and capital 
expenditure targets. However, production performance was 
impacted by a slower than planned increase in production  
from Kraken and lower than planned production from the 
Scolty/Crathes and Alma/Galia assets in the Central North Sea, 
which in turn impacted cash flow, liquidity and net debt.
2017 annual bonus – payable in 2018
The Executive Directors’ annual bonus awards are based on  
a combination of financial and operational results and the 
achievement of key accountability objectives. The bonus 
attainment for Amjad Bseisu (Chief Executive) was based solely 
on achievement against the Company Performance Contract.  
In the case of Jonathan Swinney and Neil McCulloch (Chief 
Operating Officer), 50% of their bonus award was based on 
Company performance and 50% on achievement against 
performance measures set out in their individual performance 
contracts. The 2017 target and maximum bonus potential for 
Executive Directors was reduced to 85% and 175% of salary, 
respectively, as part of the approved phased remuneration 
policy changes. A 2017 bonus award of 99.4% of base salary 
(56.8% of maximum) has been made for Amjad Bseisu and 
131.9% of base salary (75.4% of maximum) for Jonathan Swinney. 
The bonus amount shown for Neil McCulloch, equivalent to 
46.2% of base salary (26.4% of maximum), is the pro-rated bonus 
disclosure to reflect the period he was an Executive Director 
(25 May 2017 to 10 December 2017 inclusive). The Committee 
believes that these levels of award are appropriate in light of 
performance during the year, including but not limited to the 
operational delivery at Kraken, the completion of the Magnus 
and SVT acquisition, which involved the safe and effective 
integration of more than 300 employees transferred from BP 
to EnQuest, along with the continued management of the 
Company’s cost targets and liquidity position. Full details of 
how these awards were determined are included on pages 76 to 
79 of this report. For Jonathan Swinney, the bonus amount in 
excess of 100% of salary will be deferred into EnQuest shares 
with a holding period of two years in line with the policy
Performance Share Plan (‘PSP’)
The award vesting on 27 March 2018 was the 2015 PSP award, 
which had a three-year performance period ending 
31 December 2017 and vested at 10.92% of the original award. 
Our production and reserves growth targets were missed but 
our Total Shareholder Return (‘TSR’) position against the 
comparator group was above the median and, at 30% 
weighting, vested at 10.92%. Full details of actual performance 
against the three performance conditions of TSR, production 
growth and reserves growth targets are included in the report. 
In 2017, the PSP award levels were increased to 250% of salary at 
normal level and 350% of salary at exceptional level as part of 
the rebalancing provisions of the executive remuneration 
package. A PSP award of 250% of salary for both the Chief 
Executive (CE) and CFO was made on 12 September 2017 
following the 2017 AGM shareholder vote. The performance 
conditions will be measured over the three-year performance 
period until 31 December 2019, but will only vest in September 
2020. The target descriptor of ‘per share’ has been removed  EnQuest PLC  Annual Report 2017

Governance
General governance
The Directors’ Remuneration Report has been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 and Schedule 8 
of the Large and Medium-sized Companies and Groups (Accounts and Reports) Regulations 2008 as amended in August 2013. It also 
describes the Group’s compliance with the Corporate Governance Code (the ‘Code’) in relation to remuneration. The Committee has 
taken account of the new requirements for the disclosure of Directors’ remuneration and guidelines issued by major shareholder bodies 
when setting the remuneration strategy for the Company.
Remuneration policy
This section sets out the principles behind our remuneration policy and the policy’s key elements for both the Executive and  
Non-Executive Directors that were approved by shareholders at our AGM on 25 May 2017, along with the two policy changes  
as set out in the resolution being put to a shareholder vote at the 2018 AGM.
Remuneration principles
In determining the remuneration policy approved at the AGM held in May 2017, we reviewed our overall remuneration principles to 
ensure that they continued to be aligned with our strategy. EnQuest’s strategic objective is to be the operator of choice for maturing 
and underdeveloped hydrocarbon assets, using its differential capabilities to enhance hydrocarbon recovery and extend the useful lives 
of these assets in a profitable and responsible manner.
We also want to ensure that we operate within the appropriate culture and, therefore, that the principles support and reinforce the 
EnQuest values. Our principles are clear and simple, to strengthen the link of reward for exceptional performance, as well as to 
emphasise the importance of our values.
In summary, the principles underpinning our remuneration policy are that remuneration for Executive Directors should be:
• Aligned with shareholders;
• Fair, reflective of best practice, and market competitive;
• Comprising fixed pay set at or below the median and variable pay capable of delivering remuneration at upper quartile; and
• Rewarding performance with a balance of short-term and long-term elements, shifting the emphasis to longer-term reward.
Executive Directors
General approach
The remuneration of the Executive Directors comprises base salary, participation in an annual bonus plan (paid partly in cash and partly 
in deferred shares), the Performance Share Plan (‘PSP’), private medical insurance, life assurance, personal accident insurance, and cash 
in lieu of pension.
When setting remuneration for the Executive Directors, the Committee takes into account the performance and experience of the 
Director, as well as the Company performance, employment conditions for other employees in the Company, and the external 
marketplace. Data is obtained from a variety of independent sources.
The following table details EnQuest’s remuneration policy which will become binding from 24 May 2018, subject to approval at the 2018 
AGM. This is the same as the policy approved in 2017, with revisions identified in the footnotes:
from the PSP section in the policy and all relevant tables in the 
DRR to reflect the absolute numbers of production and reserves 
growth measures disclosed. In the event that the vote to 
approve the revised remuneration policy is not passed at the 
2018 AGM, the descriptor ‘per share’ will be reapplied in 
subsequent DRRs.
Executive Director shareholding
Executive Directors are now expected to build up and hold a 
shareholding of 200% of salary. Both Amjad Bseisu and 
Jonathan Swinney comfortably meet this requirement.
Executive Director changes
Neil McCulloch joined the Board as Chief Operating Officer on 
25 May 2017 at the 2017 AGM with a salary of £280,000. This was 
unchanged from his salary rate implemented from 1 January 
2017. Neil stepped down from the Board on 11 December 2017. 
Details of his termination payments are set out in the Payments 
for Loss of Office section in the Report. All such payments made 
to Neil are in line with the approved policy. 
Executive Director remuneration in 2018
2018 base salaries
As outlined in our report last year, we plan to adjust salaries 
progressively towards the median of peer companies in our 
market over the period of this new policy and subject to 
continued strong performance. This is designed to ensure we 
continue to retain and attract top people who can deliver 
superior results for our stakeholders.
For the year ahead, the Committee has awarded a salary 
increase of 2.0% to Amjad Bseisu, effective from 1 January 2018. 
Following the shareholder consultation outlined above, 
Jonathan Swinney’s salary has increased by 9.9% with effect 
from 1 March 2018.
2018 PSP awards
The Committee has decided to grant 250% of salary as a PSP 
award in April 2018 to Amjad Bseisu and Jonathan Swinney. 
These 2018 awards will be subject to the same scope of 
performance metrics as for the 2017 award, including net debt.
In 2017, we again saw the clear benefits of transparency and a 
positive and close working relationship with major shareholders. 
We wish this to continue as we welcome your input, and are 
always prepared to listen and take on board suggestions that 
help EnQuest to continue to mature and develop. 
The Committee and I wish to thank all our shareholders for their 
ongoing support over the years. I hope you will all support the 
resolution to vote for this Directors’ Remuneration Report at the 
forthcoming AGM.

Directors’ Remuneration Report CONTINUED
Performance measures and targets
Annual bonus
The annual bonus scheme is a weighted scorecard of key performance indicators with a number of categories, under which the 
performance of the Company, and therefore the annual bonus of Executive Directors, is determined. The categories that form the 
scorecard may include, but are not limited to:
• Health, Safety, Environment and Assurance (‘HSE&A’);
• Financial (including EBITDA, opex and capex);
• Operational performance/production;
• Project delivery;
• Reserves additions;
• Net debt; and
• Objectives linked to key accountabilities.
The measures in each category are selected by the Committee to support the creation of shareholder value. These criteria are also 
aligned with the longer-term strategy of the Company and the performance conditions of the Company’s long-term incentive scheme. 
In addition to measuring performance against objectives, the Committee will consider the overall quality of the Company’s financial 
performance, and other factors, when determining annual performance pay awards.
Amjad Bseisu’s bonus objectives are normally based solely on the Company Performance Contract of EnQuest. Jonathan Swinney’s 
bonus objectives may also include up to 50% based on additional objectives that cover his own specific area of key accountabilities and 
responsibilities.
Annual bonus and share deferrals
Executive Directors will normally receive any applicable annual bonus in cash and deferred shares. Any amount up to the equivalent of 
100% of salary will be distributed in cash around the time of the announcement of full year results, with any amount above the equivalent 
of 100% of salary converted into EnQuest shares (without further performance conditions) and deferred for two years, subject to 
continued employment. In exceptional circumstances, these awards may be settled in cash, but only with the pre-approval of the 
Remuneration Committee.
Performance Share Plan
The PSP is typically awarded annually and has a vesting period of three years. Performance conditions are attached to the awards and 
reflect the longer term strategy of EnQuest. For awards granted in 2018 these will comprise:
• TSR against a comparator group of oil and gas companies;
• Production growth on a Compound Annual Growth (‘CAG’) basis;
• Reserves growth on a relative growth basis; and
• Net debt on a relative reduction basis if considered appropriate by the Remuneration Committee.
Approach to recruitment remuneration
In the event that the Company appoints a new Executive Director either internally or externally, when determining appropriate 
remuneration arrangements, the Committee will take into consideration a number of factors including, but not limited to: quantum 
relating to prior arrangements; the remuneration of other Executive Directors in the Company; appropriate benchmarks in the industry; 
and the financial condition of the Company. This ensures that the arrangements are in the best interests of both the Company and its 
shareholders without paying more than is necessary to recruit an executive of the required calibre.
Salaries for new hires (including internal promotions) will be set to reflect their skills and experience, the Company’s intended pay 
positioning and the market rate for the role. If it is considered appropriate to appoint a new Director on a below market salary initially 
(for example, to allow them to gain experience in the role) their salary may be increased to a median market level over a period by way of 
increases above the general rate of wage growth in the Group and inflation.
The remuneration package for a new Executive Director would be set in accordance with the terms of the Company’s approved 
remuneration policy at the time. Different performance measures may be set for the year of joining the Board for the annual bonus and 
PSP, taking into account the individual’s role and responsibilities and the point in the year the executive joined.
Benefits and pensions for new appointees to the Board will normally be provided in line with those offered to other executives and 
employees taking account of local market practice, with relocation expenses/arrangements provided for if necessary. Tax equalisation 
may also be considered if an executive is adversely affected by taxation due to their employment with EnQuest. Legal fees and other 
relevant costs and expenses incurred by the individual may also be paid by the Company.
In the case of an internal hire, any outstanding variable pay awarded in relation to the previous role will be allowed to pay out according 
to its terms of grant.
The Committee may make additional awards on appointing an Executive Director to ‘buy-out’ remuneration arrangements forfeited on 
leaving a previous employer. Any such payments would be based solely on remuneration lost when leaving the former employer and 
would reflect (as far as practicable) the delivery mechanism, time horizons and performance requirement attaching to that remuneration. 
The Group’s existing incentive arrangements, including the 2010 Restricted Share Plan (‘RSP’), will be used to the extent possible for any 
buyout (subject to the relevant plan limits), although awards may also be granted outside of these schemes, if necessary, and as 
permitted under the Listing Rules.
On the appointment of a new Chairman or Non-Executive Director, the fees will be set taking into account the experience and calibre of 
the individual. EnQuest PLC  Annual Report 2017

4 Laurie Fitch was appointed to the Board on 8 January 2018, becoming a member of the Remuneration and Risk Committees.
External directorships
The Company recognises that its Executive Directors may be invited to become Non-Executive Directors of companies outside the 
Company and exposure to such non-executive duties can broaden experience and knowledge, which would be of benefit to the 
Company. Any external appointments are subject to Board approval (which would not be given if the proposed appointment required a 
significant time commitment; was with a competing company; would lead to a material conflict of interest; or could otherwise have a 
detrimental effect on a Director’s performance). Executive Directors will be permitted to retain any fees arising from such appointments, 
details of which will be provided in the respective companies’ Annual Report on Remuneration. 
Policy on payment for loss of office
The Company’s policy is for all Executive Directors to have contracts of service which can be terminated by either the Director 
concerned or the Company on giving 12 months’ notice of termination. In the event of termination by the Company (other than as a 
result of a change of control), the Executive Directors would be entitled to compensation for loss of basic salary and cash benefit 
allowance and insured benefits for the notice period up to a maximum period of 12 months. Such payments may be made monthly and 
would be subject to mitigation. The Company may also enable the provision of outplacement services to a departing Executive Director, 
where appropriate.
When Executive Directors leave the Company with good leaver status, and they have an entitlement to unvested shares granted under 
the Deferred Bonus Share Plan (‘DBSP’) and PSP, any performance conditions associated with each award outstanding would remain in 
place and are normally tested at the end of the original performance period. Shares would also normally then vest on their original 
vesting date in the proportion to the satisfied performance conditions and are normally pro-rated for time. Awards held by Executive 
Directors who are not good leavers would lapse.
An annual bonus would not typically be paid to Executive Directors when leaving the Company. However, in good leaver circumstances 
the Committee has the discretion to pay a pro-rated bonus in cash, in consideration for performance targets achieved in the year. 
Deferred bonus shares held by good leavers will normally vest at the normal vesting date.
Similar provisions related to the treatment of incentive awards would apply on a change of control, with performance conditions 
normally tested at the date of the change of control and with pro-rating for time, although the Remuneration Committee has discretion 
to waive pro-rating (but not the performance conditions) where it feels this is in the best interests of shareholders.
The Non-Executive Directors do not have service contracts but their terms are set out in a letter of appointment. Their terms of 
appointment may be terminated by either party giving three months’ notice in writing. During the notice period Non-Executive 
Directors will continue to receive their normal fee.
Remuneration Committee discretion and determinations
The Committee will operate the annual bonus scheme, DBSP, PSP, RSP and Sharesave Scheme according to their respective rules and in 
accordance with the Listing Rules and HMRC requirements, where relevant. The Committee, consistent with market practice, retains 
discretion over a number of areas relating to the operation and administration of these arrangements. These include, but are not limited 
to, the following: EnQuest PLC  Annual Report 2017
74
Directors’ Remuneration Report CONTINUED
• Who participates in the plans;
• The timing of grant of award and/or payment;
• The size of an award and/or payment;
• Discretion relating to the measurement of performance in the event of a change of control or reconstruction;
• Applying ’good leaver’ status in circumstances such as death, ill health and other categories as the Committee determines 
appropriate and in accordance with the rules of the relevant plan;
• Discretion to disapply time pro-rating in the event of a change of control or good leaver circumstances;
• Discretion to settle any outstanding share awards in cash in exceptional circumstances;
• Adjustments or variations required in certain circumstances (e.g. rights issues, corporate restructuring, change of control, special 
dividends and other major corporate events); and
• The ability to adjust existing performance conditions and performance targets for exceptional events so that they can still fulfil their 
original purpose.
If an event occurs which results in any applicable performance conditions and/or targets being deemed no longer appropriate  
(e.g. a material acquisition or divestment), the Committee will have the ability to adjust appropriately the measures and/or targets 
and alter weightings, provided that the revised conditions or targets are not materially less difficult to satisfy.
If tax liabilities arise from an error or omission by the Company that is outside of the control of the Executive Directors, the Committee 
will have the ability to reimburse any such tax liabilities.
Legacy awards
For the avoidance of doubt, authority is given to the Committee to honour any commitments entered into with current or former 
Directors (such as the payment of a pension or the unwind of legacy share schemes) that have been disclosed to shareholders in this 
or any previous DRRs or subsequently agreed in line with the approved policy in force at that time. Details of any payments to former 
Directors will be set out in the Annual Report on Remuneration as they arise.
Remuneration outcomes in different performance scenarios

Statement of consideration of employment conditions elsewhere in the Company
The remuneration arrangements for the Executive Directors are consistent with the remuneration principles that have been established 
and are similar to those of the other employees of EnQuest. EnQuest PLC  Annual Report 2017

STRATEGIC 
REPORT
CORPORATE 
GOVERNANCE
FINANCIAL 
STATEMENTS
The key differences are as follows:
• Executive Directors and members of the Executive Committee have their fixed pay set below or at market median for the industry. 
Other employees typically have their salaries positioned at market median. Specific groups of key technical employees may have their 
salaries set above median for the industry.
• All employees are offered a non-contributory pension scheme. Executive Directors are given cash in lieu of pension. Non-Executive 
Directors do not participate in pension or benefits arrangements.
• Non-Executive Directors do not participate in the annual bonus scheme.
• If applicable, Executive Directors have an element of the annual bonus automatically converted to shares and deferred.
• All other employees may be invited to participate in the DBSP where they can elect to defer a defined proportion of their annual 
bonus and receive a matching amount of shares that vest over the following three years. Executive Directors are not eligible to 
receive matching share awards under this plan.
During the annual remuneration review the Committee receives a report which details the remuneration arrangements of other 
executive and senior management as well as the overall spend versus budget for all employees. This report helps to act as a guide to the 
Committee as to the levels of reward being achieved across the organisation so that they can ensure the Directors’ pay does not fall out 
of line with the general trends.
Employees have not previously been directly consulted about the setting of Directors’ pay, although the Committee will take into 
consideration any developments in regulations in operating this policy.
Statement of shareholder views
The Remuneration Committee welcomes and values the opinions of our shareholders with regard to the levels of remuneration for 
Directors. The 2017 Directors’ Remuneration Report was voted on at the AGM held in May 2017, where 98.44% of the votes cast were  
in favour. 
In accordance with the policy statements made in the 2016 Annual Report following consultation with shareholders in early 2017,  
the second and final planned reduction within this approved policy period to both the target and maximum bonus level has been 
implemented for 2018. 
In late 2017 and early 2018, the Committee consulted with shareholders representing around 44% of the Company’s shares concerning 
the proposed increase in Jonathan Swinney’s fixed remuneration and clarifications with regard to the appropriate metrics used to 
measure the achievement, or otherwise, of PSP targets as set out in the Chairman of the Remuneration Committee’s letter to 
shareholders on pages 66 to 68. Shareholders were supportive of the proposed salary increase for Jonathan Swinney. While broad 
support was also found for amending the description of targets under the PSP, with shareholders appreciating the need to maintain 
effective incentives for Directors and the Company’s employees, the Committee felt it prudent to seek shareholders’ approval for a 
formal policy amendment in accordance with its policy of ongoing open dialogue to ensure absolute clarity going forward.

Notes:
1 Neil McCulloch was elected an Executive Director of the Company on 25 May 2017 and, hence, his single total figure of remuneration for 2016 was £nil. Neil 
McCulloch stepped down from the Board on 11 December 2017. His salary, benefits and bonus in 2017 are pro-rated to reflect his qualifying service as an 
Executive Director (25 May 2017 to 10 December 2017 inclusive).
2 The annual bonus for 2017 for Amjad Bseisu and Jonathan Swinney was based on base salary levels and payment was made in respect of the full financial year.  
The amount stated is the full amount (including any portion deferred). Any 2018 Executive Director bonus for Amjad Bseisu and Jonathan Swinney that is above 
100% of their respective salary has been paid in EnQuest PLC shares, deferred for two years, and subject to continued employment. For 2016, one third of the 
annual bonus amount was deferred into shares, in line with the remuneration policy in place at that time.
3 PSP awarded on 27 March 2015 which vested on 27 March 2018: the LTIP value shown in the 2017 single figure is calculated by taking the number of 
performance shares that have vested (10.92% of the performance conditions were achieved) multiplied by the average value of the EnQuest share price between 
1 October 2017 and 31 December 2017, as the share price on 27 March 2018 was not known at the time of this report. No LTIP value is shown for Neil McCulloch for 
2016 or 2017 as the PSP awards made in 2014 and 2015 did not vest whilst he was a member of the Board. 
PSP awarded on 22 April 2014 which vested on 22 April 2017: the LTIP value shown in the 2016 single figure is calculated by taking the number of performance 
shares that have vested (56.1% of the performance conditions were achieved) multiplied by the actual share price of 38.00 pence on the vesting date of 22 April 2017. 
The 2016 value of the vested shares in the remuneration table has been updated from last year’s value to represent the actual value received on the date of vesting. 
4 Cash in lieu of pension.

Annual bonus 2017 – paid in 2018
The Committee’s belief is that any short-term annual bonus should be tied to the overall performance of the Company. An Executive 
Director’s annual bonus may also be tied to additional objectives that cover their own specific area of key accountabilities and 
responsibilities. Under the rebalancing provisions implemented for Executive Directors for 2017, the maximum bonus entitlement for the 
year ended 31 December 2017 as a percentage of base salary was reduced from 225% to 175% for Amjad Bseisu, Jonathan Swinney and 
Neil McCulloch (for the period that Neil was on the Board in 2017). 
For Amjad Bseisu, the annual bonus for 2017 was wholly based on the Company Performance Contract results. For Jonathan Swinney 
and Neil McCulloch, 50% of their bonus potential was assessed against the Company Performance Contract and 50% on achievement 
against personal targets based on key objectives for the year in their area of responsibility. EnQuest PLC  Annual Report 2017

Summary of performance measures and targets – September 2017 PSP grant
The 2017 PSP share awards granted on 12 September 2017 have four sets of performance conditions associated with them, over a three 
year financial performance period:
• 30% of the award relates to TSR relative to a comparator group of 13 oil and gas companies over the same period;
• 30% relates to production growth on a CAG basis from a 2017 base level;
• 10% relates to reserves growth (on a relative growth basis from a 2017 base level); and
• 30% calculated on net debt reduction from a 2017 base net debt figure.
Vesting is determined on a straight-line basis between threshold and maximum for all of the performance conditions.
The performance period for the award will be 1 January 2017 to 31 December 2019 but the awards will not vest until 12 September 2020. EnQuest PLC  Annual Report 2017

Statement of implementation of the remuneration policy for the year ending 31 December 2018
Base salary and 2018 pay review
As stated in the annual statement to this report, the remuneration for the Executive Directors is geared towards variable pay linked to 
long-term performance targets, with base salaries currently set in relation to benchmarks for the oil and gas industry and comparable 
sized companies. In the view of the Committee it is therefore important to ensure that the base salaries of the Executive Directors are 
reviewed annually and that any increase reflects the change in scale and complexity of the role as the Company grows, as well as the 
performance of the Executive Director.
The table below shows the change to salaries for 2018:
Name Salary for 2017 Salary for 2018 % increase
Amjad Bseisu £451,500 £460,530 2.0
Jonathan Swinney £294,000 £323,000 9.9
The increase for Amjad Bseisu was implemented from 1 January 2018. The increase for Jonathan Swinney, following consultation and 
support expressed by majority shareholders, was implemented from 1 March 2018 taking into account the financial and operational 
performance of the Company at that time. 
The Company employees are, in general, receiving salary increases averaging approximately 2.0%.

The Company will continue to pay a cash benefit in lieu of pension of up to £50,000 plus private medical insurance, life assurance and 
personal accident insurance, the costs of which are determined by third party providers.
Annual bonus
For the year ended 31 December 2018, the target and maximum annual bonus opportunities will be significantly reduced from 85% to 
75% of salary at target and from 175% to 125% of salary at maximum as part of the second phase of the previously approved executive 
remuneration rebalancing as shown in the following table:

The annual bonus scheme for 2018 is structured as follows:
• Awards will be determined based on a balanced combination of financial and operational performance measures;
• Executive Directors (and other executive management) will have threshold, target and stretch performance levels attributed to key 
performance objectives;
• Amjad Bseisu’s bonus will be determined solely by the performance of the Company;
• Jonathan Swinney’s bonus will be determined 50% on the performance of the Company and 50% on performance concerning his 
direct area of responsibility;
• Each part of the bonus will represent a discrete element which will be added together to determine the performance award for the 
year; and
• Stretching targets will continue to apply to achieve maximum payout.
The 2018 metrics and weightings, which will determine the level of short-term incentive awards for the Directors, are set out on the 
following page.

Performance share awards
2018 PSP awards
After due consideration of business performance in 2017, the continued growth of EnQuest, the performance of the Executive Directors, 
as well as other factors, the Remuneration Committee decided to award grants equal to 250% of salary for Amjad Bseisu and Jonathan 
Swinney. These awards will be granted in April 2018.
Summary of 2018 PSP performance measures and targets
The PSP share awards granted in 2018 will have four performance metrics, each of which is measured over a three-year financial period:
• 30% of the award relates to TSR against a comparator group of oil and gas companies;
• 30% relates to production growth (on a CAG basis);
• 10% relates to reserves growth (on a relative growth basis); and 
• 30% relates to net debt (on a relative reduction basis).

Committee Chairman £10,000
There is no increase in fees for 2018.
Advisers to the Committee
With Aon New Bridge Street’s term of support to the Company expiring during 2017, a process was undertaken to receive presentations 
from a number of professional firms to provide remuneration adviser support to the Company. As a result of this exercise, Mercer Kepler 
were appointed as remuneration advisers to the Committee with effect from 1 August 2017. Aon New Bridge Street provided advice to 
the Remuneration Committee until the expiry of their term of support to the Company. 
The Committee satisfied itself that the advice given from both organisations was objective and independent by reviewing it against 
other companies in EnQuest’s comparator group. Both Aon New Bridge Street and Mercer Kepler are signatories to the Remuneration 
Consultants Group Code of Conduct which sets out guidelines for managing conflicts of interest. Neither Aon New Bridge Street nor 
Mercer Kepler now provide any other services to the Company. 
The fees in respect of 2017 paid to Aon New Bridge Street totalled £86,309 (excluding VAT) and to Mercer Kepler totalled  
£34,560 (excluding VAT). Both sets of fees were charged on the basis of the number of hours worked.

Main responsibilities
The main responsibilities of the Committee are to:
• Review the size, structure and composition of the Board in 
order to recommend changes to the Board and to ensure the 
orderly succession of Directors;
• Formalise succession planning and the process for new 
Director appointments;
• Identify, evaluate and recommend candidates for appointment 
as Directors taking into account the balance of knowledge, 
skills and experience required to serve the Board; and
• Keep under review the outside directorships and time 
commitments expected from the Non-Executive Directors.
The Nomination Committee’s full terms of reference can be found 
on the Company’s website, www.enquest.com, under Corporate 
Governance.
Appointment of Non-Executive Directors
We apply a formal, rigorous and transparent procedure for 
appointments of new Directors to the Board. For the appointments 
of Carl Hughes, John Winterman and Laurie Fitch we have used 
Zygos, an external consultancy services firm, which has no 
connection with the Company. The Committee thoroughly reviews 
each candidate in terms of the balance of skills, knowledge and 
level of independence they would bring to the Board and to screen 
for potential conflicts of interest. The Committee also gives careful 
consideration to other existing commitments a candidate may 
have and whether they will be able to devote the appropriate 
amount of time in order to fully meet what is expected of them. 
Once the Committee has identified a suitable candidate a 
recommendation is made to the Board for appointment.
Dear Fellow Shareholder
I am pleased to present to you the report of the work of the 
Nomination Committee during 2017.
The core work of the Nomination Committee is to ensure that 
the Board has the appropriate balance of skills, expertise and 
experience in order to support the strategy of the Company. 
We achieve this by continuously reviewing the Board 
composition and skills and ensuring that strong succession 
planning is in place. Currently, the Board consists of six 
Non-Executive Directors and two Executive Directors, who 
collectively bring a diverse mix of skills and experience to the 
Company and collaborate to provide strong leadership. 
As reported in the Nomination Committee Report last year, 
the main focus of the Committee in 2017 was to continue to 
manage the succession of the Non-Executive Directors and to 
focus on succession planning of the Executive Directors, 
senior management and also development planning for high 
potential individuals within the Company (a further update to 
these activities is provided on page 88).
The focus on succession planning has resulted in a number of 
changes to the composition of the Board and its Committees. 
As explained in my Chairman’s letter on pages 54 to 55, Philip 
Nolan and Neil McCulloch stepped down from the Board in 
July and December 2017 respectively. Carl Hughes, as 
reported in my 2016 Report, joined on 1 January 2017 while 
John Winterman joined in September 2017, bringing with him 
significant oil and gas experience in global exploration, 
business development and asset management. Laurie Fitch 
joined us in January this year, bringing with her a wealth of 
finance and industrial experience. More detail on the 
Company’s recruitment process can be found later on 
this page.
Jock Lennox
Chairman of the Nomination Committee

The core work of the Nomination Committee is to ensure 
that the Board has the appropriate balance of skills, 
expertise and experience in order to support the strategy of 
the Company. 88
EnQuest PLC  Annual Report 2017
Committee activities during the year
The Nomination Committee met six times in 2017 and its key 
activities included:
Assessment of the performance of each Board member by 
the Chairman
In December 2017, we circulated a questionnaire to Board 
members to facilitate feedback on the performance of the Board. 
In addition, I spoke with each of the Directors individually in order 
to ensure that each continued to contribute effectively and I 
remain satisfied that this is the case.
Structured Board succession planning
One of the key priorities for the Nomination Committee in 2017 
was to continue to manage the succession of the Non-Executive 
Directors in order to ensure that effective planning was being 
undertaken and, where necessary, acted upon with regard to the 
phasing of Non-Executive Director retirements. Over the past 
year the Committee has considered: the Non-Executive Director 
to Executive Director ratio; the skill sets currently represented and 
needed for the future; and the Board’s diversity.
Development and staff succession planning
An additional priority for the Nomination Committee was to focus 
on succession planning of the Executive Directors, senior 
management and development planning for high potential 
individuals within the Company. This focused on: leadership within 
the organisation; the range of technical knowledge and skills; 
development and execution of strategy; and staff development.  
In order to assist the process, senior managers have been invited to 
attend Board dinners and a breakfast was organised for high 
potential individuals to meet and engage with Board members.  
In addition, senior managers are encouraged to present at Board 
meetings when their specialist area of expertise is under discussion.
The Board and Nomination Committee remain satisfied that the 
individuals currently fulfilling key senior management positions in 
the Group have the requisite depth and breadth of skills, 
knowledge and experience to ensure that orderly succession to 
the Board and Executive Committee can take place.
Priorities for the coming year
Even without changes to the Corporate Governance Code as 
proposed by the Financial Reporting Council, in 2019 Helmut 
Langanger will no longer be considered independent. Accordingly, 
the Company will be required to replace its Senior Independent 
Director and Chairman of the Remuneration Committee. In 2018, 
the Committee will be preparing for this as well as preparing for any 
further changes which may be necessitated by the new Code.
Boardroom diversity
The Board’s policy was reviewed in March 2018 and it was agreed 
that the Board’s policy should continue to be that while we will 
work hard to ensure that we recruit from a diverse background of 
candidates, not just in relation to gender, we will continue to 
recruit the best candidate available for the job on merit and 
against objective criteria in order to achieve the most effective 
Board possible and to enable it to discharge its duties and 
responsibilities. We continue to seek to achieve the appropriate 
balance of the Board as we continue our succession planning and 
were pleased to welcome Laurie Fitch in January 2018.

female ratios compared to those reported in 2016. The Group’s 
compliance with Gender Pay legislation is disclosed on pages 37 
to 38 and on the Group’s website www.enquest.com. 
Re-election to the Board
Following a formal review of the effectiveness of the Board, the 
Nomination Committee confirms that it is satisfied with both the 
performance and the time commitment of each Director 
throughout the year. We remain confident that each of them is in a 
position to discharge their duties to the Company in the coming 
year and that together they continue to bring the necessary skills 
required to the Board. Detailed biographies for each Director, 
including their skills and external appointments, can be found on 
pages 50 to 51.
Conflicts of interest
The Board operates a policy to identify and, where appropriate, 
manage conflicts or potential conflicts of interest with the 
Company’s interests. In accordance with the Directors’ interest 
provisions in the Companies Act 2006, all the Directors are 
required to submit details to the Company Secretary of any 
situations which may give rise to a conflict, or potential conflict,  
of interest. The Board monitors and reviews potential conflicts of 
interest on a regular basis.

4 John Winterman was appointed as a Non-Executive Director on

Committee activities during the year
During 2017, the Committee undertook specific detailed reviews 
of the following key risk areas and the Group’s associated 
assurance and control processes, leading to certain refinements 
of these processes:
• Subsurface risk management and project development stage 
gates and reviews;
• Emergency response and crisis management;
• Hydrocarbon releases and spills; and 
• Cyber-security. 
Furthermore, in light of the review of the threats posed by 
cyber-security, the Committee recommended the addition of  
’IT security and resilience’ as a principal risk to EnQuest, which in 
turn ensures the risk receives the appropriate level of focus on 
mitigations given the Group’s low appetite for this risk. For further 
information, please see the Risks and Uncertainties section on 
pages 40 to 47 in this year’s Annual Report.
During the year, the Committee also initiated a process to 
streamline and further enhance the Group’s Risk Management 
Framework, keeping in view the expected growth and ongoing 
evolution of the business. This included engaging appropriate 
resources within the organisation, refreshing our view on all risk 
areas faced by the Group and reviewing the mechanisms for 
assessing the potential causes and impacts of these risks to 
identify the related preventative and containment controls which 
should be in place to provide assurance that these risks are 
appropriately identified, managed and mitigated. As part of this 
process, we progressed the adoption of a uniform method of 
recording risks and mitigations across the Group. In other matters, 
the Committee initiated an employee survey and feedback 
process with a view to assessing employee morale and identifying 
any appropriate actions to ensure that EnQuest is an attractive 
place to work.
Priorities for the coming year
During the course of 2018, the Committee intends to continue 
its focus on undertaking detailed analyses of specific risk areas.  
The Committee will pay particular attention to assessing how 
the mechanisms for the identification and evolution of the 
preventative and containment controls for those individual risk 
areas have been implemented. It also expects to enhance the 
Risk Management Framework through improved tracking and 
measurement of risk mitigation.
Dear Fellow Shareholder
I am pleased to present EnQuest’s first Risk Committee Report 
since the Committee was established as a Committee of the 
Board in 2016. The main responsibilities of the Committee are:
• To support the implementation and progression of the 
Group’s Risk Management Framework; and
• To conduct detailed reviews of key non-financial risks not 
reviewed within the Audit Committee.
The Committee’s full terms of reference can be found on the 
Company’s website, www.enquest.com, under Corporate 
Governance.
The Committee is comfortable that management is identifying, 
managing and mitigating risks in accordance with the Group’s 
risk appetite and strategic tenets, effectively supporting the 
delivery of the Group’s growth strategy.
Philip Holland
Chairman of the Risk Committee
19 March 2018
The Board and management of EnQuest continue to  
focus on refining its Risk Management Framework and 
processes for the identification, management and mitigation 
of risk in accordance with its risk appetite and the strategic 
tenets through which the Company intends to deliver its 
growth strategy. 90

Directors’ Report
Dividends
The Company has not declared or paid any dividends since 
incorporation on 29 January 2010 and does not have any current 
intentions to pay dividends in the near future. Any future payment 
of dividends is expected to depend on the earnings and financial 
condition of the Company meeting the conditions for dividend 
payments which the Company has agreed with its lenders and 
such other factors as the Board of Directors of the Company 
consider appropriate.
Directors
The Directors’ biographical details are set out on pages 50 
to 51. All the Directors will offer themselves for election or 
re-election at the AGM on 24 May 2018. All the current Directors 
served throughout the year, except for John Winterman who 
was appointed on 7 September 2017 and Laurie Fitch who 
was appointed on 8 January 2018. Both John and Laurie will 
therefore seek election by shareholders for the first time. 
As disclosed elsewhere, Philip Nolan, who served on the 
Board since 2012, and Neil McCulloch, who joined the Board 
after the 2017 AGM, stepped down as Directors in 2017.
Employee involvement
EnQuest operates a framework for employee information and 
consultation which complies with the requirements of the 
Information and Consultation of Employees Regulations 2005. 
Employees are informed about significant business issues and 
other matters of concern via regular Town Hall meetings, by using 
webcasts on EnQuest’s intranet, as well as face-to-face briefing 
meetings at business locations. Appropriate consultations take 
place with employees when business change is undertaken. In 
addition, a staff culture survey was conducted in July 2017 and 
more information on this is found on page 38. EnQuest offers 
employees the opportunity to participate directly in the success 
of the Company and employees are encouraged to invest in the 
Company through participation in a number of share schemes 
such as the Save As You Earn (‘SAYE’) Share Scheme. 64% of 
eligible staff participate in SAYE.

MCR (Operational Control) Scope
EnQuest has a number of financial interests, e.g. joint ventures 
and joint investments, as covered in this Annual Report for which 
it does not have operational control. In line with MCR and  
ISO 14064-1 guidance, only those assets where EnQuest has 
operational control greater than 50% are captured within the 
MCR reporting boundary. Where EnQuest has less than 50% 
operational control of an asset it is not included within the 
MCR reporting boundary. Hence, the MCR operational control 
boundary is different to EnQuest’s financial boundary. In line with 
MCR guidance, this is fully disclosed.
ISO-14064 Verified Scope
EnQuest has voluntarily opted to have emissions reported within 
the MCR scope verified to the internationally recognised  
ISO 14064-1 standard by a UKAS accredited verification body. 
This increases the robustness of the reported emissions and 
provides the reader with more confidence in the stated figures. 
This goes beyond the minimum requirements of the MCR 
guidance. Some data for the Group’s Malaysian assets (Seligi 
and associated land based offices), SVT and Magnus does not 
currently meet ISO 14064-1 requirements, and so is excluded 
from the reported figures. Efforts are being made to improve 
data quality with the objective of including these assets within the 
ISO 14064-1 verified scope in future years. SVT refrigerants and 
fugitives are excluded from both MCR and ISO 14064-1 verified 
scopes due to no data being available.

Change of control agreements
The Company is not party to any significant agreements which 
take effect, alter or terminate upon a change of control of the 
Company following a takeover bid, except in respect of: (a) the 
renegotiated revolving credit facility agreement, which includes 
provisions that, upon a change of control, permit each lender not 
to provide certain funding under that facility and to cancel its 
exposure to credit which may already have been advanced to the 
Company; (b) the prepayment facility agreement which includes 
provisions that, upon a change of control, permit the lender not to 
provide certain funding under that facility and to cancel its 
commitment to provide that facility and require prepayment of 
the credit which has already been advanced to the borrower 
(EnQuest Heather Limited); (c) the Company’s Euro Medium Term 
Note Programme (under which the Company has in issue Euro 
Medium Term Notes due 2022 with an aggregate nominal amount 
of £166 million, including capitalised interest, at the date of this 
report), pursuant to which if there is a change of control of the 
Company, a holder of a note has the option to require the 
Company to redeem such note at its principal amount, together 
with any accrued interest thereon; and (d) under the indenture 
governing the Company’s high yield notes due 2022, which at the 
date of this report have an aggregate nominal amount of  
$721 million, including capitalised interest, if the Company 
undergoes certain events defined as constituting a change of 
control, each holder of the high yield notes may require the 
Company to repurchase all or a portion of its notes at 101% of 
their principal amount, plus any accrued and unpaid interest.
Political donations
At the 2017 AGM a resolution was passed giving the Company 
authority to make political donations and/or incur political 
expenditure as defined in Sections 362 to 379 of the Companies 
Act 2006. Although the Company does not make and does not 
intend to make political donations or to incur political expenditure, 
the legislation is very broadly drafted and may catch such activities 
as funding seminars or functions to which politicians are invited, or 
may extend to bodies concerned with policy review, law reform 
and representation of the business community that the Company 
and its subsidiaries might wish to support.
No political donations were made in 2017 by the Company or any 
of its subsidiaries.

Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities for the 
Group Financial Statements
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report and the Group financial statements in accordance with applicable United 
Kingdom law and regulations. Company law requires the Directors to prepare Group financial statements for each financial year. Under 
that law, the Directors are required to prepare Group financial statements under International Financial Reporting Standards (‘IFRSs’) as 
adopted by the European Union.
Under Company law the Directors must not approve the Group financial statements unless they are satisfied that they give a true and fair 
view of the state of affairs of the Group and of the profit or loss of the Group for that period. In preparing the Group financial statements, 
International Accounting Standard 1 requires that the Directors:
• Properly select and apply accounting policies; 
• Present information, including accounting policies, in a manner that provides relevant, reliable, comparable and understandable 
information;
• Provide additional disclosures when compliance with the specific requirements in IFRSs is insufficient to enable users to understand 
the impact of particular transactions, other events and conditions on the Group’s financial position and financial performance; and
• Make an assessment of the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern.
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain the Group’s transactions 
and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the Group and enable them to ensure that the Group financial 
statements comply with the Companies Act 2006 and Article 4 of the IAS Regulation. They are also responsible for safeguarding the 
assets of the Group and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.
The Directors are also responsible for preparing the Strategic Report, Directors’ Report, the Directors’ Remuneration Report and the 
Corporate Governance Statement in accordance with Companies Act 2006 and applicable regulations, including the requirements of 
the Listing Rules and the Disclosure and Transparency Rules.
Fair, balanced and understandable
In accordance with the principles of the UK Corporate Governance Code, the Directors are responsible for establishing arrangements to 
evaluate whether the information presented in the Annual Report, taken as a whole, is fair, balanced and understandable and provides 
the information necessary for shareholders to assess the Group’s position and performance, business model and strategy, and making a 
statement to that effect. This statement is set out on page 61 of the Annual Report. EnQuest PLC  Annual Report and Accounts 2017

Our opinion on the financial statements
In our opinion:
• EnQuest PLC’s Group financial statements and parent company financial statements (the ‘financial statements’) give a true and fair 
view of the state of the Group’s and of the parent company’s affairs as at 31 December 2017 and of the Group’s loss for the year 
then ended;
• The Group financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union; 
• The parent company financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted 
Accounting Practice including FRS 101 ‘Reduced Disclosure Framework’; and
• The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006, and, as regards the 
Group financial statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation.

The financial reporting framework that has been applied in the preparation of the Group financial statements is applicable law and 
International Financial Reporting Standards (‘IFRSs’) as adopted by the European Union. The financial reporting framework that has been 
applied in the preparation of the parent company financial statements is applicable law and United Kingdom Accounting Standards, 
including FRS 101 ‘Reduced Disclosure Framework’ (United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice).
Basis for opinion 
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK) (‘ISAs (UK’)) and applicable law. Our 
responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements 
section of our report below. We are independent of the Group and parent company in accordance with the ethical requirements that are 
relevant to our audit of the financial statements in the UK, including the FRC’s Ethical Standard as applied to listed public interest 
entities, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements.
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.
Material uncertainty related to going concern
We draw attention to note 2 in the financial statements which indicates that, should the Base or Downside cases not be achieved, the 
Group may need to achieve farm down options, other potential asset sales or other funding options which represents a material 
uncertainty. As stated in note 2, this material uncertainty may cast significant doubt on the Group’s or the parent company’s ability to 
continue as a going concern. The financial statements do not include the adjustments that would result if the Group or parent company 
were unable to continue as a going concern. Our opinion is not modified in respect of this matter.
We describe below how the scope of our audit has responded to the risk relating to going concern:
• We audited the key assumptions used in the Directors’ assessment and cash flow model including oil prices, production profiles and 
future costs. We assessed the reasonableness of potential mitigants and the Company’s ability to action these mitigants in their 
going concern assessment, including the ability to achieve potential asset sales and other funding options. We considered whether 
management has exercised any bias in selecting their assumptions; 
• We performed our own sensitivity calculations on key assumptions to test the adequacy of the available headroom and assessed the 
reasonableness of the mitigating factors, in particular the Group’s ability and plan to dispose of certain assets to improve its 
liquidity position; 
• We compared forecast future cash flows to historical data, ensuring variations are in line with our expectations and understanding of 
the business and considered the reliability of past forecasts;
• We tested the covenant calculations to ensure they had been calculated correctly in accordance with the revolving credit 
facility agreement; 
• We agreed the available facilities and arrangements to underlying agreements and external confirmation from debt providers. We 
also tested covenant calculation forecasts performed by management; and
• We checked the disclosures made in the Annual Report and Accounts are adequate.
Key observations communicated to the Audit Committee
In our view management have undertaken a detailed analysis and considered an appropriately challenging scenario in making this 
conclusion. We have also concluded that management have made appropriate disclosures discussing the risks and assumptions. 
Based on our work on the going concern assessment prepared by management, we agree that a material uncertainty exists in respect of 
going concern and that this has been appropriately disclosed in the financial statements.  EnQuest PLC  Annual Report and Accounts 2017

Conclusions relating to principal risks, going concern and viability statement
We have nothing to report in respect of the following information in the Annual Report, in relation to which the ISAs (UK) require us to 
report to you whether we have anything material to add or draw attention to:
• The disclosures in the Annual Report set out on pages 40 to 47 that describe the principal risks and explain how they are being 
managed or mitigated;
• The Directors’ confirmation set out on page 40 in the Annual Report that they have carried out a robust assessment of the principal 
risks facing the entity, including those that would threaten its business model, future performance, solvency or liquidity;
• The Directors’ statement set out on pages 34 to 35 in the financial statements about whether they considered it appropriate to adopt 
the going concern basis of accounting in preparing them, and their identification of any material uncertainties to the entity’s ability to 
continue to do so over a period of at least twelve months from the date of approval of the financial statements;
• Whether the Directors’ statement in relation to going concern required under the Listing Rules in accordance with Listing Rule 
9.8.6R(3) is materially inconsistent with our knowledge obtained in the audit; or 
• The Directors’ explanation set out on pages 34 to 35 in the Annual Report as to how they have assessed the prospects of the entity, 
over what period they have done so and why they consider that period to be appropriate, and their statement as to whether they 
have a reasonable expectation that the entity will be able to continue in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due over the 
period of their assessment, including any related disclosures drawing attention to any necessary qualifications or assumptions.

(full scope)
• The components where we performed full audit procedures accounted for 100% of earnings before 
interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (‘EBITDA’), 100% of revenue and 95% of total assets
Material uncertainty
related to going concern
• We audited management’s going concern assessment and checked that adequate disclosures have been 
made in the financial statements
Materiality • Overall the Group materiality is $6.1 million which represents 2% of EBITDA
Key audit matters 
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement, were of most significance in our audit of the financial 
statements for the current period and include the most significant assessed risks of material misstatement (whether or not due to fraud) 
that we identified. These matters included those which had the greatest effect on: the overall audit strategy, the allocation of resources 
in the audit; and directing the efforts of the engagement team. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial 
statements as a whole, and in our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. EnQuest PLC  Annual Report and Accounts 2017

Risk Our response to the risk Key observations communicated to the Audit Committee 
Estimates of oil and gas reserves Risk direction:
    
Impact of the estimation of the quantity of oil and gas reserves on impairment testing, depreciation, depletion and 
amortisation, decommissioning provisions, going concern assessment and fair value model for Magnus acquisition (Fraud Risk) 
Refer to the Audit Committee Report (pages 60 to 65); Accounting policies (Note 2 of the Annual Report and Accounts); and the Strategic 
Report (pages 40 to 47)
The estimation of oil and gas 
reserves requires significant 
judgement and assumptions by 
management and engineers which 
could be manipulated to achieve 
desired results. These estimates 
have a material impact on the 
financial statements. 
There is technical uncertainty in 
assessing reserve quantities and 
complex contractual arrangements 
dictating EnQuest’s share of 
reserves, particularly the PSAs 
and RSAs and joint venture 
arrangements in place. We will 
focus on management’s estimation 
process including whether bias exists 
in the determination of reserves and 
resources.
The risk has remained the same 
compared to last year.
Our audit procedures have focused on 
management’s estimation process, including 
whether bias exists in the determination of 
reserves, and the role of external specialists in 
reviewing management’s estimations. 
We carried out procedures to understand and 
walkthrough EnQuest’s internal process for oil 
and gas reserves estimation.
We evaluated the competence of internal 
specialists and the competence and objectivity 
of external specialists. We also obtained the 
report of the external specialists on their 
review of the reserves for the UK North Sea 
and Malaysia assets as at 31 December 2017 
and held a meeting with the Chief Petroleum 
Engineer and external specialists to discuss 
their work and findings.
We discussed with the Chief Petroleum 
Engineer and external specialists whether 
management had exercised any bias in 
assumptions used or the outputs produced  
by the reserves estimation exercise. We have 
reviewed the reasonableness of the 
assumptions in the reserves report. We also 
reconciled internal estimates to third party 
reserves reports, and obtained an 
understanding of differences.
We performed analytical procedures to 
identify movements between last year and 
this year. We discussed significant variances 
from expectations with the Chief Petroleum 
Engineer and external specialists to 
understand the movements. 
We used the results of these procedures 
to inform our audit of asset impairment 
testing, the calculation of depreciation, 
depletion and amortisation, the calculation of 
decommissioning provisions, the assessment 
of going concern, the fair value calculation for 
Magnus and reserve disclosures in the Annual 
Report and Accounts.
We have concluded that the estimation of oil 
and gas reserves are in line with appropriate 
methodology and guidelines, and have been 
determined on a reasonable basis through the 
use of competent internal experts and objective 
and competent external specialists.
We did not identify any indication of 
management bias in the estimation process. EnQuest PLC  Annual Report and Accounts 2017

Risk Our response to the risk Key observations communicated to the Audit Committee 
Impairment of the carrying value of tangible and intangible assets (including goodwill) Risk direction:
    
Impairment of production (‘O&G’) assets of ($172 million) and goodwill ($nil) 
Refer to the Audit Committee Report (pages 60 to 65); Accounting policies (from page 109); Note 10 for Impairment in the Annual Report 
and Accounts; and Note 11 for Goodwill in the Annual Report and Accounts.
Despite the low oil price 
environment, there has been a 
recovery in spot oil prices in the 
second half of the year continuing 
into 2018. This creates a potential 
indicator for reversal of previous 
impairments.
There are other judgemental areas 
such as reserves, production and 
cost profiles, which could lead to 
impairment triggers. 
Accounting standards require 
management to assess whether 
indicators of impairment or 
impairment reversal exist. Where 
indicators exist, management must 
carry out an impairment test.
The risk has remained the same 
as last year given the potential 
for both impairments and 
impairment reversals. 
We carried out procedures to understand and 
walkthrough EnQuest’s process for identifying 
impairment triggers, reversal triggers and 
considered management’s assessment 
of indicators.
We audited management’s assessment of 
impairment indicators and whether or not a 
formal impairment test was required.
Where a formal impairment test was necessary, 
we audited management’s assumptions and 
sensitivities. This included specifically the 
determination of cash generating units, cash 
flow projections, oil prices, production profiles, 
capital and operating expenditure, discount 
rates and sensitivities used. In addition we 
engaged our valuation specialists to assist us in 
the audit of discount rates.
We performed the impairment work on 
North Sea assets from our Aberdeen office 
(UK) and the impairment assessment for 
Malaysian assets was led by our London office 
(UK) with assistance from our Kuala Lumpur 
office (Malaysia).
There are a number of factors which have an 
impact on the impairment charge/reversals.  
The impairment calculations are particularly 
sensitive to both reserve estimates, future oil 
prices and discount rates.
In our view the reserves, price and discount rate 
assumptions used by management are within 
reasonable ranges.
Consequently, we believe the net impairment 
charge is appropriate.
Complexity of the deferred taxation calculation Risk direction:
    
Deferred tax expense $193.7 million (2016: $22.1 million credit); deferred tax assets $398.3 million (2016: $206.7 million); and 
deferred tax liabilities $62.7 million (2016: $15 million)
Refer to the Audit Committee Report (pages 60 to 65); Accounting policies (from page 109); and Note 7 of the Annual Report and Accounts.
The calculation of the deferred 
tax balances involves significant 
estimates, including phasing of cash 
flows, future oil prices and reserves, 
which increase the risk of incorrectly 
recording deferred tax.
The risk has remained the same 
compared to last year.
We carried out procedures to understand and 
walkthrough EnQuest’s tax accounting process 
including the approach to calculating deferred tax.
We made enquiries of appropriate personnel 
to understand the process undertaken to 
calculate deferred tax and any assumptions or 
changes in the approach during the year.
We obtained and tested the deferred tax 
calculation to agree the clerical accuracy, 
ensured that the assumptions used were in line 
with expectations and that the calculation and 
recognition was in line with IAS 12: Income taxes.
We challenged the recoverability of material 
deferred tax assets by reconciling the 
expected future taxable income to the 
impairment models.
We performed an analytical review on the 
deferred tax balance and discussed any 
significant movements and any movements not 
within our expectations.
We assessed management’s interpretation and 
application of relevant tax law.
For UK registered companies our Tax teams 
based in Aberdeen (UK) and London (UK) 
performed the work and for Malaysian 
registered companies the tax team in Kuala 
Lumpur (Malaysia) is used.
We conclude that the deferred taxation 
and taxation balances are fairly stated as at 
31 December 2017. EnQuest PLC  Annual Report and Accounts 2017

Risk Our response to the risk Key observations communicated to the Audit Committee 
Complexity of the acquisition accounting for Magnus/Sullom Voe Terminal (‘SVT’). New in 2017
At the date of acquisition, the fair value of the net assets was US$115.4 million. Excess of fair value over consideration of 
$48.7 million arose on acquisition
Refer to the Audit Committee Report (pages 60 to 65); Accounting policies (from page 109); and Note 29 of the Annual Report and Accounts.
EnQuest completed the 
acquisition of 25% of the Magnus 
field along with interests in 
related infrastructure assets 
and operatorship of the SVT 
on 1 December 2017. EnQuest also 
has an option to acquire a further 
75% of the field.
The consideration for this 
acquisition was by way of a vendor 
loan from BP which is repayable 
from the Magnus cash flows and 
other deferred consideration. 
Due to the complexity of the 
SPA and the additional options 
there is a risk that the fair value 
calculation could be incomplete 
and/or the options could be valued 
inappropriately.
We carried out procedures to understand 
and walkthrough EnQuest’s process for 
calculating the purchase price allocation 
(‘PPA’) in relation to this acquisition.
We have audited the PPA and assessed the 
appropriateness of the inputs to the fair value 
calculation. The key inputs included oil price 
assumptions, production profiles, capital and 
operating expenditure, decommissioning 
provisions and discount rates.
We have audited the key assumptions 
and ensured that the methodology and 
application of these are reasonable. 
In addition to this we engaged our valuation 
specialists principally to assist us in the audit 
of discount rates. 
The valuation is complex and is impacted by a 
number of factors. Similar to impairment the 
calculation is sensitive to reserve estimates, 
future oil prices and discount rates.
In our view the reserves, price and discount rate 
assumptions used by management are within 
reasonable ranges.
In addition, the future cost, production profiles, 
and decommissioning cost estimates included in 
the calculation are appropriate.
Consequently, we believe the acquisition has 
been appropriately recorded.
In the prior year, our auditor’s report included a key audit matter in relation to going concern where we made an assessment whether 
going concern met the definition of a key audit matter, whether the appropriate disclosures had been made and discussed what we 
reported to the Audit Committee. Since we have concluded there is a material uncertainty in the current year, we have included a 
section in the auditor’s report: ‘Material uncertainty related to going concern’ to discuss the material uncertainty that may cast 
significant doubt on the Group’s or the parent company’s ability to continue as a going concern. 
An overview of the scope of our audit 
Tailoring the scope
Our assessment of audit risk, our evaluation of materiality and our allocation of performance materiality determine our audit scope for 
each entity within the Group. Taken together, this enables us to form an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. We take into 
account size, risk profile, the organisation of the Group and effectiveness of Group-wide controls and changes in the business 
environment when assessing the level of work to be performed at each entity.
In assessing the risk of material misstatement to the Group financial statements, and to ensure we had adequate quantitative coverage 
of significant accounts in the financial statements, of the two reporting components of the Group, we selected both components 
covering entities within Malaysia and the United Kingdom, which represent the principal business units within the Group.
We performed an audit of the complete financial information of the two full scope components selected as both were selected based on 
their size or risk characteristics. There were no specific scope components for the current year.

REVENUE 100% (2016: 86%) 0%
EBITDA 100% (2016: 89%) 0%
TOTAL ASSETS 95% (2016: 95%) 5%
Of the remaining components that together represent 0% of the Group’s EBITDA, none are individually greater than 1% of the Group’s 
EBITDA. For these components, we performed other procedures, including an overall analytical review, testing of consolidation journals 
and intercompany eliminations to respond to any potential risks of material misstatement to the Group financial statements.
Changes from the prior year 
The Malaysian component has been changed from a specific scope to a full scope component due to its increased share of Group 
EBITDA in 2017.
Involvement with component teams 
In establishing our overall approach to the Group audit, we determined the type of work that needed to be undertaken at each of the 
components audited by us, as the primary audit engagement team, or by component auditors from other EY global network firms 
operating under our instruction. For the UK full scope component (which represents 81% of Group EBITDA), audit procedures were 
performed directly by the primary audit team. For the other full scope component (Malaysia), where the work was performed by 
component auditors, we determined the appropriate level of involvement to enable us to determine that sufficient audit evidence had 
been obtained as a basis for our opinion on the Group as a whole. EnQuest PLC  Annual Report and Accounts 2017

Independent Auditor’s Report CONTINUED
to the Members of EnQuest PLC (Registered number: 07140891)
The primary team (including the Senior Statutory Auditor) interacted regularly with the Malaysia team during various stages of the audit 
including planning of the audit approach, discussing any issues arising from their work and reviewing key working papers, and we were 
responsible for the scope and direction of the audit process. The primary team also attended the audit close meeting with EnQuest 
Malaysia management. This, together with the additional procedures performed at Group level, gave us appropriate evidence for our 
opinion on the Group financial statements.
Our application of materiality 
We apply the concept of materiality in planning and performing the audit, in evaluating the effect of identified misstatements on the 
audit and in forming our audit opinion. 
Materiality
The magnitude of an omission or misstatement that, individually or in the aggregate, could reasonably be expected to influence the 
economic decisions of the users of the financial statements. Materiality provides a basis for determining the nature and extent of our 
audit procedures.
Based on our professional judgement, we determined materiality for the Group to be $6.1 million (2016: $8.9 million), which is 2% (2016: 
2%) of EBITDA (as included in the consolidated financial statements). Materiality has decreased by 31% from the prior year given the 
reduced profitability of the Group.
We believe that EBITDA is the most appropriate basis to use as this is the key performance indicator used by management, it is the main 
performance measure used in the covenant calculations associated with the Group’s debt and is the measure most focused on by stakeholders. 
We determined materiality for the parent company to be $7.8 million (2016: $8.4 million), which is 1% (2016: 1%) of equity. The materiality 
is greater for the parent company as compared to the Group due to the different basis used for determining materiality.
During the course of our audit, we reassessed initial materiality and there has been no significant change in final materiality from our 
original assessment at planning.
Performance materiality
The application of materiality at the individual account or balance level. It is set at an amount to reduce to an appropriately low level the 
probability that the aggregate of uncorrected and undetected misstatements exceeds materiality.
On the basis of our risk assessments, together with our assessment of the Group’s overall control environment, our judgement was that 
performance materiality should be 50% (2016: 50%) of our planning materiality, namely $3.05 million (2016: $4.5 million). We have set 
performance materiality at this percentage due to our understanding of the entity and past experience with the engagement indicating 
a higher risk of misstatements.
Audit work at component locations for the purpose of obtaining audit coverage over significant financial statement accounts is 
undertaken based on a percentage of total performance materiality. The performance materiality set for each component is based on 
the relative scale and risk of the component to the Group as a whole and our assessment of the risk of misstatement at that component. 
In the current year, the performance materiality allocated to components was $2.78 million for the North Sea (2016: $4.45 million) and 
$1.24 million for Malaysia (2016: $2 million). 
Reporting threshold
An amount below which identified misstatements are considered as being clearly trivial.
We identify and capture misstatements above $0.3 million (2016: $0.4 million) which is set at 5% of planning materiality. We agreed with 
the Audit Committee that we would report to them all uncorrected audit differences in excess of $1 million, as well as differences below 
that threshold that, in our view, warranted reporting on qualitative grounds. We evaluate any uncorrected misstatements against both 
the quantitative measures of materiality discussed above and in light of other relevant qualitative considerations in forming our opinion.
Other information 
The other information comprises the information included in the Annual Report other than the financial statements and our auditor’s 
report thereon. The Directors are responsible for the other information. 
Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and, except to the extent otherwise explicitly stated in this 
report, we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon. 
In connection with our audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider 
whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit or 
otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If we identify such material inconsistencies or apparent material misstatements, we are 
required to determine whether there is a material misstatement in the financial statements or a material misstatement of the other 
information. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of the other information, we 
are required to report that fact.
We have nothing to report in this regard. EnQuest PLC  Annual Report and Accounts 2017

STATEMENTS
In this context, we also have nothing to report in regard to our responsibility to specifically address the following items in the other 
information and to report as uncorrected material misstatements of the other information where we conclude that those items meet the 
following conditions:
• Fair, balanced and understandable, set out on page 61 – the statement given by the Directors that they consider the Annual Report 
and financial statements taken as a whole is fair, balanced and understandable and provides the information necessary for 
shareholders to assess the Group’s performance, business model and strategy, is materially inconsistent with our knowledge 
obtained in the audit; or 
• Audit Committee reporting, set out on pages 60 to 65 – the section describing the work of the Audit Committee does not 
appropriately address matters communicated by us to the audit committee; or
• Directors’ statement of compliance with the UK Corporate Governance Code, set out on page 56 to 59 – the parts of the 
Directors’ statement required under the Listing Rules relating to the Company’s compliance with the UK Corporate Governance 
Code containing provisions specified for review by the auditor in accordance with Listing Rule 9.8.10R(2) do not properly disclose a 
departure from a relevant provision of the UK Corporate Governance Code.
Opinions on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006
In our opinion, the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited has been properly prepared in accordance with the 
Companies Act 2006.
In our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of the audit:
• The information given in the Strategic Report and the Directors’ Report for the financial year for which the financial statements are 
prepared is consistent with the financial statements; and 
• The Strategic Report and the Directors’ Report have been prepared in accordance with applicable legal requirements.
Matters on which we are required to report by exception
In the light of the knowledge and understanding of the Group and the parent company and its environment obtained in the course of 
the audit, we have not identified material misstatements in the Strategic Report or the Directors’ Report.
We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters in relation to which the Companies Act 2006 requires us to report to you if, 
in our opinion:
• Adequate accounting records have not been kept by the parent company, or returns adequate for our audit have not been received 
from branches not visited by us; or
• The parent company financial statements and the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited are not in agreement with 
the accounting records and returns; or
• Certain disclosures of Directors’ remuneration specified by law are not made; or
• We have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit.
Responsibilities of Directors
As explained more fully in the Directors’ responsibilities statement, set out on page 96, the Directors are responsible for the preparation 
of the financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view, and for such internal control as the directors 
determine is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud 
or error. 
In preparing the financial statements, the directors are responsible for assessing the Group and parent company’s ability to continue as 
a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the 
directors either intend to liquidate the Group or the parent company or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.
Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements 
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material 
misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high 
level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs (UK) will always detect a material 
misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, 
they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements. 
Explanation as to what extent the audit was considered capable of detecting irregularities, including fraud 
The objectives of our audit, in respect to fraud, are; to identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements 
due to fraud; to obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the assessed risks of material misstatement due to fraud, through 
designing and implementing appropriate responses; and to respond appropriately to fraud or suspected fraud identified during the 
audit. However, the primary responsibility for the prevention and detection of fraud rests with both those charged with governance of 
the entity and management. 
Our approach was as follows: 
• We obtained an understanding of the legal and regulatory frameworks that are applicable to the Group and determined that the 
most significant frameworks which are directly relevant to specific assertions in the financial statements are those that relate to the 
reporting framework (IFRS, FRS 101, the Companies Act 2006 and UK Corporate Governance Code) and the relevant tax compliance 
regulations in the jurisdictions in which the Group operates. In addition, we concluded that there are certain significant laws and 
regulations which may have an effect on the determination of the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements being the 
Listing Rules of the UK Listing Authority, and those laws and regulations relating to health and safety and employee matters.
• We understood how EnQuest PLC is complying with those frameworks by making enquiries of management, those responsible for 
legal and compliance procedures and the Company Secretary. We corroborated our enquiries through our review of Board minutes, 
papers provided to the Audit Committee and correspondence received from regulatory bodies. We obtained the Code of Business 
conduct and employee handbook updated as at May 2017 which is provided to all employees and those charged with governance 
which indicates a culture of honesty and ethical behaviour and with an emphasis on fraud prevention, which may reduce 
opportunities for fraud to take place. Inquiries were made of those charged with governance in part to corroborate the responses to 
the inquiries of management. EnQuest PLC  Annual Report and Accounts 2017
104
• We assessed the susceptibility of the Group’s financial statements to material misstatement, including how fraud might occur, by 
meeting with management from various parts of the business to understand where it considered there was susceptibility to fraud.  
We considered the programs and controls that the Group has established to address risks identified, or that otherwise prevent, deter 
and detect fraud; and how senior management monitors those programs and controls. Where the risk was considered to be higher, 
we performed audit procedures to address each identified fraud risk. These procedures included testing manual journals and were 
designed to provide reasonable assurance that the financial statements were free from fraud or error.
• Based on this understanding we designed our audit procedures to identify non-compliance with such laws and regulations identified 
in the paragraphs above. Our procedures involved: journal entry testing, with a focus on manual consolidation journals and journals 
indicating large or unusual transactions based on our understanding of the business; enquiries of legal counsel, Group management, 
location management in all full scope entities; and focused testing, as referred to in the key audit matters section above.
A further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements is located on the Financial Reporting Council’s 
website at https://www.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities. This description forms part of our auditor’s report.
Other matters we are required to address 
• We were appointed by the Board of Directors in 2010 to audit the financial statements for the year ending 31 December 2010 and 
subsequent financial periods.
• The period of total uninterrupted engagement including previous renewals and reappointments is eight years, covering the years 
ended 31 December 2010 to 31 December 2017. The non-audit services prohibited by the FRC’s Ethical Standard were not provided 
to the Group or the parent company and we remain independent of the Group and the parent company in conducting the audit. 
• The audit opinion is consistent with the additional report to the Audit Committee.

Notes to the Group Financial Statements
For the year ended 31 December 2017
1. Corporate information 
EnQuest PLC (‘EnQuest’ or the ‘Company’) is a limited liability company incorporated and registered in England and is listed on the 
London Stock Exchange and on the Stockholm NASDAQ OMX. 
The principal activities of the Company and its subsidiaries (together the ‘Group’) is to enhance hydrocarbon recovery and extend the 
useful lives of mature and underdeveloped assets and associated infrastructure in a profitable and responsible manner.
The Group’s financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2017 were authorised for issue in accordance with a resolution of the 
Board of Directors on 19 March 2018.
A listing of the Group companies is contained in note 28 to these Group financial statements.
2. Summary of significant accounting policies 
New standards and interpretations
The Group has adopted and applied the following standards that are relevant to its operations for the first time for the annual reporting 
period commencing 1 January 2017:
• Amendments to IAS 12 Income Taxes – Recognition of Deferred Tax Assets for Unrealised Losses;
• Annual Improvements to IFRSs (2014 – 2016 Cycle): IFRS 12 Disclosure of interests in other entities; and
• Disclosure Initiative Amendments – IAS 7 Statement of Cash Flows.
There were no new standards or interpretations effective for the first time for periods beginning on or after 1 January 2017 that had a 
significant effect on the Group’s financial statements, although an amendment to IAS 7 Statement of Cash Flows has resulted in a 
reconciliation of liabilities disclosed for the first time in note 30.
Standards issued but not yet effective
Standards issued and relevant to the Group, but not yet effective up to the date of issuance of the Group’s financial statements, are 
listed below. This listing is of standards and interpretations issued, which the Group reasonably expects to be applicable at a future 
date. The Group intends to adopt these standards when they become effective. The Directors do not anticipate that the adoption of 
these standards will have a material impact on the Group’s financial statements in the period of initial application.
IFRS 9 Financial Instruments
In July 2014, the IASB issued the final version of IFRS 9 Financial Instruments which replaces IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition 
and Measurement and all previous versions of IFRS 9. The standard introduces new requirements for classification and measurement, 
impairment under the ‘expected credit loss’ (‘ECL’) model and hedge accounting. IFRS 9 is effective for annual periods beginning on or 
after 1 January 2018, with early application permitted. The Group plans to adopt the new standard on the required effective date and 
will not restate comparative information. 
During 2017, the Group has performed an impact assessment for the application of IFRS 9. This assessment is based on currently 
available information and may be subject to changes arising from further reasonable and supportable information being made available 
to the Group in 2018 when the Group will adopt IFRS 9. The Group continues to assess its accounting processes, controls and policies on 
an on-going basis.
Classification and measurement
The Group expects that all financial assets will continue to be measured at amortised cost or fair value and will be measured on the 
same basis as is currently adopted under IAS 39.
The Group has not designated any financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss (‘FVTPL’) and the assessment did not indicate any 
material impact regarding the classification of financial liabilities. The Group does not currently designate any hedge relationships for 
hedge accounting. 
Impairment
The Group’s receivables have a good credit rating, hence the expected credit losses are low (see note 15). There has been no noted 
change in the credit risk of receivables in the year, therefore the Group does not believe that the new ECL impairment methodology will 
have a material impact on the valuation of financial assets. 
Non-current assets are held with reputable businesses with whom the Group has good working relationships. The scheduled repayment 
of cash flows have been and continue to be received in line with expectations. There has been no noted change in the credit risk of 
receivables in the year, therefore the Group does not believe that the new ECL impairment methodology will have a material impact on 
the valuation of financial assets. 
Cash is held with bank and financial institution counterparties, which are rated with an A-/A3 credit rating or better (see note 16). The 
Group considers that the available cash balances have low credit risk based on the external credit rating of the counterparties.
Modification of debt
In July 2017 the IASB confirmed the accounting for modifications of financial liabilities under IFRS 9. When a financial liability measured at 
amortised cost is modified without this resulting in derecognition, a gain or loss should be recognised in profit or loss. The gain or loss is 
calculated as the difference between the original contractual cash flows and the modified cash flows discounted at the original effective 
interest rate. Any fees and costs incurred are amortised over the remaining term of the asset.
During the 2016 refinancing, the modification of the Bonds was not considered to be significant. As a result, the change in contractual 
cash flows on the Bonds was amortised over the new life of the bonds, rather than taken straight to profit or loss (see note 19). Under 
IFRS 9, the refinancing is a modification of the debt in which the difference in contractual cash flows should be taken straight to profit or 
loss. On the implementation of IFRS 9 on 1 January 2018, an adjustment will be taken through opening reserves and through the value of 
both bonds, High Yield Bond and Retail Bond of $34.0 million ($9.2 million and $24.8 million respectively). EnQuest PLC  Annual Report and Accounts 2017

IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers
IFRS 15 was issued in May 2014, and amended in April 2016, and establishes a single comprehensive model that will apply to revenue 
arising from contracts with customers. IFRS 15 will supersede the current revenue recognition guidance including IAS 18 Revenue and 
related interpretations when it becomes effective, for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018.
The core principle of IFRS 15 is that an entity should recognise revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to 
customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or 
services. The five step model recognises revenue when (or as) a performance obligation is satisfied, i.e. when ‘control’ of the goods or 
services underlying the particular performance obligation is transferred to the customer. Extensive new disclosures are required by 
IFRS 15.
During 2017, the Group has performed an impact assessment for the application of IFRS 15. This assessment is based on currently 
available information and may be subject to changes arising from further reasonable and supportable information being made 
available to the Group in 2018 when the Group will adopt IFRS 15. The Group continues to assess its accounting processes, controls 
and policies on an on-going basis. The Group plans to adopt the new standard on the required effective date using the modified 
retrospective method.
The Group recognises revenue from the following major sources: 
• Sale of crude oil, gas and condensate;
• Tariff revenue for the use of Group infrastructure;
• Production imbalances.
Interest income and dividend income from debt and equity investments were covered by IAS 18. These are now within the scope of IFRS 9.
Sale of crude oil, gas and condensate
The Directors have assessed the sale of crude oil, gas or condensate and determined that these represent a single performance 
obligation, being the sale of barrels equivalent on collection of a cargo or on delivery of commodity into an infrastructure. Revenue will 
accordingly be recognised for this performance obligation when control over the corresponding commodity is transferred to the 
customer. This is in line with the current recognition of revenue under IAS 18. Variable revenue conditions can arise on either party based 
on the failure to provide commitments detailed within the contract. These variations arise as an event occurs and therefore the 
transaction price is known at the timing of the performance obligations with no judgement required. Revenue recognition is therefore 
consistent with current practice.
A Production Sharing Contract (‘PSC’) is in place in Malaysia with Petronas, the custodian for Malaysia’s national oil and gas resources. 
The production is shared in line with the risks and benefits that result from the activity of the PSC and therefore this is a collaborative 
arrangement. Revenue is recognised on the sale of the crude oil, as per the analysis of sale of crude oil above. This is in line with the 
current recognition of revenue under IAS 18.
Tariff revenue for the use of Group infrastructure 
The Directors have assessed the revenue arising from tariffs, which are charged to customers for the use of infrastructure owned by the 
Group in the North Sea. There is one contract per customer which is for a period of 12 months of less and is based on one performance 
obligation for the use of Group assets. The use of the assets is not separable as they are all dependent on one another in order to fulfil 
the contract and no one item of infrastructure can be individually identified. Revenue will accordingly be recognised over the 
performance of the contract as services are provided for the use of the infrastructure on a throughput basis. Revenue recognition is 
therefore consistent with current practice under IAS 18. 
Production imbalances
Production imbalances arise on fields as oil is lifted per each joint venture party, resulting in a variance in the volume of oil lifted versus 
the entitlement per owner per their working interest. The change in production imbalances is currently taken through cost of sales (see 
note 5(b)) at fair value at the date of lifting. All Group fields are operated through a Joint Venture Agreement (‘JVA’) through which 
production imbalances are settled. These transactions are settled by the JVA through lifting schedules and are not settled in cash, with 
the exception of a misbalance at the cessation of contract.
These are collaborative agreements through the JVA and non-monetary exchanges, and therefore do not meet the definition of a 
customer under IFRS 15. Production imbalances will continue to be recognised through cost of sales, as per the current accounting 
treatment, with no change on the application of IFRS 15.
IFRS 16 Leases
IFRS 16 Leases, issued in January 2016, sets out the principles for the recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of leases 
for both lessors and lessees. It replaces the previous leases standard IAS 17 Leases and is effective from 1 January 2019.
IFRS 16 introduces a single, on-balance sheet lease accounting model for lessees. A lessee recognises a right-of-use asset representing 
its right to use the underlying asset and a lease liability representing its obligation to make lease payments. There are recognition 
exemptions for short-term leases and leases of low-value items. Lessor accounting remains similar to the current standard i.e. lessors 
continue to classify leases as finance or operating leases.

CORPORATE 
GOVERNANCE
FINANCIAL 
STATEMENTS
The Group has completed an initial assessment of the potential impact on its consolidated financial statements, but has not yet 
completed its detailed assessment. The actual impact of applying IFRS 16 on the financial statements in the period of initial application 
will depend on future economic conditions, including the Group’s borrowing rate at 1 January 2019, the composition of the Group’s 
lease portfolio at that date, the Group’s latest assessment of whether it will exercise any lease renewal options and the extent to which 
the Group chooses to use practical expedients and recognition exemptions. 
As at 31 December 2017, the Group has non-cancellable operating lease commitments of $110 million (see note 24). A preliminary 
assessment indicates that these arrangements will meet the definition of a lease under IFRS 16, and hence the Group will recognise a 
right-of-use asset and a corresponding liability in respect of these leases, unless they qualify for low value or short-term leases upon the 
application of IFRS 16. The new requirement to recognise a right-of-use asset and a related lease liability is expected to have a 
significant impact on the amounts recognised in the Group’s consolidated financial statements and the Directors are currently assessing 
its potential impact. It is not practicable to provide a reasonable estimate of the financial effect until the Directors complete the review. 
The Group plans to apply the practical expedient to grandfather the definition of a lease on transition. This means that it will apply  
IFRS 16 to all contracts entered into before 1 January 2019 and identified as leases in accordance with IAS 17. Contracts which have not 
been considered or identified as a lease will continue to be accounted for in line with their historical treatment. 
In contrast, for finance leases where the Group is a lessee, as the Group has already recognised an asset and a related finance lease 
liability for the lease arrangement, and in cases where the Group is a lessor (for both operating and finance leases), the Directors of the 
Company do not anticipate that the application of IFRS 16 will have a significant impact on the amounts recognised in the Group’s 
consolidated financial statements. 
Basis of preparation
The Group financial information has been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (‘IFRS’) as adopted 
by the European Union as they apply to the financial statements of the Group for the year ended 31 December 2017 and applied in 
accordance with the Companies Act 2006. The accounting policies which follow set out those policies which apply in preparing the 
financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2017.
The Group financial information has been prepared on an historical cost basis, except for the fair value remeasurement of certain 
financial instruments, including derivatives, as set out in the accounting policies below. The presentation currency of the Group financial 
information is United States Dollars and all values in the Group financial information are rounded to the nearest thousand ($’000) except 
where otherwise stated.
The financial statements have been prepared on the going concern basis. Further information relating to the use of the going concern 
assumption is provided in the ‘Going Concern’ section of the Financial Review.
Basis of consolidation
Subsidiaries
Subsidiaries are all entities over which the Group has the sole right to exercise control over the operations and govern the financial 
policies generally accompanying a shareholding of more than half of the voting rights. The existence and effect of potential voting rights 
that are currently exercisable or convertible are considered when assessing the Group’s control. Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from 
the date on which control is transferred to the Group and are de-consolidated from the date that control ceases.
Intercompany profits, transactions and balances are eliminated on consolidation. Accounting policies of subsidiaries have been changed 
where necessary to ensure consistency with the policies adopted by the Group.
Joint arrangements
Oil and gas operations are usually conducted by the Group as co-licensees in unincorporated joint operations with other companies. 
Joint control is the contractually agreed sharing of control of an arrangement, which exists only when decisions about the relevant 
activities require the consent of the relevant parties sharing control.
Most of the Group’s activities are conducted through joint operations, whereby the parties that have joint control of the arrangement 
have the rights to the assets, and obligations for the liabilities, relating to the arrangement. The Group reports its interests in joint 
operations using proportionate consolidation – the Group’s share of the production, assets, liabilities, income and expenses of the joint 
operation are combined with the equivalent items in the consolidated financial statements on a line-by-line basis.
Business combinations
Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method. The cost of an acquisition is measured as the aggregate of the 
consideration transferred, measured at acquisition date fair value, and the amount of any controlling interest in the acquiree. For each 
business combination, the acquirer measures the non-controlling interest in the acquiree either at fair value or at the proportionate 
share of the acquiree’s identifiable net assets. Those petroleum reserves and resources that are able to be reliably valued are recognised 
in the assessment of fair values on acquisition. Other potential reserves, resources and rights, for which fair values cannot be reliably 
determined, are not recognised.
Where applicable, the consideration for the acquisition includes any asset or liability resulting from a contingent consideration 
arrangement, measured at its acquisition-date fair value. Subsequent changes in such fair values are adjusted against the cost of 
acquisition where they qualify as measurement period adjustments. All other subsequent changes in the fair value of contingent 
consideration classified as a financial liability are remeasured through profit or loss. If the contingent consideration is not within the 
scope of IAS 39, it is measured at fair value in accordance with the appropriate IFRS. Contingent consideration that is classified as equity 
is not remeasured and subsequent settlement is accounted for within equity. EnQuest PLC  Annual Report and Accounts 2017
112
Notes to the Group Financial Statements CONTINUED
For the year ended 31 December 2017
If the initial accounting for a business combination is incomplete by the end of the reporting period in which the combination occurs, the 
Group reports provisional amounts for the items for which the accounting is incomplete. Those provisional amounts are adjusted during 
the measurement period (see below), or additional assets or liabilities are recognised to reflect new information obtained about facts 
and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date that, if known, would have affected the amounts recognised as of that date.
The measurement period is the period from the date of acquisition to the date the Group obtains complete information about facts and 
circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date, and is subject to a maximum of one year.
Goodwill 
Goodwill arising on a business combination is initially measured at cost, being the excess of the cost of the business combination over 
the net fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of the entity at the date of acquisition. 
If the fair value of the net assets acquired is in excess of the aggregate consideration transferred, the Group re-assesses whether it has 
correctly identified all of the assets acquired and all of the liabilities assumed and reviews the procedures used to measure the amounts 
to be recognised at the acquisition date. If the reassessment still results in an excess of the fair value of net assets acquired over the 
aggregate consideration transferred, the gain is recognised in profit or loss.
Following initial recognition, goodwill is stated at cost less any accumulated impairment losses. Goodwill is reviewed for impairment 
annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that such carrying value may be impaired. 
For the purposes of impairment testing, goodwill acquired is allocated to the cash generating units (‘CGU’) that are expected to benefit 
from the synergies of the combination. Each unit or units to which goodwill is allocated represents the lowest level within the Group at 
which the goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes. 
Impairment is determined by assessing the recoverable amount of the cash generating unit to which the goodwill relates. Where the 
recoverable amount of the CGU is less than the carrying amount of the CGU and related goodwill, an impairment loss is recognised. 
Impairment losses relating to goodwill cannot be reversed in future periods.
Critical accounting estimates and judgements
The management of the Group has to make estimates and judgements when preparing the financial statements of the Group. 
Uncertainties in the estimates and judgements could have an impact on the carrying amount of assets and liabilities and the Group’s 
result. The most important estimates and judgements in relation thereto are:
Estimates in oil and gas reserves
The business of the Group is to enhance hydrocarbon recovery and extend the useful lives of mature and underdeveloped assets and 
associated infrastructure in a profitable and responsible manner. Estimates of oil and gas reserves are used in the calculations for 
impairment tests and accounting for depletion and decommissioning. Changes in estimates of oil and gas reserves resulting in different 
future production profiles will affect the discounted cash flows used in impairment testing, the anticipated date of decommissioning and 
the depletion charges in accordance with the unit of production method.
Estimates in impairment of oil and gas assets, goodwill and the estimate of the cost recovery provision
Determination of whether oil and gas assets or goodwill have suffered any impairment requires an estimation of the fair value less costs 
to dispose of the CGU to which oil and gas assets and goodwill have been allocated. The calculation requires the entity to estimate the 
future cash flows expected to arise from the CGU using discounted cash flow models comprising asset-by-asset life of field projections 
using Level 3 inputs (based on IFRS 13 fair value hierarchy). Key assumptions and estimates in the impairment models relate to: 
commodity prices that are based on forward curve prices for the first three years and thereafter at $70/bbl inflated at 2.0% per annum 
from 2022; discount rates derived from the Group’s post-tax weighted average cost of capital of 10.0% (2016: 10.0%); commercial 
reserves and the related cost profiles. As the production and related cash flows can be estimated from EnQuest’s experience, 
management believes that the estimated cash flows expected to be generated over the life of each field is the appropriate basis upon 
which to assess goodwill and individual assets for impairment.
These same models and assumptions are used in the calculation of the cost recovery provision (see note 22). 
Determining the fair value of property, plant and equipment on business combinations
The Group determines the fair value of property, plant and equipment acquired in a business combination based on the discounted 
cash flows at the time of acquisition from the proven and probable reserves. In assessing the discounted cash flows, the estimated future 
cash flows attributable to the asset are discounted to their present value using a discount rate that reflects the market assessments of 
the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset at the time of the acquisition. In calculating the asset fair value the Group will 
apply a forward curve followed by an oil price assumption representing management’s view of the long-term oil price. 
Decommissioning provision 
Amounts used in recording a provision for decommissioning are estimates based on current legal and constructive requirements and 
current technology and price levels for the removal of facilities and plugging and abandoning of wells. Due to changes in relation to 
these items, the future actual cash outflows in relation to decommissioning are likely to differ in practice. To reflect the effects due to 
changes in legislation, requirements and technology and price levels, the carrying amounts of decommissioning provisions are reviewed 
on a regular basis. 
The effects of changes in estimates do not give rise to prior year adjustments and are dealt with prospectively. While the Group uses its 
best estimates and judgement, actual results could differ from these estimates.
In estimating decommissioning provisions, the Group applies an annual inflation rate of 2.0% (2016: 2.0%) and an annual discount rate of 
2.0% (2016: 2.3%).

GOVERNANCE
FINANCIAL 
STATEMENTS
Debt restructuring
The Group undertook debt restructuring during 2016 resulting in a substantial modification of the terms of its Revolving Credit Facility 
(‘RCF’) (see note 19). Accordingly, extinguishment accounting was applied, resulting in the derecognition of the carrying value of the 
facility, including any unamortised arrangement fees, and the recognition of a new financial liability for the revised facility at fair value. 
Costs associated with the renegotiation of the facility were expensed to the income statement as exceptional finance costs (see note 4).
Going concern
The Directors’ assessment of going concern concludes that the use of the going concern basis is appropriate and that, notwithstanding 
the material uncertainty as provided in the ‘Going Concern’ section of the Financial Review, the Directors have a reasonable expectation 
that the Group will be able to continue in operation and meet its commitments as they fall due over the going concern period.
The going concern assumption is highly sensitive to economic conditions. The Group closely monitors and manages its funding position 
and liquidity risk throughout the year, including monitoring forecast covenant results, to ensure it has access to sufficient funds to meet 
forecast cash requirements. Cash forecasts are regularly produced and sensitivities considered for, but not limited to, changes in crude 
oil prices (adjusted for hedging undertaken by the Group), production rates and development project timing and costs. These forecasts 
and sensitivity analyses allow management to mitigate any liquidity or covenant compliance risks in a timely manner. See the Financial 
Review for further details.
Taxation
The Group’s operations are subject to a number of specific tax rules which apply to exploration, development and production. In 
addition, the tax provision is prepared before the relevant companies have filed their tax returns with the relevant tax authorities and, 
significantly, before these have been agreed. As a result of these factors, the tax provision process necessarily involves the use of a 
number of estimates and judgements including those required in calculating the effective tax rate. In considering the tax on exceptional 
items, the Group applies the appropriate statutory tax rate to each item to calculate the relevant tax charge on exceptional items.
The Group recognises deferred tax assets on unused tax losses where it is probable that future taxable profits will be available for 
utilisation. This requires management to make judgements and assumptions regarding the likelihood of future taxable profits and the 
amount of deferred tax that can be recognised. 
Foreign currencies
Items included in the financial statements of each of the Group’s entities are measured using the currency of the primary economic 
environment in which the entity operates (functional currency). The Group financial statements are presented in United States Dollars ($), 
the currency which the Group has elected to use as its presentation currency.
In the accounts of the Company and its individual subsidiaries, transactions in currencies other than a company’s functional currency are 
recorded at the prevailing rate of exchange on the date of the transaction. At the year end, monetary assets and liabilities denominated 
in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rates of exchange prevailing at the balance sheet date. Non-monetary assets and liabilities 
that are measured at historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the rate of exchange as at the dates of the initial 
transactions. Non-monetary assets and liabilities measured at fair value in a foreign currency are translated using the rate of exchange at 
the date the fair value was determined. All foreign exchange gains and losses are taken to profit and loss in the statement of 
comprehensive income. 
Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and any impairment in value. Cost comprises the 
purchase price or construction cost and any costs directly attributable to making that asset capable of operating as intended by 
management. The purchase price or construction cost is the aggregate amount paid and the fair value of any other consideration given 
to acquire the asset. 
Oil and gas assets are depleted, on a field-by-field basis, using the unit of production method based on entitlement to proven and 
probable reserves, taking account of estimated future development expenditure relating to those reserves. 
Depreciation on other elements of property, plant and equipment is provided on a straight line basis at the following rates:
Office furniture and equipment  5 years
Fixtures and fittings  10 years
Long leasehold land  period of lease
Each asset’s estimated useful life, residual value and method of depreciation are reviewed and adjusted if appropriate at each financial 
year end.
No depreciation is charged on assets under construction.  EnQuest PLC  Annual Report and Accounts 2017

Notes to the Group Financial Statements CONTINUED
For the year ended 31 December 2017
Oil and gas assets
Exploration and appraisal assets
The Group adopts the successful efforts method of accounting for exploration and evaluation costs. Pre-licence costs are expensed in the 
period in which they are incurred. Expenditure directly associated with exploration, evaluation or appraisal activities is initially capitalised 
as an intangible asset. Such costs include the costs of acquiring an interest, appraisal well drilling costs, payments to contractors and an 
appropriate share of directly attributable overheads incurred during the evaluation phase. For such appraisal activity, which may require 
drilling of further wells, costs continue to be carried as an asset whilst related hydrocarbons are considered capable of commercial 
development. Such costs are subject to technical, commercial and management review to confirm the continued intent to develop, or 
otherwise extract value. When this is no longer the case, the costs are written off as exploration and evaluation expenses in the statement 
of comprehensive income. When exploration licences are relinquished without further development, any previous impairment loss is 
reversed and the carrying costs are written off through the statement of comprehensive income. When assets are declared part of a 
commercial development, related costs are transferred to property, plant and equipment. All intangible oil and gas assets are assessed for 
any impairment prior to transfer and any impairment loss is recognised in the statement of comprehensive income. 
Development assets
Expenditure relating to development of assets including the construction, installation and completion of infrastructure facilities such as 
platforms, pipelines and development wells, is capitalised within property, plant and equipment.
Farm-outs – in the exploration and evaluation phase
The Group does not record any expenditure made by the farmee on its account. In the event of a partial farm-out, the Group also does 
not recognise any gain or loss on its exploration and evaluation farm-out arrangements but redesignates any costs previously 
capitalised in relation to the whole interest as relating to the partial interest retained. Any cash consideration received directly from the 
farmee is credited against costs previously capitalised in relation to the whole interest with any excess accounted for by the farmor as a 
gain on disposal.
Farm-outs – outside the exploration and evaluation phase
In accounting for a farm-out arrangement outside the exploration and evaluation phase, the Group:
• Derecognises the proportion of the asset that it has sold to the farmee;
• Recognises the consideration received or receivable from the farmee, which represents the cash received and/or the farmee’s 
obligation to fund the capital expenditure in relation to the interest retained by the farmor and/or any deferred consideration;
• Recognises a gain or loss on the transaction for the difference between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the 
asset disposed of. A gain is only recognised when the value of the consideration can be determined reliably. If not, then the Group 
accounts for the consideration received as a reduction in the carrying amount of the underlying assets; and
• Tests the retained interests for impairment if the terms of the arrangement indicate that the retained interest may be impaired.
The consideration receivable on disposal of an item of property, plant and equipment or an intangible asset is recognised initially at its 
fair value by the Group. However, if payment for the item is deferred, the consideration received is recognised initially at the cash price 
equivalent. The difference between the nominal amount of the consideration and the cash price equivalent is recognised as interest 
revenue. Any part of the consideration that is receivable in the form of cash is treated as a financial asset and is accounted for at 
amortised cost.
Carry arrangements
Where amounts are paid on behalf of a carried party these are capitalised. Where there is an obligation to make payments on behalf of a 
carried party and the timing and amount are uncertain, a provision is recognised. Where the payment is a fixed monetary amount, a 
financial liability is recognised.
Changes in unit of production factors
Changes in factors which affect unit of production calculations are dealt with prospectively, not by immediate adjustment of prior 
years’ amounts.
Borrowing costs
Borrowing costs directly attributable to the construction of qualifying assets, which are assets that necessarily take a substantial period 
of time to prepare for their intended use, are added to the cost of those assets, until such time as the assets are substantially ready for 
their intended use. All other borrowing costs are recognised as interest payable in the statement of comprehensive income in 
accordance with the effective interest method.
Impairment of tangible and intangible assets (excluding goodwill)
At each balance sheet date, the Group reviews the carrying amounts of its oil and gas assets to assess whether there is an indication that 
those assets may be impaired. If any such indication exists, the Group makes an estimate of the asset’s recoverable amount. An asset’s 
recoverable amount is the higher of an asset’s fair value less costs of disposal and its value in use. In assessing value in use, the 
estimated future cash flows attributable to the asset are discounted to their present value using a post tax discount rate that reflects 
current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset.
If the recoverable amount of an asset is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount of the asset is reduced to its 
recoverable amount. An impairment loss is recognised immediately in the statement of comprehensive income.
Where an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset is increased to the revised estimate of its recoverable 
amount, but only so that the increased carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined had no 
impairment loss been recognised for the asset in prior years. A reversal of an impairment loss is recognised immediately in the 
statement of comprehensive income.

STRATEGIC 
REPORT
CORPORATE 
GOVERNANCE
FINANCIAL 
STATEMENTS
Non-current assets held for sale
Non-current assets classified as held for sale are measured at the lower of carrying amount and fair value less costs of disposal. 
Non-current assets are classified as held for sale if their carrying amount will be recovered through a sale transaction rather than through 
continuing use. This condition is regarded as met only when the sale is highly probable and the asset is available for immediate sale in its 
present condition. Management must be committed to the sale which should be expected to qualify for recognition as a completed sale 
within one year from the date of classification.
Financial assets
Financial assets within the scope of IAS 39 are classified as financial assets at fair value through profit or loss, loans and receivables, 
held-to-maturity investments, available-for-sale financial investments, or as derivatives designated as hedging instruments in an 
effective hedge, as appropriate. The Group determines the classification of its financial assets at initial recognition.
All assets are recognised initially at fair value plus transaction costs, except in the case of financial assets recorded at fair value through 
profit or loss.
Purchases or sales of financial assets that require delivery of assets within a timeframe established by regulation or convention in the 
marketplace (regular way trades) are recognised on the trade date.
The Group’s financial assets include cash and short-term deposits, trade and other receivables, loans and other receivables, quoted and 
unquoted financial instruments and derivative financial instruments.
Subsequent measurement of financial assets depends on their classification as described below:
Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss (‘FVTPL’)
Financial assets are classified as at FVTPL when the financial asset is either held for trading or designated as at FVTPL. Financial assets 
are classified as held for trading if they are acquired for the purpose of selling or repurchasing in the near term. Derivatives are also 
classified as held for trading unless they are designated as effective hedging instruments as defined by IAS 39. 
Financial assets at FVTPL, including commodity and foreign exchange derivatives, are stated at fair value, with any gains or losses arising 
on remeasurement recognised immediately in the income statement.
Financial assets designated upon initial recognition at FVTPL are designated at their initial recognition date and only if the criteria under 
IAS 39 are satisfied.
Available-for-sale financial investments
Listed and unlisted shares held by the Group that are traded in an active market are classified as being available-for-sale and are stated 
at fair value. Gains and losses arising from changes in fair value are recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated in the 
available-for-sale reserve with the exception of impairment losses which are recognised directly in profit or loss. Where the investment is 
disposed of or is determined to be impaired, the cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in the available-for-sale reserve is 
reclassified to profit or loss. 
Loans and receivables 
These include trade receivables, loans and other receivables that have fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active 
market and are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, less any impairment. Interest income is recognised by 
applying the effective interest rate, except for short-term receivables when the recognition of interest would be immaterial.
Impairment of financial assets
The Group assesses, at each reporting date, whether there is any objective evidence that a financial asset is impaired. A financial asset is 
deemed to be impaired where there is objective evidence of impairment that, as a result of one or more events that have occurred after 
the initial recognition of the asset, the estimated future cash flows of the investment have been affected.
For listed and unlisted equity investments classified as available-for-sale, a significant or prolonged decline in the fair value of the 
security below its cost is considered to be objective evidence of impairment. When an available-for-sale financial asset is considered to 
be impaired, cumulative gains and losses previously recognised in other comprehensive income are reclassified to profit or loss in the 
period. In respect of equity securities, impairment losses previously recognised in profit or loss are not reversed through profit or loss 
but through other comprehensive income. Any increase in fair value subsequent to an impairment loss is recognised in other 
comprehensive income.
For financial assets carried at amortised cost, the amount of the impairment is the difference between the asset’s carrying amount and 
the present value of estimated future cash flows, discounted at the financial asset’s original effective interest rate. The carrying amount 
is reduced through use of an allowance account and the amount of the loss is recognised in profit or loss. EnQuest PLC  Annual Report and Accounts 2017

Notes to the Group Financial Statements CONTINUED
For the year ended 31 December 2017
Derivatives
Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value on the date a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently remeasured at their 
fair value. The method of recognising the resulting gain or loss depends on whether the derivative is designated as a hedging instrument.
The Group categorises derivatives as follows:
Fair value hedge
Changes in the fair value of derivatives that qualify as fair value hedging instruments are recorded in the profit or loss, together with any 
changes in the fair value of the hedged asset or liability. 
Cash flow hedge
The effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives that qualify as cash flow hedges are recognised in other comprehensive 
income. The gain or loss relating to the ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the profit or loss. Amounts accumulated in other 
comprehensive income are transferred to the profit or loss in the period when the hedged item will affect the profit or loss. When the 
hedged item no longer meets the requirements for hedge accounting, expires or is sold, any accumulated gain or loss recognised in 
other comprehensive income is transferred to profit and loss when the forecast transaction which was the subject of the hedge occurs.
Where put options are used as hedging instruments, only the intrinsic value of the option is designated as the hedge, with the change in 
time value recorded in finance costs within the income statement.
Derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting
When derivatives do not qualify for hedge accounting, changes in fair value are recognised immediately in the profit or loss within 
‘Remeasurements and exceptional items’ profit or loss on the face of the income statement. When a derivative reaches maturity, the 
realised gain or loss is included within the Group’s Business performance results with a corresponding reclassification from 
‘Remeasurements and exceptional items’.
Option premium
Option premium received or paid for commodity derivatives are amortised into Business performance revenue over the period between 
the inception of the option, and that option’s expiry date. This results in a corresponding reclassification from ‘Remeasurements and 
exceptional items’ revenue.
As noted above, where put options are designated as an effective hedge, the change in time value is recorded in finance costs. As the 
cost of a put option represents the initial time value of that option, option premium paid for put options which have been designated as 
effective hedges are amortised in Business performance finance costs, with an offsetting reclassification from ‘Remeasurements and 
exceptional items’ finance costs.
Trade receivables
Trade receivables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost less provision for impairment.
Financial liabilities
Financial liabilities within the scope of IAS 39 are classified as financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss or other financial 
liabilities at amortised cost. The Group determines the classification of its financial liabilities at initial recognition.
All liabilities are recognised initially at fair value net transaction costs, except in the case of financial liabilities recorded at fair value 
through profit or loss.
The Group’s financial liabilities include loans and borrowings, trade and other payables, quoted and unquoted financial instruments and 
derivative financial instruments.
Other financial liabilities, including borrowings, are initially measured at fair value, net of transaction costs. Other financial liabilities are 
subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, with interest expense recognised on an effective yield basis.
Interest bearing loans and borrowings
Interest bearing loans and borrowings are recognised initially at fair value, net of transaction costs incurred. Transaction costs are 
amortised over the life of the facility.
Borrowing costs are stated at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
The effective interest method is a method of calculating the amortised cost of a financial liability and of allocating interest expense over 
the relevant period. The effective interest rate is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash payments through the expected 
life of the financial liability, or a shorter period to the net carrying amount of the financial liability where appropriate. 
Bonds
Bonds are measured on an amortised cost basis.
Derecognition of financial assets and liabilities 
Financial assets
A financial asset (or, where applicable, a part of a financial asset) is derecognised where:
• The rights to receive cash flows from the asset have expired;
• The Group retains the right to receive cash flows from the asset, but has assumed an obligation to pay them in full without material 
delay to a third party under a ‘pass-through’ arrangement; or
• The Group has transferred its rights to receive cash flows from the asset and either (a) has transferred substantially all the risks and 
rewards of the asset, or (b) has neither transferred nor retained substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset, but has transferred 
control of the asset.

STATEMENTS
Financial liabilities
A financial liability is derecognised when the obligation under the liability is discharged, cancelled or expires.
If an existing financial liability is replaced by another from the same lender, on substantially different terms, or the terms of an existing 
liability are substantially modified, such an exchange or modification is treated as a derecognition of the original liability and the 
recognition of a new liability such that the difference in the respective carrying amounts, together with any costs or fees incurred, are 
recognised in profit or loss. IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement regards the terms of exchanged or modified 
debt as ‘substantially different’ if the net present value of the cash flows under the new terms (including any fees paid net of fees 
received) discounted at the original effective interest rate is at least 10.0% different from the discounted present value of the remaining 
cash flows of the original debt instrument. The Group also considers qualitative factors in assessing whether a modified financial liability 
is ‘substantially different’. Where the modification is substantially different, it accounts for this as an extinguishment of the original 
liability even though a quantitative analysis may indicate a less than 10.0% cash flow change.
Inventories
Inventories of consumable well supplies are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value, cost being determined on an average 
cost basis. Inventories of hydrocarbons are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Under/over-lift 
Under or over-lifted positions of hydrocarbons are valued at market prices prevailing at the balance sheet date. An under-lift of 
production from a field is included in current receivables and valued at the reporting date spot price or prevailing contract price.  
An over-lift of production from a field is included in current liabilities and valued at the reporting date spot price or prevailing contract 
price. Movements in under or over-lifted positions are accounted for through cost of sales.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents includes cash at bank, cash in hand, outstanding bank overdrafts and highly liquid interest bearing securities 
with original maturities of three months or less. 
Equity
Share capital
The balance classified as equity share capital includes the total net proceeds (both nominal value and share premium) on issue of 
registered share capital of the parent company. Share issue costs associated with the issuance of new equity are treated as a direct 
reduction of proceeds. 
Merger reserve
Merger reserve represents the difference between the market value of shares issued to effect business combinations less the nominal 
value of shares issued. The merger reserve in the Group financial statements also includes the consolidation adjustments that arise 
under the application of the pooling of interest method.
Cash flow hedge reserve
For cash flow hedges, the effective portion of the gain or loss on the hedging instrument is recognised directly as other comprehensive 
income in the cash flow hedge reserve. Upon settlement of the hedged item, the change in fair value is transferred to profit or loss.
Available-for-sale reserve
Gains and losses (with the exception of impairment losses) arising from changes in available-for-sale financial investments are 
recognised in the available-for-sale reserve until such time that the investment is disposed of, where it is reclassified to profit or loss.
Share-based payments reserve
Equity-settled share-based payment transactions are measured at the fair value of the services received, and the corresponding 
increase in equity is recorded directly at the fair value of the services received. The share-based payments reserve includes shares held 
within the Employee Benefit Trust.
Retained earnings
Retained earnings contain the accumulated results attributable to the shareholders of the parent company. 
Employee Benefit Trust
EnQuest PLC shares held by the Group are deducted from the share-based payments reserve and are recognised at cost. Consideration 
received for the sale of such shares is also recognised in equity, with any difference between the proceeds from the sale and the original 
cost being taken to reserves. No gain or loss is recognised in the statement of comprehensive income on the purchase, sale, issue or 
cancellation of equity shares.
Provisions 
Decommissioning
Provision for future decommissioning costs is made in full when the Group has an obligation: to dismantle and remove a facility or an 
item of plant; to restore the site on which it is located; and when a reasonable estimate of that liability can be made. The amount 
recognised is the present value of the estimated future expenditure. An amount equivalent to the discounted initial provision for 
decommissioning costs is capitalised and amortised over the life of the underlying asset on a unit of production basis over proven and 
probable reserves. Any change in the present value of the estimated expenditure is reflected as an adjustment to the provision and the 
oil and gas asset. 
The unwinding of the discount applied to future decommissioning provisions is included under finance costs in the statement of 
comprehensive income. EnQuest PLC  Annual Report and Accounts 2017
118
Notes to the Group Financial Statements CONTINUED
For the year ended 31 December 2017
Other
Provisions are recognised when: the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of past events; it is probable that an 
outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation; and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation.
Leases
The determination of whether an arrangement is or contains a lease is based on the substance of the arrangement at the inception date. 
The arrangement is assessed for whether fulfilment of the arrangement is dependent on the use of a specific asset or assets or the 
arrangement conveys a right to use the asset or assets, even if that right is not explicitly specified in an arrangement.
Finance leases that transfer substantially all the risks and benefits incidental to ownership of the leased item to the Group, are 
capitalised at the commencement of the lease at the fair value of the leased asset or, if lower, at the present value of the minimum lease 
payments. Lease payments are apportioned between finance charges and reduction of the lease liability so as to achieve a constant rate 
of interest on the remaining balance of the liability. Finance charges are recognised in finance costs in the income statement.
A leased asset is depreciated over the useful life of the asset. However, if there is no reasonable certainty that the Group will obtain 
ownership by the end of the lease term, the asset is depreciated over the shorter of the estimated useful life of the asset and the 
lease term.
Lease charter payment credits, arising from the non-performance of the leased asset, are recognised as an operating expense in the 
income statement for the period to which they relate. 
Operating lease payments are recognised as an operating expense in the income statement on a straight line basis over the lease term.
Revenue and other operating income
Revenue is recognised to the extent that it is probable economic benefits will flow to the Group and the revenue can be reliably measured. 
Oil and gas revenues comprise the Group’s share of sales from the processing or sale of hydrocarbons on an entitlement basis, when the 
significant risks and rewards of ownership have been passed to the buyer.
Tariff revenue is recognised in the period in which the services are provided at the agreed contract rates.
Rental income is accounted for on a straight line basis over the lease terms and is included in revenue in the income statement.
The Group uses various commodity derivative instruments to manage some of the risks arising from fluctuations in commodity prices. 
Such contracts include options, swaps and futures. Where these derivatives have been designated as cash flow hedges of underlying 
commodity price exposures, certain gains and losses attributable to these instruments are deferred in other comprehensive income and 
recognised in the income statement within revenue and other operating income when the underlying hedged transaction crystallises or 
is no longer expected to occur. 
All other commodity derivatives within the scope of IAS 39 are measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognised in the income 
statement within revenue and other operating income. Unrealised mark to market changes in the remeasurement of derivative contracts 
are initially included in exceptional items within profit or loss. When the derivative reaches maturity, the gain or loss is realised and 
recycled to be included within Business performance.
Remeasurements and exceptional items 
As permitted by IAS 1 (Revised): Presentation of Financial Statements, certain items are presented separately. The items that the Group 
separately presents as exceptional on the face of the statement of comprehensive income are those material items of income and 
expense which, because of the nature or expected infrequency of the events giving rise to them, merit separate presentation to allow 
shareholders to understand better the elements of financial performance in the year, so as to facilitate comparison with prior periods 
and to better assess trends in financial performance.
The following items are routinely classified as Remeasurements and exceptional items (‘exceptional’):
• Unrealised mark to market changes in the remeasurement of derivative contracts are included in exceptional profit or loss. This 
includes the recycling of realised amounts from exceptional items into Business performance income when a derivative instrument 
matures, together with the recycling of option premium amortisation from exceptional to Business performance as set out in the 
Derivatives policy previously;
• Impairments and write offs/write downs are deemed to be exceptional in nature. This includes impairments of tangible and 
intangible assets, and write offs/write downs of unsuccessful exploration. Other non-routine write offs/write downs, where deemed 
material, are also included in this category; and
• The depletion of a fair value uplift to property, plant and equipment that arose from the merger accounting applied at the time of 
EnQuest’s formation. 
Employee benefits
Short-term employee benefits
Short-term employee benefits such as salaries, social premiums and holiday pay, are expensed when incurred. 
Pension obligations
The Group’s pension obligations consist of defined contribution plans. A defined contribution plan is a pension plan under which the 
Group pays fixed contributions. The Group has no further payment obligations once the contributions have been paid. The amount 
charged to the statement of comprehensive income in respect of pension costs reflects the contributions payable in the year. 
Differences between contributions payable during the year and contributions actually paid are shown as either accrued liabilities or 
prepaid assets in the balance sheet.

STRATEGIC 
REPORT
CORPORATE 
GOVERNANCE
FINANCIAL 
STATEMENTS
Share-based payment transactions
Eligible employees (including Directors) of the Group receive remuneration in the form of share-based payment transactions, whereby 
employees render services in exchange for shares or rights over shares (equity-settled transactions) of EnQuest PLC.
Equity-settled transactions
The cost of equity-settled transactions with employees is measured by reference to the fair value at the date on which they are granted. 
Fair value is measured in reference to the scheme rules, as detailed in note 18. In valuing equity-settled transactions, no account is taken 
of any service or performance conditions, other than conditions linked to the price of the shares of EnQuest PLC (market conditions) or 
‘non-vesting’ conditions, if applicable. 
The cost of equity-settled transactions is recognised over the period in which the relevant employees become fully entitled to the award 
(the vesting period). The cumulative expense recognised for equity-settled transactions at each reporting date until the vesting date 
reflects the extent to which the vesting period has expired and the Group’s best estimate of the number of equity instruments that will 
ultimately vest. The statement of comprehensive income charge or credit for a period represents the movement in cumulative expense 
recognised as at the beginning and end of that period.
No expense is recognised for awards that do not ultimately vest, except for awards where vesting is conditional upon a market or non-vesting 
condition, which are treated as vesting irrespective of whether or not the market or non-vesting condition is satisfied, provided that all 
other performance conditions are satisfied. Equity awards cancelled are treated as vesting immediately on the date of cancellation, and any 
expense not previously recognised for the award at that date is recognised in the statement of comprehensive income.
Taxes
Income taxes
Current tax assets and liabilities are measured at the amount expected to be recovered from or paid to the taxation authorities, based 
on tax rates and laws that are enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is provided in full on temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying 
amounts in the Group financial statements. However, deferred tax is not accounted for if it arises from initial recognition of an asset or 
liability in a transaction other than a business combination that at the time of the transaction affects neither accounting nor taxable 
profit or loss. Deferred tax is measured on an undiscounted basis using tax rates (and laws) that have been enacted or substantively 
enacted by the balance sheet date and are expected to apply when the related deferred tax asset is realised or the deferred tax liability 
is settled. Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which 
the temporary differences can be utilised. 
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries, except where the Group 
is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the 
foreseeable future.
The carrying amount of deferred income tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are 
offset only if a legal right exists to offset current tax assets against current tax liabilities, the deferred income taxes relate to the same 
taxation authority and that authority permits the Group to make a single net payment.
Production taxes
In addition to corporate income taxes, the Group’s financial statements also include and disclose production taxes on net income 
determined from oil and gas production. 
Production tax relates to Petroleum Revenue Tax (‘PRT’) and is accounted for under IAS 12 Income Taxes since it has the characteristics 
of an income tax as it is imposed under Government authority and the amount payable is based on taxable profits of the relevant fields. 
Current and deferred PRT is provided on the same basis as described above for income taxes. 
Investment allowances
The UK taxation regime provides for a reduction in ring fence supplementary corporation tax where investments in new or existing UK 
assets qualify for a relief known as investment allowances. Investment allowances are only triggered when production from the field 
commences. The Group is eligible for a number of investment allowances which will materially reduce the level of future supplementary 
corporation taxation. Investment allowances are recognised as a reduction in the charge to taxation in the years claimed. EnQuest PLC  Annual Report and Accounts 2017

recognised in 2017. Refer to note 2 for further details on the Group’s accounting policies for derivatives and ‘Remeasurements and exceptional items’. 
(ii) Impairments and write offs includes an impairment of tangible oil and gas assets totalling $172.0 million (2016: impairment reversal of $147.9 million), together with 
a charge of $2.7 million in relation to inventory write downs, a $0.02 million impairment on the investment in Ascent Resources (2016: $0.05 million impairment) and 
a $0.2 million write back of previously impaired exploration costs (2016: $0.8 million impairment/write off). Further details on the tangible impairment are provided

(i) The Group’s restructuring was deemed to result in a substantial modification of the terms of the Group’s credit facility (see note 19). In accordance with IAS 39, the 
Group has accounted for this substantial modification as an extinguishment of the liability for the original credit facility and the recognition of a new liability for 
the revised credit facility. In 2016, this resulted in $15.0 million of unamortised costs associated with the previous credit facility being expensed on extinguishment. 
The costs of negotiating the modifications to the credit facility, totalling $11.1 million and a $12.0 million restructuring fee, payable to the credit facility lenders by 
March 2018, were expensed. In 2016, these comprised an aggregate of $38.1 million of debt restructuring costs.
(ii) The Group had an agreement to hire the Stena Spey drilling vessel. Based on the drilling forecasts for 2016, it was expected that the vessel would not be fully 
utilised over this period and therefore a provision was recognised for unavoidable contracted costs of $22.9 million. During the year ended 31 December 2016, 
following changes to the Group’s drilling schedule, the contracted days were utilised in full and the provision of $22.9 million was reversed in full. 
(iii) During the year ended 31 December 2016, the Group disposed of its interest in the Avalon prospect for cash proceeds of $1.5 million, resulting in a loss on 
disposal of $16.2 million (see note 12).
(iv) In 2016, Other primarily included a $3.4 million reversal of a provision for contingent consideration which was no longer required following the results of the Eagle 
well drilled during the year and a $1.3 million depreciation of the fair value uplift.
(v) The Finance Act 2016 enacted a change in the supplementary charge tax rate, reducing it from 20% to 10%, and a change to petroleum revenue tax rate, reducing 
it from 35% to 0%, both effective from 1 January 2016. The Finance Act 2016 also enacted a reduction in the mainstream corporation tax rate reducing it from 18% 
to 17% with effect from 1 April 2020. The impact of these changes in tax rates in 2016 was a tax charge of $29.5 million.
(vi) At the year ended 31 December 2016, the recovery of deferred tax assets was reviewed which has led to a recognition of previously impaired tax losses totalling 
$48.8 million. This write back reflects the increase in value of the Group’s assets following a partial recovery of oil prices. EnQuest PLC  Annual Report and Accounts 2017

(d) Tax losses 
The Group’s deferred tax assets at 31 December 2017 are recognised to the extent that taxable profits are expected to arise in the 
future against which tax losses and allowances in the UK can be utilised. In accordance with IAS 12 Income Taxes the Group assessed the 
recoverability of its deferred tax assets at 31 December 2017 with respect to ring fence tax losses and allowances. The impairment 
model used to assess the extent to which it is appropriate to recognise the Group’s UK tax losses as deferred tax assets was run, using 
an oil price assumption of Dated Brent forward curve in the years 2018 to 2021 followed by $70/bbl inflated at 2.0% per annum from 
2022. The results of the impairment model demonstrated that it was appropriate to recognise a deferred tax asset on $24.2 million  
(2016: $214.3 million recognised deferred tax asset) of the Group’s UK ring fence corporate tax losses at 31 December 2017 based on 
expected future profitability. The recognised loss amount results in a deferred tax credit of $9.7 million (2016: $85.7 million credit) for  
the year in respect of losses and allowances that were previously not recognised as a deferred tax asset.
The Group has unused UK mainstream corporation tax losses of $290.2 million (2016: $285.8 million) for which no deferred tax asset has 
been recognised at the balance sheet date due to uncertainty of recovery of these losses. 
The Group has unused overseas tax losses in Canada of approximately CAD$13.5 million (2016: CAD$13.4 million) for which no deferred 
tax asset has been recognised at the balance sheet date. The tax losses in Canada have expiry periods of 20 years, none of which expire 
in 2018, and which arose following the change in control of the Stratic group in 2010. 
The Group has unused Malaysian income tax losses of $5.2 million (2016: $3.1 million) arising in respect of the Tanjong Baram RSC for 
which no deferred tax asset has been recognised at the balance sheet date due to uncertainty of recovery of these losses.
No deferred tax has been provided on unremitted earnings of overseas subsidiaries, Finance Act 2009 exempted foreign dividends from 
the scope of UK corporation tax where certain conditions are satisfied.
(e) Change in legislation
Finance Act 2016 enacted a change in the mainstream corporation tax rate, reducing it from 18% to 17% with effect from 1 April 2020. 
The impact of the change in tax rate in 2016 was a tax charge of $0.7 million.
Finance Act 2016 also enacted a change in the supplementary charge tax rate, reducing it from 20% to 10% with effect from  
1 January 2016 and a change to the petroleum revenue tax rate, reducing it from 35% to 0% with effect from 1 January 2016.  
The impact of the change in tax rate in 2016 was a tax charge of $28.9 million.
Finance Act 2017 enacted legislation in relation to the restriction of corporate interest deductions from 1 April 2017 and the restriction 
of relief for mainstream corporate tax losses with effect from 1 April 2017. While these changes do not impact North Sea ring fence 
activities directly, they have an impact on the current year Group tax charge where North Sea ring fence losses are offset against 
mainstream corporate tax profits which would otherwise be exposed due to the operation of these new rules. The impact of these 
changes in the current year was a tax charge of $15.1 million.

Notes to the Group Financial Statements CONTINUED
For the year ended 31 December 2017
During 2017 the Group acquired a 25% interest in Magnus oil field and other interests (see note 29), resulting in an acquisition of assets 
at a value of $124.5 million allocated to property, plant and equipment.
During the year ended 31 December 2017, the Group’s lease from Armada Kraken PTE Limited (‘BUMI’) of the FPSO for the Kraken field 
commenced. The lease has been assessed as a finance lease, and a $772.0 million lease liability and lease asset were recognised in June 
2017. The liability was calculated based on the present value of the minimum lease payments at inception of the lease (see note 24).
During the year ended 31 December 2016, the Group acquired an additional 10.5% interest in the Kraken asset and an additional 15.15% 
interest in the West Don field, resulting in aggregate purchase consideration of $40.7 million allocated to property, plant and equipment 
(see note 29).
During the year ended 31 December 2016, a liability of $26.6 million was recognised for the carry payable for the Kraken field following 
the finalisation of a reserve determination (see note 22). The amount payable was dependent upon the dated Brent forward curve at the 
date of the reserve determination. Change in carry liabilities also includes a $0.2 million decrease in the liability (see note 20(f)) for 
Malaysian assets (2016: decrease of $0.5 million).

(ii) Northern North Sea includes Heather/Broom, Thistle/Deveron and the Dons fields. The impairments are attributable primarily to underlying natural declines in fields.
(iii) The amounts disclosed for Malaysia relate to the Tanjong Baram field. 
(iv) Recoverable amount has been determined on a fair value less costs of disposal basis (see note 11 for further details of methodology and assumptions used, and 
note 2 Critical Accounting Estimates and Judgements for information on significant estimates and judgements made in relation to impairments). The amounts 
disclosed above are in respect of assets where an impairment (or reversal) has been recorded. Assets which did not have any impairment or reversal are excluded 
from the amounts disclosed. 
The net book value at 31 December 2017 includes $71.1 million (2016: $1,536.6 million) of pre-development assets and development 
assets under construction which are not being depreciated. 
The amount of borrowing costs capitalised during the year ended 31 December 2017 was $42.3 million (2016: $55.3 million) and relates to 
the Kraken development project (2016: Kraken and Scolty/Crathes development projects). The weighted average rate used to determine 
the amount of borrowing costs eligible for capitalisation is 7.0% (2016: 6.2%).
The net book value of property, plant and equipment held under finance leases and hire purchase contracts at 31 December 2017 was 
$756.3 million (2016: $nil) of oil and gas assets.

Cost and net carrying amount
At 1 January and 31 December 189,317 189,317
The goodwill balance arose from the acquisition of Stratic and PEDL in 2010 and the Greater Kittiwake Area asset in 2014. 
Goodwill acquired through business combinations has been allocated to a single CGU, the UK Continental Shelf (‘UKCS’), and this is 
therefore the lowest level at which goodwill is reviewed. 
Impairment testing of oil and gas assets and goodwill 
In accordance with IAS 36: Impairment of Assets, goodwill and oil and gas assets have been reviewed for impairment at the year end. 
In assessing whether goodwill and oil and gas assets have been impaired, the carrying amount of the CGU for goodwill and at field level 
for oil and gas assets is compared with their recoverable amounts. 
The recoverable amounts of the CGU and fields have been determined on a fair value less costs to sell basis. Discounted cash flow 
models comprising asset-by-asset life of field projections using Level 3 inputs (based on IFRS 13 fair value hierarchy) have been used to 
determine the recoverable amounts. The cash flows have been modelled on a post-tax and post-decommissioning basis discounted at 
the Group’s post-tax weighted average cost of capital (‘WACC’) of 10.0% (2016: 10.0%). Risks specific to assets within the CGU are 
reflected within the cash flow forecasts.

Key assumptions used in calculations
The key assumptions required for the calculation of the recoverable amounts are:
• Oil prices;
• Currency exchange rates;
• Production volumes;
• Discount rates; and 
• Opex, capex and decommissioning costs. 
Oil prices are based on Dated Brent forward price curve for the first three years and thereafter at $70/bbl from 2021.
Production volumes are based on life of field production profiles for each asset within the CGU. The production volumes used in the 
calculations were taken from the report prepared by the Group’s independent reserve assessment experts.
Operating expenditure, capital expenditure and decommissioning costs are derived from the Group’s Business Plan adjusted for 
changes in timing based on the production model used for the assessment of proven and probable (‘2P’) reserves.
The discount rate reflects management’s estimate of the Group’s WACC. The WACC takes into account both debt and equity. The cost 
of equity is derived from the expected return on investment by the Group’s investors. The cost of debt is based on its interest bearing 
borrowings. Segment risk is incorporated by applying a beta factor based on publicly available market data. The post-tax discount rate 
applied to the Group’s post-tax cash flow projections was 10.0% (2016: 10.0%). Management considers this to be the best estimate of a 
market participant’s discount rate.
Sensitivity to changes in assumptions
The Group’s recoverable value of assets is highly sensitive, inter alia, to oil price achieved and production volumes. The recoverable 
amount of the CGU would be equal to the carrying amount of goodwill if either the oil price or production volumes (on a CGU weighted 
average basis) were to fall by 7% (2016: 9%) from the prices outlined above. Goodwill would need to be fully impaired if the oil price or 
production volumes (on a CGU weighted average basis) were to fall by 16% from the prices outlined above (2016: 13%). The above 
sensitivities have flexed revenues and tax cash flows, but operating costs and capital expenditures have been kept constant.

The Group also concluded on the unsuccessful exploration costs resulting in a write off of $3.1 million.
During the year ended 31 December 2016, the Group disposed of its interest in the Avalon prospect for $1.5 million, realising a loss on 
disposal of $16.2 million (see note 4). The additions in 2016 and the related change in decommissioning provision primarily related to the 
Eagle well which was drilled during 2016. EnQuest PLC  Annual Report and Accounts 2017

Trade receivables are non-interest bearing and are generally on 15 to 30 day terms. Trade receivables are reported net of any provisions 
for impairment. As at 31 December 2017, no impairment provision for trade receivables was necessary (2016: nil). 
Joint venture receivables relate to amounts billable to, or recoverable from, joint venture partners and were not impaired. Under-lift is 
valued at market prices prevailing at the balance sheet date. As at 31 December 2017 and 31 December 2016, no other receivables were 
determined to be impaired. 
The carrying value of the Group’s trade, joint venture and other receivables as stated above is considered to be a reasonable 
approximation to their fair value largely due to their short-term maturities.
16. Cash and cash equivalents
The carrying value of the Group’s cash and cash equivalents is considered to be a reasonable approximation to their fair value due to 
their short-term maturities. Included within the cash balance at 31 December 2017 is restricted cash of $3.5 million (2016: $6.6 million). 
$2.8 million of this relates to cash held in escrow in respect of the unwound acquisition of the Tunisian assets of PA Resources  
(2016: $6.0 million) and the remainder relates to cash collateral held to issue bank guarantees in Malaysia.
Cash and cash equivalents also include an amount of $3.9 million (2016: $9.4 million) held in a Malaysian bank account which can only be 
used to pay cash calls for the Tanjong Baram asset and amounts related to the Tanjong Baram project finance loan.
At 31 December 2017, $7.0 million was placed on short-term deposit in order to cash collateralise the Group’s letter of credit. EnQuest PLC  Annual Report and Accounts 2017

The share capital comprises only one class of Ordinary share. Each Ordinary share carries an equal voting right and right to a dividend.
On 21 November 2016, the Company completed a placing and open offer, pursuant to which 356,738,114 new Ordinary shares were 
issued at a price of £0.23 per share, generating gross aggregate proceeds of $101.6 million. 233,858,061 of the new shares issued 
resulted from existing shareholders taking up their entitlement under the open offer to acquire four new Ordinary shares for every nine 
Ordinary shares previously held. On 21 November 2016, 10,739,486 shares were acquired by the Employee Benefit Trust pursuant to the 
open offer.
At 31 December 2017, there were 56,023,671 shares held by the Employee Benefit Trust (2016: 33,563,282). On 18 October 2017, 
26,685,433 shares were issued to the Employee Benefit Trust with the remainder of the movement in the year due to shares used to 
satisfy awards made under the Company’s share-based incentive schemes. 
18. Share-based payment plans
On 18 March 2010, the Directors of the Company approved three share schemes for the benefit of Directors and employees, being a 
Deferred Bonus Share Plan, a Restricted Share Plan and a Performance Share Plan. A Sharesave Plan was approved in 2012. 
The share-based payment expense recognised for each scheme was as follows:
2017
$’000
2016
$’000
Deferred Bonus Share Plan 1,069 1,274

Performance Share Plan (68) 4,378
Sharesave Plan 230 93
Executive Director bonus awards 594 1,787
2,849 8,452
The fair value of awards is calculated at the ‘market value’, being the average middle market quotation of a share for the three 
immediately preceding dealing days as derived from the Daily Official List of the London Stock Exchange, provided such dealing days 
do not fall within any period when dealings in shares are prohibited because of any dealing restriction. The fair values of awards granted 
to employees during the year are based on the ‘market value’ on the date of grant, or date of invitation in respect to the Sharesave Plan. 
Deferred Bonus Share Plan (‘DBSP’)
Eligible employees are invited to participate in the DBSP scheme. Participants may be invited to elect or, in some cases, be required, to 
receive a proportion of any bonus in Ordinary shares of EnQuest (invested awards). Following such award, EnQuest will generally grant 
the participant an additional award over a number of shares bearing a specified ratio to the number of his or her invested shares 
(matching shares). The awards granted will vest 33% on the first anniversary of the date of grant, a further 33% after year two and the final 
34% on the third anniversary of the date of grant. Awards, both invested and matching, are forfeited if the employee leaves the Group 
before the awards vest.

(i) On 21 November 2016, at its discretion, the Company increased the number of shares receivable by participants in the DBSP by a factor of 1.09265387 so that the 
value of their rights under outstanding awards was not adversely affected by the open offer. This resulted in the grant of 263,790 additional share awards. The fair 
value of these awards of $0.1 million is being expensed over the remaining vesting period of the original awards to which they relate.  EnQuest PLC  Annual Report and Accounts 2017

Notes to the Group Financial Statements CONTINUED
For the year ended 31 December 2017
The weighted average contractual life for the share awards outstanding as at 31 December 2017 was 0.9 years (2016: 1.0 years).
Restricted Share Plan (‘RSP’)
Under the RSP scheme, employees are granted shares in EnQuest over a discretionary vesting period at the discretion of the 
Remuneration Committee of the Board of Directors of EnQuest, which may or may not be subject to the satisfaction of performance 
conditions. Awards made under the RSP will vest over periods between one and four years. At present, there are no performance 
conditions applying to this scheme nor is there currently any intention to introduce them in the future.

fair value of these awards of $0.4 million is being expensed over the remaining vesting period of the original awards to which they relate.
The weighted average contractual life for the share awards outstanding as at 31 December 2017 was 4.8 years (2016: 5.6 years).
Performance Share Plan (‘PSP’)
Under the PSP, the shares vest subject to performance conditions. The PSP share awards granted during the year had four sets of 
performance conditions associated with them: 30% of the award relates to Total Shareholder Return (‘TSR’) against a number of 
comparator group oil and gas companies listed on the FTSE 350, AIM Top 100 and Stockholm NASDAQ OMX; 30% relates to reduction 
in net debt; 30% relates to production growth per share; and 10% relates to new 2P reserve additions over the three year performance 
period. Awards will vest on the third anniversary.
The fair values of PSP awards granted to employees during the year, based on the defined market value on the date of grant and which 
allow for the effect of the TSR condition which is a market-based performance condition, are set out below:

Sharesave Plan
The Group operates an approved savings related share option scheme. The plan is based on eligible employees being granted options 
and their agreement to opening a sharesave account with a nominated savings carrier and to save over a specified period, either three

Credit facility
In October 2013, the Group entered into a six-year $1.7 billion multi-currency revolving credit facility (the ‘RCF’), comprising of a 
committed amount of $1.2 billion (subject to the level of reserves) with a further $500 million available through an accordion structure. 
Interest on the revolving credit facility was payable at LIBOR plus a margin of 2.50% to 4.25%, dependent on specified covenant ratios.
On 21 November 2016, pursuant to the Restructuring the Group entered into an amended and restated credit agreement, which 
included the following terms:
• Commitments split into a term facility of $1.125 billion and a revolving facility of $75 million (together the ‘Credit Facility’);
• Maturity date extended to October 2021;
• Amortisation profile amended, with 1 April 2018 the first scheduled amortisation date;
• Borrowings subject to mandatory repayment out of excess cash flow (excluding amounts required for approved capital expenditure), 
assessed on a six monthly basis;
• Borrowings up to $890.7 million subject to interest at LIBOR plus a margin of 4.75%, paid in cash;
• Borrowings in excess of $890.7 million subject to interest at LIBOR plus a margin of 5.25%, paid in cash, with a further 3.75% interest 
accrued and added to the Payment In Kind (‘PIK’) amount at maturity of each loan’s maturity period;
• PIK amount repayable at maturity and subject to 9.0% interest, which is capitalised and added to the PIK amount on each 30 June and 
31 December;
• Accordion feature cancelled; and
• $12 million waiver fee payable to lenders on 31 March 2018.
The Group concluded that the above amendments to the RCF are a substantial modification, resulting in the previous loan carrying 
amount of $1,002.3 million ($1,017.3 million principal less unamortised issuance costs of $15.0 million) being derecognised and a new loan 
of $1,017.3 million being recognised at fair value. The difference of $15.0 million, which equated to the unamortised fees of the previous 
loan, was recognised as loss on extinguishment (see 2016 debt restructuring costs, note 4). The $12 million waiver fee along with  
$11.1 million of advisors’ fees were directly attributable to the modification of the RCF and were also expensed as part of the loss on 
extinguishment (see note 4).
At 31 December 2017, the carrying amount of the Credit Facility on the balance sheet was $1,100.0 million, comprising the loan principal 
drawn down of $1,095.2 million, plus $4.8 million of interest capitalised to the PIK amount (2016: $1,037.5 million, being loan principal 
drawn down of $1,037.3 million plus $0.2 million of interest capitalised to the PIK amount).
At 31 December 2017, after allowing for letter of credit utilisation of $7.0 million, $97.8 million remained available for drawdown under the 
Credit Facility (2016: $6.4 million and $156.3 million respectively).
During November 2017, the Group agreed additional amendments to its Term Loan and Revolving Credit Facility. These changes include 
the deferral of the scheduled $140 million reduction in the Term Loan facility from 1 April 2018 to 1 October 2018. A single amortisation 
of the RCF is due of $270 million in October 2018. 
Crude oil prepayment transaction
On 25 October 2017, the Group entered into an $80 million crude oil prepayment (‘Prepay’) with Mercuria Energy Trading SA. 
Repayment will be made in equal monthly instalments over 18 months, through the delivery of an aggregate of approximately  
1.8 mmbbls of oil. EnQuest will receive the average Brent price over each month subject to a floor of $45/bbl and a cap of approximately 
$64/bbl. Interest on the Prepay is payable at one month USD LIBOR plus a margin of 7.0%. The prepayment transaction is being 
undertaken on an unsecured basis.
At 31 December 2017, the carrying amount of the Prepay on the balance sheet was $75.6 million, comprising of the initial draw down of 
$80.0 million, less the repayment of $4.4 million of the principal. $0.3 million of interest is accrued on the balance sheet. 
SVT working capital facility
On 1 December 2017, EnQuest NNS Limited entered into a £42 million revolving loan facility with a joint operator partner to fund the 
short-term working capital cash requirements on the acquisition of SVT and other interests (see note 29). The facility is able to be drawn 
down against in instalments and accrues interest at 1.0% per annum plus GBP LIBOR. The facility is repayable three years from the initial 
availability of the facility. EnQuest PLC  Annual Report and Accounts 2017

In October 2016, the Group borrowed $40 million under a loan facility with a trade creditor to fund the settlement of deferred amounts 
for the Kraken project. The loan, together with accrued interest at a rate of 7.0% per annum, is repayable in instalments from 2018.  
A bonus of up to $1.7 million was payable at 31 December 2017 if the oil price was above $75/bbl in any period of 180 consecutive days 
between 1 October 2016 and 31 December 2017. At 31 December 2017, no bonus payment had been made or was due to be paid.

High yield bond
In April 2014, the Group issued a $650 million high yield bond with an originally scheduled maturity of 15 April 2022 and paying a 7.0% 
coupon semi-annually in April and October.
On 21 November 2016, the high yield bond was amended pursuant to a scheme of arrangement whereby all existing notes were 
exchanged for new notes. The new high yield notes continue to accrue a fixed coupon of 7.0% payable semi-annually in arrears. The 
interest will only be payable in cash if the ‘Cash Payment Condition’ is satisfied, being the average of the Daily Brent Oil Prices during 
the period of six calendar months immediately preceding the ‘Cash Payment Condition Determination Date’ is equal to or above  
$65/bbl. The ‘Cash Payment Condition Determination Date’ is the date falling one calendar month prior to the relevant interest payment 
date. If the ‘Cash Payment Condition’ is not satisfied, interest will not be paid in cash but instead will be capitalised and satisfied through 
the issue of additional high yield Notes (‘Additional HY Notes’). $27.5 million of accrued, unpaid interest as at the restructuring date was 
capitalised and added to the principal amount of the new high yield notes issued pursuant to the scheme. The maturity of the new high 
yield notes was extended to 15 April 2022 and the Company has the option to extend the maturity date of the new high yield notes to 
15 April 2023. Further, the maturity date of the new high yield notes will be automatically extended to 15 October 2023 if the Credit 
Facility is not repaid or refinanced in full prior to 15 October 2020.
The amendments to the high yield bond were not deemed to be a substantial modification and therefore $5.0 million of advisors’ fees 
directly attributable to the modification of the high yield bond were adjusted against the carrying value of the bond and are being 
amortised over the bond’s remaining term.
The fair value of the high yield bond was estimated to be $519.9 million (2016: $488.0 million). The price quoted for the retail bond was 
used to estimate the fair value of the high yield bond on the basis that, since the restructuring, both bonds carry similar rights. 
Retail bond
In 2013, the Group issued a £155 million retail bond with an originally scheduled maturity of 15 February 2022 and paying a 5.5% coupon 
semi-annually in February and August. For the interest period commencing 15 August 2016, in accordance with the terms of the bond, 
the rate of interest increased to 7.0% following the determination of the Company’s leverage ratio at 31 December 2015.
On 21 November 2016, the retail bond was amended pursuant to a scheme of arrangement whereby all existing notes were exchanged 
for new notes. The new retail notes continue to accrue a fixed coupon of 7.0% payable semi-annually in arrears. The interest will only be 
payable in cash if the ‘Cash Payment Condition’ is satisfied, being the average of the Daily Brent Oil Prices during the period of six 
calendar months immediately preceding the ‘Cash Payment Condition Determination Date’ is equal to or above $65/bbl. The ‘Cash 
Payment Condition Determination Date’ is the date falling one calendar month prior to the relevant interest payment date. If the ‘Cash 
Payment Condition’ is not satisfied, interest will not be paid in cash but instead will be capitalised and satisfied through the issue of 
additional Retail Notes (‘Additional Retail Notes’). The maturity of the new retail notes was extended to 15 April 2022 and the Company 
has the option to extend the maturity date to 15 April 2023. Further, the maturity date of the new retail notes will be automatically 
extended to 15 October 2023 if the Credit Facility is not repaid or refinanced in full prior to 15 October 2020.
The amendments to the retail bond were not deemed to be a substantial modification and therefore $0.8 million of advisors’ fees 
directly attributable to the modification of the retail yield bond were adjusted against the carrying value of the bond and are being 
amortised over the bond’s remaining term.
The bond had a fair value of $161.6 million (2016: $138.7 million). The fair value of the retail bond has been determined by reference to the 
price available from the market on which the bond is traded. EnQuest PLC  Annual Report and Accounts 2017

(b) Commodity contracts
The Group uses put and call options and swap contracts to manage its exposure to the oil price. 
Oil price hedging
In October 2017, the Group entered into an 18-month collar structure for $80 million (see note 19). The collar includes 18 separate call 
options and 18 separate put options, subject to a floor of $45/bbl and a cap of approximately $64/bbl. During 2017, losses totalling 
$5.2 million were recognised within unrealised revenue in the income statement.
The Group has not entered into any other put options within 2017. All put options entered into in 2016 matured within the year ended 
31 December 2016. In 2016, gains of $193.2 million were included in realised revenue in the income statement in respect of these 
matured options and $2.5 million of gains deferred in the prior year on the early close-out of effective hedges were recognised in 
realised revenue. Mark to market losses on the time value element of the put options in 2016 totalling $5.4 million was recognised in 
finance costs. Of this amount, $36.5 million was recognised within the Group’s Business performance results as it relates to the 
amortisation of the option premium paid, over the life of the option. The balance of the mark to market losses were recognised as an 
exceptional credit/charge in line with the Group’s accounting policy.
Gains totalling $43.9 million were realised during 2016 in respect to fixed price oil swap contracts. These contracts were for 2 million 
barrels of 2016 production with a fixed price of $66.6/bbl and were designated as effective hedges at 31 December 2015. An unrealised 
gain of $5.8 million was recognised as an exceptional item in the income statement.
Commodity derivative contracts at fair value through profit or loss (‘FVTPL’)
Commodity derivative contracts are designated as at FVTPL, and gains and losses on these contracts are recognised as a component of 
revenue. These contracts typically include bought and sold call options, bought put options and commodity swap contracts. 
For the year ended 31 December 2017, losses totalling $28.3 million (2016: losses of $35.3 million) were recognised in respect of commodity 
contracts designated as FVTPL. This included losses totalling $20.6 million (2016: gains of $16.2 million) realised on contracts that matured 
during the year, and mark to market losses totalling $7.7 million (2016: losses of $51.5 million). Of the realised amounts recognised during the 
year, $10.4 million (2016: $31.2 million) was realised in Business performance revenue in respect of the amortisation of premium income 
received on sale of these options. The premiums received are amortised into Business performance revenue over the life of the option. 
The mark to market of the Group’s open contracts as at 31 December 2017 was a loss of $29.2 million in respect of fixed price swap 
contracts for 4,150,000 barrels of 2018 production at a weighted average price of $59.1/bbl (2016: $40.5 million in respect of fixed price 
swap contracts for 5,998,000 barrels of 2017 production at a weighted average price of $51.3/bbl). The mark to market position on the 
Group’s other commodity derivative contracts (including contracts to purchase crude oil for trading purposes which are accounted for 
as a derivative), was $nil (2016: asset of $8.9 million). 
(c) Foreign currency contracts
The Group enters into a variety of foreign currency contracts, including Sterling, Euros and Norwegian Kroner. During the year ended 
31 December 2017, these contracts resulted a realised gain of $0.4 million recognised in the income statement (2016: similar contracts 
resulted in a realised loss of $57.6 million and an unrealised gain of $7.7 million).
During 2017, the Group has continued to use an exchange structure to manage risk. The first exchange structure was entered into in 2016 
and allowed the counterparty to elect to sell £47.5 million to EnQuest at an exchange rate of $1.4:£1 or purchase 1.3 million barrels of oil 
at $58/bbl. This structure expired on 30 June 2017. The second exchange structure allowed the counterparty to elect to sell £66 million 
to EnQuest at an exchange rate of $1.2:£1 or purchase 1.5 million barrels of oil at $60/bbl. This structure expired on 31 December 2017. 
From the exchange structures in the year, $4.8 million was recognised within other foreign currency contracts within cost of sales and no 
costs within other operating income (2016: $9.3 million and $nil respectively).
(d) Interest rate swap
During the year ended 31 December 2015, the Group entered an interest rate swap which effectively swaps 50% of floating USD LIBOR 
rate interest on the Group’s Malaysian loan into a fixed rate of 1.035% until 2018. The swap, which is effective from a hedge accounting 
perspective, has a net asset fair value of $0.04 million (2016: $0.04 million). The impact recognised within finance expenses on the income 
statement was $0.02 million (2016: $0.06 million). EnQuest PLC  Annual Report and Accounts 2017

Other receivables
As part of the 2012 farm-out to the Kuwait Foreign Petroleum Exploration Company (‘KUFPEC’) of 35% of the Alma/Galia development, 
KUFPEC agreed to pay EnQuest a total of $23.3 million over a 36 month period after Alma/Galia is deemed to be fully operational. 
$7.1 million was received during the year ended 31 December 2017 and the remaining receivable, discounted to present value, had a 
carrying value of $7.1 million at 31 December 2017 (2016: $14.0 million). Unwinding of discount of $0.2 million is included within finance 
income for the year ended 31 December 2017 (2016: $0.4 million). 
In August 2016, EnQuest agreed with Armada Kraken PTE Ltd (‘BUMI’) that BUMI would refund $65 million (EnQuest’s share being 
$45.8 million) of a $100.0 million lease prepayment made in 2014 for the FPSO for the Kraken field. This refund is receivable during 2018 
and onwards. Included within other receivables at 31 December 2017 is an amount of $24.4 million representing the discounted value of 
EnQuest’s share of these repayments (2016: $43.5 million). A total of $20.1 million was collected during the period. Unwinding of discount 
of $1.6 million is included within finance costs in the twelve months ended 31 December 2017.
As part of the Magnus and other interests acquisition (see note 29), EnQuest entered into an option to undertake the decommissioning 
of Thistle. The financial asset of $16.1 million represents the difference between the $50 million cash that BP would transfer to EnQuest 
upon exercise of the option, and the net present value of the estimate cash outflow to settle the liability assumed.
In addition, the Group has an option to acquire the remaining 75% of the Magnus oil field and BP’s interest in the associated 
infrastructure for a value of $300 million. This option lapses in January 2019. In line with IAS 39, a discounted value of $22.3 million has 
been attributed to this option (see note 29).
Other receivables at 31 December 2016 also included $2.3 million representing the fair value of a convertible loan note from Ascent.  
This loan note was sold during the first half of 2017, realising a gain of $1.3 million.
Other liabilities
As part of the agreement to acquire an interest in the PM8/Seligi assets in Malaysia, the Group agreed to carry Petronas Carigali for its 
share of exploration or appraisal well commitments. The discounted value of $7.2 million has been disclosed as a financial liability  
(2016: $7.4 million). Unwinding of the discount of $0.2 million is included within finance expense for the year ended 31 December 2017 
(2016: $0.3 million).
In addition, included in other liabilities is an accrued ‘waiver fee’ of $12.0 million payable to the Credit Facility lenders in relation to the 
restructuring of the facility in November 2016 (see note 19). The amount is payable by March 2018. 
As part of the Magnus and other interests acquisition (see note 29), EnQuest agreed to pay additional consideration in relation to the 
management of the physical decommissioning costs of Thistle and Deveron. The financial liability of $4.2 million relates to the amount 
due to BP by reference to 7.5% of BP’s actual decommissioning costs on an after tax basis.

Fair value hierarchy
All financial instruments for which fair value is recognised or disclosed are categorised within the fair value hierarchy, based on the 
lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement as a whole, as follows:
Level 1: Quoted (unadjusted) market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities;
Level 2: Valuation techniques for which the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement is directly or indirectly 
observable;
Level 3: Valuation techniques for which the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement is unobservable.
For assets and liabilities that are recognised at fair value on a recurring basis, the Group determines whether transfers have occurred 
between levels in the hierarchy by re-assessing categorisation (based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value 
measurement as a whole) at the end of each reporting period. There have been no transfers between Level 1 and Level 2 during the 
period (2016: no transfers). 
For recurring and non-recurring fair value measurements categorised within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy, the Group uses the 
valuation processes to decide its valuation policies and procedures and analyse changes in fair value measurements from period to 
period. Level 3 financial instruments consist of interest bearing loans and borrowings (see note 19) and contingent consideration  
(see note 24), which are valued in accordance with the Group’s accounting policies.  EnQuest PLC  Annual Report and Accounts 2017

Decommissioning provision
The Group makes full provision for the future costs of decommissioning its production facilities and pipelines on a discounted basis. 
With respect to the Heather field, the decommissioning provision is based on the Group’s contractual obligation of 37.5% of the 
decommissioning liability rather than the Group’s equity interest in the field.
The Group’s total provision represents the present value of decommissioning costs which are expected to be incurred up to 2033 
assuming no further development of the Group’s assets. The liability is discounted at a rate of 2.0% (2016: 2.3%). The unwinding of the 
discount is classified as a finance cost (see note 6).
Acquisitions during the year ended 31 December 2016 reflect amounts associated with the additional interests in the Kraken and West 
Don fields acquired during the year which were $7.5 million and $7.6 million, respectively (see note 29).
These provisions have been created based on internal and third-party estimates. Assumptions based on the current economic 
environment have been made which management believe are a reasonable basis upon which to estimate the future liability. These 
estimates are reviewed regularly to take into account any material changes to the assumptions. However, actual decommissioning costs 
will ultimately depend upon future market prices for the necessary decommissioning works required, which will reflect market conditions 
at the relevant time. Furthermore, the timing of decommissioning liabilities is likely to depend on the dates when the fields cease to be 
economically viable. This in turn depends on future oil prices, which are inherently uncertain.
The Group enters into surety bonds principally to provide security for its decommissioning obligations. The surety bond facilities  
which expired in December 2017 were renewed for 12 months, subject to on-going compliance with the terms of the Group’s 
borrowings. At 31 December 2017, the Group held surety bonds totalling $129.6 million (2016: $118.5 million).
Carry provision
Consideration for the acquisition of 40% of the Kraken field from Cairn (previously Nautical) and First Oil PLC (‘First Oil’) in 2012 was 
through development carries. The ‘contingent’ carry is dependent upon a reserves determination which took place in Q2 2016.  
During 2017, $5.5 million of the carry had been paid, with no remaining liability recognised on the balance sheet as at 31 December 2017 
(2016: $21.1 million paid and $5.5 million remaining). 
Cost recovery provision
As part of the KUFPEC farm-in agreement, a cost recovery protection mechanism was agreed with KUFPEC to enable KUFPEC to recoup 
its investment to the date of first production. If on 1 January 2017, KUFPEC’s costs to first production had not been recovered or deemed 
to have been recovered, EnQuest would pay KUFPEC an additional 20% share of net revenue. This additional revenue is to be paid until 
the capital costs to first production have been recovered.  EnQuest PLC  Annual Report and Accounts 2017

STRATEGIC 
REPORT
CORPORATE 
GOVERNANCE
FINANCIAL 
STATEMENTS
A provision has been made for the expected payments that the Group will make to KUFPEC. The assumptions made in arriving at the 
projected cash payments are consistent with the assumptions used in the Group’s 2017 year end impairment test, and the resulting cash 
flows were included in the determination of the recoverable value of the project. In establishing when KUFPEC has recovered its capital 
cost to first oil, the farm-in agreement requires the use of the higher of the actual oil price, or $90/bbl real, inflated at 2.0% per annum 
from 2012. These cash flows have been discounted at a rate of 2.0% (2016: 2.3%).
During 2017, the Group entered into discussions with Petronas in relation to the prior period PM8 cost recovery at the PM8 concession. 
A provision has been made for the expected payments that the Group will make as part of the settlement agreement. The provision is 
expected to be paid in two parts during 2018 and 2019, as disclosed within current and non-current provisions. At 31 December 2017, the 
provision was $10.3 million.
Contingent consideration
As part of the purchase agreement with the previous owner of the GKA assets, a contingent consideration was agreed based on  
Scolty/Crathes field development plan (‘FDP’) approval and ‘first oil’. EnQuest paid $3.0 million in November 2015, following FDP 
approval in October 2015, and $9.0 million during 2017. $8.0 million is due on the later of one year after first oil or 30 January 2018. In 
addition, further payments will become due if the oil price rises above $75/bbl on a linear basis up to $100/bbl, with a cap on total 
payments of $20.0 million. The cash flows have been discounted using a 2.0% discount rate (2016: 3.0%). An option model has been used 
to value the element of the consideration that is contingent on the oil price and has resulted in a credit to the income statement of  
$0.4 million for the year ended 31 December 2017 (2016: $0.7 million). The carrying value of the Scolty/Crathes contingent consideration 
at 31 December 2017 is $8.1 million (31 December 2016: $17.3 million).
In addition, there is consideration due subject to future exploration success which, having been reassessed for the year ended 
31 December 2017, continues to be held at $5.3 million.
On 1 December 2017 the acquisition of the Magnus oil field and other interests (see note 29) was funded through a vendor loan from BP, 
recognised as contingent consideration at a fair value of $66.6 million. The loan is repayable solely out of the cash flows which are 
achieved above operating cash flows from the Transaction assets and is secured over the interests in the Transaction assets. The loan 
accrues interest at a rate of 5.0% per annum on the base consideration. The fair value has been estimated by calculating the present 
value of the future expected cash flows, based on a discount rate of 10.0% and assumed repayment of around three years.
Surplus lease provision
In June 2015, the Group entered a 20-year lease in respect of the Group’s office building in Aberdeen, with part of the building 
subsequently being sub-let with a rent-free incentive. A provision has been recognised for the unavoidable costs in relation to the 
sub-let space. The provision has been discounted using a 2.0% (2016: 2.3%) discount rate. At 31 December 2017, the provision was 
$2.9 million (2016: $2.8 million).

Trade payables are normally non-interest bearing and settled on terms of between 10 and 30 days. The Group has arrangements with 
various suppliers to defer payment of a proportion of its capital spend. The majority of these deferred payments fall due in 2018 and the 
balance is expected to be fully settled in 2019.
Certain trade and other payables will be settled in currencies other than the reporting currency of the Group, mainly in Sterling.
Accrued expenses include accruals for capital and operating expenditure in relation to the oil and gas assets.
The carrying value of the Group’s trade and other payables as stated above is considered to be a reasonable approximation to their fair 
value largely due to the short-term maturities. EnQuest PLC  Annual Report and Accounts 2017

24. Commitments and contingencies
Commitments
(i) Operating lease commitments – lessee
The Group has financial commitments in respect of non-cancellable operating leases for office premises. These leases have remaining 
non-cancellable lease terms of between one and 20 years. The future minimum rental commitments under these non-cancellable leases 
are as follows:
2017
$’000

Due in more than five years 75,536 62,990
109,999 84,698
Lease payments recognised as an operating lease expense during the year amounted to $5.3 million (2016: $4.8 million). 
Under the Dons Northern Producer Agreement, a minimum notice period of 12 months exists whereby the Group expects the minimum 
commitment under this agreement to be approximately $7.1 million (2016: $9.4 million).
(ii) Operating lease commitments – lessor
The Group sub-leases part of its Aberdeen office. The future minimum rental commitments under these non-cancellable leases are 
as follows:
2017

Finance leases with an effective borrowing rate of 8.12% were entered into during the year (see note 10).
On 20 December 2013, the Group entered into a bareboat charter with BUMI for the lease of an FPSO vessel for the Kraken field.  
BUMI constructed the vessel and the Group made an initial prepayment of $100.0 million during 2014. In August 2016, it was agreed that 
$65.0 million of this prepayment would be refunded (see note 20(f)).
In June 2017, the Group’s lease of the FPSO commenced. The lease has been assessed as a finance lease, and a $772.0 million lease 
liability and lease asset were recognised in June 2017. The liability was calculated based on the present value of the minimum lease 
payments at inception of the lease. The lease liability is carried at $797.9 million as at 31 December 2017, of which $118.0 million is 
classified as a current liability. Finance lease interest of $31.3 million has been recognised within finance costs.
(iv) Capital commitments
At 31 December 2017, the Group had capital commitments excluding the above lease commitments amounting to $33.8 million (2016: 
$267.3 million). 
Contingencies
The Group becomes involved from time to time in various claims and lawsuits arising in the ordinary course of its business. Other than as 
discussed below, the Company is not, nor has been during the past 12 months, involved in any governmental, legal or arbitration 
proceedings which, either individually or in the aggregate, have had, or are expected to have, a material adverse effect on the 
Company’s and/or the Group’s financial position or profitability, nor, so far as the Company is aware, are any such proceedings pending 
or threatened.  EnQuest PLC  Annual Report and Accounts 2017

STRATEGIC 
REPORT
CORPORATE

FINANCIAL 
STATEMENTS
The Group is currently engaged in a dispute with KUFPEC, the Group’s field partner in respect of Alma/Galia. KUFPEC has commenced a 
court action in the High Court of Justice claiming an alleged breach of one of the Group’s warranties provided under the Alma/Galia 
Farm-in Agreement and seeking damages of $91.0 million (the maximum breach of warranty claim permitted under the Alma/Galia 
Farm-in Agreement), together with interest. The court proceedings are on-going and the Directors believe that a considerable period 
will elapse before a final decision is reached by the courts. 
The Directors consider the merits of the claim to be poor and the Group is defending itself vigorously. The Group has not made any 
provisions in respect of this claim as the Directors believe the claim is unlikely to be successful; and in any event the Directors believe the 
chances of an outcome exposing the Group to material damages are remote. There can, however, be no assurances that this claim will 
not ultimately be successful, or that the Group would not otherwise seek to enter into a settlement or compromise in respect of this 
claim, or that in the event of any such circumstances the Group would not incur costs and expenses in excess of its estimates.
The Group is also currently engaged in discussions with EMAS, one of the Group’s contractors on Kraken who performed the installation 
of a buoy and mooring system, in relation to the payment of approximately $15.0 million of variation claims which EMAS claims is due as 
a result of soil conditions at the work site being materially different from those reasonably expected to be encountered based on soil 
data previously provided. The Group is confident that such variation claims are not valid and that accordingly such amount is not due 
and payable by the Group under the terms of the contract with EMAS. The parties are currently in discussions pursuant to the dispute 
resolution process under the contract.
There are a number of contractual matters not agreed between the Group and BUMI relating to the charter of the FPSO on the Kraken 
field. The Group considers that these matters will not adversely impact its payment obligations in relation to the charter.
25. Related party transactions
The Group financial statements include the financial statements of EnQuest PLC and its subsidiaries. A list of the Group’s principal 
subsidiaries is contained in note 28 to these Group financial statements.
Balances and transactions between the Company and its subsidiaries, which are related parties, have been eliminated on consolidation 
and are not disclosed in this note. 
All sales to and purchases from related parties are made at normal market prices and the pricing policies and terms of these transactions 
are approved by the Group’s management. With the exception of the transactions disclosed below, there have been no transactions 
with related parties who are not members of the Group during the year ended 31 December 2017 (2016: none).
Share subscription
In 2016, subscription for new Ordinary shares pursuant to the placing and open offer (see note 17) at the issue price of £0.23 per share:
• Double A Limited (‘Double A’), a company beneficially owned by the extended family of Amjad Bseisu, took up its entitlement in the 
open offer, subscribing for 31,735,702 shares;
• Directors and key management personnel took up their entitlement in the open offer, subscribing for 423,540 new Ordinary shares;
• Key management personnel participated in the placing, subscribing for 412,608 new Ordinary shares; and
• Close family members of Amjad Bseisu and their associated undertakings participated in the placing, subscribing for 2,940,304 
shares.
Commission related to the placing 
Double A made a commitment to subscribe for up to 91,224,079 new Ordinary shares under the placing (subject to clawback to satisfy valid 
applications under the open offer). In consideration of Double A’s commitment, the Company agreed to pay Double A commission equal 
to 1% of the product of (i) the number of new Ordinary shares which are subsequently clawed back following completion of the open offer 
and (ii) the issue price (the ‘Commission’). The Commission is consistent with those paid in respect of other participants in the placing.  
The Commission of $0.2 million due to Double A was outstanding as at 31 December 2016 and settled subsequently during 2017.
Office sublease
During the year ended 31 December 2017, the Group recognised $0.1 million of rental income in respect of an office sublease 
arrangement with Levendi Investment Management, a company where 72% of the issued share capital is held by Amjad Bseisu  
(2016: $0.1 million rental income from AA Capital Analysts Limited, a company whose majority controlling shareholder is Double  
A Limited).
Contracted services
During the year ended 31 December 2017, the Group obtained contracting services from Influit UK Production Solutions for a value of 
US$0.04 million. Amjad Bseisu has an indirect interest in Influit UK Production Solutions.

26. Risk management and financial instruments
Risk management objectives and policies
The Group’s principal financial assets and liabilities comprise trade and other receivables, cash and short-term deposits, interest bearing 
loans, borrowings and finance leases, derivative financial instruments and trade and other payables. The main purpose of these financial 
instruments is to manage short-term cash flow and raise finance for the Group’s capital expenditure programme.
The Group’s activities expose it to various financial risks particularly associated with fluctuations in oil price, foreign currency risk, 
liquidity risk and credit risk. Management reviews and agrees policies for managing each of these risks, which are summarised below. 
Also presented below is a sensitivity analysis to indicate sensitivity to changes in market variables on the Group’s financial instruments 
and to show the impact on profit and shareholders’ equity, where applicable. The sensitivity has been prepared for periods ended 
31 December 2017 and 2016, using the amounts of debt and other financial assets and liabilities held at those reporting dates.
Commodity price risk – oil prices
The Group is exposed to the impact of changes in Brent oil prices on its revenues and profits generated from sales of crude oil. 
The Group’s policy is to have the ability to hedge oil prices up to a maximum of 75% of the next 12 months production on a rolling 
annual basis, up to 60% in the following 12 month period and 50% in the subsequent 12 month period.
Details of the commodity derivative contracts entered into during and on hand at the end of 2017 are disclosed in note 20.
The following table summarises the impact on the Group’s pre-tax profit and total equity of a reasonably possible change in the 
Brent oil price, on the fair value of derivative financial instruments (primarily fixed price swaps over a total of 5.5 million barrels as at 
31 December 2017), with all other variables held constant. As the derivatives on hand at 31 December 2017 have not been designated as 
hedges, there is no impact on equity.

Foreign currency risk
The Group is exposed to foreign current risk arising from movements in currency exchange rates. Such exposure arises from sales or 
purchases in currencies other than the Group’s functional currency (US Dollars) and the bond which is denominated in Sterling.  
To mitigate the risks of large fluctuations in the currency markets, the hedging policy agreed by the Board allows for up to 70% of the 
non-US Dollar portion of the Group’s annual capital budget and operating expenditure to be hedged. For specific contracted capital 
expenditure projects, up to 100% can be hedged. Approximately 2% (2016: 1%) of the Group’s sales and 83% (2016: 81%) of costs 
(including capital expenditure) are denominated in currencies other than the functional currency.
At 31 December 2016, the Group had a forward foreign currency contract in place for NOK37.1 with a strike price of NOK8.61/£1 which 
matured in Q1 2017 as a result of the exchange structure entered into in June 2016 (see note 20). As at 31 December 2017, all exchange 
structures have matured (see note 20).
The Group also enters into foreign currency swap contracts from time to time to manage short-term exposures.
The following table summarises the sensitivity to a reasonably possible change in the US Dollar to Sterling foreign exchange rate, with all 
other variables held constant, of the Group’s profit before tax due to changes in the carrying value of monetary assets and liabilities at 
the reporting date. The impact in equity is the same as the impact on profit before tax. The Group’s exposure to foreign currency 
changes for all other currencies is not material:

Credit risk
Credit risk is managed on a Group basis. Credit risk in financial instruments arises from cash and cash equivalents and derivative 
financial instruments where the Group’s exposure arises from default of the counterparty, with a maximum exposure equal to the 
carrying amount of these instruments (see maturity table within liquidity risks in note 26). For banks and financial institutions, only those 
rated with an A-/A3 credit rating or better are accepted. Cash balances can be invested in short-term bank deposits and AAA-rated 
liquidity funds, subject to Board approved limits and with a view to minimising counterparty credit risks.
In addition, there are credit risks of commercial counterparties including exposures in respect of outstanding receivables. The Group 
trades only with recognised international oil and gas operators and at 31 December 2017 there were $23.6 million of trade receivables 
past due (2016: $5.6 million), $1.7 million of joint venture receivables past due (2016: $8.6 million) and $nil (2016: $nil) of other receivables 
past due but not impaired. Subsequent to year end, $1.5 million of these outstanding balances have been collected (2016: $10.9 million). 
Receivable balances are monitored on an ongoing basis with appropriate follow-up action taken where necessary.

At 31 December 2017, the Group had four customers accounting for 84% of outstanding trade receivables (2016: three customers, 90%) 
and three joint venture partners accounting for 97% of joint venture receivables (2016: five joint venture partners, 90%).
Liquidity risk
The Group monitors its risk to a shortage of funds by reviewing its cash flow requirements on a regular basis relative to its existing bank 
facilities and the maturity profile of its borrowings. Specifically the Group’s policy is to ensure that sufficient liquidity or committed 
facilities exist within the Group to meet its operational funding requirements and to ensure the Group can service its debt and adhere to 
its financial covenants. 
On 21 November 2016, the Company concluded a comprehensive financial restructuring comprising: amendments to the credit facility, 
high yield bond and retail bond; renewal of surety bond facilities; and a placing and open offer (the ‘Restructuring’). The terms of the 
Restructuring are set out further in notes 17 and 19. The Restructuring was designed to provide the Group with a stable and sustainable 
capital structure, reduced cash debt service obligations and greater liquidity. In particular, the Restructuring is expected to enable the 
Group to complete the Kraken and Scolty/Crathes developments. At 31 December 2017, $97.8 million (2016: $156.3 million) was available 
for draw down under the Group’s Credit Facility (see note 19). 
The following tables detail the maturity profiles of the Group’s non-derivative financial liabilities including projected interest thereon. 
The amounts in these tables are different from the balance sheet as the table is prepared on a contractual undiscounted cash flow basis 
and include future interest payments.

Capital management
The capital structure of the Group consists of debt, which includes the borrowings disclosed in note 19, cash and cash equivalents and 
equity attributable to the equity holders of the parent, comprising issued capital, reserves and retained earnings as in the Group 
statement of changes in equity.
The primary objective of the Group’s capital management is to optimise the return on investment, by managing its capital structure to 
achieve capital efficiency whilst also maintaining flexibility. The Group regularly monitors the capital requirements of the business over 
the short, medium and long-term, in order to enable it to foresee when additional capital will be required. On 21 November 2016, the 
Group completed a comprehensive package of financial restructuring measures (see notes 17 and 19 for further details).
The Group has approval from the Board to hedge foreign exchange risk on up to 70% of the non US Dollar portion of the Group’s annual 
capital budget and operating expenditure. For specific contracted capex projects, up to 100% can be hedged. In addition, there is 
approval from the Board to hedge up to 75% of annual production in year 1, 60% in year 2 and 50% in year 3. This is designed to reduce 
the risk of adverse movements in exchange rates and prices eroding the return on the Group’s projects and operations.
The Board regularly reassesses the existing dividend policy to ensure that shareholder value is maximised. Any future payment of 
dividends is expected to depend on the earnings and financial condition of the Company and such other factors as the Board 
considers appropriate.
The Group monitors capital using the gearing ratio and return on shareholders’ equity as follows:

29. Business combinations
Acquisition of Magnus and other interests
On 1 December 2017, EnQuest completed the acquisition from BP plc of an initial 25% interest in the Magnus oil field (‘Magnus’) as well 
as a 3.0% interest in the Sullom Voe Oil terminal and supply facility (‘SVT’), 9.0% of Northern Leg Gas Pipeline (‘NLGP’), and 3.8% of 
Ninian Pipeline System (‘NPS’) (collectively the ‘Transaction assets’). 
The transaction is in keeping with EnQuest’s strategy of maximising value from late life assets with significant remaining resource 
potential. The required regulatory, government authority, counterparty and partner consents have been obtained for the transaction. 
The transaction is an acquisition of an interest in a joint operation under IFRS 11 and, as the activity constitutes a business as defined in 
IFRS 3 Business Combination, the acquisition has been accounted for as a business combination. The consolidated financial statements 
include the fair values of the identifiable assets and liabilities as at the date of acquisition, and the results of the Transaction assets for 
the one month period from the acquisition date. 
The fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities of the Transaction assets as at the date of acquisition were:

(i) The financial asset relates to the Thistle decommissioning option, and represents the difference between the $50 million cash that BP would transfer to EnQuest 
upon exercise of the option, and the net present value of the estimated cash outflow to settle the liability assumed.
(ii) The financial liability relates to the amount due to BP by reference to 7.5% of BP’s actual decommissioning costs on an after-tax basis. The additional consideration 
EnQuest may pay is capped at the amount of cumulative positive cash flows received by EnQuest from the Transaction assets.
(iii) The financial asset relates to the purchase option to acquire the remaining 75% of Magnus oil field and BP’s interest in the associated infrastructure for a value of 
$300 million.
(iv) The initial accounting for the acquisition of the Transaction assets has only been provisionally determined at the end of the reporting period. At the date of 
finalisation of these financial statements, the necessary market valuations and other calculations had not been finalised and they have therefore only been 
provisionally determined based on the Directors’ best estimates. Thus, the fair value of the net asset may be subsequently adjusted, with a corresponding 
adjustment to goodwill prior to 1 December 2018 (one year after the transaction). 
In addition to the above identifiable assets and liabilities, under the terms of the agreement, the Group has an option to acquire the 
remaining 75% of the Magnus oil field and BP’s interest in the associated infrastructure for a value of $300 million. This option lapses in 
January 2019. In line with IAS 39, a discounted value of $22.3 million has been attributed to this option and recorded within other 
financial assets (see note 20). 
EnQuest also has the option to receive $50 million from BP in exchange for undertaking the management of the physical 
decommissioning activities for Thistle and Deveron and making payments by reference to 6.0% of the gross decommissioning costs of 
Thistle and Deveron fields (see note 20). In January 2018, the Group exercised part of the option (see note 27).
The excess of fair value of the net assets acquired over the purchase consideration has arisen primarily due to BP’s strategic decision to 
partner with EnQuest to extend the life of existing mature assets and from the Group’s ability to maximise the value from the late life 
assets with significant remaining resource potential. The gain has been immediately recognised through exceptionals in the statement 
of comprehensive income.
At the date of acquisition, the fair value of the net assets was $115.4 million. At 31 December 2017, none of the trade receivables have 
been impaired. EnQuest PLC  Annual Report and Accounts 2017

Fair value of consideration
The consideration payable has been satisfied via a vendor loan from BP . The loan is repayable solely out of the cash flows which are 
achieved above operating cash flows from the Transaction assets and is secured over the interests in the Transaction assets. The loan 
accrues interest at a rate of 5.0% per annum on the base consideration. The base consideration was $85 million, which was adjusted for 
interim period and working capital adjustments since the economic date of 1 January 2017, resulting in contingent consideration of 
$66.6 million. The present value of the contingent consideration was calculated from the future expected cash flows, at a discount rate of 
10.0% and assumed repayment of around three years. This is recognised within contingent consideration within provisions (see note 22). 
From the date of acquisition, the Transaction assets have contributed $14.0 million of revenue and $2.1 million to the profit before tax 
from continuing operations of the Group. If the combination had taken place at the beginning of the year, revenue from continuing 
operations would have been $73.9 million and the profit before tax from continuing operations would have been $25.9 million.  
In determining these amounts, management has assumed that the fair value adjustments, determined provisionally, that arose on the 
date of acquisition would have been the same if the acquisition had occurred on 1 January 2017. 
All transaction costs were paid by BP as part of the deal agreement.

Net identifiable assets 2,464 4,998 7,462
In February 2016, the Group acquired an additional 10.5% interest in the Kraken development asset from First Oil for nominal 
consideration, resulting in a revised working interest of 70.5% in this joint arrangement. The amounts recognised in respect of the 
identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed are set out in the table above.
In August 2016, the Group acquired an additional 15.15% interest in the West Don producing field from First Oil, resulting in a revised 
working interest of 78.6% in this joint arrangement. The amounts recognised in respect of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities 
assumed are set out in the table above. The consideration of $2.5 million, which was satisfied through a reduction of receivable balances, 
equalled the fair value of identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed and therefore no goodwill arose on the acquisition. EnQuest PLC  Annual Report and Accounts 2017

STATEMENTS
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Directors’ Report and the financial statements in accordance with applicable law 
and regulations.
Company law requires the Directors to prepare financial statements for each financial year. Under that law the Directors have elected to 
prepare the financial statements in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice (United Kingdom 
Accounting Standards and applicable law). Under Company law the Directors must not approve the financial statements unless they are 
satisfied that they give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Company and of the profit or loss of the Company for that period. 
In preparing the parent company financial statements the Directors are required to:
• Select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;
• Make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and prudent;
• State whether applicable UK Accounting Standards have been followed, subject to any material departures disclosed and explained 
in the financial statements; and
• Prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Company will continue 
in business. 
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain the Company’s 
transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the Company and enable them to ensure that the 
Company financial statements comply with the Companies Act 2006. They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the 
Company and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.

1. Corporate information
The separate parent company financial statements of EnQuest PLC (the ‘Company’) for the year ended 31 December 2017 were 
authorised for issue in accordance with a resolution of the Directors on 19 March 2018.
EnQuest PLC (‘EnQuest’ or the ‘Company’) is a limited liability company incorporated and registered in England and is the holding 
company for the Group of EnQuest subsidiaries (together the ‘Group’). 
2. Summary of significant accounting policies
Basis of preparation
These separate financial statements have been prepared in accordance with Financial Reporting Standard 101, ‘Reduced Disclosure 
Framework’ (‘FRS 101’) and the Companies Act 2006 (the ‘Act’). The Company meets the definition of a qualifying entity under FRS 100, 
‘Application of Financial Reporting Requirements’ as issued by the Financial Reporting Council. The Company has previously notified its 
shareholders in writing about, and they do not object to, the use of the disclosure exemptions used by the Company in these financial 
statements.
These financial statements are prepared under the historical cost basis, except for the fair value remeasurement of certain financial 
instruments, including derivatives, as set out in the accounting policies below. The functional and presentation currency of the separate 
financial statements is United States Dollars and all values in the separate financial statements are rounded to the nearest thousand 
($’000) except where otherwise stated.
As permitted by FRS 101, the Company has taken advantage of the disclosure exemptions available under that standard in relation to 
share-based payments, financial instruments, fair value measurement, capital management, presentation of comparative information in 
respect of certain assets, presentation of a cash flow statement, standards not yet effective, impairment of assets and related party 
transactions. Where relevant, equivalent disclosures have been given in the Group accounts.
The Directors have taken advantage of the exemption available under Section 408 of the Companies Act 2006 and not presented an 
income statement or a statement of comprehensive income for the parent company. The parent company’s accounts present 
information about it as an individual undertaking and not about its Group. The Company reported a loss for the financial year ended 
31 December 2017 of $77.0 million (2016: loss of $42.5 million). There were no other recognised gains or losses in the period (2016: nil).
Going concern 
The Directors’ assessment of going concern concludes that the use of the going concern basis is appropriate and, notwithstanding the 
material uncertainty as provided in the ‘Going Concern’ section of the Financial Review, the Directors have a reasonable expectation 
that the Group will be able to continue in operation and meet its commitments as they fall due over the going concern period. See the 
Financial Review for further details.
The accounting policies which follow set out those policies which apply in preparing the financial statements for the year ended 
31 December 2017.
Critical accounting estimates and judgements
The management of the Group has to make estimates and judgements when preparing the financial statements of the Group. 
Uncertainties in the estimates and judgements could have an impact on the carrying amount of assets and liabilities and the Group’s 
result. The most important estimates and judgements in relation thereto are:
Going concern
The going concern assumption is highly sensitive to economic conditions. The Company closely monitors and manages its funding 
position and liquidity risk throughout the year including monitoring forecast covenant results to ensure it has access to sufficient funds 
to meet forecast cash requirements. Cash forecasts are regularly produced and sensitivities considered for, but not limited to, changes 
in crude oil prices (adjusted for hedging undertaken by the Group), production rates and development project timing and costs. These 
forecasts and sensitivity analyses allow management to mitigate any liquidity or covenant compliance risks in a timely manner.
Impairment of investments in subsidiaries
Determination of whether investments have suffered any impairment requires an estimation of the assets recoverable value. The 
recoverable value is based on the discounted cash flows expected to arise from the subsidiaries oil and gas assets, using asset-by-asset 
life of field projections as part of the Group’s assessment for the impairment of the oil and gas assets. See Group critical accounting 
estimates and judgements.
Taxation
The tax provision is prepared before the tax return are filed with the tax authority and, significantly, before these have been agreed.  
As a result, the tax provision process necessarily involves the use of a number of estimates and judgements including those required in 
calculating the effective tax rate.
The Company recognises deferred tax assets on unused tax losses where it is probable that future taxable profits will be available for 
utilisation. This requires management to make judgements and assumptions regarding the amount of deferred tax that can be 
recognised, as well as the likelihood of future taxable profits. 
Foreign currencies
Transactions in currencies other than the Company’s functional currency are recorded at the prevailing rate of exchange on the date  
of the transaction. At the year end, monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rates of 
exchange prevailing at the balance sheet date. Non-monetary assets and liabilities that are measured at historical cost in a foreign 
currency are translated using the rate of exchange as at the dates of the initial transactions. Non-monetary assets and liabilities 
measured at fair value in a foreign currency are translated using the rate of exchange at the date the fair value was determined.  
All foreign exchange gains and losses are taken to the statement of comprehensive income.

FINANCIAL 
STATEMENTS
Financial assets
Financial assets within the scope of IAS 39 are classified as financial assets at fair value through profit or loss, loans and receivables, 
held-to-maturity investments, available-for-sale financial investments, or as derivatives designated as hedging instruments in an 
effective hedge, as appropriate. The Company determines the classification of its financial assets at initial recognition.
All assets are recognised initially at fair value plus transaction costs, except in the case of financial assets recorded at fair value through 
profit or loss.
Subsequent measurement of financial assets depends on their classification as described below:
Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL)
Financial assets are classified as at FVTPL when the financial asset is either held for trading or designated as at FVTPL. 
Financial assets at FVTPL are stated at fair value, with any gains or losses arising on remeasurement recognised immediately in the 
income statement.
Financial assets designated upon initial recognition at FVTPL are designated at their initial recognition date and only if the criteria under 
IAS 39 are satisfied.
Available-for-sale financial investments
Listed and unlisted shares held by the Group that are traded in an active market are classified as being available-for-sale and are stated 
at fair value. Gains and losses arising from changes in fair value are recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated in the 
available-for-sale reserve with the exception of impairment losses which are recognised directly in profit or loss. Where the investment is 
disposed of or is determined to be impaired, the cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in the available-for-sale reserve is 
reclassified to profit or loss. 
Loans and receivables 
These include trade receivables, loans and other receivables that have fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active 
market and are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, less any impairment. Interest income is recognised by 
applying the effective interest rate, except for short-term receivables when the recognition of interest would be immaterial.
Investments
Investments in subsidiaries are accounted for at cost less any provision for impairment.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents includes cash at bank, cash in hand, outstanding bank overdrafts and highly liquid interest bearing securities 
with original maturities of three months or less. 
Financial liabilities
Financial liabilities within the scope of IAS 39 are classified as financial assets at fair value through profit or loss or other financial 
liabilities at amortised cost. The Company determines the classification of its financial liabilities at initial recognition.
All liabilities are recognised initially at fair value net transaction costs, except in the case of financial liabilities recorded at fair value 
through profit or loss.
Interest bearing loans and borrowings
Interest bearing loans and borrowings are recognised initially at fair value, net of transaction costs incurred. Transaction costs are 
amortised over the life of the facility.
Borrowing costs are stated at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
The effective interest method is a method of calculating the amortised cost of a financial liability and of allocating interest expense over 
the relevant period. The effective interest rate is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash payments through the expected 
life of the financial liability, or a shorter period to the net carrying amount of the financial liability where appropriate. 
Bonds
Bonds are measured on an amortised cost basis. 
Income taxes
Current tax assets and liabilities are measured at the amount expected to be recovered from or paid to the taxation authorities, based 
on tax rates and laws that are enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is provided in full on temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying 
amounts in the Company financial statements. Deferred tax is measured on an undiscounted basis using tax rates (and laws) that have 
been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date and are expected to apply when the related deferred tax asset is 
realised or the deferred tax liability is settled. Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable 
profits will be available against which the temporary differences can be utilised. 
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries and interests in joint 
ventures, except where the Group is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary 
difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future. EnQuest PLC  Annual Report and Accounts 2017
156
Notes to the Financial Statements CONTINUED
For the year ended 31 December 2017
The carrying amount of deferred income tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are 
offset only if a legal right exists to offset current tax assets against current tax liabilities, the deferred income taxes relate to the same 
taxation authority and that authority permits the Company to make a single net payment.
Employee Benefit Trust
EnQuest PLC shares held by the Group are deducted from the share-based payments reserve and are recognised at cost. Consideration 
received for the sale of such shares is also recognised in equity, with any difference between the proceeds from the sale and the original 
cost being taken to reserves. No gain or loss is recognised in the profit and loss account on the purchase, sale, issue or cancellation of 
equity shares.
Share-based payment transactions
Employees (including Directors) of the Group receive remuneration in the form of share-based payment transactions, whereby 
employees render services in exchange for shares or rights over shares (equity-settled transactions) of EnQuest PLC.
Equity-settled transactions
The cost of equity-settled transactions with employees is measured by reference to the fair value at the date on which they are granted. 
In valuing equity-settled transactions, no account is taken of any service or performance conditions, other than conditions linked to the 
price of the shares of EnQuest (market conditions) or ‘non-vesting’ conditions, if applicable.
The cost of equity-settled transactions is recognised over the period in which the relevant employees become fully entitled to the award 
(the vesting period). The cumulative expense recognised for equity-settled transactions at each reporting date until the vesting date 
reflects the extent to which the vesting period has expired and the Group’s best estimate of the number of equity instruments that will 
ultimately vest. The profit and loss account charge or credit for a period represents the movement in cumulative expense recognised as 
at the beginning and end of that period.
No expense is recognised for awards that do not ultimately vest, except for awards where vesting is conditional upon market or 
non-vesting conditions, which are treated as vesting irrespective of whether or not the market or non-vesting condition is satisfied, 
provided that all other performance conditions are satisfied. Equity awards cancelled are treated as vesting immediately on the date of 
cancellation, and any expense not recognised for the award at that date is recognised in the profit and loss account. The Company 
operates a number of share award schemes on behalf of the employees of the Group which are described in detail within note 18 of the 
Group financial statements.
The reserve for the share-based payments is used to record the value of equity-settled share-based payments awarded to employees 
and transfers out of this reserve are made upon vesting of the original share awards.

of cessation of production on Heather/Broom (see note 10 of the Group financial statements).
Details of the Company’s subsidiaries at 31 December 2017 are provided in note 28 of the Group financial statements.

Resources plc, which is incorporated in Great Britain and registered in England and Wales. See note 13 of the Group financial statements 
for more detail on the impairment.

combinations less the nominal value of the shares issued where merger relief applies to the transaction. The reserve is adjusted for any 
write down in the value of the investment in the subsidiary.

balance of the shares held by the Company’s Employee Benefit Trust. Transfers out of this reserve are made upon vesting of the original 
share awards.
