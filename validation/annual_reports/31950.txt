STRATEGIC REPORT
2 Diurnal Group plc _ Annual Report 2017
Strategy for success
Diurnal aims to develop and commercialise products to address 
unmet patient needs in chronic endocrine (hormonal) diseases, 
typically where there is either no licensed medicine or where 
current treatment does not sufficiently improve patients’ health. 
Diurnal has identified a number of such needs within the field of 
endocrinology, which the Group believes represents a multi-billion 
Dollar combined market opportunity . Diurnal is able to gain valuable 
insights into the burden of living with these diseases through our 
interaction with physicians and patient groups. These discussions 
have helped, and continue to help, shape the Group’s development 
plans, such that we can deliver products that not only address 
important unmet needs and improve patients’ lives but also have 
a positive impact on healthcare budgets.
Investing for development and value creation
During the year, Diurnal continued to make significant clinical 
development progress with its late-stage pipeline products, as 
well as establishing commercial operations in anticipation of 
future product launches. Infacort
®
 and Chronocort
®
 are in 
late-stage clinical development targeting indications of cortisol 
deficiency: Infacort
®
 has completed a Phase III clinical trial and 
has been submitted for marketing authorisation in Europe, and 
Chronocort
®
 is currently undergoing a Phase III clinical trial 
for Europe. The Group has put in place strong commercial 
infrastructure in Europe to support the planned launch of 
Infacort
®
, for which the Group anticipates receiving market 
authorisation in Europe towards the end of 2017 , at which stage 
development costs will begin to be capitalised in accordance 
with International Accountancy Standards (IAS). The Group plans 
to leverage its investment in the commercial team through the 
timely introduction of Chronocort
®
 following completion of 
the ongoing European Phase III clinical trial and regulatory review, 
expected around the end of 2019. The Group also remains 
mindful of external growth opportunities and continues to 
assess endocrinology assets that fit within its disease focus. 
The US remains a key market for Diurnal and the Group intends 
to progress the Phase III development of both Infacort
®
 and 
Chronocort
®
 in this region during the new financial year, whilst 
assessing the optimal commercialisation strategy, in parallel.
As planned, the funds raised at the IPO have allowed the Group 
to continue to build its team, and we have been able to attract 
highly skilled individuals across the organisation. The agreement 
with Ashfield Healthcare, announced during the year, has facilitated 
a rapid and efficient build-out of our European commercial 
organisation without the need to undertake costly upfront 
investment in infrastructure in each of our key territories. I am 
pleased to see that the Ashfield team has integrated seamlessly 
with Diurnal staff and are rapidly implementing our launch plans.
Diurnal also continues to invest in its earlier-stage pipeline, with 
good progress being made with the Group’s oral native testosterone 
product, which entered human clinical trials during the year, 
as well as our programmes in Cushing’s Disease (cortisol excess) 
and hypothyroidism. 
Meeting milestones, building our future
Chairman’s statement
It is with great pleasure that I report on the 
significant progress Diurnal has made this 
financial year towards becoming a world-leading, 
endocrinology-focused specialty pharma 
company. Most notable is the delivery of key 
milestones towards first commercial revenues. 
Through this period of development, Diurnal has 
maintained its entrepreneurial and patient-centric 
approach, which has enabled the progression of a 
valuable portfolio of novel prospects and provides 
a solid platform for our future development. 3  Diurnal Group plc _ Annual Report 2017
Board changes and governance
Diurnal strengthened its Board during the year with the 
appointment of Richard Bungay as Chief Financial Officer. 
Richard’s extensive experience in corporate roles within the 
biotechnology and pharmaceutical sector, with a particular focus 
on financing, investor relations and business development, will be 
invaluable as the Group executes its ambitious development plans. 
As the Group continues its rapid development, the Board and 
senior management are focused on maintaining a strong system 
of internal controls and appropriate risk management systems, 
to ensure that the business is well controlled. The Group has made 
significant investments during the year to ensure that it maintains 
the highest standards of quality in its operations. The Board 
continues to monitor the potential effects of Brexit on the 
Group’s business and, in particular, any impact on the regulatory 
framework for pharmaceutical product development, approval 
and commercialisation as well as any trading impacts as we 
prepare to commercialise Infacort
®
 across Europe.
People and culture
I would like to thank our employees for their continued support and 
hard work in driving the Group’s progress towards commercialising 
its first products. Few companies in the UK have successfully 
taken their own product into a regulatory review and on to 
commercialisation: it is a testament to the Diurnal team that our 
key milestones have been met during a period of intense activity 
and change. I would also like to thank my fellow Board members 
for the progress made this year in overseeing a strategy that will 
ensure continued and sustainable growth from our pipeline. 
Finally, I would like to thank our shareholders for their continued 
support as Diurnal aims to make a real difference to patients without 
effective treatment options for chronic endocrine diseases. 
Peter Allen
Chairman
5 September 2017
Diurnal’s progress towards becoming a world-leading 
endocrinology-focused specialty pharma company has been 
characterised by a strong focus on capital efficiency, whilst 
making sure that high quality resources are available on a timely 
basis. Diurnal’s organisation reflects the need for different skills 
at different stages of the product development cycle and 
provides the ability to respond flexibly to business needs.
Key elements of Diurnal’s structure are:
 + A core internal team covering development, regulatory, 
manufacturing, supply chain and commercialisation, 
in addition to administration. 
 + Many of Diurnal’s team work virtually, giving the Group 
access to the best individuals worldwide regardless of location.
 + Trusted consultants and contractors bringing expertise 
to Diurnal’s development, manufacturing and 
commercialisation activities.
 + A network of contract organisations, providing robust support 
for critical business activities worldwide. Diurnal has had 
successful long-term relationships with many of its partners. 
One example of such a relationship is with Glatt GmbH, 
who manufacture Infacort
®
 and Chronocort
®
 products. 
Diurnal started working with Glatt in 2010, initially for the 
development of formulations then moving onto clinical 
trial product manufacture, scale up and, for Infacort
®
, 
progression to manufacture of commercial product 
at Glatt’s facility in Binzen, Germany.

CEO Q&A
Q&A
What is your vision for Diurnal?
In the long term, we aspire to be the company that physicians 
first think of when treating patients with a broad range of endocrine 
disorders. In the near term, we aim to become the pre-eminent 
company in the treatment of diseases of cortisol deficiency.
What are your lead pipeline programmes and 
what unmet medical needs are they addressing?
Our two lead programmes, Chronocort
®
 and Infacort
®
, both address 
diseases of deficiency in cortisol, a key hormone involved in 
maintaining health for life.
Chronocort
®
 is initially being developed for congenital adrenal 
hyperplasia (CAH), an inherited condition where patients are unable 
to produce cortisol, leading to a poor quality of life and lower life 
expectancy. Current treatments are unable to provide the correct 
amount of cortisol during the night, leading to a build-up of potent 
sex hormones, called androgens, which cause damage to the body . 
Chronocort
®
 is deigned to mimic the body’s natural – or diurnal 
– rhythm and hence control the level of these androgens. 
Infacort
®
 is being developed to treat children who lack cortisol 
– a condition known as adrenal insufficiency (AI). Despite the 
active ingredient of Infacort
®
 having been available for around 
60 years, there is surprisingly no approved paediatric product. 
Infacort
®
 is designed to provide an accurate and appropriate 
dose of this life-saving medicine in a child-friendly formulation.
How big are the markets that these 
programmes are addressing?
We estimate that there are over 60,000 patients suffering from 
CAH across the US and Europe, which we believe translates to 
a total potential market of over $400m. The paediatric AI market, 
which we will address with Infacort
®
, is around 4,000 patients in 
Europe and a similar number in the US, giving a potential market 
opportunity of around $60m. Whilst this is a relatively small market, 
Infacort
®
 is important as it will mark Diurnal’s first commercial launch.
Beyond the initial launch of Chronocort
®
 in CAH we have plans 
to develop the product for the much larger adult AI market, where 
there are potentially over 400,000 patients in the US and Europe.
When do expect your first drug  
to be approved and in which territory? 
Our most advanced product is Infacort
®
, where we anticipate 
recommendation for approval in Europe in late 2017 . This will 
represent a major milestone for the Group – few UK companies have 
successfully taken a product from concept to full commercialisation.
How will you commercialise  
the drugs in your portfolio?
A key benefit of working in diseases of cortisol deficiency is that 
there are a relatively small number of prescribing centres, usually 
based around teaching hospitals. This means that the market can 
be addressed with a modest sales force. During the last year, we 
have been working closely with Ashfield Healthcare to build the 
foundations of our commercial organisation in Europe, and now 
have individuals based in the five largest European markets: UK, 
Germany, France, Spain and Italy. This team will market Infacort
®
 
and, in due course, Chronocort
®
 to endocrinology specialists. 
In the US, where market access for a new product launch requires 
a deep expertise, we will most likely seek to partner with a company 
focused on hospital products, ideally with existing products in 
the endocrine space.
What key newsflow can we expect from  
the Group in the 2017/18 financial year? 
We envisage a very busy 12 months ahead, with a number of 
key events that will position the Group well to achieve its vision. 
Firstly, we anticipate approval of Infacort
®
 in Europe, leading to 
the first commercial sales during 2018. For our late stage pipeline, 
we anticipate completing recruitment in our Chronocort
®
 European 
Phase 3 study and announcing headline results. Importantly , we 
expect to start Phase 3 registration studies in the US for both 
Infacort
®
 and Chronocort
®
. We also expect to be able to announce 
progress in expanding Chronocort
®
 into new indications, which 
will drive future growth for this product. Notably, we anticipate 
further strengthening of our patents, which will provide valuable 
in-market protection for our lead- products. Finally, we continue 
to develop our early-stage pipeline, which is addressing further 
unmet needs in the endocrine space, and hope to announce 
further progress during the coming 12 months. STRATEGIC REPORT
8 Diurnal Group plc _ Annual Report 2017
The diseases we are targeting
Our markets
Congenital Adrenal 
Hyperplasia (CAH)
 + An orphan condition usually 
caused by deficiency of the 
enzyme 21-hydroxylase, required 
to produce the adrenal steroid 
hormone, cortisol. The block in 
the cortisol production pathway 
causes the over- production 
of male steroid hormones 
(androgens), which are 
precursors to cortisol.
 + The condition is congenital 
(inherited at birth) and affects 
both sexes.
 + The cortisol deficiency and 
over-production of male sex 
hormones can lead to increased 
mortality, infertility and severe 
development defects including 
ambiguous genitalia, premature 
(precocious) sexual development 
and short stature. Sufferers, 
even if treated, remain at risk of 
death through an adrenal crisis.
 + The condition is estimated to 
affect a total of approximately 
71,000 patients across Europe 
(51,000) and the US (20,000), 
with approximately 405,000 
in the rest of the world. The 
European and US markets 
are estimated to be worth a 
combined $0.5bn annually .
 + Current therapy for CAH uses a 
combination of generic steroids 
(hydrocortisone, dexamethasone 
and prednisolone) and are 
estimated to adequately treat 
approximately one third of 
CAH patients. 
Goals of our product 
development:
 + Improved drug treatments
 + Potential for reduced  
side-effects
 + Better patient adherence
 + Improved bioavailability
 + Improved patient outcomes
 + Cost effective treatment
Adrenal glands
Glands affected
Thyroid gland
Gonad glands
Pituitary gland
Adrenal Insufficiency (AI)
 + An orphan condition that results 
from a deficiency of cortisol 
secretion from the adrenal gland.
 + Primary AI results from diseases 
of the adrenal gland and 
secondary AI from pituitary 
diseases where there is a failure 
of stimulation of the adrenal.
 + In primary AI the most common 
condition is Addison’s disease, 
typically due to auto-immune 
destruction in the West and 
frequently caused by tuberculosis 
in the developing world. Addison’s 
disease is estimated to affect 
approximately 64,000 sufferers 
in Europe and 16,000 in the US 
with approximately 746,000 
sufferers in the rest of the world.
 + In secondary AI (hypopituitarism), 
the most common conditions are 
benign pituitary tumours or 
congenital disease in children. 
Hypopituitarism is estimated to 
affect approximately 231,000 
sufferers in Europe and 107,000 
in the US with approximately 
3,015,000 sufferers in the rest 
of the world.
 + The European and US markets 
are estimated to be worth a 
combined $2.9bn annually.
 + Current therapy for AI includes 
immediate-release and 
modified-release formulations 
of hydrocortisone which do 
not provide a release profile 
mimicking the natural circadian 
rhythm of cortisol.

The European and US markets 
are estimated to be worth a 
combined $0.4bn annually.

Hypogonadism
 + A condition that results from 
failure of the testes (primary 
gonadal failure) or from failure 
of stimulation by the pituitary 
(secondary hypogonadism).
 + In primary hypogonadism, failure 
of the testes can be congenital 
(inherited) or acquired due to 
a variety of causes (failure of 
the testes to descend into the 
scrotum, inflammation due 
to infections such as mumps, 
chemotherapy or radiotherapy 
affecting the testes, and 
removal of the testes for 
testicular tumours).
 + Secondary hypogonadism 
usually results from a benign 
tumour of the pituitary gland 
that causes hypopituitarism and 
may occasionally be congenital.
 + Hypogonadism in young men 
occurs in approximately 1% of 
the population. As testosterone 
falls with aging and in the obese, 
prevalence ranges from 12% 
to 50% as age increases. The 
classical hypogonadism market 
in Europe and the US is primarily 
driven by topical formulations 
(gels and patches) and long-acting 
injections which is estimated to 
be of a value of $4.0bn.
 + There is some controversy over 
the risks and benefits in replacing 
testosterone in older men 
(including the potential for 
cardiovascular disease). Diurnal 
is focused on developing 
testosterone replacement for 
men with clearly-defined 
hypogonadism according to 
current clinical guidelines.
Hypothyroidism
 + Hypothyroidism, caused by 
abnormal levels of thyroxine (T4) 
and triiodothyronine (T3) in the 
blood stream.
 + Primary hypothyroidism can be a 
result of dysfunction of the thyroid 
gland, with the most common 
cause being autoimmune 
destruction of the thyroid gland.
 + Less commonly, secondary 
hypothyroidism can be a result 
of failure of the pituitary, which 
stimulates the thyroid. The most 
common causes are benign 
pituitary tumours or surgery.
 + Rarely, hypothyroidism can be 
congenital (inherited) and this 
can be both primary and secondary .
 + Hypothyroidism can occur at any 
age, but is more frequent in the 
elderly, and it is estimated that 
up to 5% of people over 60 years 
of age are hypothyroid with an 
estimated market size for patients 
who do not respond to T4 
replacement therapy alone 
(T4 non-responders) of $600m 
per annum worldwide.
Cushing’s Syndrome/
Disease
 + Results from excess cortisol 
production either as a result 
of a tumour in the adrenal gland 
(Cushing’s syndrome) or from 
excess stimulation by benign 
tumours of the pituitary gland 
(Cushing’s disease).
 + Initial treatment is surgery , but 
up to 35% of patients with 
Cushing’s disease require 
long-term medical therapy 
as surgery is not successful.
 + There is an estimated 
drug-treatable prevalence of 
approximately 8,600 sufferers 
in Europe and 5,500 in the US.
 + It is most common in adults, 
between the ages of 20 and 
50 years old and it affects 
women more frequently 
than men.
 + The market opportunity is 
estimated to be in the region 
of $455m per annum worldwide.

in December 2015 through the delivery of key milestones contributing 
towards its vision of becoming a world-leading specialty pharma 
company focused on endocrinology .
 
In line with the Group’s strategy 
set out at the time of the IPO, and supported by the financial 
strength provided by the IPO, Diurnal has successfully completed 
the registration study and subsequent regulatory submission of 
Infacort
®
 in Europe, with recommendation for approval anticipated 
towards the end of 2017 , and commenced the build out of the Group’s 
commercial capability in Europe, with first revenues expected in 
2018. The progress the Group has made over the last year has set 
the business up for a commercial step change to drive the next 
stage of development.
 
Diurnal believes that it has an opportunity 
to become one of the few UK biotechnology companies to 
successfully take a product from concept to commercialisation.
Diurnal believes that its strategy of developing novel products using 
well-characterised active ingredients to meet significant unmet 
medical needs offers a lower risk approach than the development 
of new chemical or biological entities, whilst enabling significant 
in-market protection through both patent filings and regulatory 
protection.
 
For example, the active ingredient of both Infacort
®
 
and Chronocort
®
, hydrocortisone, is extremely well-tolerated, 
with an extensive safety database through over 50 years of clinical 
use.
 
Diurnal’s product candidates are protected by a wholly-owned 
patent portfolio, benefiting from granted or pending patents in 
key jurisdictions, along with strong protection through Orphan 
Drug designations.
Significant progress towards 
commercialisation of Infacort
®
 in Europe
Infacort
®
 is Diurnal’s most clinically advanced product and is the 
first preparation of hydrocortisone (the synthetic version of cortisol) 
specifically designed for use in children suffering from adrenal 
insufficiency (AI), including the related disease congenital adrenal 
hyperplasia (CAH).
 
Currently there is no licensed hydrocortisone 
preparation in Europe or the US specifically designed to treat 
these young patients.
 
Infacort
®
 is expected to be the first 
pharmaceutically defined dose and consistent formulation of 
hydrocortisone designed specifically for children.
 
The patented, 
immediate-release oral product has been designed to meet the 
dosing needs of children and is manufactured using commercially 
proven technology in paediatric acceptable doses to give maximum 
flexibility to clinicians in tailoring treatment to children as they 
develop and grow.
 
Currently , pharmacists often compound (grind) 
hydrocortisone tablets to a fine powder and reconstitute it into 
individual capsules or sachets to achieve the lower doses required 
for children.
 
Compounding is not a licensed method of producing 
medicines; it can be highly variable and may result in inaccurate 
dosing to patients.
At the start of the financial year, Diurnal announced positive 
headline data from the pivotal Phase III clinical trial for Infacort
®
 
in Europe for paediatric AI.
 
The study met its primary endpoint, 
demonstrating a statistically significant (p<0.0001) increase in 
cortisol values following administration of Infacort
®
 compared 
to the pre-dose values.
 
No serious adverse events were reported.
 
AI (and CAH) are identified as rare diseases in Europe, where there 
are estimated to be around 4,000 sufferers younger than the age 
of six.
 
Left untreated, the disease is associated with significant 
morbidity .
 
Many patients from the Phase III clinical trial are continuing 
treatment in the Group’s European open-label safety extension 
trial of long-term safety and biochemical disease control, which 
will provide further valuable safety data to support the registration 
and commercialisation of Infacort
®
.
Following the positive Phase III results, Diurnal submitted a paediatric 
use marketing authorisation (PUMA) application for Infacort
®
 
to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) in December 2016.
 
Shortly after the end of the financial year, and in line with regulatory 
evaluation, Diurnal provided responses to the questions (“Day 120 
questions”) received from the EMA following its review of the PUMA 
package, and the Group continues to anticipate recommendation 
for marketing authorisation approval for Infacort
®
 in Europe 
towards the end of 2017.
Addressing unmet patient 
needs in large markets
“ The Group is well positioned for its 
anticipated transformation into 
a fully integrated, world-leading, 
endocrinology-focused speciality 
pharma company.” 1 3  Diurnal Group plc _ Annual Report 2017
Reflecting a small, focused prescribing base, Diurnal intends 
to commercialise Infacort
®
 itself in the major European markets, 
following regulatory approval, in order to retain the full value of 
the product and has made significant progress during the year in 
establishing its European commercial operations. Diurnal’s small 
in-house commercial team has been supplemented through 
a service agreement with the respected global contract sales 
organisation Ashfield Healthcare (“Ashfield”) to support the 
Group in building its sales and medical infrastructure in major 
European territories. Ashfield, under the direction of the Group’s 
commercial leadership, has completed the planned first phase of 
establishing a Europe-wide team to prepare for the anticipated 
launch of Infacort
®
 in 2018, with ten individuals currently in place 
in key European territories and fully integrated with the Diurnal 
in-house team.
 
Outside of its core territories, Diurnal will seek 
local distribution arrangements where there is a significant 
market for the Group’s products and executed the first such 
agreement early in 2017.
 
During the year, Diurnal has also put in 
place the commercial supply chain for the manufacturing and 
packaging of Infacort
®
 with leading global expert service providers.
Continued progress in late-stage product pipeline
Diurnal’s second late-stage product candidate, Chronocort
®
, provides 
a drug release profile that the Group believes mimics the body’s 
natural cortisol circadian rhythm, which current therapy is unable 
to replicate. Chronocort
®
 is designed to improve disease control 
for adults with CAH: clinical data has shown that approximately 
two thirds of CAH patients are estimated to have poor disease 
control.
 
CAH sufferers, even if treated, remain at risk of death 
through an adrenal crisis and suffer from high morbidity and a 
poor quality of life.
 
The condition is estimated to affect approximately 
51,000 patients in Europe and 20,000 patients in the US, with 
approximately 405,000 patients in the rest of the world.
Chronocort
®
 is currently being assessed in a Phase III trial in Europe, 
which is designed to study up to 110 patients in an open-label 
six-month treatment protocol.
 
Enrolled patients currently treated 
with a single or combination of generic steroids (standard-of-care) 
will be randomised to Chronocort
®
 on a twice-daily “toothbrush” 
regimen or will continue on their standard-of-care regimen.
 
The primary endpoint of the trial is the control of androgens 
(sex hormones) on the same or lower total daily dose of steroid 
when treated with Chronocort
®
 compared to standard-of-care 
treatment.
 
This primary endpoint is identical to the previous 
successful Phase II clinical trial for Chronocort
®
.
 
Secondary 
endpoints will include an assessment of fatigue levels and the 
relative effect of Chronocort
®
 on body mass index and bone 
turnover, all of which are indicative of clinical benefits.
 
The trial 
continues to progress well with over 75% of patients recruited at 
the end of the financial year and is scheduled to complete in the 
first half of 2018, implying a potential recommendation for approval 
in Europe could be forthcoming around the end of 2019.
 
An open-label safety extension trial of long-term safety, efficacy 
and tolerability of Chronocort
®
 in patients with CAH, previously 
enrolled in the Phase III registration trial, commenced in August 2016 
and is intended to provide further valuable safety data to support 
the registration and commercialisation of Chronocort
®
.

Chief Executive’s review continued
Continued progress in late-stage 
product pipeline continued
The Group continues to progress discussions with the US Food and 
Drug Administration (FDA) regarding the requirements for the 
registration programme for Infacort
®
 and Chronocort
®
 in the US.
 
Clinical study design requirements for CAH differ between the 
US and Europe, meaning that a separate clinical programme will 
be required for registration of these two products in the US.
 
In 
June 2017, the Group dosed the first patient in a food matrix 
compatibility study for Infacort
®
 in healthy volunteers, which 
is intended to support the planned US registration package for 
Infacort
®
 for the treatment of paediatric AI. Diurnal is continuing 
discussion with the FDA to finalise additional requirements for 
the planned US registration package for Infacort
®
. After the end 
of the financial year Diurnal submitted a proposed Phase III pivotal 
US registration study design and supporting data package for 
Chronocort
® 
to the FDA and, subject to their agreement, expects 
to commence this study around the end of 2017.
Building a novel early-stage 
endocrinology pipeline
During the year , the Group has continued to build on its strong 
platform in underserved endocrinology diseases such as those 
associated with the gonads, pituitary and thyroid.
In late 2016, the Group announced dosing of the first patient with 
its native oral testosterone product, DITEST™, for the treatment 
of male hypogonadism in a Phase I clinical study designed to 
evaluate pharmacokinetics, safety and tolerability in male patients 
with hypogonadism.
 
Following a review of data from the first 
cohort of this study, in which the pharmacokinetics of DITEST™ 
were compared to testosterone undecanoate in patients following 
a meal, DITEST™ will progress to the second cohort of the study, 
which will compare its pharmacokinetics in a fed state and fasted 
state. The results from this study are expected in the first half 
of 2018. 
During the year, the Group initiated studies to assess the potency 
of different formulations of its oligonucleotide (siRNA) therapy, 
targeted to the pituitary gland, for the potential treatment of 
Cushing’s Disease (cortisol excess). If successful, these studies 
would facilitate to preclinical efficacy and safety studies, 
ahead of potentially entering a product candidate into human 
clinical development. 
Following a review of the current market for treatments for 
hypothyroidism, the Group has concluded that the needs of patients 
for replacement of T4 (thyroxine) are being met adequately with 
recently introduced products to the market. Accordingly , the Group 
has ceased work on its Tri4Combi™ formulation and is currently 
finalising plans for the development of a modified-release T3 
(triiodothyronine) product, where there remains a significant 
unmet medical need.
Maximising the commercial 
value of the product pipeline
As highlighted above, the Group has made excellent progress during 
the year in assembling a European sales and marketing force that 
is able to commercialise Infacort
®
 and subsequently Chronocort
®
 
and other pipeline products. The environment for the successful 
introduction of novel healthcare products in the US remains 
challenging, in particular with regards to ensuring that market 
access is optimised for a product launch.
 
Accordingly, Diurnal 
is likely to capitalise on the strong interest in its programmes 
and seek a US partner for commercialisation of its late-stage 
pipeline products at an appropriate time.
 
Diurnal will also seek 
local distribution arrangements for territories outside the US and 
Europe where there is a significant market for the Group’s products.
 
In March 2017, Diurnal announced a distribution agreement with 
Medison Pharma Limited (“Medison”) for Israel.
 
Medison is a leader 
in the marketing of specialist-focused products in Israel and will help 
Diurnal optimise the value of Infacort
®
 and Chronocort
®
 in this 
territory, subject to approval in Europe and subsequently in 
Israel. Diurnal continues to assess opportunities for similar 
agreements, addressing selected high-value markets.
 
In March 2017, the Group announced a partnership with Clinigen 
Group plc’s IDIS Managed Access division to launch a Patient 
Access programme in Europe for Infacort
®
 and Chronocort
®
 to 
ensure that patients with cortisol deficiency but no other treatment 
options can access these medicines as efficiently as possible ahead 
of anticipated European approval and commercial launch.  1 5  Diurnal Group plc _ Annual Report 2017
Extensive in-market protection 
Diurnal continues to protect its product candidates through an 
extensive patent portfolio, benefiting from a number of granted 
or pending patents in key jurisdictions.
 
During the year, the Group 
received notification of the grant of three US Infacort
®
 patents, 
of which two key patents have been granted: a composition of 
matter patients for the product formulation and a method of treatment 
patent for all forms of adrenal insufficiency . These granted patents 
provide in-market protection for Infacort
®
 to 2034.
 
The Group 
expects to continue to expand patent coverage for its pipeline 
products in the future.
In addition to the strong and growing patent protection for its 
pipeline products, the FDA has granted Chronocort
®
 Orphan 
Drug designation in the treatment of both CAH and AI and has 
granted Infacort
®
 Orphan Drug designation in the treatment 
of paediatric AI.
 
Diurnal has applied for a PUMA for Infacort
®
 
in Europe, whilst Chronocort
®
 already benefits from the Orphan 
Drug designations for CAH and AI in Europe.
 
These Orphan Drug 
designations mean Infacort
®
 and Chronocort
®
 have the potential 
to be granted market and data exclusivity for ten years in Europe 
and seven years in the US post market authorisation.
Outlook
The Group is well positioned for its anticipated transformation into 
a fully integrated, world-leading, endocrinology-focused specialty 
pharma company with the recommendation for approval of its 
first product, Infacort
®
, which Diurnal continues to expect in 
H2 2017. Together with its other late-stage product, Chronocort
®
, 
Diurnal has the opportunity to build a life-long adrenal franchise, 
providing critical medicine in underserved diseases of cortisol 
deficiency.
 
With the European Chronocort
®
 pivotal trial on track 
to read out in the first half of 2018, and with over 75% of patients 
already recruited by the end of the financial year, the Group 
believes that a recommendation for approval in Europe could be 
forthcoming around the end of 2019. Reflecting a combined market 
size estimated at over 400,000 patients in Europe and the US 
alone for Infacort
®
 and Chronocort
®
, the Board believes that 
the potential for Diurnal looks very positive.

Financial review
Operating income and expenses
Operating expenses are in a growth phase, reflecting the increased 
clinical and development activities together with investment in 
headcount and business infrastructure to support the transition 
of the business to a fully-integrated speciality pharma organisation 
with product origination, development and commercialisation 
capabilities. This continued investment in the business will support 
its anticipated growth and development in the coming years.
Research and development expenditure for the year was £8.3m 
(2016: £3.9m). Expenditure on product development and clinical costs 
increased in the period as the Group submitted the Infacort
®
 PUMA 
application to the EMA and continued to progress Chronocort
®
 in 
a Phase III registration trial in Europe. The Group also recruited the 
first patients from the Chronocort
®
 Phase III trial into a long-term 
follow-on study and commenced a Phase I study with its native 
oral testosterone product in hypogonadal patients. Staff-related 
expenditure also increased as a result of the appointment of new staff 
and the full impact of the implementation of a new remuneration 
policy, comprising annual bonus and long-term incentive schemes 
in H2 2015 following the IPO. The Group has not capitalised 
development costs for Infacort
®
 during the financial year following 
the successful Phase III trial in Europe since a key element of the 
in-market protection for Infacort
®
 is the exclusivity afforded by the 
PUMA, which only takes effect once the product is approved by the 
EU. The Group intends capitalising Infacort
®
 development costs 
under IAS 38 following the anticipated approval of the PUMA.
Administrative expenses for the year were £3.7m (2016: £3.1m). 
A substantial increase in pre-commercialisation expenses, as the 
Group prepares for the anticipated launch of Infacort
®
 in 2018, 
along with the appointment of new staff and the full impact of 
the implementation of a new remuneration policy in the prior 
period was offset by costs of £0.6m in the prior period relating 
to fees paid in connection with the AIM admission.
Operating loss
Operating loss for the year increased to £12.1m (2016: £7.0m), 
reflecting the increased operating expenses outlined above.
Financial income and expense
Financial income in the period was £182k (2016: £63k), due to 
the higher average cash balances during the year: the funds from 
the IPO fundraising and the convertible loan were received in late 
December 2015 and consequently only had an impact for half 
of the prior year. Financial expense for the period was £272k 
(2016: £133k), being the financial expense of the convertible loan. 
No interest is payable in cash on this loan, the financial expense 
representing the effective interest required under accounting 
standards to charge the transaction costs and equity element 
of the loan to the income statement over the term of the loan. 
Loss on ordinary activities before tax
Loss before tax for the period was £12.2m (2016: £7.1m).
Building to support 
future development
“ The continued investment 
in the business will support 
its anticipated growth and 
development in the 
coming years.” 1 7  Diurnal Group plc _ Annual Report 2017
Tax
The current year includes Research & Development tax 
credits relating to the year ended 30 June 2016 of £911k, 
received in August 2017 , as well as the estimated claim in 
respect of the year ended 30 June 2017 of £1,819k, which 
has not yet been submitted to HMRC. The prior year 
includes a credit in respect of the approval by HMRC of the 
R&D tax credit claim for the period ended 30 June 2015. 
The Group has not recognised any deferred tax assets 
in respect of trading losses arising in either the current 
financial period or accumulated losses in previous 
financial years.
Earnings per share
Loss per share was 18.0 pence (2016: 15.0 pence). Loss 
per share has increased due to the higher operating costs 
explained above.
Cash flow
Net cash used in operating activities was £10.5m (2016: £5.1m), 
driven by the planned increase in investment in R&D and 
business infrastructure during the year. Net cash from 
investing activities was £3.2m (2016: net cash used in 
investing activities £14.0m) reflecting a net movement 
from longer-dated held to maturity financial assets to 
short-dated cash and cash equivalents. Net cash generated 
by financing during the prior period of £29.1m reflects 
the net proceeds of the issue of shares in the IPO and funds 
received from issue of the convertible loan in December 2015.
Balance sheet
Total assets decreased to £23.9m (2016: £30.7m), largely 
reflecting the utilisation of cash in operating activities 
highlighted above. Held to maturity financial assets were 
£11.0m (2016: £14.0m) and cash and cash equivalents were 
£8.9m (2016: £16.1m). Total liabilities increased to £6.9m 
(2016: £4.7m), reflecting an increase in trade payables and 
accruals at the year end associated with the increased 
level of operating activities. Net assets were £17.1m 
(2016: £25.9m).
Comparative information
The Group has applied the principles of reverse acquisition 
accounting under IFRS 3 ‘Business Combinations’ in the 
presentation of consolidated shareholders’ equity for the 
prior period. These comparative periods show the results 
of the accounting acquirer (Diurnal Limited) along with the 
share capital structure of the parent company (Diurnal Group 
plc). As a result, the consolidated share capital and share 
premium presented for comparative periods is that which 
was in existence immediately following the share for share 
exchange which occurred on 1 December 2015, and which 
is explained further in Note 2 to the financial statements.

Principal risks and uncertainties
How we manage risk
The management of risk is a key responsibility of the Board of 
Directors. The Board ensures that all key risks are understood and 
appropriately managed considering the Group’s strategy and 
objectives, and that an effective risk management process, 
including appropriate internal controls, is in place to identify, 
quantify, minimise and manage important risks.
The Audit Committee oversees risk management on behalf of the 
Board. During the year , the Audit Committee has overseen the 
implementation of a comprehensive risk register, which has 
a number of key objectives:
 + to confirm and communicate key risks facing the Group;
 + to establish and promote the importance of risk management 
across the Group;
 + to establish a methodology for assessment of risk and to 
ensure those risks assessed as having a higher level of impact 
are proactively managed; and
 + to assign responsibility management of each risk.
Operational risk management
To effectively manage the business, including risks, the Group 
regularly reviews progress of key activities as follows:
 + The Board of Directors meets regularly and reviews operational 
progress against the Group’s strategy and key objectives.
 + The Audit Committee meets regularly and will review the risk 
register and mitigating action plans to ensure that these 
address risks to achieving the Group’s strategy and objectives.
 + The senior management team meets at least once a month 
to review operational progress and, during these meetings, 
identify and discuss areas of risk and communicate these 
to the Board as appropriate.
 + Commercial, Development and Quality teams, in addition to 
project teams, meet at least once a month to review progress 
of all key projects and identify key issues for discussion with 
the senior management team.

, the Group discussed requirements with the 
European Medicines Agency (EMA) and has used subject 
matter experts alongside its highly experienced internal team 
for compilation of the regulatory dossier and response to 
questions raised during the review process.
Delays in clinical 
study enrolment
Timely subject enrolment is a common challenge for 
pharmaceutical development. The Group seeks to proactively 
address this with detailed feasibility, careful selection of 
Contract Research Organisations appropriate for the size 
and complexity of a particular study, and close operational 
oversight of projects, including weekly update reports.
Increase in number, 
size and complexity 
of clinical trials.
Design of suitable clinical 
trials including agreement 
of regulatory endpoints
With the Group’s focus on underserved endocrine diseases, 
regulatory development pathways are by their nature less well 
defined. The Group seeks to engage with key opinion leaders, 
patient groups and regulators at an early stage to identify 
factors having a significant impact on patients’ quality of life 
and health outcomes suitable for assessment in clinical studies.
Reimbursement
Both Infacort
®
 and Chronocort
®
 Phase III programmes include 
follow-on studies designed to assess longer-term impact of 
these therapies on important clinical measures that impact 
patient quality of life. The Group has engaged specialist

Significant exchange 
rate movements
The Group assesses its currency needs on a rolling basis 
and either holds currency deposits or will enter into forward 
exchange arrangements to provide certainty against its 
budgeted exchange rates for expenditure in Euros and 
US Dollars. Over time, revenues from planned product 
launches in Europe and the US should provide a natural 
hedge for operating expenses.

Chronocort
®
: mimicking the 
human circadian rhythm in 
diseases of cortisol deficiency
Case study
Current treatments for 
cortisol deficiency often lead 
to poor disease control
Cortisol is an essential hormone 
where a distinct circadian rhythm 
is required for health. Cortisol 
deficiency causes fatigue, depression 
and death through adrenal crisis. 
Around two-thirds of patients with 
congenital adrenal hyperplasia have 
poor disease control. A particular 
problem is a build up of sex hormones 
(androgens) in the night, leading to 
damage to the body . Current therapy 
does not adequately control 
overnight androgen levels.
Chronocort is designed 
to mimic the human 
circadian rhythm of 
cortisol based upon 
a twice-daily 
“toothbrush” 
dosing regimen
Phase II results show Chronocort
®
 
improves disease control with 
morning androgens controlled in 
94% of patients on Chronocort
®
 
compared to 31% on standard 
treatment. This control is expected 
to lead to significant clinical 
benefits for patients.

Introduction to corporate governance
Chairman’s governance overview
I am pleased to present the Corporate

a key role in the Group’s governance by

controls and risk management procedures is 
in place. This section of the Annual Report 
describes our corporate governance 
structures and processes and how they 
have been applied throughout the year 
ended 30 June 2017.

Corporate governance report
The Board
The Board comprises seven Directors; three Executive Directors and 
four Non-Executive Directors, each bringing a different experience 
and background. Two of the Non-Executive Directors are considered 
by the Board to be independent: Peter Allen and John Goddard. 
Sam Williams and Alan Raymond represent key investors in the 
Company and, as such, are not considered to be independent. 
The Board considers there to be sufficient independence on the 
Board given the size and stage of development of the Group and 
that all the Non-Executive Directors are of sufficient competence 
and calibre to add strength and objectivity to the Board.
Peter Allen is the Chairman and Martin Whitaker is the Chief 
Executive Officer, each with clearly defined responsibilities. 
Peter Allen operates in a non-executive capacity. The Chairman 
leads the Board and is responsible for organising the business 
of the Board, ensuring its effectiveness and setting its agenda. 
The Chairman has no involvement in the day-today management 
of the Group. The Chairman facilitates the effective contribution 
of Non-Executive Directors and constructive relations between 
executive and Non-Executive Directors, ensures Directors receive 
accurate, timely and clear information and that effective 
communication occurs with institutional shareholders.
The Board is responsible to the shareholders for the proper 
management of the Group and meets regularly and at least six times 
in the year to set the overall direction and strategy of the Group 
and to review operational and financial performance. The Board 
has also convened on an ad-hoc basis between scheduled Board 
meetings to review the strategy and activities of the business. 
The key responsibilities of the Board are as follows:
 + setting the Group’s values and standards;
 + approval of long-term objectives and strategy;
 + approval of budgets and plans;
 + oversight of operations ensuring adequate systems of internal 
controls and risk management are in place, maintenance of 
accounting and other records and compliance with statutory 
and regulatory obligations;
 + review of performance in light of strategy and budgets, 
ensuring any necessary corrective actions are taken;
 + approval of the Annual Report and financial statements and 
major projects such as potential new product acquisitions;
 + changes to structure, size and the composition of the Board;
 + determining the remuneration policy for the executive 
Directors and approval of the remuneration of the 
Non-Executive Directors; and
 + review of communications with shareholders and the market.
All Directors receive appropriate and timely information and all 
Directors have access to the advice and services of the Company 
Secretary , who is responsible for ensuring that the Board procedures 
are followed and that applicable rules and regulations are complied 
with. Updates are given to the Board on developments in governance 
and regulations as appropriate, including presentations from the 
Company’s Nomad and legal advisors. The Company Secretary 
supports the Chairman in ensuring that the Board receives the 
information and support it needs in order to carry out its roles. 
In addition, the Directors are able to obtain independent 
professional advice in the furtherance of their duties, if 
necessary, at the Group’s expense.
At each Annual General Meeting (AGM) of the Company , one-third 
of the Directors shall retire from office by rotation provided always 
that all Directors must be subject to re-election at intervals of no 
more than three years. Directors appointed during any year are 
subject to re-election at the next AGM after taking office.  25  Diurnal Group plc _ Annual Report 2017
Conflicts of interest
Each Director has a duty to avoid situations in which he has or can have a direct or indirect interest that conflicts, or possibly may 
conflict, with the interests of the Group. The Board requires each Director to declare to the Board the nature and extent of any direct or 
indirect interest in a proposed transaction or arrangement with the Group and the Company Secretary maintains a register of Directors’ 
other interests. The Board has power to authorise any potentially conflicting interests that are disclosed by a Director. Directors are 
required to notify the Company Secretary when any potential conflict of interest arises.
Attendance at Board meetings

Board performance evaluation
The Board has a process for evaluation of its own performance 
and that of its Committees and individual Directors, including the 
Chairman. The Board intends that these evaluations are carried 
out annually.
Board Committees
In order to effectively manage governance of the Group, the 
Board has delegated certain responsibilities to sub-committees. 
The Board has established Audit, Remuneration and Nomination 
Committees, each with written terms of reference. If the need 
should arise, the Board may set up additional committees, as 
appropriate. All of the Board Committees are authorised to 
obtain, at the Group’s expense, professional advice on any matter 
within their terms of reference and to have access to sufficient 
resources in order to carry out their duties.
Audit Committee including 
the Audit Committee Report
The Audit Committee comprises four members, who are all 
Non-Executive Directors: John Goddard (Chairman), Peter Allen, 
Alan Raymond and Sam Williams. Peter Allen and John Goddard 
are qualified Chartered Accountants and have significant 
experience gained in senior financial management positions 
and as Non-Executive Directors and Audit Committee members 
and chairmen.
The Audit Committee has responsibility for, among other things, 
the monitoring of the financial integrity of the financial statements 
of the Group and the involvement of the Group’s auditors in that 
process. It focuses, in particular, on compliance with accounting 
policies and ensuring that an effective system of audit and financial 
control is maintained, including considering the scope of the 
annual audit and the extent of the non-audit work undertaken 
by external auditors and advising on the appointment of external 
auditors. The ultimate responsibility for reviewing and approving 
the Annual Report and accounts and the half yearly reports remains 
with the Board. The Audit Committee also focuses on risk 
management processes within the Group and ensure that the 
appropriate controls and mitigation steps are implemented by 
the senior management team.
The Audit Committee will meet at least three times a year at the 
appropriate times in the financial reporting and audit cycle and 
at such other times as may be deemed necessary. The terms of 
reference of the Audit Committee cover such issues as membership 
and the frequency of meetings, together with requirements of 
any quorum for, and the right to attend, meetings. 
The responsibilities of the Audit Committee covered in its terms 
of reference include the following: external audit, financial reporting, 
internal controls and risk management. The terms of reference also 
set out the authority of the committee to carry out its responsibilities. CORPORATE GOVERNANCE
26 Diurnal Group plc _ Annual Report 2017
Corporate governance report continued
Audit Committee including 
the Audit Committee Report continued
The Audit Committee met four times during 2016/17, to review:
 + the audit strategy and plan for the 2015/16 full year results;
 + the 2015/16 final results prior to their submission for approval 
to the full Board;
 + the 2016/17 interim results prior to their submission for 
approval to the full Board; and
 + the audit strategy and plan for the 2016/17 full year results.
During the year the Committee considered the appropriateness of 
accounting policies, including accounting for the share transactions 
in the Company , the treatment of the costs of the IPO, the principles 
of reverse acquisition accounting in relation to the Group restructure, 
the accounting for the share based payments and for the 
convertible loan. 
Any non-audit services that are to be provided by the external 
auditors are reviewed in order to safeguard auditor objectivity 
and independence. During the year the Committee considered 
the external auditor’s procedures to safeguard independence 
and objectivity and the Committee confirmed that the non-audit 
services earned by the external auditor for work performed in 
relation to and prior to the IPO are not considered to have impaired 
its objectivity and independence. The breakdown between audit and 
non-audit services is shown in Note 4 to the Financial Statements. 
The external auditor has the opportunity during the Audit Committee 
meetings to meet privately with Audit Committee members in 
the absence of executive management.
The Company has a whistleblowing policy, in which staff may 
notify management or Non-Executive Directors of any concerns 
regarding suspected wrongdoing or dangers at work.
Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee comprises four members, all of 
whom are Non-Executive Directors: Alan Raymond (Chairman), 
John Goddard, Peter Allen and Sam Williams.
The Remuneration Committee has responsibility for determination 
of specific remuneration packages for each of the Executive 
Directors and certain senior executives of the Group, including 
pension rights and any compensation payments, and recommending 
and monitoring the level and structure of remuneration for senior 
management, and the implementation of share incentive, or other 
performance-related schemes. It meets at least twice a year and 
at such other times as may be deemed necessary . The Remuneration 
Committee also generates an annual remuneration report to be 
approved by the members of the Company at the Annual General 
Meeting. The Directors’ Remuneration Report is presented on 
pages 28 to 31.
The responsibilities of the Remuneration Committee covered 
in its terms of reference include the following: determining 
and monitoring policy on and setting levels of remuneration, 
termination, performance-related pay, pension arrangements, 
reporting and disclosure, share incentive plans and remuneration 
consultants. The terms of reference also set out the reporting 
responsibilities and the authority of the committee to carry out

John Goddard, Alan Raymond and Sam Williams.
The Nomination Committee is responsible for considering and 
making recommendations to the Board in respect of appointments

Board committees. It is also responsible for keeping the structure, 
size and composition of the Board under regular review, and for 
making recommendations to the Board regarding any changes 
necessary, taking into account the skills and expertise that will be 
needed on the Board in the future. The Nomination Committee’s 
terms of reference deal with such things as membership, quorum 
and reporting responsibilities. The Nomination Committee intends 
to meet at least once a year and at such other times as may be

Share dealing code
The Company has adopted a code on dealings in relation to 
the securities of the Company. The Company shall require the 
Directors and other relevant employees of the Group to comply 
with the Share Dealing Code and takes proper and reasonable 
steps to secure their compliance. 27  Diurnal Group plc _ Annual Report 2017
Internal controls
The Board has overall responsibility for ensuring that the Group 
maintains a system of internal control to provide reasonable 
assurance that the Group’s assets are safeguarded and that the 
shareholders’ investments are protected. The system includes 
internal controls covering financial, operational and regulatory 
compliance areas, together with risk management. The principal 
risks and uncertainties for the Group are set out on pages 18 and 19 
of this Annual Report. The Group maintains a risk register, which 
is reviewed and updated regularly. Each potential risk across the 
Group will be assessed against the likelihood of occurrence and 
the impact on the business, should the risk be realised.
The Board has established, maintains and is responsible for 
assessing and reviewing the effectiveness of the Group’s system 
of internal control. Some of the key features of the internal 
control procedures are as described below.
 + Each year , the Board approves the annual budget and performance 
is monitored against budget, with relevant action being taken 
throughout the year. Expenditure is regulated by the budgetary 
process together with authorisation levels and for expenditure 
exceeding a certain level, Board approval is required.
 + In addition to the expenditure authorisation control, other financial 
controls operate around the payroll and payment processes 
and the monthly accounting cycle, including the review and 
reconciliation of certain accounts. Segregation of duties and dual 
signature controls exist where appropriate and practicable.
 + The external auditors provide a supplementary, independent 
perspective on those areas of the internal control system 
which they assess in the course of their work. Their findings 
are reported to the Board via the Audit Committee.
Employment
The Board recognises its legal responsibility to ensure the wellbeing, 
safety and welfare of its employees and to maintain a safe and 
healthy working environment for them and for its visitors.
Financial and business reporting
The Board seeks to present a balanced and understandable 
assessment of the Group’s position and prospects in all half year, 
final and price-sensitive reports and other information required 
to be presented by statute. The Board receives a number of reports 
to enable it to monitor and clearly understand the Group’s 
financial position. Procedures have been put in place to ensure 
that price-sensitive information is identified effectively and all 
communications with the market are released in accordance 
with expected time scales.
Investor relations
The Board encourages communications with all shareholders. 
There is regular dialogue with major, institutional shareholders, 
usually after the announcement of half year and full year results. 
Presentations are made to analysts at those times to present the 
Group’s results; these presentations being webcast and made 
available on the Group’s website. This assists with the promotion 
of knowledge of the Group in the investment marketplace and with 
the existing shareholders. The process also helps the Directors 
to understand the needs and expectations of shareholders. 
The Directors use the Annual Report and Financial Statements 
and the Annual General Meeting as opportunities to engage 
with its private investors in addition to its institutional investors. 
The Board believes that the Annual General Meeting offers an 
excellent opportunity to communicate directly with shareholders. 
This year’s Annual General Meeting will be held on 21 November 2017 
and details of the resolutions to be proposed at the meeting can 
be found in the Notice of Meeting at the end of this Annual Report.
Stakeholder and social responsibilities
The Board believes that good corporate governance encompasses 
assessing the Company’s impact on and contribution to society, 
its community and the environment. The Board recognises its 
responsibilities to shareholders and also to other stakeholders, 
such as employees, customers and suppliers and to the patients 
who will ultimately benefit from its products.

Remuneration report
Introduction
This report sets out the remuneration policy operated by the 
Group in respect of the Executive and Non-Executive Directors. 
Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee consists of Alan Raymond (Chairman), 
Peter Allen, John Goddard and Sam Williams. 
The Remuneration Committee has responsibility for the following:
 + determining and monitoring remuneration policy;
 + determination of specific remuneration packages for each of the 
Executive Directors and certain senior executives of the Group, 
including pension rights and any compensation payments;
 + recommending and monitoring the level and structure of 
remuneration for senior management;
 + implementing share incentive or other 
performance-related schemes;
 + reporting and disclosure of remuneration; and
 + the use of remuneration consultants, as appropriate.
There were two Remuneration Committee meetings during the year.
Policy on remuneration of Executive Directors
It is the Group’s policy to provide remuneration packages that:
 + are competitive with those of other companies of a similar 
size, complexity and stage of development; 
 + reward delivery of value to shareholders and achievement 
of the Group’s key strategic objectives;
 + motivate and retain business-critical employees; and
 + enable the Group to continue to attract high quality recruits.
Components of the remuneration package
The principal components of Executive Directors’ remuneration 
packages are basic salary, a performance related bonus, medium- 
and long-term incentives in the form of share options, pension 
contributions and other benefits. The policy in relation to each 
of these components, and the key terms of the various incentive 
and benefit programmes are explained further below.
Basic salary
Base salaries are reviewed annually, with the level of increases 
for Executive Directors taking account of the increases awarded 
to the workforce as a whole, as well as a consideration of the 
performance of the Group and the individual, skill set and experience 
and external indicators such as salaries in comparable companies 
and inflation. At the time of the IPO, the Remuneration Committee 
performed a benchmarking of Executive and Non-Executive Director 
remuneration and concluded that the salary levels of the Executive 
Directors were currently positioned below mid-market levels. 
Reflecting the Group’s progress towards entering a commercialisation 
phase, salaries have been increased to a mid-market position. 
Accordingly, with effect from 1 April 2017 the base salary of 
Martin Whitaker, Chief Executive Officer, was increased to 
£200,000. Richard Bungay, Chief Financial Officer, commenced 
employment with the Group on 16 January 2017 on a base salary 
of £150,000, which was increased to £170,000 on 1 May 2017. 
Performance-related bonus
The Remuneration Committee, in discussion with the Executive 
Directors, establishes performance criteria at the beginning of each 
financial year that are aligned with the Group’s strategic objectives 
and are designed to be challenging. Any annual bonus for Executive 
Directors is payable in cash and deferred share awards under the 
following proportions: 50% cash, 50% deferred share awards.
The number of ordinary shares comprised within deferred share 
awards will be set on grant at such number equal in value to the 
portion of the bonus being deferred, adjusted as necessary to 
neutralise the cost of exercise where awards are structured as 
nominal cost options. Such deferred share awards to Executive 
Directors will ordinarily vest after one year, subject only to 
continued employment. 29  Diurnal Group plc _ Annual Report 2017
Annual bonuses are payable at the sole discretion of the 
Remuneration Committee and are currently capped at 100% 
of salary for the Chief Executive Officer and 70% of salary 
for the Chief Financial Officer. 
The performance criteria for the 2016/17 financial year included 
clinical (lead programmes and pipeline) and commercial milestones 
and have plan and stretch components. The Remuneration Committee 
have determined that no bonus should be paid in respect of the 
2016/17 financial year since neither the stretch nor the plan 
components of the objectives were achieved. The performance 
criteria for the 2017/18 financial year include clinical (lead programmes 
and pipeline) and commercial milestones and have plan and 
stretch components.
Long-term incentive plan (LTIP)
It is currently intended that the primary long-term incentive 
arrangement for Executive Directors, senior managers and all 
eligible staff will be delivered in the form of “performance share 
awards” under the performance share award feature of the LTIP. 
Awards will ordinarily be granted on an annual basis, shortly following 
announcement of the annual results. In the normal course of 
events, such performance share awards under the LTIP will vest 
three years from award, or upon the assessment of performance 
conditions, if later, subject to the participant’s continued service 
and to the extent to which performance conditions specified for 
the awards are satisfied.
Such awards are currently planned equal in value to up to 100% 
of base salary for the Chief Executive Officer and up to 75% of 
salary for the Chief Financial Officer (adjusted as necessary to 
neutralise the cost of exercise where the awards are structured 
as nominal cost options).
The first performance share awards to Executive Directors under 
the LTIP were made following the announcement of the Group’s 
annual results for the financial year ending 30 June 2016 up to such 
level. Selected senior managers and other employees, at the 
Remuneration Committee’s discretion, will also participate in 
the performance share award element of the LTIP.
Pension arrangements
Pension is to be provided either via a contribution into the Group’s 
defined contribution plan, or, in the event an individual is unable 
to make pension contributions, via a cash supplement. The level 
of pension for the Executive Directors is 10% of basic salary.
Other benefits
Other benefits for Executive Directors include life assurance, 
private medical insurance and income protection insurance.
Policies and guidelines
Recovery and withholding provisions may be operated at the 
discretion of the Remuneration Committee in respect of awards 
granted under the annual bonus plan and the LTIP in certain 
circumstances, (including where there has been a misstatement 
of accounts, an error in assessing any applicable performance 
condition or in the event of misconduct on the part of the participant.
The Company has adopted shareholding guidelines in order to 
encourage Executive Directors to build or maintain a shareholding 
in the Company equivalent in value to no less than 100% of salary, 
primarily through the acquisition of shares under share option 
agreements. An Executive Director will be expected to retain at 
least half of the shares vesting (net of those sold to fund exercise 
price and taxation liabilities) under the Group’s discretionary share 
based employee incentive schemes until the guideline is met.
Directors’ service contracts
The Group’s policy is for Executive Directors to have contracts

Statement of Directors’ responsibilities
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Strategic Report, 
the Directors’ Report and the Group and parent company financial 
statements in accordance with applicable law and regulations. 
Company law requires the Directors to prepare Group and parent 
company financial statements for each financial year. As required 
by the AIM Rules of the London Stock Exchange they are required 
to prepare the Group financial statements in accordance with 
International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted 
by the EU (EU IFRS) and applicable law and have elected to prepare 
the parent company financial statements on the same basis. 
Under company law the Directors must not approve the financial 
statements unless they are satisfied that they give a true and fair 
view of the state of affairs of the Group and parent company and 
of their profit or loss for that period. In preparing each of the 
Group and parent company financial statements, the Directors 
are required to:
 + select suitable accounting policies and then apply 
them consistently; 
 + make judgments and estimates that are reasonable 
and prudent; 
 + state whether they have been prepared in accordance with 
IFRSs as adopted by the EU; 
 + assess the Group and parent company’s ability to continue as 
a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters relating to 
going concern; and 
 + use the going concern basis of accounting unless they intend 
to liquidate the Group or the parent company or to cease 
operations, or have no realistic alternative to do so.
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting 
records that are sufficient to show and explain the Group and 
parent company’s transactions and disclose with reasonable 
accuracy at any time the financial position of the Group and 
parent company and enable them to ensure that its financial 
statements comply with the Companies Act 2006. They are 
responsible for such internal control as they determine is necessary 
to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free 
from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and 
have general responsibility for taking such steps as are reasonably 
open to them to safeguard the assets of the Group and to prevent 
and detect fraud and other irregularities.
Under applicable law and regulations, the Directors are also 
responsible for preparing a Strategic Report and a Directors’ 
Report that complies with that law and those regulations. Protecting our products:  
intellectual property
Robust intellectual 
property strategy
Diurnal protects its products using 
a multi-layered approach, including 
its internal expertise (know-how), 
patents covering its products in major 
territories, Orphan Drug designations 
and trademarks.
Know-how
Diurnal’s team has 
considerable expertise in 
the selection of 
formulation technologies 
and approaches and 
combining these to give 
the desired therapeutic 
profile and also to create a 
novel, patentable product.
Orphan Drug Designation 
Infacort
®
 and Chronocort
®
 have Orphan Drug designations 
in the US, which are expected to provide seven years of 
market and data exclusivity upon receiving regulatory 
approval. Similarly, Chronocort
®
 has Orphan Drug 
designation in Europe which is expected to provide ten 
years of market and data exclusivity upon receiving 
regulatory approval. A paediatric use marketing authorisation 
(PUMA) was filed for Infacort
®
 in 2016 which, if approved, 
is expected to provide ten years of market and data 
exclusivity in Europe.
Patents 
Diurnal has filed patents 
in relation to its novel 
product pipeline, of which 
a number are granted. 
A key milestone achieved 
during 2017 was the grant 
of the three key patents 
in the US relating to the 
Infacort
®
 formulation. 
These patents will 
provide robust in-market 
protection for Infacort
®
 in 
a key geographic market.
Trademarks 
Diurnal has undertaken extensive brand development 
for its late-stage products and protects this investment 
through careful selection of brand names and registering 
these as trademarks in all of its key territories.

Case study
35  Diurnal Group plc _ Annual Report 2017 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
36 Diurnal Group plc _ Annual Report 2017
Independent auditor’s report 
to the members of Diurnal Group plc
1 Our opinion is unmodified 
We have audited the financial statements of Diurnal Group plc 
(“the Company”) for the year ended 30 June 2017 which comprise 
the consolidated income statement, consolidated statement of 
comprehensive income, consolidated balance sheet, Company 
balance sheet, consolidated and Company statements of 
changes in equity, consolidated and Company cash flow 
statements, and the related notes, including the accounting 
policies in Note 2. 
In our opinion: 
 + the financial statements give a true and fair view of the state 
of the Group’s and of the parent company’s affairs as at 
30 June 2017 and of the Group’s loss for the year then ended; 
 + the Group financial statements have been properly prepared in 
accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as 
adopted by the European Union (IFRSs as adopted by the EU); 
 + the parent company financial statements have been properly 
prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU and 
as applied in accordance with the provisions of the Companies 
Act 2006; and 
 + the financial statements have been prepared in accordance 
with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006. 
Basis for opinion 
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards 
on Auditing (UK) (“ISAs (UK)”) and applicable law. Our responsibilities 
are described below. We have fulfilled our ethical responsibilities 
under, and are independent of the Group in accordance with, UK 
ethical requirements including the FRC Ethical Standard as applied 
to listed entities. We believe that the audit evidence we have 
obtained is a sufficient and appropriate basis for our opinion. 
2 Key audit matters: our assessment 
of risks of material misstatement 
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional 
judgment, were of most significance in the audit of the financial 
statements and include the most significant assessed risks of material 
misstatement (whether or not due to fraud) identified by us, 
including those which had the greatest effect on: the overall 
audit strategy; the allocation of resources in the audit; and 
directing the efforts of the engagement team. These matters 
were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial 
statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, 
and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. 
In arriving at our audit opinion above, the key audit matters, 
in decreasing order of audit significance, were as follows: 
Completeness of capitalised development costs
Refer to page 25 (Audit Committee Report), page 44 (Accounting 
Policy) and page 47 (financial disclosures).
The risk 
 + Accounting treatment – Project development costs are 
capitalised if they meet the criteria of relevant accounting 
standards, which require, among other things, an assessment 
of the technical stage of the project and of the future commercial 
out-turn of the project. These costs are otherwise expensed as 
incurred. The Group has two assets currently in development 
at different stages in the regulatory process. The Group is 
developing its own products through a regulatory review to 
commercialisation, which is a rare situation in the industry, 
and the Group has no track history of commercialising such 
products. The point at which commercial viability is demonstrated 
may differ for each project depending on the specifics of the 
marketing approval granted by the regulator and involves 
uncertainty . Due to the above, assessing whether the capitalisation 
criteria are met is inherently judgemental and there is a risk 
that the appropriate point in time for capitalisation is not 
identified appropriately and therefore costs continue to be 
expensed when they should be capitalised. 
Our response 
Our procedures included:
 + Testing application – We reviewed the status of the two projects 
currently ongoing and to which the majority of research and 
development spend relates. We identified the technical and 
commercial status of each of these projects and made an 
assessment of how the status of each project compared to 
the capitalisation criteria set out in IAS 38. This included an 
assessment of the likely commercial impacts of marketing 
approval for Infacort in particular due to the in-market 
protection required for commercialisation to be a success. 
 + Inspection of reports – We corroborated the status of the two 
projects by reviewing project milestone announcements, analysing 
reports from third party technical consultants and contractors, 
and where available communications and documentation from 
the regulator regarding approval of the projects. 
Recoverability of carrying value of investment in subsidiary 
(parent company only)
Refer to page 25 (Audit Committee Report) and page 50 
(financial disclosures).
The risk 
 + Forecast-based valuation – The parent company balance sheet 
includes an investment in a trading subsidiary of £15.4m and a 
receivable from that subsidiary of £11.0m. The subsidiary currently 
has no revenues and therefore the Company’s assessment of 
potential impairment is inherently subjective. There is a risk 
that the investment and/or the receivable may be impaired.
Our response 
Our procedures included:
 + Comparing valuations – We reviewed external third party 
specialist valuation reports which valued the two assets that 
the subsidiary is currently developing, and compared the total 
to the carrying value of the investment and the receivable 
recorded in the parent company. 
 + Assessing valuers’ credentials – We assessed the qualifications, 
experience, and objectivity of the asset valuation specialists 
whose reports we reviewed. 
3 Our application of materiality and 
an overview of the scope of our audit 
Materiality for the Group financial statements as a whole was set 
at £460,000 (2016: £318,000), determined with reference to a 
benchmark of Group loss before taxation, of which it represents 
3.8% (2016: 4.5%).
Materiality for the parent company financial statements as a 
whole was set at £390,000 (2016: £318,000), determined with 
reference to a benchmark of Company net assets, of which it 
represents 0.9% (2016: 0.8%). 
We agreed to report to the Audit Committee any corrected 
or uncorrected identified misstatements exceeding £23,000 
(2016: £16,000), in addition to other identified misstatements 
that warranted reporting on qualitative grounds. 3 7  Diurnal Group plc _ Annual Report 2017
3 Our application of materiality and 
an overview of the scope of our audit 
continued
Audits for Group reporting purposes were performed by the 
Group audit team at all 2 (2016: 2) of the Group’s reporting 
components, all of which are in the UK. These audits covered 
100% (2016: 100%) of: total Group revenue, Group loss before 
taxation and total Group assets. Component materiality levels 
were set individually for both components having regard to the 
mix of size and risk profile of the Group across the components, 
and was £390,000 in each case (2016: £295,000 to £318,000). 
4 We have nothing to report on going concern
We are required to report to you if we have concluded that the 
use of the going concern basis of accounting is inappropriate 
or there is an undisclosed material uncertainty that may cast 
significant doubt over the use of that basis for a period of at 
least twelve months from the date of approval of the financial 
statements. We have nothing to report in these respects. 
5 We have nothing to report on the other 
information in the Annual Report 
The Directors are responsible for the other information presented 
in the Annual Report together with the financial statements. 
Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other 
information and, accordingly, we do not express an audit opinion 
or, except as explicitly stated below, any form of assurance 
conclusion thereon. 
Our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing 
so, consider whether, based on our financial statements audit 
work, the information therein is materially misstated or inconsistent 
with the financial statements or our audit knowledge. Based solely 
on that work we have not identified material misstatements in the 
other information. 
Strategic report and Directors’ report 
Based solely on our work on the other information: 
 + we have not identified material misstatements in the strategic 
report and the Directors’ report; 
 + in our opinion the information given in those reports for the 
financial year is consistent with the financial statements; and 
 + in our opinion those reports have been prepared in accordance 
with the Companies Act 2006. 
6 We have nothing to report on the other matters 
on which we are required to report by exception 
Under the Companies Act 2006, we are required to report to you 
if, in our opinion: 
 + adequate accounting records have not been kept by the parent 
company, or returns adequate for our audit have not been 
received from branches not visited by us; or 
 + the parent company financial statements are not in agreement 
with the accounting records and returns; or 
 + certain disclosures of Directors’ remuneration specified by law 
are not made; or 
 + we have not received all the information and explanations we 
require for our audit. 
We have nothing to report in these respects. 
7 Respective responsibilities 
Directors’ responsibilities 
As explained more fully in their statement set out on page 34, 
the Directors are responsible for: the preparation of the financial 
statements including being satisfied that they give a true and fair 
view; such internal control as they determine is necessary to 
enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from 
material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error; assessing 
the Group and parent company’s ability to continue as a going 
concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going 
concern; and using the going concern basis of accounting unless 
they either intend to liquidate the Group or the parent company or 
to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so. 
Auditor’s responsibilities 
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether 
the financial statements as a whole are free from material 
misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue our 
opinion in an auditor’s report. Reasonable assurance is a high 
level of assurance, but does not guarantee that an audit conducted 
in accordance with ISAs (UK) will always detect a material 
misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud 
or error and are considered material if, individually or in aggregate, 
they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic 
decisions of users taken on the basis of the financial statements.
A fuller description of our responsibilities is provided on the 
FRC’s website at www.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities. 
8 The purpose of our audit work and to whom 
we owe our responsibilities 
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body, 
in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 
2006. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might 
state to the Company’s members those matters we are required 
to state to them in an auditor’s report and for no other purpose. 
To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or 
assume responsibility to anyone other than the Company and 
the Company’s members, as a body, for our audit work, for this 
report, or for the opinions we have formed.

Notes to the ﬁnancial statements
1 Corporate information
The consolidated financial statements of Diurnal Group plc and its subsidiary (collectively, the “Group”) for the year ended 30 June 2017 
were authorised for issue in accordance with a resolution of the Directors on 5 September 2017 . Diurnal Group plc (the “Company” or the 
“parent”) is a public limited company incorporated and domiciled in the United Kingdom, and registered in England (registered number: 
09846650), whose shares are publicly traded. The registered office is located at Cardiff Medicentre, Heath Park, Cardiff CF14 4UJ.
The Group is a clinical stage specialty pharmaceutical business targeting patient needs in chronic endocrine (hormonal) diseases. Information 
on the Group’s structure is provided in Note 12. Information on other related party relationships of the Group is provided in Note 22.
To facilitate its IPO in December 2015, the Company was incorporated as Project Dime Limited on 28 October 2015, acquired the entire 
issued share capital of Diurnal Limited under a share for share exchange on 1 December 2015 and reregistered as a public company and 
changed its name to Diurnal Group plc on 4 December 2015. The Company has applied the principles of reverse acquisition accounting 
in the preparation of the consolidated financial information.
2 Significant accounting policies and basis of preparation
2.1 Significant accounting policies
The accounting policies set out below have, unless otherwise stated, been applied consistently to all years presented in the Group and 
parent company financial statements.
Foreign currency
Transactions in foreign currencies are translated to the Group’s functional currency at the foreign exchange rate ruling at the date of the 
transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the balance sheet date are retranslated to the functional 
currency at the foreign exchange rate ruling at that date. Foreign exchange differences arising on translation are recognised in the income 
statement. Non-monetary assets and liabilities that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using 
the exchange rate at the date of the transaction. Non-monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies that are stated 
at fair value are retranslated to the functional currency at foreign exchange rates ruling at the dates the fair value was determined.
Classification of financial instruments issued by the Company
Financial instruments issued by the Company are treated as equity only to the extent that they meet the following two conditions: 
(a)  they include no contractual obligations upon the Company to deliver cash or other financial assets or to exchange financial assets 
or financial liabilities with another party under conditions that are potentially unfavourable to the Company; and 
(b)  where the instrument will or may be settled in the Company’s own equity instruments, it is either a non-derivative that includes 
no obligation to deliver a variable number of the Company’s own equity instruments or is a derivative that will be settled by the 
Company’s exchanging a fixed amount of cash or other financial assets for a fixed number of its own equity instruments.
To the extent that this definition is not met, the proceeds of issue are classified as a financial liability. Where the instrument so classified 
takes the legal form of the Company’s own shares, the amounts presented in these financial statements for called up share capital and 
share premium account exclude amounts in relation to those shares.
Where a financial instrument that contains both equity and financial liability components exists these components are separated and accounted 
for individually under the above policy. The liability component is fair valued using appropriate valuation assumptions and the remaining 
amount is deemed to be the equity component.
Non-derivative financial instruments
Non-derivative financial instruments comprise investments in equity and debt securities, trade and other receivables, held to maturity 
financial assets, cash and cash equivalents, loans and borrowings, and trade and other payables.
Trade and other receivables
Trade and other receivables are recognised initially at fair value. Subsequent to initial recognition they are measured at amortised 
cost using the effective interest method, less any impairment losses.
Trade and other payables
Trade and other payables are recognised initially at fair value. Subsequent to initial recognition they are measured at amortised 
cost using the effective interest method.
Held to maturity financial assets
Held to maturity financial assets comprise term deposits with an original maturity of more than three months.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash balances, call deposits and term deposits with an original maturity of less than three months.
Interest-bearing loans and borrowings
Interest-bearing loans and borrowings are recognised initially at fair value less attributable transaction costs. Subsequent to initial 
recognition, interest-bearing borrowings are stated at amortised cost using the effective interest method, less any impairment losses. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

2 Significant accounting policies and basis of preparation continued
2.1 Significant accounting policies continued
Intangible assets 
Research and development
Expenditure on research and development activities is recognised in the income statement as an expense as incurred.
Expenditure on research and development activities is capitalised if the product or process is technically and commercially feasible 
and the Group intends to and has the technical ability and sufficient resources to complete development, future economic benefits 
are probable and if the Group can measure reliably the expenditure attributable to the intangible asset during its development. 
Development activities involve a plan or design for the production of new or substantially improved products or processes. The 
expenditure capitalised includes the cost of materials, direct labour and an appropriate proportion of overheads and capitalised 
borrowing costs. Other development expenditure is recognised in the income statement as an expense as incurred. Capitalised 
development expenditure is stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and less accumulated impairment losses.
The Group’s activities are not considered to meet all of the conditions above and therefore all related expenditure has been recognised 
as an expense in the Income Statement; there has been no capitalisation of research and development costs.
Expenditure in relation to patents registration and renewal of current patents are also expensed in the Income Statement. Patents acquired 
or licensed from third parties of patents are capitalised as intangible assets and are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and less 
accumulated impairment losses.
Amortisation
Amortisation is charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the patents. Patent assets 
are amortised from the date they are available for use. The estimated useful lives are as follows:
Patents and licences ten years
Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Cost comprises the purchase price plus any incidental 
costs of acquisition and commissioning. Depreciation is calculated to write-off the cost, less residual value, in equal annual instalments 
over their estimated useful lives as follows:
Equipment three years
The residual value, if not insignificant, is reassessed annually.
Expenses
Financing income and expenses
Financing expenses comprise interest payable and finance charges on shares classified as liabilities. Financing income comprise interest 
receivable on funds invested and dividend income.
Interest income and interest payable is recognised in the Income Statement as it accrues, using the effective interest method. 
Dividend income is recognised in the Income Statement on the date the entity’s right to receive payments is established.
Taxation
Tax on the profit or loss for the year comprises current and deferred tax. Tax is recognised in the income statement except to the extent 
that it relates to items recognised directly in equity, in which case it is recognised in equity.
Current tax is the expected tax payable or receivable on the taxable income or loss for the year, using tax rates enacted or substantively 
enacted at the balance sheet date, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years. In prior periods, the UK R&D Tax Credits 
that are payable to the Company were recognised when approved by the UK HM Revenue & Customs (HMRC), reflecting the limited 
history of making R&D Tax Credit claims to HMRC. In light of having established a history of R&D Tax Credit claims, with effect from the 
year ended 30 June 2017 the Group will recognise R&D Tax Credit claims on an accruals basis. Any such accrued amounts are estimates 
since they have not yet been agreed with HMRC.
A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the 
temporary difference can be utilised. 
Employee benefits
Share-based payments
In accordance with IFRS 2 ‘Share-based Payment’, share options are measured at fair value at their grant date. The fair value for the majority 
of the options is calculated using the Black Scholes formula and charged to the Income Statement on a straight-line basis over the expected 
vesting period. At each year end date, the Company revises its estimate of the number of options that are expected to become exercisable. 
This estimate is not revised according to estimates of changes in market based conditions. A deemed grant date of the first day of the 
financial year in which performance must be achieved is assumed, in order to account for share awards under the deferred share 
element of the annual bonus scheme.
Where the Company grants options over its own shares to the employees of its subsidiaries it recognises, in its individual financial statements, 
an increase in the cost of investment in its subsidiaries equivalent to the equity-settled share-based payment charge recognised in its 
consolidated financial statements with the corresponding credit being recognised directly in equity. Amounts recharged to the subsidiary 
are recognised as a reduction in the cost of investment in subsidiary . If the amount recharged exceeds the increase in the cost of investment 
the excess is recognised as a dividend. 45  Diurnal Group plc _ Annual Report 2017
2 Significant accounting policies and basis of preparation continued
2.1 Significant accounting policies continued
Employee benefits continued
Post retirement benefits
The Group operates a defined contribution pension scheme. Contributions to the pension scheme are expensed as they fall due. 
Provisions
A provision is recognised in the balance sheet when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event 
that can be reliably measured and it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation. In addition 
to the pension contribution provision, the Group has created a provision for the employer National Insurance contributions due on 
share-based payments that are not HMRC tax-advantaged.
Operating income
Grant income is in relation to government grants and is recognised when there is reasonable assurance that the physical payment will 
be received and the attached conditions have been complied with. When the grant relates to an expense item, it is recognised as other 
operating income on a systematic basis over the time periods that the costs, which it is intended to compensate, are expensed.
2.2 Basis of preparation
The consolidated financial information has been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted 
by the European Union, IFRIC interpretations and the Companies Act 2006. The financial information contained in these financial statements 
have been prepared under the historical cost convention, and on a going concern basis.
The Company has elected to take the exemption under section 408 of the Companies Act 2006 not to present the parent company’s Income 
Statement. The parent company’s result for the year ended 30 June 2017 was a profit of £154k (year ended 30 June 2016: loss of £533k).
The separate financial statements of the Company had previously been presented in accordance with FRS101 Reduced Disclosure Framework. 
For the year ended 30 June 2017 , the decision was taken to present the separate financial statements of the Company in accordance with 
International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted by the European Union, IFRIC interpretations and the Companies Act 2006, 
consistent with the presentation of the consolidated financial statements. There are no differences between the accounting policies under 
IFRS compared with FRS101; consequently the application of IFRS to the separate financial statements of the Company did not give rise to any 
transition adjustments for the comparative financial information.
The accounting policies used in the financial information are consistent with those used in the prior year. The following adopted IFRSs 
have been issued but have not been applied by the Group in these financial statements. Their adoption is not expected to have a material 
effect on the financial statements unless otherwise indicated:
 + IFRS 2 Share-based payment amendments to clarify the classification and measurement of share-based payment transactions 
effective 1 January 2018
 + IFRS 9 Financial Instruments effective 1 January 2018
 + IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers effective 1 January 2018
 + IFRS 16 Leases effective 1 January 2019
 + IFRS 17 Insurance contracts effective 1 January 2021
 + IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements Amendments as result of the Disclosure initiative effective 1 January 2017
 + IAS 7 Statement of Cash Flows Amendments as result of the Disclosure initiative effective 1 January 2017
 + IAS 12 Income Taxes Amendments regarding the recognition of deferred tax assets for unrealised losses effective 1 January 2017
 + IAS 40 Investment Property Amendments to clarify transfers of property to, or from, investment property effective 1 January 2018
The preparation of financial information in conformity with IFRS requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect 
the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses 
during the reporting period. Although these estimates are based on management’s best knowledge of the amount, event or actions, 
actual events ultimately may differ from those estimates.
2.3 Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty
In the application of the Group’s and Company’s accounting policies, which are described in Note 2, management is required to make 
judgements, estimates and assumptions about the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.
The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the 
period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period or in the period of the revision and future periods if the 
revision affects both current and future periods.
The critical accounting judgements relate to the share options and deferred share bonus awards, which are described in Note 19 
and to the convertible loan, which is described in Note 17; the key judgement being the discount rate, assumed as 8%. 
The fair value of financial instruments that are not traded in an active market is determined by using valuation techniques. The Group 
has used a binomial model and makes assumptions that are based on market conditions existing at each statement of financial position 
date. These comprise level 2 financial instruments. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

2.3 Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty continued
Capitalisation of development costs
Capitalisation of development costs requires analysis of the technical feasibility and commercial viability of the project concerned. Capitalisation 
of the costs will only be made where there is evidence that an economic benefit will flow to the Company. To date no development 
costs have been capitalised and all costs have been expensed to the income statement as research and development expenditure.
Deferred tax assets
Estimates of future profitability are required for the decision whether or not to create a deferred tax asset. To date no deferred tax 
assets have been recognised. 
2.4 Going concern 
Though the Group and Company continue to make losses, the Directors believe it is appropriate to prepare the financial information 
on the going concern basis. This is because the Group’s research into new products continues to progress according to plan and the 
funding secured at the IPO in December 2015 will allow it to meet its liabilities as they fall due for at least twelve months from the date 
of authorisation for the issue of these consolidated financial statements.
2.5 Summary of impact of Group restructure and Initial Public Offering
On 24 December 2015, the Company listed its shares on AIM. In preparation for this Initial Public Offering (“IPO”) the Group was 
restructured. The restructure has impacted a number of the current year and comparative primary financial statements and notes.
For the consolidated financial statements of the Group, prepared under IFRS, the principles of reverse acquisition accounting under 
IFRS 3 ‘Business Combinations’ have been applied. The steps to restructure the Group had the effect of Diurnal Group plc being inserted 
above Diurnal Limited as the holder of the Diurnal Limited share capital.
By applying the principles of reverse acquisition accounting, the Group is presented as if Diurnal Group plc has always owned Diurnal 
Limited. The comparative Income Statement and Balance Sheet are presented in line with the previously presented Diurnal Limited 
position. The comparative and current year consolidated reserves of the Group are adjusted to reflect the statutory share capital and 
share premium of Diurnal Group plc as if it had always existed, adjusted for movements in the underlying Diurnal Limited share capital 
and reserves until the share for share exchange.
The steps taken to restructure the Group are explained in more detail in the Group Reorganisation section below. The impact on the 
primary consolidated financial statements is as follows:
 + Equity reflects the capital structure of Diurnal Group plc. As part of the restructuring of the Group and the IPO, a number of shares 
in Diurnal Group plc were issued in exchange for cash. The premium arising on the issue of shares is allocated to share premium.
 + A consolidation reserve was created and reflects the difference between the Diurnal Group plc reserves at the balance sheet date as 
reflected in the opening reserves at the start of the comparative period (28 May 2014) and the equity of Diurnal Limited at the same date.
Fees associated with the IPO are allocated to share premium and the Consolidated Income Statement depending on the nature of the costs.
Group reorganisation
Prior to IPO the Group undertook a reorganisation in preparation for the transaction.
The effect of this reorganisation was to insert a new ultimate parent company, Diurnal Group plc, into the Group. This company 
acquired the entire issued share capital of Diurnal Limited, as summarised below.
Diurnal Group plc became the ultimate parent company of the Group by acquiring Diurnal Limited in exchange for the issue of new shares.
The key steps of the process were as follows:
 + On incorporation on 28 October 2015, one ordinary share of £1 was allotted and issued.
 + On 1 December 2015, a number of further changes to the share capital occurred:
 + a share subdivision whereby the ordinary share of £1 each was subdivided into two ordinary shares of 50 pence each;
 + in accordance with the terms of a share for share exchange agreement, the allotment and issue of 30,267,498 ordinary shares 
of 50 pence each and 4,395,000 B shares of 5 pence each in consideration for the entire issued share capital of Diurnal Limited. 
Following the conclusion of this share for share exchange, which involved nil cash consideration, Diurnal Limited became a wholly 
owned subsidiary undertaking of the Company; and
 + the nominal value of the 30,267,498 ordinary shares of 50 pence were reduced to 10 pence.
 + On 23 December 2015, 83,038 ordinary shares of 10 pence each were allotted and issued to the Enterprise Investment Scheme 
investors participating in the IPO placing of shares.
 + On 24 December, 30,350,538 ordinary shares of 10 pence each were subdivided and reclassified into 30,350,538 ordinary shares of 5 pence 
each and 30,350,538 deferred share of 5 pence each. Thereafter, a number of further changes to the share capital occurred, which were 
conditional upon and immediately prior to admission of the Company’s shares to trading on AIM and simultaneous with each other:
 + the conversion of 4,339,500 B shares of 5 pence each into 4,339,500 ordinary shares of 5 pence each;
 + the reduction of the Company’s share capital by £1,517,526.90 representing the aggregate nominal value of the 30,350,538 
deferred share of 5 pence each, as a result of the transfer of the deferred shares to the Company for nil consideration and their 
subsequent cancellation; and
 + the allotment and issue of 17,520,721 ordinary shares of 5 pence each to investors participating in the IPO placing of shares. 47  Diurnal Group plc _ Annual Report 2017
3 Segmental information
The Board regularly reviews the Company’s performance and balance sheet position for its operations and receives financial information 
for the Group as a whole. As a consequence, the Group has one reportable segment, which is Clinical Development. Segmental profit is 
measured at operating loss level, as shown on the face of the Consolidated Income Statement. As there is only one reportable segment 
whose losses, expenses, assets, liabilities and cash flows are measured and reported on a basis consistent with the financial statements, 
no additional numerical disclosures are necessary.

8 Taxation
The Group is entitled to claim tax credits in the United Kingdom under the UK research and development (R&D) small or medium-sized 
enterprise (SME) scheme, which provides additional taxation relief for qualifying expenditure on R&D activities, and includes an option 
to surrender a portion of tax losses arising from qualifying activities in return for a cash payment from HM Revenue & Customs (HMRC). 
The tax credit included in the Income Statement for the year ended 30 June 2016 reflected the approval by HMRC of the R&D tax 
credit claim in respect of the 13-month period ended 30 June 2015 with effect from the year ended 30 June 2017, the Group will reflect 
R&D tax credits on an accruals basis since it has established a track record of agreeing claims with HMRC. Consequently, the Income 
Statement for the year ended 30 June 2017 reflects the R&D tax credit claim for the year ended 30 June 2016, which was approved 
by HMRC in July 2017, along with the estimated claim for the year ended 30 June 2017. The amount in respect of the year ended 
30 June 2017 has not yet been agreed with HMRC, although there is no reason to believe that this claim will be rejected.

The Group has accumulated losses to carry forward against future profits of £14.7m (2016: £8.5m). No deferred tax asset has been 
recognised in respect of tax losses since it is uncertain at the balance sheet date as to whether future profits will be available against 
which the unused tax losses can be utilised due to the uncertainty of availability of future taxable profits. The estimated value of the 
deferred tax asset not recognised, measured at a standard rate of 17% is £2.5m (2016: £2.3m).
The standard rate of UK corporation tax was reduced from 20% to 19% with effect from 1 April 2017, giving rise to an effective rate of tax 
for the year ended 30 June 2017 of 19.75%.

loan agreement. The convertible loan facility is interest-free and unsecured with a maturity date of 24 December 2020 (or such other date 
as the parties may agree) at which point the Company may either repay the principal amount outstanding in full or convert such amount 
into non-voting shares at a lower nominal value to that of the Ordinary Shares to ensure that IP2IPO Limited did not have control of the 
Company. IP2IPO Limited may convert the principal outstanding in whole or in parts exceeding £0.1m into ordinary shares calculated 
at the IPO share price of £1.44 per share conditional on it not having control of the Company resulting from the conversion.
The convertible loan note is a compound financial instrument containing a host financial liability and an equity component as there is

19 Share based payments
At 30 June 2017, the Group and Company had two types of share based payment awards, share options (including performance share 
awards) and deferred share bonus awards. All outstanding Diurnal Limited share option awards have been exchanged for equivalent awards 
in Diurnal Group plc and the numbers and values in this note have been restated to reflect the Group reorganisation conducted 
in December 2015 and allow for consistency of analysis.
Share options
Share options have been issued over time as follows:
Diurnal Limited unapproved share options
Between 2007 and 2012, 1,898,500 share options were awarded to four individuals, being Executive and Non-Executive Directors 
and a consultant. All these options vested prior to the AIM IPO.
In September 2015, 729,000 share options were awarded to three individuals, being Executive and Non-Executive Directors and a 
consultant. These options vest in equal tranches on the first three anniversaries of their grant. No further awards are to be made.
Diurnal Limited share option scheme
1,108,500 share options awarded to eight individuals, being employees. These options vest in equal tranches on the first three 
anniversaries of their grant. No further awards are to be made.
Diurnal Group plc unapproved share options
104,421 share options and 32,374 share awards awarded to two individuals, being Non-Executive Directors to whom commitments had 
been made prior to the AIM IPO. The options vest in equal tranches on the first three anniversaries of the AIM IPO and the awards vest 
in equal tranches on the 18, 24 and 36 month anniversaries of the AIM IPO. The awards are in lieu of part of the Director’s annual fees.
Performance share awards under the Diurnal Group plc Long Term Incentive Plan (LTIP)
The main scheme for future awards is the Diurnal Group plc Long T erm Incentive Plan (LTIP). The LTIP was established on 21 December 2015 
and is a discretionary plan pursuant to which awards may be made in the form of performance share awards, restricted share awards, 
deferred bonus awards and market value option awards.
Eligibility
Any employee (including an Executive Director) of the Company and its subsidiaries will be eligible to participate in the LTIP at the discretion 
of the Remuneration Committee, subject to individual limits and grant timing requirements operated by the Remuneration Committee.
Performance conditions
The extent of vesting of any performance share awards or market value option awards granted will be subject to performance conditions 
set by the Remuneration Committee. No performance conditions shall apply in the case of restricted share awards and deferred bonus awards.
Vesting
Performance shares awards, restricted share awards and market value options normally vest on the third anniversary of grant or, if later, 
when the Remuneration Committee determines the extent to which any performance conditions have been satisfied. Deferred bonus 
awards normally vest on the first anniversary of grant. The Remuneration Committee may specify different vesting periods in relation 
to awards granted to participants who are not Executive Directors.
Where awards are granted in the form of options, once vested, such options will then be exercisable up until the tenth anniversary of 
grant (or such shorter period specified by the Remuneration Committee at the time of grant) unless they lapse earlier. Shorter exercise 
periods shall apply in the case of “good leavers” and/or vesting of awards in connection with corporate events. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

IFRS 2 valuation – share options issued under the LTIP
The fair value of services received in return for performance share awards, restricted share awards, and market value option awards 
issued under the LTIP (but excluding deferred bonus awards) are measured by reference to the fair value of share options granted. 
The fair value of the share options granted is measured by using a Black Scholes valuation model, using the following inputs:
 + The expected volatility is based on historical volatility of a peer group of companies over a relevant period prior to the grants. 
As the Company’s share price history on AIM increases, it will be combined with the peer group volatility.
 + The expected life is the average expected period to exercise, which has been taken as five years for share options and a shorter period 
for the share awards.
 + The risk-free rate of return is the yield as at the grant date on zero coupon UK government bonds of a term commensurate with 
the expected life.

Deferred share bonus awards 
The Group and Company operates a discretionary annual bonus scheme, under which any annual bonus for Executive Directors and 
certain other employees will be paid in a specified mix of cash and deferred share awards by individual. Deferred share awards will be 
awarded under the deferred share award feature of the LTIP. The number of Ordinary Shares comprising the deferred share awards will 
be set on grant to equal such number equal in value to the portion of the bonus being deferred (adjusted as necessary to neutralise the 
cost of exercise where awards are structured as nominal cost options). Such deferred share awards will ordinarily vest after one year, 
subject only to continued employment.
The Remuneration Committee will set performance targets for the annual bonus plan at the start of each financial year. 55  Diurnal Group plc _ Annual Report 2017

IFRS 2 Valuation
The fair value of services received in return for the deferred share award element of the annual bonus scheme is calculated at the start 
of the financial year to which the bonus relates, the deemed grant date, rather than at the actual grant date of the deferred share award 
(after publication of the Annual Report relating to the bonus year and is measured by reference to the fair value of share options granted. 
The fair value of the share options granted is measured by using a Black Scholes valuation model, using the following inputs:
 + The expected volatility is based on historical volatility of a peer group of companies over a relevant period prior to the grants. 
As the Company’s share price history on AIM increases, it will be combined with the peer group volatility.
 + The expected life is the average expected period to exercise, which has been taken as 34 months.

20 Financial instruments
The Group’s and Company’s activities expose it to a variety of financial risks: credit risk, liquidity risk and market risk (including foreign 
currency risk and interest rate risk. This note address each of these matters in turn, and also gives details of financial assets and liabilities 
with a carrying value that is materially different to their fair value and the Group’s capital management objectives. 
Capital management
The Group considers capital to comprise the total equity and reserves of the Group and long term debt financing, including convertible 
loans issued. The Group’s objectives are to manage capital as a primary source of funding in conjunction with the ability to remain as a 
going concern.
Treasury policy
The Group has financed its operations by a mixture of shareholders’ funds and other borrowings and loan notes, as required. The Group’s 
objective has been to obtain sufficient funding to meet development activities until the Group becomes profitable. During the year and 
for the foreseeable future the Group’s objective in using financial instruments is to safeguard the principal for funds held on deposit and 
to minimise currency risk where appropriate.
Interest rate risk
The Group has an outstanding interest free convertible loan at 30 June 2017 with an outstanding principal amount of £4.7m (30 June 2016: £4.7m) 
and invests its surplus funds in money market and short-term bank deposits. The Group would review the balance between fixed and 
floating rate debt if it takes on any future debt.
Liquidity risk
The Group prepares periodic working capital forecasts for the foreseeable future, allowing an assessment of the cash requirements of 
the Group, to manage liquidity risk. The Group also ensures that sufficient funds are available on 24 hours’ notice to fund the Company’s 
immediate needs (see Note 2 – Basis of Preparation).
The Group finances its operations through the issue of equity shares. The Group manages its liquidity risk by monitoring existing and 
committed funding against forecast requirements (with particular reference to non-discretionary expenditure). The following are the 
contractual maturities of financial liabilities, including estimated interest payments.

between the Company and IP2IPO Limited, the lender and the loan could be converted into equity. 5 7  Diurnal Group plc _ Annual Report 2017

Currency risk
The Group manages foreign currency exposure by matching expected currency outflows with inflows of the same currency to the extent 
possible. The Group would consider hedging instruments if there was considered to be a significant mismatch but this has not proven 
necessary to date.
The following table considers the impact of several changes to the spot £/Euro and US Dollar exchange rates of +/– 1%, assuming all 
other variables remain constant. If these changes were to occur the figures in the table below reflect the impact on loss before tax.

The Group is exposed to credit risk from one source, namely its cash investments. The Group minimises this risk by placing its cash 
deposits only with established financial institutions with a minimum credit rating of A- as defined by the three major credit rating agencies.

Convertible loan agreement
IP2IPO Limited, a wholly owned subsidiary of IP Group plc provided the Company with £4,650,588 of debt financing under a convertible 
loan agreement. The convertible loan facility is interest-free and unsecured with a maturity date of 24 December 2020 (or such other 
date as the parties may agree) at which point the Company may either repay the principal amount outstanding in full or convert such 
amount into non-voting shares at a lower nominal value to that of the Ordinary Shares to ensure that IP2IPO Limited did not have control 
of the Company. IP2IPO Limited may convert the principal outstanding in whole or in parts exceeding £0.1m into ordinary shares calculated 
at the IPO share price of £1.44 per share conditional on it not having control of the Company resulting from the conversion.

Notes
Entitlement to attend and vote
1.  The right to vote at the meeting is determined by reference to the register of members. Only those shareholders registered in the 
register of members of the Company as at close of business on 17 November 2017 (or, if the meeting is adjourned, on the date which 
is two working days before the date of the adjourned meeting) shall be entitled to attend and vote at the meeting in respect of the 
number of shares registered in their name at that time. Changes to entries in the register of members after that time shall be disregarded 
in determining the rights of any person to attend or vote (and the number of votes they may cast) at the meeting.
2.  A “vote withheld” is not a vote in law, which means that the vote will not be counted in the calculation of votes “for” or “against” 
the resolution. If no voting indication is given, your proxy will vote or abstain from voting at his or her discretion. Your proxy will 
vote (or abstain from voting) as he or she thinks fit in relation to any other matter which is put before the annual general meeting.
Proxies
3.  A shareholder is entitled to appoint another person as his or her proxy to exercise all or any of his or her rights to attend and to 
speak and vote at the meeting. A proxy need not be a shareholder of the Company.
  A shareholder may appoint more than one proxy in relation to the meeting, provided that each proxy is appointed to exercise the 
rights attached to a different share or shares held by that shareholder. Failure to specify the number of shares each proxy appointment 
relates to or specifying a number which when taken together with the numbers of shares set out in the other proxy appointments 
is in excess of the number of shares held by the shareholder may result in the proxy appointment being invalid.
 A proxy may only be appointed in accordance with the procedures set out in notes 3 and 4 below and the notes to the proxy form.
 The appointment of a proxy will not preclude a shareholder from attending and voting in person at the meeting.
  In the case of joint holders, where more than one of the joint holders purports to appoint a proxy, only the appointment submitted 
by the most senior holder will be accepted. Seniority is determined by the order in which the names of the joint holders appear in 
the Company’s register of members in respect of the joint holding (the first-named being the most senior).
4.  A form of proxy is enclosed. When appointing more than one proxy, complete a separate proxy form in relation to each appointment. 
Additional proxy forms may be obtained by contacting the Company’s registrar, Capita Asset Services, on 0371 664 0300 (Calls cost 
12 pence per minute plus your phone company’s access charge. Calls outside the United Kingdom will be charged at the applicable 
international rate. The Company’s registrar is open between 09.00 – 17.30, Monday to Friday excluding public holidays in England 
and Wales) or the proxy form may be photocopied. State clearly on each proxy form the number of shares in relation to which the 
proxy is appointed.
  To be valid, a proxy form must be completed and signed and sent by post or delivered (during normal business hours only) by hand 
so as to be received at the offices of the Company’s registrar, Capita Asset Services PXS 1, 34 Beckenham Road, Beckenham BR3 4ZF, 
no later than 11.00 a.m. on 17 November 2017 (or , if the meeting is adjourned, no later than 48 hours before the time of any adjourned meeting).
  In the case of an individual, a form of proxy must be signed by that individual or his attorney. In the case of a corporation, a form 
of proxy must be executed under its common seal or signed on its behalf by its duly authorised officer, attorney or other person 
authorised to sign.
5. The notes to the proxy form explain how to direct your proxy to vote on each resolution or to withhold their vote. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

6.  CREST members who wish to appoint a proxy or proxies for the meeting (or any adjournment of it) through the CREST electronic 
proxy appointment service may do so by using the procedures described in the CREST Manual. CREST personal members or other 
CREST sponsored members, and those CREST members who have appointed a voting service provider(s), should refer to their 
CREST sponsor or voting service provider(s), who will be able to take the appropriate action on their behalf.
  In order for a proxy appointment or instruction made using the CREST service to be valid, the appropriate CREST message (a “CREST 
Proxy Instruction”) must be properly authenticated in accordance with Euroclear UK & Ireland Limited’s specifications and must contain 
the information required for such instructions, as described in the CREST Manual. The message, regardless of whether it constitutes 
the appointment of a proxy or is an amendment to the instruction given to a previously appointed proxy, must, in order to be valid, 
be transmitted so as to be received by Capita Asset Services (ID RA10) no later than 11.00 a.m. on 17 November 2017 (or, if the meeting 
is adjourned, no later than 48 hours before the time of any adjourned meeting). For this purpose, the time of receipt will be taken to be 
the time (as determined by the timestamp applied to the message by the CREST Applications Host) from which Capita Asset Services 
is able to retrieve the message by enquiry to CREST in the manner prescribed by CREST. After this time, any change of instructions 
to proxies appointed through CREST should be communicated to the appointee through other means.
  CREST members and, where applicable, their CREST sponsors or voting service providers should note that Euroclear UK & Ireland Limited 
does not make available special procedures in CREST for any particular messages. Normal system timings and limitations will therefore 
apply in relation to the input of CREST Proxy Instructions. It is the responsibility of the CREST member concerned to take (or, if the 
CREST member is a CREST personal member or sponsored member or has appointed a voting service provider(s), to procure that 
his or her CREST sponsor or voting service provider(s) take(s)) such action as shall be necessary to ensure that a message is transmitted 
by means of the CREST system by any particular time. In this connection, CREST members and, where applicable, their CREST 
sponsors or voting service providers are referred, in particular, to those sections of the CREST Manual concerning practical 
limitations of the CREST system and timings.
  The Company may treat a CREST Proxy Instruction as invalid in the circumstances set out in Regulation 35(5)(a) of the Uncertificated 
Securities Regulations 2001.
Corporate representatives
7.  A shareholder which is a corporation may authorise one or more persons to act as its representative(s) at the meeting. Each such 
representative may exercise (on behalf of the corporation) the same powers as the corporation could exercise if it were an individual 
shareholder, provided that (where there is more than one representative and the vote is otherwise than on a show of hands) they do 
not do so in relation to the same shares.
Documents available for inspection
8.  The following documents will be available for inspection during normal business hours at the registered office of the Company from 
the date of this notice until the time of the meeting. They will also be available for inspection at the place of the meeting from at least 
15 minutes before the meeting until it ends.
 8.1 Copies of the service contracts of the executive Directors.
 8.2 Copies of the letters of appointment of the Non-Executive Directors.
Biographical details of Directors
9.  Biographical details of all those Directors who are offering themselves for reappointment at the meeting are set out on pages 22 
and 23 of the enclosed annual report and accounts.
Voting rights
10.  As at 6.00 p.m. on 13 October 2017, the Company’s issued share capital comprised 52,449,759 ordinary shares of £0.05 each. Each 
ordinary share carries the right to one vote at a general meeting of the Company and, therefore, the total number of voting rights in the 
Company as at 6.00 p.m. on 13 October 2017 is 52,449,759. The Company has no treasury shares. 6 3  Diurnal Group plc _ Annual Report 2017

may photocopy this form. You will need to state clearly on each form the number of shares in relation to which the proxy is appointed. 
Please therefore indicate in the box next to the name of the proxy the number of shares in relation to which they are authorised to 
act as your proxy. Please also indicate by ticking the box provided if the proxy instruction is one of multiple instructions being given.

proxy appointment relates to or specifying a number in excess of the number of shares held by you may result in the proxy 
appointment being invalid.
4.  Completion and return of this form of proxy will not preclude you from attending and voting in person at the meeting if you wish. 
If you do attend the meeting in person, your proxy appointments will automatically be terminated. If you wish a proxy to make any 
comments on your behalf, you will need to appoint someone other than the Chairman of the meeting and give them the relevant 
instructions directly.
5.  If you want your proxy to vote in a certain way on the resolutions specified, please indicate with an “X” in the appropriate box above 
how you wish your vote to be cast. If you fail to select any of the given options, your proxy can vote as he or she chooses or can 
decide not to vote at all. Your proxy can also do this on any other business which may come before the meeting, including 
amendments to resolutions and any procedural business.
6.  The “vote withheld” option on this form of proxy is provided to enable you to instruct your proxy not to vote on any particular resolution. 
However, a “vote withheld” is not a vote in law and will not be counted in the calculation of the votes “for” and “against” a resolution.
7.  In the case of an individual, this form of proxy must be signed by that individual or his attorney. In the case of a corporation, this 
form of proxy must be executed under its common seal or signed on its behalf by its duly authorised officer, attorney or other person 
authorised to sign.
8.  In the case of joint holders, only one need sign, but the names of all the joint holders must be stated. The vote of the senior joint 
holder who tenders a vote, whether in person or by proxy, shall be accepted to the exclusion of the votes of other joint holders. 
For this purpose, seniority shall be determined by the order in which the names appear in the register of members in respect of 
the joint holding.
